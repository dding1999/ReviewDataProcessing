$REVIEW.: While no one can question the landmark status of Luxo Jr., and For the Birds is arguably the funniest short film to be produced in the last 20 years, all of the material on this disc has been available elsewhere for some time.  And if you happen to have previously purchased Ratatouille and Cars on Blu-ray, you already have HD versions of some of this material, rendering this disc even less essential.The supplemental material - the commentary, and in particular the documentary outlining the history of Pixar - are the most valuable aspect of this disc, and almost make up for its very short length overall."Completeists" will want to purchase this disc, but if you are not the sort of fan who must own every scrap of material Pixar ever produced in HD, then I recommend giving this a pass.  Spend your money on something of real value instead.
$SUMMARY.: Non-essential, and too expensive, given the length

$review_text.: Sheena, 1984 filmMen look for a missing girl in a mine in Africa. This girl is adopted by a local tribe as part of a prophecy. [Believable?] Years later she has grown up. [Is that a horse painted to look like a zebra?] In a city two men discuss a mining deal. One king must be removed first. An airplane flies over the land, two men discuss the operation. One of the plotters suffers a heart attack. There is a meting at night. An arrow hit the king in his chest. There is a new king. A reporter wants to interview the arrested woman. An elephant roars, a blonde on a quadruped follows it. The suspect is freed. The new king orders mercenaries to hunt down the shaman. Two photographers drive into the country. Sheena tells them to go back. Animals understand Sheena.Can Sheena protect her tribe against the foreigners who seek to exploit their minerals? Will the usurper get his just desserts? Will the mercenaries eliminate the threat from those reporters? Some animals take part in the action too! Those soldiers continue searching. Sheena and the reporters flee to a safe place. But this village is attacked! In time they are captured by the mercenaries. Can they make a deal over that film? Can Sheena summon help? Can a flock of birds save Sheena? Yes (you've got to see it). Can spears and arrows triumph over machine guns and rifles? Yes (if its in the script). "I was only following orders." Can the new king get away? Can Sheena be saved by Mr. Casey? Will there be a happy ending? What bad things will happen if the outside world learns about that healing earth? Casey and the others return to the outside world. Sheena remains with her tribe.Aside from the implausible and unbelievable parts of this movie, it is a morality play where good people survive and the villains perish. Aside from the setting, this basic story reminds me of some of the Western from the 1930s (people triumph over those who attack them). How different from reality?

$review_text.: Here is a film that enthusiastically supports the negative stereotypes of "theatre people" cherished by hod carriers, gravediggers, truck mechanics, and short order cooks.  It concerns a bottom of the barrel local stage company in post-war Liverpool, which functions as a repository of wretched refuse unable to find work in better venues.  Virtually every despised group is represented; the troupe is teeming with homosexuals, alcoholics, cruel narcissists, manipulative wretches, and those guilty of sex crimes involving minors both male and female.  We do not find people to like in this film, we only find people to pity - like Bunny, portrayed brilliantly by Peter Firth - and Stella, the tragically damaged and clueless protagonist.  Georgina Cates is thoroughly convincing as Stella, yet another young girl who flees a harsh reality for the theatre's comforting deceptions.I was amazed to discover that the trailer for this movie presented it as a comedy - Hamlet is funnier.  Even the illusion of happiness - the theatre's stock and trade - is missing.  What we have instead is a world where people play roles without knowing it, and are emotionally mugged in the process.  The ringleader of this horror show is Meredith Potter; Hugh Grant is exceptionally good.  (This movie was made before Grant found his niche as an affable cad and is certainly his best bit of acting ever.)  Potter is the apogee of upper class English entitlement gone to seed; he is clever, thoroughly decadent, lacking in anything remotely resembling a conscience, and pathetic - though his cruelty makes it impossible for us to scrape together a farthing of empathy, our revulsion prohibits it.The arrival of Alan Rickman - a consistently wonderful actor - as O'Hara, would seems to signal a battle of titans - admirable versus contemptible.  And while watching Rickman play Captain Hook is pure delight, his O'Hara skirts around Potter and drifts off into a somewhat, if not very, bizarre backstory involving Stella's shadowy past.  This derails the film and sends it off in a murky direction since it was never a who-done-it or a psychological thriller.  O'Hara's connection to Stella and her mother may give us an "aha" moment - but ultimately it's a distraction because it doesn't inform what's happened up to that point.  O'Hara has a grim realization that puts him in a very difficult position.  But in the final analysis, Stella is still a girl "abandoned" by her mother and raised by relatives who trades the sadness of real life and for the sadness of fantasy life.Good cinematography, good acting, poor pacing, and sloppy scripting.  Would have been far more interesting to see how a loathsome creature like Potter might create great theatre through the dynamic tension between himself and a range of competing personalities cut from finer cloth.

I think if this movie was split into two parts to tell the story more fully it would have gotten a higher rating from me.  Brad Pitt is great on screen but he just seemed hollow; again due to lack of depth of his character.  Most of the others in the movie were forgotten the minute they left the scene.  I would not buy this film with it is worth a spin if you don't have anything else to do.

$review_text.: The History Channel presents a very good documentary about Sherman's march to the sea, which hastened the end of the Civil War.  It includes archival footage, maps, and the requisite talking heads, but for the most part consists of a very high quality reenactment of the events.  Although he doesn't have many lines of dialogue, Bill Oberst, Jr. makes a sympathetic Sherman, which won't please Southern partisans who still nurse grudges from over a hundred years ago.  This approach results in a program that dispenses information without becoming a dry recitation of facts and even has few moments that are quite moving, something I wasn't expecting from a history documentary.

$REVIEW.: Oh wow

This one just stunned me
I enjoyed the Superman Animated Series but I always felt it was one of the weaker DC animated series

I think that most people would expect that a movie would be of higher quality than the television show but then most people would be incorrect

Brainiac Attacks is sort of a perfect storm of badness that combines horrible voice acting, lousy scripting, sub par animation and a lifeless plot

At the eye of the garbage storm sits the single worst portrayal of Lex Luthor ever in any media


Supposedly the movie takes place in a slightly different universe than the animated series and apparently in this universe Luthor is a worthless buffoon


I've actually never been a huge fan of Clancy Brown's voice acting in the animated series but Powers Boothe's irritating whine made me long for Brown's lower, more dignified vocal tone


Powers Boothe did the voice work for the Ultra Humanite in Justice League Unlimited and seemed fine but here it's just awful

When you combine Luthor's completely inappropriate voice with the terrible dialogue it just becomes painful

Who in there right mind thought that Luthor would say things like, "yadda, yadda, yadda" or "break out the tiki torches" or call Brainiac "Brainy Babe"? Brainiac is also left to suffer

I was always a big fan of Brainiac's voice in the Challenge of the Superfriends with his flat, emotionless tone
 Here they decided to go with a name actor, Lance Hendrikson, and give Brainiac a little more character

After Luthor builds Brainiac a new shell, Brainiac says to Superman, "I've been keeping pace with current trends in technology" uh huh

Also, the three connected dots on his forehead light up one at a time making a sound like a pinball machine stripping away his last shred of dignity.I have to admit that this movie does sometimes reach the level of so bad it's good


My favorite part was after Superman and Lois get blasted with Brainiac's Kryptonite pulse beam and for some strange reason get raccoon eyes


I guess it's supposed to show that the Kryptonite is having an affect on their bodies but for quite a bit of the movie they have raccoon eyes and when Superman changes to Clark he still has the raccoon eyes


I couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous they looked
This is like the worst episode of Superman TAS except triple length

The only way this one could be enjoyed is with copious amounts of alcohol which means it's inappropriate for kids


Do not spend one dime on this.

$REVIEW.: Viewed: 1/13Rate: 91/12: What a great film Hawaii is. While I was watching it, I was thinking of the Columbus' voyage to the New World and how it ruined many cultures of the western hemisphere, introducing disease, imperialism, and eradication. Well, Hawaii is just like that. An added effect to that idea is the usage of missionaries which I found them controversial because of their insistence that Christianity is the, albeit the only, way to live. Max von Syndow does an excellent job of playing the narrow-minded reverend who just can't compromise no matter what. Before the film started, I had my reservations about George Roy Hill who is mostly a one hit wonder through Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (The Sting is a very overrated picture). He actually gets the job done for an epic. Another aspect of Hawaii that left me surprised is the nudity of the natives. Well done, even for 1966 standards. I am glad that Julie Andrews did not steal any scene of the film; she was merely a wallpaper. It's truly the Hawaiians that shine out the most. I would have liked to see more of the background cinematography of Hawaii. All in all, Hawaii is a very intelligently narrated epic picture that couldn't be further from the truth.

$review_text.: The Mothman Prophecies was a major disappointment.  With a good concept, terrific actors, and a proven director, you would think this would be a terrifying film.  It was not terrifying.  Actually, at times it was laughable.Even the claim that it is based on "true events" doesn't make me the least bit scared.  Anytime a movie is based on a true story, you know that things have been fudged to make the movie more interesting.  And sometimes, like in this case, I don't know how they can even consider it to be based on anything, besides an idea.Richard Gere put out a decent performance.  I've definitely seen better by him, and I've seen worse.  Laura Linney was good as the town cop.  And Debra Messing had a small role.  I feel that if her role was more developed and expanded on, the movie would have benefited.Mark Pellington did a terrible job directing it.  It was way over done.  There were too many out-focus-shots.  There were scenes in which needed to be cut out of the movie because they had absolutely nothing to do with it.  They could have chopped off about 10-15 minutes.  I don't understand how he could go from a terrific movie like Arlington Road to this train wreck.The one plus about The Mothman Prophecies is the music.  It's the only thing that kept me interested at all.The Mothman Prophecies will not scare you or intrigue you.  It will only make you wonder why such a good idea was turned into such rubbish.  2 Stars

$review_text.: The vehicle that made Barbra Streisand a major superstar

From Broadway acclaim, to her 1968 Academy Award winning performance, "Funny Girl" is Barbra Streisand


When she sings its most familiar number "People", it seems all time stands still


And to date, there still is no one else who can touch that song but Barbra


As the popular comedic singer/actress Fanny Brice, we're given a lesson of survival through adversity
And Omar Sharif's finest hour since his appearance in "Doctor Zhivago" as Fanny's gambling addicted first husband Nicky Arnstein

You so much want to see these two succeed as a couple; but alas, it just wasn't to be.Another standout is the finale, as Barbra so convincingly sings "My Man" with every award winning emotion imaginable

A note of trivia, Barbra Streisand won her 1968 Best Actress Oscar in a tie with Katherine Hepburn for her grand performance in "The Lion In Winter"


An extreme rarity in Oscar history, having only happened once before back in the 1930s.

$REVIEW.: Rosseta is a disturbing picture
Filmed according the precepts of the cinema verite so in vogue in the sixties, the film accuses a direct influence of Mouchette, a classic film of Robert Bresson.Rosseta is a girl unable to hold in a job steadily, her mother is alcoholic and good for nothing, so Rosseta has to tabe the ride and let behind the used customes of a girl of her age, as a amatter of fact, she cannot establish a rapport with the outer world, she ignores how to dance and the emotional state is very unstable.The nervous camera doesn't leave her alone for a single shot


It runs behind her and nothing else, the dialogues are straight and awful

Her cry of battle is to survive in the hostile world she has to live.A winner film which deserved Cannes in 1999 and for Emile the prize of Best Actress

A genuine masterpiece but if you are not related with Bresson's filmography, you pitifully won't capture the essence of the film.

$REVIEW.: This is not a good comedy, it is a bad one
Let's remember that this bombed when it came out

 There is no story in this movie except a house falling apart, and that is the only gag as well, a lot of ridiculous scenes of parts of the house spontaneously falling apart
 As implausible as this is, it's occasionally mildly funny, unlike any of the dialogue, which is just implausible and not funny
 Tom Hanks is in his forced acting stage, and very plastic

 And Shelly Long, uff, let's not even go there.

$REVIEW.: There were a few (not more than 5) funny, Woody Allen type remarks.  The movie was much too long, repetitious, just chaos around a simple theme.  For once I agree with the Amazon staff reviewer, it wasn't as funny as it should/could have been.  Hell, it wasn't funny at all!  According to the Amazon reviewer, Allen's script was rewritten (let some washroom executive try a stunt like that today!), and that probably accounts for the tedium.  It had a clever (kind of) premise, and probably would have been funny if Allen's script had been left in tact and if it hadn't been nearly 2 hours long.  Peter Sellers was outstanding and delivered the Woody Allen (?) lines with all the perfection they could hold, and of course Allen was funny with his (?) own lines.  Other than that I thought it was a drag.  Sellers shone.

$review_text.: So Sandra Bullock is such a computer geek that no one knows who she really is? If you can swallow that premise then you may be able to enjoy this standard offering from producer irwin Winkler
To be honest the premise of the young woman who has her identity wiped and has to go on the run is fine, if slightly implausible; the overall effect is just not that exciting

Jeremy Northam is suitably slimy as the bad guy and Sandra does a fair scared but fiesty routine

But the film makers don;t seem to be aware that typing on computers is not a thrilling thing to watch

Sandra Bullock running around is, but not when her efforts are not done justice
Overall this ticks off all the required perils but if you've seen The Pelican Brief, then this is pretty much the same thing.

$review_text.: First off, I haven't read the book although I did see it in a bookstore in a bargin bin. Anyway, I made the mistake of judging a film by it's poster. It looks inviting and somewhat entertaining. Clare Danes is a wonderful talent, Jason Schwartzman is oddly watchable, and Steve Martin is a comic vetran. So what's wrong with it? 1. It's ice cold and distant. 2. I could care less for this group of characters. 3. It's not entertaining!To the actor's defense, it's not thier fault. Well, it is Steve Martin's fault. He wrote it and adapted it for the screen. I mean it has a pretty good premise although nothing new but still promising yet in the end you don't care who she ends up with. To me, this film wanted to be this years 'Lost in Translation' but ended up just lost. And for some strange reason it kind of reminded me on P.T. Anderson's 'Punch-Drunk Love' especially the musical score.  It's no Jon Brion and it just doens't work for 'Shopgirl'. It worked for 'Punch-Drunk Love' because the movie was supposed to be strange. Another tiff I had was with Steve Martin alone. I'm sorry, he's a great comic actor but he's trying to pull a Bill Murray over people's heads. It's not working. He's type-cast to me. The role just doesn't suit him at all. To the director's defense, it is gorgeously shot from start to finish. Sadly, that's not enough to fill a film that's too sad and lonely for its own good.

$REVIEW.: A gateway to some Hellish or incomprehensible reality has opened. An initial attempt at investigating wasn't exactly successful. Of those who went, only one returned and he returned a strange man. People built a wall to shield themselves from the unknowable but, and this is not common knowledge, 'the contractors' are now infiltrating our world. It's them and 'the dolls' and something that looks like a cat but talks like a man and it's us who are in big trouble but we don't know it because, except for the very few 'in the know', all who interact with a 'contractor' have their memories erased.Is this Anime at its best? I honestly don't know because I would not call myself an expert or even a fan but I do dig Sci-Fi and I did find the 2 hours worth of 'Darker than Black' worth watching. So did my tween kids who are a more into this than I will ever be.And, since I brought 'kids' into the conversation, yes, there is blood, dismemberment, people being burned or frozen alive but we all live in a violent world that's not getting any gentler so, given where 'the norm' is today, I couldn't say that there is anything truly shocking that would impress or scare any kid above 12. There is no nudity or anything of a sexual nature beyond a kiss and I don't believe there's any smoking, drinking or illegal substance abuse either.This specific DVD release has the first 5 episodes of what appears to be a series and 'Part 2' is already announced. The quality of the picture and sound appear acceptable but not exactly mind-blowing - I am currently watching 'Lost' on DVD and I would call THAT mind-blowing for a DVD. The voices for this release are supplied by English-speaking actors and they are quite good. Interestingly, the English subtitles seem to be coming out from a different translation and you would rarely find one sentence where the spoken English words coincide with the written subtitles. The 2 songs that play at the beginning and at the end of each episode are in Japanese but, following the great Japanese tradition in Rock matters, a couple of the lyrics lines are in English.In brief, I appreciated the opportunity to watch 2 hours to good quality Anime with a rather decent story line - resembling the American 'Heroes' series in many ways. I did not like the fact that this supposedly stand-alone DVD has only 5 episodes of what seems to be a many-episodes series where the fifth episode is 'part one' of a story that spans over 2 or 3 episodes. I understand that 'stuff' has to be marketed but this is not fair marketing, in my view.3 stars is an above-average, positive rating on a scale where 5 stars is exceptional and 4 stars is 'great'. I took away one star for the marketing gimmick that had me watching the last episode and realizing that I may never know how that specific story ended and another for the overall presentation having to do with the functional but not outstanding DVD menu, the rather thin 'extras', the curious discrepancies between the English voices vs. the English subtitles and for the good but not spectacular quality of the picture and sound.Note 1 - the title of this review is lifted from one of the song's lyrics.Note 2 - the copy that I reviewed did not include the 'collectible art box' and I can not judge if the 'box' would justify paying almost twice as much for the option that includes it vs. purchasingDarker Than Black, Vol. 1without the 'box' and saving some money or, you could go for one of the 5-DVD or 6-DVD sets that are currently available at Amazon.

$REVIEW.: I don't read much Amish, I confess, but when I saw this movie coming out, I was intrigued. Directed by Micheal Landon Jr, The Shunning was adapted from Beverly Lewis' bestseller. While I did enjoy the movie, the ending left a lot to be desired. I know the book The Shunning is the first in a three-part series, so I can only conclude (and hope) that they plan to adapt the rest of the books to film.Katie Lapp is the heroine of the movie. She's 20, loves playing the guitar (which is forbidden by The Order), loves to sing (also forbidden), and has her misgivings about her upcoming nuptials to widower John, the new bishop. Danielle Panabaker played a very vivacious and endearing Katie, in my opinion. All the actors in the movie did wonderfully well, though I thought it was kind of humorous to see all the makeup the Amish actors wore. :-P Something tells me the real Katie Lapp wouldn't have gloss on her lips or heavy liner and mascara on her eyes.The history between Katie and Daniel seemed interesting, though in this adaptation it seemed like we got only the tip of the iceberg. The whole movie was very well put together and the peak into what a "shunning" really means for an Amish person was interesting. A very hard, still, and severe punishment, in my opinion. (I would not make a good Amish person! ;-)So while I enjoyed the movie, the ending was really abrupt and left so many unanswered questions. When the credits started rolling, I felt like the actual storyplot was just getting started! Here Katie Lapp was, just found out she was adopted, leaving her family behind to go into the world and discover who she really is....and the movie ends. So, while The Shunning made for an enjoyable family movie, be prepared to want more when the movie ends."Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

$review_text.: This Concert recorded live at the Concert Hall of the KKL Luzern between August 11-15, 2009 employs PCM surround  5.1 Stereo.In other words the sound is great, just like both piano and orchestra are right in your living room.Yuja Wang's performance of the Prokofiev 3rd is electrifying, right up there with Argerich, Kapell and Terence Judd.Her fabulous technique is filled with countless expressive insights, always at the service of the composer, and will reward the listener with new discoveries upon each hearing.I play it every day and each time find something new to marvel at.Abbado's Mahler 1st with the excellent Lucerne Festival Orchestra, catches the magical opening, with its bird like sounds and evocatively distanced brass, with a singular ambience, at least partly related to the orchestra's charachteristic blend of wind timbres.Throughout there is wonderfully warm string playing, and the most atmospheric response from the horns.Especially memorable are the poignancy of the introduction of the Frere Jacques theme in the slow movement and the exultant brilliance of the closing pages, helped by the wide range of dynamic and wonderfully clear PCM surround Stereo sound. Abbado loves this music, and as you watch his face, you can see that he completely identifies with the emotions of every note. Two stunning and unforgettable performances that have been superbly recorded and will probably leave you breathless.

 You'll love Kidder's personality,  off screen,  as she describes some of the acting processes and her interaction with her co-stars

 Brolin does a great job of recounting his early days

 All in all,  a good "edition" of the film to have

 Now,  on to the film:The fact or fiction faction of this film has nothing to do with the film


 Nor should the "truth" about what truly happened should be of no concern to the horror fan.The facts about this film are:1

 Brolin's performance is flawless and riveting.2
 Kidder's performance is genuine and provoking.3


 Steiger's performance deserved an Academy nod.The film begins it's haunting feel from the get-go
 A great job by all involved

 A perfect film for the horror genre

$REVIEW.: This is a classic film! Don't waste your money on the other copy of it. This one has a black cover.There is another copy of it with jaged edges like a chainsaw and the back cover looks like ground beef! That one is very hard to find though. The one on here is the regular new copy. If you are a diehard chainsaw fan you should pick up a copy of that one at a movie speciality store.Both copies have the same load of extras including theatrical trailers for all of the sequals,deleted scenes,comentary and loads more! it is about a group of five teens on a road trip. Their van needs gas so two of them go out in search of a gas station. They stumble upon a house and check it out. You can guess what happens to them. Soon after another teen goes out to look for them and the same horrible fate falls upon him. Later the other two go out in the dark to find them and a character called Leatherface takes one as a prisoner and kills the other one. Leatherface and his trusty chainsaw are like pb and j in this movie. They go together. The teens are killed in creative ways. One dude is bashed on the head with a sledge hammer, one girl is impaled on a meat hook and the rest of them are killed with a chainsaw except the girl. Tobe Hooper did a great job on this one! See Poltergeist, Crocodile, Wrong Turn or The Hills have eyes if you like it.

Nothing to Great, but once it hit theaters it shocked audiences

When I came in to watch it I was blown away with the music choices they had, it set up a great tone for the movie and I must say Insidious is one of the best horror films of 2011 and so on

Most horror films suck these days only a few stand out


Now we have Insidious 2 and when the trailer came out I got so excited I clicked on it and loved it
I can't wait to see it sept 14
I've seen positive reviews and I know it will be great

James Wan never disappoints


The plot to the second film is more of supernatural mystery film

$REVIEW.: Frank Martin returns in a situation he would never choose to be in, acting as a driver and body guard (more or less) for a little rich boy.I don't mind the lame premise of the movie as I can appreciate mindless action flicks as a diversion
But there wasn't enough plot to keep me really interested, and the movie couldn't decide if it was James Bond pushing the technical envelope, or a Kung Fu movie where the moves are a bit magical (and less than plausible).The acting was bland and the directing poor


It felt like an number of scenes were shot and chopped together to make a film


It is never really made clear why the evil one's patrons want all those people dead, and how the virus would really work.Using well worn cliche characters didn't help either: a beautiful tough woman wielding heavy weapons with not a soft spot in her heart or the tall, dark, handsome evil assasin.An OK diversion, but not good cinema.

$REVIEW.: Eloge De L'Amour is Godard's tribute to love and the passing of love marinated in History


The b/w 35mm first hour shot like documentary, is Paris now, where Edgar the director wants to realize a project :play,novel,opera,film,he doesn't know which, treating the 4 seasons of a love story:meeting,physical passion,separation,reunion, witnessed through 3 couples,young,adult and old age representing 3 generations.This Paris is strangely reminiscent of the Paris of the nouveau vague,rainy streets,lights glistening in shadows and reflections,interiors with illumination from distant light sources.We get paintings bought back from museums which the Nazis stole from the Jews,we also get editions of Balzac and George Bataille,writing on the Spanish Civil War.There are images of the homeless.Edgar seeks a young woman Elle (Camp) he hopes to cast, who now works as a cleaner.He likes the tone of her voice,it generates ideas.He later remembers her from an interview he had with her grandparents,in Brittany, who fought in the Resistance and survived the holocaust


Their memories were being bought by Spielberg Associates, Americans,who not having their own stories,buy other people's

Godard uses his characters in a polemical rant against why `American'  means no name,stealing the soul of everybody else,[Late] capitalism destroying with greed at the end of History.No films, no love,no History,no memory.The 2nd half of the film is shot in DV saturated colour 2 years before, as if we are looking through memory or imagination.The colour following the b/w 1st part is the opposite to what one would expect.as colour postdates b/w in film chronology.It could be of the future.Eloge reveals Godard's obsessions:cinema,art,literature,memory,history.The b/w film has a timeless quality, static,composed,long exposure,mysterious,voices off camera speaking to voices on,or talking over other voices.The girl quotes Bresson in the 2nd part ,the bodies are shot from behind as they speak as would Bresson.Edgar wants to write a cantata to Simone Weil,who thought the Bible was not a theory of God,but of man.History has been replaced by technology,politics by religion.The antithesis of love is the state..We get images of the holocaust or a talk on Kosovo.Fans look at posters of Bresson's Pickpocket next to posters of The Matrix.Later fans want The Matrix dubbed into Bretton.Edgar seeks to become adult.The film is difficult to grasp on a first view,but its visual command can astonish and his seductive gloom,together with a soundtrack of trains,traffic noises,voices,piano linking images
The quotes of philosophers,poets(Villon),painters(Picasso).Images from the deepest recesses of shadow stay in one's subconscious leavened by the narrator's voiceover or unfinished dialogue.Godard does not make movies,nor entertainment, it is the treatment of the themes of Godard's lifetime.A cinematic philosopher ruminating on age,memory, history, resistance,society,culture and existence,by way of mourning the passing of love

At age 71 he's reflecting on life,from old age,on memory and history as a way to reclaim our lives,diluted if not stolen by modern society and capitalism.As he says in the film,"there is no resistance without history".The passion.

$REVIEW.: I finally sat down and watched this DVD - I have no idea why I waited so long, I'm a Johnny Depp fan and love the way he lives and breaths his characters.  He is especially believable as Jack Sparrow - lovable despite his tendency to think predominantly of his own well-being or how to line his pockets.A good bit of time has passed since the previous movie and the East India Trade company has moved into the area; bringing with it the detestable Lord Beckett, who has Will arrested on his wedding day and drags him to the site - where Elizabeth forlornly sits in the rain, in her wedding dress - in chains.  And proceeds to arrest Elizabeth as well.  What does he want?  He wants Jack Sparrow's compass and he's willing to make a deal to get it - he will send Will out to find Sparrow and get the compass in exchange for a pardon for Sparrow and leniency for Will and Elizabeth.The movie has amazing special effects - like the first movie, the crew of the antagonistic ship is completely crewed by "monsters," requiring extensive special effects.  Personally, I liked the special effects in this movie better - I was fascinated by the constant movement on many of the characters.  The kraken was also pretty cool, especially toward the end where you get to see the main body and mouth of the "beastie," as Jack puts it.This movie does end on a bit of a cliff-hanger, with a bit of a surprise thrown at us right at the end that I certainly didn't see coming.  I will definitely be looking forward to watching "At World's End" once it is released to DVD.  A recommend from me for anyone who enjoys a good adventure flick, some fun sword fights (love the water-mill scene - shades of a hamster wheel, anyone??) and terrific special effects.  Not for the people who prefer to be intellectually challenged or go to "theatres" to see "films" - this is definitely a movie ;-)  Get it, watch it, enjoy it!

$REVIEW.: I loved it.  I saw it a year or so ago, loved it then, bought a copy and just finished watching it a 2nd time.  I think it's one of the cleverest comedies I can remember seeing.  It is as the acerbic virulent reviewer below me said predictable.  In this case, so what.  And what else could you expect from the plot (that he didn't already divulge) given the characters and the situation?  I would love to know how much Billy Crystal did on the script, I didn't know he was a witty person.  And I never liked him before this movie, but I thought he was droll and subtle and perfect in this movie.  One glitch.  What would Eddie have ever seen in Gwenn?  That one was a little hard to swallow.  Sigh.  But no matter.  And (rare for a comedy these days or any days), it was actually witty.  It was funny.  It made me laugh out loud.  All the actors were in top form.  The situations and conversations the writers devised for them were original and I thought hysterical.  I highly recommend this comedy to anyone who thinks he might like it.

$REVIEW.: I just finished blasting the House DVD set for its poor presentation of a great series, and Lost came in the mail.  I was really impressed not only by the 5.1 sound, but the mixing as well.  In CSI, for example, the sound is 5.1, but there is little benefit to it.  Here, the mixing is wondeful, and if you want proof, just listen to the first time the thing in the forest starts roaring and moving trees!  Furthermore, this one is in beautiful anamorphic widescreen.  The care in production is on a par with the Star Trek DVD's, but at a far lower price.  If I must register a complaint, it is in the package itself.  What is with this new thing where each disk is staggered over another?  If you want disk 2, you have to remove disk 1 to get at it, and so forth.  Nevertheless, this is a must buy.  I hope other producers look to this as a gold standard for DVD sets.

$REVIEW.: We ordered Chained on a Lark and found it as compelling a film as it is dark and disturbing. The story centers around a serial killer played beautifully by Vincent D' Onofrio who has become a multi faceted and extraordinary actor. He abducts a young boy whom he keeps chained for quite some time prior to releasing him and giving him run of the house.But things aren't that easy - The young boy named 'Rabbit' does what he can to survive and the performance by Eamon Farron is both fearless and heart wrenching as Rabbit is quite extraordinary and as most of the action takes place inthe house the scenes between the two leads are haunting to say the least. Not a &#34;Happy Movie&#34; nor thriller - Chained probes deeper than most into the horror of a broken mind.Chained is not  a&#34;pretty strory&#34; but it sure is compelling.

$review_text.: The worst part of movies dealing with war or soldiers during a specific time period is that they often feel like recruitment videos. Either that or they shove patriotism down your throat. "Memorial Day" isn't like that at all, which is a relief. What really balances out the entire movie is the time Kyle spends with his grandfather. James Cromwell's heartfelt performance is really fantastic. His emotion gives much needed heart to a story like this. The thing about grandfathers is that they're supposed to always have a story to tell and have words of wisdom. Bud is the epitome of that, but he waits to reveal that until somebody makes him talk.The time Kyle and Bud spend together inspires Kyle to start a collection of his own once he becomes a soldier as an adult and has a family of his own. This is the other big intriguing aspect of the war drama. Seeing Kyle collect things throughout the movie only makes you realize what he's eventually going to tell his son one day, which is kind of heartwarming. The last five minutes of the movie are also its bread and butter. It's as if the entire movie was written to give those few scenes more impact and it works so well. It's just a series of really passionate performances along with perhaps the most memorable scene to take place on that porch in the entire movie.Many of the other performances feel uninspired. Maybe it's just the way Hollywood writes soldiers, but most of them are pretty forgettable here other than Kyle. John Cromwell is pretty exceptional in his full length feature film debut though. Everyone else outside of the main cast just feels like filler. Ho-hum is an acceptable way to describe the majority of the movie as things like the score, battlefield sequences, and lines of dialogue will be a distant memory at best. Although roaming shots of the countryside are extremely colorful on the Blu-ray edition of the movie."Memorial Day" is mostly watchable thanks to the performances of John and James Cromwell. The story does its best to reel you in and feel for these characters, but may feel like it's stringing you along with no pay off in sight at times. There are certainly worse war related movies you could spend your hard earned money on.Special features include Audio Commentary with Director Sam Fischer, Writer Marc Conklin, and Actor John Cromwell and a less than two minute Behind the Scenes featurette."Memorial Day" is being released as a single disc DVD and a single disc Blu-ray starting tomorrow, May 29. The movie is not rated, is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio in 1080p High-Definition and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. It is approximately 104 minutes in length. "Memorial Day" will be available in most retail outlets and online stores.

$review_text.: The Omen follows a woman named Katherine Thorn (Julia Stiles) who delivers a stillborn child.  Her husband Robert (Liev Schreiber) knows this, and without consulting her first, switches the stillborn with another baby.  They name the child Damien (as in demon).  At Damien's (4th) birthday [party], their nanny commits suicide by hanging herself by the house, saying aloud it's "all for you [Damien]"  After that incident, another woman is `hired' to be the new nanny.  I didn't like this nanny, and I think she was really the bad one, instead of Damien.  Anyways, one day all three of them (mom, dad, and Damien) are on their way to church.  Approaching the church, Damien gets nervous and feverish.  When they arrive at the church, Damien throws a big fit.  Okay, if I was there, I'd think something was really messed up with my child, and I would have him checked out by a doctor as soon as possible!!  Another incident is when Katherine takes Damien and a bunch of other kids to the zoo.  Damien goes to see the monkeys by himself, while the other kids go in separate directions.  The monkeys notice Damien and are afraid.  The big gorilla suddenly tries to break through the glass (I guess to try and kill Damien).  After that unpleasant incident, Katherine thinks there is something really wrong with her son.  She sees a therapist for this.  When Katherine falls from the top floor of her house, she winds up in the hospital.  She isn't dead, but she's badly injured.  When she `mysteriously' dies one day, and Robert finds out, he takes immediate action.  It's up to him now to kill his son, otherwise who knows who else will die.This is an exact replica of the original!  I don't remember, though, that ugly-faced guy Robert was questioning, to be in the original.

$review_text.: This dvd in my mind is not as exciting as the other dvds, yet it still sheds some light on certain characters.In the first episode, we learn about Misato and her past
There is also an extremely cool scene in which the evas must stop an angel coming to earth
I think one of the more interesting scenes of the series is when the three kids are sitting on a cliff watching the sky without the illuminated city
The creator must of thought about this scene for a while, as it is perfect.The second episode talks about Ritsuko alot

The magi are introduced, yet they aren't really made to seem that important later in the series.The final episode is not particularly interesting to begin with because it is a recap of things you will have already seen


The end of the episode talks about Rei a little bit, and that is important for later.If you loved the first three dvds, my review isn't going to stop you from buying this one


If you haven't seen the series yet, do yourself a favor and watch the entire series
I have talked to some people who didn't like the first dvd or saw a few episodes in the middle


Once you watch them all, you can truly appreciate the series.

total dud!  This may have been the worst edited movie I have ever seen, and it could have been so great

 I can't imagine an extended edition, when the original version was an hour and a half too long

 The acting is brilliant, even if Jeff Daniels let himself go, making it hard to believe this one takes place before Gettysburg
 Gettysburg was a triumph, and this one could have been, but the editor ruined the movie.

As someone what they remember about Rockford, and it'll be the scams and Jim's fights for lost causes.  Those elements were in the first two seasons, but in season three they really "click".Watching the episodes on DVD now, it's interesting to see how many actors were used over and over again, but in different roles each time.  Almost like an acting troop where the same people do all the parts--but not quite!Can't wait to get season 4!

$REVIEW.: I had watched a few episodes of this series when it was originally broadcast on the Court TV channel and agree with the other folks that Gale states THE OBVIOUS.Frankly, if the police detectives working for me on my squad couldn't surmise the stuff she comes up with, I would let them go in the first place.  The only cases I found her so called "profiling" at all effective in the ongoing investigation was the one about the two young girls who murdered the nude guy in his bedroom [duh!], and the son who was suspected of killing his mother until someone told Gale mom was raped during the murder.  C'mon.....this is CSI 101 for boneheads!!!!At least I got a few chuckles from observing the physical conditioning of a typical Florida cop.  With all their girth, I would be surprised any of these guys could even run a 100, let alone do it fast enough to catch a fleeing killer.My "profile" for Florida law enforcement in general.....FAT, FAT, FAT!  hahahahahaPerhaps it is a good idea that Gale is around as it seems almost all the suspects are either ratted out by friends or girlfriends, or actually turn themselves in.  None of these fat guys would ever have the nerve to claim "solving the case", so Gale might as well do it.The pretense of these shows is misrepresented in the first place.  FBI profiler, John Douglas, who perfected this craft had always stated that a profiler was never there to solve the cases.  Rather they are there to provide or discount possible suspects.Gale only did that in two of these episodes.  Back to Quantico for a refresher course,  Dear...............

$REVIEW.: I was born and raised in England and have watched Doctor Who ever since the first episode in 1963.  When Doctor Who was &#34;re-launched&#34; with Christopher Eccleston, I was glued to every episode just as I was as a child when it was originally launched.  Probably even more so since techology and special effects have come such a long way since 1963.  I love the way Doctor Who has remained true to his character regardless of which actor is playing him.  I also love the way that storylines and aliens from the past are woven into the present.  And, more importantly, I love how this has remained a family show.  Matt Smith is the youngest actor to every play Doctor Who and he has done a brilliant job!!  I'm sad to see him go, but I know Peter Capaldi is a great actor and I'm sure he will carry the &#34;Doctor Who Torch&#34; very capably.

$review_text.: A beautifully well constructed movie. From the very beginning, the destiny of Cinderella and the prince is sealed. When one of her friends servant asks her what she would like to have back from town, she simply answers: "Just bring me the first thing that will fall on your nose." (phrase actually taken from the brothers Grimms'tale.) And so it does happen, with the help of the prince, though, who, wanting to make a joke on the servant, shoots an arrow targetting a nest on a tree branch. He doesn't miss (for something he's the prince) and the nest falls on the servant's head. He finds inside three chestnuts on a twig. Three chestnuts because, as the original title says: "Three Chestnuts for Cinderella." Each contains what will make Cinderella happy, closing the loop perfectly. Libuse Safrankova is absolutely cute and wonderful in her role, performed with talent. Pavel Travnicek, who plays the prince isn't that good, but his awsome outfits hide a bit his lack of talent. The stepmother is "awfully perfect", and even funny when she wears that unbelievable umbrella hat with ridiculous dignity.My five year old son watches this movie since he's three and never stopped loving it, although he's now used to 3D animation movies such as those from Disney-Pixar and Dreamworks. "Three Wishes for Cinderella" is definitely special, beautiful and perfect. Don't miss it.For an extra information, the German version ("Drei Haseln&uuml;sse f&uuml;r Aschenbr&ouml;del") has been digitally remastered. Not the yellow box version, but the one which presents Cinderella and the Prince on the cover, with a blue label: "DIGITAL &uuml;berarbeitete FASSUNG" (digitally remastered). The entire movie has been cleaned of all its scratches, the colour enhanced, thus recovering its original aspect of the 1974 release. The audio has not been forgotten as it now offers a new digital AC3 (2 channels) quality. Available also on Amazon, but from Germany. That means: for zone 2 (or region free) players only.

$REVIEW.: Okay, let's see... one of the reviewers wants their horror movies with "blood, gore, action and violence". Okay, let's break that down. First, let's put blood and gore together - blood is the liquid stuff inside people and other animals and gore is guts & stuff. If that's what a horror movie is then all war movies, most gangster movies, many westerns, and any halfway realistic medical drama qualifies as "horror". If you're anything like me then you're not so much "horrorfied" at blood and gore. I mean, the standard response to that should be "yuck!" not fear. Now what about action and violence, those two go together, right? Well, right there you have me again. Isn't there a whole genre of movie  (and fiction in general) known as "action"? What's so horrofying about "action"? In fact, if you put too much action in a horror movie it moves too fast and you have no time for fear or horror or any other horror-related response. Just think of that remake of Dawn of the Dead. The zombies ran around so fast all the time it didn't really matter that they were zombies. I mean, what the hell is so horrorfying about that?! Sure, maybe you won't get bored, but "not being bored" isn't really what horror is for, is it? And as for violence, well that's just destructive action directed at living creatures, particularly people. Well, now THAT is pretty horrorfying, but once you bring in a horror element, say like a zombie or a vampire or some monster or whatever, well, you've stepped off into fantasy and forgive me, but I'm not really scared by things that don't exist, so no ammount of violence will convince me that anything is a good horror movie. That pretty much leaves violence perpetrated by insane, devious, or supposedly "evil" human beings. That means that the only truly decent horror movies, provided you look for your horror films to have "blood, gore, action and violence," is a mad killer movie with no supernatural element to be disbelieved, an ultra realistic depiction of people killing and maiming each other. You're right that DOES sound really horrible! Add to that the fact that when you get such over the top action and violence and gore you tend to lose your sense of belief because you know it isn't true, isn't really happening so, like so many horror fans, you become really just a fan of fake movie carnage and watch your beloved (fake) "horror movies" like a sports fan, yelling at the screen, cheering on the carnage, never really taking time to become horrorfied or scared in any way. Well, I'm sorry, but if that's horror you can keep it! Movies like Devil's Backbone may seem more dramatic than horrorific when compared to a zombie movie, but for my money it's closer to horror than most "blood, gore, action & violence" fests masquerading as horror and providing mere frat boy thrill ride chills than anything resembling horror or fear. It still all comes down to story and taking time to bring about a suspension of disbelief and drawing the viewer into a state of tracelike horror and fear. If you like this sort of thing, this movie may stick with you. If not, that's fine, too.

$review_text.: Moving into its Fourth Season, MI-5 retains its seemingly impossible-to-achieve status as one of the smartest, most intelligent, and most dramatic shows you'll ever see. "MI-5" is about a group of British citizen individuals who join "5" to help "defend the realm." (MI-5 is that branch of the British secret service that is focused on domestic threats, be they economic, terrorist, civil uprisings, or any externally originating threat that has found its way back to the UK; a sister branch, MI-6, not a part of this show, deals more exclusively with external threats to the country.) The series introduces us to all kinds of real-world threats--both potential and operationally real--and shows how the members of 5 must react in order to counter and/or eliminate these threats. The series is so well written, produced, directed, filmed, and acted that each episode is more of a 60-minute movie than a television episode. The drama, intrigue, intelligent stories, and, yes, action, establish the series as a standout among even the often high-achieving BBC (already the producer of many world-class shows), making it with little doubt one of the best shows of this nature ever made.Season Four again focuses on a new series of threats to the UK, and, perhaps more than any other season to date, has a "thematic" flavor that carries through the entire season. And although it seems increasingly impossible that the show could ever match the emotional excitement and achievement of each last season, Season Four raises the bar once again and seems to defy all "regression to the mean." I liken the show to one of those plate twirlers who gets a plate spinning up in the air at the top of one of those skinny sticks, and while you are trying to understand how he is doing it, starts another plate stirring on a second stick while keeping the first going. And then, to your incredulity, he adds yet a third plate on a third stick, and now maintains all three plates. You scratch your head with amazement even as you watch him keep all three plates twirling on those sticks, and yet he does it right in front of you. That's what MI-5 is like as you enter the third and fourth seasons.Because of the complexity and the intellectual development of characters (as well as the plots themselves), it is best to watch MI-5 in order by episode, with no skipping of episodes, and this makes the DVD release of the show perhaps the very best manner in which to view the production. The DVDs allow you to step your way through each season, episode by episode, thereby viewing the show in the manner in which it was intended to be viewed. This gives you the ability to watch how characters are developed, and to better gain an understanding of how the MI-5 Section D group works. With the exception of the very first episode of Season One (the first episode is really not up to the standards of all the remaining ones, an issue attributable to the difficulties inherent in plot development) the shows are incredibly exciting, but also intelligently written in a way that will make you re-think the issues surrounding the role of the security forces in countries, what actions should and should not be allowed, the best way to address classes of threats, the implications for a free society when eliminating threats, the intersection of political and security concerns, and much more. You might at first glace think that MI-5, as an entertainment production, would be no more than that; but MI-5 is certainly more than a simple entertainment show. Be prepared to be entertained, but also mentally stimulated.This is a truly amazing show. It's easily seven stars out of five. And the prices of the discs have come down dramatically from earlier years. But don't forget: you need to watch these IN ORDER. If you haven't seen it yet, start with Season One, work your way through that first not-so-good episode, and then watch the thing take of a like a jet. You'll be hooked by the time you get to the end of Season One.The Seasons:MI-5, Volume 1MI-5, Volume 2MI-5, Volume 3MI-5, Volume 4MI-5: Volume 5MI-5, Volume 6MI-5, Volume 7MI-5: Volume 8Mi-5: Volume 9Volume 10 not yet released (Dec 2011)

$review_text.: Imagine if Kubrick's &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was made with late-'90's technology and a Hollywood cast, by -- for better or for worse -- the Spielberg disciple who directed &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.  You don't have to imagine it, because we have the reality of &quot;Contact&quot;.  I had a lot of problems with this movie, some of which I'll list later, but overall I enjoyed it a lot.The science of the movie was fascinating (even though I'm not familiar with the source material, the late Carl Sagan probably deserves much credit here).  A rag-tag group of science misfits picks up a pulse from outer space, and slowly learns the message contained within.  There's a fine moment near the end of this sequence where a video representation of the message is revealed, and it is a truly stunning moment, that carries much drama.  The message contains plans to build a machine, which will send one person to a distant star, presumably for enlightenment.  The &quot;machine&quot; is gloriously realized.  It is both beautiful and believable, its power palpable and awesome (especially in one scene where things go horribly wrong).  Director Robert Zemeckis uses his considerable skill at special effects very wisely here, giving us enough to keep the imagination entertained but never overwhelming the story.Unfortunately, the less technical aspects of the movie are handled quite sloppily.First, the acting.  James Woods and John Hurt, two actors I admire, had a tough time fleshing out their two-dimensional characters.  Woods didn't do anything more than show narrow-mindedness and anger, while Hurt was stuck in eccentric billionaire mode.  Rob Lowe, also playing a two-dimensional character, was just painful to watch, affecting a hoarse voice and a beatific smile that did little to hide the fact that his character was no more than a fluffy device to introduce basic religious arguments.  Ditto Jake Busey, as an over the top zealot who carried the added detriment of an albino fright wig and &quot;evil&quot; white-eyes.  Tom Skerritt fared better, although he was miscast.  Skerritt is usually fine when playing the saintly father figure; here he's asked to be a slick, egotistical bureaucrat, and doesn't pull it off.  Which brings us to Matthew McConaughey.  I had no problem with his acting, but the character was completely implausible.  A man with a self-help book at number one on the bestseller list would not get this much time with the President, especially if his ideas were as lame as Matt's 'Palmer Joss'.  He represents a bigger problem with the movie, in that the fight between science and religion is handled in a very passionate, but utterly simple-minded way.  I suspect that some of the book's big ideas and arguments were dumbed down for a mass audience.  It's unfortunate, wasting an opportunity for intelligent mass discourse.The lone bright spot in the cast is -- duh -- Jodie Foster.  I admit to being ambivalent about Foster in the past, but here she won me over.  Her Dr. Arroway is meant to have passion, drive, brains, desire, spunk, and innocence.  Foster pulls off all of these traits wonderfully.  There were some moments near the end, when Arroway takes flight (&quot;They should have sent a poet,&quot; she cries when confronted by an ineffable view of space), that in the hands of a lesser actor would be hokey.  Foster gets them all right.I get the impression that Zemeckis himself doesn't trust the weight of the ideas he's putting forth here, because he does several things that distract the audience from them.  First, the relationship between a young Arroway and her father was manipulation of the highest order.  It's pop psychology that anyone can understand on an emotional level, rather than the intellectual level, which should have been the movie's strength.  Also, he employs &quot;testimony&quot; from real-world media figures (it seemed like the entire staff of CNN appeared on screen at one point or another) to lend the ideas credibility.  In fact, the ideas were undermined because of this.  The same can be said for his liberal use of news footage of President Clinton, whose intentionally vague speeches are supposed to relate to the film's narrative, but rather prove distracting.There is a lot of potential in &quot;Contact&quot;.  I was gripped by the story, even though a lot of the times I felt like a machete-wielding explorer hacking my way through a jungle of debris to get to it (I have the sneaking suspicion that Zemeckis realizes this, for he includes a take-off of the line &quot;Dr. Livingstone, I presume&quot;).  It is visually stunning, engrossing, and, if you can turn off your cynicism for awhile, believable.
$SUMMARY.: There's a fine movie in here somewhere

I got this set, in a very timely manner, and I watched them

I then re-bought it a year later and now it holds its place in my record collection (you know the black round things) with my other stuff. I haven't played it for years, and I mean YEARS !!!! So I then bought Manilow Live on DVD,.....[....] Anyway I got my package, and along with a whole lot of other stuff, was .....Mr Manilow.I have never sung so loudly in all my life. I knew every word!!! EVERY WORD!!! To all the songs, well the main ones anyway.  I loved it. Totally loved it!! And his voice matches mine perfectly or something like that. The neighbours admittedly look at me differently 'cause the walls aren't as thick as I thought, but I've played it everyday since I got it. Its true, you can ask my neighbours!!  - loudly everyday!!!  Its truly brilliant and very very enjoyable.  Just wanted you to know. Cheers.

It seemed more funny and pointless,but as I got older and re watched it and WATCHED THE INTERVIEWS!!!!!! which most people don't and understand why tobe hooper made the film he did. The film is great if you like dark humor and understand the whole back story of what happened after the first one. Only thing that has me wondering is the end of the movie when caroline williams is at the top swinging the chainsaw what happens to her? However CHOP TOP IS NOT DEAD. Go to google search and look for chop top there is suppose to be a movie coming out some day about how chop top didn't die at the end. As far as the movie goes if you pay close attention part 1 and 2 connect ,but the rest of the series is dead.

$review_text.: If you're looking for a great action packed adventure with lots of shooting and phenomenal car chases you need look no further, this is it!The title Ronin, according to the booklet that accompanies the DVD, is from Japanese legends and described a disgraced Samurai warrior who had allowed their master to be slain and was forced to wander the land looking for work

After the cold war was essentially over, covert agents had to look for employment elsewhere as mercenaries.When a special job required the assembly of a team of crack mercenaries a group was brought together for a one-time job that turned out to challenge even their special skills at mayhem and carnage


This movie picks the viewer up and carries them along on a thrill ride that doesn't stop.The cast features Robert De Niro heading a number of very familiar actors whose names may not be all that familiar to the average viewer


The result is an intense action film that is completely involving to those who enjoy action films

I've viewed it many times and enjoy it all over every single time.Directed by John Frankenheimer, the film used a stark camera effect, much of which was shot "with a Steadicam hand-held Camera, giving Ronin a realistic documentary look." The film was shot in France in a number of well known locations and "the climactic finale was filmed in Paris' Zenith arena, where nearly 2,000 extras were used in the chaotic sequence."This is one terrific action film that will stand repeated viewings
If you enjoy the genre you'll definitely want to add this one to your collection.

$REVIEW.: I watched this one in the company of two experts, a pair of 9-year-old boys determined to one-up each other in their knowledge of Lemony Snicket minutiae.They pointed out that the movie "got it all wrong," being a pastiche of out-of-order fragments from the first three unfortunate volumes
In fact, half their pleasure seemed to be in finding new errata


I won't argue - enjoyment of any kind is real enough enjoyment

On the whole, my consultants came away from the movie happy enough, but mostly happy with their own superiority in the lore of Lemony Snicket.I had only read (and not much enjoyed) the first book


I didn't think the movie-makers handled the book all that much more roughly than most scriptwriters handle most books


I found the effects generally good, and especially enjoyed Aunt Jo's lakeshore cottage, as would anyone who's survived a DIY renovation.Jim Carrey's mugging was a bit over the top, but about what I expected from Carrey and for Count Olaf

Sunny was a much more effective character in the movie than in the book, with more personality and a more positive role


Klaus and Violet were competently cast and acted

Violet, supposedly a fourteen year old girl, seemed like a junior Angelina Jolie with bee-stung lips and gothic tendency towards black fishnet
I came away unsure how she was being presented, and not sure that I wanted to know.I found the movie less than ordinary, arch goofiness without enough substance or effects to justify the movie as a whole
I'm not in the target demographic, however, and my companion film-goers were


They had a great time, so my four-star rating owes a lot more to their opinion than to my own.//wiredweird

$review_text.: This review is for &#34;My Tale Is Hot&#34; only:I wasn't really sure what to expect from this outing, because you never know what you are going to get when you watch one of these skin-flicks from the 60's, as the quality of them tends to run all over the place. But &#34;My Tale Is Hot&#34; is, if not a solid effort, at least stays on the right side of entertaining.There's really not much to this film, as it's basically a string of burlesque-type shots of fairly attractive babes, which has a bookended plot about a super-faithful husband (played by Jack Little, under the name &#34;Little Jack Little&#34;) being tempted by the devil (played by Max Gardens, under the name &#34;Manny Goodtimes&#34;) to stray. That's about it.Deeply involving this is not, but it is a good bit of fun and never really takes itself very seriously. As noted, the women are remarkably pretty attractive for the most part and have little problem peeling for the camera, while Little and Gardens provide somewhat humorous double entendre commentary during it. There's even a clever &#34;little twist&#34; (no pun intended) in the end, when the devil learns just why he can't tempt this most faithful husband to cheat. The dialogue is totally cornball throughout, with puns-a-plenty, some of it funny and some of it cringe-worthy.Really, though, the film is pretty much centered on the buxom figures of the ladies, which is only to be expected. There is a nice go-go dancing scene about midway through, featuring the talents of Ms. Candy Barr which is very nice. At just under an hour long, the film doesn't tend to overstay it's welcome, even if a couple of the burlesque scenes do seem to.In the end, it's just a fun and campy nudie-cutie romp, which is pretty indicative of this brand of film. It is certainly far from the worst effort this kind of film-making has created. If you are a fan of the genre, you might get a few chuckles of mileage out of this one.

$review_text.: Being a long time fan of John Wagner's Judge Dredd comic, I came into this movie with little to no expectations.  Comic book fans have been forced into a sort of prolonged cynicism in regards to movie adaptations.  So many poor movie makers, like Chris Nolan and his ilk have been granted access to these properties with little to no oversight or knowledge until now, comic movies are by and large purely trash.  This movie is an exception.  I took away the feeling that the makers of this movie were actually fans and somewhat knowledgeable of the very things that make comic books enjoyable and vital.Not to say that this is an accurate depiction of an actual comic book.  In all fairness though, I don't see how a movie could be.  It is like the difference between Star Wars and a Moebius comic.  The movies were visually styled after his artwork but really look nothing like it.  So instead the makers gave us the "feel" of Judge Dredd.  The style in which they worked is very John Carpenter and it is a perfect fit.  Recreating this in a digital format is in itself quite an accomplishment.  Their ability to mimic the look of 1970's-80's Carpenter action movies within a brand new filming technique is a great sign for all filmmakers.  The technology seems to work well.Karl Urban does a fantastic job of portraying Joe Dredd.  He adeptly captured the stoicism of the character with simple lines and excellent physical acting.  Urban has become known for this ability throughout his career and was an excellent casting.Fans of the comic will be pleased with this.

$REVIEW.: Last summer, a business associate, Dave Fitzgerald of DCF Concerts in Oklahoma City, who regionally promotes over 200 shows a year told me the Sheryl Crow concert he witnessed at the Smirnoff Theatre in Dallas ranked among the top 5 shows he ever saw. Pretty impressive coming from a promoter whose been involved with well over 1000 shows.After seeing &quot;C'mon America&quot; I can see why.From the opening &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; Sheryl proves why she is a big-time headliner.The sound quality is not quite DTS, but is more than sufficient to entertain. This one is no comparison to &quot;Rockin The Globe&quot;. Sheryl takes her already great voice and music up a notch. Watching &quot;I Shall Believe&quot; reminded me of why I got into her music in the first place ... watching her closing cover of Zeppelin's &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; shows just how far she has come.This easily ranks among the Eagles &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; and U2's &quot;Come Home&quot; as the best rock concert DVD's available.If you're a Sheryl fan, this one's much much better than the &quot;Globe&quot; DVD and is worth getting along with &quot;Live at Budokan&quot;. I might add ... its nice they finally caught a live performance of Sheryl where the crowd is totally into it.

$review_text.: I missed this when it was on air in the 90's, and found it cheap at Best Buy recently and picked it up.  The story gets rolling right off the bat as a civilian science astronaut gets cut from his mission and then joins the US Marine Corp to get into space and look for his girlfriend who was not cut from civilian mission.  I thought that was a good way to set up the whole series: 2 lovers separated in space.  The rest you'll have to watch, but I'll tell you there is a major space war going on.The best thing about this show is the characters.  The sets all look good, fairly believable, with interiors looking more like naval ships than Star Trek's Enterprise.  The special effects are decent.  The only problem I had is that a couple episodes seemed slow paced and more like filler.  But overall very enjoyable, especially if you don't want your space squeeky clean like Star Trek, and if you think Marine corp uniforms look better than Star Trek ballerina costumesEDIT TO ORIGINAL REVIEW: I took off one star as I am re-watching some episodes and I notice that about 2/3 through the series it seems to really change gears.  The writing and stories get very predictable, the main character seems to becoming a little whiney brat, no one follows direct orders in combat, combat/action scenes are boring and go no where. Somewhere this series got off track and wanders aimlessly for much of the last episodes.

To be honest, I didn't want to see it.  After all, it starred that guy from Flash Gordon!  Well, at my wife's insistence, I watched the opening sequence (the song &quot;Tradition&quot;) and I was hooked.  Such life!  Such humor!Later, as a gift, I bought my wife the DVD that we've played again and again.  The transfer is wonderful; the sound is clear and deep.  This DVD is a must for any collector of fine cinema, or musical theatre.Oh, and as for &quot;that guy from Flash Gordon&quot;, Topol gives the definitive performance of Tevye.

$review_text.: ill start off with the main reason 99% of us have had so much curiousity in this movie. Heath Ledger as the joker. and what can be said? the man was amazing. he is THE Joker. this role solidifies his stance as one of todays best young actors, if not the best. his death truly was a tragedy. when watching this movie, you may forget thats Heath Ledger behind all the make up, he is so into character its not even funny.Christain Bale, Morgan Freeman, and everyone else were as solid as possible. Maggie Gyllenhall was a massive improvement over Katie Holmes as well. If only Spider Man 3 could've followed this example in story telling. this movie managed to balance so many elements and still be completely tangable. you see it all, from a brief appearance of the scarecrow, to the perfectly maniacal Heath Ledger as the joker, even the downfall of Harvey Dent and some major surprises i shouldnt even mention.this is a whole new bat man, a much darker, down to earth series than we've seen before. well, as down to earth as a movie about a bat-suited anti-hero can be. it takes the darkness of Batman Begins to a new level. there is still a total lack of super powers for the villains, but they have their own means of trouble. The Joker can take batmans greatest power, Fear, which is crippling for most men, and laugh in his face.the acting, camera work, effects, and story are all beyond superb, and worthy of many viewings. ive already seen it twice since opening, and plan to at least once more.go see it now! i guarantee most of you will be back to see it again.

James Spader is such a wonderful actor, and he's even more awesome in his latest NBC series The Blacklist

While I'm unsure whether Kurt Russell's heart was in this project, the film delivers on many levels, and sets the future stage for ten seasons of Stargate on TV
One of my Top Ten favorite films, for sure.

$review_text.: I Loved Brokeback Mountain.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did a phenomenal job as Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist two cowboys who fall in love in the summer of 1963. I also thought that Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway did great jobs playing their wives-the only thing I have to say is that Anne Hathaway's hair looked very strange toward the later part of the film.Lots of people might make fun of the movie, saying that it is immoral to portray two men in love, but it is a sweet simple story and watching two hot guys making out in a movie is pretty interesting.

$REVIEW.: I will say that it probably needs to be viewed with the subtitles or watched more than once to absorb all the dialogue.  I read the book the next day and that helped.  So I will watch it again once the DVD is released.  With the proper focus, it becomes an almost dreamlike experience.  And if you don't believe  my title, just look at a list of American films released in 2012 and tell me which one even comes close to being this challenging to the viewer (that's what I mean by intelligent).

$REVIEW.: Probably a tad bit over-hyped and over-praised, Juno is a charming little tale about a girl who finds herself in a very womanly condition and is unprepared for life's new realities.  Ellen Page plays the title heroine with all the spunk and cynicism of an underage Janeane Garofalo in her nine month journey from copulation to parturition, as she struggles with her ever-expanding belly and the added pressure of turning her child over to an adoptive couple.Sometimes vulgar and always sassy, Juno may stretch the limits of believability with her quick wit at times.  Like male characters from Kevin Smith films, she's just a tad bit too quick and too smart.  A lot of her snarky comments get delivered with such speed that she's already snapped another off before the first makes sense.But as the film progresses, her "f-you" attitude to the world is revealed to be a faade hiding someone more tender and idealistic.  Roger Ebert says she's a character he wants to hug.  Although most audiences would agree, Juno herself would probably be quick to point out that Rog is a little old to be hugging underage girls.Like the previously released "Knocked Up", a heart exists at the center of Juno that makes the tale irresistible.  Of course, the film has its share of "bad guys", but the bulk of the story is about people trying to do what's right and who want to make the best of their time on earth.  It's easy to care about the people in Juno, to feel happiness when they're happy, and to hurt when they hurt.SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD: My biggest complaint with the film is it's reluctance to embrace what seemed like should have been the logical conclusion.  The film establishes a choice Juno must make: either to keep her child or turn it over to a wealthy, childless couple played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner.  The couple live in the suburbs, own nice cars, wear sweaters and drink expensive wine.  But Hollywood is not ready to make a film that praises the virtues of a two-parent household over that of a single mother, so something must happen to prevent that ending.  The people behind this film couldn't have their audiences leaving the theater thinking the movie promoted traditional views of the ideal home from a child, so they throw together a very reaching and questionable ending where a single-mother household is shown to be the best solution to the problem of a child born to a single mother.  Huh?  Exactly.  Again, Hollywood shows its political leanings.  Unlike a much brave film (Gone Baby Gone), Juno lost an opportunity to deal with the realities of what is/isn't the best environment for a child, and instead opts for a save conclusion that won't offend any feminists groups.  Too bad.

$review_text.: Richard Curtis really has completely run out of ideas
This was apparent in Love Actually which just rehashed all the most popular scenes from his earlier movies and this Bridget Jones sequel is just a reheated version of the first movie
The plotlines are the same - Bridget torn between reserved, uptight, underpant folding lawyer boyfriend Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and raffish Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who gets all the best lines and, as in the first movie, has far more sex appeal as a cocky, funny womaniser
Bridget obviously finds him irresistable but he keeps blowing his chances with her due his nymphomaniac sex life (in the first movie, his American fiancee got in the way, in this movie he is just about to close the deal when the Thai prostitute he ordered enters his hotel room, prompting the film's funniest line 'I'm up for it if you are' to the unimpressed Bridget)

Apart from Hugh Grant the rest of the movie is just a padded out unrolling of the on off romance between Bridget and Mark


Even the actors come across uninspired by the script

Zellweger appears less kookily sparky than in the movie and Colin Firth looks as if he is bored and embarrased with his part (he has publicly admitted that he never wants to act in another Bridget Jones movie)

Richard Curtis's material used to be original (when Four Weddings and a Funeral came out eleven years ago) but now his writing resembles a busker playing the same tired old tunes, keeping going only because the money keeps rolling in

Like all film genres, romantic comedies evolve

Curtis's conservative, trite, cliched offerings should make way for more creative, original productions.

$REVIEW.: For those curious as to whether Satan's Wife exhibits Mya's customary substandard quality, I'm sad to report that it does


 The image looks like it was pulled from an old bargain VHS tape recorded in the EP mode
 As with many of Mya's releases, there are no extras at all (not even a trailer), and you get two audio options: Italian with no subtitles and dubbed English that is very poorly voiced
The best thing you can say about the picture quality is that the aspect ratio seems to be correct--frequently not the case with Mya DVDs.The picture and sound quality are both bad, and the movie itself is not much better
I watched the English version, and I got the impression that that the lines were designed to fit the movement of the mouths rather than reflect what was written in the Italian script


The basic plot involves four women who had a one-night stand with Satan long ago, renounced their allegiance and now must pay the penalty, a penalty that comes in the form of one of the women's daughter, now a teenager and looking to avenge the insult to the Evil One
 Admittedly, the actor playing the daughter is pretty creepy (and her bad dubbing actually makes her creepier), but her lines are so overblown and the situations she finds herself in are so convoluted, you can't take them seriously

 In fact, the death of one character late in the movie is so illogical, you get the feeling that the actors were simply making it all up as they went along


 The film also features a number of "special effects" (such as people disappearing and reappearing for no real reason) that will make you miss the high standards of 1960s TV shows like Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie.Now take a look at the box cover and the tagline "The devil has never been hornier." You may think you're going to get a lot of nudity

 You don't.The plot itself is negligible, as it is in many of these Italian Exorcist/Omen rip-offs, but many of the scenes (especially those which involve the Charlemagne swords) play like Saturday Night Live parodies of these kinds of movies
It's nice to see John Phillip Law paired again with his Danger: Diabolik co-star Marisa Mell, but the opportunity to put the two together is wasted.We begin with a long dance sequence in which the women give themselves to the devils, but they all sport big smiles, as if they're showgirls auditioning in Vegas

 We end with the very 1970s "shock" ending, which isn't so much of a shock as a relief that the movie is over


 Basically this is a waste of your money and a waste of your time.

$review_text.: Crowd:  &quot;We want the Messiah&quot;Brian's Mum: &quot;There's no messiah in here.  It's just a mess.&quot; [or something similar]When the Python's first got together (in what was to be provisionally called 'Baron Took's Flying Circus', after the scriptwriter Barry Took who died last month), John Cleese insisted that the humour would not be based on puns.  Ten years later, he must have been disappointed by bits of the 'Brian' script.  By 1978 the Pythons had split totally as a TV formation, but came together for the occasional film.  The humour overall wasn't as brilliant, and nothing like as experimental, but it still had its moments.'Brian' was conceived, like Grail, as a series of sketches, which meant that the Pythons could use the rules of sketch production to their advantage, particularly when it solved budgetary problems.  (In what other genre could you find a movie where the main actors get reused in different parts again and again and again?)  But many of the sketches don't quite work -- e.g. 'Shekel for an ex-leper' could have been funnier, and 'Crucifixion?  Good.' just isn't long enough to qualify as a true Python sketch, despite the brilliance of the concept and Palin's acting.  To my mind, the truly magnificent Python sketch in this film, which easily ranks in the Python's Top 10, is John Cleese's  'Stoning' piece, in which he plays a Pharisee mixed up with an awful lot of English public schoolmaster.  This same schoolmasterliness also emerges in the almost-as-wonderful 'Romanes Eunt Domus' sketch, but you need to have endured at least a couple of years of Latin teaching to get the best out of that one.I heard Michael Palin talk about the first Brian draft in the fall of 1977 up at Oxford.  He was visiting Brasenose, his old college, and he spent the Saturday evening in the JCR telling whoever wanted to listen about 'Ripping Yarns' and this wonderful new plot called 'Brian'.  I don't remember much of what he said, but I recall being slightly disappointed by the movie when I eventually saw it two years later.I'm not a great believer, but I think the christian church have some justification in complaining about one element.  Overall the Pythons do a pretty good job of steering Brian in a parallel path to Jesus.  It's only when Brian gets put against the wall among all the soothsayers and prophets that he comes too close.  If Brian isn't supposed to be the christ, then it's unlikely he'd be telling parables about the talents, or a man with two sons, or the lilies in the field etc.  (Goodness knows what uproar would have occurred if the Pythons had tried to do the life of a prophet from another religion.)Despite Eric Idle's 'Always look on the bright side' eventually being adopted by many soccer crowds, the movie ends on an anti-climax, sotto voce, rather like Mark's Gospel.  The Pythons don't even allow Gilliam to explore the afterlife via animation.The Grail is the funnier of the two movies, but that's because it is entirely silly.  Brian has a couple of serious points to make -- that you should work it all out for yourself, and that factions shouldn't devote all their energies to fighting those whose beliefs come closest to their own.  Two serious points in one movie is enough for me.

$REVIEW.: As you have probably heard, Sin City is based off of Frank Miller's "Graphic" novels, and yes, graphic is a very good word to describe this movie.  The movie takes place in a fictional city, maybe nieghboring Gotham City or Metropolis.  However this city does not have any real heros, per se, there are a few good-doers, but they are also crooks (with the exception of Bruce Willis' character, John Hartigan).  This city has been overrun by corruption and director Robert Rodriguez does a great job of creating a digital atmosphere of the City.For the most part, this movie plays out like a Quentin Tarentino film.  The movie consists of three stories, which are not in chronological order, that eventually intertwine with eachother.  The first of those stories is about aging cop John Hartigan trying to save young Nancy Callahan from a serial rapist.  Hartigan gets betrayed by his partner (Michael Madsen) and is set-up for the kidnapping and an alleged rape.  This story concludes at the end of the movie.The second story revolves around Marv (Mickey Rourke).  Marv is a big, ugly guy that has a beautiful girl come into his life one day and he can't figure out why.  Well, she is murdered and Marv is set-up for the crime.  This eventually spirals into Marv going on a hunt for the person who killed his "angel".  The hunt leads him to the home of a Senator and the most powerful priest in town.  With the help of some of the town's female escorts, Marv eventually gets face to face with the killer of his "angel" for a showdown.The female escorts also help out Dwight (Clive Owen) in the thrid story.  Dwight becomes involved with a waitress (Brittany Murphy) and has to deal with her one-time companion Jack (Benicio Del Toro), who is the type of guy that always has a posse follow him around for protection purposes.  Now a chase that leads into the Escort's side of town endangers a truce that was made with the Mob and the police.  Its Dwight's job to try to prevent this truce from ending and to prevent a sort of "mob war".All of the actors do a pretty good job with the roles they are given and seem to be comfortable playing those characters.  Marv is the character with the most depth of any of the many characters.  As mentioned earlier, Rodriguez has done a great job with this movie.  The city and the atmosphere of the movie are great.  Also the colorization of the film is also something that has never been done before.  Some characters or particular item have color, while the majority of the film is in a black comic book looking color.  The visuals of this film are the most impressive aspect.My suggestion would be to see this film.  It is one of the most original films that I have seen in a while.  Also, the film may have changed the comic book genre forever.  If you have a weak heart, this may be too violent.  Otherwise, if you enjoy action movies with a good storyline and great visuals, then you should definately check out this movie.

For those who loved the book, just make that mental adjustment and start with a fresh slate and you will enjoy the parallel blossoming in the movie of the woman and her house.I took off one star since it put my husband to sleep, but I found it a pleasant enough romance with good scenery.  The main character is lovely and the various subplots such as the Polish laborer romancing a local girl expands the story to pull in the younger audience, I presume.

$REVIEW.: It's fitting that the best Bond film would receive the best blu-ray transfer, but this one's bound to exceed even your wildest expectations! Outside of some FX shots, which are unavoidably soft because of the source material, this film is sharp and looks like it was filmed yesterday. The level of detail is astounding. When you see the stunning Jill Masterson covered in gold, you'll swear you never saw the shot before. It has honestly improved that much.How's the audio? For a movie that's half a century old, the soundtrack is truly something to behold. While there isn't a lot of action in your surround speakers, what is there feels like it was meant to be there from the start and doesn't feel forced. Vocals remain clear and hiss free in your center channel. The only audio remasters I've heard sound better are some of the classic Disney films. But even when put next to their gold standard, Goldfinger stands tall!As for the extras and commentary? You pretty much get what you've gotten on the DVDs over the years. I would have liked some blu-ray specific HD extras. But we still get a couple of great commentary tracks and a plethora of SD content created for previous releases.Goldfinger is the classic Bond to own. Only the two most recent Bond films, starring Daniel Craig, look better. If you want to show what blu-ray can do for a catalog film, Goldfinger could easily become your reference film. With a new surround track and a picture that must look as new as the day it was filmed, your DVD-only friends will have to scoop their jaws off the floor, so they can run to their nearest store and pick up a blu-ray player.

 Lucille Ball is timeless, and this DVD brings the late 1960's and early 1970's era right back.
 In incredible living color.


 Everything looks remarkably vivid, and also the sound is amazing
 I can't get over the amazing picture and sound..
 The picture quality is better than any of the DVD tv collections I have

It's been too many years since I've gotten to see the lost treasure..
This Lucy show is incredible...It looks like you are watching from the front row of the taping.You never see this in syndication.


and that`s a shame since this is LUCY in LIVING COLOR..It's really fun to see all these guest stars..

 But, seeing her with her real life children is even BETTER.They are as gifted and talented as their parents...For all you Brady Bunch fans, if you get this box set, you can see Desi Arnaz Jr  at the height of his popularity .

and during the time that he had a guest appearance on the Brady Bunch

 Remember the episode about Marcia's diary.

and she mentioning that somedoay she wanted to be Mrs

Desi Arnaz Jr.Also you can see Eve Plumb (Jan Brady) guest starring with Donny Osmond on this DVD collection.It's too cool.
 This show is what we were watching in the late 1960's and also in the 1970's.I hope they will put out all the episodes onto DVD..The extra features are incredible as well


 I really love hearing Lucie and Desi just talking as they watch these episodes..


They were so young when they started on this show.

$review_text.: *** This comment may contain spoilers ***Alfred Hitchcock knew a recipe for a perfect thriller because he had made many but among his films, "North by Northwest" (1959) stands out as a great combination of suspense, sex, and humor. The film is based on a case of mistaken identity that in a course of a few days makes a likable (even if slightly arrogant) Manhattan ad-man Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) the object of a cross country spy hunt. Having no clue what is happening to him, Thornhill will be kidnapped by the spies, brought to an unknown mansion and after the questioning forced to get drunk. He will get arrested for a stealing a car and drunk driving of which he has no recollection. It is just the beginning. Next, he finds himself in the UN building talking to a man who drops dead in the middle of the conversation in front of hundreds of people. The worst part - the man is murdered and Thornhill has the murder weapon, the knife in his hand. Both, the police and the spies are on his trail and his only hope is to escape NYC by train where a very sexy blonde named Eve (Eva Marie Saint) is ready to help him. Their encounter leads to one of the sexiest scenes ever filmed without any sexual act involved.The film is packed with the witty and funny dialogs and one- liners as well as with artful and imaginative set pieces including Grant running for his life across the prairie from an evil crop-duster and the climatic chase on Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock who always wanted to make a film with two scenes - a chase on the face of a president and the attempt to wake up the Peru Ambassador during the assembly in UN who turned to be dead, had his dreams fulfilled with "North by Northwest" which he suggested should be called "The Man Who Sneezed in Lincoln's Nose". Among many of film's pleasures are Eva Marie Saint as sexy stranger on a train and James Mason and young Martin Landau as a duet of villains with a complicated relationship.

Gregory Peck plays a reporter working for an American newspaper in Rome who stumbles upon the story of a lifetime when a visiting princess (Hepburn) goes for a spree in the middle of the night. Thinking herself incognita, she eventually gives in to the sedative she was given back at the palace and in a drugged stupor ends up in his taxicab. The next day he shows her around the city, pretending to not to know who she is until he can get back to his typewriter and publish the story that will make him world famous. Unfortunately, a problem develops: he really begins to like her. William Wyler's direction is spiffy, Rome hasn't looked this good in ages, and Hepburn's fresh charm and adorable demeanor are simply to die for. A real classic!

$REVIEW.: Perhaps I was jaded because I read the book and was taken in by the complexity of the characters that Stephen King created, or perhaps I was anticipating that the movie would be a linear depiction of the events portrayed in the novel, but I was truly disappointed in this film.The movie, which does contain elements of King's novel, starts off by introducing us to four men, each friends to the others and each possessing the gift of ESP.  On an annual camping trip in the woods of Northern Maine, the men stumble upon a lost hunter, who is infected with an alien &quot;byrum&quot; which gestates inside him before being born in a graphic and bloody moment in the first third of the film.At this point, the story begins to become disjointed.  In the original novel, the alien lifeform was a bacteria, using host bodies to survive by taking control of them, implanting their own minds in the mind of their hosts.  One of the key elements of the book was that the alien lifeform was symbiotic, and genuinely needed human life to function.In the movie, the aliens are a monstrous collage of teeth and oozing worm, though monstrous and hideous, also largely unbelievable, especially when this &quot;worm&quot; emerges time and again from its host body, standing far larger than the man it has been hiding in.  This, amongst the many other obvious flaws in this film detract from what could still be an intensely frightening story.To its credit, it has some beautiful special-effects, created for the film by Industrial Light and Magic, a veteran effects warehouse known for producing the effects on such films as Star Wars and Jurassic Park.  The acting, too, is not a complete wash.  Morgan Freeman, a veteran actor of the stage and screen, takes on the role of a soldier with a vandetta against these alien invaders.  His character is unbelievable, as is most the film, but Freeman delivers a great performance despite the limitations of this script.I do not want to discourage anyone from seeing this film...as films of this genre go, I have definitely seen much worse, but for those who have taken the time to read the original novel, be warned that this film is a far cry from the nightmare Stephen King painted for us when he released this novel, a complicated depection of friendships and relationships faced with a horrific possibility of alien invasion.  It should be viewed with that realization that Lawrence Kasdan (who directed this film) was admittedly looking to do &quot;an (special) effects&quot; film.  He has, but as is often the case, effects take importance over story, leaving this Dreamcatcher blowing in the breeze.

$REVIEW.: Believe this or not but the voice behind Davy of Davey and Goliath (The Christian Claymated cartoon that inspired Moral Orel) and the voice beind the original Gumby is for the first time voicing Pinnocho swearing and all. At first it's just this stiff doll, then near the end of the movie the have the puppet moving. The ending is fast and freaky, the doll popping out. It's kind of messed up and funny but the plot is kind of slow. The middle aged mother has a long and clear full frontal nudity scene stepping out of the shower and just dropping her towel seeing Pinocchio staring at her. Talk about disgusting seeing this 40 - 50 year old actress (shivers), No wonder Pinocchio was just standing there frozen. A perfect spot for a low brow nose joke but no, his nose gets longer in a creepy shadow scene. The whole movie is this puppet who would have strings and not have strings switching through out tells this little girl to kill her mommy. That's basically the movie. The puppet was made by this bum who's getting the chair. He's scene in the movie just turning Yellow and just wimping out. Probably the worst overacting amateur acting scene I've ever saw. A great recommendation for a bad campy b-movie. But I'm sure Troma would have made this one funnier. Still, it's so bad it's good! Just not much of a classic.

$REVIEW.: As in all Jim Abrahams movies, HOT SHOTS milks the movie pool for jokes of all kinds...from TOP GUN to GONE WITH THE WIND; SUPERMAN to DANCES WITH WOLVES; THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS to ROCKY.  It all works; it's zany, unsaturated hilarity all the way.  Charlie Sheen stars as a rogue pilot whose father's tainted past has haunted him as well; Valeria Golino is hilarious in the scenes where her navel and stomach set new standards for erroneous zoning; Cary Elwes is properly smug as the handsome but not too bright hero; Lloyd Bridges is absolutely wonderful as the klutzy, remade admiral.  Usual good guy Efrem Zimbalist Jr. even shows up as the bad guy in this one.  There are the patented sight gags, particularly the ones going on in the background that make this movie one you could watch over and over and still not see them all.  It joins THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE movies in the honor roll of zany spoofs.

$REVIEW.: Here's another great film that sprung forth from the Czech New Wave: another film that, through its small gestures and subtleties makes some big statements. I'll leave it for you all to discover Forman's delightful insights into human behavior in LOVES OF A BLONDE. Suffice it to say, the plot---which involves a young girl's (Hana Brejchov&aacute;) attempt to find true love as a factory girl---could have become whimsical and even sentimental in other hands. In Forman's, the whole thing is grounded on earth. Instead of being a weightless romantic comedy, LOVES OF A BLONDE aims for realism, and while Forman maintains a relatively light touch on the proceedings, everything that happens to her---she finds love in a piano player, makes love to him one night, and then eventually pursues him to his home, where she meets his ever-bickering parents---still has its own kind of weight to it. The only way I can describe it is, I guess, the weight of real life. I haven't seen a more accurate recreation of a marriage that has dulled out in any other movie than I saw in the second half of LOVES OF A BLONDE, with Milda's parents: it is comic, yes, but it is also uncannily realistic, and maybe you'll recognize your own parents when you see the control-freak mother and the carefree father in this film. As for the blonde of the movie...well, she doesn't necessarily become sympathetic as the movie progresses, but we get a sense of why she begins to attach herself to the piano player Milda: she sees him as an escape from the drudgeries of factory life. Understand that, and you'll find the ending of this film poignant and maybe kinda sad. (Her dream has been shattered, but she keeps on believing it anyway, either out of hope or simply desperation.)But enough of my pretentious analysis, hehe. The point is, Milos Forman's LOVES OF A BLONDE, like Jiri Menzel's arguably more celebrated CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS, is a film that, though short at 85 minutes, takes its time to observe human nature in the face of oppression, in its own light and subtle way. Its comic surface only makes it seem like a slight movie; but in its subtleties and scenes of comic observation, it has a heck of a lot more to say about our little human foibles than a lot of other romantic comedies do. Recommended.

$review_text.: This is a wonderful movie, gently funny, and full of subtle little touches and terrific acting
It's not the best movie of all time, but very well crafted, and IMHO, deserved its Best Original Screenplay Oscar award for Sofia Coppola.The customer reviews of this movie here are really divided


I liked it a lot, but I can see why some people hate it.Why do people hate it? Well, basically, "Lost in Translation" has none of the standard beat-you-over-the-head thundering action sequences, no stunning computer graphics, no highly detailed futuristic/fantasy worlds, no hot sex, no violence, no plot twists, no grand themes of good vs
evil, or the end of the world
In fact, there is not much dialogue, and only the faintest wisp of a plot as the movie takes on a format that is more akin to a "Frontline" documentary or travelogue


The most common complaint thus seems to be "Nothing happens in this movie!" (That was my teenage daughter's epithet for this movie).A sense of loneliness and being unstuck in time pervades the mood throughout this movie, probably another real downer for people looking for something uplifting to watch


Although the movie is about a relationship between a man and a woman, this relationship fails to follow the standard Hollywood romantic plotlines - a conventional boy-meets-girl love story or "chick flick" this DEFINITELY is not (and believe me, I have been dragged to enough of these)


As many women seem to have written in saying that they hated this movie as loved it.And so, none of the basic formulas of the standard modern day Hollywood movie are present.Why do people like the movie? I think, first and foremost, the two characters of Bob and Charlotte and their situation have to appeal to you


One has to be able to have an understanding and empathy for their sense of loneliness and being unstuck in time, and also be able to share in their mutual joy at finding each other and being able to share in this brief friendship while traveling in a strange land


One also has to be able to understand their mutual respect for each other's boundaries, and not wanting to mess up each other's lives while together for such a brief period of time, in order to be able to appreciate, rather than disdain, the fact that they do not start having sex with each other, like so many conventional movie plotlines.Yes, coming from somebody who's favorite other movie is Conan the Barbarian (read my review!), you might wonder what the common thread is between the two movies


Well, there is none
 Despite being a very direct, goal oriented, and driven person, and despite being a great fan of the usual Hollywood fantasy- sci-fi -action adventure CGI superhero movies, I also have wonderful memories of many friendships with women, none of whom were or became my girlfriends or lovers

And so watching this movie brings on an intense feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu; I can almost see the movie and relate to it with my eyes closed.I would disagree with those who say that this movie was about finding your soulmate


I never got the feeling from this movie that Bob and Charlotte were 100% compatible, that they were engaged in a mind-meld, that they came to understand each other's psyche so well that they fit together like spoons, or that they had this burning desire to abandon their spouses and spend the rest of their lives together

No, this movie was just about two people who, by chance, had an opportunity to step out of the rigid mold of their regular lives and really enjoy each other's company for a brief moment in time
And then, through the same set of circumstances, they are parted again


They are together so briefly that they never get to know each other well enough to find out whether they would have made it as a long term couple


And that is what is so poignant and wistful about the ending of this movie - the sense of wishing for more, the sense of what if
But then again, better to not ruin this beautiful friendship by having sex and trying to live together.I was fascinated by the interaction of Japanese and Americans in this movie; some people thought this was a racist movie, with so much making fun of the Japanese habit of getting r's and l's mixed up when speaking English


Well, there was a lot more subtle cultural stuff going on than just the language problem in this movie


In the context of the whole movie, I did not think that the language problem was overblown - this really is just how most native Japanese mash up English (just like Americans mash up other cultures' languages)
Most native Japanese, I think, have enough confidence in the strength of their own culture to not feel embarrassed about this, just like Americans don't feel embarrassed when speaking another language badly

This movie was filmed, after all, in Japan, with a large number of Japanese working in the crew and cast of the movie
The reviewers who thought this movie was racist all seemed to be from outside of Japan (I haven't found one that came from Japan yet, and in fact, Sofia Coppola seems to be rather admired in Japan), and, I think these reviewers mainly have individual  problems with white American cultural hegemony and insensitivity rather than what is actually in this movie.Bill Murray is terrific in the role of Bob Harris

This is a mature actor in his prime, not the cynical jokester Bill Murray of old


I was a bit surprised by Scarlett Johansson
Her acting is terrific

With all the hype in the news media about Johansson's beauty, Sofia Coppola's natural, unvarnished portrayal of her in this movie was the surprising part


Very little make-up, revealing the small moles on her face, and in some close-up scenes the natural color of the roots of her hair


Some unkind people have written reviews mentioning a fat butt, but this is only if you like anorexic women, I suppose


Johannson is a lot shorter than I had thought, but well along the lines of, shall we say, a classical beauty, like Botticelli's Venus.The movie ends beautifully


Bob is set to return to America
He really wants to say good-bye to Charlotte, but is thwarted twice, first when she is not in her hotel room when he calls, and then again when Charlotte catches up to him as he is leaving the hotel

By then, Bob is surrounded by his Japanese hosts and you can see how their presence suddenly throws up an unbreachable wall between him and Charlotte

Watch their faces in this scene, you can see the tension, and then the pain in Bob's eyes, and the look of slight hurt and puzzlement, and then finally detachment, in Charlotte's face, as Bob gives Charlotte only the most cursory of cool good-byes while his hosts look on intently.I'll stop here, since I don't want to completely give away the ending of the movie, or get this review dropped by Amazon.com again


The final scene as Bob finds Charlotte again on his way to the airport is a terrifically poignant ending, full of mystery and an unspoken loss and wistfulness that comes only from the parting of a great friendship between a man and a woman.In our modern day world, fast-paced, and incredibly mobile and transient, such passing friendships happen altogether more commonly; few of these friendships lead to the sort of romances written into Hollywood movies of today

"Lost in Translation" is that rare movie which addresses this theme from every day life realistically, faithfully, and poignantly.

I had to see it unedited and uncensored without any interruptions.  Now available on VHS and DVD, all of this film can now  be seen.  This film is a mystery. So suspensful!  Doris day at her dramatic best.  The film starts with Doris in England walking through the fog.  Alone in the fog, a strange voice from somewhere calls out to her by name and says he is going to kill her.  She runs through the park unable to find an exit.  She runs for her life.  Cast includes Rex Harrison, John Gavin, Myrna Loy, Roddy McDowall, Hermione Baddeley and Hayden Rorke.

$review_text.: In the DVD documentary, Sylvester Stallone mentions the amazing fact of him co-starring in this film with Robert De Niro, since they went into completely different film genres after both actors were nominated for Best Actor in 1976: Stallone for Rocky and De Niro for Taxi Driver.  They had their superficial similarities, with both actors portraying angry, vengeful working-class Italian-Americans - but Stallone and De Niro represented opposite poles of post-war America.De Niro's Vietnam vet Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976), flawed boxing champ Jake La Motta in Raging Bull (1983) and comedian-wannabe Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy (1983) lived and created the American nightmare of obsessive, lonely nobodies gaining public recognition through savage violence and mediocre showbiz.In contrast, Stallone's boxing champ Rocky Balboa in Rocky (1976), in contrast, believed and represented the American dream of wholesome opportunity, fame and love for lonely nobodies. His Vietnam vet John Rambo also, like the 1970s antihero created by novelist David Morrell and De Niro's Bickle, brought the war to America in First Blood (1982) but then single-handedly brought about Reagan-era Cold War victories in Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Rambo III (1988).  His country singer-wannabe in Rhinestone (1984), unlike De Niro's Pupkin, uncritically and unambiguously celebrated the Rocky "bum making it big" theme, as did Stallone's Rocky-esque transformation of Travolta's 1970s angry anti-hero Tony Manero of Saturday Night Fever (1977) into a 1980s Broadway star (with Rambo physique) in Staying Alive (1983).  Unlike De Niro's honest portrayal of the brutal behaviour of gangster Noodles in Once Upon A Time in the West (1984), Stallone tried to make a blue-collar hero out of the corrupt trade unionist Johnny Kovac in F.I.S.T. (1978, see my Amazon review of this DVD).Thus, De Niro has been regarded as the best actor of his generation, whereas Stallone received an award for worst actor of the twentieth century.  By the mid-1990s Stallone lost all professional credibility with his monosyllabic, muscular superheroes and was looking at something completely different in order to save his foundering career.  And what better opportunity than this ensemble film with a cast of New York Method Actor gurus who appeared in critically acclaimed films directed by the likes of Martin Scorsese and Abel Ferrara.  Robert De Niro, who appeared in seven Scorsese-directed films,including Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, King of Comedy, Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995).  Harvey Keitel, having delivered some of his best performances under both Scorsese (including Mean Streets and Taxi Driver) and Ferrara.  Ray Liotta, who delivered an impressive performance in Goodfellas.  Cathy Moriarty, who delivered an impressive debut film performance opposite De Niro in Raging Bull.  Frank Vincent, playing strong supportive parts in Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Casino.  Annabella Sciorra, who appeared in two Ferrara films in the 1990s (The Funeral and The Addiction).And, believe it or not, Stallone did not only LEAD this impressive ensemble cast, he managed to pull off a critically acclaimed performance that shocked his critics.  And, like De Niro's La Motta in Raging Bull, his strong performance was also marked by Method Actor devotion translating into substantial (30 pounds) weight gains to play the overweight sheriff.  (Compare the scene of a fat Stallone lying on the bed in the director's cut with a bloated, drunk La Motta just before he is arrested by the police.)

But imagine if the creators took "Batman vs

The mix of traditional 2D animation and 3D animation seems out of balance at times, but the plot is so gripping, that I didn't even notice the contrast
The voice acting is superb (Michael Ansara as Freeze in particular), and the music is very Elfman-like (main titles is pretty much Elfman, though)

$review_text.: The government is doing nuclear tests in the middle of the Nevada desert. They plan to bomb a ghost town at 6 am and have evacuated the town. Reporter Larry Fleming (Keith Andes) is covering the story until he is assigned to a breaking story; a killer (Stephen McNally) has escaped from jail and is in the area. He takes along a girl (Jan Sterling) with him to Carson City, but on the way, he is stopped by convict Sam Hurley himself. Hurley has kidnapped a couple (Robert Paige, Alexis Smith) and called the woman's doctor husband (Richard Egan) to get him to fix his partner's wound. He chooses a less than ideal hideout: the ghost town in the middle of the bomb site.This was Dick Powell's first screen credit as a director, and he recieved good notices for his work. It is difficult to create atmosphere in the desert which offers little variety in the way of locations, but Powell works well with the outdoors. When the action moves indoors to an abandoned barroom, he manages to convey the claustrophobia of the captives. His direction is not fancy; he does what he needs to do to set the mood, but there is nothing overly beautiful about his work. The actors do a good job of aiding the tension of the film, and Paul Kelly gives a standout character performance as the old prospector.Interestingly enough, nuclear testing sites played a major role in Powell's life a few years later when he directed The Conqueror. The film was shot in the desert on grounds that had once been used for nuclear tests. Rumor has it that the location contributed to almost half of the cast and crew's contraction of cancer.

$REVIEW.: Midlife.  Your life is bland, you're in a rut, and your body's falling apart.  What to do?  Why not get together with some buds and go on a male-bonding motorcycle trip?  Let that testosterone rip, by golly.  Be cool (for maybe the first time ever).  What's so hilariously coincidental is that three of my close buds (all solidly middle-aged) just took a bike trip to the New Mexico Rockies (I was invited, but politely declined), so when I stumbled across WILD HOGS I had to pull up a chair and watch the madcap shenanigans of John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy gone wild.  (Yet unlike this cast, my friends didn't have a run-in with the Del Fuegos.  Darn.)The movie is silly, predictable, often lame, and decidedly over-the-top, but come on; it's still funny and entertaining--plus there is an undercurrent of midlife angst that resonates with old cusses like moi.  I especially liked the give-and-take between our heroes and the rough and ready Del Fuegos, led by a bristly Ray Liotta (who was born to play a biker gang leader).  But the Del Fuego who steals every scene he's in is the versatile Kevin Durand (who was outrageously fantastic in his brief role inSmokin' Aces); Durand's reaction, during the closing credits, when the Del Fuegos' bar was resurrected in a spoof to Home Makeover had me rolling on the floor.  So midlife might not be so funny, but trying to spice it up can be, and WILD HOGS proves it.--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

$REVIEW.: For a change, this movie was built upon innovative, original stuff: it's about the fate of a handful of Roman soldiers at the very collapse of their Empire in 400-something AD. They band together to help protect two gems: the last Emperor (in the person of a 10-year old boy) and Julius Caesar's prestigious sword... rumoured to be destined to the hands of a future great king. Bonus (and spoiler): the story establishes a link between these events and... the Knights of the Round-Table myth. Promising stuff, really!Alas... the movie doesn't live up to the expectation. In spite of recognized actors (Ben Kingsley, Colin Firth...), acting is poor with characters lacking depth and credibility, quickly losing viewer's support. Worse, some characters are clearly stereotypical: think about the India-born female warrior, or the brutal, brainless Goths... Also, some scenes are clearly reminiscent of Gladiator, featuring an air of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu to whole sections of the movie. Special effects are (thank God!) scarce... and cheap (poor digital rendition of scenery for instance). Finally, the end sequence drags on for too long with its load of good intentions, "everybody-will-be-alright", $1 pitch... At last, historic accuracy... well... isn't exactly the main focus of the director.Overall, the movie scores really low... which is too bad because the idea was there to make an outstanding movie, maybe even the beginning of a complete saga linking the Roman Empire to the advent of the Arthurian legend. What a missed promise, really!

$REVIEW.: Year 2065, planet Earth faces what almost everyone believes to be an alien invasion, one that consists of phantoms that suck a person's soul upon touching him/her. In the face of things, the military are pushing for a violent solution: shooting the Zeus cannon upon the meteor crater left behind after the arrival of the phantoms. Meanwhile, scientists Dr. Sid (modelled after Donald Sutherland, and also voiced by him) and Aki are running out of time in their efforts to find &quot;all the spirits&quot; needed to come up with an antidote to neutralize the effect of the evil phantoms, with a major handicap: they face incredible oposition from the Earth's ruling Council and the military because they have no proof but their faith and their hard work backing their redemption theory.This animated flick will have you on the edge far more than most 2001 human-acted movies. The animation work put behind it is simply amazing: this movie raised the standard by which computer-animated movies are to be judged technically. The best sample of this is, in my opinion, Sid, the scientist character whose realism with his white hair and his wrinkles leaves you doubting whether he is indeed an artificial character.Beside the animation, the script was also a brilliant on, falling within the ranks of fantasy movies. Since &quot;The Matrix&quot; I hadn't seen such an excellent movie of this kind. Rent it or buyt it, and enjoy it!

$REVIEW.: This is my most favorite movie of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. It is witty, charming and has all the class of a film today.  It is about a woman (Rogers) who seeks to get a divorce, she meets Astaire who falls in  love with her on first sight (typical)and she despises him. Eventually she  grows to love him as well and all ends happily. I highly recommend this old  classic.

$REVIEW.: This touching romantic classic is well done. The acting by Christopher Reeve, Jane Seymour, and Christopher Plummer (as the interfering manager W.F. Robinson) is superb. The musical score by composer John Barry is wonderful and also includes Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody. It has often been the musical choice of figure skaters for their skating programs and is actually where I first heard the music.Richard Collier (Reeve) is a playwright who lives in Chicago in 1980. One day, out of the blue, he receives the gift of a watch from an elderly woman who says, "Come back to me". He becomes haunted by this experience and becomes attracted to a picture in the hotel of a famous actress, Elise McKenna (Seymour). Through research he realizes that she is the same woman who gave him the watch and also that she died on the same day. He then begins his struggle, through hypnosis, to make it back to 1912 to renew his acquaintance with Elise.The movie is slow paced, but has some very touching moments. I love the scene of their first meeting when Elise says, "Is it you?" It contains a minimal amount of swearing (religious in nature)and also the ending love scene, although tastefully done, may cause it to be inappropriate for children under 12. I personally prefer the Hallmark movie, The Love Letter, which has a similar theme but is more appropriate for all ages.It is not surprising that this movie has become a cult classic, with fans meeting every October at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, Michigan, where the story takes place and was filmed. It was also filmed in Chicago.The special edition also includes an interesting featurette from 2000 about the making of the film and interviews with the actors. Christopher Reeve shares an experience from his own life that is very similar to what happens to his character in the film.  It must be noted that this featurette on the video is an edited version of the one on the DVD which is at least 15 min. longer.

$review_text.: I can't say I've ever enjoyed a Jane Austen adaptation as much as this one in my entire life!  The whole series is an absolute delight from start to  finish.Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle portray the lead characters of Mr

 Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett perfectly


 Never has Lizzie been so pretty,  witty or charming nor has Darcy ever been so brooding, mysterious or  handsome as in this series


 The chemistry between the leads is electric  and the sparks certainly fly in one of the best romantic love stories ever  told.The fact that the writer's have taken the step of showing more of a  background for Darcy also helps the viewer appreciate what a good and kind  man he really is all along, rather than, as in other adaptations, he  appears to suddenly change into being nice.The casting of Julia Sawahla  as the selfish, stupid Lydia Bennett was also inspired
 She carried off a  difficult role so well that in the end you still have to like her for all  her faults.As for the rest of the cast - there wasn't one that let the  series down one tiny bit
 Notably, David Bamber as Mr
Collins was  suitably sweaty and snivelling, Alison Steadman as Mrs
Bennett was  fantastically highly strung, Adrian Lukis as Wickham was a suave villan and  Anna Chancellor's, Miss

Bingley was deliciously nasty.If I could give  the rating more stars I would


 It's an absolute must for all Jane Austen  fans and if you're not a fan already then watch this and you will be!

$review_text.: you know these pass few years we've been getting tons of remakes of classic horror movies and none of them comes close to Carrie I actually prefer the remake over the 1978 version but Chloe Moretz did an outstanding job as Carrie you felt every emotion that she was going through and you just wanted to be there for her when the character's were bullying her and I honestly can relate to that feel cause I to was bullied in school as well I'm sure everyone in this world have been to and I really want to congratulate  Kimberly Peirce for capturing that in the movie to make peoples eye's to be a little more open for those who are getting bullied. So the story is base off of Stephen Kings novel which I'm now interested in reading now to me Carrie wasn't like a monster like Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers were who both had mindless slashing. she was normal like us and wanted to fit in but there were limits for her and her emotions got the better of her causing destruction with her telekinesis powers which was badass hahaha I wish I had those powers but one of my favorite sayings is Great Power Comes Great Responsibility cant believe I said that but it's true right ?! overall fantastic movie I also had to get the NECA Carrie figure cause I'm fan boy now you can also read up my review on that figure if your interested.

 Unless they aired both seasons back to back, this is incorect and you're only buying 1 season

 However, that being said, you should still get a kick from all the antics and it's always fun and enjoyable to watch Nick whose so cute and obviously a very patient guy.

$REVIEW.: An excellent performance from all concerned in what is basically, in spite of its hype, a dark homophobic movie intended to make gays go back into the closet and bolt it from the inside.  It concerns a serious of vicious attacks on gays in a particular neighborhood of London, presumably from real events. One is told that "neighbors" get together to fight back.  Absolutely no such thing.  Not one single attack is traced to its perpetrators.  What one gets is a bunch of boring homophobic suburbanites having dinner while a gay boy gets murdered right outside. Kudos for having dared to expose the reality of sex between teens and adults.  Many times, the teen is the aggressor, which was portrayed in the movie with chilling and heartbreaking accuracy.  Wilby and Graves, of "Maurice" fame, are bit players in this one.  Time has been kind to Graves, not Wilby. The movie belongs to the teen and his adult target. Real chemistry there! I like the movie, not the content.

The film is about a woman (Kimberly Elise) who goes down the wrong path -- not having trust in herself and not having trust in God.  She travels a long, hard journey in her life -- prison, hate, anger, lost love, domestic violence and family.  Suddenly, the preacher (T. D. Jakes), encourages her to put God first in her life, build up her strength, learn forgiveness and never give up hope.

$REVIEW.: Ok, so I watched it last night and from my experience, I liked it


Here is why


I have 20yrs Navy Medicine experience (taking care of my Marines)
Field Medicine training, Emergency Medicine and Cold Weather training had me watching it from a perspective of someone who would think of these things first.Now, after reading some negative reviews, they have some valid points but I suggest you rent first and decide if you want to buy.1 - 3 people are on a ski slope and no cellphones? Did I miss something? LOL2 - Wolves may be pack animals but they would not go out of their way to attempt to outsmart 3 humans and then lose interest in the female after taking down the males? Sexist wolves is what one reviewer said
I laughed but he was right.3 - Yeah, these kids are STUPID


Case closed.I cringed at the broken leg from the first person dropping/jumping


I perished the thought of what a wolf could do if it ever DID attack while I was down


Not a likely thing to happen but nothing is impossible


(Sort of a SPOILER) I cringed again when the person gets hit by a falling cart while trying to escape.As I said, it's worth the rent as long as you know some of the story's low points and can let them slide.

$review_text.: Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone could do so much more.This movie starts out with Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone's family  living in NY city, she with a high paid job and he working from home on low-budget documentaries.  He's the house husband and she the breadwinner.  A single incident scares them into abandoning their hectic city lives and they bail to the country.Cold Creek manor is a crumbling mansion in the country, with a history.  You see the surprise on the locals when a new family moves in.  You know there is something odd from that. Ironically, they move in, with no history of the place and none of the locals offer any insights.  Anyone who's moved into a small town knows there is always one busybody that has to fill you in, once you are committed.  It just seems so vague and unrealistic here.  Closing on real estate, selling and buying is a long process.  They must have a great lawyer.As time goes one, some unsettling items are found in the house and outside.  Then a development forces Dennis Quaid to look further into the property he has moved his family into.  Things go downhill from there.I can't go further without ruining the few so-so surprises this movie has in store.  There are a couple of tense moments.  The real irony of it is, this movie is probably more like real life than all the slashers or other horror movies out there.  This means you don't get the adrenaline rush, but it is somewhat more believable and boring unfortunately.The characters are also off.There is development in ways that make no sense.Sharon Stone goes from powerhouse business woman to a timid housewife in flowered dresses.Dennis Quaid goes from a inquistive documentary maker, to one with his head in the sand about this house.The teenage girl is a sassy city snot, and changes to sassy country snot (OK this was predictable)and the boy becomes obsessed with the items found in the house, but only enough to rattle a couple people.There are a lot of underlying currents here that never are used or explained.  It goes from tense to tenser and then really bad in a single scene.Also there is a shot when they are being helped from the roof, where and a man strolls by in the background.  Is this the director's attempt at an Alfred Hitchcock manuever?

Controversial, censored, re-censored, and re-released.The film itself is quite impressive for the time it was released


The film was also heavily cut for it's theatrical release the &quot;snails and oysters&quot; scene is probably the most famous of the cut scenes


This scene was cut for its sly reference to bisexuality where Crassus attempts to seduce one of his servants by telling him that he likes eating both snails and oysters (which can be compared as being attracted to both men and women.) The audio of this scene was damaged so Anthony Hopkins read Lawrence Olivier's dialog.The story follows Spartacus, a Roman gladiator who leads a slave revolt against Rome
He later gains a major following and the senate argues as to how to stop him.Spartacus is portrayed by Kirk Douglas in the film and looks remarkably like his son Michael Douglas.The DVD is loaded with special featuresThere are two audio commentaries one with an alternate musical soundtrack.There is a restoration demonstration, theatrical trailer, sketches by director Stanley Kubrick, storyboards, hundreds of publicity photos, lobby cards, production photos and other ephemera.There are also numerous interviews and behind the scenes footage


The interviews are with Peter Ustinov which were made in 1960 and 1992, There is also an interview with Jean Simons made in 1960 There is also newsreel footage of the filmmakers attending various funtions


Finally there is an extended scene and surviving audio of a deleted scene
There is also a showing of the script from a deleted scene that has been lost.This is a release that should not be missed.

$review_text.: I love watching "The Homecoming" and watch it faithfully each Christmas on dvd.  I think that the storyline set against the backdrop of the Great Depression, has much to offer each of us in this day and age... for as much as things appear to change, things really stay the same: worry over loved ones missing; lack of money; squabbles between siblings; self-reliance; but MOST importantly the message that LOVE and hard work combined will get us through anything.  I watched a grown up, but still charming, Richard Thomas in the move "Taking Woodstock" last weekend, so it was fun to see him so young here.  Patricia Neal makes for a strong-willed, yet emotional mother, and provides a nice counterweight to Thomas' sensitivity.  It really is a delightful movie which one should share with one's family.

However, if you're looking for a value buy of two great movies, then this DVD set will do nicely.Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day was a masterpiece, and yet this movie adaptation is not only faithful to the novel, but in my opinion outshines the book. One reason is the excellent casting. Sir Anthony Hopkins plays the by-the-book butler whose icy demeanor actually belies a fondness and even love for his efficient and charming housekeeper, played excellently by Emma Thompson. His insistence on decorum and adherence to the politics of the houselhold cause him to refrain from ever proclaiming his true feelings for his housekeeper, and so also goes his chance of personal happiness. Fast forward years later, and the aging Hopkins now has a new master, an American [played by Christopher Reeve]...he has the opportunity of engaging a new housekeeper, and thinks of his old housekeeper...but things are not as easy as he believes...and whether he gets to rectify his past mistakes makes up the rest of the story. A well-told tale of love lost, and also a good movie that provides a glimpse of politics in England during a time when Germany was rising in power.Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility (1995) never fails to enthrall me. It has everything one would expect of a classic movie - a good plot [ thanks in large part to Emma Thompson's excellent screenplay], stellar casting, gorgeous sets, costumes and lush scenery of the entrancing English countryside.The story of Sense & Sensibility is at heart a warm and insightful portrait of two sisters and their relationship wit each other, as well as their romantic interests and a powerful social commentary of society in regency England. Those who are familiar with Jane Austen's works will appreciate how perceptive an observer she was of society at large and remarkable in her capability to capture powerful human emotions on paper.The plot of Sense & Sensibility the movie revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor & Marianne, who upon the death of their beloved father are forced to move [together with their mother and younger sister] to a cottage in the English countryside and live on a paltry 500 pounds a year [due to English law at the time where property passes down through the male line]. Elinor [played excellently by the talented Emma Thompson] is the older, and more wise [sensible] sister, who tries not to let her emotions rule her, in direct contrast to her younger, feisty sister Marianne [Kate Winslet] who is passionate, outspoken and open in displaying her emotions.Elinor falls for Edward Ferrars [an awkward yet deferential & handsome Hugh Grant] who due to a youthful indiscretion is unable to follow through on his attachment to Elinor. Marianne, on the other hand falls hard for dashing rogue Willoughby [Greg Wise], ignoring propriety and openly displaying her affections.The rest of the story deals with how the Dashwood sisters resolve their plight, and the story is made even more compelling by the other characters who certainly add to the depth of the storytelling - Colonel Brandon, a retired officer, who though much older, harbors a deep affection for Marianne [Alan Rickman], the callous sis-in-law Fanny Dashwood [Harriet Waller], the scheming Lucy Steele [Imogen Stubbs]and numerous other characters, who though secondary to the plot, are certainly memorable.Taiwanese director Ang Lee [of Eat Drink, Man Woman & Wedding Banquet fame] certainly proves his mettle here and manages to flesh out amazing performances from his cast, and delivers a gem of a movie, and a true classic.

$review_text.: Ever since I was little, I have absolutely loved unicorns. When I saw this DVD advertised here on Amazon, I looked into it and found what looked like a good movie with an interesting plot. The story revolves around a little girl, Polly, whose old mare gives birth to a unicorn foal before dying. Polly soon comes to love the foal, of course, and pretty soon her love and loyalty are tested when a bunch of greedy circus people attempt to steal the unicorn for publicity purposes. I decided to give the movie the benefit of the doubt and bought it sight unseen. Sadly, this was a mistake.I guess I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews, because corniness was only one of this movie's faults. For starters, the depth of the story I had hoped for simply isn't there; the movie's tone is so completely juvenile, I expect only really small children would appreciate it. You may very well think,"Well, of COURSE it's juvenile; it's a kid's movie!" It's been my experience, however, that a really good children's movie will move adults as well. Such classics as, "Narnia", "The Secret Garden", "A Little Princess", and the wonderful "Harry Potter" series are all stories that, while often marketed as being for kids, have proven to affect adults as much as children (if not more so).The characters in this movie are not in the least memorable and not very believable as people. The "heroine" annoyed me instead of rousing my sympathy, and the so-called villains seemed to be nothing more than morons who were placed in the story to be made fools of. The leader of the circus was a greedy jerk, but there's not much more to be said for his character as far as affectiveness goes. The rest of the "bad guys" were embarassingly stupid. Trust me, Daniel Stern was more terrifying in the "Home Alone" series than these guys. The only faintly good point of the film was the unicorn, although he certainly couldn't save the film all by himself. Even he, however, had a few downfalls. As an adult, the unicorn is realistically played by a real horse, with a gorgeous glowing effect that magnifies his magical appearance. When he first appears as a foal, however, he is not played by a real horse but created with the most pathetic animation I've ever seen. The flying scenes were awkward as well and somewhat took away from the magical effect of the unicorn. The ending of the movie was abrupt and rather awkward, trying to patch a bunch of different resolutions together in one scene (more than one character had some sort of dilemma going on).All together, this film tried to be moving but came off as a bad caricature of a moving film rather than the real thing. You may think I'm being too harsh since it is, after all, just a kid's film. However, if this is what's considered the ideal children's film, then I strongly believe that children are not being given enough credit. Children are multi-dimensional in many ways and a movie should not be dumbed down in order to impress them. I certainly don't think this film is harmful to kids-it probably won't affect them much at all if they're over four-but I would say it's totally unnecessary for their intellectual development. I guess it depends on what you're looking for; if you want a film that effectively teaches morals, I recommend you look elsewhere (check out the movies I listed earlier). On the other hand, if you'd like a film that resembles a circus-pretty good entertainment, nice special effects, and no depth whatsoever-you might very well prefer this one.

$review_text.: This is THE best film I have ever seen. it has made me eager for the sequel, the Two Towers. This cast is awesome, the scenery is beautiful and rugged, and the special effects have no equal. But beyond that, this movie makes you feel every emotion, from joy in the Shire, to terror as the Fellowship is chased by Ring Wraiths and Orcs, to complete and total sadness at the raw pain of the characters. Elijah Wood is awesome as Frodo and Sir Ian Mcklellan rocks as Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen really is a great Aragorn and Sean Bean does an excellent job of portraying the very torn Boromir. Liv Tyler was great as Arwyn even though we don't get to see much of her and Cate Blanchett's portrayel of Galadriel sends chills up the spine. In short, from start to finish, this movie is truly one of the best films ever made.

So I bought this to watch with my daughters the sound is HORRIBLE I had the volume as high as it would go up on my new flat screen and playing in my new dvd/blue ray player up as high as 67 (I think that was as high as it went) and still I wish I could have turned it up


Picture was grainy worse than watching this on instant streaming on my wireless.


SO disappointed in the quality of this recording and wish I would have bought a used blue ray instead


Save your money and buy a better quality recording.


Unless your watching this on an old tv and your not used to crystal clear HD

I don't know how the sound would be.

$review_text.: There has been some debate by previous reviewers of 'The Most Dangerous Game' about the quality of the digital transfer on to DVD. My own view is that the picture quality is outstanding. You do occasionally catch sight of  objects shimmering, but the effect is negliable. What really hits you is  the incredible sharpness and clarity of the print. This isn't limited to  the picture either - the sound quality is equally as impressive. For a  movie 70 years old you simply could not hope for better. The only extra  feature is a very good commentary by Bruce Eder, whose knowledge of 'The  Most Dangerous Game' seems limitless. This guy really knows his stuff and  what's more, he delivers it in a very relaxed and friendly manner. The film  itself is an action packed 63 minutes that is enlivened by a luscious Fay  Wray with great support from Leslie Banks and Joel McCrea. The relatively  short running time actually helps maintain a high level of suspense and  interest - it feels like an 80 minute movie but with all the boring stuff  cut out! To label 'The Most Dangerous Game' as a classic is an  exaggeration. It is still a well-made, exciting movie that has stood the  test of time exceptionally well. The film itself deserves 4 stars, but the  great picture quality, sound and commentary make this DVD worthy of a 5  star rating.

$REVIEW.: This is a marvelous love story with some surprising twists.  I wish more of the gay and lesbian movies were this good!  On top of that, it takes a good, hard look at the effects of extreme, far right religious groups--these were Mormons, but any Christian fundamentalist group could be plugged in the same framework.  It shows how destructive, how hard, how unloving these groups are, and it is effective in doing so.  As one recovering from Christianity, I can tell you that the fundamentalist groups, regardless of denominational stripe, carry that same hate-filled attitude.  This movie is a good demonstration of the effect of that sort of hate.

$review_text.: I'm a Romero fan and zombie genre for sure, so like most, I'm always on the look-out for "dead gems" out there in the indie world.  Don't forget, Romero IS an indie-producer (Land of the Dead-is an exception).  I also like wry humor, and appreciate when it's worked in with a good dose of health irony. THAT IS WHY I'm giving this film full kudos.  The zombie makeup and " zombie-acting" is what you honeslty expect outta low budget.  Free "zombies" doing their best.  Make up....grease paint and fake blood with some nice effects, to be honest. I really (really) liked the script and contrary to those who did not agree, the character's acting.  I thought it was far above the normal bar, for an indie.  The story line is really one that, had this been big-budget, I think we'd see reviews singing praises versus ones being negative because it was an indie.  I watch my Romero & Other "Dead" films regularly, and I keep popping this in JUST as regularly.

$review_text.: Hesitation over the title of this review was purely for consideration of people who might have taken offense at the use of homosexuality in the traditional role as a comedic device for dehumanizing people


 In this Fantasy Fashion Designer Barbie role play kit, we are presented with two suspect homosexuals, the flamboyant  Black assistant fashion designer, and the quarry closet  homosexual who has to have his disorder pointed out to him, preferably in an embarrassing public denunciation


 Barbie  has to  learn  the  need for her to  script  and  typecast sexuality around  her because she is the sensation (fem fatal) for persuasion predominant in the sphere of people around her


 A Countrified Fantasy Fashion Designer Barbie Killer Instinct--role play kit


 And it is perhaps an interesting microcosm of analysis to vaguely note the teddy bear appeal assigned to the openly gay Black character, artistic, talented and unflinching

 It is the idea that for women, gay men make the best friends, that I won't quote yet I seem to have heard it somewhere in the cultural media stream at some time in the past


 Thus a possible depolarizing of "sexual prowess" is covertly used to adjust traditional racial stereotypes, (and that term is taken straight from multicultural theory)

 Further complicating the plight of the Black male character in the film, is the Civil War reinactment-buffooning in the presumably lingering prejudicial South, where no doubt the image of African Americans as sexually iconoclastic, bandages wounded  White male libido traditionally injured by jibes of phallic innuendo

 Surely considerate people everywhere are tired of this dredging up of unpleasant or bawdy associations; circumcision is perhaps the original anthrospecific-insult (precursor to sexual dysfunction then marital dysfunction and the whole syndrom of social ills that erode social fabric from its core) but anthropologically the film is enriched elsewhere.Irving's character Jenny Garp, feminist author, cites being made a "sexual suspect", clearly there are procedural tolls long since put in place to accustom these suspicions of men and women

 Half asleep through the whole movie, I forget the Witherspoon character's name, but she essentially indicts a suspect homosexual male at one point, out of an urge perhaps, to solidify a group cathartic that had pleasantly gone on over the life of the individual in that community as a dissatisfactory standard of humane and non-discriminatory practice


 Barbie's tantrum must be a blood letting, her role is too prominent for softer and tactful, retiring or inhibited social display...she must be the "bell of the ball", the "queen bee" with attendant phalanxes of maidens, a sort of warrior aspect appreciated and encouraged in the feminine; whereas dominant female politicians  must stride more carefully to avoid becoming vilified on a masculine playing field
 There are no masculine defenders of the imasculine, no Garps to befriend gay football players

 Historic Southern  racism is lampooned, only to be replaced with the sexism of preferential or select social stereotyping and discrimination based on repression spawned feminine outlets of gay labeling, a favorite innocuous quarry for young girls influenced by such movies
 It's a man's world, so go kick the "queers", it's perfectly safe.--is the message

 Really it is just a comprehensive green light for offensive young women to go around tarring everybody with the gay label they don't particularly approve of--such sweethearts, somebody slap them


 The gay prompt has grown to such dimensions in the mass medias adverse stimulus conditioning we had to endure the whole "Brokeback Mountain" odyssey and cultural crisis
 Something just keeps wanting to load it into everybody's heads.Murphy Brown is the elder role model for Fashion  Barbie, what its like to grow up, become a crochety, semi-retired blonde who has scaled political obstacles, become Mayor, wear a suit, and combat the depreciation of appearing older than a plastic toy fresh from the hot injection  mold, while she dotes over the marital selection of her son
Bergen is what happens to Barbies when they grow old, a question that any would be Barbie surely asks, once the question has been loaded for her through symbolism, because just as surely, the pretense of a "Barbie" precludes higher order thinking skills, any anticipatory or empathic reflection--Barbie being the conceited thing it is

 That conceit is no more abundantly clear when the quarry queer, a meek and unassuming character is viciously stereotyped, "Why don't you just admit you're a homosexual!?"  Why don't the movies just admit they're [....] mind control, written by apprentice flunkies who basically jerk-off the emotional susceptibility of innocent victims who paid money for maybe something more enlightening?Barbie has the decidedly impertinent and socially devastating master stroke saved for when after tremendous wedding preparation, long distance coordination with the big city, hundreds of people, relatives, costumes, food, etc

(a large diamond of course, conspicuously selected in a macabre scene with jewelry store ghouls (...full staff after midnight on overtime...right...only the very best for princess)--night of the living dead materialists in their empty catacombs of display cases), she changes her flighty little mind in the nick of time, and before a well timed downpour that punctuates her contempt for the wedding and the wedding party

 Rese Witherspoon needs these infant terrible outlets, her puckish and perky hypercriticality is what this [....] cesspool of a culture thrives on...or so it would be pawned off on us


 You won't like this next paragraph, oh great ones, but never assume All the munchkins where you pop in to do your do-do (make films)  are salivating and wringing their hands to come to greet you, kiss your shoes, or get your damn autograph.Salt Lake City must be summoned, like the great unwashed suddenly up for review by some nether world superiors alighting, to appear as extras  in the upcoming romp Legally Blonde II, (radio ads November 22, 2002 call for the comely and college aged, dark suited political types, and young children)


 Sounds like the mothership giving instruction for disembarking, all who remain behind are condemned


 And don't you dare walk your walks where you live and cross paths with the film industry's eminent domain, the larger than life have minions of hounds carrying clipboards to accost all who stray into where the "magic is made", Ogden Utah's 25th Street and set for the tv drama 'Hardwood', or 'Viagrawood' or whatever its name was
 The perception is: We are a needed, but despised adjunct to opulence, a rancid and rabble public chattel for them to cull and elect from our insignificance (they pretend to entertain and in fact constantly insult) one or two anointed surfs to stardom


 Who wants to be the next American Idol?  Or, `The One'

 `..or thinks they can dance?'..


`...or cook?'  I think its now a rancid (mostly citrus) entertainment media too.

$REVIEW.: True, as some reviewers complain, sometimes the plots do not add up in these stories. But that is not the fault of the tv series in this DVD set, but of the author. Agatha Christie was notorious for that, to wrap things up in the end in a highly unlikely way. For instance, don't be surprised to see the deus ex machina of some aunt that arrives out of nowhere to provide the missing bit of motive (usually a will, which all to often is also changed many times without knowledge of the tv viewer)for a killer. Very elementary, well, not.That is annoying since what made for instance Murder She Wrote (a Marple offspin in the US) so popular as a whodunit was that in principle, with the info shown in the episode, you could work out at least a bit who might be the killer. Well, apparently Agatha Christie said the made most of her plots while doing the dishes, maybe that was the reason they were not her strongest point?Despite all this, all I can say about the bad plots is: who cares? Agatha Christie  remains the undisputed best of crime writing, and to me Tommy and Tuppence from the 80s plus the two movies that are included here, are still the best, since they embody to me all that makes Agatha Christie great: romantic atmosphere.Because, what a wonderful nostalgia we get in these series, not only the roaring twenties where, as one reviewer on some BBC site remarked, the killer either always seems to wear knickerbockers or a silk smoking jacket, but also the 80s themselves. How tv has changed! In so many series now we have seen it: two main characters that have chemistry, but they do not seems to know they are both attracted to each other, and on it goes, season after season, until finally the steamy sex arrives we all have been waiting for? I rather go for atmosphere and a good old fashioned story! The attraction or chemistry between Tommy and Tuppence,  is there, but never goes further than a sort of wiggling with the head lip on lip sort of kissing that is supposed to mean the French way of doing it. The rest we can work out ourselves, right?The costume drama is as lush as Poirot or any other series mentioned by reviewers, the atmosphere is truly romantic, the lovely Francisca Annis who, with her sidekick truly seems to enjoy the thrill of it all, who can ask for more entertainment?Of course, I would also want to recommend Poirot, the 80s and new Marple series, and others, but although a cliche, this is the best of them all and they don't make these anymore!

$review_text.: This is an absolutely first rate film, of a girl who must overcome a childhood with a manipulative, crazy, destructive single mother.  The cast is simply stunning:  Wright Penn, Zellweger, and Pfeiffer in perhaps her greatest performance.The situation is that an adolescent, when her mother goes to prison, must go into the foster care system.  What she experiences, as is the stuff of narratives, is truly horrible.  Any time that she builds a relationship, it is destroyed or revealed as worthless.  Throughout all of this, she begins to see her birth mother for what she is, and seeks to go her own way.But her mother, even from prison, can control events by the relationships she can create.  All over again, it is like a recapitulation of the daughter's entire life, which spurs her to seek the truth even at the cost of traducing her inner self.  They have a terrible fight, played almost entirely off stage but understood in moments of simple dialogue, that is the fight for the girl's life itself.Alison Lohman, as the daughter, is simply extraordinary.  There is not a moment that rings false or hollywood-chinsey, but her pain and struggle is achingly real.  Of course, the character has some talent, as an artist like her mother, but also in her ability to form relationships.  She has seen so much pain and self-destruction, that she learns she must fend for herself.  I do not think I have ever seen a film that succeeds so completely as a coming of age drama of finding a path through the pain.  She becomes tough, but she does not lose the perceptive sensitive core that might show her a way to become a healthy, loving adult.  It is amazing to watch and there is not a jot of sentimentality, only realistic tragedy and growth for what it is worth.Warmly recommended.  This is a moving journey that says so much about what youth must survive through our pathetically damaged social system and deficient public policy.  Lohman is amazing and so are the other stars.  This a both great drama and social commentary.

$REVIEW.: I'm torn between a four and a five star.  I picked four stars because the storyline is very simple.  I agree it's geared more for kids rather than adults.  There are only a few characters throughout the movie which makes it easy for kids to follow.  However, it is too violent and dark for young children.  We started out watching it with our 2 and nearly 4 year old and they had a hard time once it got really dark and more dragon hunting.  But, it's a PG rating and should have known better.  With that being said, my husband and I really did enjoy it.  The world that was created was incredible and my husband and I were fascinated with the animation.  The fact that it is so different than the standard Disney Pixar stuff we usually watch really got our attention.  We thought the voice talents were great and we really enjoyed the score of the movie.  Kind of made us think of Chinese techno at times.  I hadn't heard of this movie until it popped up on Amazon as a pre-order and had several wonderful reviews.  I'm glad I took a chance with a movie unknown to us.  We'll be watching this occasionally and I'm sure our two kids will get into it when they aren't so scared.

$review_text.: The mystery of how well the new Bond would replace Roger Moore in the fifteenth "official" Bond movie was over with "The Living Daylights."  The style of the movie was set with the opening scenes, where three double-0 agents parachute onto Gibraltar as part of an infiltration exercise.  Unfortunately, someone in the exercise is using real ammunition, not paint balls.  Timothy Dalton shows that he is made of Bond material as he jumps onto an escaping jeep and fights with the bad guy as the jeep full of explosives catches fire, flies off a cliff, and explodes, with Bond having departed in a typically clever fashion but moments before the fireball erupts.Timothy Dalton was a no-nonsense Bond in this movie.  He eliminated the numerous one-liners that seemed to be a Roger Moore characteristic in favor of a leaner and meaner and much more spy-like Bond.  In this first of two Bond movies Dalton had yet to achieve the presence and technique of either Sean Connery or Roger Moore, but he breathed new life into the series.The plot bears some characteristics of "A View to a Kill" in that both films portray the Soviet Union as a friendlier nation beset with evil doers who would take advantage of the kinder, gentler, Soviet Union.  This time the criminals are looking to do a novel sort of bait and switch, profiting by buying drugs from Afghanistan and selling them in the Soviet Union.  Unfortunately, the money belongs to the Soviet Union.Mixed into this plot is a Soviet defector, KGB General Koskov (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;).  Bond's mission was to get Koskov out of East Germany and into Berlin.  However, it appears that someone wants Koskov dead, as a beautiful assassin attempts to kill Koskov as he attempts to defect.  Bond has a chance to kill Kara Milovy, well played by Maryam d'Abo, but he elects to shoot the gun from her hand instead.The plot thickens during the debrief of Koskov.  Koskov tells British agents that General Leonid Pushkin, played by always excellent actor John Rhys-Davies, is executing a program to eliminate Britain's secret agents.  Unfortunately, KGB appears to retrieve Koskov from the English estate safe house and the British agents are unable to learn more.  Bond turns to Kara Milovy.  Bond leads Kara to believe he is going to get her out of the country to meet Koskov, her patron.  However, Bond has yet to learn where Koskov is.What follows is an action-packed movie that is nicely plotted and interesting to the end.  There is an excellent battle scene in Afghanistan (filmed in Morocco), and an even better escape scene from Afghanistan.  After all that action there remains one loose end to tie up, which Bond does nicely.During the film we meet another excellent supporting actor, Art Malik as Kamran Shah, an Afghani chief.  We also meet Joe Don Baker as self-centered Brad Whitaker.  There is yet another version of Felix Leiter, this time a less than memorable version of Leiter.  Caroline Bliss is a mediocre version of Miss Moneypenny.The special effects were much more down-to-earth versus those in "A View to a Kill."  The ubiquitous Aston-Martin returns with rockets, rocket boost, outriggers, and sundry other gadgets.  There is a sliding glass door used as a weapon by an assassin.  The same assassin also uses a headset as an assassination tool.  This film also featured exploding milk bottles.  The way Koskov escapes from East Germany is excellent for at least a couple of reasons, including the use of a Harrier vertical takeoff jet.  In general the special effects were well done and believable.There are a few moments where I noticed some scene glitches.  It appeared that in the final scenes of the movie that there were places where the four-engine C-130 Bond was flying had two engines.  In another scene in the plane Bond looks out the left window and we see fuel leaking from a tank.  However, the bullet holes are on the opposite side of the tank from the window.  Perhaps Bond also has x-ray eyes.  In yet another scene Kara drives a jeep up the ramp of the C-130, which is impossible due to the configuration of the C-130's ramps.  However, these minor errors can be forgiven as the quality of the rest of the movie is excellent.This two-disk set includes a massive array of features, many of which are interesting, some of which are not.  I tend to find these features valuable, but then again I have watched these movies many, many times.Keeping with the trend of having current musical artists perform the title song, A-Ha sings "Living Daylights."  A-Ha was popular in Europe at the time, and had a huge hit in the United States with "Take on Me."Enjoy!

$review_text.: The episodes on this disc definitely fall into the category of sex and science-fiction, but they're by no means the sexiest Outer Limits episodes when you consider the many episodes that comprise the shows' history.Particularly during the earlier seasons there were some very sexy/sensual stories, but either the guys in charge of compliling this dvd decided it wouldn't sell well with mostly early episodes, or perhaps to keep them for other themed dvd's (because they centred on aliens, for example). But whatever the reason, it unfortunatley makes this compilation feel like below-average Outer Limits. And that's a shame, because while these episodes focus more on sex than anything else, they are very often short on plot and not as intense as the Outer Limits can be when at the top of its' game. So in the end, this offers mild titilation at best.

$review_text.: With the recent rash of zombie movies popping up recently, it seems only fitting that someone come up with a zombie spoof.  And Shaun of the Dead hits the bullseye.  The situations that the characters find themselves in are very real-world.  You'll find yourself saying "That looks like something stupid I would have done".  Being trapped inside a car with a zombie because the locks are child-proof is a great scenario.  You and your friends will be talking about the different scenes for weeks.  If the emotional parts were cut out and the movie were a little more "spoofier" I would give it 5 stars.  But regardless, this is a great movie.  I can't wait to watch it again.
$SUMMARY.: Worth watching a few times

$review_text.: (Please read all my review & not stop at the end of the first two sentances if you disagree with my support of Israel) At first I was a bit shy buying this movie, I believe in the cause of Israel & its divine right to exist. I am extreemly careful about anything that would bring the Jewish people and the nation of Israel into disrepute or partake of anything that even resembles anti Semitism - there was something about this movie that intrigued me, I am so glad it did. This movie will move you, its ending is something that the viewer would never expect and without spoiling it for anyone, make sure that anyone prone to expressions of tearful emotions has a generous supply of tissues handy. In saying that, it is a movie that either gender can watch and very much enjoy; the acting is well above par with no well 'Known' actors involved and those in it do an excellent job. Shot on location in the Middle East they story highlights the misery that both sides of the conflict endure - though I am unashamedly pro-Israeli, I do not deny the suffering that the Arab peoples of this land suffer and this movie fairly and accuratly converys the suffering that both sides experience. This is not so much a 'them' and 'us' conflict story parse that we often see on the TV news most nights, even though that is what is indicated on the DVD cover, it is at a completly different level. It is a movie that the Directors and Producers have managed to avoid the common rhetoric of this most painful conflict and remind us that it is the individuals that count, not the politics, and how the most brutal of wars or conflicts cannot keep the most tender of hearts apart, even when they come from opposite sides of the spectrum.

$review_text.: Two Oscar winners Adrien Brody and Forest Whitaker are in this suspense movie about the "experiment," in which ordinary people selected by some "researchers" have to live in a small mock prison for two weeks


Of the twenty-six applicants who passed the test (watching some video) and the interview, five men (including Whitaker's character Barris) are to play the "guards" while the remaining twenty-one (including Brody's character Travis) become the "prisoners."Before the experiment begins, the participants are informed about the rules for the experiment


One important thing is that the "prisoners" must obey the "guards," even in this mock prison


The experiment begins and soon confrontations arise, with some of the "guards" who take their roles very seriously.This is supposed to be a psychological thriller, but not many actions of the characters are really convincing

The premise is interesting, but what ensues looks mostly contrived or predictable


One of the "prisoners" becomes sick; one "guard" turns out very sadistic; and so on

Acting of the leads is just OK, though overacting Forest Whitaker repeating "Toilet!" with grimace is unintentionally funny

Supporting players including Clifton Collins Jr
and Maggie Grace (as Travis' girlfriend) did decent jobs, though most of the characters they play are underwritten, even unnecessary."The Experiment," an American remake of a 2001 German thriller "Das Experiment" is, not surprisingly, directed by the "Prison Break" creator Paul Scheuring
As you know, the original German version directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel is inspired by Stanford Prison Experiment, which I believe did not end in this way.Interestingly, for the remake Paul Scheuring has added a new idea to the original storyline: "a red lamp" that shows the termination of the experiment
I see the point the filmmakers are trying to make (obedience to the authorities, abuse of power, etc.), but the presence (or absence) of the red light in the film only lessens the credibility of the story, making the whole situation unbelievable.With 'guilty pleasure' written all over it, "The Experience" is yet another unnecessary remake

It is watchable, but not as good as the original.

$review_text.: This film, especially the beginning, reminds me so much of the best of Fellini. The sights and sounds wash over the viewer, and pull him along. Hard to say what Fellini might have done with CGI, and a decent budget, but I think it would have been something like this. One can look for symbolism, and find it, or just go along for the ride, and have a great time.So many films start off with promise, but have no pay off. This film delivers, if you have patience.

$REVIEW.: "Spy Games" is  full of danger and demands quick thinking on the part of the stars.  It is a story about CIA operative Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) who is mentoring Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) on the challenges and uncertainty of spy games.  The games are real and deadly as they travel the world from Vietnam to Berlin to Beirut to China.  They are respectful of each other and although they have their differences, there is a deep moral friendship developed as they spent years working together.  It has not always been smooth, and sometimes there has been resentment and hurt feelings, but they have been through much together and they are soul brothers.Nathan Muir is ready to retire, in fact, it is his last day and he has packed his office belongings.  His superiors want to know information about Tom Bishop and all of a sudden all of Muir's "feelers" go up.  He learns that Bishop has gone rogue and is trying to rescue his lost love in a Chinese prison.  Bishop was arrested and jailed in Beijing on espionage charges attempting to break in and save his true love.All of a sudden the last 24 hours of Muir's career are full of heart throbbing suspense, sacrifice and fast thinking.The movie is well done, although some of the chase and rescue scenes were far-fetched.

$review_text.: I enjoy watching zombie movies and I'd heard a lot about this one before I managed to get my hands on a copy. Some people had told me it was a classic of low budget filmmaking, others had warned me it was an absolute steaming pile of zombie pap. Now, having finally watched it, I don't think it's either of these things.The acting is bland in general, with the exception of veteran British actor Richard Johnson (looking a bit out of place, but having a great time hamming it up as the slightly mad Dr. Menard) and smirky Roger Moore look-alike Ian McCulloch. Al Cliver isn't too bad as a tough-guy tourist caught up in the zombie infestation, Tisa Farrow (yes, that's Mia's little sis) drifts through much of the movie looking distant and dazed, and Auretta Gay (they must have given her a hard time at school) takes her top off a lot but spends the rest of the time either over- or under-acting.The plot isn't much to speak of but it holds the attention, and considering the directors other horror movies, it's a miracle there actually is one. The ending annoyingly blunts any disturbing edge the film may have built up towards the end, and drags the movie fully into the realm of cheesiness. The lack of enough real tension and suspense among the pumping blood, punctured eyeballs and blazing gunfire is pretty disappointing too. That said, the action scenes are genuinely exciting (despite being kinda slow in coming) and the climatic sequence in Dr. Menard's hospital with the invading zombies vs. humans is quite enjoyable.Overall,  I found that all this was not quite as horrifying as reputation suggests, probably because of it's age, lack of tension, or my stamina to being scared/disgusted. The memorable parts a battle between a zombie and a shark, and a graphic tracheotomy, (to name just two) easily make it worth the rental, plus some good special effects really caught my interest. Just don't expect much intelligence here that you'd find in Romero's undead flicks. On the whole, it's not brilliant, but it fits respectfully in this genre.

$REVIEW.: This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.  Part of its appeal lies in its originality and simplicity.  Jeff (played by James Stewart) is an injured photographer who's confined to a wheelchair in his apartment.  The story revolves around the things he sees from his window as he's spying on his neighbors.  Binoculars in hand, Jeff looks at what everyone's doing and knows a lot about each of their lives.He begins to suspect his neighbor of murdering his wife, and a number of things happen that seem to support that hypothesis.  He investigates, and gets both his girlfriend (played by Grace Kelly) and his nurse to help him.Directing was an art for Hitchcock, and his ability is showcased marvelously in this thriller.  Using just the apartment building for a set, Hitchcock creates an aura of suspense and uncertainty that will keep you involved throughout the movie.The acting in this movie is superb, and its story is interesting, all the way to the final climax involving the helpless Jeff.  This is a movie that definitely deserves to be on AFIs top 100 list.

The character of Don Draper/Dick Whitman is so well developed that I find myself just trying to read between the lines of his torment.

$REVIEW.: *** This comment may contain spoilers ***Before I watched the Michael Radford's movie, I read the play "The Merchant of Venice". I did not find the play one of Shakespeare's best - I much prefer his tragedies and historical chronics. Perhaps whatever was funny and comical four hundreds years ago does not seem this way now."Merchant of Venice" is based on three different stories - one is the story of three caskets - a girl should marry a man who would solve the riddle of three caskets, the gold, the silver, and the lead one (very weak premises - with many suitors, the secret of the caskets should have been solved in the first day); the next - the story of the merchant who loans the money for his friend from a rich Jewish moneylender and signs the contract that he would give a pound of his own flesh if the debt is not repaid in time (the most interesting and controversial one), and the last one - the story of the rings. While I think that the play is enjoyable, it's got too many holes in the plot to be called an outstanding Shakespeare's work. What is truly outstanding - Shylock's character. He is in the same category as Lear, Yago, and Othello. I am sure that Shakespeare did not write an anti -Semitic play but he described the anti-Semitic views that reigned in the society during his times. He treated Shylock as a human being and with the compassion, which he expressed in the famous Shylock's monologues:"Shylock: He hath disgraced me, and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew.""Shylock: I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that."By refusing to show the mercy, Shylock orchestrated his own downfall. It is unspeakable that he was spat on by a seemingly decent man but demanding that man's flesh is equally unspeakable. I think that's the reason Shylock was outsmarted at the court and had to lose his case because, technically, Portia's reasons were weak - if Shylock was entitled to the pound of flesh, he was also entitled to the blood that comes with it. To argue that would be the same as to say that one buys an apple but refuses to take the seeds in it or to rent a room but without air in it. What was different in the play comparing to the movie, in the play, we don't see Shylock after the trial - whatever happened to him is behind the scene. In the film, he's got a long shot - after he had to leave his house and convert to Christianity, he became a real pariah - Christians don't want him because he did not become a Christian by his good will and Jews don't want him because he betrayed the faith of his ancestors. And don't forget that his own flesh and blood, his beloved daughter Jessica betrayed and robbed him. The look at Shylock's (Al Pachino's) face in the end of the film is one of the reasons to see it. It is a nice looking movie with one compelling performance (Pachino) and one surprisingly pleasant performance - Lynn Collins who looked like a young Cate Blanchette and delivered her line convincingly. I liked her intelligent, gentle, and full of life Portia. The celebrated Venice known as "serenissima" looked mostly dark and dangerous which I think was rather appropriate because of the disturbing scenes that took place in the city.3.5/5

$REVIEW.: Actor Director and acclaimed Shakespearean Kenneth Branagh has accomplished a very unlikely movie about an unemployed actor director who organizes and directs an unlikely cast, at an unlikely location at an unlikely season , with less than no budget a Christmas, fund raiser production of Hamlet. Just like this first sentence, none of this should work.It does.A Midwinter's Tale is not light humor. You will have to have some knowledge of Hamlet as well as some sense of the business of theater. Much of it is very insider even more of the movie is warm.This is ensemble cast work. That is, I was totally taken in by the interaction between cast members, yet there are individual moments created by individual actors. That is, my every thought about this movie is riddled with contradictions. Point is that I enjoyed it.Joan Collins plays basically the same kind of character she usually plays, but her every scene is a small jewel of smarmy evil.One simple view of the sign announcing that Hamlet will open on Christmas Eve, was way more funny than can be explained.Michael Maloney as the leading man, actor director does a lovely portrayal of how to direct weak performers and handily holds the center of the incompetent yet ultimately capable cast. Again contradictions....The scenes from the opening night abound with sight gags, sounds gags and humorous surprises. I suggest it is worth the entire movie just to enjoy these scenes. On the other hand there are charming and touching and fun scenes throughout the movie - and still more contradiction.My one enduring thought is this: A Midwinter's Tale should be a failure and little more than an ego boost for Keneth Branagh. I liked it. This movie is improbable, but it is more than just entertaining.

$REVIEW.: Black Adder stars Rowan Atkinson, an absolute comic genius who is also the star of Mr. Bean.  The screenplays were written by Richard Curtis (Mr. Bean, Not the nine o'clock news) and Ben Elton - possibly one of the funniest modern writers.In the forth series, Rowan Atkinson plays a cynical army captain, famous for his slaughter of peaceful pygmies using only sharpened fruit.The six episodes in the series are:1. Captain Cook - rather than help move General Haig's liquor cabinent six inches closer to Berlin, Black Adder tries out as the company artist2. Corporal Punishment - a delicious plump breasted pigeon gets Black Adder a visit with a firing squad3. Major Star - rather than try his luck with German Snipers, Black Adder tries out for vaudeville.  Things look promising until the General Melchett falls for the female impersonator4. Private Plane - Lord Flash is back and women are falling over everywhere.  Why doesn't Flash wear underpants?  hasn't been a pair made that can handle the job.5. General Hospital - A beautiful nurse, a patient with a strong german accent and three weeks in the hospital.  Will Black Adder ever find the Kaiser's spy?6. Goodbyeee - the final end.  Will Edmund manage to avoid the "big push" with a "wibble" or is it curtain call

$review_text.: I was never a big fan of the original 70's movie
It was slow, mostly uneventful with so-so acting and not much horror for my tastes


Many felt it was more of a psychological film and created its scares through that, but I never felt that movie ever rose to that kind of terror
Hearing about this remake I was interested but figured it would probably be close to the original, and therefore not very interesting to me


Once I saw the preview though and after finding out is was made in part by the writer and producer of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, I wanted to see it


And I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed.The movie follows a family, the Lutz's, as they move into a new house for a sorid past
A year early the son of the previous owners went a little crazy because of the hauntings and voices in his head, and systematically went from room to room shooting his parents and four siblings in the head with a rifle
The father George(Ryan Reynolds) is married to a woman with three children from a previous marriage and none of the kids have really taken to him yet
Reynolds who must will remember from Nation Lampoon's Van Wilder and most recently Blade Trinity does an excellent job in his role


This is far from a comedic performance and Reynolds shows he does have some acting chops.From his first day in the house George is constantly cold and early on the house begins to weigh down on him
He hears creaking, radios that aren't plugged in


The boat house keeps getting unlocked and the dog won't stop bothering him
Soon he's freaking out at the kids and losing his cool with his wife as he quickly spirals down into his own personnel hell created by the house and its past

The youngest daughter meanwhile meets a new friend, the ghost Jody who was the youngest sibling murdered a year before

She's a fairly nice ghost when the bad man of the house isn't making her do bad things.Soon the daughter is fully envolved with the ghost and George is chopping wood like a madman to keep himself warm, as well as sleeping down in the basement where he thinks the only warm place is

He's also hearing more voices and piecing together the ugly past the house has

Meanwhile the mother is trying to keep her family together as best she can, although it doesn't work that well


It all leads up to an entertaing ending where George starts seeing demons in his family and we learn what really happened at the house when it was first built

It ends with a crazy George trying to hack up his family in The Shinning style as they try and escape him and the possesed house.The acting is very well done in this movie and it has several decent scares


There's a great scene with a not so smart babysitter and the priest who tries to help the family out


And yes the fly scene with the priest is in here, and its still good


The movie builds up the scares through great pacing and an entertaining story

It's about in the middle when it comes to the gore, not to much but not too little either
The ghosts look great too and I found this film much more enjoyable than the original as well as current films like the Ring 2 and The Grudge


I reccomend going and seeing this great film right away.

$REVIEW.: werner herzog is a difficult director and he doesn't let the audience off easy
 while a film like 'aguirre' is enjoyable on a surface level films like 'dwarves' require further thought


 when i first saw this film i wasn't really into it but after listening to the commentary, seeing a few more of herzog's films and reading a book about him i appreciate what he is doing
 the images and ideas that werner herzog commits to film are from a special place and anyone who has heard of the fantastic stories surrounding the production of a film like "fitzcaraldo" can see herzog's devotion to his art


 in a profession filled with creativity and eccentricity herzog towers above all as a true oddity

 this reputation has resulted in his ability to make films that are far from digestible for over 30 years


 his talent and powerful personality make him worthy of attention and appreciation.

$review_text.: Guarding TessScore: 71/100Guarding Tess is an unexpected and cheery film that has a strong power to be able to mix comedic situations and dramatically emotional scripting. That's quite a plausible thing about this movie, and the rest of it enjoyable too. Even though it lets itself down a couple of times, Guarding Tess is still enjoyable none-the-less, and will appeal to many audiences.Doug (Nicolas Cage) is a Secret Service Agent who has just completed his stint in charge protecting Tess Carlisle (Shirley MacLaine), widow of a former U.S. President, and close personal friend of the President. He finds that she has requested that he not be rotated but instead return to be her permanent detail. Doug is crushed. He wants off her detail. She is very difficult to guard and makes her detail crazy with her whims and demands. Doug returns with no idea of how to continue dealing with her.Guarding Tess has most of the things to please a willing audience: an original and effective story, 2 pitch-perfect performances from Nicolas Cage and Shirley MacLaine, some intriguing realistic situations and bright reviews from the critics. I found all of these things to be very impressive facts about the movie, especially the storyline, which dreams up tonnes of ideas as to why Tess should be a pain. The characters are original and you can relate to some of the messes they get into, especially the Doug's craziness of wanting to get away from Tess and do some real Secret Service work. There are a few flaws that stop the movie from being as stunning as their 2 main performers. The comedy never really hits the spot as well as it should. Sure, there are a couple of unashamed giggles, but with a premise so neat, you should expect laughs-out-loud and a lot of them. The film also could've ended better, but you'll still have a good time, guaranteed.Guarding Tess is a good and old-fashioned movie that has a strong mind to please it's audience. And it does, with charm and style.

$REVIEW.: melodramanoun1. a dramatic form that does not observe the laws of cause and effect and that exaggerates emotion and emphasizes plot or action at the expense of characterization.Unfortunately, I use the term pejoratively.With a main character so relentlessly pathetic, meek and neurotic, I found my sympathy quickly transitioning to frustration and then boredom.  What little psychological tension existed by the film's end was extinguished when subtlety was abandoned and the symbolism become grotesque, absurd and ultimately, silly.But then again, I did get to see Natalie Portman in a most satisfyingly intimate fashion, so, it wasn't all bad.

$REVIEW.: I can't believe this movie has 4 stars let alone people actually seriously giving it 5 stars.  This set of movies is probably the most terrible series you can buy.  It starts at number 2 and closes the series but they left out the only one worthy of about 3 stars.  Ever since the first it went downhill from a mediocre horror movie right into the slums of just ghastly horrible movies.  Disapointing, don't buy these movies if your life depends on it, they're terrible and so are the actors in them.  Just look at the first one, the mom is the mom of the kids in that show 7th Heaven, give me a break.

$review_text.: What you have here is the bare bones of the story, stripped of just about everything not central to the Lipwig/Dearheart interaction

I can imagine someone saying "but we have to get down to what the story is about" in some planning meeting.So, Ankh-Morpork has no dwarfs or trolls in this story
You don't see nary a one trundling by


In fact the only non humans you see are the golems.I tell a lie

You get to see a poorly realized banshee (and a less-believable creature I have not seen outside of an episode of Doctor Who in a year of budget restrictions), and you get to see Otto Chriek, except you don't really, because he takes flash photographs without so much as a murmer of protest


Luckily, they don't affect him at all - so why bother making him a vampire at all in a production where money was obviously shaved off wherever possible? The whole point is lost.And you get to see Angua in all her glory, far too much and far too long
You are in no doubt, nor is anyone else, who the Watch's werewolf is within ten minutes of the show starting.Nobody smokes except for the love interest Dearheart, and she only does it as an indicator as to how far she has fallen and to enable a heavy-handed anti-tobacco message to be delivered (almost everyone interesting on the Disc smokes, and usually the most disreputable roll-your-owns into the bargain)
I gave up smoking years ago but even I felt this was going far too far

PC has no place on the disc, surely?Most grievously, the reason for the post office's demise is not even referred to, and we get no glimpse of BS Johnson's wonderful sorter.Close on its heels we don't get to see the marvelous ride to Genua (Uberwald in the movie) on the magic-assisted cart.In short, there was no reason to stick the label "Discworld" on this show at all, other than to fool people into buying it

Even reacher Gilt's parrot was excised in the interest of...f*ck knows.The story is interesting in its own right, and is quite brilliantly told by a stellar cast, which is why it gets three stars


It is OK.Just OK.'Cos it ain't a Discworld story any more

$review_text.: Ma and Pa Kettle, Volume 2Betty MacDonald wrote the book "The Egg & I" about her experiences as a chicken farmer in Washington state. This was turned into a Hollywood movie that had "Ma and Pa Kettle" as comic characters. They were popular enough to lead to a series of movies until their audience diminished. These movies were often shown on broadcast TV in the 1950s and early 1960s. Viewing them after five decades you see them as low-budget comedies. How do they compare to the TV comedies of that era, or today? In those days egg producing was a small family-owned business. A local middleman (like Billy Reed) would buy the eggs and transport them to town for marketing. Chickens would be placed into small cages and transported to a local store that would sell them "dressed or undressed".One interesting part is the culture and outlook from these stories. Note the familiarity with firearms. It was never turned into a TV series, unless it inspired "Green Acres". Do you know how eggs and chickens are produced today? When was the last time you saw live chickens for sale? These movies are now as obsolete as the popular Westerns of the 1930s-1940s, or the detective movies of the 1940s ("film noir"). There were two other movies made later with a replacement for "Pa Kettle".Volume 1 has four movies on one double-sided disc."The Egg and I" (1947);"The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle" (1949);"Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town" (1949);"Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm" (1951).Volume 2 has four movies on two single-sided discs."Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair" (1951);"Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation" (1953);"Ma and Pa Kettle at Home" (1954);"Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki" (1955).In the interest of comedy I would like to suggest a final movie to end this series: "Ma and Pa Kettle Go to the Big House". Government officials became curious about the expensive travels of the Kettle family. Their investigation showed no unusual buying pattern of items that could be used for moonshine. A visual inspection found a plot of land that had green-leaved plants and a drying shed hidden behind their hen-house. Arrests followed. Ma and Pa Kettle retained the services of the famous trial lawyer firm Dewey, Cheatham, & Howe. They were able to get a reduced sentence. Afterwards the Kettles moved to another state (some said Idaho). Some said they suspected why Pa was so relaxed and laid-back.

$REVIEW.: As a satire this movie was hugely entertaining.  Some of the plot developments were so implausible that they might have fit well into one of Shakespeare's own plays quite nicely, and I strongly suspect that the screenwriters were quite deliberate in this regard.  They also quite ruthlessly maul history when it serves their purposes --- something also to which the Bard could well relate.  The dialogue & the storyline cruise along at a wonderful pace.  Only when Will & Viola stand around getting all dreamy-eyed over each other does the movie begin to move into some dangerously cheesy territory.But the cheesiness is kept more or less in check.  Judi Dench & Geoffery Rush turn in great supporting performances.  Colin Firth is wonderfully reptilian and one-dimensional a perfect Shakespearian villain (like Don John, for example) in many ways.  Even Ben Affleck seems moderately competent and appears capable of acting; the movie probably deserves an award simply for managing to pull that off.Did this movie deserve 7 Oscars?  It is hard to argue that it did, because despite the great writing it is still a rather lightweight romantic comedy at its core.  However, it is a lot of fun to watch and may tempt some people actually to read up on their Shakespeare (and possibly their Marlowe as well).  It is hard to find fault in that.

$review_text.: Ok, when I was reading books years ago, I found time to read Eragon and it I loved it to pieces in the same way with the Harry Potter series. I even read the books that followed after that, Eldest and Brisingr. My problem with this movie is, in terms of adapting a succesfull book, its just lazy. It barely takes time to fully flesh out the story like the book did after the opening. We barely get to know the characters that exist here.The story follows into Alagaesia as its called, about a young man named Eragon who unintentionally finds a blue stone containing a dragon, and soon finds himself in a whirlwind of Dragon Riders, Elves, Dwarves(at least elves and dwarves were suppose to be in the movie), and an army consisting of the major elements ready to oppose an evil king.I won't lie. I did like the cast selected to be in this, but despite that: I still hated this movie. Its a real shame that Christopher Paolini sold out his work like this for it to become a movie, and for this to become an hour-and-a-half long disaster. The acting wasn't terrible at all. The bad dialogue was the major issue and the movie was playing away like it didnt care about the story. In terms of directing, the movie certainly does not lack for visual flair, but the another problem is the movie felt incomplete. The reason its getting an extra star from me is my thanx does go to the cast who attempted to bring this life, but this movie is a prime example of how Hollywood has so much money to sometimes take something like the book Eragon, break it, and just give us something they think we wanna see.

$review_text.: This is a good giallo flick from Italy and Luigi Cozzi,who went on to direct some decent (for their very low budget) science fiction movies in the 1980's
 It is heavily influenced by Alfred Hitchcock and a story from the tv show: "dario argentos 'door into darkness"  in which the director helmed a episode

 This isn't the typical black gloved unknown killer flick instead it's a straightforward thriller in whick a man blackmails a serial killer into killing off his wife


Then the killer must chase down a couple who steal his car with the body in the background


The Michel Antoine, who plays the killer is perfect in his role as is theexcellent George Hilton as the crooked husband


He is a underrated actor who excelled at every genre he attempted including westerns in the 1960's

 The photography is first class and the rest of the cast makes this seem like a higher budget movie than it was


This isn't a great giallo  but it is a good one and the print looks great
Mondo macabre delivers with this one and puts other companies to shame for their shoddy prints they fling out at us

 One can only hope they go after the many hundreds of giallo flicks that have yet to be released anywhere on dvd

 Lets hope Luigi Cozzi comes out of retirement to direct another thriller someday as the Italians have totally given up on sci fi

 They can still give us great thrillers though as they don't cost that much to make in comparison.

$REVIEW.: I begged Mark Arnold and Shout! that they not use DNR/DVNR way back when Underdog was first announced. It nearly destroyed the Underdog set and has succeeded in Killing Tennesse and Chumly!  Heavy handed  DNR/DVNR was used on this set and the effects are crap. I've never seen a case where it made anything look better regardless of issues that exist on the source material. DVNR has nearly ruined this set. Very disappointing!The folks at Shout! should talk to Dennis Rood's [the master!] crew at image who did Twilight Zone DVD and Blu-Ray for they are true professionals who do some of the industry's best mastering/transfer to digital work.1 Star - Why did they drown this in DNR/DVNR which is never needed and never makes anything truly look better. Why wasn't the original theme audio used it was present as an extra so if does exist. I don't min lower quality if that's all that exists what I do mind is revisionism and DNR/DVNR to try to make something look modern when it isn't.Given those involved I had high hopes for this set which were crushed by the result. Unlike Tennessee this set from Shout! has failed. All involved should be ashamed of themselves!To quote Michelle S."Visually, the cartoons are quite colorful. However, each and every cartoon on this set (and the Underdog set too) suffers from very heavy-handed use of DVNR (digital video noise reduction).(For those who don't know what DVNR is, it's a process companies use to remove film grain when they "restore" old footage. (For some reason, producers must think that film grain is inherently "bad".))The problem when DVNR is overused - like it was here - details and lines (especially black lines on a white background) are often obliterated. When shots are over-processed, small things (like Chumley's whiskers, or the lines that make up Tennessee's eyes) are nearly processed away, and occasionally entire shots are ruined. (Towards the end of "Tell-Tale Telegraph" all that's left of the black telegraph wires is a series of jagged broken lines.)"Edit: For those who are thumb's downing this review have you really looked at the picture on this set. If you are somehow actually happy with the result then congrats I'm sure Mr MacMillan will be glad to churn out more of the same cheap shoddy amateurish transfers/masterings.

Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) as he is stabbed and thrown into the Saigon river

 During the 1950s when the French were protecting their colonial Vietnam, Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine), a British reporter meets the young quiet American, Dr

Pyle, in Saigon
 Dr

Pyle is an idealist that believes that he can help cure the Vietnamese of glaucoma when he meets Phuong (Hai Yen), Mr

Fowler's mistress


 Dr

Pyle falls in love at first sight, and seeks Mr


Fowlers approval of his pursuit for Phuong
 In the middle of this love triangle the communists are stepping up their attacks against the French colonial empire and the French also lose control of one of their officers as he is rising his own army for the Vietnamese people
 These fractions all seem to merge with Mr

Fowler, Dr
Pyle, and Phuong

 The Quiet American is a cynical love story set in a highly explosive environment where the setting is affecting the characters choices as well as their actions


 The brilliant cast supports the intricate story that is enhanced by Noyce's directorial touch as it takes form on the screen, which in the end offers a terrific cinematic experience.

$REVIEW.: Groucho Marx was great at thinking on his feet, and his caustic humor could always get laughs. Whether he was using puns or ribbing his guests, Groucho was at his best on You Bet Your Life, his quiz show that asked contestants trivia questions from predetermined categories in order to win money.Guests ranged from kooky citizens with interesting stories, like the hitch-hiker who wore a military uniform to gain drivers' trust and a sweet blonde who modeled herself after Marilyn Monroe, to full-fledged celebrities. Harpo Marx made an appearance on this show to promote his autobiography, but he didn't utter a word. Johnny Weissmuller let out his famous Tarzan yell.Each episode is interesting and entertaining; they encapsulate an era gone by. Although we still have quiz shows, we don't have personalities like Groucho Marx who is the glue that holds this show together. He has chemistry with everyone in one way or another and makes this a fine DVD set.

I also have purchased the new Nikita series in BD so it's a little difficult to give an unbiased review after watching the new Nikita so I won't.All I want to know is if the Fifth Season of La Femme Nikita has a Confidential Information Insert.  Seasons 1,2,3, and 4 have a confidential pamphlet which gives more detail to each of the episodes.  The fifth season did not have one included; or the one I received did not.  I wish it did as the confidential Information gives a lot of added details such as the name of the writer, director, and original airdate, along with a synopsis of each episode and information about the cancelled scenes.  This is one of the nicer inserts that I have seen and I would repurchase the fifth season if I could be sure that it includes the confidential information.To conclude this non review, LFN is a four and a half year roller coaster ride with excitement and intrigue around every bend, dip, and corner.  I just wish the fifth season had been a full season.  Perhaps this is the reason for the deleted CI Report.

 Quite a number of absurdities (next time Captain Picard decides to ram a Romulan warship head-on he should remind the crew to fasten their seatbelts).The biggest problem for me was the bad guys just weren't bad enough


 Considering how the Enterprise destroyed the Borg almost single-handedly, it's hard to take a pack of Romulan-Reman renegades seriously

The social commentary and character developement were fantastic, making the original Dawn the seminal zombie flick of it's time.  While I'm not a fan of "shot by shot" remakes of films, sticking a bit closer to the original would have pulled my rating up from four to five stars.That is pretty much the only place the remake falters though.  The action is nice and fast paced, the zombie makeup was great and (I'm going to generate some negative votes with this statement) I liked the fast zombies.  By applying the logic that all reanimated dead creatures would be lumbering, shuffling, mindless automatons you close the possibility of fast paced exciting zombie, vampire and mummy flicks as well.  If one can suspend one's disbelief to the point where a little girl can return from the dead and crave human flesh, the fact that same can run down a hallway should not prove too much of a leap of faith.I liken the new Dawn of the Dead to Steven Sommer's first Mummy flick.  An exciting, fast paced, popcorn reinterpretation of a classic sub-genre.  Besides, good box office for a remake of a Romero film can't get in the way of him getting the go ahead on his next picture.  Romero devotees might benefit from that particular revelation.Did I mention the fast pace?

$review_text.: What a wonderful collection of videos from such a special artist
This is the newest version of Volumen with all of Bjork's music videos, along with two new ones from her Best Of album


 The night vision photography on "It's In Our Hands" makes Bjork look particularly youthful and vibrant (yes, even for her)

 I'm trying to think which ones on here are not quite as artistically masterful as the others, but I'm pretty much at a loss
 Watching this all the way through puts me in a perpetual state of bliss and wonderment.My only complaint is that the video mastering doesn't seem very consistent in spots


The brightness and hue levels seem to be slightly different between several of the shorts
"It's Oh So Quiet" is extremely out of wack, with contrast levels that aren't correct at all


 I know the aperture of the lens was stopped down for the down tempo moments in the piece and then back up for the chorus each time, but the overall settings are very hot and overly saturated like the telecine to digital transfer was all off, or something


 I have a Muchmusic Spotlight collection on VHS and it actually looks more natural on the tape than on this DVD


I also don't recall my DVD, which just arrived a few days ago, having a PAL side

I'm wondering if I received a discontinued first issue of the 2003 version of Volumen

Possibly these quirks have been fixed
 Maybe the rest of you can let me know.The sound quality is first rate, though, really showing off what kind of extension and transparency the lowly Dolby Digital is capable of


 The more I hear of DTS the more I think Spielberg just wanted his own standard he wouldn't have to pay licensing fees for
 Does every DTS disk have the bass boosted just to fool us into thinking it's more extended in the nether regions?  And to those who have asked why all the videos are not in 5.1: it's because Vespertine was mixed in 5.1 for its high-end format DVD-Audio release in Europe


 So essentially you are getting the best version of each song on this collection
 They didn't specially mix any of the tracks for this DVD, and I would neither expect nor want them to.

$review_text.: There was really no need for another release, and I hope I'm not the only one who's getting sick of stupid re-releases of DVDs already out, with just one extra bit on them. It's not necessary. Apart from this, I've already seen a 15th anniversary edition of Pretty Woman, fabulous, unless you already own the 10th anniversary edition.Much as I love this film, if you already own the previous DVD, then there's no point buying this. If you haven't seen the film, or haven't bought the DVD already, maybe thinking about buying it for a member of your family, for Christmas, then sure, go for it.OK, there's a few more extras on this, than the previous release. On this one, you have: commentaries by director Robert Wise, Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Charmian Carr, choreographer Dee Dee Wood, and Johannes Von Trapp; introduction by Julie Andrews on both discs; separate chapter list for songs only with Play All feature; English, French, and Spanish sing-a-long subtitles; A Few of My Favorite Things: A retrospective documentary; Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer: A Reminiscence; Charmian Carr on location with The Sound of Music from Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion; When You Know the Notes to Sing: A Sing-Along Phenomenon; Biography: The Von Trapp Family--Harmony and Discord; Restoration comparison; storyboard gallery; behind-the-scenes stills; lobby cards and one-sheets; screen test: Mia Farrow; and Trailers and TV spots: Theatrical teaser, Theatrical trailer, 1st Anniversary trailer, Academy Award trailer, 1973 reissue trailer, testimonial trailer, TV trailer.On the old edition you have: Original 1965 documentary Salzburg Sight and Sound (14 minutes); making of documentary The Sound of Music: From Fact to Phenomenon with cast interviews, rare music outtakes, photos and more! (87 minutes); audio supplement by Ernest Lehman; audio Interviews with Julie Andrews and Robert Wise; DVD-ROM games and links to fan site; storyboards, sketches, production stills and theatrical trailers, radio and TV spots.OK, so there's more on the new release, but do you really want to pay for it, when you're probably not that interested in watching the extras? I wouldn't. And as for the singalong bit, with the words going across the bottom of the screen, if you've seen the film enough times, then you'll already know the words off by heart! Or is that just me!I suggest you only buy this if you haven't already got the DVD. If you have, there's really no point.

All I can add is that I scream at my 55" Large Screen TV "Go Secretariat, Go!" and cry like a sap every time I hear Penny yell "Let'em run Ronnie, let'em run" and see that horse make the last turn on his path to victory and history at the Belmont Stakes.  I mean every time.I called my girlfriend and briefly discussed the film with her.  A major stoic, she said that she cries too and I asked her why?  Before she had an opportunity to respond I said "Perhaps it's because we witness something perfect of heroic proportions doing something it was designed by God to do flawlessly with all of its heart and being."  All she could do is agree.Thank you Disney for this wonderful film in spite of any literary license you may have taken to get the point across.

$review_text.: I just finished watching all 30 episodes of Gomer Pyle Season 3 and can report happily that all the episodes, with one possible exception are complete. In Season 2 at least 2 of Gomer's songs were cut. In Season 3 there are 2 episodes that require Gomer to sing and all those songs are included. Those are "Love's Old Sweet Song" where he sings to Lou-Ann Poovie and "Sing A Song Of Papa" where he sings for the gangster nightclub owner. However, there is one episode "To Re-Enlist Or Not To Re-Enlist" that is questionable. There is a scene with Sgt. Carter and Cpl. Boyle discussing Gomer's upcoming re-enlistment. Then, cut to Gomer and his fellow Marines in the barracks talking about whether they will all re-enlist. In this scene Gomer is holding a guitar. Did he just finish a song that was cut? This episode is also the shortest with a running time of 24:02.  I don't know why all of Gomer's other songs would be included and just one just song cut from this one episode, so I'm guessing this episode is also complete. But, can anybody confirm from memory or a bootleg DVD or VHS tape if this episode is complete?  Also, all 3 of the episodes that feature Lou-Ann Poovie have her songs included which strengthens the case for Season 3 being complete with no cut songs.

$REVIEW.: This was one of the very first westerns I ever saw as a kid, so it has a certain amount of nostalgia for me.The story is excellent &amp; McQueen portrays his morally ambiguous character, out for revenge against the men who murdered his parents, with sensitivity.  We see that he slowly becomes like the killers he's after, living only for vengeance, walking away from one potential love interest &amp; losing the respect of another while she dies from a snake-bite.  (This one was played by Suzanne Pleshette.)  We sympathize with him, but he's no hero.  He participates in robberies &amp; associates with killers in his quest, so in that sense, as another reviewer stated, this is the beginning of the &quot;modern western.&quot;Other reviewers, however, have also missed out on another intersting aspect of this film.  It's a pre-quel.  Most viewers don't realize this.  &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot;, written as a novel by Harrold Robbins &amp; released almost two years before &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; was a huge hit back in the '60's.  That film starred George Peppard as a millionaire tycoon &amp; Alan Ladd as his close friend &amp; mentor.  Peppard's character, &quot;Jonas Cord Jr.&quot;, is really a fictionalized Howard Hughes.  His father (and namesake) had gone insane &amp; Cord The 2nd lives in fear of turning out like his father.  So much so, that he becomes so ambitious in his quest for wealth, becoming both an aviation industrialist &amp; a film-producer (just like his real-life counterpart, Howard Hughes), that he turns away from any &amp; all real, meaningful relationships.  His best friend, Alan Ladd's character, saves &quot;Cord&quot; from himself, by making him face what he's become.  This character, portrayed by Alan Ladd, is a cowboy/western film-star during the early days of Hollywood &amp; is a top billing star in &quot;Cord's&quot; (Peppard's) movie-studio.  He knows how a single-minded obsession can destroy ones' humanity because he himself had gone through it as a young man, growing up in the Wild West.....You guessed it.  Alan Ladd's character is &quot;Nevada Smith&quot;, the very same character portrayed by Steve McQueen in the movie of the same name.  If you watch &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; &amp; &quot;Nevada Smith&quot;, then you can really enjoy the characters more, seeing their backgrounds &amp; how they came to be.  In &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; it is Jonas Cord (Sr.) (portrayed by Brian Keith) who teaches McQueen's character how to fight.  This relationship gives us the reason why the Alan Ladd character (&quot;Nevada Smith&quot; as an old man) is so devoted to Peppard's Jonas Cord Jr.  It also shows how relationships &amp; behaviors repeat themselves.Both movies are classics.  Both movies are also somewhat dated (&quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; could be re-done today &amp; improved upon, as a mini-series on tv while &quot;Nevada Smith&quot;, though excellent, does contain some historical innaccuracies which today's westerns would never allow), but the writing, the characters, the direction, &amp; the acting in both films are still good enough to hold up to today's audiences.

$review_text.: Not very interesting for the first half of the movie at all.  Honestly the characters could have all died and I wouldn't have cared because I hadn't bonded much with them.  I did not want Hugh Laurie's character to die because well it's Hugh Laurie.  But then it picked up with building the plane and engaged me quite a bit, enough to make up for the beginning.  It's an okay movie overall.  A decent way to pass the time. I'd recommend it if you're quite bored, otherwise skip it.

$review_text.: "The Matrix Revolutions", the last in the Wachowski brothers' super sci-fi trilogy, is a mixed bag of criticism.  Most of us already know what everybody else thinks based upon the surprisingly low opening weekend box office of $48.5 million that the film barely scraped, a direct reflection upon the consensus of  the "Matrix Reloaded" back in May of `03.  That's right, folks - for those who were disappointed with "Reloaded", "Revolutions" will only upset your expectations even further.  For those who eat up every fat morsel that the film industry serves up piping hot from the griddle of hype (the teaser trailers in combination with the cheeky Powerade TV ads), you'll love it pound for gluttonous pound.The remainder of this now flaccid storyline has Zion up crap creek without a paddle, their firepower no match for the hundreds upon thousands of Sentinels about to breach the core of the city.  There is something afoot in the Matrix as well - the malicious Agent Smith (Weaving) has proliferated himself throughout the entire system and is more than prepared for a final confrontation with Neo (Reeves).  However, Neo is preoccupied with what measures must be taken to ensure the safety and survival of Zion whilst Trinity (Moss) ever-faithfully prepares herself to accompany him on his most perilous mission yet.As exciting as this apocalyptic final chapter sounds, you know you've lost something when the story completely overwhelms the characters.  Neo, Trinity and Morpheus used to be some pretty damned interesting folks.  In the film that began it all, Neo was introduced as a cocksure novice who slowly but surely realizes his true potential.  Trinity was a strong and admirable yin to Neo's yang, a woman equipped with a lethal combination of beauty and brains.  Morpheus was a wise but humble seeker of truth, a teacher not abject to learning from others.Where the hell did these people go?They were killed off by one deadly mechanism: FRANCHISE.  This was the point at which art was sacrificed for profit and the Wachowskis lost themselves in the high-tech impressionism of computer graphics imaging.  What started as a fantastic premise full of possibilities has resorted to eye-candy for the action movie catalog, a by-product of overzealous marketing.Aside from this noticeable change in the scheme of things is another inexplicable move - the film's grandiose conclusion.  Many people will be baffled as well as fuming, the ending leaving more questions with nothing to provide any answers.  The most significant resulting quandary is why some of us chose to spend nine dollars on over two hours of visual excess only to be swindled by a cryptic ending.  Sorry to say that the entertainment industry has suckered the lot of us once again.Let's face it - the only real fun to be had here is by the actors and you gotta hand it to Hugo Weaving - he's successfully managed to find himself a character in which he can completely indulge in all its salacious evil.  The bad guys always seem to have more fun in overwrought productions such as this and Weaving is clearly having a blast as Smith, cackling and smirking to the hilt while his markedly arched eyebrows and piercing blue eyes consume the screen.Reeves, on the other hand, puts no more energy into his acting than what's required and let's face it - there isn't much of a requisite for emotion.  His designer wardrobe, stylish shades and killer moves are the real showcase and Reeves excels at this but nothing more.  Moss retains her cool surface as does Fishburne, along with Pinkett-Smith as the resolute Niobe.  Don't expect much to change; these are repeat performances, after all.  Mary Alice joins the cast as the Oracle and the presence of a new face in a familiar role is only a bittersweet reminder of Gloria Stuart's passing (a vague explanation was written into the script for why the Oracle appears physically different).Bottom line: If you're just dying to know how it all ends, go ahead and spend the few bucks to rent it.  Just don't expect to be illuminated or amused by it all (or to get your money back!).

$review_text.: "Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull" is excellent! This is how the story goes: In 1957, Indiana Jones is thrust back in action, venturing into the jungles of South America in a race against Soviet agents to find the mystical Crystal Skull. The cast led by Harrison Ford (returning in his signature role as Indiana Jones) is excellent! The directing by Steven Spielberg (who also directed the first 3 Indiana Jones films (1981, 1984, 1989) is excellent! The story (which is based on characters by George Lucas & Philip Kaufman) by Lucas (who also wrote the stories and screenplays to the "Star Wars" series and "Indiana Jones" movies) & Jeff Nathanson (who also wrote the screenplay to "Catch Me If You Can" (2002) & "The Terminal" (2004) and the screenplay by David Koepp (who also wrote the screenplay to "War Of The Worlds" (2005), "Spider-Man" (2002), "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (1997), & "Jurassic Park" (1993) is excellent! The music by John Williams (who also did the music to all 3 Indiana Jones movies and many of Spielberg's other movies) is excellent! The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski (who has done the cinematography to Spielberg's films since "Schindler's List" (1993) is excellent! The film editing by Michael Kahn (who also did the film editing to all 3 Indiana Jones movies and many of Spielberg's other movies) is excellent! The casting by Debra Zane (who also did the casting to "War Of The Worlds", "The Terminal", & "Catch Me If You Can") is excellent! The production design by Guy Hendrix Dyas (who also did the production design to "X2" (2003) & "Superman Returns" (2006) is excellent! The art direction by Luke Freeborn (who also did the art direction to the upcoming "Star Trek" (2009), Lawrence A. Hubbs (who also did the art direction to "Superman Returns"), Mark W. Mansbridge, Lauren E. Polizzi (who also did the art direction to "The Lost World: Jurassic Park"), & Troy Sizemore (who also did the art direction to the upcoming "Terminator 4" (2009) is excellent! The set decoration by Larry Dias (who also did the set decoration to "Transformers" (2007) & Alyssa Winter is excellent! The costume design by Mary Zophres (who also did the costume design to "Catch Me If You Can" & "The Terminal") is excellent! This is an excellent return after 19 years of absence. Ford is back and still in great shape to play Indy. This is just as great as the last 2 Indiana Jones films in the franchise. This is also one of the best films of the summer so far.

Brandon Lee did an excellent job, exuding angst, pain and revenge in this chilling tale. It's amazing to see how the remaining scenes were completed, and most of the film had already been shot when Mr. Lee was accidentally killed. Great movie. Could have bwwn longer, though, with additional scenes showing how Eric and Shelley came to care for Sarah and how Shelley & Eric met. This movie also reminds us that "Buildings burn and people die, but real love is forever." Should have been rated PG-13.

Barry has seen how his mother had to struggle for years with a man that she did not love. After Barry's father is dead, Barry's mother is finally able to marry the man she has always loved.Barry's reaction to his mother's fate and also to his own relationship with his father, makes Barry afraid to form a steady relationship with the woman of his dreams.This film touches important issues like love, committment and religion.

$REVIEW.: These movies are fantastic.....NOT ONLY because of the awesome special effects and fantastic music and intense battles.  So many wonderful values are shown in these movies......courage, friendship, love, loyalty, and so many others.  You can get inspired from the awesome friendships in these films--Frodo and Sam; Bilbo and Gandalf; Aragorn and Arwen; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli; Gandalf and the four hobbits; Boromir and Faramir; Elrond and Arwen, and many others.  The characters fight their wars because they choose to do so in order to protect what they love--unlike other fighting movies like Resident Evil and Kill Bill, where idiots just run around killing mindlessly and blood sprays everywhere from beginning titles to closing credits.There are so many scenes that totally summarize the war, fantastic places and creatures, friendship and other things that LOTR is about--The Rohirrim coming to Gondor's aid, charging heroically to Minas Tirith; the breathtaking battles at Helm's Deep, Minas Tirith, the Black Gates, and awesome combat at Amon Hen; the gorgeous scenery (mountains, plains, Hobbiton, Minas Tirith, Fangorn); the intense scenes with the trolls, the insane race down the Stairs of Khazad-dum as the Balrog pursues the Fellowship; the Balrog and Gandalf battling on the Bridge and on Zirakzigil; the Ents in battle and all the fantastically done scenes with the Nazgul; all the scenes with Arwen thinking of Aragorn's fate, with the haunting music....the relationship between Boromir, his brother, and his father; Sam and Frodo; Aragorn's strange past and more.Good stuff, people!  Yes, these DVD's are very well made, with hours and hours of special documentaries.....you've heard it all.  Behind the scenes that are so detailed it's crazy--no other DVD's have every been this detailed.So that's that.

$REVIEW.: Full disclosure...I am a KISS fan.That being said, this concert DVD from Paul Stanley's "Live to Win" tour contains some of the best renditions of classic KISS tunes that I've ever heard - both cover versions, originals, and various live lineups.The band sounds amazingly tight (they completely nail "Hide Your Heart") and it's clear they're having a blast playing.The prologue at the beginning is a bit boring and overlong to someone very familiar with Paul and his career, but it would be modestly interesting to someone totally new to him and his music - though I'm sure the core audience would be existing fans anyway.The video quality is superb.  Although I don't care for rapid camera/angle changes (and there are plenty here), they don't distract very much.  The picture is crisp and colorful.Sound quality is just as good, and DTS and Dolby Stereo are options.The DVD insert is 10 pages of well-printed photographs of various performances on the tour and the set list/track listing.  I would have liked to have seen more in the way of liner notes...not just Paul's own thoughts but the bands' as well.  Paul's said plenty about the KISS material already, though notes on the Live to Win stuff would have made a nice read.As others have said, there are no bonus features - just sound format options and the ability to jump to a specific song.  A featurette or two would have been nice. Rehearsal footage...the usual concert DVD extra stuff.  Lack of extras is the only thing keeping this from five stars.

$review_text.: I am thankful to Turner Classic Movies (TCM) channel for screening this rare occult film. I say rare because one can hardly find it on DVD unless one is willing to pay an exorbitant amount for it. I wish this film would be made available on DVD, preferably on Blu-Ray, as it is one of the most visually-appealing and highly atmospheric occult films I've ever watched. I read that Christopher Lee considers his role in this film as one of his favorite performances and it isn't difficult to see why. Lee's performance here is not as his usual villain role, but as a titled nobleman, the Duc de Richleau, who is determined on saving the son of his deceased friend from falling victim to a Satanic cult led by the diabolical Mocata (a chilling performance by Charles Gray)."The Devil Rides Out" (1968, also known as "The Devil's Bride" in the US) centers on Mocata and his cult of devil worshipers who are intent on inducting two young initiates into their cult, the young Simon Aron (Patrick Mower) and the beautiful Tanith Carlisle (Nike Arrighi). Luckily for the young people, the Duc de Richleau (Lee) is on to Mocata's nefarious plan, and together with his friend, Rex (Leon Greene) , the pair come up with a plan to foil Mocata's attempts.The movie is visually stunning (in fact I was very impressed by the crisp quality of the film awash in brilliant color, almost as if I was watching a Blu-Ray), and the audio is crystal clear. There are many depictions of the dark arts in this film and occult references abound, but rather than cheesy dialogue which I've come to expect in some of these older horror movies, the dialogue was intelligent, elevating the quality of this production to that of a cerebral occult thriller. Lee's character spouts his lines so convincingly the viewer could almost believe whatever he says as being the absolute truth. The role of the good guy is credibly portrayed by Lee and complements the villain role so aptly played by Charles Gray as the evil Mocata whose piercing stare can chill one right to the bone.There are some genuinely creepy and suspenseful moments in this film and the pacing never lets up, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. I enjoyed watching the plot unfold, and the occult references are well-integrated into the storyline. The production qualities may seem dated and the effects a little tame by today's standards, but the overall impression is one of an artistic and atmospheric film which makes for compelling viewing. This certainly counts as one of the finest offerings by Hammer Films.

$review_text.: I  watching this movie years ago on cable and I remembered it as being quite funny from beginning to end. I must have been high. Granted, it is funny in spots,and there are some excellent performances by all members of his family, especially Vincent D'Onofrio as his brother. The strange thing is, now this movie is also an excellent example of how alcoholism can tear apart a family. I know what you're think, how is this funny? If you remember the Stuart Smalley bit that Al Franken did on SNL, that routine is used as just a rough framework for the movie. The real story of the movie is how Stuart deals with the alcoholism that is slowly (and literally) killing his brother and his father. This movie portrays alcohol addiction probably better than most movies that start out to seriously portray this addiction but then inevitably get sidetracked by smarmy soap opera-ish subplots. Stuart is himself a mental wreck and then to have him thrown into the fray whereas he has to try to save everyone in his family makes for a fairly interesting, and sometimes quite funny, movie.  It's not a great movie, especially the ending, but it is worth a couple of hours of your time.

$REVIEW.: This picture reminded me of a time when newly graduated from high school I tried to put myself through college by taking the SAT exams for younger students.  If they wanted to get into some place great I'd try to get brilliant scores, if they wanted to get into community college I'd answer badly.  It would be rather fun except it was a little bit nerve wracking, and I stopped my activities when one girl in the classroom recognized me under my true identity and nearly jobbed me as a bad lot.  Whew, I can still feel the relief.  I don't think you could do this today, I expect every single person, even the young, has some sort of picture ID, or maybe they use DNA evidence, but back then you basically just out your social security card on the desk and the proctors might give it a look but usually they just whisked by like runway models, looking neither sideways nor down.In EXAM the young people are not trying to get into top schools but rather they're sitting for an exam in which the top applicant will win a job with a faceless corporation.  It didn't seem likely to us, but then they explained that the world had been invaded with a killer disease and that this company a) gave top people great medical insurance and b) actually were this close to a cure.  In th4 closed set of the exam room, it all seems far away, and thus when the eight people are all revealed to have enough motive to do just about anything to stay in the game, it makes sense, well, up to a certain point.  I'm afraid the low budget of the production limits its plausibility.  We never get a sense of the outside world, and the characters, who absurdly use not their own names but they answer to names like "Black," "White" and "Brown" bestowed on them by a chav, come across like they think they're in some Guy Ritchie remake of The Usual Suspects.  Or is it like Glengarry Glen Ross, mixed with a little bit of Reservoir Dogs, but with much cuter guys.  There's nothing original about EXAM in the least, but Jimi Mistry, Luke Mabry and Chuk Iwuji are all entertaining in their brown, white and black ways.  The girls, not so much.  Two of them are among the worst actresses I've ever seen in an actual movie, you think it's some kind of reality show but it's not, they're supposed to be edgy young British talent.  Well, I shouldn't be harsh, I'm just warning you, this movie has A aspirations but D-level performances, and the writing is ludicrous, once you realize that the whole ninety minutes folks are going to think about what you could do with a sheet of white paper short of ruining it.  Everything we thought of, no matter how silly, the characters then proposed and tried it out.  "Let's give the weak one a paper cut with it!"  Done.

$review_text.: these movies are not as good as the universal monsters series but are fun if you aren't in too serious a mood. In the Aztec Mummy, researchers have to deal with arch criminal "The Bat" along with the Mummy who is just trying to keep tomb raiders from messing with a sacred Aztec temple.The mummy then has to deal with others looking to steal the Aztec gold and other interlopers in the subsequent featues. He isn't really scary looking,so don't expect too much along those lines Not included in this Mummy Marathon is "AZ vs the Wrestling Women'. But three south of the border thrillers should hold you. Best viewed with tongue in cheek and brew in hand.

$review_text.: The DVD itself is fantastic and is a collector's item. These older horror films are enjoyable, and this is the kind of story that I find worthwhile. Picture is very good, and the sound is fine, with a dark, menacing score by Moroder, and a color palette that is both sensual and troubling.Schrader's version of this story, though, is intellectually aloof and not without passion. His camera seems to be more in love with Irena than with the plot details (not that this is a bad thing, as the original film's Simone Simon was also a knockout), and this leads to an overwhelming sense of voyeurism as opposed to a complete investigation of the film's characters. The film has been accused of being pornographic, but that's not a fair criticism, as we've seen much worse elsewhere. I don't really think this film was trying to be offensive in any way, despite the scenes of sexuality and nudity. So, in sum, not Schrader's best moment but, as with Universal's current DVD release of &#34;Dracula&#34; (1979), this is a keeper of a DVD. Whether or not you find it better than the Lewton version is insignificant because this film is both fun and disturbing in its own way, and not truly a contribution to the horror genre as it is academically defined. B+

$REVIEW.: Wow! What a movie.  We have come to expect the weird and wonderful from director Tim Burton, and with Big Fish he did not disappoint us.  Perhaps, this film is the best Burton has done to date- it is a weird and wonderful tale about a Father and Son, life and death and alienation and reconciliation.It is a story of Edward Bloom, masterfully played by both Albert Finney (as the elderly Bloom) and Ewan McGregor (as the younger Bloom).  You just never know where this movie is going, what is true or false.  Blooms son, Will (played by Billy Crudup) resents the time that his father spent away from home on business, he sees his fathers tall tales as a barrier to intimacy between father and son.  As an adult child Will comes home when he learns that he father is dying and attempts to discover the truth behind the tales, thinking that the truth will bring reconciliation and intimacy between father and son.  He believes that his fathers absence and tall tales were a ruse to hid a hidden life, perhaps even another family.  He cannot believe that a man who told such tales, and who was absent so much of the time could have loved his family the way he said he did. What he does discover is that sometimes the tale is better than the truth.  His father lived a mundane life as a salesmen, but in the midst of everyday life, touched the lives of hundreds of people.I was touched by the love story that supported the plot between Bloom and his wife (played by Jessica Lange).  It was good to see Lange act in an older plot.  Nothing is sadder than watching a middle aged actor trying to play the part of a young person.  One could sense the impending loss, as Bloom lay dying, that this marriage was coming to an end and each party was trying to come to grips with the inevitable conclusion of life- death.Yes, this movie deals with death, but it is a funny, engaging, touching, and both weird and wonderful.  If you are looking for an evenings entertainment, this movie is for you.

$review_text.: In a sense, my wife and I already have these episodes of Keenen Ivory Wayan's furiously funny Fox Network productions of In Living Color. Mainly because when the programs originally showed we thought that ILC was so risk taking back then, we just knew the networks were going to have trouble with showing anything like this, so we video taped them.  So really, we haven't been without Homey D., Fire Marshall Bill or Hey Mon or any of the Fly Girls steppin' since. One thing one notices, though, at the beggining of each how shy Keenen appears to be for being such a world class comic performer. Also, there are skits with the Men on Films guys that I wonder would pass by censors today. Anyway, now that the DVD collection is out, we are gonna be sure to collect our pennies in order to purchase this great comedy show. Our tapes are getting pretty worn out, besides. Also, as an aside, one is gonna be hardpressed to find any of Eddie Murphy's PJs out anywhere--Trio network does them every now and then. And we try to catch those on tape also...

$REVIEW.: Prodigal Son is about two-thirds of one of the best kung fu movies ever made. From the film's opening up through the arson and slaughter at the traveling Chinese opera troupe encampment (sorry about that spoiler), the story (about a spoiled kung fu wannabe and his very reluctant teacher) is involving and the action is crisp. The martial arts choreography, which accurately depicts the effective Wing Chun style of kung fu, sets a new standard for the genre. However, when director Sammo Hung makes his entrance as historical kung fu figure Wong Wah Bo in mid-film, the movie veers sharply and awkwardly into comedy and then falls flat. Prodigal Son bounces back a bit in the final reel for the obligatory showdown but with the marvelous actor Lam Ching-Ying having already taken an earlier exit, the film doesn't fully recover. However, Lam's performance as the historical Wing Chun master Leung Yee Tai and his spot-on fight scenes are just enough to earn Prodigal Son a five star recommendation.Note: I strongly recommend watching this and any other Chinese films in the original Cantonese soundtrack (with English subtitles). English language dubbing is distracting and greatly detracts from the experience of viewing a good foreign film like this one.

$review_text.: Meryl Streep portrays an inflexible nun, dedicated to the job of keeping things the way they've always been, and staying fully in charge of the school and convent which she leads.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is a priest with great compassion for his parishioners, and especially for a young altar boy whose father beats him on a regular basis.  Streep's character chooses this very compassion to challenge the priest and, using an incident reported by another nun, she works to discredit him and banish him from the parish.  Streep and Hoffman are wonderful actors and without their performances this would have been a much less powerful movie.  My husband and I had diametrically opposed views of what the truth was in the gray areas of the film, which says to me that it was a wonderful springboard for discussion.  I did feel that it was a little slow at times and that there should have been more proof for Streep's character to act as she did.

$REVIEW.: This is a standard-issue children's movie.  It treads carefully around significant issues:  family grief, social welfare bureaucracy, nurture vs. nature.  The result is that young viewers can begin to examine such weighty &quot;adult&quot; matters in an accessible, non-threatening venue.Lilo and her older sister-forced-to-be-mother, Nani, play their roles admirably.  Lilo is a precocious, but socially inept young girl, struggling with her parents' absence, and the rejection of fellow classmates.  Nani must fill the roles of mother, father, provider, and big sister/friend.  At the same time, she needs a job, and suffers the unspoken frustration of not being able to care for her own needs and wants.The alien characters are funny, but harder to empathize with.  Even stitch only becomes loveable in the last 15 minutes of the movie.Overall, this is a somewhat uneven production.  Nevertheless it is worthwhile for its content and the acting of its human characters.

$REVIEW.: As much as Ben Stiller liked playing cops and robbers and pretending to be Starsky as a kid, he shouldn't have bothered acting in this movie, neither should have Todd Phillips bothered with his lame jokes and meandering plot.This dumb-downed remake has nothing in common with the series(that ran from 1975-79)except for the clothes and the car.Neither character portrayed here was similiar to Glaser's & Soul's roles (Ben Stiller had to wear a wig!!)and the jokesseemed to make more fun OF the series rather than being funny.The original series Starsky & Hutch was a crime drama that at times, didn't take itself too seriously, but tackled hard-hittingsubjects in it's day.To make a spoof or parody and the inevitable exploitaion of a series that still has a large fan base isdisappointing.It is worth mentioning that the originals Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul have a small cameo at the end of this movie.Buy the first season of Starsky & Hutch on DVD instead for action and drama, with a little comedy mixed in.

It was made to make us laugh (with the well written script) and jump out of our skin (with the even better directed scenes). Sure Paul Walker can seem to be surfer like, but I feel he has been pigeon holed after the Fast &amp; the Furious. Overall he did an outstanding job.But from the minute this movie started you knew it was going to be rough going for Walker and Co. (Sobieski and Zahn) I would not give 5 stars due to the mostly predictable movie plot line (except for the ending) But it was fun watching it. And thats what movies are all about....FUN....right?And how fun is it to call your best buddy late at night, or in the case of yours truely, laying in bed late at night with your loved one after a hard days work and suddenly call out with that deep scratchy voice....&quot;Candycane&quot;!

It just doesn't compare to The Naked Gun movies, etc. It just feels like this movie reaches too far sometimes. It definitely has its moments, but it is not consistent. I'll watch this movie over and over again because I really enjoy it, but I give it 3 stars simply because I love Nielsen's other stuff so much more. This movie has some pretty cheesy stuff in it, and that is saying a lot for a Leslie Nielson movie. This movie is funny, but others are much funnier.

$review_text.: As a longtime "Mystery Science Theater 3000" fan buying the Film Crew releases is an easy decision. Like many others I miss the silhouettes in the corner, and generally find the host segments to be weaker than MST3K due to the loss of tension between the imprisoned filmgoers and the mad scientists. Despite these relatively minor critiques, I still enjoyed the film, and hope for many future Film Crew releases.The film itself is an early horror film starring Peter Graves against aliens and the military industrial leadership. Given the era, it's obvious that nuclear energy plays a key role in the film, hilariously represented here by either stock footage of very lame special effects. While I like Peter Graves, in this he is totally wooden, which makes him an easy target for skewering. Obviously Graves is eventually vindicated in a climactic scene that is as humorous as it is ludicrous.This isn't my favorite B-movie, but it is a classic of the genre, and the Film Crew do an admirable job on the commentary track. I recommend this release to any MST3K fan, any fan of comedy, or any fan of B-movies from the black and white era.

$review_text.: SOME HISTORICAL SPOILERSMarshall Bill Tilghman was an honorable anachronism

Born in 1854, he had been a buffalo hunter, an Indian fighter, a State Senator, and a lawman of the Old West, the intimate of such legendary men as Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Doc Holliday, Wild Bill Hickock, and Theodore Roosevelt
He had broken the Wild Bunch and the Dalton Gang, had been at the OK Corral and in Dodge City, and had lived long enough to see the West tamed


Flivvers replaced horses, electric lights replaced oil lamps, running water replaced hand pumps, and there was, as a character in the film says, "rolled crapping paper."At seventy, an age when most of his compadres were dead and gone, Tilghman was asked by the Governor of Oklahoma to bring order to the town of Cromwell
In 1924, Cromwell was a dishonorable anachronism

Despite the flivvers and the electric lights, the running water and the rolled crapping paper, Cromwell was a lawless oil boomtown loaded with saloons, brothels, and gunslingers, a ramshackle town with unpaved streets full of mud, oil and horse manure, under the control of wealthy oilmen who supplied the populace with illegal White Lightning, Prohibition bathtub gin, and a loaded cocaine and morphine mixture that kept everybody over the age of 21 dangerously tweaked and working robotically, rather like methamphetamine does today.The gravel-voiced, mustachioed, rangy, flinty-eyed Sam Elliott plays the straight-talking Tilghman to a fine turn in this TNT made-for-TV movie

Elliott's Tilghman lives on an isolated ranch near Chandler, Oklahoma with his young wife and two young sons whom he adores

His preferred transportation is the horse
His house is lit with hurricane lamps


He wears a gun belt with a six shooter


He is definitely a Nineteenth Century man

Tilghman knows this


He even wrote, produced and directed a classic Western silent, THE PASSING OF THE OKLAHOMA OUTLAWS in 1915 to counteract the false mythology that Hollywood was beginning to build around gunfighters of the Old West

"The one good thing about outlaws," he says, is that they're "dumber than stinkbugs most of them."Regardless of his old-fashioned ways, he has horse sense, and he begins to chip away at the crime that has devoured the town


He soon finds himself at odds with corrupt FBI Agent Wiley Lynn (Arliss Howard), bootlegger, drugrunner, wetbrain and addict, who is using his Federal badge to line his pockets and feed his habits
Although Lynn warns Tilghman to get out of town, Tilghman sees Lynn as just another punk with a ride and a gun, albeit a Model T and a "Chicago Piano."The Cromwell incident reached its climax on Halloween Night 1924, when Wiley Lynn, in the company of the town's best-known Madam, Rose Lutke, began to shoot up the town


Tilghman seemingly successfully disarmed him, but was unprepared when Lynn pulled a small caliber pistol from a pocket and shot him several times at pointblank range

Wiley Lynn fled in Lutze's car
Bill Tilghman died in the early hours of November 1st.YOU KNOW MY NAME is a true period piece, spanning that imperceptible wink of historical time when the horseriding lawmen and outlaws of the Old West coexisted with the automobile driving policemen and gangsters of the Prohibition Era


This overlap was both very brief and was limited to only a few locales, like roughnecking Cromwell, Oklahoma
And as unromantic as the 19th Century outlaw was in truth, the 20th Century gangster was even less so


The damage wrought by Organized Crime's bootlegging and illicit drug trade has far exceeded anything the bankrobbing, cattle rustling bandanna-wearing Western badmen ever accomplished.As an historical afterword, Wiley Lynn was tried for the murder but was unbelievably acquitted when most of the witnesses against him failed to testify---a few were never seen again after the incident

In what amounts to a sorry statement on the true state of Hoover's FBI in those years, Lynn got to keep his badge and gun, though his habits only worsened

On July 17, 1932, the corrupt, wasted Lynn was killed in a shootout after he opened fire on another Agent.As for Cromwell, it suffered a fate it deserved


Enraged that the famed Tilghman had been killed, members of the Ku Klux Klan burned Cromwell to the ground in December of 1924
Although the town was rebuilt, it never resumed its wild-and-woolly ways


Modern Cromwell is today a lost backwater with less than 275 residents and a colorful history.Sam Elliott brings Bill Tilghman back to life, showing us that there are heroes amongst us  whatever we may believe.

Such verisimiltude would fall to political correctness nowadays. Brilliant script that uses character development to make the film. Both Buttermaker and the Bears grow, but in a gradual way. This patience is evinced in the Bears' new winning ways, which comes slowly and thus gains believablity. A funny and poingnant classic that was the precursor to all those &quot;Mighty Duck&quot; films as well as that &quot;Hardball&quot; flick.By the way, skip the sequels. They stink.

$REVIEW.: What attracted me first to this series was Nathan Fillion; ever since seeing him inFirefly - The Complete SeriesandSerenity (Widescreen Edition), I have followed him with great interest


 While this is your typical "buddy" cop show, what makes it work is the visible chemistry on screen; not only do he and Stana Katic remind me of the early years ofMoonlighting - Seasons 1 & 2, but I also like the relationships he has with his mother and daughter; with each one, he is a different person, and he pulls it off very well

 If you didn't see it when it aired, give this one a chance.

$review_text.: This film tells the story of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 60's from within The White House.Brilliantly acted by the 3 main leads (once you get over Costners irritating voice - which I assume was accurate), the film is a very interesting look at the 13 days that nearly changed the face of the world we live in now.  Its interesting to see exactly how close 'we' came to nuclear war.Only a couple of criticisms of the film is that (for me) the tension didn't build. Thats partly because we 'know' the end result, however i feel it could still have been cranked up a bit.  And it would seem everytime the director introduces another historical figure, it all goes black and white???  The first time this happened, I assumed my dvd was faulty.As for accuracy - who knows, Hollywood has a knack for 'exaggeration' during historical retellings, and it did feel a little 'too' pro-US (the Russians cant have been COMPLETELY to blame surely?) but either way, this is a very interesting, well acted and enjoyable movie.

$review_text.: Blood and gore, especially large quantities, have never been my personal taste for a good movie, but I must admit that this film did have a lot of the factors that it takes to make a good horror picture
The unstoppable  Freddie Krueger is again haunting the dreams of children, and the dreams  begin to turn into reality for those plagued by them
One by one, they  begin to fall victim to Freddie, until Nancy, the survivor of the first  saga, begins to stop himfrom killing off the children
Not a bad movie in a  long line of klunker films.

$review_text.: This movie is awesome.  I saw it on Turner Classic Movies and fell in love with it instantly.  The settings are beautiful, and the settings involving witches and demons are chilling and scary.  Like Nosferatu, this movie continues to be scary even to this day.  The costumes design for the devil is pretty scary.  And the special effects are amazing.  Now this is technically a documentary, but it has sequences that can also make it count as a horror film.  It has great info that I didn't even know at the time until I saw this.  This is actually one of the best horror films I have ever seen.

$review_text.: The story has been well reviewed already. I want to add that the element of faith in this movie is what makes it worthwhile to me. The soldier and the single mom have each been hurt by someone they loved and now, through faith that God has a plan for them, they learn to trust their feelings to another person again. The young boy has also found a man he can look up to and depend on, after being disappointed in the lack of caring shown by his own father. Stephanie Powers plays a woman who has experienced pain in her own past, and though they don't dwell on her situation long, the realization that her mother has been through it all before and still has faith helps Dana be strong.It may be a predictable outcome, but there is substance to the message that makes it more than just another romance.

$REVIEW.: I read every article I can find on Viking culture, history and architecture, etc.  I find the Viking time period and the Scandinavian people of that time simply a fascinating.  I have actually been able to legally buy a few authentic Viking relics, so understand I'm trying to be fair in my rating of this DVD.  I am afraid this review is going to sound like a rant and a Richard Karn bash - I don't mean it that way, but beware!  I wanted to like it - I really did, but I just couldn't.  It was the first segment that completely turned me off; it infuriated me.  I know it shouldn't have but it did.  In fact even though I watched it alone my face was burning.  Less than five minutes into the first segment I was already regretting having bought this DVD.  I was hoping for something truly documentary in nature.  Instead, we get a buffoon for a narrator and a bunch of goofy sound effects and on top of that you see a bunch of idiots dressed up like "Vikings" in obnoxiously fake battle scenes.  One reviewer hit the nail on the head, when he likened these particular Viking scenes to the Key Stone Kops (or Cops, as you prefer) dressed up like Vikings.  Okay, I liked Richard Karn in "Home Improvement," but he was utterly terrible in the narration of the first segment.  I got so sick of hearing his bad jokes, and the sound effects were annoying, tedious, and stupid.  Concerning the first segment; OMG, it's horrible  The other two segments are pretty good actually and you can learn something of the Vikings, their motivations and their conquests in those last two segments, nothing not previously in print or on another documentary but still good information and presented well. I originally gave the DVD a 2 star rating overall because while the last two segments weren't too bad they could not overcome the absurdity of the first segment.  I have reconsidered and up'd the rating to a 3 star.  The last two segments deserve a 4 or 5 star rating.  Perhaps the first segment might be more appropriate for pre-scholars to maybe elementary age school children who have had no other education on the Vikings.
$SUMMARY.: Segment 1 of 3 is so disapppointing

$REVIEW.: ...that this is a "Dawn of DVD" product. That is, it was one of the first films ever released on DVD. I bought this product when it first came out, so I've had it for over ten years. Back in 1999 we were just all awestruck by the fact that a movie would fit on something smaller than a brick (VHS) and might even have room for and contain a featurette. In this case your extra feature is the featurette "Right Here in River City: The Making of Meredith Willson's The Magic Man". There are also two trailers, and that is it.Looking at the film today, this disc is a dinosaur. The colors seem runny and the hue a bit off, and the sound is rather uneven. The disc can often be had for a greatly reduced price, and the quality is probably the reason why. This film is ripe for a redo and most probably a Blu-Ray release, so I would save my money until that time, if I was you.As far as the film itself as art, it is one of the great musical motion pictures. I can't imagine anyone but Robert Preston as fast-talking fast-thinking Professor Harold Hill, and then there's my favorite line in the film as spoken by the mayor "And now I'd like to present a spectacle - my wife." The music is wonderful and memorable, and the whole thing just captures small-town life at the beginning of the twentieth century in such a charming way. I've liked this film since I was in my 20's, back when I thought that "The Terminator" was classic cinema.In summary, I couldn't recommend the film more highly, but as for the DVD I'd wait until Warner Home Video comes out with an upgraded product. One is long overdue.

$REVIEW.: In Season 1, James Spader's character was a smooth pitbull with ethics to match.  He remains a smooth pitbull, but has gradually become an underdog, usually for the wrong side of a liberal argument.  The writing is superb, there's a rapid turnover in second lead characters, lots of sexual innuendo and stuff not so subtle, and don't even ask about the midget.  The cases reflect major conflicts of the time, a Denny Crane (William Shatner) keeps sticking his foot in his mouth). .Shatner can actually act and proves he deserved the Oscar (but, really, here's the headline, the Shat can act!).  I never saw this in first run and can't wait to get through all five seasons, then will undoutedly watch them again.  This is great stuff.

While available on DVD elsewhere, VCI has pieced together some fairly decent prints and done a passable job of restoring these two minor classics. (The fly-by-night prints from the other publishers are terrible, get this VCI version).Tops is Anthony Mann's wonderful retelling of the French Revolution as film noir, with stars Cummings and Dahl doing a wonderful job onscreen.In the Amazing Dr. X a gothic thriller by director Bernard Vorhes, the real star is cinematographer John Alton who struts his pioneering and moody mastery of shadow and light to the fullest extent.The extras, including an interview with Arlend Dahl make this a great package for Noir fans from VCI.

$REVIEW.: Okay, I'm giving this movie 2 stars only because I personally didn't like it very much, but giving it more than 1 star because there were some good things about it, and I'm sure most of you will like this movie more than I did.  I believe this was a foreign film, and like other foreign horror films I have seen, there just isn't much action at all and it seems like nothing really happens until the end of the movie.  It doesn't mean you won't like it, but just in personal taste, I need a little more action.  Not saying it was a BAD movie, it's just too dry for me.  Also, the score to this movie was extremely repetitive, not scary, and perfectly illustrates how important a creepy score is for setting the "mood" in a horror flick.  That just doesn't happen here.  The things I like about the film were that I thought it was well directed, and the gore, while definitely over the top, was effective and fits right in with a zombie movie.  All in all, I don't plan on watching it again, and I would much rather watch Dawn of the Dead than Zombie, I can't wait for the Bells & Whistles Edition of Dawn of the Dead to come out on DVD on 9/7!

$REVIEW.: Marvin Mange is a lowly, unhealthy loser who works as a file clerk at a police station.  He's constantly picked on by senior citizens, obese people, andDr. Cox; he also has the tendency to lose his bowels, which at one point he tooted in front of future girl-toy, a tree-hugger named Rianna. When he received a distress call, he drove to the scenic route until a swerve got him flying across the bottom of the mountain, crashing into rocks along the way.  Although that should've killed him on the first collision, he just got comedically knocked out after several.  He was then discovered by a mad scientist that implanted him animal parts to make him into a superbeing: faster, stronger, sniffier. That's not how it works, but hey, it's here for laughs, right?No.All I'm seeing is Schneider getting himself into another situation to embarrass himself, but now everyone gets hit with the stupid stick. No one seems to be bugged by the fact that he has these weird abilities or the fact that he sniffs butts for drugs; in fact, people in the film ask questions if he can sniff butts out of anyone.  Plus, Rianna somehow became attached to him, which is weird; farts bother her, but him chewing up a worm to regurgitate it on a baby vulture or grabbing a frisbee by his teeth makes him sweet and caring?  This movie has to be written by a child, because it's being treated in an immature state.  It even makes lazy attempts at convenient set-ups, like the whole talking-without-looking-back-at-the-main-character-causing-a-ruckus gag or how Schneider manage to avoid getting fired by saving a kid that just happened to be drowning without any explanation as to how the kid drown in the first place. Oh, and Mange has a black friend who exists to make comments about racism...peachy.  "The Animal" is an acquired taste, a taste for under 12-years-olds or adults with a mind of an adolescent; if you're neither of those things, then consider this animal neutered.

$REVIEW.: Here's a title that doesn't lie - as there are girls; they get naked (mainly topless) and they go dead.However - there's more than meets they eye in this 80's slasher throwback - that had me grinning from ear to ear.For one; the cameos
You have D-grade celebs like Beetlejuice and Sal the Stockbroker (both funny in limited screen-time) alongside a legitimate actor like Al Sapienza (yeah - Mikey from "The Sopranos" is actually in THIS!); plus a handful of Penthouse Pets and porn stars like Ron Jeremy and Ryan Keely - and then for horror/underground fans - the likes of  Linnea Quigley ("Night of the Demons"); Asbestos Felt ("Killing Spree"); Joel D


Wynkoop ("The Uh-Oh Show") - and finally - Nicko McBrain (yes - the drummer from Iron Maiden shows up in this - as a COUNTRY singer! - stay through all the credits)

Did I forget to mention Jerry Lawler is the town sheriff?The next thing I enjoyed was the underlying self-aware element


However - this is not a "Scream" like movie


It literally skewers big and little known films from "Carrie" to a very "Slumber Party Massacre" like entrance from the killer

You should enjoy the (intentional) contrivances in the plot - and self aware elements within (but again - it's not presented as spoof, so whether or not you laugh is up to you)

Upon a 2nd viewing (with the commentary on) I noticed some very interesting subtleties in the story; and an interesting take on organized religion that buried beneath the ridiculousness (this may be the first anti-exploitation/exploitation film I've ever seen).Yes

This is a low budget film

But, surprisingly - the cinematography is gorgeous - and the sound levels are consistent


The special effects make-up are practical (yea!) and the soundtrack actually includes some relatively famous bands (like Hawthorne Heights)

This one compares in production value to the Corman release Massacre movies - in that while it's not going to 2,000 theaters - it's heads and tails above the majority of most modern horror films.Now the down side


This movie will not be for everyone
In fact - it has a relatively select audience
You have to be willing to check your brain at the door and just laugh/with at the movie

I'll admit - it's not perfect; but that's some of the charm

If you can do this - then you'll have a blast


I specifically enjoyed many of the DVD's supplements - including a funny but informative commentary and very tongue-in-cheeck making of
It also has a GREAT interview with Jerry Lawler.Do I recommend this? I do - But not as much as my 5 star rating would imply

That's ONLY for fans of this sub-genre of horror


If you enjoyed Piranha this is it's lower budget cousin and has more in common with titles like "There's Nothing Out There" and "Sorority House Massacre"

Now - if you're idea of fun horror is "Hostel" - skip it

For the money spent, this was better than "Piranha 3DD".I'm not surprised this has been met on many of the horror sites with mixed (love it or hate it) feelings
But one thing is undeniable here - it certainly delivers on it's promise of nudity; gobs of gore and ridiculousness
And for a low budget film like this - what more can you ask? The movie's joke on "Girls Gone Wild" (entitled "Crazy Girls Unlimited") is also quite funny - in a public access sort of way.So - crack open some beers - and spend the evening with some Girls Gone Dead


For any genre enthusiast this movie should come as a pleasant surprise.

$REVIEW.: Great to see a lot of classic TV being released on DVD, and this is no exception.Night Court was one of my favorite shows of the 80's, mostly because it had the zany feel that anything could happen (and frequently did).  However, despite all the zaniness, the characters were real, managing to break through their stereotypes and become genuine people.Of course, Season One isn't really about that (much).  For the most part, we get the strange quirks of the major characters.  Bull is the intimidating behemoth with the heart of gold, although he wouldn't be as dense as he would be in future seasons.Harry Stone is the wacky judge, managing to impress everyone with his unusual way of doing things, and being a fair judge in the process.Dan Fielding is a bit of a snob, and as the first season rolled on, we would see him become more and more of a lech.  This would really dominate his character in later seasons before they toned him down again in an attempt to "mature" his character.And then there is baliff Selma, who manages the crusty role quite nicely, managing to get a quip in that nicely sums up the situation.That was in essence the core of the first two seasons.  Yes, ther was Liz the public defender and Lana the court clerk, but they wouldn't make it to season two.  In fact, Lana didn't even make it to the end of the first season, which was kind of odd, because they never really wrote her out.  How hard would it have been to say that she was rotated out of the court?There are a number of good episodes here although even in the early part of the season there is some repitition (a nut comes into the court clamining to be he/she is something he/she is not, and almost has the gang believing, but even if it isn't true, they still gain something valuable from that person).  Still, we get some delightful interplay among the cast and the various guest stars.  Michael J Fox makes an early appearance here (this was about the same time as Family Ties' first season), and does a decent job as a bitter runaway, quite different from the Alex Keaton role.The extras here are skimpy, but decent.  You get Reinhold on commentary, and a featurrette with Reinhold and Harry Anderson describing the beginnings of the show (much of it covering the same territory).  They praise Larroquette for his physicality, but they never get into the story of why Karen didn't make it past episode 9 or 10.  I would have loved to have seen Markie Post and John Laroquette in on the featurette, or commentary, but perhaps that can come in future seasons.More to come.  I'm waiting for Brent Spiner's first appearance, which I believe is in the third season.

$review_text.: A lazy but imaginative 11-year-old boy in China named Raymond discovers a magical, talking, wish-granting gourd named Bailey in Disney's first Chinese co-production, "The Secret of the Magic Gourd", based on the book by Zhang Tianyi. Raymond sees the enchanted gourd as his easy-ticket through life, and he soon puts Bailey to work helping him catch fish, win swim meets, get into movies, and cheat on his schoolwork. To Raymond's dismay, however, Bailey's help often backfires until he learns to do things for himself and view the gourd as a friend rather than a servant."The Secret of the Magic Gourd" is a colorful family film full of CGI effects and a typical low-budget family film feel. It's a simple fable, and the good points and bad points of the film are easy to pick out. On the bad side, one has a hard time liking Raymond. Until his redemption, he is a pretty crummy kid. Besides that, Bailey the gourd and the other CGI effects look a bit unfinished at times, though this problem is not as frequent as I had anticipated based on things I'd heard. And thirdly, the mishap after mishap course of the film could have done with some more humor or charm as it went through the motions of the fairytale. On the good side, however, there are some fun, imaginative scenes and the overall movie is brightly colored, almost CGI-like itself (though not to the level of something like the recent Speed Racer film), which gives it a visually pleasing quality and helps the weak CGI blend in a bit better. I also can appreciate the simplicity of the story. It's nothing really new, but then again, the cultural aspect makes it different and a simple old fairytale seems rather refreshing nowadays. Overall, it's an entertaining film in a small-scale way and a good start for Disney in this department that I hope they will improve upon (rather than going in the other direction).The DVD is only a single disc, but it has a few bonus features, and one is a lengthy featurette on the film. There are also bloopers, a game, alternate Chinese language tracks, the Fast Play feature, and most enjoyably in my opinion, a music video by an absolutely GORGEOUS singer named Zhang Hanyun (unfortunately, there are no English subtitles for the music video). I find myself giving an extra star for the fine extras of the music video and the making-of featurette, and yes, the DVD is worth buying for the music video alone. Seriously, Zhang Hanyun is jaw-droppingly, stunningly beautiful. But I digress. The film is presented in enhanced widescreen and the English dub features High School Musical's Corbin Bleu as Bailey the Gourd. Personally, I thought he did a fine job with it rather than getting that "Did they have to use a Disney Channel kid?" feeling one might expect. Anyway, pick this one up if you are a fan of the Ghibli films. I'm not saying this is as charming and thoughtful as those, but the visuals and simplicity remind me of some of them, so if you love those you may get a bit of enjoyment from "The Secret of the Magic Gourd". I also suspect this would be a winner with little ones too, but I'm afraid that's something I can't put to the test. Still, what kid doesn't like a story of magical creatures that grant the wishes of children? I know if I could get some wishes out of a gourd, one would be for Zhang Hanyun, ha!

$REVIEW.: This is one of two Steven Seagal movies, from around the same time, that I missed seeing when they first came out, I don't know if there were too many Seagal movies to keep track of at the time, or did they just all sound so familar that I thought I had seen them
Also, at this time Steve was making some of the worst crap of his once glorious career, so I wasn't always first in line to see his new flick, in fact I was becomming somewhat embarressed by the great one, and didn't want to see him in such failures

Well, no mater what the cause, six years later I got a hold of Out of Reach, slaped in the DVD and prepared for the worst

Luckily, it's not his worst, nor anything even close to being good, but as the saying might go, it's not half bad, well actually, a little more than half bad.Seagal stars as a, well I'm not sure, we'll call him a mystery man

He lives in the forest, loves the wildlife, and correspondes with a 13 year-old ploish orphan girl
When she turns 14, she will be carted away from the orphanage, in the care of human traffickers, Seagal gets wind of this, though I'm not sure how, and hops the next plane out


Once in Poland, he must crack skulls, bust limbs, make friends with an orphan pickpocket boy, hook up with a hot Polish policewoman, and duel to the death (with swords) with the bad guy


All in ninety minutes work for Seagal.The action is plentiful enough to keep the movie exiting and the viewer watching

The final battle with villian Matt Schulze, this is the swordfight, is actually fairly awesome


For Seagal die hards, but not necessarily anyone else


It should be noted that this is the first of Seagal's films where a large share of his dialogue has been dubbed by another actor, I don't know if it's just that nobody can due an impression of Seagal, or Sony Home Entertainment just didn't give a flying monkey pooh about it, but these "actors" never sound even remotley like Steve.

$REVIEW.: Denzel Washington happens to be one of my favorite actors. He is just a convincing person in whatever role; whether he be Malcolm X or a dirty cop. He shines again in this one, about an experiment by a Venture capital company into mind control techniques on gulf war veterans.What disturbed me about the story was not that this could be happening (and I don't not doubt it) but that it would be highly improbable to get someone into so high a position in the greatest power on earth. Had they made it at the state level then perhaps that may have had some credibility.Apart from losing touch with reality on that point, I think the rest of the work is fairly well done. It was certainly entertaining and except for that black woman who acts as the FBI officer (Kimberly Elise I think) who in my opinion takes overacting to an extreme (check out the emotional scenes in John Q), the rest of the cast was great.It is a definite thriller, but unfortunately it isn't an unforgettable classic. 3.5 stars from me.

$review_text.: Does anyone have any sauce for this rotted piece of meat I would like to call a film?  It has left this dry taste in my mouth that I feel only some A1 or actual oxen blood would be able to quench.  Seriously, this was one of the worst excuses for a western film that I have seen in a very long time.  I grew up watch the "Duke" with my father and was always impressed with the vast landscape of the uncharted America and the troubles that faces these pioneers on a daily basis.  I expect to see that same quality or better in the westerns that are made today because we have the technology to make them stronger, more entertaining, and powerful, but I guess Texas Rangers decided to go a different route.  They decided to hire a TV director and a bunch of TV stars to help create that sense of reality in the film.  So, instead of seeing Texas through the eyes of the adventuresome, we witnessed Texas through a sound stage in Hollywood as our youth of the WB whimpered in their trailers and thought about the girls of tomorrow.  Who decided on final casting for this film?  I know the Weinsteins were not behind this, or were they?  This was the biggest hurdle to overcome in this film, and while I spent most of my energy on that, I discovered that there were actually more hurdles to follow.  The story coupled with the poor production was another hit to this already devastating picture.Let's talk about the actors that chose to place their names to this picture.  How about I actually start with a quote from Dylan McDermott from the supplemental features of this DVD.  He says something along the lines of, "Material like this doesn't come around everyday, and when it comes to your door, you have to take it because you never know when it will be around again."  Can we be certain he was talking about Texas Rangers?  I wonder how much he was paid for that sound bite.  The material was rated second worst behind the acting in this film.  Anyone with a 4th grade reading skill could see this.  I guess McDermott had someone else reading his work for him.  While I would say that McDermott was the only one holding this film, he continually dropped it on more than one occasion.  His character was decent, but not the greatest hero that I have seen emerge from the Mason-Dixon line.  I think what hurts him the most was that he had to work next to James Van Der Beek, who never felt like a hero to me.  I never really watched Dawson's Creek, but I have this feeling that he brought some of his character from the television show to the film.  It was embarrassing to see him act, especially during his climactic ending that seemed more like amateur night at the local bar instead of acting.  Can we be certain that this wasn't community theater we were witnessing, except with a bigger budget?  The same can be said for Randy Travis, Usher (in a very pathetic role), Kutcher (suffers miserably from miscast syndrome), and Molina (typecast for the paycheck, and it was very obvious in this film).  I think that most were so excited to be working with their friends, that they forgot that this was an actual paying role and they would need to put some work into it.  Even Rachael Leigh Cook was absurd.  Her final speech in the film had me laughing hysterically, and it wasn't intended to be funny in the least bit.  Miner completely miscast this entire film, and it is obvious from the revenue that nobody else was buying it either.With no support from the actors the story was sure to fall, and it did.  There was nothing spectacular or original about the story.  I have even read articles that state that the overall story behind this film was false and very fabricated.  How can you take yourself seriously when you are trying to make a true story from fiction?  Only Charlie Kaufmann could successfully do this and I did not see his name anywhere on the credits.  This was a shoddy piece of workmanship that does not deserve to be called either a "western" or a "adventure" or a "drama".  I would only use the word "junk" to describe what Miner has created.Overall, if you couldn't tell already, I didn't like this film.  From the opening credits until the futile ending it was nothing but pain souring through my eyes and mind as I watched the story unfold.  The ensamble acting proved that you could bring together all the wrong people and create 100% disaster.  Nobody in this film seemed to fit in the least bit.  With the actors completely miscast, the story seemed like wet paper.  Nothing was of any substance.  This was a poor excuse for a film, a poor excuse for history, and a poor excuse to try to appeal to the pre-teen girls of America.  Hopefully we have all learned a lesson from this and can move on without any troubles.  GULP.  I hope...Grade: * out of *****

 Depression.The depression comes from the hackneyed script (also by Estevez)

 Bobby Kennedy is about the only thing that is the tertiary in this film

 Even the clips of him campaigning don't fit in as they could or should


 Let's not forget the historical facts that could have easily been worked into the story are so skewed and just plain made-up it's sad.The acting is bland - for most of the parts

 Is there anyone who said 'no' to a part in the movie?  Oddly enough, Sharon Stone is one of the better people in it - and she is someone I think is normally talentless
 But to be fair - she has little competition:  Lindsay Lohan?  Aston Kutcher? Demi Moore??  Yikes.I didn't buy or rent - I saw it on cable, and the price was way to high.

$REVIEW.: I really wanted to like this movie.  I loved American Beauty, which seems to have created its own sub-genre of suburb drama and discontentment such as weeds, six feet under, and even desperate houswives.  Sam Mendes, who directed American Beauty, is returning to the genre that made him famous, which he established, with a film adaptation of arguably the first work in the genre.  The movie is about how couples and lives grow apart, how we change when we get older, and is done so even more tragicly, that the couple is portrayed by the most famous onscreen couple working today.  The unoffical tag for this movie was a snickering, what would have eventually happened if Jack hadn't died.  But the movie doesn't ever really get working.  As much as I want to like him, Sam Mendes just hasn't done anything substantial since his debut.  I wanted to like Road to Perdition but ultimately it was too distant to connect to, and preachy in its morals of forgiveness.  I did enjoy Jarhead, and thought it was better, but it was kind of empty, and I didn't really think on it again after I was done watching and haven't wanted to watch sense.  This is by far his worst effort.  It never really works except on the frankness of its dialogue on where it attempts to go, and you do have to give it credit for covering this subject matter, but its no longer as controversial as it was when American Beauty came out, and goes nowhere to go up the ante.  I don't suggest that it should merely try to shock us, but I couldn't help but think that I had seen this before, and done better elsewhere.  The characters never seem fully developed, and come off as one dimentional.  I read a couple of reviewers complain that the movie doesn't show enough, that there are too many general concepts thrown around in the movie, and I can understand that to a point.  Usually when that technique is used in film it is because you are about to be shown a lot of information, and the film maker doesn't want to bog down the viewer, but nothing really happens in this.  American Beauty seemed multilayered and this just isn't.  The cenimatography in this film is very well done, and there is a lot of polish, just like in most of Sam's films, but it still leaves you disconnected, and doesn't seem to have a purpose or a focal point for why things are viewed the way that they are.  When in comes to genres, usually one of two things are true: The original work in the genre defines the concept at its most basic element so completely that it demands study, forcing followers to either copy or take in new directions, or just faintly outlines a concept and it is later through different adaptations that you get the seminal work.  I haven't read the book, but from the adaptation here, I have to say the only new concept to movie watchers is the analogy to plain living in suburbs to the conservative era of the 50's model housewife, and the dull and restrictive confines of what society wants for them. The movie looks drab, the characters act drab, its not depressing, as much as boring.  This is shown amazing well in Six Feet Under, which is written by the writer of American Beauty, Alan Ball, in which the charcters have to act out and are restrained because of obligation, and they have friends that have lives they want, and there is yearning, and sadness.  This just seems like dull lives, and the people living it endlessly complaining.  The desires are talked about, but it seems so abstract, wanting to go to Paris, that the audience doesn't want to go to Paris, or want its Characters to go to Paris.  All that is really portrayed in this film is two people with nothing in common, who get married, and grow to hate each other, and the only time they seem to be happy is when they are making childish plans that cater to fantasies they had when they were younger.  There are no relatable or interesting characters, save the mental patient who defies the culture of the time, and tells the couple how horrible they are, when I don't think that either character is horrible.  I wonder what he would say about this movie?  Same Mendes, and Kate Winslet divorced after this, I would love to see Sam do something with some passion and take from this rather than do some pretentious work that he dug up.

$REVIEW.: Roman Polanski has made some stinkers in his day, but this 2010 release is not one of them

It's a good suspense film that never goes over the top, and that's a good thing
There's no gory violence to speak of, and mercifully, no car chase to attempt to liven things us


Instead, we get a sort of intellectual thriller in which a writer finds clues to lead hm to think something is rotten in Denmark with the former British prime minister whose boring memoir he has been hired to spice up
There are no real jolts in the twists, and the ending is poetic, not false, as some have charged


I also liked the spare soundtrack.

There is none.  There is no  plot, this movie consists of little creatures running around and doing  mindless slapstick moves on each other.Animation?  This is what really  stands out as being horrendous.  Dialogue consists of 2 frames of animation  (one with the mouth open, one with it closed).  Not that it matters, the  dialogue is never in sync anyway.This is just a lame movie.  It is just  low quality animation, with BAD and ANNOYING acting, and a very low  production value.

$review_text.: I've always liked The Outer Limits. The old series, despite its relatively low budget and cheesy special effects, was a gem. The new one had much better special effects, and the stories were, by and large,very good. I realize, this stage in my life, how valuable stories can be.But, first, on each DVD is an introduction. It's a noisy announcement, complete with lightning-fast graphics, that shows that's it's a criminal offense to download films, etc. from the web. If I were inclined to download the same, that announcement wouldn't discourage me from doing so. Since I consider "high speed internet" an extravagance, I'm not inclined to do so. So the "announcement" is particularly obnoxious.Next, the series, like any, had its ups and downs. But I like most of them. Among the ironies of my giving this series only two stars is that a few of my favorites are in the set. I really like "Afterlife" with Clancy Brown. "Relativity Theory" is a great political/economic commentary with which I agree. "Gettysburg" is excellent. And there are others. But they should have released the series based on the season, like they did with the old one. As it turns out, they did later. So I'm getting duplicates, of some I didn't even like that much!And that leads to one episode that I didn't like. Unfortuntely I can't recall the title now. But I dislike it because all they did is take clips from earlier episodes and try to make a new episode out of it.  That seldom works. "Star Trek: The Next Generation" tried it once or twice and it didn't work for them either.Finally--and this is as much my fault as those who're selling the series--a few of the sets were released before. So I already have "Sex and Science Fiction" (see my review here on Amazon.com) and "Time Travel and Infinity." They simply should have released the series by the year. By now, I assume I'd already have probably the first three years. And I needn't have purchased duplicates.If you get this set, anticipate the long announcement at the beginnning of each side of each DVD. No fun.If I were you, I'd get the sets based on the seasons. The first season is already available, and wait for the rest.

A full-boredigital treatment should clean these up completely: smooth outthe all important contrasts and colors, while sharpening - andsoftening, when appropriate - those lovely details even better.Quite simply, there remain far too many inconsistencies forthis wonderful movie to suffer from.Same goes for the sound.There are tracks that drop off entirely, background soundsthat are not quite clear enough, inconsistent application of stereo separation.I humbly suggest that it would not be any violation, but ratherentirely appropriate and an IMMENSE improvement, to edit the lastshot by freezing it a few beats, then fade to black for a fewmoments longer before that annoying Paramount logo pops in.Think that's over the top?  Replay the ending a few times andconsider what an impact these tiny changes would have.Betcha Hitch would agree!Finally, those "extras"


 Come on, folks!  A more detailed documentary is called for -wouldn't hurt to actually includesome discussion of the story's symbolism and meaning
 And whatabout that commentary?  Instead of much of the well intentionedbackground babblings we get, wouldn't it be swell to have someoneactually address the esthetics and technique of the images andsounds being presented?In other words, fans, it's time to take Madellyn back to the mission tower.You know it's the right thing to do.

$REVIEW.: I am a big fan Of Jane Austen. Sadly she only wrote 6 major works-which I have read and re-read those novels numerous times. I have also re-watched and re-watched the various adaptations.I needed "new" material!It was recommended to me by a Janeite that I watch this. I had missed the PBS airing, and so I rented this through Netflix. Well I enjoyed this enough that I bought this through Amazon.This is based on three novellas of Elizabeth Gaskell. Cranford, Doctor Harrison's Confession, and My Lady Ludlow. (which I read after I saw this)I felt the two "Sue's" (Conklin and Birtwistle) did a wonderful job of weaving these 3 stories together.The only thing I did not like was there were a couple of accidents in this story-and I found these were portrayed a little too graphic for my taste. Otherwise(if you are not squeamish like me)this was a "G" story all the way and suitable for the whole family to watch.
$review_summary.: I would love to live in Cranford-if such a town existed!

$review_text.: I have always wanted this film, ever since I saw it on Disney Channel a few years ago
I bought a used copy of the DVD and I am very impressed with it
It plays like a charm - no pauses or skips anywhere

Very good quality for the price!Also, this has to be one of Hilary Duff's most charming roles

Duff portrays Terri, a girl who moves to L.A

to follow her dreams of making it big
As Terri follows her heart, she discovers that if she is true to herself, she will go far in life

Very adorable film!

$review_text.: Many people that claim to be Star Wars fans are venomously against this movie.  I don't understand it - this is a very worthy addition to the Star Wars universe.  The fun is there (&quot;I have a bad feeling about this&quot;), the action is there (especially the lightsabre duels - far superior to any of the previous ones), and the movie is a fun experience.  All the SW movies are thin on plot and have hokey dialogue - why are people upset that this one should too?The main problem with this film is that we already know the end (Return of the Jedi).  SW fans will consider these films as history.  There's little suspense in Darth Maul vs. Obi-wan because we know Obi-wan lives another 30 years!  Similarly, Anakin is obviously going to survive the pod race and the space battle, because he lasts until RotJ.  By the same argument, we cannot shed tears for other characters that we know are dead in the &quot;present&quot; - Amidala, Qui-gon, Mace Windu, etc.  Thus, some dramatic tension is lost.  Having said that, though, the fun of SW is the action and immersion in the Galaxy Far, Far Away.The DVD edition is fantastic, even if you think the movie is sub-par.  There are numerous behind-the-scenes features, all of which give a nifty inside look at the making of the film.  Especially interesting is the look at the digital manipulation of people and places.  Parts are very impressive - Coruscant, the Gungan city, etc.  Others need some work - Jar Jar is the most obvious.  There's something very unnatural about the way he moves, occasionally defying the laws of physics, and he's distracting in the background because he moves too much.  The cut scenes are fun to see, the commentary is full of tidbits and features George Lucas and several others (including ILM fixture Ben Burtt), and a neat 3-way split-screen feature on how storyboards are brought to the screen.  There's also the obligatory ads (both TV and cinema), some of which I never saw before, and the video for Duel of the Fates.The combination of a pretty good movie on a great DVD full of extras makes this the jewel of my DVD collection, and highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: While the movie will entertain many with it's mecha robots/gundams to take on the alien reptilian giants(godzilla and friends) there really isn't much to make you cheer or cry for any of the characters much even when they try and bring up their tragic history and the like and that ironically is the saddest part of the movie, a lack of empathy for the characters.It's nice to see the different mechs and the intriguing though somewhat generic way on how they work and why,of course the major reason many of us wanted to see the movie was the mech/monster fights and those don't disappoint which raises the value of the movie.Also ironically of the cast the main male hero character seemed the least talented and I just didn't really care for him,out of the film cast I say the best performances came from Idris Elba,Ron Perlman(Cameo),Charlie Day and Rinko Kikuchi. The movie is an alright sci-fi summer flick if you don't put to much thinking into it but expect a strong plot or a great male lead or something and be disappointed.

$review_text.: As an earlier reviewers has pointed out, Anchor Bay has released TWO different prints of Sleuth, so you'll want to be careful which release you purchase.  The older release had an unsatisfactory transfer that looked very bad.  That version was a flipper disc and was packaged with a WHITE cover, and Anchor Bay has wisely let it go out of print.  Avoid it!  (Unless you collect OOP DVDs....)The newer release has a BLACK cover and boasts a much improved transfer.  (Just compare the vibrancy of the colors in the film to the muted colors in the unrestored trailers to see what I mean.)  In addition to putting the whole film on one side of the disc, Anchor Bay also included an extensive and fairly interesting interview with writer Anthony Shaffer.  This version is probably definitive -- and certainly the one to buy.Apparently, however, Anchor Bay is going to let this release go out of print, too.  (It has disappeared from their online catalogue.)  So buy this quickly if you have any interest in it at all.  I can't imagine any other company giving this film a better overall treatment.

$review_text.: SPOILER ALERT: If you have not seen the first two seasons of Lost you may want to wait to read this review
This will either give things away, or confuse you as you watch the first two seasons.Things start to really heat up on the island as Jack (Matthew Fox), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and Kate (Evangeline Lilly) find themselves prisoners of "The Others", who might need more from them than they're letting on


As for the other survivors of Oceanic 815, Mr


Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Locke (Terry O' Quinn) find another hatch which may prove that pushing a button every 108 minutes in the first hatch is futile
Could "The Others" be their chance to get off the island? Why hasn't anyone come to save the survivors of Oceanic 815? Where did "The Others" come from? What will happen if they don't push that button? What is the purpose of the Dharma Initiative? Some of these questions will be answered, and so many more will be asked by the end of the third season!The first two seasons of Lost don't even begin to prepare you for what comes next, which is fine by me! One of the great things about Lost is it's compelling storyline that always keeps you guessing, and as time goes by I, all at once, feel that I wish I would have seen this when it first aired on TV and that I'm glad I waited

Watching all of this at once means that I don't have to wait after an episode to see what's going to happen next, but at the same time I can't really talk to anyone who's already seen the series about what happened in the episode I watched last night because they're already way beyond that


But here I am, a little closer to getting caught up with the series.After season 2 which really felt more like a place holder between seasons 1 and 3, season 3 really gets the ball rolling on what the show's really about

Unlike the previous 2 seasons, season 3 might introduce you to new characters, but because those characters are meant to be shrouded in secrecy it doesn't do much to really introduce them
This lack of introduction allows the story to propel forward faster than the previous two seasons
Not only do you get flashbacks in season 3, but now you have flash forwards as well

The way that everything's set up is brilliant storytelling, even if it doesn't give you the satisfaction of a quick and easy payoff.More new characters are added to the roster this season, most of which aren't really explained too much as they serve the purpose of fleshing out characters in flashbacks and flash forwards, or to further the story of "The Others"
Of these new characters Elizabeth Mitchell (V, Gia) as Juliet is the most important
Of course, there's always the stand outs in the crowd, and Terry O' Quinn continues to shine as John Locke, but in his first full season Michael Emerson as the oily Benjamin Linus upstages everyone

As a master manipulator bending everyone to his needs, Michael Emerson is the true star of this season.As with season 2 there is a slight problem of some characters doing things that seem to be more about moving the story along rather than being in the best interest of what the characters would or wouldn't do

While not as bad as the second season in this aspect, it can still be distracting as you move along through the series

Of course, this isn't a major problem, as the twists and turns of the plot may leave you more distracted than the character's acting against type at times, and those twists and turns keep your further invested in the story.In my opinion, season 3 is really where Lost kicks off


The first two seasons get you into the characters, but the third season starts to answer some of the questions and pushes you into the direction of where everything is heading


Of course, by the end you'll probably be asking more questions than what you had answered, but the intrigue will leave you hungry for more.4.5/5

$REVIEW.: If you are looking for a film with characters you can empathize with, moral redemption, and a happy ending, this film will leave you unfulfilled.  I must admit that this film caused a serious argument between myself and my SO within a half hour of watching it.This film is a social commentary about relationships, how people deal with unhappiness, and the constant search for answers in situations where there are NO answers to be found.Its easy to be seduced by the beautiful scenery, wit, and gag comedy that pops up thru out.  In the midst of this I found myself becoming increasingly unhappy by the choices made by ALL of the women in this film who found convenient reasons to lie, cheat, and deceive.  First they deceive themselves and then everyone else around them....for what?  Is that the question of this film.... What are we searching for and what are we capable of during the search to find and ACHIEVE it?  Secondarily, do we even understand ourselves well enough to define our happiness when we so easily toss away the things we search for once we have them?If character development is your thing, this could be your film.  If you wish to feel good afterwards, RUN RUN RUN from this film....

I grew up watching these (so you can guess my age range) and for the last few months I've watched a few every Saturday while cooking (well, making a huge mess in the kitchen and hoping I end up with something edible). I don't know what kind of restoration was done but they are flawless - sound is good, colors in the later seasons pop out at you, and you even get the pilot with its not so great cast and some other fun extras. I'm nearly done season 3 and haven't hit any disk flaws. This is really a fantastic deal! And for the guys out there who haven't made up their minds about The Question, the image clarity of Mary Ann in her skin-tight little outfits will finally provide you with an answer.

$REVIEW.: Let's all be honest.  The main reason this film achieved so much was because of Daniel Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones.  Lewis nailed President Lincoln, from his accent to his mannerisms to his love of storytelling and witticism.  Lewis BECAME Lincoln.  Sally Field also did an excellent job portraying the mentally complex Mary Todd.However, all of this fine acting, great casting and pretty good writing is confounded by the disjointed plot.  Frankly, if I were ever to watch this again, I'll take notes so I can remember who is who and when things are occurring.  It is very difficult to remember who each character is because there are far too many of them, and then to try and remember which side they were on politically is also an arduous task.  The sheer magnitude of the number of characters in this film is overwhelming and, I believe, takes a very great deal away from the film.Another grievance is the fact that they don't lay out a little time line so viewers can know when things are occurring in relation to Lincoln's inevitable assassination.  They don't say, "February 21st, 1865".  Again, this can be confusing because a great deal of time passes between major plot points.Finally, there is far too much going on at one time.  From trying to pass the amendment to winning over lame duck democrats, to the civil war, to Lincoln's domestic trouble...  It was simply far too much for anyone to take in because the viewer was being bombarded with different story lines.In any event, I would recommend this purely for Jones and Lewis' acting performances because that is what made this film so popular.  As far as rewatch value, there really isn't any.

Hopefully (I believe this is the right number), the 11.9 million British viewers that watched the show, will spawn a further series
If you really want to learn a bit more on hard it was for Doug Naylor and associates to get this off the ground and the broken promises and small budget

Turn on the commentary with writer/director Doug Naylor, very enlightening

This style was apated during the depression era when the world Dark (alternate &amp; original name given to the Screwball Comedy) and cynical world.  Simply put, a comedy to which we have zany and dizzy story lines which for some reason strike our funny bones and cause us to laugh uncontrolablly.  Many Dark and Negative stories take on a satarical form.  We poke fun at the absurd learn to look for the &quot;sliver lining&quot; the opermistic side of the story/situation.In Summary:  We find ourselves immersed in the depression years  at the New York City dump with the rich heirs and heiresses involved in a scavenger hunt (looking for the &quot;Forgotten Man&quot;) and the poor destitute living amongst this rubble.  A zany young heiress Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard) finds a &quot;Forgotten Man&quot; Godfrey (William Powell). His attraction to this girl &amp; curiosity satisfied returns to the scavenger hunt headquarters so Irene can win the hunt.Irene admires Godfrey and hires him on the spot to be the family butler and her protege' or &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;.This is one of the all time classic Screwball comedies and Carole Lombard with William Powell give us a great performance.We need to see this movie and listen to the commentary to remember and understand the 1930's the depresssion and how the world coped and survived to give us the &quot;GREATEST GENERATION&quot;.&quot;OUR MAN GODFREY&quot; delivers.

$REVIEW.: This is it, the final season of Sailor Moon.  And I for one don't like it.  Although I feel that the anime greatly improved upon the manga for the first 3 years & some of the fourth, this is where the manga totally blows the anime away.  I know it has its fans, & if you enjoy it that's perfectly fine.  But I'm sorry, I did not.  If you haven't seen it, there are many spoilers ahead.The season begins with the 6 part story arc I like to call Nehellenia's Revenge.  A mysterious benefactor frees Nehellenia from her curse.  She shatters her Dream Mirror and the shards either morph into Nehellenia clones or get in people's eyes, causing them to want to do nothing but look at themselves in mirrors.  The victims include Mamoru.  I have to admit this is a decent arc overall, despite some big flaws.  There are some Les Yay lines between Uranus & Neptune (the worst ones come later on in this season), Mamoru gets taken out easily by a villain he should have finished off, Chibiusa's "death" is good but nowhere near as strong as it was in the manga; but the worst part is the ending.  It's revealed Nehellenia only clung to her beauty because she believed that's the only reason anyone liked her, so the Sailor Senshi & Prince Endymion combined all their powers & gave her the chance to relive her life from when she was a child.What.  The.  Heck?!I think even Doctor Who would say this made no sense.  For starters, they forgive a person who committed genocide just to stay beautiful forever?  No, it's worse than genocide because the victims become the living dead & serve her until someone kills them.  And how come they can even do it in the first place?  The Inner Senshi's powers combined can't heal a dying person (like Saphir), but with the Outer Senshi they can rewrite time and space?  And finally, this should really mess up the continuity in one of 2 ways.  What if this back fired, & she prepared herself for the Sailor Senshi & took them out when the time came?  And even if this had worked, how come nothing changed?  If the Dead Moon Circus never came into being, they never would have met Pegasus, so shouldn't-gah, my head hurts!  Suffice to say, this where Sailor Moon basically went off the deep end for me.And the sad thing is it was one of the 2 best parts of the season (we'll get to the other one at the end).  The main part of the season is where the show really went wrong.  A new boy band known as the Three Lights has come to town & with them the evil Shadow Galactica, a group consisting of Sailor Senshi gone bad, and the possibly heroic Sailor Starlights.  The evil Sailor Senshi were all well written villains (one of the very few improvements over the manga at all this season was giving Iron Mouse & Aluminum Siren actual characterizations, though Lead Crow & Tin Nyanko were 2 of the few manga villains with decent personalities that the anime expanded on, but Galaxia was MUCH better in the manga), but the Sailor Starlights are what's really wrong with this season.  First of all I have to admit that aside from what I'll say later, they were given better characterization than in the manga, but the manga versions were cooler.  Why?  In the manga, they were girls who cross dressed as boys but they were wholesome cross dressers.  Seiya only started dating Usagi because she thought she might be their princess.  In the anime, they're males who physically transform into female Sailors.  That was when Naoko Takeuchi, the creator, got really upset with the producers of the anime, & I don't blame her.  She said that only females can be Sailors, which gets no argument from me.  The anime raises way too many awkward questions, especially when Seiya really becomes romantically involved with Usagi.  The vast amount of fanfics pairing these two (often with the pairings Taiki/Ami & Yaten/Minako) just boggles the mind.  Aside from the fact that they're screwing up the timeline & giving poor, awesome Mamoru the shaft, these pairings are so messed up that I'd actually rather read stories where Mamoru marries Rei or even ones where Usagi falls in love with Prince Demando!  And that's sad, because most of the stories for these episodes were good apart from the gender bending issues & some really adult humor (like the one where they have a party at Usagi's house & everyone shows up; it's funny but some parts really made me cringe).  But one of the biggest flaws this season is the fights.  The Sailor Phages are hardly my favorite Monsters of the Week, but they were honestly fairly creative & a good way to extend the show.  But it really ticks me off just how much they downgraded Sailor Moon this season.  It shows in episode 194, during the fight with Sailor Tin Nyanko.  As one Youtube commenter noted, she had absolutely no offensive moves.  Just so you know in the manga, her attack for this season was a killing move.  Why couldn't they have made a different attack for healing people like they did in the first season?And now we come to the finale, which is both the best & worst part of the season.  On its own, it is pretty strong, though the deaths of the Sailor Senshi were not nearly as heartbreaking as their deaths in the first season.  I could have lived without Sailor Moon & Sailor Galaxia getting naked at the end, but apart from that it was quite good (I know it's supposed to show purity & they looked like Barbie dolls but still, that was worse than the transformation sequences if you ask me).  But compared to the manga, it was nothing.  The Sailors were picked off 2 at a time, which really increased the tension.  Then Sailor Moon, Sailor Chibi Chibi, the Sailor Starlights, Princess Kakyuu Sailor Chibi Moon, AND the Amazoness Quartet all go to the end of the universe to face the villains, while in the anime our heroes just go to their local TV station.  And let me just say, the bit where Galaxia reanimates the dead Sailors & Tuxedo Mask always gets me.  Shame on them for not including that scene.  And of course, Galaxia & especially Chaos were much more complex villains in the manga.I know we're supposed to judge each on its own merits, but the producers really botched it up this time.  I'm sorry to say this but the manga wins this time by a country mile.  However, I must admit that no matter what this was still very well produced technically, hence the 2 star rating.  The animation has never been better, the music was still good & the voice acting was excellent as always.  I'm really looking forward to the new Sailor Moon reboot now, especially since Naoko Takeuchi confirmed it would be closer to the manga.  While I don't think I'll enjoy the first 3 arcs as much as the original anime, I'm sure she won't let Toei make the same mistakes they did with the last 2 arcs.  I just hope they can get as many of the original actors back as possible.

$REVIEW.: It's alright. Not as good as Halloween though. After a few kids accidentally cause the death of a little girl (tease her out of a second floor window), they vow to never speak a word of what they did and pretend it never happened. Years later the kids are now teens, preparing themselves for the big night. The dead girl's sister Kim (Curtis) is dating one of her late sister's killer's Nick (Stevens) without knowing anything about his past, but someone knows, someone was there and saw the whole thing and he/she thinks it's time for justice. He/she makes obscene phone calls, sends them scary notes and on Prom Night he/she takes out the axe and decides to get some work done. Gore? Very little. The scene when the little girl falls out the window is pretty disturbing, an offscreen slit throat but the hilarious beheading scene. All in all it's pretty cheesy, but there are alot worse out there.

$review_text.: I never thought I would see the day that I would rate any product that contained the greatest film comedy team of all time,Laurel and Hardy,with just one star!!But it seems Hallmark has managed to elevate banality,mediocrity and utter codswollop to an entirely new level.And it is with no small sense of regret that I have to say this.I have seen most of these films in their European release formats and to say these Hallmark versions are far inferior to those would be an understatement.The European mindsets' credo generally seems to be when releasing anything whether it be audio or visual to obtain the best possible sources from which to work with then do the necessary work in order to release the best possible product that you can.All related North American industries should have taken a page from their book YEARS ago!Here are just a few examples of what I have noticed in this Hallmark DVD:All of these prints seem to be incomplete and the original elements used are average to worse in condition.No effort it seems was used at all to obtain the best possible negatives from which to work from.And what "work" has been done is strictly basic digital transfer with a slight alteration for contrast.In other words the films look a little better than their VHS counterparts but countless imperfections of all sorts run rampant throughout ALL of these pictures and have astoundingly not been corrected in any way.'Sons of the Desert' does not contain the original MGM opening(with lion roar and music....the same for most)and it inexplicably has fade outs for what appears to be commercial breaks!! I can only surmise that this print originated from some TV showing in days past.Now that's quality!'County Hospital' gives us a print of the "Film Classics" 50s version complete with the opening "plaque".'The Music Box' has a horizontal tape glitch line(!) running from bottom to top just as Stan opens the back of the wagon near the beginning of the film.The rest of the shorts are again totally average in their transfers and quality.Let me state clearly that ALL of Laurel and Hardy product that is extant is available in its' original theatrical format(i.e.as orginally seen) with proper opening sequences intact andaccompanying music.So there is no excuse whatsoever that Hallmark would/should release an INFERIOR product such as this.And although I sympathize with those who have longed for The Boys to be released onto DVD(I am one of those!) there is no way we should just en masse accept anything that is thrown at us.We as consumers,not to mention the men who made these wonderful films,deserve nothing short of the best,and that is FAR from what we got.In conclusion this release shows what is wrong,has been wrong,with the entire audio/video industry for much too long a period in North America.Inferior product foisted on an unsuspecting public either through faulty/inferior manufacturing or,as in this case,just plain indifference.It is about time we became more pro activeabout this multi-billion dollar a year industry who without OUR hard earned money/support would go nowhere fast.We should not accept such tripe as this Hallmark release and as such they deserve our utter contempt.Stan Laurel when alive could not stand to watch his films when run on TV because of them being cut to fit time restraints.I shudder to think what he would think of this release of his films.These men deserve so much BETTER!

$review_text.: Those who expect an insightful look at Wall Street and the recent stock market crash will be disappointed at Oliver Stone's "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps," sequel to "Wall Street" made in 1987. But I know this is not a documentary, and it doesn't have to be one. What is really disappointing to me is the film could have been a more riveting drama with one very interesting anti-hero Gordon Gekko.Shia LaBeouf is Jacob Moore, ace trader working for a major investment banks. His girlfriend Winnie (Carey Mulligan) is a daughter of Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), released from jail back in 2001. Despite the warning from Winnie, after listening to Gordon's speech at his lecture, Jacob is instantly attracted to the disgraced former Wall Street banker, who once told the world "Greed is good" (and now wrote a book "Is Greed Good?")The film's complicated story also Bretton James (Josh Brolin), a ruthless head of an investment bank, and Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), head of Keller Zabel Investments Jacob currently works for. Charlie Sheen briefly appears as Bud Fox, the main character of the original "Wall Street."As you know, Gordon Gekko is the role for which the star Michael Douglas won Oscar about 24 years ago, and in the sequel Douglas is quite good as charismatic and mysterious father/mentor-like figure to Shia LaBeouf's would-be son-in-law/prot&eacute;g&eacute;. This is the most intriguing aspect of "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps," with Shia LaBeouf's character similar to the role played by Charlie Sheen in the original, but it is eventually sidelined by the less convincing story about the romance and even less convincing plotline about the nuclear fusion project. And there is another subplot about Jacob's mother (played by Susan Sarandon), a real-estate agent who needs money badly.I know making a film about the still on-going financial crisis is too difficult a task for anyone to deal with (especially when you have to do it without losing entertainment value), but after watching the film, I still don't know what "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" really wants to say. So many things are going on, but not many of them are really interesting or immediate, and some plotlines are treated rather heavy-handedly with clich&eacute;d narrative elements. The film is a mixed bag, overall entertaining with some unexpected turns of events and ultimately predictable moments.

$review_text.: I must confess upfront that I really like Renee Zellweger
 There is something vulnerable in almost all of her performances, something sad and yet hopeful in her eyes

 Here she is a waitress with a straying, drug dealing, car salesman husband


 But no matter:  she's hopelessly in love with a doctor, rather, a character on an afternoon TV soap opera
 When her husband is killed, she sets out to Los Angeles with the delusion that she is somehow part of the doctor's/actor's life


 And she succeeds after a fashion

 She even dresses like a nurse, all white and crisp, and tries to get a job in a fictional hospital
 People think she is joking, but she is delusionally serious


 Then she saves an accident patient's life with a procedure she saw used in the soap opera....The movie is often funny, with pathos, jeopardy, and a completely satisfying outcome

 My only criticism is with Chris Rock, who plays one of the men who is chasing Nurse Betty (Zellweger)

 Chris Rock plays Chris Rock, the vulgar comedian whose only schtick is words that most people do not say in polite society


 I'm not amused by his comedy routine and I'm not entertained by his performance in this movie.

During the movie I was just wondering what the point was, but when you think about it, why do these kids do any of the things they do? That was the point.  I loved the twist at the end. Certainly wasn't expecting it at all.  Great movie.

$REVIEW.: This collection of the four Alien films plus the bonus features really puts you back into the sci-fi, thriller and horror roots that the Alien movies carry.  What was seen through the human eye inside the theater in 1979 will now be known as a sci-fi and horror film icon.  The movie that started it all with a handfull of frightened viewers made this movie what it is today.  A movie icon.  Four different directors showed their Alien visions by directing these movies.  The last three showed their Alien vision to keep the franchise going into what it is known as today.  Unfortunately after the final minutes of Aliens the franchise began to slow down.  It was still okay to watch because once you have seen the first two you would want to know what happens next.  Ridley Scott the director who started this franchise showed his vision for Alien.  Alien is a compelling jaw dropping film that showed its roots for terror.  After the start of franchises such as Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street comes the sequils.  The sequils following Alien were made continuing such success Alien has made.  Of course Alien is one of the movies that shows sci-fi's darker side.  The story of seven crew members on a space ship heading towards earth who encounter an Alien cast away opening the door to terrifying science fiction shown in four films.ALIEN-If there wasn't an Aliens this would be the best film in the franchise.  Comes extremely close to being the best one.  What started it all: The Alien, Ripley, and the suberb sci-fi terror.  If you were to see all the other ones first without seeing Alien first you would be lost until you did see this one.  Not criticizing anyone who has seen the others without seeing this one.  As said comes extremely close to being the best.  So close it gets 4.99.9 out of 5.  Just needed another.1 to go.ALIENS-The best one in the franchise.  Over five decades later Ripley awakes from her sleep since the Alien wrecked havok on the Nostromo.  There Ripley and a team of marines discover more Aliens and begin to fight to survive.  Not everyone survives of course as known throughout other movies like these.  Ripley protects a girl named Newt through this second round of Alien madness.  More action contained in this movie than Alien in my belief.  James Cameron did a very excellent job directing this and made this sequil as part of what he is known of.  Being a master action and drama director.ALIEN 3-So obviously what movie script writters, movie producers, and movie directors have on their minds when they make a third sequil in a franchise is to make it as good as the first two.  Obviously it might not be as good as the first two (which Alien 3 wasn't as good as the first two) but mainly the ones making a third sequil want it to just not suck.  Alien 3 did not suck but it was sort of close to not being good at all.  From here they should have stopped the franchise unless they could come up with something better to add onto the franchise.  What the script writter did was just make an excuse to just have Ripley be the only sole survivor of another round of Alien madness.  But there were two others.  Hicks and Newt.  But maybe they were not meant to be in the setting that Alien 3 was in.  Once I heard about this set not seeing the movies I saw the Alien 3 trailer.  Sigourtney goes bald and I was thinking did she shave just because she wanted to?  No.  She shaved because they wanted to (the people behind the story of Alien 3).  Crash an escape pod because of an Alien stowaway if you will but if Ripley survives shouldn't the others survive as well?  The least favorite in the series.ALIEN: RESSURECTION-After Alien's least successful film comes the second least favorite in the series.  The reason why this was better than Alien 3 was because of its action.  A very big dissapointment was to see Ripley become a clone.  When they should have stopped after Aliens, they continued with the two worst additions in the franchise that were still okay.  But if they were to have a third sequil then they should have stopped there.  This was still better than the third release but a cloned Ripley made me dissapointed.  The end of Alien 3 could have made a good end to the franchise in my opinion.  Here the movie makers of this film semmed like they made the others especially the first one dissapear into the would of classics.The bonus features help make this box set a must own for any Alien fans and not just the die hards.The movie ratings:ALIEN-4.99.9/5  The perfect start.  Lives in the world of classics but never dissapeared.ALIENS-5/5  The perfect sequil.ALIEN 3-2.5/5  Not completely bad.  Still okay but my least favoriteALIEN: RESSURECTION-3/5  The second worst in the series.  Still okay.Overall this is the must have set for the Alien fan.

$review_text.: When I was just a teenager, I remember watching the Super Mario Bros. Super Show back in 1989.  Every Monday through Thursday, they would air the live action segments of Mario & Luigi (plus a handful of guest celebrities -- remember Sgt. Slaughter, anyone?!), followed by the SMB cartoon episodes.  But on Fridays, it was all about The Legend Of Zelda.I love a lot of the voice acting, particularly from Paulina Gillis.  (She voices Princess Toadstool on SMB Super Show, SMB3 and Super Mario World and even guest-starred on Episode #166 of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 80's/90's cartoon franchise.)  Sadly, because the show was run in tandem with the SMB Super Show, there are only 13 episodes, yet there is still some great quality to be found here.  I especially love the soundtrack and how it was delightfully incorporated from the NES video game (most notably, when the Tektites kidnap Zelda or Ganon causes Hyrule Castle to sink).Now I am going to list each episode with a brief description, so enjoy!!  :)&#34;The Ringer&#34; -- Ganon makes his debut.  He enlists a quartet of Stalfos to bring him to Hyrule Castle, where he plans on stealing the Triforce of Wisdom.  It's up to Link and Zelda to stop him!&#34;Cold Spells&#34; -- Link pretends to be sick in order to get out of doing chores for Zelda.  Ganon casts a spell on Sprite the Fairy.  When she casts a spell on her cleaning supplies, her magic goes completely awry, causing damage to Zelda's room.  Ganon also makes another attempt to steal the Triforce.  Link and Zelda somehow wind up in Ganon's evil jar and are forced to kill his servant, Gohma the arachnid.&#34;The White Knight&#34; -- Link fails to rescue Zelda from a huge Octorok, so enter a white knight!  He not only kills the Octorok, but is invited to Hyrule Castle.  However, the darker side about the prince is soon revealed when a bevy of Tektites (spider creatures) and a Zola kidnap Zelda and bring her to a swamp.&#34;Kiss 'N' Tell&#34; -- When Link rescues a maiden from the three headed Gleeok (Dragon), she kisses Link, but it turns him into a frog!!  :(  To make matters worse, the &#34;damsel&#34; is actually a Gibdo (Mummy) in disguise!  Ganon captures Zelda, and it's up to Link to get his original bodily form back!&#34;Sing For The Unicorn&#34; -- Ganon uses a magical unicorn to kidnap Zelda's father, the King of Hyrule.  Ganon then osses the king into a pit room.  Meanwhile, Link and Zelda have to figure out why the unicorn is so significant to Ganon in the first place.  Their answer is soon revealed when they come across a female ninja.&#34;That Sinking Feeling&#34; -- This is my first of two favorite episodes.  A bunch of Tektites ruin a picnic for Link and Zelda.  After Link disposes of them, Ganon uses an underworld magnet to cause Hyrule Castle to sink -- WITH Sprite and the King of Hyrule inside of it!!  :(&#34;Doppelganger&#34; -- Ganon makes a duplicate of Zelda.  The doppelganger has the REAL Zelda kidnapped by Moblins.  When Link comes across the &#34;fake&#34; Zelda, he takes her and the Triforce of Wisdom to Ganon's Castle so that he can rescue the TRUE Zelda.&#34;Underworld Connections&#34; -- A trio of Ganon's bats go to Hyrule Castle to steal the Triforce -- by blowing it up into three large pieces.  Link and Zelda have to enter Ganon's castle to find the missing Triforce pieces.&#34;Stinging A Stinger&#34; -- A shrewd elf suckers Link into giving up his magical sword.  When a trio of Patras comes after Zelda, Link fails to stop them when his &#34;fake&#34; sword breaks!  And to add insult to injury, Ganon kidnaps both of the heroes and places them into a dungeon cell, where they are forced to tangle with a large Gohma!  :(&#34;A Hitch In The Works&#34; -- Ganon once again uses his Moblins to kidnap Zelda.  He places a jewel control device on her neck which forces her to obey him in every way -- including marrying him.  WHAT?!  :(&#34;Fairies In The Spring&#34; -- When the King of Hyrule orders his men to build an amusement water park, they come across a bunch of live water monsters and are forced to retreat.  It's up to Link and Zelda to find out whom is causing this mayhem -- and for once, it's actually NOT Ganon that's behind it!!&#34;The Missing Link&#34; -- Ganon and his minions launch an all-out assault on Hyrule Castle.  When he tries to aim a fireball at Zelda, she deflects it (by using the Triforce) and the fireball accidentally hits Link, causing him to -- gulp! -- disappear!!  :(  However, Link isn't actually killed; the fireball caused him to turn into a ghost, so he can't touch anything, including his own magical sword!&#34;The Moblins Are Revolting&#34; -- this is my second favorite episode of the entire bunch.  Tired of Ganon's berating and belittling, the Moblins and Goriyas take matters into their own hands by encasing Ganon inside of a bubble and sending him into a bottomless pit.  The minions then decide to launch a full scale assault on Hyrule Castle.  However, things don't exactly go according to the letter...Although the final episode did leave a cliffhanger much to be desired, Link and Zelda do make cameo appearances in another cartoon series -- Captain N:  The Game Master.  In fact, they are actually featured in THREE of the episodes!So before I sign off, I will now recite the following:  &#34;Well excuse ME, princess!!!&#34;  :)
$SUMMARY.: "Well, ex-cuse ME, princess!!"

$REVIEW.: I just got around to seeing it last night.  It never fails.  This is one of those films that I put on the back burner when it first came out because it just did not look right.  Everytime I do that to one of these types of films, it turns out that they were not must-see films.  This one is clearly not good.First, the "story" opens up without ANY type of set or explanation of who the cahracters are, what their feelings are, what they are are all about and you end up not having any feeling for them because you do not know them.  The director(who needs a different career!) just jumps right into the film expecting you to have feelings for the characters.  The ONLY thing that you know about these characters is that they are Queen Latifah and LL Cool J!  I guess that is all the producers were betting on to make a quick buck.QL's character was 'supposed' to be a stiff, striagh and narrow woman who is in love with LL.  However, as in all of her films, she is never in character and is still sounding ghetto even though she is supposed to be proper type woman.  You don't know that she was in love with LL (just a scrapbook which she looked more like a sick stalker than in love) and you certainly did not get the feeling that LL was in love with her, let alone even liking her like that.QL's acting sucked.  I have not seen CHicago, but I cannot understand how her acting could have been nominated for an Academy Award.  Even the horrible Will Smith's acting is better!  She continues to use her oh so cliche 'jokes' that only she seems to find funny.  A decent actress would have pulled it off better, but the directing, screenplay and editing could not save this film.  WHere the actors fail, the production fails even more.  Now I know why there are directors and then their are directors who specialze in comedey.  It clearly takes more than calling yourself a director to pull off a movie, let alone a comedy.Yes, the timing was oof for everyone.  Characters are talked about and then never seen again.  When you do see one again (mamely LL), you forgot that he was in the film also.  LL's acting was probaly one of his best as he did not seem like LL Cool J, but his poor character, script and screenplay ruined anything that could been.You know QL is going to die, but you really did not feel bad for her because th eproducers did a poor job of setting up the characters and bringing the audience into their world that when you hear the news, you really don't care if she is going to die or not.  In fact, there was not one charater who you would be concerned about, except maybe the Chef.The movie was filmed in teh Czech Republic, I assumed because of the low cost.  Like someone who is going to blow ALL of their money because they are going to die thinks "I will go to the world famous and always beautiful Czech Republic!"  Not Egypt, Rome, Paris, the Carribean, Hawaii - the usual spots.Al in all, this movie was not interesting.  It was boring because of the production.  This is why the most important part of a film is the story.  If you get that wrong, you don't have a movie.  The screenplay was horrible and this movie is not one for the collection, unless you are a female.  I never once got the feeling that they loved each other and I NEVER got the feeling that LL's character even like QL more than a co-worker.  They should have had me on teh job to clean this up.  Even some decent advisors would have worked.  I guess this was one of those "put together quick to make a buck" films.
$SUMMARY.: Poor Directing, story, screenplay and Editing!

$REVIEW.: "Perhaps it's better if I live in your heart, where the world can't see me. If I'm dead, there'll be no stain on our love." -- Marguerite to ArmandGarbo's most delicate and beautiful performance in a sound film gives viewers a glimpse of the magic so clearly evident to moviegoers in the silent era. Her ethereal vision of loveliness haunts every frame, director George Cukor enhancing the Garbo mystique with this romantic and sumptuous MGM production given the finest talent the studio could muster. Beautiful art direction from Cedric Gibbons and lush photography from William Daniels and Karl Freund place Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor in a netherworld of romance sublime, and tragedy supreme. Screenwriters Zoa Akins, Frances Marion, and James Hilton, the author responsible for Mrs. Miniver and Lost Horizon, may give Garbo the words, but it is the magnificent portrait she paints of an ill young woman living life to the fullest before it passes her by completely which is the anchor holding this ornate ship in place. Once we board this vessel, there is no turning back, Garbo entrancing the viewer as the tragic centerpiece from which we can't take our eyes for a single moment.Marguerite is the life of every party in 1847 Paris. Recovering after an illness she knows will strike her down before her time, she surrounds herself with the shallow denizens who haunt the parties of Paris. Tasting of life's pleasures with carefree abandon by any means necessary, her bills mount. Garbo is humorous and enchanting from the moment she appears, making us believe in spite of Marguerite's outward frivolity that something tragic exists beneath the facade of champagne and laughter. Jessie Ralph gives a lovely performance as her beloved Nanine, watching out for her Camille with a tender affection. When Armand catches her attention momentarily, he falls immediately in love, while she finds a rich benefactor to foot the bill for her spiraling attempt to go out in style. Taylor gives a solid performance despite critics who have written otherwise, and the greatest adversary Sherlock Holmes ever encountered onscreen, Henry Daniell, is the man keeping her moving almost quickly enough to forget.Armand may be of less privilege but has more class than those with which she has surrounded herself. He is also more sensitive and loyal, as his father (Lionel Barrymore) will point out in a pivotal moment in the tragedy. Pursuing Marguerite with an innocence only real love can give birth to, she begins to love him as well, stopping just long enough to taste true love for the first time. Being a farm girl in reality, she has little trouble adjusting to country life with Armand, finding happiness greater than her heart can bear. Selling off her jewels unbeknownst to Armand to keep up with debts, he requests his inheritance so they can extend their month of bliss to forever, even if it is not a properly ordained union. A visit from his father will bring about a change in Marguerite he cannot understand. Barrymore is excellent here, making his plea for his son's future a sympathetic one, despite the grave implications to the viewer, who has seen the real love of Marguerite and Armand. Garbo is equally marvelous, as we can almost see and hear her heart breaking when she pushes Armand away and takes a walk up the hill borne of love and sacrifice.Rex O'Malley has a few very nice moments with Garbo as the sympathetic pal of both she and Armand, Gaston. The final scene of this romantic masterpiece is wildly famous, so it is no spoiler to discuss the magical brush strokes Garbo uses to finish the portrait of a girl hanging on to happiness in its final moments. Her breathless whispers to Nanine and Gaston convey effort and pain in just speaking so realistic, one believes with their heart they are watching the final moments of a life, rather than a film. The joy on Garbo's face when she discovers Armand is outside, waiting to see her, is beautiful. And when she gathers strength so he can remember her as she was, it is heartbreaking. Tender and moving, this story of a girl living what life she has for love and pleasure, and in the process, nearly letting real love pass her by, is Garbo's finest moment on films with sound. Perhaps it is because Garbo's performance is so extraordinary, it is all one remembers, often overshadowing what a handsomely mounted film this truly is. A must see film for Garbo fans for certain, but a beautiful film classic for those with a romantic heart.

Well, I'm not going to tell you how it happened...This movie went places I never expected.  It went from a big city to a ranch in Texas to a park bench to a children's ward in a hospital to the jungles....Wow, this movie was so involved and I never knew where it was going to take me next!!!I laughed at times, I bawled at times.  This was a good, clean family movie that you can watch anywhere anytime!!!

$REVIEW.: I like Chris Pine and he is good in this movie.  I don't know how easy it is for someone to play a blind character but he did it.  This is a nice story of how someone who has to live with a severe limitations is willing to take extreme chances to make changes in his or her life.  It's a mix of comedy, romance, drama and some sexual themes but all in all...it done well and is worth watching.

$REVIEW.: This movie lingers between the lines of being the worst movie ever made, and the funniest.Don't get me wrong on this, the film is crap, no dought about it, the film is crap, but it will have you in hysterics from beginning to end. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense but you don't really care, it's full of some of the stupidest things I've ever seen (Like when the bad guy dies his hair black. Like it really makes any difference to a guy as hefty as that.He looked exactly the same.)Basically you can't go on about it for too long but it's worth renting if your looking for a comedy that will really make you laugh out loud.Saying that I would love to see the directors commentary. He might be as funny as the film itself?

$REVIEW.: This movie starts out slow and progressively gets scarier and scarier
Thats what I liked, some people may want more speed, but I find that it makes it more scary slowly building up to the ultimately freaky frightful ending


I say freaky because Kubrick makes this film weird and strange

There is one shot of two people in the hotel room, obviously ghosts, and one is dressed up like a mouse or some other strange kind of animal


It just has a strange twist to the normal scare tactics
The movie has alot of beauty to it
The blood scene coming out of the doors and flooding the room is of course horror, but it also has an artsy touch to it


I recently watched it with some kids and they were very bored at first, not enough action for them, but if I kept them focused on it, telling them things about it, kept refocusing them on it, they got really scared

They wanted me to turn it off after the old lady in the bathtub
I just love the acting


The little boys withdrawn nature and how he talked for Tony
Shelly Duvall and her naive, passive nature
Also some of the looks she gives when all the scary stuff is happening are priceless
Jack is great as head of the family turns demonic, but always with a comic edge

The movie takes that bizarre turn and mixes some real scary stuff and pairs it with strange scenes or as I said there was a sort of comedy attached to the way Jack was acting, even though it was awful, which I think made it even more the scarier

Like a man just really going through a mental breakdown

Overall, one of my favorite scary movies! A definate go see, if you don't have to be scared right away, and can allow the movie just to flow.Lisa Nary

$REVIEW.: The Exorcism of Emily Rose caught me off guard. I thought I was in for a thriller/horror movie with the same old Hollywood elements. Man, was I wrong.The Exorcism, of Emily Rose is a movie based on the real life story of Emily Rose, a young lady who headed off for college and ended up losing her mind or being possessed by Lucifer...you decide.All the elements of a great film are there: wonderful storytelling, incredible acting, good pacing, and entrancing visuals. Jennifer Carpenter (as Emily Rose) puts in one of the best acting performances I have seen in a while. I am headed to find more movies with Carpenter in them as I write. Laura Linney as Erin Bruner and Tom Wilkinson as Father Moore are strong as well.Make no mistake, the Exorcism of Emily Rose is not a horror movie, per se. But...it is very scary. I found this movie more unsettling than any horror movie I have watched this year, and I have watched many. The scene with Erin Bruner in her home was amazingly tense. Also note that there is no blood and gore in the film.This is not a film with average frights, as it may linger in the minds of even seasoned fright buffs. I went to bed after the film (I work second shift), rolled over to look at the alarm clock, and it read 2:59. It turned 3 AM as I looked. I had to get up and check all the doors in the house. I was truly creeped out.I guess the fright in the film comes from the fact that it could happen to any of us. It also comes from the unknown. Was Emily crazy?Anywho, I can't say enough good about this film. It is a court drama, a story about people you will care about, and one heck of a frightening and unsettling film that tackles huge questions about God and demons.Total Score (out of 100) = 8948 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.9 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?8 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?9 (out of 10). Intangibles.

$review_text.: I watched this as a die-hard fan of Jane Eyre who is determined to watch and own every filmed version of the book

While I think experiencing this version was a worthwhile exercise in its own right, I don't think this version offers anything that hasn't been done better since

In fact, I would say everything was improved upon only 10 years later, in the 1983 BBC version
For example, this version's faithfulness to the novel was matched, if not superceded, in the equally faithful ( and I think more dynamic) 1983 BBC version
Also, while the best thing about this version for me is Michael Jayston as Mr


Rochester - he's attractive enough to be compelling and gruff enough to be Mr

Rochester - I believe Timothy Dalton is more compelling in the 1983 version


Similarly, Sorcha Cusack, for me, suffered in comparison to Zelah Clarke's understanding and portrayal of Jane's passion

The production values in both versions seem to be about the same; they're shot much like a play

They both include outdoor scenes, but no accompanying music
If you're looking for a film version so you don't have to read the book, go with the 1983 BBC version


If you just enjoy the story, as I do, you probably won't regret the 4 hours you spend watching it yet again.

$review_text.: Glengarry Glen Ross is a brilliant examination of the American dream gone south.  This is an examination of power and desperation.Premiere Properties sell investment land.  Rio Rancho is the current project.  The sales leads for the project are pretty well worn.  The new project is Glengarry Glen Ross with brand new sales leads.Just like the leads, the sales force is either well worn or hot.  The sales force reeks with desperation.  The sales force includes Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon), Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce) all on the Rio Rancho downslide and Ricky Romano (Al Pacino), the only one on a hot streak.  Their boss is John Williamson (Kevin Spacey).  John lives and dies by his sales force.  The main office wants Rio Rancho sold out before starting on Glengarry Glen Ross.  They send division head Blake (Alec Baldwin) to incentivize the office.This only leads to more desperation in the sales staff.  Then, the office is robbed of the Glengarry Glen Ross leads.  The police are called in and all the staff is questioned.  Eventually, the thief admits to the crime.David Mamet is considered on of the great playwrights of the 80's and 90's.  What he is noted for is the exactness of his words.  This makes it very difficult for actors.  Casting is imperative.  Its not the quality of actors, its just their type.  In this case every actor is perfection.This was one of Jack Lemmon's last films and was his one of his best performances.DVD EXTRAS:Disc 1:Magic Time: A Tribute to Jack Lemmon - A wonderful 30 minute tribute to Jack Lemmon from his son Chris Lemmon, actor Peter Gallagher (Long Day's Journey Into Night), and directors Jon Avildsen (Save the Tiger) and James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross).

$review_text.: Catch That Kid is one of Kristen Stewart's (Twilight series) first films. As an action film for younger viewers, this is not a bad movie. It has a little Spy Kids and Agent Cody Banks feel to it, but is nowhere near that good.This is the classic kids will save the day. Maddy (Kristen Stewart) assembles a gang to rob a bank so she can pay for her father's experimental operation not covered by insurance.The biggest problem with the film is almost all the adult actors, have terrible make up and over act. Everybody over 20 years old is dumb (except Maddy's parents of course). The heist is pretty cool, it works reasonably well. Younger kids will enjoy this part of the film.Kristen Stewart is pretty good, she actually shows some emotion. Jennifer Beals (Flash dance) is Maddy's mother. These two actresses carry the film.As a silly bit of entertainment, this is a decent film. This was a low budget film. In the car chases they only manage to wreck a few cars. The getaway cars are go karts, really cheap to run and modify. The bank vault set is all about close ups and standard rock stage lighting supports.For the Kristen Stewart collector, this is a must have. As entertainment for younger viewers, it is a passable film.

$review_text.: If you don't buy this video tape today, don't call yourself a fan of Scooby Doo. This contains 4 of Scooby's best episodes! The FIRST episode contains creepy story of a ghost ship. The story starts normal, and gradually lets us into the tale of terror. The scenery is spooky and well done. The seperation of the gang on the ghost ship builds suspense. Daphne and Velmah take a crack at some comical one liners. (Kind of intrude on Shaggy's territory!) Well, moving on, there is a hilarious moment when Scooby and Shaggy have to buy time by cooking an unusual pirate stew! Later, clues start appearing, and we discover that this so called ghost ship may actually be linked to some human criminal activity. Shaggy's guess at the password is well done. 'Yum, yum, yum, and a liverwurst alamode. Wow! What a password!' We also get to see how brave Scooby and Shaggy can be with a few Scooby snacks! The SECOND episode is also really good. It's the old inheritance story, but with a Scooby twist. Scooby may inherit a fortune, but will he survive through the night? It has a nice creepy beginning, but they don't forget to put the laughs in. The gradual transition from normal to creepy is also well done. There is also the interesting guest star. (Cousin Slicker) Shaggy's one liners are ofcourse there: 'I gotta be brave. I gotta be brave. I gotta be brave. I gotta...I gotta be some kind of nut!' The THIRD episode is flat out hilarious. The gang lands on an island, and soon find themselves in a spooky castle. There is a hilarious scene where Velmah must carry Shaggy, Fred, and Scooby in a panic. The disappearance of Daphne creates suspense. Good! Shaggy's great one liners are ofcourse there. GHOST: "I warned you to leave. Now you must all pay." SHAGGY: "I'll pay! I'll pay! How about 4 bits?" The villain is an unusually good loser in this episode, and he even offers a bit of charm. The FINAL episode keeps with the strength of this tape. The gang gets lost and finds themselves by a haunted mansion with ghosts. There is a great deal of suspense as they face the possible danger of a headless ghost. Shaggy's one liners are ofcourse there. When asked if he and Scooby are curious as to what is going on he boldly says: "NOT IN THE LEAST!" The scenery is plausible, but yet carries a spooky charm. I don't want to ruin the ending, but there is a charming deviation from the normal routine as far as the typical unmasking ceremony goes. These are 4 of Scooby's best episodes. Don't miss them! SIDE NOTE: If you buy this Scooby tape, you don't need: "The Haunted House Hangup." Because both episodes on this tape are present on "Scooby's Creepiest Capers."

$REVIEW.: I don't know what possessed me to see this film.  Maybe after seeing Scary Movie, I was in hopes to find meaning and cheez back in teenager flicks.  I  was wrong. Amazon was right, Jason Biggs was great, Mena Suvari was  charming, and Greg Kinnear was smug.  They just didn't have much to work  with.  I didn't think Jason Biggs character was that much of a loser, he  was more of an innocent, naive, too-trusting Mid Western boy, who had  possibly the worse luck with freshman roommate placement.  The three guys  that he had to spend his college orientation days were such (as they would  say) faux-pas in their boas, flashy clothing, rayban sun glasses, and their  schemes to getting girls. The love story was cute.  Mena's character  impressed me.  She was a cool cat, that had to deal with a lot prematurely  but she seemed to get through it all right.The story is simple but it  definitely didn't WOW me.  Of course, what should I expect from a teenager  flick.

This film appeals to people of all ages as, it has the cute characters ans colour fot the youngsters and the hidden meanings for the adults.  Mike Myers is fantastic as Shrek who is a green troll who everyone thinks is a savage beast, when in fact he is just a lonely guy who longs for someone to love himm, for who he is and not what he is.  (this is where Cameron Diaz's character comes in)  I could go on forever telling you the story of this film, but i recommend that just go out and buy it as you have probably heard of it.

$REVIEW.: This is a beautiful movie to look at on the screen. All the creatures, the setting, the colors, the makeup, the special effects.  This was all absolutely splendid.  However, the story was another comic book come to the screen of good vs. evil with earth's military being the evil.  The commander for the military is every bad cliche about a military man you've ever seen.  At two hours in, I gave up.  The over the top military aspect took over the story and I had had enough. Cameron has always made visually arresting movies.  He is a master at handling extravaganzas.  However, I am really tired of his simplistic good vs. evil story lines and the ensuing battles between the two.  Oddly enough, this reminded me of DANCES WITH WOLVES but without Kevin Costner's light handed humor added into it, which was a great leavening factor.  If you love art, you will love looking at this but two hours of looking at it is more than enough. Three is really pushing it.  I, for one, am not at all surprised this did not win the Oscar.

$review_text.: The Adventures of Tintin was a film I wasn't sure what to think of. Another motion capture CG animated film? Haven't we gotten enough of those from Robert Zemeckis? Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull really soured my opinion of an already faulty foundation known as Steven Spielberg's more recently directed films. However there was an upside: both the outstanding Edgar Wright and writer/director of Attack the Block Joe Cornish contributed to the writing of the film. The cast was also incredible and the film had a reputation amongst critics who had already seen it as being this nonstop action adventure. Tintin sounded like money going into it; BIG money. The final product turns out to be rather good, but isn't quite as spectacular as the hype lets on.You're pretty much thrown into this mystery right from the start. This isn't an origin story. It's a continuation of a character most people either are already familiar with and/or immensely love. Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) buys a model ship at an outdoor market known as The Unicorn, but things become strange very quickly. Two men try to obtain the ship from him right after he purchases it: the first one warning him to get rid of it as soon as he can and the other, a man named Ivanovich Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig) offering him any price he'd like. Politely declining, Tintin takes the ship home and eventually discovers that something is hidden inside the ship. As a journalist always hungry for a story, Tintin embarks on an incredible adventure accompanied by his dog Snowy and a sea captain named Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis).The opening credits are amazing. It's traditional 2D animation, so it stands out from the rest of the film. There's this mini mystery solved during the duration of the opening credits. The pace is perfect and it's easily one of the best film openings of the year. You'll probably also notice the incredible score by John Williams right out the gate. It captures the atmosphere of crime and noir films perfectly and makes full use of a wide range of orchestral instruments. It's just an extraordinary score all around.Peter Jackson once described the film's look as "photorealistic; the fibers of their clothing, the pores of their skin and each individual hair. They look exactly like real people - but real Herge people!" This is a really exceptional quote to fall back on when trying to describe how the film looks. Textures, hair, and the way character's mouths move are all very realistic. Despite sharing motion capture qualities with recent Robert Zemeckis films such as A Christmas Carol, Beowulf, and The Polar Express, Tintin looks better. It could be due to the characters looking more like the actual characters and not the actors who portray them, but Tintin pays ridiculous attention to detail which is probably just as much a blessing as it is a curse.There are two action scenes in the film that are worth the price of admission alone; Captain Haddock's pirate flashback and the motorcycle chase scene. The pirate ship battle makes it seem like the Pirates of the Caribbean films failed miserably at anything remotely resembling action. Tintin has this fantastic use of perspective in that it's dynamic, but it doesn't get too experimental or crazy. It's like you're always in the right place at the right time. You can clearly make out what's going on at all times, which is something Michael Bay isn't able to claim the majority of the time. The motorcycle chase is my favorite of the two since it's nonstop. The pirate scene cuts back and forth between what Haddock is remembering and what's transpiring in the real world. The motorcycle chase is just in your face the entire time, lasts around six minutes, and puts you on the edge of your seat.Tintin does have its shortcomings though. It does feature two of the year's best action scenes, but it also drags quite a bit in the middle. You get a little bored at times watching Tintin and Haddock be stranded out at sea, stumble through the desert, and Haddock's incessant rambling of never having enough booze. It results in the film feeling longer than it is. There was also a big deal about seeing this on screen. "It MUST be seen in 3D," is what we were told. As you can imagine, the 3D isn't really mandatory for enjoying the film. Aside from one scene, I don't recall a huge use of it anyway. A lot of the action was also extremely unrealistic, as well. I know, it's Hollywood, it's Steven Spielberg, you're supposed to already have this suspension of disbelief anyway. If I get to the point where I notice that this couldn't happen in reality though, then I feel like the movie hasn't effectively done its job; not completely anyway. That feeling was almost overbearing at times with Tintin.The Adventures of Tintin does seem to fall a bit short of the painting critics have painted for it, but is still well worth the price of admission. This year has also been an amazing year for movies featuring dogs: The Artist had Jack, Beginners had Arthur, and Tintin has Snowy. Snowy is easily the most entertaining of the three, but he's also the most animated and the most fictional. Tintin may be a bit slow at times, but visually it's freaking spectacular and the score is an easy contender for one of the best of the year. As far as animated films go, it's films like The Adventures of Tintin that movie lovers live for.

$REVIEW.: This film would have been simply superb if it had more of an oriental feel to it


 If you read through the list of the crew, I don't think I saw a single oriental man woman or child except for the actors

 I am sure the film makers did their research, however, this movie would have better been served with a solid Asian director and as a foreign language film with more of an Asian crew as well

 However, as a guy, I really did not want to see the film in the first place-But forced to by my wife
 However, I was pleasantly surprised


 Despite the criticism above, the actors were very good, the art direction, cinematography and costumes were brilliant as well as the Oscars gave them all their seal of approval with wins in these three categories

 The director did a fine job (previous job, musical "Chicago")

 The movie was based on a book, therefore, the research done was probably pretty limited to the book I suspect and there was some controversy with the Chinese as they did not like that their actors playing Japanese Geishas
 The move started with the sale of two children to Geisha houses, then takes a spin towards a Cinderella type story as the main character becomes a slave instead of a prepping to be a Geisha, then she gets her break and the rest is in the movie
 The movie is 145 minutes long and I love action, horror, drama flicks, but I really didn't think I would like this, but I truly did


 Guys, if you want to trick your girl into watching a girl flick, rent this, it was entertaining

 It had a lot of drama, a lot of culture, how true it was, not sure, however, the transition from the Geisha to the Americans invasion was a bit awkward and felt out of place


 I would have just left it at the trials of a Geisha and the rivalry between them and left the American invasion out completely

 It is a two disk set, but I did not watch the extra features, therefore can not comment on them, but the movie was one of the better films of 05


 However, next time, more authenticity with it being made a foreign language film and an Asian director who better understands the culture
 With what they did have, very watchable and I am buying it for my collection.



$SUMMARY.: Straight from the book...

$REVIEW.: this dvd is amazing on dvd. Make sure you have surround sound. The first 2 minutes of the mive will proove to you it was worth gettting extras speakers. Not to gove away the scene but the story begins through the eyes of a robber and you can hear him breathing heavy in the back speakers. Really cool. This movie was a big hit in the theaters, and kind of dissapeared afterwards. It's got a great story which takes place in a span of two days including the turn of the century. This movie was prior to the turn of the century, so it's cool from that standpoint. The dvd extras are worth it though. There are a few deleted scenes that was cool sthey showed but you understand why they got cut. Also it has 2 trailers. This one is worth your money and sound system.

$REVIEW.: This is a movie filled with unnecessary violent rape, animal cruelty, and disgusting gore. Now the gore, for myself, did not bother me, it was the killing of real animals and the scenes of rape. The acting is horrible, and the storyline would have been descent, but because of the graphic nature of this film, it steered away from the story. This was made to be a shock film, nothing more. I was told all horror fans must see this movie, and I really do not know why. It's pure grindhouse trash.If you are into violent rape, the killing of animals for entertainment, and people being eaten, then you would love this movie. If you love horror movies, that doesn't mean you should watch this garbage. I wish I could give it a half a star.

$REVIEW.: Brutal, but with a keen sense of irony, Nicolas Winding Refn's "Pusher Trilogy" is a wildly entertaining ride that's far more sophisticated than might appear at first glance. Three films that share certain overlapping characters, the "Pusher Trilogy" also links the stories with thematic similarities--but any of these movies also stand up to independent viewing. Individually, they are gritty and effective looks at the criminal underbelly--but together, they are an undeniable masterwork! Uproariously hilarious, wickedly bloody, and even surprisingly moving at times, I wholeheartedly recommend these to lovers of international film (they are set in Copenhagen) or the action genre."Pusher" tells the story of a low-life hood, Frank. As Frank hustles up a drug deal that turns south, he suddenly finds himself in a week long scramble to get on top of a bad situation. When bad goes to worse, he turns on his closest allies and faces the final reckoning alone. But he may just be in too deep! "Pusher" is a solid action picture. Frank's relationship with his cohort Tonny is played extremely well. His desperate machinations are a doomed excursion to the darkside and have a black humor that's uncomfortably appealing. Not the most original story in the "Pusher" arsenal, but it works really well regardless. 4 stars."Pusher II: With Blood On My Hands" is easily my favorite film of the trio. Why? It is understated and surprising and, of all the films, the most unique. Tonny (the terrific Mads Mikkelsen) returns from "Pusher." Some time in the future, Tonny is being released from prison and Tonny must reestablish his place in the outside world. A disapproving father, who just happens to be a crime boss, doesn't help matters. Tonny finds it difficult to be taken as a real player and is a doormat for those that surround him, both professionally and personally. Tonny actually starts to prove that perhaps he is the most worthy character amidst a barrel of bad apples and a final act of redemption is oddly heartfelt. 5 stars."Pusher III: I'm The Angel of Death" reintroduces Milo--a boss who has played a supporting role until now. Like a mad comic opera, "Pusher III" has Milo making dinner for his daughter's birthday party, juggling rehab meetings (he's 5 days clean), and trying to maintain business as usual with his crew. When a drug deal sours (that happens way too much!), Milo's perfect day loses all sense of balance and Milo is drawn into an unpleasant series of events leading to human trafficking. Milo's bratty daughter is a hoot as are his attempts to shanghai the addict's meetings. But ultimately, it's Milo's drug fueled descent (based on both morality and pride) that is nightmarish and unforgettable. 4 1/2 stars.Each film works and succeeds on its own merits! But if you get the "Pusher Trilogy" and watch them in conjunction, it is a movie making magic. Together, I easily rate the product at 5 stars as the three different films enhance the others. Perfection. KGHarris, 1/11.

$REVIEW.: In Stanley Donen's 1967 film Two for the Road, the audience will learn about the difficult journey of a marriage.  To capture a decade, or more, of a legally tied relationship in two hours might be exceptionally difficult, as there might be several different moments that deserve the attention.  However, Donen cleverly approaches the conceptual idea of marriage problems through the Oscar nominated script by Frederic Raphael, as the married couple portrayed by Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney sets off on vacation to the French Riviera.The film opens with Joanna (Audrey Hepburn) and Marc (Albert Finney) getting stuck in a wedding ceremony, as a couple of newlyweds enter a car.  In this scene, Joanna points out the negative aspect of the newlyweds by stating, "They don't look very happy." To which Marc dryly responds, "Why should they? They just got married.", as he suggestively points out the problems of his own marriage with Joanna.  Yet, they seem to have it all; an expensive Mercedes that they can afford to bring on their flights while enjoying all the luxuries of life.  Nonetheless, these two cannot seem to find a way to concoct happiness within their marriage, as they continue their preoccupation with their unhappiness.Spiteful words and comments lash out from both Joanna and Marc, as the acts and expressions of love are far and distant apart.  They are flying to southern France where they have gone on vacation numerous times before while they both know everything there is about one another. They have acquired knowledge about each other over time and during their many trips together.  This time they have a seat open in-between suggesting the significant rift between them.  However, it was not always so, they once were darlings that struggled keeping their hands of one another.Through the inspirational storytelling technique that Raphael illustrates in his script, he brings a juxtaposition of several vacations from stretching from their first encounter, their second camping road trip, and the third vacation with friends.  There is also a vacation where they bring their daughter and the current vacation where they are flying and driving with their white Mercedes.  Each trip to the south brings a different vehicle, maybe representing some symbolical notion, but further discussion of the matter will not take place here.  However, the many vacations bring the audience on an affectionate journey to what created the icy and aloof atmosphere that lingers around Joanna and Marc.Two for the Road is presents an emotional drama with moments of terrific humor that fits the character of the film.  Occasionally the humor seems a little repetitive, but it is also quick and witty with much sarcasm.  Some of the recurring jokes might suggest a little why they are unhappy, as they both seem bored with each other.  Nonetheless, the film displays touching affection and sharp bitterness through the main characters' relationship.  Compatibility issues surface, as Joanna and Marc constantly seems to be at each other's throats.  Then there are the endearing moments that unite them, which brings out the human ambiguity in the story through the emotional rollercoaster of insecurities, trust issues, and passionate love.  It is an ingenious bobbing and weaving of emotions, as they ferociously throw vicious words at one another that ends up in passionate make up sessions where they tenderly express their zealousness.  Yet, it also offers the audience an opportunity to ponder the reasons why married people stay married, and why they can sit in each other's company without uttering a word.Two for the Road is an interesting film, as it provides dual feelings.  Occasionally, it brings the strong motions of tender feelings, yet then there are the moments when the film feels emotionally painful, as it might be close to heart for many married couples; including me.  It is within this emotional turmoil where the film finds its strength and cinematic value, as it will have the audience feel, think, and feel some more.

$review_text.: An interesting story of obsession and being alone. Although oddly paced and somewhat dull at times, &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; keeps you watching till the shocking conclusion. Williams plays Sy &quot;the photo guy&quot; who becomes obsessed with a family who brings their film to the photo center he works at. He's so into them, because it's like the family he never had. Williams' character turns out to be quite the sick individual, due to a bad childhood that the screenplay briefly touches on. I didn't know what I was in for when I sat down and hit play on my DVD player. I'm sure this isn't what I expected though. I don't recommend this to those that can't step outside of the Robin William's comedy box. On the other hand it's a pretty good movie for most adults. And Williams is 100% watchable in an unlikely role for him.

$review_text.: What can be said here that hasn't been said already?  My family, in anticipation of Pirates 3, decided to sit through a night of Pirates 1 and 2.  I had never sat down to write a review for either film as I only started writing these reviews since October 2006.  So here goes . . .I wish I can explain how much I enjoyed this film as adequate words escape me, but I have to try.  This film is great in that the performances were all top-notch.  Depp has a way about his style wherein you accept whatever he's doing even when you know he's giving you a playful wink, and I have to mention that he probably has the best entrance in a film that any leading actor could ask for from the writers.  All the other actors carry their roles with equal skill, charm, and charisma.  Well, maybe not exactly equal to Depp, but gosh darn close.In addition to the wonderful acting job the music supervised by Hans Zimmer is one of the best I have ever heard and captures the spirit of this film and genre wonderfully.  The script is well-written without any over-the-top slapstick elements that could have easily been injected into this film and would have sank the whole thing.  In addition, the special effects are mind-boggling and only enhance a great script, not attempt to replace it.  Again, that would have weighed this film down unnecessarily.With all that could have gone wrong with Pirates, it instead soars with brisk confidence which never loses direction and sails into first place for me as far as the enjoyment factor goes.  The director, Gore Verbinski, deserves much credit for steering this film into celluloid history.  A truly outstanding piece of entertainment for the whole family.  Well, almost "all", real little ones could be very frightened by the dead pirates.  In any event, this film is a true masterpiece and I'm still fuming over Depp not winning Best Actor at the Academy Awards that year as this was one difficult role to get right and he was simply perfect!

$REVIEW.: The pretty cover is a total dupe! Inside the video is the EXACT opposite. Lord almighty, this is the ugliest bellydance video I've seen in 15 years.Looks like it was shot in a 1930's catholic school gym with a dirty, old and stained, hardwood floor. Behind Farhara dressed in basic black (no princess accroutments evident...she looks less glamourous than a soccer mom) hang dragging-floor-to-ceiling tattered blue satin curtains of the gaudiest color, making your eyes beg for relief. I don`t know what those curtains are hiding but I kept expecting basketballs from the junior high team no doubt playing behind her, to come flying in.Farhana herself is not a terrible dancer persay - but lets face it, bellydance for all it's technique and work is not rocket science, but a dance whose technique is constantly under interpretion, unlike, say ballet, so tho I would not classify her as `bad`, she`s no inspiring swan song either. Her technique is sloppy and ungainly as far as a teacher goes. She's good-natured enough but does not have the polish of a professional educator and I felt ripped off by this two-bit, pathetic production and frankly was flat out angry I`d wasted my money.The audio is terrible! The echo of her voice in the empty room is unforgivable. The cover leads one to believe a romanitic almost princess-like class awaits - or at the very least, a dvd with some composure and class, but alas it is not so. Save your cash and buy almost any other bellydance video. Best of luck in the future, Farhara, and blessings to you, but this video is just not worth the purchase.If you want to see the total opposite in style, panache, and sophistication, purchase `Luscious - The Bellydance Workout for Beginners (2008)` - it is gorgeous and smart and gives you the experience you were probably looking for in Princess Farhara`s instruction and production distaster of a dvd. There`s just far too many excellent bellydance dvds out on the market to settle for the likes of this very unroyal wasteland.

$REVIEW.: This movie is very prophetic, showing a 70's family that discovers Gen X's changing view of suburbia. It exhibits an &quot;American Beauty&quot; style of showing that suburbia is not all it used to be, and that some are beginning to loose faith in it. Beautifully directed by Sophia Copalla (remember, that awful actress from &quot;Godfather III&quot;?), the mystery and depths of these over-protected girls is strikingly well captured, leading up to a not surprising (re: the title of the movie), but extremely well depicted ending. The performances are great, especially that by Kirsten Dunst, and a young Josh Hartnett. As the title says, this is a must see for generation X.

$REVIEW.: The rain beats down on a dark, dreary Greek harbor town as a young, well educated English writer (Alan Bates) climbs about a weathered freighter sailing for Crete. Basil (Bates) is making his first voyage to his ancestoral home, he has inherited some property and a mine that he hopes to re-open.Shortly after boarding Basil is approached by an enigmatic, grizzled looking Greek named Zorba (Anthony Quinn). With intense, flashing eyes and the intimidating smile of a madman Zorba looks into the face of the bewildered Englishman and boldly states, "I like you, take me with you." Surprisingly Basil agrees, thus beginning a most unconventional friendship and a journey of self-discovery the likes of which has seldom be captured on film.From the first sighting of Zorba peeking through the rain drenched window on the ship you become distinctly aware of the presence of a unique and magical personality.  A personality embodying the soul and wisdom of the ages. Priest, confessor, shaman, guru, enlightened master, friend and follow traveller. Reminiscent of the Greek God Pan, Zorba laughs, sings and dances through all the joys and tragedies of life viewing everything as a necessary part of the process of living. As Zorba tells his young friend and pupil, "Life is trouble, only death is not."Zorba works his magic from beginning to end and will enchant the viewer long after he leaves us dancing with Basil on the barren sandy beaches of Crete against the backdrop of the beautiful Mediterranean.Adapted from the novel of the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis and released in '64 'Zorba the Greek' truly captures the existential landscape of the 20th century and Anthony Quinn and Alan Bates deliver the performances of a lifetime. Add to the mixture the stark but inviting scenery of the island of Crete and an intoxicating soundtrack of traditional Greek music and you have one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time. Truly a masterpiece! OPA!!

$REVIEW.: I picked this movie up on a whim at the video store and I was very pleasantly suprised. I had seen Posey in &quot;The House of Yes&quot; and didn't like the film, but liked her. The film has great music and a good back drop of the club scene between drugs, fashion-tinged clothing, and club kids. I was not familiar with Omar Townshend, but he is believable as the Lebanese falafel vendor that Posey gets involved with. This is a light, enjoyable flick and of the variety that romantic comedies should be: sweet, intelligent, and with a happy ending. Definitely worth watching!

$REVIEW.: It's a beautiful, timeless love story that is so well-written that it's breath-taking when the plot twists.  It's very difficult to NOT giveaway the twists in a story to a writer watching a film.  I was distracted enough by other details that the two big plot twists packed a major wallop.  It's theme of love, acceptance, personal growth, and all the things that are really important along with its wonderful, wonderful characters will stay with you forever.  I know nothing about animation.  Visually, it seemed stunning.  But while so many animated films rely on the visual alone, this is as complex and vibrant a story I've seen in a film in quite some time.  Oh, and it's hilarious.

$REVIEW.: Having just seen a great stage production of "Guys and Dolls" a few days before we watched the movie version, my wife was against watching the movie, even though the movie featured both Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra.  We started the movie and she was "hooked" in a couple of minutes!  The foreknowledge of the plot only served to enhance our pleasure.  Upon reflection, we had stumbled on the best sequence!  We knew all of the songs in both, and appreciated the acting by each performer.  It was just great!It was rather like watching the performance of a play that was faithful to a favorite book.

$review_text.: Spider-Man 2 is one of the best comic book films ever made.  The story is well crafted and executed with great force by the director, visual effects advisors, and the strong cast.  Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are given more material to work with and give superior performances than in the first film.  And Alfred Molina gives a great supporting performance as Doc Oc.This is definitely a film that should be looked at as more than comic book adventure and more of a well written and well made film.
$SUMMARY.: Great Comic Book Flick

$review_text.: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind DVD Review2 Disc Collector's Edition (2004)This is an almost a perfect movie for me.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was directed by Michel Gondry who also wrote it along with Charlie Kaufman and Pierre Bismuth

I want to live in this man's head for a day, his brilliance and creativity and ingenuity with limited resources was inspiring and gripping to say the least


This is a different kind of love story, beginning at the end and ending at the beginning

Joel played by Jim Carrey and Clementine played by Kate Winslet are a couple who have had their ups and downs like anyone else


During this latest down, Joel goes to a specialist to have his memories of Clementine erased after he finds out she did the same for him

As he drifts though the memories, he finds he doesn't want to forget because he still loves her.Jim Carrey took a turn for the dramatic here


One of his first scenes is really balling his eyes out in the car in utter anguish


It hits you right in the gut when you realize you can empathize with that emotion of being at bottom and that this normally comedic actor strikes right to your core

This character is so different from his other roles


He's shy, awkward, inhibited for once, angry, and heart-broken.Kate Winslet is one of my favorite actresses
Her Clementine is real, quirky, charismatic, impulsive, and moody


She is the outgoing one instead of Jim Carrey and carries many of the comedic moments
Her unique rainbow of hair colors really displays her personality to the world.Meanwhile, Tom Wilkinson plays Dr


Howard Mierzwiak, inventor of the process of erasing memories

His employees include his receptionist, Mary played by Kirsten Dunst who admires him and secretly loves him, field worker Stan played by Mark Ruffalo who is in love with Mary and has a relationship with her, and another field worker, Patrick played by Elijiah Wood

Elijiah Wood plays an uncharacteristically creepy role here (this was before Sin City, mind you) who falls in love with Clementine during the memory erasure and uses Joel's memories to woe her


It's a very complicated layering of love triangles and while the storyline of the memory clinic workers is linear, the story of Joel and Clementine is backward through Joel's eyes.It's amazing how memories of a person are just moments in time that you experience with them, good or bad and they can be very random or very special

Since it's all within the mind, there's a lot of jumping around and fuzziness, especially as Joel tries to find ways to outwit the process
It's also one of those movies where you actually notice how good the music is, I got the soundtrack afterward
The love themes and the "Elephant Parade" track are especially moving

This movie will stick with you emotionally, the last scenes always bring tears to my eyes


It also takes you on a thrill ride that will open up your mind and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering if he will succeed.DVD Extras:There is director & writer commentary and there are conversations with the director alone, with Jim Carrey, and with Kate Winslet as they dissect characters and talk about how certain effects were done


It's amazing how simple some things were and how many ideas the director had, many that never even were used! One example is during one memory of an argument with Clementine, Joel is walking away and she becomes blurry while he does not


There were a pair of grips walking behind with a frosted glass pane to achieve the effect
In another scene, Clementine is leaving the apartment and she goes into one room and then appears in another and then appears by the front door
This was achieved with trapdoors and at the last second, a body double! Very smart, very simple
In one scene taken in one shot, Jim Carrey had to play Joel in the doorway and then Joel sitting in a chair in the room so he kept running behind the camera and putting his hat on and off till they got it


Some deleted scenes show more dreamy out-of-sequence events and odd situations with Clementine and Joel trying to evade the memory erasers
They give just a little more activity for the characters and illustrate the genius of the director


A Polyphonic Spree Music video is on Disc 1 and you'll either love it or hate it
It's a very sunny song that will make you jump around the room or groan in disgust depending on your frame of mind


I really enjoyed the Lacuna Commercial also on Disc 1 showing how the memory erasing could be advertised by the company, it's pretty amusing and disturbing at the same time


One of my favorite bits would be the Anatomy of a Scene bonus feature on Disc 2 where they take the major fight scene where cars and things are falling from the sky in the memory and breakdown how it was done in layers, how things were added, until the final product developed

One last thing, this DVD comes with a Souvenir booklet that mainly has quotes from critics about how special and unique they felt the movie was along with many production still photos.

I didn't watch it when it was first released (remember - I don't like action movies).

Great action, great (but sometimes over the top) effects, great drama, and lots of thrills.

$REVIEW.: Whatever deficiencies Burton's biopic may have as a film are readily compensated for by a subject matter, script, and style so cinematically evocative that the viewer is apt to sense he's seeing many other films at the same time.  Burton captures the fanaticism in every true movie fan, the sheer exhilaration experienced by the lover of movies of every artistic level, the driven exhuberance and enthusiasm that unite the best directors and their audiences.The posters in Woods' office--of &quot;Kane,&quot; &quot;Dracula,&quot; and numerous grade B movies--range from the sublime to the ridiculous, each betraying their owner's undiscriminating passion for films and his compulsive need to complete his projects.  At one point he meets the great Orson Welles (an uncanny impersonation by Vincent D'Onofrio) who, like Wood, is struggling to finance his latest project--&quot;Don Quixote,&quot; of all things!&quot;All visions are worth fighting for,&quot; Welles counsels Wood, who takes the advice to heart.  Sharp enough to know the greatness of &quot;Kane&quot; even in the fifties and smart enough to quote Coleridge's definition of imaginative art as &quot;the willing suspension of disbelief,&quot; Wood remains oblivious to the fact that his movies are fooling no one--except himself.  He watches them repeatedly and uncritically, mouthing each word of atrocious dialogue, shedding tears of pathos and joy, and always shaking his head in disbelief at the wonder of his own illusions.It's easy to see why Tim Burton would be drawn to a project such as this, and Burton's own attraction to the surfaces of the medium, to the light and shadow of the projected image, and his eye for the off-beat make him a creative and spiritual descendant of Ed Wood.  And Ed, like every great director from Eisenstein to Burton himself, understands the very essence of cinema.  It's not about the &quot;reality&quot; documented by the camera: it's about the creative, imaginative, inventive mixing and matching of strips of celluloid.  Early in the film he makes the claim, &quot;I could make an entire movie of stock footage.&quot;Many directors could, and have.  But Ed is represented by Burton as being uncritical and fanatical about his projects to the point of being utterly and fatally careless as well.  He's energetic, relentless, generous, but never exacting.  The &quot;details&quot; don't matter, he tells his crew and producers on &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space.&quot;  And so his failures, though no less resounding, are at least free of cynicism and are fueled by a vision of cinema in which the viewer's imagination can be counted on to replace verisimilitude.  Wood brings to film-making a kind of free-spirited, carefree vision that disciplined film-makers like Burton know can never succeed with a public insisting that film simulate, and not merely symbolize, reality.My only reservation about Burton's impressive tribute is the casting of Johnny Depp as Ed Wood.  Depp is a skilled, off-center actor and somewhat of a cult Hollywood figure himself.  But Depp's adolescent voice and youthful appearance almost suggest a star-struck, recent teenager going for broke against all odds--a common, familiar theme throughout our culture.  Wood, on the other hand, was an innocent, enchanted child-creature in a grown man's body.  He's the amateur in us all, including those of us who might fit the description of a middle-aged yuppie in possession of nothing more than a camcorder, an iMac movie editing program, and a dream.

Performances are uneven and there are holes in the story that beg to be filled
 Nevertheless, the Greenlandic landscapes of the second half are breathtaking, and it's interesting to see a story about a different culture told by someone OF that culture
 It's certainly worth a watch.

$REVIEW.: I don't share the conventional wisdom that this is some kind of masterpiece, but it's a good film.  It's slow in spots but Bill Murray is inspired and Scarlett Johansson is touching, and the last 30 minutes are genuinely poignant.  I think the reason this film has been so praised is because it is so different from most commercial Hollywood movies out there.  But I remember the movies from approximately 1967 to 1981, and believe me, this is what they used to be like before Spielberg and George Lucas infantilized them and dumbed them down.  Characters and stories were allowed to be complex and adult, like a good short story (like this film.)  People saw the name &quot;Coppola&quot; on this film and got nostalgic for a time when movies still mattered to grown-ups.  This movie isn't in the same league as &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  But's it's definitely in the same honorable tradition.

$REVIEW.: I will not go as far to say I hated this adaption but I very much disliked it. (Which I don't say too often about movies). First off, I was confused the first 5 minutes of the movie because the opening scene is about the halfway point of the story. Then it goes into 'flashback' scenes as Jane is 'remembering' what happened. Second, the story line was very rushed, lots of information was skipped and many characters left out. Third, the acting was only so-so and lacked the emotions that the characters should posses. Overall, it was a weak interpretation of the book and I probably won't make the effort to watch this one again.

$review_text.: For starters, the makers of MUNICH assume viewers will possess a certain knowledge base about the tragedy of the 1972 Olympics. For younger viewers, the documentary ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER is a great way to get up to speed.As for this movie, it's based on the book VENGEANCE, by George Jonas. That volume's verisimilitude has been questioned in some quarters. Given its subject, that's unsurprising. However, an NPR interview with a Mossad veteran kept sticking in my mind while watching MUNICH. The agent chuckled merrily at the notion of Israeli agents paying large sums of money for information, as opposed to just doing the intelligence gathering themselves.So when MUNICH starts with the dreaded "Based on real events" tagline, I was already wondering if Spielberg just wanted both free artistic license and a certain credibility. But before I get in too deep here, let me hasten to say that this movie is quite well made and worth watching. Look elsewhere for plot details; for my part, I found the movie very interesting and pertinent.SPOILER ALERT: Tony Kushner's screenplay adaptation explores the issues of conscience and doubt for our assassins, but particularly reprehensible was his intercutting of our protagonist making love to his wife with shots of Israeli athletes being slaughtered in Munich. That seemed gratuitous and sicko-sexual to this viewer.

The crimes are shocking and graphic. For me it was almost soft porn.  So weird to see C. Thomas Howell in such a sinister role.  I actually think the actors should have switched roles.  Howell looking more like Buono and the other looking more like Bianchi.  This film is not for the faint of heart and is not supposed to be.

$REVIEW.: I can't understand the other low ratings given this film. I found the pace wonderful without the usual American action-every-second and constant loud music or sound effects. Instead, this film delivers beautiful cinematography and the use of wind interspersed with occasional music that preserves a renaissance feel (even played on period instruments). I wonder if this film was produced by the same makers of &#34;Renoir&#34; - another film using the sound of wind and beautiful scenes coupled with minimal dialogue.One does not need a raging Mel Gibson to see a tragic figure destroyed by a conservative and cynical power. Mads Mikkelsen is superb in this film and does more with facial expression than most can do with words or actions. The minimalist script seems appropriate to the message of the film and conveys the silent strength of the leading character.My guess is that those who are bored with this film are simply too enmeshed in American action films. I plan to rent this again and to watch in the same way one might play a symphony a second time. I think of this film as art, more than mere entertainment. others may need a high decibel level to achieve the entertainment they want.Watch this film, but be patient. Don't work on you device while watching and enter another time and world and enjoy a tragic play that does have a predictable ending (but don't all tragedies?).

$REVIEW.: `Beauty and the Beast' is one of those films that has stood the test of time and it still feels as well made and delightful as when it was first released. Now it is re-released in blu-ray splendour you can relive it's magic again and again.Belle lives in a French village and loves nothing more than a good book and when the local Casanova Gaston (who is odious and vain) tries to take her hand in marriage she can think of nothing worse. Her father stumbles across a deserted castle inhabited by a gruesome beast, who is really a prince under a spell, and when Belle goes to rescue him she ends up being held prisoner herself. Over time Belle and the beast develop a love for one another and when Gaston comes to kill the beast the story is brought to a head.Of course there is slightly more to the story than that, but that is the rough outline and gives an idea of what you can expect here. The animation is very well done in this film, as it's Oscar will attest to, and the backgrounds are rendered with a level of detail Disney films have lacked in recent years. The use of light is very good as well, especially in the castle where the shadows and pools of light are very well done.This has decent enough music and isn't too twee and the voiceover work is also very good. I especially enjoyed Angela Lansbury as the teapot and thought she matched the character perfectly.This has become a classic in the Disney stable for a reason and if you haven't watched this yet you should be pleased with the story and animation on offer. This has plenty of extras, most of which are aimed at kids, but the commentaries and `making of' featurette are of special interest to adults and give a deeper insight into the film. Overall this is a great package with excellent remastering and is another wonderful film to add to your Disney collection.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

$REVIEW.: You could call DANCER IN THE DARK an "anti-musical," but that might suggest that musicals up until this point have been a kind of static genre that needed this kind of corrective.Actually, since at least CABARET and likely before, musicals have been less about "Let's-put-on-a-show" than "Let's-explore-the-dark-side-of-our-souls."  There hasn't been anything in the way of cinematic Sondheim so far, but from NEW YORK NEW YORK to HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH, film musicals have been getting less and less sunny and more and more ominous in recent decades
 In light of that history, how radical a departure is DANCER IN THE DARK really?  The sordid "reality" vs


the musical "fantasy" is not all that new
 The television version of PENNIES FROM HEAVEN did it at least as well.The film's almost naturalistic reality sequences become almost as surreal as the musical fantasy sequences by the last third of the film


 While there is some internal logic to Selma's refusal to participate actively in her own defense, there is clearly no reason why others (her friends Kathy and Jeff, in particular) would have not been able to come to her aid more effectively


The trial and subsequent prison stay and execution are meant to be stark and disturbing
 To some extent these scenes succeed in that, but there is much about the last hour or so that just does not ring true--even in the stylized and distorted sense of "truth" that von Trier is trading on here.The reviewers who complained about von Trier's "anti-Americanism" make a point

 European audiences, for instance, may eat this stuff up (it did win the Palme d'Or after all), but American viewers might find it way an un(der)-nuanced representation of American culture and our legal system, even if it's the culture and  legal system of 40 years ago.On the other hand, as anti-death penalty films go, it is at least as good as DEAD MAN WALKING and much subtler and more effective than LAST DANCE
 Like those films (and so many other Death Row dramas), however, DANCER does give its talented cast a chance to shine


 Bjork's cinematic debut is impressive (and it's a real shame that the experience proved so traumatic that she has foresworn acting from now on)
 Catherine Deneuve is quietly effective (although still a touch too glamorous for her role as an immigrant factory worker)

 And it's always nice to see David Morse in a substantial role

Von Trier is a good director of actors
 Time will tell if he'll prove to be a great director overall.

$review_text.: Had this been a B-level ppv show, such as a Night of Champions or Extreme Rulez, this would have been considered only a slightly below average show

 But when one takes into account the fact that, buyrate wise, SummerSlam is the WWE's 3rd biggest event of the year (and their biggest event of the summer), it is unfair to say that this was a remotely good show
 As far as SummerSlams go it was one of the worst there's ever been
 In my opinion, only the 1989, 1990, and 1996 editions were worse than this one


 There were only two good matches on the show, and one of them had one of the worst and most destructive finishes (business wise)that there has been in pro wrestling in a long time
 In conclusion, do not buy this dvd

 Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).1) Intercontinental Championship MatchDolph Ziggler (c) w/ Vickie Guerrero vs


Kofi KingstonThis was a weird one, and not particularly good

 They wrestled for about 6 or 7 minutes before starting to go into some near falls, which the crowd got into, but other than that this was as basic as it gets

 Dolph then locked on a sleeper, was about to win, seemingly, and then Nexus came out and destroyed Kofi, thus ending the match in a no contest
 Normally this would have bothered me, but considering this was built as a one match show, it helped get Nexus over that much more and I was fine with that


 Plus nobody paid to see this match anyway


 *1/22) Diva' sChampionship MatchAlicia Fox (c) vs
MelinaI have seen worse women's matches, but this was quite atrocious
 Half-way through the match they worked a spot where Melina acted as though she hurt her knee agai, almost like a shoot, but then seconds later she jumped off the top rope and sold no pain whatsoever
 Even funnier than that, was that Alicia saw her "injure her knee," and then proceeded to work over her upper body
 I laughed
 Melina won with a move that nobody thought was her finisher and she got no reaction...I mean zero

 Bad match


 DUDAfterwords Laycool came out and wound up beating up Melina because she didn't want to take pictures with them


 Yee Haw.3) 3 on 1 Handicap MatchBig Show vs

S.E.S


(CM Punk, Luke Gallows, & Joey Mercury) w/ SerenaThis fued has done nobody any favors, and Big Show won what was basically a squash match

 Really nothing to it and the crowd did not care at all

 Show basically took turns beating on them, and aside from a short period of time when they tried hurting his hand, this was all Big Show
 Not a bad match per say, just a nothing match


 *1/2After this ordeal the Miz came out and cut a SUPERB promo, essentially saying he was going to join Cena's team


 This was, in all honesty, the best part of the entire show

 If you actually make the mistake of buying this dvd, watch this and nothing else.4) WWE Championship MatchSheamus (c) vs

Randy OrtonThe first good match on the show

 Not a really good match, but good enough

 Match started out extremely slow, and extremely boring

 It was every Randy Orton/ Sheamus match you've ever seen


 Lots of stomps, etc...However, it built pretty well and the last 5 minutes or so were very heated and enjoyable

 Right when the match was peaking, however, Sheamus brought a chair into the ring, got tangled with the ref, and was disqualified
 What a horrendous finish this was


 This wasn't even a B-show finish, not to mention the finish to a WWE Championship match at SummerSlam
 Just appalling, and the crowd HATED it, especially considering how awful the show had been so far


 After the match, Orton went insane and RKO'd Sheamus on the announce table, but it didn't break

 That had to suck


 Match was pretty good but would have been much better and higher rated had it not been for the offensively terrible finish

 ***5) World Heavyweight Championship MatchKane (c) vs
Rey MysterioKane brought a casket with him to the ring, just to make sure everyone on earth knew that Undertaker would come out of it later

 Very average world title match

 Crowd was absolutely dead silent during the whole match, and the announcers even made note of the "hush" that fell over the crowd

 I laughed


 Every Kane/Mysterio match you've ever seen


 Kane eventually hit a chokeslam for the win
 **1/4Kane went to put Mysterio in the casket, when to everyone's (no one's) surprise Undertaker came out
 He teased attacking Rey, but then let Rey go and tried Chokeslamming Kane

 But, you see, Undertaker is not as strong as he once was, due to his stay in a vegetative state, and Kane was able to power out and Tombstone his brother


 Crowd did not like this or know what to make of it, but to be honest this was at least an interesting twist.6) Team WWE (John Cena, Bret Hart, Edge, Chris Jericho, Daniel Bryan, R-Truth, & John Morrison)vs.Team Nexus (Wade Barrett, Skip Sheffield, David Otunga, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, Michael Tarver, & Darren Young)Daniel Bryan replaced Miz before the match started, as everyone knows
 Very long match, 35 min +
 This was the best match on the show, and it was very good, but at the same time it really was nothing special and probably below the standards of what a usual SummerSlam main event should be

 Most everyone looked good, even Bret Hart for the brief amount of time he was in

 Otunga, however, was freaking horrendous
 Like, he can't even run the ropes

 Just terrible

Slater, Gabriel, and even Sheffield (shockingly) all impressed me

 Unfortunately, the finish was absolutely horrific

 The last thing in the world WWE should have done was beat Nexus clean in their first ppv match, and that's exactly what they did

 It came down to Bryan and Cena against Gabriel and Barrett

 Miz came out and murdered Bryan with his briefcase, and then it was down to 2 on 1


 Gee, I wonder what's gonna happen now
 Cena got beat on for almost 10 minutes, including a DDT on the exposed concrete on the outside
 Then Gabriel missed his 450 splash, got pinned, and Barrett ran in, walked right into an STF, and tapped clean in the middle of the ring in a couple seconds

 Just wretched

 I mean, vomit starting to rise up your throat wretched

 WWE better start getting some heat back for Nexus, because this finish hurt them quite significantly, in my opinion, and was just another example of WWE being terrified to put young talent over established stars


 ***1/2, but with the right finish it could have been more.What a disgraceful show this was
 Stay as far away as possible


 This was the 23rd SummerSlam and it was easily one of the top 5 worst there's ever been.

$REVIEW.: This is not horror, this is not art house. It is one pretentious idiot's attempt to shock and disturb a culture that refuses to be labelled as anything but what it is - apathetic and stale. The belief that there is some deep, artistic vibe to these short films can only be interpreted as such by university students who have lived off mum & dad's money for too long and think they are bad-ass because they smoke marijuana between lectures. The director stated that it took him 8 years to make this series - probably because his parents stopped giving him money to smoke drugs between uni classes.

$review_text.: Every once and awhile, a movie will come along that'll make you laugh, and gross you out, all at once...Dead and Breakfast is just that kind of movie

I didn't really know what to expect when I bought this movie, I half expected it to be another horror/comedy that falls flat when it comes to the jokes
After the first 10 minutes I was cracking up! Some of the most hilarious moments involve the character Johnny, and a head that he wears on his hand and uses as a puppet

Also the redneck that sings/raps threw the entire movie will entertain you.While watching it, you can tell that most of the budget went to the special effects and gore, which is VERY good, considering how low the budget was for this movie

It doesn't really get gory until the middle of the movie, but once the first drop of blood is spilled, it'll stay gory till the end

Most people assume this is another zombie movie, where the corpses are slow and stupid...they aren't, in fact, they aren't even zombies, their possessed dead people, and they're pretty smart.The main group of actors (Ever Carradine, Gina Philips, Oz Perkins, Bianca Lawson, and Erick Palladino) do a really good job

Ever Carradine makes a good Heroine, as does Gina Philips, but Palladino makes this movie memorable, with his wise cracks, and all around hilarious dialog
Some of the supporting acting is pretty silly, but that is expected, Diedrich Bader, in particular, plays a pretty silly role


David Carradine plays a small, but important role in this film as well

The comic book esque transitions are pretty interesting, and they keep the movie flowingThere really weren't many slow spots, Dead and Breakfast held my attention the entire time! (which is a pretty hard thing to do)

This movie isn't for everyone, some people will find it silly, and stupid, but most will find it to be a fun campy movie, in the tradition of Dead Alive, Evil Dead, and Shaun of the Dead

All and all, I loved it, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a less then serious horror movie
Like the cover says "It's like a bad horror movie, only worse!".The special features are pretty basic, Deleted scenes, Commentaries, Bloopers, you know...all the usual stuff
The bloopers are pretty funny! The most unique special feature is the extra music option...it has some of the unused songs of the film

There are 2 commentaries for this movie, one with the crew, one with the cast and both are pretty funny

All in all the special features are pretty good for a low budget movie.



$SUMMARY.: For it's great gore, unique plot, and its amazingly funny scenes, its a film worth checking out!

$review_text.: Clint Eastwood is the man when he shows off his act of intimidation, whether he would be a traditional cowboy, a cop, a retired boxer, or a racist war veteran.  "Pink Cadillac" proved to me that if he tries to be anything besides a silent brute, he's out of his element.  Watching his attempt at being funny in a zany action-comedy is nothing short of embarrassing; not to say he's never been an amusing character for his other films, but his humor mostly stems from cynicism, and him trying to sash-talk his way against a spunky love-interest in this film didn't work for him.  From dressing a rodeo clown and a casino king (who looks like a bleached John Waters) to mocking a woman's voice, his delivery towards these 'funny moments' are poorly handled.The film is about a master-of-disguise bounty hunter named Tommy Nowak, though he called himself a 'skip tracer' but if he's off chasing criminals so he can sent them to court for cash, that sounds like work of a bounty hunter to me.  He reluctantly goes after an escape fugitive named Lou Ann (Bernadette Peters), who was inexplicably involved in collecting counterfeit money which were actually responsible by her jerk of a husband and the Birthright, a type of Aryan brotherhood.  The money's in her [movie title], which the Birthright was after, but Nowak found her first. He decided to protect her and keep her hidden from the law, presumably because she was cute in "The Jerk"; otherwise, he had no real reason to have a change of heart from being a typical stern bounty hunter besides romantic convenience.  He gets involved in the Aryan's battles, leading into weak car chases and a haphazard conclusion.Although this probably Eastwood's weakest film in his repertoire, the film is not bad.  It's simply corny, particularly with the acting.  Again, Eastwood's comedic performance didn't go in his favor and Peters tried to be compelling with her sugary lisp voice, and the result of that is quite sour. The biggest offense were the bad guys, who were reaching the expertise of B-level cinema.  Malposo-produced films usually have cold and relentless antagonists, but the enemies in this movie are cartoonishly evil that they put me at a distance.  The leader of the Birthright, Alex, is so over-the-top, it's like I'm watching an bad 80s action film.  Maybe that's the idea of this film, but it didn't succeed in delivering the camp factors.  The whole film felt like a middling effort, but at least it had the grace of showing a young Jim Carrey doing stand-up, which showed how little he changed over the years.

There are some survivors....some are injured severely, some with little physical problems. They must learn to work together as a community to work toward essentials t o continue to live, and hopefully be rescued.Over the course of the season, the backgrounds of one of the characters who survived is featured each week...and how they wound up on the flight plays into the story.

I don't know really what to say here because everyone else has already said everything
Some of the beginning made a little sense because I have seen "Life Of Brian" which is the exact opposite of this film


So I might have learned some things already


I do have many questions about it, though


I get why so many people were offended
Because Jesus sinned in some way
Throughout the movie, he kept praying that he, along with a few other folks would be forgiven, but THAT'S where I get confused
Oh well
I'm surprised I did understand SOME things, and yet, it's very interesting.

$review_text.: Remade less successfully as Pure Luck, the first of Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu's three teamings for writer-director Francis Veber, La Chevre is still the best of the bunch. Richard's the idiot accountant assigned to find a missing girl in South America simply because he's every bit as accident-prone as she is, while Depardieu's the worldly private eye who has to pretend to be working for him while really running the case and trying to keep him out of trouble. You can pretty much fill in the gaps from there, but that doesn't make it any less funny. Richard's pratfalls work not just because they're unsensationally directed rather than heavily telegraphed (one even takes place out of focus in the background) but because, like Clouseau, Richard's character doesn't know he's a clumsy idiot. In fact, he thinks he's the epitome of cool and control. But it's Depardieu who really makes the film, his underplayed exasperation and beautiful reaction shots easily the funniest thing in the film, especially as he realises with increasing fatalism that Richard's bad luck is starting to rub off.Kino's DVD transfer suffers from being a standards conversion from PAL, which is acceptable but has some blurring not present on the Australian DVD (where the film is also available on a triple-disc set with Les Comperes and Les Fugitifs).

We probably have "March of the Penguins" and Lord of the Rings' trained horse scenes to thank for since they proved live-action/non voiceover(not another Michael J. Fox voiced mutt) still makes box office. I had a husky so I'm very partial to the magnificent 8 beautiful specimens. Huskies and Malamutes are much more subdued and stoic than the average yapping mutt. Their fur allows them to sleep in the chilly snow as comfortable as a blanket. It's been a long time if ever they were made the forefront dog actors proving they can act. I remember the last "Call of the Wild" remake I saw(with Heston?) had a yellow mutt that was totally wrong for the role of Buck.

$review_text.: This 1966 film is one of those Cinerama epics that were popular in the sixties.  The stars cast in leading roles, Charlton Heston and Laurence Olivier, were popular too.  The story is based on an incident from British history when, in 1885, General Charles Gordon was sent to the Sudan to protect British interests.  It's over-simplified and filled with Gordon's heroism and I question its historical accuracy.  But that was not the only reason I didn't like it.Charlton Heston is cast as General Gordon.  He never quite gets the British accent right.  And, as the script called for more than just leading the troops into action, he just couldn't get any real emotion into his long and boring conversations.  His whole performance was wooden.  Laurence Olivier was cast as "The Mahdi", a Moslem religious fundamentalist.  But dark makeupand a turban could not hide the fact that he's a well-known British actor in costume.  He sure is no Osama ben Laden.The story dragged so much that I actually fell asleep several times, missing some of the plot.  I woke up for the battle scenes though with their casts of thousands, camels, swordplay and unrealistic death scenes.At 134 minutes, it was much too long and there weren't even features on the DVD to give any background. Clearly, I disliked this miscast epic.  Except for a bit of good cinematography it is not worthwhile on any level.

Do i want to spend the amount of money for all 4 seasons of the Tudors, from what the reviewers have stated the history of this series is not up to par. No matter what, you can not change history. Even in fiction series. So i have chosen not to buy all four seasons cause, i would not be able to enjoy the series. Sorry but the history we know of the Tudors is not boring, nor is it lame. Had the creators of this series stuck with the true historys of the Tudors i would be more then happy to purchase this Series. Maybe Hollywood and Cable will think about adding fiction too the historys next time. Once again thank you to the reviewers for helping me with my choice.

$REVIEW.: NOTE: This review contains NO spoilersOk, so they hyped it wrongly


From what I have seen of other reviews, many, many people were expecting this to be a horror film, full of thrills and chills and abominable monsters

But I understand that to a degree--the trailers misrepresented the true nature of The Village


What I find amazing is that many turn around and lambast it for a boring, dull, stupid, and in every way inane movie.Let me tell you...I wasn't expecting a horror film, but I was expecting something different from what I got

What I got, however, turned out to be one of the best movies--if not the best movie--I have ever seen in my life.First of all, it was directed by M


Night Shyamalan
This of its own accord nearly guarantees that the movie will not be bad


He has an impressive track record--The Sixth Sense was superb, Unbreakable was a bit slow but still not bad, and Signs was both a decent alien movie and an excellent story of a man whose faith stagnates and then is revived


The Village, however, trounced them all
He proves as masterful an artist here--if not more so--as ever


His directing is wondrous--you are fully engrossed in Covington Village and its people, and he makes you care about characters who are 3-dimensional, as opposed to Hollywood's typical fare.In one area of this film I think I will have few detractors--the brilliant, moving debut of Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy Elizabeth Walker, the spunky, pretty leading lady of the film
Watching the film it is amazing to think that Shyamalan introduced himself after seeing her in a stage production of Shakespeare's As You Like It, and landed her in her first major film role
Her performance is stunning, and I will be disappointed if she does not earn an Oscar for it
She deserves every ounce of it.Joaquin Phoenix as the lead male role, quiet, short-spoken Lucius Hunt, once again proves that he is a versatile actor


Leaving behind him a record of playing the merciless Roman emperor Commodous in Gladiator and the slightly deadbeat Merill Hess in Signs, he appears in The Village playing a completely different part with excellence

Mr

Phoenix is only 29 years old...he has a career cut out for him.All the supporting roles-Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Cherry Jones, and others-are equally good

This was the first film in which I had seen Adrien Brody, and I found his performance as mentally unstable Noah Percy to be quite fine, and without having seen it I can imagine why he got an Oscar for his role in the Pianist.One objection I often see in reviews is that this movie was not scary
Well, no, it wasn't, really, in the killer-with-bloody-knife sort of way, nor was it intended to be
But it was suspensful in plenty

It is bad enough when someone is going into danger, but when that person is a blind woman, things start getting more-ok, I take it partly back-scary


So if you are looking for the sort of scariness that will keep you awake night after night, stay away


But if you are looking for some whopping-good suspense, then you just might be interested

You must be prepared, however, to head into a moving, entertaining, stirring-but mercifully clean-love story, filled with good characters, excellent directing, and some good questions to think and talk about.Oh, and the soundtrack

Superb

Hilary Hahn, the featured violinist, struts her stuff in some really wonderful violin themes

It is very classically based stuff, and extremely good-and very appropos to what it accompanies in the film...which is always a plus.From stem-to-sterm, top-to-bottom, front-to-back, side-to-side, this is an excellent film, and perhaps Shyamalan's best to date
He is going to have difficulty topping this

Instead of blasting him for a boring film maker, please, even if the movie isn't your type, recognize him for the superb director that he is
And for those who haven't seen it yet-my advice to you is see it now


Support this film
I hope that, as friends speak to friends, this film's theatre take will increase

It certainly deserves it.Final warning: I beg of you, do not let ANYONE spoil ANYTHING about this film to you


There are secrets which would be much better to find out as you go


If you know them beforehand, it will spoil it.And now, though it does not really capture the true feeling of the film-enter the woods...if you dare.

$review_text.: I first saw this on TV years ago and it has held a fond place in my memory. When I finally found it on Amazon I was delighted. The movie was as enjoyable as I remembered. Timothy Dalton is a delight to watch with his good old boy Southern accent and a bit over the top portrayel of a corrupt lawman, so believeable, at least for this Aussie anyhow. James Belushi wise cracked and sneered to great effect. Don't buy this expecting an intricate plot, rather buy it with a mind to spending an enjoyable 90 minutes being entertained. I only have one gripe, not with the movie itself but with the information offered at sale. My copy was not a widescreen version but a full frame one. Perhaps this is a minor gripe [you be the judge of that]. It did however detract from the overall enjoyment.

$REVIEW.: ....and better.  By this time the show had really come into it's own.  it had a steady audience, the creators and animaters seemed comfortable with the characters, and the drawing designs for sets as well as the coloring looking crisp and clean.  this season was the birthing of several classic episodes, from the basebal one to the germans buying out Mr. Burns's nuclear plant.  This is the season where the jokes grew to true simpsons quality, which in my opoinon was somewhat of a growing role.  By now, I'm sure the ratings ween't as great as whenit first started,  and I'm usre the tousands of tee shirt sales may have slumped a little during this time,  but what it may have lost in merchandise sales, it made up for the crediblity and in the quality of shows, setting it on the train ride into histroy as one of the longest running shows.  16+ seasons is nothing short of amazing, especially for an animated show.  This is where the road to simspsons history was paved, and it is definitealy a MUST HAVE

$REVIEW.: This is Bob Fosse at his best.  This is a semi autobiographical movie.  Fosse was mounting the musical "Chicago" starring ex wife Gwen Verdon and finishing the film "Lenny" and had a mild coronary.In this film director Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is mounting a new musical starring is ex wife (Leland Palmer) despite the fact she is too old for the role.  At the same time, he is editing a film called "The Standup" (Cliff Gorman).  Like Fosse, Gideon is a womanizer who lives on uppers, downers, Alka Setlzer and cigarettes.  He lives with his star dancer (Ann Reinking - who is considered the quintessential Fosse dancer) and daughter.  During the rehearsals, he has a heart attack.  This begins a series of fantasy sequences and flashbacks all hosted by the Angel of Death (Jessica Lange in the comeback role of the 80's).  This later proceeds into the final sequence which is hosted by Fosse alumni Ben Vereen.This film has many layers to it including a fascinating behind the scenes look at the mounting of a musical and look at the editing of a film.  The "Take Off with Us" number is truly spectacular.  For most of the cast, this is their finest performances.  The technical side is the best.  Tony Walton proves that he is the best set and costume designer with his fantasy sequences.  Alan Heim needs to be credited with creating the music video with his cutting edge film editing.If you to see a master class in film making this is the one to watch.DVD EXTRAS:Commentary by Roy Scheider (Did not listen to this)Interviews with Roy Scheider - very good.Filming clips with Bob Fosse - very good

I'll attempt to apply my vast amounts of reviewing skill to this review in order to convince you why this movie is worth seeing WITHOUT giving away every single thing that happens.So. Has anyone here ever worked a crappy, low-paying service job that required immense amounts of patience and customer service skills not to wring the necks of everyone that came into the place asking stupid questions? This movie is for you. Here lies a collection of anecdotes about all the things that can happen throughout the years working at a convenience store (and a video rental place) all set in the timeframe of one incredible day at work. The customers that ask stupid questions, the things that break and must be fixed, everything that can and will go wrong at once, it's all here. To give away the little things that happen would be to rob the viewer of the enjoyment of watching it happen, so I'll say no more. There are several exaggerated things that happen, comedic moments that we hope are fictional, but at its core what works about the comedy is that there are recognizable hilarious moments that we recognize if we've worked these kinds of jobs before.Holding this film together, there is a relationship between the main character, Dante, (played by Brian O'Halloran) and his girlfriend Marilyn, (played by Veronica Loughran). Their relationship has lasted awhile, and they're hitting some rough spots in trying to see whether it should continue or end immediately. Most relationships hit such a spot, and the revelations they make to each other and the reactions that occur should be recognizable to anyone who's ever had a relationship that hit some rough spots ("I can't believe you never told me that..." "You're overreacting..."). Again, I'm not going to give anything away, but suffice it to say that much of the dialogue here is funny because it's true.So throughout the day, strange things happen, the main characters react, and the relationship problems are discussed. The problems get worse, the tension mounts, and at the end, everything is resolved in such a way that the characters may or may not have learned something. The plot follows the standard film school outline, but the twist is that the whole story occurs in the midst of vignettes that follow the quirky things that can happen throughout a day at a customer service job (with a few fantastical, exaggerated situations) and the little stories are interwoven with the main character's dilemma in a way that I found highly entertaining.The grainy, black and white style of this movie (slightly above surveillance camera quality...no joke) belies the small budget, but I found it effective. It may annoy a lot of people, though, so be forewarned. This movie doesn't look slick and polished. This movie is full of "inappropriate" language. Don't let your four-year-old watch this movie unless you want him to get kicked out or preschool for repeating the dialogue. Lots of people don't like this movie (or any of Smith's movies, come to think of it) because they complain that it has no plot and it's not funny-it's annoying. Keep that in mind. If you don't like the comedy, you won't like the movie.The Bottom Line: I loved it.

$review_text.: As always, Animation looks great in HD and Cars is no exception. When I was able to get the movie to work, the picture and sound were incredible. This is a good disc to keep around in order to show off your system.The reason I have it four stars:I have the Samsung BD-P1200 and it took 5 tries before I was able to get the disc to load. Like Pirates, Fantastic Four and a few other discs, the java menus really overload the stand alone players. I made sure the disc was clean and after the 5th time of opening the tray and re-inserting the movie the player recognized the disc.I'm of the opinion they should lay off the java menus and just stick to the basic menus for these movies.-update-I have purchased the Panasonic DMP-BD30K and it handles this title just fine. From my experience, it appears that some standalones just don't handle the java menus too well.

$REVIEW.: If you are aware of what the series is, and are merely concerned about the particular packaging, worry not, for it is a great set. As far as the series itself goes, this set contains the first half of the series (as of the date this is written, but with high hopes, perhaps one day there will be more seasons of this series) and essentially introduces a bunch of the main characters, while including some of the intensity the series contains, although most of that intensity isn't available until the next season. If you are familiar with the manga, know that the anime detracts from the original version slightly (though honestly, what series doesn't), though there isn't any need for concern, for it is still a comedic/philosophical/unforgettable experience that is well worth owning.

$review_text.: What's the difference between A-list actors and B-list actors?An A-list actor can be in many different movies, and most of the A-list actor's performances are memorable. However, each performance is remembered for its individuality.A B-list actor turns in forgettable performances, and usually isn't in a lot of movies (that are good).Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio and especially Jack Nicholson reaffirm their A-list status with flying colors in The Departed. How many movies have you seen Jack Nicholson in? How after being in so many movies can you keep your performances fresh? My expectation was that I'd go into The Departed and have an experience where the Nicholson character was unoriginal, familiar or unbelievable because the portrayal would be so diluted by other Nicholson performances. So much for my expectation.Nicholson's portrayal of Frank Costello was realistic and refreshing. You don't see Jack Nicholson "in another role"; you see Frank Costello. That's an A-list actor.The movie as a whole was just excellent. A great story. Engrossing. Believable. Suspenseful. And the twists were on target; even though you mostly knew who the rats were and what side they were on, the deceptions effectively keep the viewer slightly confused as to who is really working for who. The movie keeps you captivated from start to finish.The Departed and its Director have been justifiably showered with praise and awards. The Departed is by far the best new movie that I've seen in years. It's a collector; add it to your cart.

$review_text.: The saddest thing about this Belgian film (in Belgian French, subtitled for what it's worth) is not that the two main characters end up wheelchair-bound; it is that I could tell you the whole darned thing in an unusually short time.These two bozos, neighbors who hate each other, end up in a bitter brawl that leaves them pinned by one of the neighbor's farm machinery. Both end up in hospital - in the same room - and both emerge in wheelchairs for life. That is when things get really strange. An inexplicable abandonment of their respective houses, and a trip to Finland with a shocking outcome, pretty much explains this Belgian 'black comedy'.Except it's heavy on the "black" and virtually without comedy.While it has one or two intensely hilarious moments (these two guys are both unbelievably obnoxious and mean), this black-and-white film seems to consist mostly of random cinematic compositions. It's the type of thing I always imagined they assigned to film school students in cinematography 101 or earlier.The black-and-white is tough enough to bear, though I see its reasons. What I cannot bear is that the film MAKES the viewer laugh at people in wheelchairs. When one random fellow screams, "It's people like you who give people in wheelchairs a bad name!!" I immediately thought how true of the filmmakers.This is a 90 minute waste, a strung-together 'cripple' jokebook that in the end is not funny at all. As a man crippled and wheelchair-bound for life, I found it funny as hell in one scene only (see if you spot that scene). It's easy for me to empathize with that anger, grief and a thirst for some sort of vengeance. Yet it is somehow frightening to see it in such mocking detail, and it is because of that I decided to warn viewers away from this thing.All of that, and the fact that this is about two stupid men who put themselves in wheelchairs in the first place.As a wheelchair-bound person, I did not find much sympathy with anything in this film. There is an important symbolism here which ends up being represented by two dolts in wheelchairs. Of course they are enraged about it, which I definitely was when I first landed in my chair. However, one ironclad rule I have: an important message deserves an important delivery system, which this film is NOT.If you want laughs and tears of revolt, Euro-style (read: all the wrong kinds), get the originalDeath at a Funeral (2007). And by the way, Mr. Interlocutor of my original review: it's pretty clear that I not only love cinema but am also something of a historian on the subject - and a definite expert of THIS subject.

$review_text.: 30 Minutes or Less is a really good comedy/suspense
 It's about Jesse Eisenberg playing the part of a pizza delivery boy who happens to deliver a pizza to the wrong house one night involving two nerdy out of shape young men who come up with this scheme to kidnap Jesse's character and deliberately make him go through with a bank robbery
 These men also contact a hitman in case the robbery doesn't succeed for whatever reason, and the hitman plays a huge role in the movie near the end.This is definitely more a comedy than a suspense, that's for sure!  I was laughing pretty much the entire time

 Jesse brings along his friend Aziz Ansari who's equally funny and finds himself in all kinds of comedy segments as well
 Basically the storyline is hilarious because it revolves around several familiar bank robbery/money delivering antics that go *completely* wrong


 A twist on the genre if you will


 A good example is when Jesse and Aziz walk into a bank, tells everyone to get on the floor and when it's discovered one woman has a gun, she tosses it across the room and an innocent man gets shot when the gun hits the counter, which prompts him to yells at HER and therefore takes the attention away from the robbers, lol.Oh, and did I mention Jesse has a bomb strapped to his chest the entire time?  Yeah that's an important element to the storyline!  Sometimes the bomb is used as a way to gain an advantage which you'll find out about later

 Good writing there
 There's several swear words being tossed around, especially by the father of the two guys who come up with the bank robbery plan

 The father had me rolling on the floor with laughter because of his strict military-like demeanor and the ways he'd constantly belittle his own son and his friend, lol.Overall hilarious, well-told and just a lot of fun


 That pretty much describes 30 Minutes or Less..

and this review only took me less than 10 minutes to write.

Sylvester Stallone has given us a movie that nearly comes close to the original "Rocky" (1976) and is the best sequel of the series. His directing and story and screenplay are excellent. The cast led by Stallone is excellent. The music by Bill Conti (who also did the original "Rocky" & the sequels) is excellent. The cinematography by J. Clark Mathis is great. The film editing by Sean Albertson is great. The casting by Diane Heery & Sheila Jaffe (both of them also did the casting to "Invincible" (2006) is great. The production design by Franco-Giacomo Carbone (who also did the production design to the upcoming "Bug" (2007) is great. The art direction by Michael Atwell & Jesse Rosenthal is great. The set decoration by Robert Greenfield (who also did the upcoming "Lucky You" (2007) is great. The costume design by Gretchen Patch is great.

$review_text.: I didn't know anything about the Green Lantern when I bought this movie
 I think that was a plus, no expectations dashed

 I watched the movie on its own terms


 After a confusing start, it gradually grew on me and I began to enjoy the goofy conglomerate of action, flash, and fury


 It was a live action cartoon

 It did exactly what it was supposed to do, entertain


 Yes, at times it was a bit cumbersome, but for all that it still made a statement that worked just fine in the superhero universe
 If I had any concerns it was with the star, Ryan Reynolds


 His predilection for playing smart alecks and jackasses had me worried
 In this case, thankfully, he was toned down


 True, he was still playing a bit of a jerk, but the reckless, braggart at least grew during the course of the film

 At times he appeared appreciatively overwhelmed with his unearned power
 I'm glad they didn't try to make a joke of it

 As for the rest of the cast, I'm puzzled as to why Tim Robbins and (especially) Angela Bassett consented to appear in insubstantial roles that ultimately amounted to nothing and could have been played by anyone to the same effect


 The only actor who got to showcase his talents was Peter Sarsgaard (playing the pathetic villain Hector Hammond).It's by no means a masterpiece

 At best, it can be accused of being merely functional
 I liked it because it hit enough notes to make it worth subsequent viewings

 It's a keeper.

$REVIEW.: While much of Glenn Ford's early 1950s film output are unabashedly 'B' movies (he filled the same niche as Robert Mitchum did, at RKO), his movies are, by and large, very entertaining, and "Plunder of the Sun", shot in Mexico for Warners and John Wayne's Batjac Productions, is no exception. Directed by John Farrow, this action drama offers noir elements (an ambiguous hero, a 'fallen' woman, brutal violence, and an 'expressionist' use of light and shadow), John Huston-like characters (reminiscent of both "The Maltese Falcon" and "Treasure of Sierra Madre"), and an actually pretty accurate look at ancient Indian civilizations that built cities with pyramids when Europe consisted of little more than tribes.Ford is Al Colby, a down-on-his-luck American recruited by rotund Thomas Berrien (Sidney Greenstreet-channeling Francis L. Sullivan) to slip a package through Mexican customs. When Berrien unexpectedly dies, a variety of characters offers Colby money, potential treasure, or his life, in exchange for the mysterious package, which he discovers contains part of an ancient document mapping where a hidden cache of priceless artifacts is buried. Seduced by both beautiful native girl Patricia Medina, who seems involved with all the 'major players', and drunken American 'party girl' Diana Lynn (doing a 'Gloria Grahame' impression), and 'educated' through beatings and genial lectures by the mysterious 'Jefferson' (scene-stealing Sean McClory), Colby teeters between succumbing to the vast wealth the document promises, and 'doing the right thing', and turning everything over to the Mexican authorities, who legally 'own' the artifacts. While Ford's portrayal lacks the subtle shadings of Bogart or Mitchum, he handles the moral dilemma quite well, and he certainly can take a beating!With much of the action filmed at actual Aztec sites, in Oaxaca, Mexico, the film has an authentic 'feel', is fast-paced, and very watchable.Certainly worth a look!
$SUMMARY.: Greed, Buried Treasure, and Glenn Ford, too!

 Peter Dinklage gives a remarkable performance - certainly one of the five best of the year
 Bobby Cannavale makes you want to kill his character only just when you're about to tie him to the tracks you discover that he's grown on you

$review_text.: Folks, if you haven't bought this movie or even seen this movie yet, do not, I repeat, do not waste your time. The movie was more of a comedy than it was horror, and the use of paint for "melting bodies" was atrocious. I can't believe I wasted my money on this garbage. The title of the movie fits it well, at least the "trash" part does. Don't purchase this movie if you value your hard-earned dollar. You were warned. I can't believe that out of 33 reviews, this movie only got two negative reviews. That just goes to show that our culture will watch anything and call it entertainment. Wow, some people are so easily satisfied when it comes to visual and plot entertainment. Not me... I wouldn't have even given this one-star if it hadn't been required in order to post a critique. This movie was worse than awful.

$review_text.: Made at the height of her career, "In this our Life" is one of the more controversial of Bette Davis vehicles. Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel, Davis herself panned the film as overwrought and an emasculation of the novel. She was right but that does not mean that it is not an entertaining piece.Davis plays a shrew on heat who causes havoc to her family. She may seem too intense at first but she adds a shot of adrenalin every time she appears and in fact provides a very raw and uncompromising portrait of a very selfish young woman. Olivia de Havilland plays her sensible sister and the contrast to Davis is effective. The film benefits from good direction from John Huston, an excellent supporting cast and some provocative suggestions of incest between Davis and her decadent uncle played by Charles Coburn.The print of the film is excellent and the package has a great set of extras. Janine Basinger provides a first rate commentary which cleverly points out the film's weaknesses at the same time as noting its strengths. It is interesting that John Huston approved of Davis's portrayal while Jack Warner did not.Given the film was released in 1942, Warner's Night at the Movies focuses on wartime propaganda. The newsreel, mostly without a soundtrack, shows a victory tour of film stars with Joan Bennett, Joan Blondell, Claudette Colbert, Eleanor Powell, Cary Grant and others clearly visible. The short film, "March on, America" collects bits from previous Warner's products to construct America's history, culminating with World War 2.  No doubt that Warner's were masters at recycling their material. The film's original trailer is included and another for an Errol Flynn opus "Desperate Journey", one of those films which contributed to the cynical view that Flynn won the war almost single handed.  For broader entertainment, there is a technicolour film of the Ballet Russe in mint condition and an amusing cartoon set in a zoo.This DVD is great value because the extras are so plentiful and varied.  It is even better value as part of the Bette Davis Volume 3 collection.

The classical music is great, and it is visually stimulating enough that my 2 month old even enjoys watching it!  My 2 year old recognizes the visual presentations and delights in telling us what they are.  It is fun, it is cute, a favorite in our home.  I recommend this to anyone seeking to entertain their children while keeping their sanity ;)  Classical music enthusiasts will delight in this as well!

$REVIEW.: This is simply Walking Dead on steroids. Higher intensity and higher speed, it really is an "A works, so let's make B just like it" Hollywood cliche. The characters are pretty flat, there is no time for development because there's too much action. The wife and kids are rather dull and don't inspire much sympathy because their whineyness keeps endangering people. There is a little hispanic boy they save and tow around, but we know nothing about him. The energies of this film are scattered thin.

$review_text.: First and foremost: 300 is not historically accurate and was not intended to be. Neither is it especially realistic. If you're looking for another "Gladiator" or "Troy" then look elsewhere.What 300 does present is an action-packed, almost comic-bookish dose of pure entertainment. Yes, most history-snobs will hate it (and I am a history snob so don't bother flaming me) but 300 is still appealing on several levels.Most striking was the cinematography; that alone makes 300 worth watching at least once. On that level, the film has a more "artistic" quality than other more "realistic" works. As for plot . . . well, the story is what it is. I think anyone who would consider buying this movie probably knows the story of Thermopylae. It's a great story even without all the special effects and fanciful heroics. (Personally, I think the telling would have been more powerful without the quasi-fantasy aspect, but that's just me).No one is going to win any acting awards for this movie but I thought there were a few moving moments in the film. But there's a significant cheese-factor too, which can't be ignored.Overall, I was disappointed with the movie. I knew it was based on a graphic novel and had adjusted my expectations accordingly but, even so, I had expected something more for all the hype. Oh, I'll still buy it (because it's Thermopylae after all and, as I stated above, I'm a history-snob) but I think it could have been a much better movie if there would have been more attention to substance and less to appearances. (I think I groaned out-loud when they threw in the war-rhinos...I mean, come on...)In the end, 300 is just an average film: entertaining on a (mostly) superficial level but lacking in many aspects. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. Sorry, but it's just not the orgasmic masterpiece that so many other reviewers would have you believe it to be.Recommended (with reservations).
$SUMMARY.: Decent 





but disappointing at the same time.

$review_text.: I loved this movie after watching it for the first time today


If the price were not so high, I would buy it (I'm running low).The story was entrancing, fight scenes amazing, and whatever special effects used were good.Other reviewers said they didn't like things such as the seashell throwing, and the blood spraying, but what did they expect? The main character was a budhist monk, and in feudal Japan, monks didn't drive their cars to the local shrine to pray everyday

Many monks in feudal Japan probably did similar things.As to the blood spraying, what good samurai movie doesn't have a little spraying blood


Sure it's a bit graphic, but you see that in many samurai/ninja movies.And finally, I would like to say that the antagonist and protaganist were both demons
It even explained toward the end of the movie why the protaganist (please excuse me if I've switched my terms) was a demon.One thing I did not like about this movie was that a few things were left un-explained
Nothing majoryly important, a few things I suspect were put there for you to think and wonder about.All in all, I think this is a great movie as I said in the title of this review.

There is just enough of Julie naked to keep you watching until the plot unfolds and then you might actually care about what's going on in the movie. She is, of course, a bad ... and a babe and in this movie she shows some emotion. Julie is not some bimbo, like Anne Nicole Smith who couldn't act if she had to, it seems like Julie is really trying not to be just another T&A piece. I do want to mention there is nothing wrong with some T&A, the harder the better. If you are a fan of Julie Strain or even action movies then I would Definately look into this movie.

$REVIEW.: Sergio Leone is unique in his field, and particularly in the western genre. He was in his fourth year of spaghetti western, let's say in full swing, in this film. You know it is Sergio Leone by several elements that do not tell a lie. The music always has the same texture, the same taste, the same sonorities, with the eternal harmonica. Then the landscape, the sunshine, the light, the vegetation and of course practically no fauna, and in this one, not even a snake. Hardly a few horses, a couple of partridges, or whatever, and a pair of chickens. Nothing to brag about. Sergio Leone is concentrating anyway on the human animal and there the menagerie is by far diverse and grotesque enough. Then the economy of the dialogue is also typical because Sergio Leone never uses one word too many when he can do without any word at all. The silences are long and so meaningful that you must be blind not to hear the resounding sense of that emptiness. Then the few words that are actually pronounced become so powerful in their scarcity and rarity that you definitely have to be deaf not to see the subtlety of that sound track. Those are the most significant traits of Sergio Leone's style. And this film is the acme of that style. The plot itself innovates in the subject, that is to say in who the thieves are. In this case some railroad contractor who wants to get rid of some settler who has bought a big chunk of land on the very way where the railroad has to go and who has a contract that allows the railroad to go through for nothing if the station is built before the train can come. You can then imagine the intricacies of the action between several gangs and tribes and bands of good and bad men, bad and good beings, and all the nuances, hues and shades in between. The best detail of course comes at the end when the main bad guy realizes who the one who has just destroyed him is. Don't expect me to tell you. You have to watch the film till the very last five minutes to finally understand. Enjoy it. And if you get the collector's edition you will also enjoy the complementary features on railroads and their advance in and through the west.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

$REVIEW.: This movie almost hits the mark
Its lush and romantic
There are three pieces of eye-candy for the girls (Keanu Reeves in what is probably his worst performance since "Ted"; Cary Elwes who is good, but miscast; and whats-his-name from the Rocketeer) and one piece for the guys- the super sexy Sadie Frost
(By the by, my father never got over her dying her hair black) but these are not the performances worth watching the movie for.Sir Anthony Hopkins is fantastic in the roll of Van Helsing the genius madman doctor, but its Gary Oldman who carries the movie on his talent

I would have crossed oceans of time for HIM (once apon a time...) This movie was meant to be Winona Ryder's big leap from child rolls into adult rolls
It almost happened
Her performance is good but her affected accent hurts sometimes.Still and all, the soundtrack not to pass over Annie Lennox's "Love song for a Vampire" is stellar
Sit back sometimes and just listen to the music.Chills.

When I recieved my copy of the Ultimate Edition, something was wrong

I have a rather slow DVD player so I had to watch something else first to warm it up

But it was worth the wait


I had no idea that they could fit so much extra stuff onto one DVD.Three versions of the film, three documentaries, four trailers, audio commentary, spectacular picture and sound, kick [butt] animated menus, talent profiles, script and a full supplement that will take you until Judgment Day to finish reading
Awesome!Onto Brandon's DVD scale:Movie: 5/5
Arnold's greatest movie ever
Cameron's best too.Picture and Sound: 5/5


As good as it's ever gonna get.Extras: 5/5

They don't call it the Ultimate Edition for nothing.Final verdict: 10

Probably the best DVD ever made
Well, I guess I'll have to wait for the Star Wars movies to be released on DVD before I jump to that conclusion.If you love the movie, you'll love the DVD
Highly recommended

$REVIEW.: Corin Nemec pairs with Director Michael Feifer on their fourth direct-to-video profile of a serial killer. This time the one they chose was Ted Bundy and the movie is not as advertised. Even though their other collaborations have been less than steller, I decided to watch this one, because it was described as a "drama that traces the path of this charming icon serial killer." From that, I was hoping to see a biographical film and that's the way it started out. After a half-hour or so, the film unfortunately descended into a blood bath. Ever since establishing himself with the hilarious teen comedy, Parker Lewis Can't Lose, Corky Nemec has turned to the dark side and seems to thrive on playing these twisted evil men. The former teen idol is terrific and gives a really strong performance, but it was the only thing of note in this film. After introducing us to Bundy, the writers stop focusing on the man and focus on his crimes. For the final hour of this film that's all you see, until a macabre ending which tries to show Bundy as some kind of hero, who never had a chance, because of his circumstances. The man brutally butchered as many as seventy woman, but according to this film, it's not his fault, he's just a child who never grew up. The whole premise of the film was ridiculous, it's a blood bath that tries to make Ted Bundy into some kind of victim and it's a slap in the face to the families of his victims. As much as I enjoy seeing Corin Nemec play a psychopath, I'm done with these snuff films that glorify the most evil men the world has even known.

$review_text.: Martin Scorsese finally won the Oscar the whole world felt he was owed in 2006 when he made this new age crime thriller.  I have never been a huge follower of Scorsese, but I must admit that in recent years I've come to appreciate some of his finer works and have come to see him for far more than just a `gangster' movie maker.  Scorsese actually has a slick resume filled with much more than `GoodFellas' and `Casino'.  While I don't think `The Departed' is his best work (neither is `GoodFellas' or `Casino' for that matter) I can say that I understand why he finally won that directing Oscar and can actually say that his win is justified, despite the fact that sympathy played heavily in his favor.Now, when I sat back to finally review this film I came to a major roadblock.  One of the most rewarding things about `The Departed' is that it is so unpredictable.  Its one biggest flaw (that sloppy ending) is also the films biggest selling point (totally mind blowing in the way it just sneaks up on you) and so reviewing the plot seemed almost pointless.I mean, what can I say without saying too much?Billy Costigan is a cop being placed undercover into crime boss Costello's mob.  Colin is one of Costello's men being placed undercover into the Boston police force.  Neither knows of the other's existence yet almost simultaneously become aware of the other and begin trying to sniff the other out.Along the way lots of people die.Instead of trying to analyze the plot (which I'm sure a lot of you who have yet to see this will thank me for in the long run) I'm going to tell you why this film is worth your time.  Martin Scorsese is a master of the lens and crafts a genuinely intriguing and breakneck paced thriller that never runs too long and never loses you.  Despite everything that gets thrown your way, the film is actually very easy to follow.  It also sports one of the best ensemble casts of that particular year (forget `Little Miss Sunshine').  Everyone involved is really at the top of their game.  Leonardo DiCaprio is stellar here, truly phenomenal, and delivers what may be his finest performance to date.  He is completely aware of what makes Billy so essential to the audience, creating a likable, understandable and identifiable character who is also exciting.  Matt Damon, an actor I am not always sold on, is flawless here.  He doesn't have the same energetic draw that DiCaprio has, but he manages to make his character just as engaging.  Jack Nicholson is `Jack', plain and simple, but who better to play `Jack' than Jack?  As far as the supporting players are concerned, you have wonderfully fleshed out performances from Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and Alec Baldwin; not to mention the glorious Vera Farmiga.Everyone is great.So this brings me to the films drawback; the ending.  I'm not going to divulge anything vital, I promise, but I can't not write about why I can't stand behind this film all the way.  It's a great movie, don't get me wrong.  It's exciting and interesting and engaging, but it lacks something crucial as it draws to a close.  The film just kind of falls apart very quickly.  There was so much time spent really fleshing out the films core that little to no attention was spent on fleshing out the films finale.  It just kind of...ends.  The ending appears almost thrown together haphazardly, and then the obviousness of the final shot was cringe inducing (why oh why did you do that Scorsese).  Up until the last ten minutes or so I was actually thinking this Oscar win was deserved, but there was so much more that could have and should have been done with the ending.It's rather sad really.Anyways, I cannot fault the film too much.  It succeeds in doing so much, and like I said, even though the films ending can be rendered a `flaw' it is also a HUGE selling point (you'll never see this one coming) so in the wise words of Benicio Del Toro, "take the good."
$SUMMARY.: Sure, it gets a little sloppy in the end, but it still delivers a major wallop...

(Mobile Army Surgical Hospital - Korean War)


 The first 2 were high budget, Star Studded and on location


 Mash was low budget, unknown cast and filmed on the Universal Ranch.MASH became the sleeper hit of 1970 receiving 5 Oscar nominations and winning 1 (Best Screenplay).This 2 DVD disk digitally remastered Widescreen (Letterbox)set has an extensive history and background information about the Korean War, Mash Units and the people who served during these difficult times.Actually MASH was an Anti-War film against the Vietnam War, but was done very effectively to be a very Dark Comedy in a war time environment
 With the Humane Medical Teams showing the carnage of War through surgery and the horror of war and death
 The movie conveys the story, cast and war time setting very effectively so we can enjoy the black humor, sex and horror

 We get the message wihout the anti-protesters in our face

 We see how war destroys us one way or another.Summary: The 4077th M.A.S.H


Unit is stationed 3 miles form the Korean front lines


 The Cast of characters are drafted Medical Personell that find a way of serving and existing in this environment through humor, defying authority, sex and friendships
 This movie is fast paced, a highly intense drama/comedy which allows us to enter the combat front through the humanity of medicine and the miracle of life


 The cast is outstanding!You must see this movie

 It is a historical statement of 1970 and it remains a timeless classic!  After all, in 1972 a TV series evolved and remained in our lives for 11 seasons and now in reruns

 Enjoy.

$review_text.: Our two year old is fascinated with all things Tigger & Pooh, so this was on our must buy list. While she doesn't yet understand all the things being said in the cartoon series, she does enjoy the music and watching the activity on the screen.  This DVD didn't disappoint in that respect. She was quite pleased and spent a lot of time dancing around during the musical interludes.  What was surprising to me is that my wife and I also enjoyed the plot !To reiterate, and I'm going to have fun with this,  Rabbit is honorarily appointed Mayor of the Hundred Acre Wood as a goodwill gesture for his organizational skills. Rabbit being Rabbit, he immediately lets this go to his head and, apparently taking a cue from history, turns himself into a supreme leader in the style of Kim Jong Ill and other great dictators in history.  Indeed, during one song, he makes reference to making the trains run on time ( if the Wood had any ); a veiled nod to Benito Mussolini. Poor Eeyor is the only one to initially see the truth, but it begins to dawn on the rest of the inhabitants just what a monster they have created as Supreme Leader Rabbit introduces a series of strict laws that must be obeyed; everything from limiting Tigger's jump time, to restricting Pooh's honey intake. Everything has to be done on a strict timetable dictated solely by Rabbit.  While the rest of the characters take a rather pacifistic approach to Rabbit's oppression, Tigger begins a little insurgency in his own special way which leads to an angry confrontation with Rabbit.  Rabbit then, in a spate of sheer evil ( you can see it written all over his face as he makes the desicion ) , has the 100 Acre Wood divided in half by a line, a'la 1961 Berlin.  Tigger is given control of, in my take on it, the "west", while Rabbit retains an iron grip on his "eastblock" dictatorship with the help of his newly appointed sycophant, Beaver. Rabbit's "utopia" is without freedom; he monitors the actions of all the residents on his side.  While Darby and Buster can travel freely, Rabbit allows no one else to cross the border from either side, even going so far as to assign Beaver the role of Border Guard.  He cuts off free trade, thus dooming the inhabitants of his side to slow starvation ( poor Eeyor ) as most of the food is on Tigger's side of the Wood.  His subjects on this isolated side of the Wood begin to fall into a deep depression brought on by hunger, constant monitoring, and not being able to see their friends on the other side of the line.  Rabbit decides to improve morale with a picnic and music ( I almost thought he was going to broadcast some "patriotic music" akin to what the North Koreans claim they are broadcasting from their non-existant satellite they supposedly fired into orbit earlier this week ).  The picnic is a bit of a bust since there is no food, which drives Darby to finally act.  She creates an incident to draw both sides to reconciliation by having Buster go "missing"( he's really just hiding ), thus forcing both sides to come together in the search.  Once together they realize how much they miss each other and Rabbit releases his grip on the others, has Beaver "tear down the wall" and everything's back to normal.Or is it?  Having seen the dark depths of Rabbit's soul, I wonder if any of the others can truly trust him again.  Personally I think he and Beaver should be arrested and brought before the Hague to face trial for crimes against their own people.  Perhaps they'll be a sequel.OK seriously, it's a fun movie for kids and has enough of a plot to keep Mom and Dad involved as well.  I recommend it!

$REVIEW.: Fans of Lucille Ball or director Douglas Sirk are in for a treat with this one.  Interesting use of genre conventions in plot (even after you've guessed the killer, still fun), nice cinematography which comes up beautifully in Kino's DVD transfer.  Excellent supporting cast, with such stalwarts as Cedric Hardwick and Charles Coburn providing pleasurable backup to star turns from George Sanders and Ball.  Nice to see how many subtle small touches Lucy brings to her characterization, and she looks ravishing, even in black and white.  LURED is a great Saturday night popcorn movie!

$review_text.: While I agree in principle and in some specifics with the review, I have a slightly different take.  Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicles is an excellent story.  The first season is as good as anyone could expect from anime.  And yes, the second season falls short.  However, Tsubasa animation does not end with season two.  Three more excellent episodes called "Tokyo Revelations" in OVA form have been released in Japan by a different studio (awaiting licensing in the US), with expectation that more will follow.  So, if you hesitate to invest in this series because you think it dead ends, keep that in mind.Where I disagree with the previous reviewer has more to do with whether or not one also reads the manga from which the anime is adapted.  I have watched some 150 anime series, but have read little manga.  From my experience, the comparison between novel/movie and manga/anime adaptations is virtually parallel.  If you read books and manga, you should as a rule avoid the movies and anime based on them, because you will usually be disappointed.  An anime I enjoyed, Love Hina, was ruined for ever watching again by my reading the manga, and that adaptation was supposedly a good one.Point being, this is anime, not manga.  Taken on its own, Tsubasa's first anime season ranks with some of the best.  The flaws are minor:  I almost stopped watching because of the horrible audio mix in the first episode.  I literally almost started re-adjusting my sound system, because the music drowned out dialogue.  The music was misplaced, with intense action music playing, and playing continuously, over non-action dialogue, where no music at all would actually have been most appropriate--much worse than any "B" Hollywood movie I've ever watched. Fortunately, either the sound person was replaced or corrected immediately, since by episode two or three the mix was fine.More obvious in season two, but somewhat in season one, are the animation shortcuts: those long pauses for instance.  This becomes ludicrous and laughable toward the end of season two, when I presume the studio had already been informed they would lose the series and so started cutting production costs dramatically.  But somewhat in season one, you'll find yourself actually wondering when the screen will change or someone will say something.I disagee entirely with the season two "Smurfs" comment, however.  That animation style lasts only one episode, is quite humorous, serves the purpose of comic relief, and as such is placed properly.  More generally, if you are looking for pure action or dramatic anime, then Tsubasa isn't what you want anyway.  The series was broadcast at 6:30 pm in Japan, meaning it was intended for family or young audiences (as in the US, anime with more adult themes are aired late night). Though the series, as with many Japanese stories, does get dark at times, overall this anime is a fantasy-romance story with a strong comedic tone.Bottom line is don't hesitate to buy this series because of a comparison to the manga, or because of flaws that become apparent late in season two.  CLAMP, the creators of Tsubasa and one of the most famous manga production groups in Japan, wrote the manga series (still continuing, in fact) as an anniversary gift to their millions of fans, and the quality is definitely there.  Though obviously some of that quality seems lost via adaptation, the anime is still well worth owning, and we can only hope that the new studio behind Tokyo Revelations will continue releasing more episodes.One last word on crossovers:  CLAMP wrote Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles to crossover directly with xxxHolic, another of their manga series still running concurrently (much of the crossover is not in the anime versions).  But more importantly, to enhance the enjoyment for their core fanbase, nearly every character in Tsubasa is actually an alternate version of a character from their earlier works.  While not essential, a previous viewing of Cardcaptor Sakura and Chobits, for instance, greatly enhances the depth or comedy of some scenes and episodes.

$review_text.: After the successful Aks and the blockbuster Rang De Basanti Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra directs this one. Delhi 6 follows Abhishek a half hindu and half muslim to come to India to help his grandmother Waheeda Rehman spend her last days in her birthplace. Set in old Delhi hence the zipcode 6. The movie provides a collage of characters and their brief character sketches and thus remains so. It does not come to the point until the end and then leaves us in a lurch wanting some more.The first half is a gamut of characters from the two brothers Om Puri and Pawan Malhotra, the corrupt politician played by Vijay Raaz, the sultry untouchable Divya Dutta, the wicked money lender Prem Chopra, the idol aspirant Sonam Kapoor and the romantic bachelor Rishi Kapoor, all interesting but underdeveloped characters. The characters interact against the backdrop of a vicious monkey attack which is never solved.The movie meanders towards the end with a very vague ending. Vijay Raaz is excellent, so is Pawan Malhotra, Abhishek Bachchan is getting better; the rest of the cast is completely wasted. The music and the cinematography are excellent. 3stars 12/28/09

$REVIEW.: In the future,  the Persona company owns 90% of the world's surface and rules what they own through a restrictive and violent tyranny


 One of the few bastions of freedom not owned by the Persona company is Shinjuku Tokyo,  The Darkside of Tokyo, the most dangerous place around, but also the one place with true freedom


 Few people stand up to the Persona tyranny, bands of rebel terrorists fight to destroy Persona and their main computer systems located on their space satellite home called Heaven.Fortunes begin to change when a mysterious figure-a man riding with a coach and four horses-arrives from the fourth dimension
 Why is he here? And what is his message of renewal that he brings to the disparate characters of this saga?  He calls himself Darkside, and appears to be a strange mystic that somehow unites characters with a deeper part of themselves.Then there is the single escaped terrorist who seeks haven in Shinjuku and dreams of a world free of control by the Persona corporation, Tatsuya


 His life and mission become tangled up with a band of misfit rebels in Shinjuku, lead by Mai-a street-smart blond woman with an inner core of steel she uses to protect herself from her past

 And he befriends Selia, a troubled woman who's family was lost to the tyranny of Persona


 Other characters abound, almost all of them allowing tantalizing glimpses of their lives, but never quite explaining what it all means


 These characters are never cute or whiny, maintaining a sense of gritty reality in a world gone wrong.I quite enjoyed the story and the ideas presented, but for anyone who is looking to have the questions raised by the anime also answered may be disappointed
 By far the strongest element in this is the characters and their transformation through the story
 Selia and Mai especially dominate the scenes, unusually strong and self-sufficient women for an anime


 There is a bit of frontal nudity (a tortured prisoner) and some rather sadistic violence (of the same prisoner) for the first few minutes of the anime
 Beyond this, most of the violence is fairly tame, with some gun battles and several deaths, but not extremely visually graphic

 The plot never quite crystallizes the way I hoped


 The telling feels more like the opening of a complex story arc that never went any further
 The introduction of "Darkside Blues", performed by a street-player was a decidedly disconcerting addition


 The tune never quite fit the story for me.The artistry is excellent


 Hedeyuki Kikuchi whose talents are also seen in WICKED CITY, DEMON CITY SHINJUKU, and VAMPIRE HUNTER D lends a dark, detailed and slightly gothic edged style to this futuristic anime

 The dub on this particular video is decent, although at times the translation feels a little too obscure, and I'm hopeful to find a subtitled version to compare.Looking for a clear-cut story?  This probably isn't for you


 But if you're a viewer who likes the unusual side of anime and enjoys character development and the artistry of anime, I recommend you check out this particular anime.Happy viewing!  Shanshad ^_^

Watching the Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre series is all new to me. I received my set on Friday and have watched 2 of the 4 DVD's of Zane Grey Theatre Complete Season One. I have really enjoyed viewing this series and will hate when I have seen the last episode. I WANT MORE!  The writing and acting is outstanding.  I have a new respect for character actors.  The series is QUALITY and the acting is EXCELLENT.  I do not watch any new drama or comedy series that are currently on televison.  The programs just do not compare to the old ones (50's and 60's).  I want the other seasons made  available for purchase soon!

$REVIEW.: This was a rather spectacular (by 60s standards) sci-fi underwater adventure with some of the FX still good even today, an academy award winner leading the cast, and an emphasis on action that made more modern  sci-fi shows such as "Seaquest" look and feel weak and derivative.  Unfortunately, this show ultimately became overly formulaic to the point of exasperating redundancy and it shows through in this collection.In these 13 episodes we have Captain Crane and others brainwashed by aliens into destroying Seaview, Admiral Nelson brainwashed by Russians into destroying Seaview, Crane brainwashed by a re-animated mummy into sabotaging the Seaview, Crane and others brainwashed by a giant, anemone-like seamonster into taking over Seaview, Crane and others brainwashed by more aliens into....hell, I've lost track.Also, it seems the scriptwriters have discovered a new toy, and they wield it like a newly pubescent boy.  That is (drumroll)....the CIRCUITRY ROOM!  Ta-DA!!  Yes, folks, you get to watch at least a half-dozen times back to back as various villains and monsters make their way to this curiously unlocked vital area and wreak havok by pulling plugs and wires while the sub rocks and rolls and sparks shoot out of the consoles for some reason.  Running concurrently will be the liberal use of plastic explosives to blow open hatches in several episodes as well (again, back to back).Further, many of the episodes here are rehashes of the first half of this season.  Nelson has a recurrence of his lycanthropy from an earlier 3rd season episode, another heat monster menaces seaview, more aliens need the sub's reactor, etc.  Then, there are episodes with plenty of stock footage from previous episodes recanned as new stories.  One episode, "No Escape from Death" is composed almost entirely of this footage and almost made me not buy this set, it offended me so badly.  This is just plain lazy writing, and the worst part is that some of these episodes might have seemed a lot better if they had been separated from the others thematically, rather than foisted on an unsuspecting public like some kind of collection.  Richard Basehart seems so frustrated that he rudely snaps out his lines, while Rob Dowdell tries hard not to roll his eyes once or twice if you look close.  David Hedison just looks like he wants the day to be over with.I must make mention of one other aspect of this series.  Since its premiere, we have seen that they keep small arms in various places.  Here is a list of what I've seen so far:1. Arms locker in the bow of the sub.2. Arms room somewhere among the corridors of the sub.3. A pistol in a small compartment next to the control roomentrance.4. Nelson keeps a pistol in a safe in his quarters.5. Crane keeps a pistol in the desk in his quarters.6. A crewman surprised by villains while at work pulls oneout of his toolbox!7. A crewman attacked among storage shelves pulls a pistolout of what appears to be a cigar box(?!!).Why do they bother to arm themselves when they use their weapons on each other far more than on any enemy?  I mean, I hate political correctness as much as the next guy, but this is a bit much.Don't get me wrong, I have some personal favorites here, such as "the Fossil Men" and "the Creature".  "The Wax Men" is an unusual gem here as it really does create a creepy and disturbing atmosphere. As a fan, you can enjoy these as long as you aren't expecting much. Just bear in mind that these are the episodes that gave weight to the harsh criticisms leveled against this show. I had been enjoying these sets immensely, and halfway through the 3rd season, figured my memories of many bad episodes were over-reactions on my part, but this set brings home to  me why the show had been an embarassment to some.  It practically made me feel cheated by the producers.I've read that there are several good episodes in the first half of the final season, so I look forward to it, but must recommend this one (and probably the last half of the final season) to fans and compleatists; if new to Voyage, this is probably not the place to start.Look in remarks and you'll see I was corrected on an error.  Thanks are in order to Mr. Reginald Garrard. I thot Basehart had won the AA for his role in "Moby Dick" with Gregory Peck, but I guess, though nominated, he didn't go home with the trophy.

$review_text.: I was surprised when I first heard the rave reviews and witnessed how much money this film was making... it seems to me, that it would've been much more a &quot;sleeper&quot; The reason is that, compared to most  horror/pyschological horror films, this movie is &quot;slow&quot;. It moves  more like a 3-hour long movie, than an hour and a half or so, and it  contains only sparesly, albeit well-placed, bits of gore. On the whole, the  violence in this movie is only included to tell a story, not give a cheap  thrill. For this reason, and because it seems to me to be a sensitive,  thoughtful look at the possible existense of &quot;ghosts&quot;, I highly  recommend this movie. If movies were assigned personalities, and if  &quot;ET&quot; was cutsie, and &quot;Exorcist&quot; was loud and profane,  then &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; by M. Night Shyamalan is quiet, pensive,  brooding and clever.As for Haley Joel Osment, the 12 year old who plays  9-year-old Cole Sear... there is only one word to describe his acting  abilities: AWESOME. Never, and I mean never, have I come across a youngster  who is as capable of giving such a realistic performance, and of  influencing the mood of the audience to such a degree. Haley has a way of  claiming the screen, and is coupled well with a quickly-maturing Bruce  Willis, who was darkly-mysterious as the tenacious, caring child  psychologist, Malcolm Crowe.By now, you probably know that this movie is  about a young boy who has the very-real ability to &quot;see&quot; dead  people. Consequently, if a child really was capable of seeing such things,  they would be terribly frightened and probably give the impression that  something is very wrong, without necessarily stating what the problem is.  This is where Malcolm comes into the picture... he wants to  &quot;help&quot; Cole because, at the beginning of the movie, Cole appears  to be living the life of an emotionally abused child. And also... Cole  represents the chance to 'redo' the past; a past that has one, rather  large, error in it for Malcolm (one of his patients had a mental breakdown  and committed suicide, after shooting Malcolm in the solar plexus).Even  if you don't think this movie will satisfy your need for constant 'blood,  gore and shocks', see it anyway. It is almost a calming experience, when  compared to the gaudy, LOUD horror movies that are flooding the market,  and, to me, a welcome change.Congratulations, Bruce and Haley, on this  awesome landmark film!

$REVIEW.: Yet another in a long string of great MST3K episodes brought to us by Rhino Home Video.  This episode was the first one of season 3, and marks the beginning of the glory years of MST 3K, that lasted until the end of their Comedy Central days.Here is the story:Miles O'Keefe as Ator, The Fighting Eagle, gambols about in this charming mixure of Pre-historic and Medieval Europe.  He, along with mute oriental sidekick Thong, are contracted by a prehistoric scientist (the "really dull old guy") and his daughter to find some sort of a weapon-type-thingy that has fallen into the hands of an evil guy in a bizarre headpiece (the "John Saxon type guy).  The evil guy and his hordes of barbarians capture them at one point, but they escape and use a variety of absurd devices to defeat the bad guys (Ator actually builds a hang-glider and flies around dropping bombs on his enemies!).  I'm not sure what happened at the end, but an overly dramatic narrator mumbles something, Ator rides off into the sunset, and then there is an explosion and a mushroom cloud rises on the horizon.  Huh?Another strange movie.  This one was teeming with continuity errors and ridiculous elaborately named props that are wonderfully lampooned in two host segments.  This movie also introduced me to Film Ventures International, who apparently take movies and put different credit sequences on them that have absolutely nothing to do with the actual film.  I wonder why?A great episode, and highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I remember wanting to see this movie for the mere fact that Scarlett Johansson was staring and I totally adore her.  The movie hadn't received the grandest of reviews and so I stayed away until a few weeks back my wife and I decided to rent it.  I must admit that, while I can understand to a degree some of the bad press, it truly is far from a horrible mess.  The film is shockingly engaging and in the end I found that I enjoyed myself my more than I thought I would.Based on Oscar Wilde's play `Lady Windermere's Fan', the film follows a young married couple, the Windermere's, as they settle into their home in Italy.  Young Meg is infatuated with her successful husband Robert and trusts him indefinitely.  That works to her advantage, especially when Mrs. Erlynne moves into town.  Notorious for conniving her way into the lives of married men, the town is obviously up in arms about her arrival.  She quickly becomes the talk of the town.  Meg, having met her, doesn't understand why there is so much gossip to be had, but when it becomes common knowledge that her husband has been spending unnecessary amounts of time with Mrs. Erlynne, even giving her money, she begins to worry for her marriage.There is more to `A Good Woman' then the synopsis that I just provided.  There is much more to Mrs. Erlynne alone than meets the eye.  In fact I never would have guessed how this movie would end, and I think that's why I liked it all the more.One major plus to this film is the marvelous Tom Wilkinson.  His performance as Tuppy, the successful bachelor who tries to woo Mrs. Erlynne for himself, is seriously best in show.  I only wish he had been in every scene.  Wilkinson is always top notch, that's for sure, and here is obviously no exception.  Mark Umbers is rather forgettable as Robert Windermere, but thankfully the film isn't that interested in him aside from a prop character.  The film is much more concentrated on the jealousy building in his wife and the mystery behind Mrs. Erlynne.  Stephen Campbell Moore does a fine job playing Lord Darlington, the young suitor obsessed with having Meg to himself.  His performance, while not award worthy, is memorable and natural.  He has a natural charisma and charm that is befitting.The two female leads are both adequate as well.  Scarlett Johansson, while not giving her finest performance, delivers as Meg a character that is nave and trusting yet guarded in a way.  By the end of the film she is forced to find herself even if it means falling flat on her face.  She manages to pull this off well.  Helen Hunt, many have jested, is too old for this role.  I agree, yet have to disagree.  I actually really enjoyed her performance.  She looks ancient here, older than she really is, and I found that odd.  You'd think they would have made her look younger for the purposes of the character, but they don't.  Regardless, she nails the performance in my opinion.  I love her chemistry with Wilkinson especially, even if he steals the scenes.In the end I felt that `A Good Woman' was a good movie, one that is rewarding in its own ways.  Sure, it's not phenomenal and it's certainly not the best period piece to come around in recent years, but it manages to deliver a solid 3  star movie that is fun and exciting and something that the whole family can enjoy.

$REVIEW.: Residents of a small town develop a fatal obsession with spirals

 Teenager Kirie is the first to notice some of her neighbor's quirky behavior and even smiles as one man explains his attraction to spirals to her father


 Then the deaths start (washing machine, spiral staircase) and the mutations (giant snail/humans, a girl with medusa like curls) and Kirie realizes that she's not in Kansas anymore.Instead of high-tailing it out of town Kirie and one of her friends try to get to the bottom of the mystery, but that ends up a very, very bad mistake since this movie wasn't made in Hollywood and there's no guarantee that the good guys will win or even end the movie with any of their bones intact

 What a refreshing idea!Visually one of the most impressive and original movies I've seen in years
 Dark, creepy, beautiful, apocalyptic it's almost like a 90-minute Tool video

$review_text.: Look, it's often cheesy, contrived, and poorly edited. Sappy as hell, too- but god help me, I love this show. Part of it's the nostalgia, part of it's Richard Dean Anderson (who has a sly sense of humor about himself that helps to smooth over some of the flaws), but mostly, I think, it's getting to watch a show that revels in its lead's intelligence. Too often we're told that brute strength is the only way to be a "real man," the only way to be the sort of hero anybody can look up to; to get someone who succeeds because he's clever and reads a lot- that's just too cool for school.The kid I was loved it. I'm just glad that the (sort of) grown-up me loves it just as much.

$review_text.: This would be a difficult film to watch on the big screen but it works out fine on the small screen.  It is tough to say what I really think without providing spoilers but here goes.It works on the DVD because the extra features showing how the movie was made and on such a low budget(basically a husband and wife made it in their spare time with two unknown actors) makes the movie a lot better than it is.The beginning says that the movie is based on a true story and the director explained that he got the idea from a newspaper story he read.  The story is about a couple scuba diving on a vacation that get left out in the ocean by their boat.  While you watch this unfold you want to scream how stupid the people are that leave them there.  There were only 20 divers on the boat and they should have counted all the divers and called them all by name.  Additionlly after the people are left, you can see that there is an empty space where their air tanks should be and that their extra stuff is still there under the bench.That said, the movie is mostly about two people that are stranded in an extremely dangerous situation and how they slowly take it in that they are stranded in the middle of the ocean with the possibility of them becoming a shark's meal before they are rescued.  There are some really tense moments, especially when the two drift apart after falling asleep and the woman wakes up frantic that she is alone.
$SUMMARY.: A good DVD if you watch the extra features

$REVIEW.: This is a huge wake-up call to how our &#34;food&#34; is made and what is in it. I know there is skepticism on the actual damages that GMO's cause, but there is no denying that plants were doing just fine without bioengineering. They say they want to feed the world with GMO's and it will stop world hunger, but GMO's have been around since 1996 and there is still world hunger. It all boils down to how food is distributed. I've completely cut out all processed foods, including meat and dairy and I've lost 35lbs in 3 months. It wasn't easy because GMO's are in everything. But there are food companies out there who do label there foods and take pride in using non-GMO ingredients. This movie really helped me make the right decisions about what I put in my body. And besides if GMO's aren't so bad why can't they just label them? That's all we want. We're not asking them to stop making them, just label them. Simple as that. This movie is a huge eye-opener. Must watch!

$review_text.: "Callas Forever" is director Franco Zeferelli's tribute to his beloved diva, Maria Callas. He had directed her in stage productions... and in this wish fulfillment movie, he brings her to a wider audience and she walks in the Parisian sunlight. It's partially a biopic, since it is true Callas had become reclusive in her Paris apartment, popping pills, lost in her past glories, and mourning Aristotle Onassis. Zeferelli's alter ego is a rock promoter, Larry Kelly (Jeremy Irons) He draws Callas out of her shell, persuading her to perform in a cinematic version of Georges Bizet's "Carmen." There is fun behind-the-scenes action; Callas is a diva. Fanny Ardant excellently embodies Callas- her passion for Onassis, song, for life.Zeferelli often portrays Callas&Kelly; acting like an enamored couple. They're genuinely fond&care; for each other. They also live parallel lives... Callas nearly has an affair with her much younger Don Jose, a singer named Michael (played by a real-life Mr. Italy); Kelly has a short-lived affair with a younger painter, Michael. The singer Michael already has a fiancee; the painter Michael moves on to tour the world with his exhibitions. But Callas&Kelly; have each other.People tend to associate Zeferelli with his productions of the Bard:Romeo & Juliet,The Taming Of The Shrew (1967), as well as his epicJesus of Nazareth. "Callas Forever" has a more contemporary setting- in 1977, Callas' final year. Yet the themes of artistry, love, and honesty are timeless. "Callas Forever" is, in some ways, a mixed bag; Larry's affair with Michael gets short shrift; it's not exactly a biopic in following the facts. Still, "Callas Forever" shows that true artists are immortal.

$REVIEW.: It's loud,obnoxious and annoying


There's never a silent moment where the film can just breath or take a break

It's nothing but noise
The life lesson in this TV Film was shoved in our faces so many times that I couldn't take it anymore


The comedy while it worked well in the cartoon, it failed in the live action movie
The villains are either an tired old cliche like oil tycoon or an insufferable cartoony nutacse like Mr.Crocker and Vicki
Infact,the whole acting is over-the-top and cartoony


The story is tried and cliche too

The jokes are lazy,tried and dumb
Not to mention there's also slime humor which I HATE so much
At least with The Last Airbender movie there were some silent moments,villain(s) that were subtle,a subtle morale and best of all, no smile humor


 The only good thing about his film is the guy who played Timmy's dad(who also voiced Timmy's dad in the cartoon) but even that fails to help the movie in the long run


I give this "film" a 0 out of 10.

He shares no sceanes with Clift and Martin till the very last minute but, you have to remember that this story was taken from a novel by Irwin Shaw an author much in the same vein as Jackie Collins and other romanticist types. So views very much like reading a novel but just condensed down to movie format.I liked "The Young Lions" but I feel it could have been a tad better.

$review_text.: I was particularly unimpressed by this movie when I watched it in the theatre with my five-year-old son.  He enjoyed it, but fortunately many of the issues that might frustrate adults went over his head.First there was the sexual suggestiveness of the movie.  It was far too mature for young children.Second, there was the plagaristic issue.  As many have noted, this is a ridiculous animated rip-off of March of the Penguins (which was interesting and educational unlike this).Third, there was the overt racist stereotyping of many of the characters.  I don't belong to any of the ethnic groups affected, but I found the over-the-top charicatures to be mildly offensive.Fourth, It was excessively preachy.  I am used to Hollywood pretentiousness in their socio-political values, but I am getting tired of them using cartoons to brainwash my children with the whole 'humans bad' agenda.It staggers me to recall that this waste of film won an oscar over cars.  It just goes to prove that the Academy follows their own agenda, and that the entertainment value of a movie is irrelevant.

$REVIEW.: Wow...heard nothing but great reviews about this, but found it of incredibly poor quality. The music seemed inserted just to have a song, the lyrics were utterly ridiculous, and the conflicts were forced and annoying. There was some character promise in the princess, but the villain was a ridiculous caricature and the older sister really irritated me with her hypocritical overprotection of a sister she hadn't spoken to in years. The Little Mermaid, this isn't. I'll stick with animated films made by artists who still have some passion for their craft, like the people who made Despicable Me 1 & 2.

$REVIEW.: Derek Jarman's vision of The Tempest is a strange but artistic one. Although at times it can be too weird to really take seriously, Jarman's film deserves to be seen by those who love Shakespeare and those who love movies. In The Tempest, Jarman combines elements of traditional Shakespeare, Stanley Kubrick, and the Rocky Horror Picture Show to create an extraordinary vision of the classic play. Baz Luhrmann owes a lot to this movie for his adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, as evidenced by the combination of genres, the bizarre imagery, and especially Elisabeth Welch's performance as a Josephine Baker-inspired chanteuse, which mirrors Desiree's incarnation as Billie Holiday in Luhrmann's film. It is worth noting that those who were not open-minded enough to appreciate Luhrmann's film should probably not see this one.Despite all of these innovations, however, The Tempest moves too slowly to keep up with its own progressive style. The movie would have greatly benefited from being shortened by about half an hour. The one reason to sit through the tedious moments is to watch Karl Johnson, who, as a nervous Ariel, gives by far the most interesting performance.

Considering the time and technology available Orson Welles did a brillant job on William R


Hearst.I shall also acknowledge that it took a lot of guts on the part of all hands involved to go up against the old boy
But they did and made a great film.But I still find it a dated film that covers a period of history that really does not move me like the American Civil War did or some other periods of our nations history


Altogether I rather watch "Casablanca","The Day the Universe Changed" or Ken Burns "The Civil War".

$review_text.: WWE Badd Blood was a good PPV. The Hell In a Cell match between Triple H and Kevin Nash was very brutal. The two ferocious combatants tore into each other, using steel chairs, ring steps, a hammer, a sledgehammer, a screw driver, and even the infamous 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire!!! The result is a bloodbath, and Mick Foley even serves as the special guest referee.Shawn Micheals takes on Ric Flair in a matchup that I expected to be a classic. Unfortunately, it wasn't that much of a classic, but still fairly good. I like the part where Shawn frog-splashes Ric Flair through a wooden table at ringside.The match between Booker T and Christian was doing pretty good until Christian chickened out and got himself disqualified. That stinks!!!Scott Steiner takes on Test to determine who gets Stacy Keabler for manager. Test did a good job getting heat from the crowd. Steiner does his job and teaches Test a lesson. Not too bad of a match.The redneck contest between Eric Bischoff and Steve Austin is absolutely hilarious and quite interesting. Austin humiliates Eric by beating him in a burping contest, and finally throwing him in a muddy pig pen. Oh, and the "poon-tang pie scene" involving 70 year old Mae Young is outrageously funny.I would recommend this WWE video to diehard wrestling fans and Hell In a Cell buffs.

$REVIEW.: I admit I don't remember the Smurfs that much these days
 I haven't watched the cartoon in a good 25 years


 The only episode I can remember is the one where the sun would rapidly rise and set rather quickly

 What I *do* remember however, is the cartoon being much funnier than this failed attempt at a movie.This is one of the rare times when implementing animated characters in a realistic setting doesn't work for me
 In this case, the Smurfs enter a portal as a way to escape an angry wizard and find themselves in Manhattan

 While there, they stumble upon an apartment where the character of Neil Patrick Harris and his pregnant wife are staying
 The Smurfs then go on an adventure around the city (while dragging Neil Patrick and his wife along) awaiting the next blue moon so they can all return home.These Smurfs are really boring and unfunny
 Yes, I realize that being a 31-year old man, this movie isn't exactly intended for me


 However I really enjoy the Alvin & the Chipmunks movies


 These are really hilarious

 Not a single Smurf stands out to me other than the female one, and this is *only* because she's the only female of the bunch (and admittedly, kind of cute!)I don't even remember an evil wizard guy named Gargamel with an orange cat from the cartoons
 This guy and his crossed-eyed cat chases the Smurfs around the city streets


 The problem is that this little adventure isn't a particularly interesting one

 The Smurfs mess up the home of Neil Patrick Harris, create chaos at the downtown mall and get all the children excited when the kids spot the Smurfs running around (and assume they're some kind of high tech toy upon seeing their realistic movements) and near the end all the other Smurfs get together as a way to take down the bad guy but..


I never laughed once


 I never felt entertained once.The segment with the Smurfs playing Guitar Hero with Neil Patrick Harris isn't the least bit funny to me and was seriously overdone and unnecessary

 In fact I consider Neil Patrick Harris completely unsuitable for this role

 He's much nastier and raw in his comedy performance usually (well I mean, in other films- obviously How I Met Your Mother is rather tame)


 The only thing I really liked is the family's basset hound and this is only because I'm a fan of dogs (hounds and retrievers in particular).Overall, I wasn't entertained


 Bland Smurf characters, average storyline, and bad movie overall


 Skip it.

$review_text.: My parents rented this dvd, and told me it actually was pretty good (though you'd think by now I would have learned my lesson about trusting their judgement on film), so I figured I'd check it out. That was a horrible mistake. Somebody casted Jennifer Lopez as the lead role. That was a horrible mistake. I suppose I should have kept in mind that Nicholas Kazan, writer of Bicentennial Man wrote the script, both of which were horrible mistakes. Three great actors, Juliette Lewis, Dan Futterman and Bill Cobbs were in this film--a horrible mistake on their part. And while this wasn't the best movie for Noah Wylie to take a part in, he did a wonderful job. He played a villainous role, one that is so unlike what he usually plays, and he did it well. Very creepy. Not a horrible mistake to take a role, just a horrible mistake that the role was in this movie. It's predictable and the only outstanding thing about this film is that it is, you guessed it, all a horrible mistake.

I've seen almost everything he's done recently and it's been a toss-up: he's loud, he's wild, he says and does weird things
Are they funny things he does? Not often

But the ensembles he appeared with before Hangover II kept him buried far enough down in the mix that these glaring defects didn't show, while letting his weirdo-schtick persona do a few gags here and there


In this movie, his character is pushed to prominence showing a nasty-at-hearrt vein of non-humor that destroys the film before it can even begin.

$review_text.: You can almost hear Spock saying a line such as that one


There are many lines and ideas and storylines Fred Friedberger continued to rip-off from Star Trek and shove into Space:1999


There are many ridiculous concepts and explanations in this series, but Season 2 adds more reasons why the general public never caught onto the program
There also seems to be a lack of creativity in monsters and alien races


The same ludicrous and dated alien/monster appears in three consecutive stories, only slightly altered so the viewer won't be able to tell the difference

And not to improve on imperfection, the teleplays(script editing) and acting can be really embarassing at times
Though the production values still look good as with the model effects

If there was one thing Friedburger achieved for Season 2, was that the characters are little more likable

Season 1 featured too many wooden performances and not enough character interaction


Now, some of the interaction between characters in Season 2 is just unbearable at times, it can be amusing
And, this is also the best looking of the DVD releases


The extras have a certain crispness to it

But those theatrical trailers are COD-awful!Seed of Destruction: Ok, a remake of the last Star Trek serial from Season 3

Landau could've played it a little more hammier.And the ending couldn't have been more rushed.The Beta Cloud: A guilty pleasure with Anholt and Schell trying to steal the show with their acting
there are so many unanswered questions and ridiculous concepts in this one, you couldn't count them on repeated viewings

The bug-eyed robot/monster will appear re-dressed in the next 2 adventures


A Friedburger classic.A Matter of Balance: Would've been tolerable without the ludicrous concept of antimatter

Shouldn't it have been "another dimension"?Space Warp: Is only good for it's model effects
The Eagle Hangar crash scene is not to be missed


Other than that, you were warned about another Friedburger classic.The Bringers of Wonder Parts 1 & 2: The best of the lot, and one of the best of the season, but that's not saying much

There are discontinuity problems and of course ridiculous explanations

But Part 1 is great, with Landau completely overacting at the sight of the creatures


he also has some stupid lines at the beginnig: "I haven't had this much fun since I burned Grandma's wig!" and "Big daddy's coming in!! Yaaaaaa!!!!" Part 2 does let down, but there's a great Season 1 line at the end


But of course, all Season 2 serials end with a frozen laugh scene.This show may be absolutely stupid, but I still enjoy it and get a guilty pleasure from a program I grew up with...

$review_text.: THE GUILT TRIP is a film made for people who enjoy warm, poignant comedies, the kind that have lost their way amidst very funny, but very raunchy, in-your-face movies like BRIDEMAIDS
 This is not that kind of comedy at all

 The humor is gentle and there is a message!!  I enjoy both ends of the spectrum--BRIDEMAIDS is hilarious

THE GUILT TRIP is also very funny, but I am sure that most teenagers would not get a kick out of seeing Streisand and Rogen banter back and forth

So maybe this film is for the middle aged crowd? Well, so be it


 My wife and I laughed out loud with the rest of the audience and we sniffled a bit when things got rough for the two characters

Rogen's character has a lot to learn about being a son--much more than his mother does
 She can be annoying, but he can be spiteful
 I saw my mother in Streisand's Joyce (and we are not Jewish--Joyce is not a typical "Jewish" mother--that is offensive! My mother is also on a fixed income, and she uses coupons, and she calls to see how I am if I have not called her in a while)

 Joyce is a mother, a woman, whose son lives across the country, and whose husband left decades ago


 Her son needs to learn to respect his mother just because she is his mother


All sons need to learn this!  Buy this film and watch it with Mom
ENJOY!

$REVIEW.: Tom Laughlin returns as "Billy Jack" for the third time (Born Losers [1967], Billy Jack [1971]). Also returning is Laughlin's real-life wife, Delores Taylor as "Jean", Victor Izay as "Doc", Lynn Baker as "Lynn" and Susan Sosa as "Sunshine", Teresa Kelly, William Wellman Jr.We are first reminded of the shooting at Kent State in 1970 and other school massacres.  We then see Jean talking to reporters from the hospital bed. Billy Jack has been shot too.  They don't know if he will make it. Jean proceeds to tell about the horrible massacre that occurred on the reservation.On trial, Billy Jack could be arrested.  He just wanted to protect the Indians and thus he filed charges against the officers.  Jean's rape in 1971 is also discussed, but the lawyer does not believe she was actually raped.I was really disappointed in this third "Billy Jack" film.  The second film, BILLY JACK (1971), actually made you feel sorry for the Indians.  This third film is poorly-acted and over-acted.  It tries to be over-emotional.  It tries to stir up alot of issues.  They start with making statements about child abuse and later instead of making you feel something for the Indians, they actually are the trouble-makers in this film.  It is the Indians verses the police.The only scenes I found of interest were the Indian ceremony scenes when Billy Jack was hallucinating and being visited by spirits.John Navlin was the consultant for the filming of the Indian ceremonies.Note: Sacheen Littlefeather plays an attorney.

$review_text.: This is a creepy, weird, funny, sad tale of a poor girl's life. It has so many twists and turns that there is no way you will ever get bored. There are no subtitles, so it may be a bit hard to follow at times. Add to that the horrible American accents and you may feel frustrated. Keep watching! It's worth it. This is not the type of period piece you are used to. The acting is fine. The storytelling is fun. It's a great time.

$REVIEW.: Many moons ago Disney released &quot;Rob Roy&quot; starring Glennis Johns as Mary and Richard Todd as Robert Roy McGregor.  Todd was an extremely good-looking man and a real life hero who is mentioned in Stephen Ambrose's  book &quot;D-Day, the Sixth of June.&quot;  Until the current version of  &quot;Rob Roy&quot; was released I didn't think the story could be told any  better.I bought the DVD and was lucky enough to see this film on the big  screen. Although the wild scenery of Scotland which features so prominently  cannot be depicted in quite the same way on the small screen, the DVD does  it justice. Also, since I flinch at violence, I find the DVD version less  threatening--though it's just as disturbing. This is not a film for kids,  whereas the the Disney version was made for kids.Jessica Lange plays  Mary--Robert's wife.  Ms. Lange is an incredible stage (Cat on a Hot Tim  Roof) and movie actress and she was perfectly cast as Mary McGregor. Sans  make-up, this 45+ year-old-woman CAN hold a candle to any young chick. I  don't recall if she received a nomination for her acting in this film, but  she should have. Her reactions as she undergoes some horrific moments at  the hands of the vile Archie Cunningham (Tim Roth) made me want to  personally kill him.Roth is a fine actor, and at his best when he plays  sniveling despicable little rodents--though I've seen him play the leading  man credibly a time or two (Captives). He even has a nose like a rodent  (sorry Tim). He is especially good as a sniveling little rat with long  golden curls and a plumed hat. Who'd have thought he would make such a  &quot;real&quot; 18th Century dandy after playing such a punk in &quot;Pulp  Fiction.&quot; He deserved the Oscar he didn't get.I saw &quot;Rob  Roy&quot; because I love history stories, and because this film featured  the wonderful Liam Neeson as Robert Roy McGregor. Goodness Mr. Neeson looks  good in a kilt! And without a kilt. And almost any way at all--except with  Archie Cunningham at his throat with a big big knife.The dialogue is  brilliant. I must have heard my mother talking about turning sow's ears  into silk purses a dozen times, but she never used the expression quite the  way Mary McGregor does. The banter between Robert and Mary  smolders.There are some bloody and heart-breaking moments. The story  fairly accurately portrays what is known of the life of Robert Roy  McGregor, sometimes cattle rustler and local Scottish hero. Mr. McGregor  lost his lands through the nefarious dealings of an English Baron, and he  became a wanted man who was befriended by another English Baron who  employed him to &quot;watch&quot; his herds.At the time the film takes  place (late 18th century) Scotland was heavily oppressed by the English. It  had lost the freedom won in the wake of &quot;Braveheart&quot; William  Wallace's deeds.  Following the Enclosure Acts, which English Barons used  to control the land, thousands of Scots left for America as endentured  servents. The poverty of the landless Scots is dismally portrayed.  This  film makes a nice counterpoint to the &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;  which picks up the tale of the Scottish immigrants (endentured servents)in  the New World. Both of these films accurately depict the same time period  on opposite sides of the Atlantic and give the viewer a clearer  understanding of why &quot;White&quot; folks immigrated to and settled in  the New World.
$SUMMARY.: Great cast, great movie...

$REVIEW.: Absolutely LOVE this DVD.If you read my reviews, you know I am a big Ravi/Ana fan.  I have 19 DVD's counting this one.  This is my latest favorite!!I got this in the mail and just watched it first.  The sets "look" deceptively simple, but once you lay on the floor on your stomach  and kick your heels to your butt for a minute or two, you'll see what I mean...it looked simple..not.I was very perplexed by the complaints in the negative reviews.  Everything that they didn't like I liked.  I read the reviews before buying this DVD and expected terrible singing, bad music. overly sexy clothes and extremely repetitive and boring exercises...no, no, no, no and no!I so enjoyed the music and Ana's singing voice is so soothing and peaceful.  The tone is right on for the DVD.I think Ana dresses appropriately for this DVD.  I'm fact, I think she wears more clothing  in this DVD than the others, but I don't practice with my eyes open, so I don't focus on her looks.I couldn't be happier with the practice and mantras. I sometimes practice Iyengar yoga, which is a bit more static, but found that Kundalini fits my style more.  I like to dance, ride motorcycles, hike and this type of moving yoga is more my style.  If it's not your style that's fine.  It's not wrong or bad...maybe just not for you right now.  I find myself going through phases and sometimes I may "need" a vinyasa flow or a Iyengar practice...This is truly a feel good DVD...Happy Hormones is the right title...Thank you again Ravi and Ana for such a wonderful, thoughtful practice.

$REVIEW.: Dorian has a problem.  He realizes he's gay and isn't sure he wants to be.  He does have a supportive brother, so there's that.  He's discovered a counselor - a gay one that assures him he's fine.  But Dorian wants kids.  So there's church and the Bible.  That'll fix him.  Or the stripper will.Or maybe there's just reality.  The reality that he didn't have a choice.  He is who and what he is.  There's the reality that he has to tell his dad because he isn't hiding anymore.  Of course Dad is old school (this takes place in the 70s) - think Archie Bunker meets Red Foreman of That 70s Show.  Dad sees Dorian as the lesser son already.  He's not athletic like his brother.  He once dared to question his dad's political tirades.  Dorian has a poster of JFK in his room.  He's clearly a moron.  Dad is always right.  Dad knows being gay is a choice and an immoral one at that.  Dorian pretty much hated his father before he knew he even realized that he was gay.  His mother is spacey and oblivious.  But Dorian is about to head off to NYU, to the best city in the world, especially for a boy like him.  So hey, even if telling dad goes as bad as he expects it will, who cares?  The time is now.But sometimes life doesn't go how you expect it to.  Well, except for telling dad.  That is, of course, a disaster.Not really a comedy.  Not really a drama.  Much like real life, it's a tad of everything.  Having watched friends in my lifetime have to drop out of school over similar situations, feeling as though they have to move, etc this one hits a bit close to home.  It's not really a "gay story" though I can see the anti-gay folk not appreciating this movie.  It is more about being who you are, trying to find yourself, family problems, life in general.  Dorian's issues in life just happened to stem from the fact that he is gay and wanted so desperately to find acceptance from others (especially his dad).  So while yes, it hits home to those of us who love people who have gone through this and yes I realize I am sort of contradicting myself here - it is definitely a movie for people who care about gay issues but it's also totally NOT about that at the same time and if you're someone who is willing to just accept gay and straight characters both then it's really just a life story that anyone who has been a little lost could relate to.

$review_text.: This is a fantastic sequel to one of the coolest and bloodiest boldest action movies of recent years, the raid blew us away with its amazing hyper active fast paced fighting and good bloody gory carnage, the raid 2 does it again on higher level, its 150 minute running time swoops by with ease and great pace as the sequel plays out perfect with a better deeper story and much, much more amazing fighting and the bloodiest goriest action ever! The fight scenes in this are incredibly realistic and super fast, bone crunching and violent as hell, there is some incredible fights with guns, baseball bats, hammers, knives, machetes, all incredible painful and gory but beautifully done at the same time, the effects are top notch too, the fight scene towards the end of the film in the kitchen is one of the most amazing fights ever seen and is such a stand out moment in the film, there is a fantastically shot car chase action scene too which is clipped together incredibly well with great camera shots, its an amazing film overall and there's nothing bad to say, if this is your type of movie then its a total must see, easily one of the best films of the year and one of the best action movies for many years, believe the hype it raises the bar for what action in movies can be like if done by such quality filmmakers as these

$review_text.: I borrowed the DVD based on the reviews here

I think it's overrated


It had promise at the beginning but begins to fizzle out in the middle

The main character had flashbacks which is not explained why


Disabled children resistance fighters? C'mon


Let's get real
When did that happen? Evidently this is fiction


Even then I thought this would be a film similar to WWII horror comics, e.g


"Spear of Destiny, etc." because of the skeleton-faced Germans on the cover


If you really want to see a good WWII indie film you'd be better of with "When Trumpets Fade" and "Saints and Soldiers." "Combat!" television series in the 60's was way better

This was a waste of my time and money.

$REVIEW.: My kids saw this movie like three times at the theater.  They swore up and down that it was hysterically funny.  Kewel...  I never got the chance to see it, so when the DVD came out yesterday I snatched it up, of course.  Well, my children and I watched it first thing when I got home from work and I gotta say... it was not hysterically funny.  In fact, it seemed really pushed and formulaic.  I like Ben Stiller most of the time and Chris Rock and David Scwimmer was perfet for the hypochodriac giraffe, but it seemed forced.  The penguins were funny...as were the lemurs.  It just felt middle-of-the-road for me.  I usually enjoy animated movies with my kids (we own every Disney DVD) and I did enjoy this one, just not that much.  Kind of a disappointment.  See for yourself.  Maybe I was just tired, but I doubt that.  I know funny and it did garner a few chuckles from me, but this is not knock-down-drag-out funny.  (See Monty Python's Holy Grail for that or Spinal Tap or The Emperor's New Groove for that matter....)  Overall...bland.Dig it!

$REVIEW.: The storyline in Five Minutes to Heaven involves a group of Irish teens whe ride around in a car and shoot someone (in a REALLY graphic way- expect realism and lots of blood).  I never could understand why this particular person was targeted- the Irish accents by the teenagers was really strong so if they DID explain it, I couldn't understand them.This is one extremely small part of the storyline that leads to a MUCH lengthier chapter later on.  Needless to say, this portion of the film is *significantly* more interesting than the second half of the movie.*Now* the storyline is set 33 years later when everybody is an adult, and now the story shifts into an *extremely* long build-up between the murderer (the gunman himself) and the younger brother of the murdered man (who was just a kid at the time, outside playing kick ball when the whole shooting incident occurred).  The two finally get to meet each other 33 years later.The problem?  *The entire movie* is about the build-up between the two men.  You see, they're BOTH inside the same castle but they're both in separate rooms.  They both struggle to come to terms with what happened that dreaded night over 30 years ago.  So they stay inside their castle rooms and contemplate how to handle the situation.  They pace back and forth wondering how they'll conduct themselves when they finally meet.  It lasts an *eternity* and it eventually reaches a point of boredom.However, I did like the film because it *did* feel like it was going somewhere for a while- the movie writers just stretched out this particular scene for WAY too long.  Also, I thought it was rather strange that the mother blamed the younger brother for her sons death.  Are you kidding me?  Blaming a kid who wouldn't have been able to do anything about it anyway since not only did he not have a gun, but he'd be forced to defend himself against FOUR teenagers much older than he was?  Give me a break, mom!

$REVIEW.: "U.F.O." was a short-lived sci-fi TV series created by Gerry & Sylvia Anderson. The premise of the show was simple: following the discovery that an extraterrestrial civilization has been paying clandestine visits to Earth to kidnap & kill humans to harvest their body parts, the United Nations funds a highly secretive international organization nicknamed SHADO (Supreme Headquarters Alien Defense Organization) to combat the alien threat.  SHADO's commander, Colonel Ed Straker (Ed Bishop) is assisted by Col. Alec Freeman (George Sewell), Col. Paul Foster (Michael Billington) and Col. Virgina Lake (Wanda Ventham).SHADO utilizes various resources to combat the aliens:1. A sophisticated, underground headquarters pretending to be a major film studio in London.2. A manned lunar base (Moonbase) armed with three fighters (Interceptors) to attack UFOs before they reach Earth, and usually commanded by Lt. Gay Ellis (Gabrielle Drake) or Lt. Nina Barry (Dolores Mantez).3. A sophisticated control & radar tracking satellite called SID (Space Intruder Detector) orbiting the Earth to detect incoming UFOs.4. A fleet of submarine fighter carriers (Skydivers) called upon to attack UFOs in Earth's atmosphere should the Moonbase Interceptors fail to destroy UFOs in space. Each Skydiver is capable of launching a single fighter called Sky One (or using some other numbered designation).5. A fleet of sophisticated armored personnel carriers (Mobiles) to seek out and destroy UFOs that land.6. Other support craft including moon rovers and the Lunar Module (used to shuttle personnel between the Earth & moon).Recurring themes in the 26 total episodes include:1. SHADO's continual attempts to avert the alien's plans & attacks.2. The aliens' various attempts to destroy SHADO, Straker or both.3. The effect that being a SHADO operative has on personal lives (usually Straker's or Foster's life).4. SHADO's attempts to obtain more information about the aliens.5. Security threats to SHADO's secrecy.6. Ongoing funding issues for SHADO's very costly expenses.With the infamous purple wigs that female Moonbase personnel wear, hippies, exuberant usage of bright colors and go-go boots, "U.F.O." has the look and feel of the late 1960's, especially since when it was filmed between 1969 and 1970.  However, none of that takes away from the quality of the writing.  Dialog wasn't always great, but plot consistency and the revisiting of previous storylines made for a very engaging and character-driven series. In comparison with the Anderson's later TV series "Space 1999", "U.F.O." was far more consistent and interesting. "Space 1999", which was originally set to be another season of "U.F.O.", never achieved the same level of character development or consistency, though its special effects were improved.I rate the 13 episodes contained in this 4-DVD set as follows:* "The Responsibility Seat" 5+/5.  A beautiful reporter interviews Straker and leaves her purse with a running tape recorder in Straker's office.  With Straker busy, Freeman is in charge of SHADO and contends with multiple issues including a runaway Russian moon mobile on a colision course with Moonbase.* "E.S.P." 4.5/5.  A man, John Cruxley (John Stratton), is going mad because he can read other people's thoughts and foresees his wife killed when a UFO crashes into their house.  What threat does Cruxley pose to SHADO?* "Kill Straker!" 4.5/5. A UFO takes over the minds of Foster and another pilot on the moon with a single purpose: to kill Straker.  Will they succeed?  Will Straker keep confidence in Foster?* "Sub Smash" 4/5.  Straker and Nina Barry go on board Skydiver to hunt down a rogue UFO, but it disables Skydiver, forcing Straker to contend with claustrophobia.  Will they get out alive?* "The Sound of Silence" 4.5/5.  Avoiding interception, a UFO lands near the home of champion horse trainers.  After one person disappears, will Foster be able to find and destroy the UFO, and what will be found inside of an alien-made cylinder?* "The Cat With Ten Lives" 4/5.  When on leave, SHADO Interceptor pilot James Regan (Alexis Kanner) and his wife are ambushed by a UFO after stopping their car to avoid hitting a cat.  Regan's wife disappears, but Regan keeps the cat, which is under alien control.* "Destruction" 5/5.  After a naval ship destroys a UFO, SHADO and the Navy argue over each other's secrecy; but has someone's security been undermined by the aliens?* "The Man Who Came Back" 4/5.  Weeks after SID is disabled by a UFO attack and a spaceship disappears, the pilot of the missing spaceship mysteriously reappears.  Can the reappeared pilot repair SID or does he have other intentions?* "The Psychobombs" 5+/5.  A landed UFO hypnotically controls 3 nearby people and gives them seemingly superhuman strength.  Can SHADO stop them before they destroy SHADO?* "Reflections in the Water" 4/5. A large underwater dome is found by Skydiver.  What will Foster and Straker find inside?* "Timelash" 5++/5.  Straker and Lake are trapped within a moment of time.  Will they be able to stop a UFO from attacking SHADO headquarters that gained assistance from a crazed SHADO traitor?* "Mindbender" 5/5.  After a UFO mysteriously self-destructs near Moonbase, a few SHADO operatives begin to hallucinate with deadly results, including Straker.* "The Long Sleep" 5+/5.  A comatose woman awakens after 10 years to waiting SHADO personnel.  She saw a UFO and two aliens plotting something. Can she remember where she dropped a critical alien component?People more accustomed to modern computerized special effects may not enjoy "U.F.O." as much because its special effects aren't as expensive or sophisticated; but don't let lack of funds or lack of technology spoil your enjoyment of this underrated TV series that I rate with 5 out of 5 stars!

$review_text.: Halloween, Halloween II and Halloween III got very good treatment for Blu-ray. Halloween 4 is probably considered the second or third-best sequel but the extras are average on this release. The old DVD making of documentary is missing in addition to one of the commentaries. We get about 18 minutes of bonus content along with 2 audio commentaries. Hopefully Return will celebrate the legacy of Mike Myers with a deluxe 2-disc Blu-ray release in the near future. The picture and audio quality are average.Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 | Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1Audio Formats: English Dolby TrueHD 5.1Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, SpanishSpecial Features: * Audio Commentary with Director Dwight H.

$REVIEW.: It might surprise many people to find that many of our most revered adventure films hearken back to the era of the pulps for inspiration; the most glaring (and possibly best) example of that of course being the INDIANA JONES films. But there's also some brand-recognition that's at work at times to, more specifically with the recent (and amazingly awful) reboot of CONAN THE BARBARIAN. When director Andrew Stanton, director of two of the most beloved films in recent years (the beautiful FINDING NEMO and the Kubrick-with-a-heart genius of WALL-E, which I consider to be the best animated film ever made), decided to make his first jump into live-action films, he also looked back to the pulps. In this instance, he looked to the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan, and less-famously, the tale of a Confederate Civil War soldier thrust onto the Red Planet as originally told in the book "The Princess of Mars". While the film itself surrounds the adventures of the titular character, the real star of JOHN CARTER is Stanton and the deftness and joy that he tells this tale which, aside from a few missteps and some less-than-stellar characterization, is a rousing pulp sci-fi adventure extravaganza with some of the most eye-poppingly amazing visuals of a film since AVATAR.This film has a cast that is to die for... aside from its star. You have Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris (The princess of the tale whose only other real claim to film is X-MEN ORIGINS: WOVERINE as Silverfox) who plays her as an intelligent, quirky, beautiful and deadly woman; Ciaran Hinds, James Purefoy and the voice of Polly Walker who all are there to bring the same charm or gravity that they brought to their respective characters in HBO's brilliant series ROME; Dominic West (best known from THE WIRE) as Sab Than, the would-be puppet tyrant of Barsoom; Mark Strong (the British heavy in just about every film from SHERLOCK HOLMES to GREEN LANTERN) as Matai Shang, the immortal who looks to control the fate of Barsoom; Bryan Cranston in an unrecognizable but important role; and the voice talents of Willem Dafoe (who also worked with Stanton on FINDING NEMO) as Tars Tarkas, Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) as Sola, and Thomas Haden Church as Tal Hajus.Taylor Kitsch as Carter lacks a certain consistency in his characterization. He has charm and is ruggedly handsome, but he lacks the leading-man charisma a role like this requires. The writing by Stanton, Michael Chabon, and Mark Andrews, who have a number of characters to deal with, a great deal of plot and exposition and to combine all of this with some bravura action set-pieces hurts the film somewhat in terms of characterization and may seem like a waste of talent in some cases, but each actor has their moment to shine, no matter the size of the part. The real winner, cast-wise, is Collins, who is so strong in her performance that I want to see her in more roles, and would love to see a film based just around her character. But the film is strong enough on its other merits to maintain great interest in the characters and the story to see it all the way through and still have a terrific time.The biggest winner here is sadly the biggest loser of everyone involved here, and that is Andrew Stanton. He directs the film with an eye for spectacle, precision of detail, and most appropriately, a strong sense of fun; the best example of this is the scene in which Carter leaps from ship to ship eventually meeting and fighting alongside Dejah. It's an incredible moment in the film because of just how well each moment is orchestrated. He tells the story of the film with a visual assuredness that rivals that of more experienced live-action filmmakers, and the filmmakers assembled a fantasic crew of digital and practical effects artists so that the interaction between the human/humanoid actors and the CG characters is totally seamless. Unfortunately, the film was something of a colossal bust at the box office due to exceedingly luke-warm reviews, an epically poor marketing campaign, and the natural comparisons between this film and AVATAR. I would watch this film a hundred more times before I would ever even think of watching AVATAR again, but it's a comparison worth making. So because of all this, the "failure" of this film to reach the heights it was intended to hit is all on Stanton's shoulders, which may hurt his ability to continue making live-action films. Although, looking at the reviews on Amazon, this film might receive some new life on home video, and the disconnect that exists between the marketing of the film and getting audiences in the theaters may now start to dissipate via word of mouth.When all is said and done, JOHN CARTER is a exciting pulp-flavored visual feast with something for everyone, and I can only hope that everyone can watch it and enjoy it as much as I did.4/5 Stars.
$SUMMARY.: The real star of JOHN CARTER is Andrew Stanton.

$review_text.: SPOILERS FOLLOWI like "Supergirl."  Starring Helen Slater, Faye Dunaway, Brenda Vaccaro, Peter Cook, and Peter O'Toole, it's actually a fairly entertaining movie.  Some of its most glaring shortcomings are some of the most obvious strengths of the early Christopher Reeve "Superman" movies(of which this is an indirect 1984 spinoff), but this movie is also able to stand on its own.Opening on Argo City, the movie does a decent job of establishing a distinct look for a contained, peaceful world.  Helen Slater is a good Kara Zor-El.  The chemistry between Ms. Slater and Peter O'Toole powers the early scenes and sets up a vaguely interesting plot point.  Mr. O'Toole plays Zaltar, a scientist and philosopher who is the custodian of the Omegahedron, a pulsating source of power for the planet.  Even as a kid I knew that(SPOILER) the Omegahedron gets blown to Earth and Kara leaves to bring it back.  I cannot help but compare this movie, in some respects, to the original "Superman" film.  It actually begged comparison initially by usinng the famous John Williams "Superman" theme in U.S. movie trailers.  This movie uses its own theme, a serviceable would-be epic from composer Jerry Goldsmith.  Character differentiation between Kara and Supergirl is almost nonexistent, since the movie rushes to Supergirl and the audience is robbed of a satisfactory origin story we get in most comic book adaptations. Despite this, Helen Slater's performance itself stays consistently solid throughout the picture.  The movie has a strong villainess in Faye Dunaway's witch Selena.Some storytelling cheapness blows the high-minded theme of saving a world down a notch.  The screenplay spends too much time on a romantic rivalry between Supergirl and Selena over a blue-collar worker named Ethan, played by Hart Bochner.  I'm not necessarily saying the filmmakers needed to completely omit the idea, but more screentime for Peter Cook or Peter O'Toole would not have hurt the movie."Supergirl" also marks the first time the audience sees the inside of the Phantom Zone, a hellish land of exile previously only visualized as a floating mirror in the first and second "Superman" movies. Essentially a vast and dangerous black desert, the Phantom Zone sequence in this movie remains a durable high point.I cannot give this movie an extremely low rating, frankly in part because the "Superman" movies it spun off from set such a high standard it would be arguably impossible to expect greatness from this film.  This is still a very good movie, and deserves appreciation on its own merits.

$review_text.: Ben Stiller stars as Greg Focker, a male nurse who wants to pop the question to his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo), but he discovers that he has to get the approval of Pam's father, Jack (Robert De Niro). It's perfect when Pam and Greg go to spend the weekend at her folks' house- he'll be able to ask her father. It's not that easy. Jack Byrnes is a crazed, ex-CIA agent, who doesn't like his daughter's beau the minute he meets him. It doesn't make matters any better when Greg accidentally knocks over and breaks the urn that holds the ashes of Jack's late mother with a wine cork at dinner. Greg realizes he has to win over Mr. Byrnes, so he tries desperately to impress him, but it seems everything he does turns into one, hilarious mishap after the other, like setting Pam's sister's wedding altar on fire with his cigarette and losing Jack's beloved cat, the toilet trained, Mr. Jinx.The must see Meet the Parents is an absolutely hysterical comedy and I can't wait for the sequel, Meet the Fockers to be released in 2004!

$review_text.: Mahler is the only Ken Russel film I have ever seen, and from what I read from the other reviews, it's a good movie to start with

The movie begins with a dream (which you don't find out until later)


If you want my  opinion, it's not a very good way to start a movie- for those &quot;mild  stomached&quot; people it's most likely to provoke them to turn off the TV  as soon as the scene comes on


The movie gets a bit milder after that
 Gustav Mahler (if you don't know your history) is an Austrian composer, and  in the movie it's basically focusing on his life and his bumpy relationship  with this wife


The whole movie takes place on a train
Some his flashbacks  include his rejection of Judaism for Catholism (he did it for his career),  the death of his children, and some conflicts with his wife
 I had to  watch the film a few times to get the hang of it, but if you like  independent films and like to watch movies out of the box, then this is the  movie for you.

The truth, the humanity of the series touched me and helped heal me.  We all want this series on DVD with any special material that would be available.I, like most of us guys, was in love with Dana (McMurphy).  The girl next door, who had that hard edge but was our saving grace while in the hospital and they stayed in our dreams.  I doubt there were many guys my age who didn't want to just hold McMurphy and comfort her at her times of crisis.KC was our 'hottie' and it is wonderful to see Marg on CSI as a bright intellegent lady.I have all the episodes on tape, but like most tape some are good and some are bad.  I eagerly await on its release.  I will be one of the first in line to buy it.

$REVIEW.: Although 'Night of the Grizzly' was released by Paramount, it's easy to mistake it as a Disney film! Long on family values and gentle humor, this adventure yarn is the kind of 'live-action' feature that the studio specialized in throughout the fifties


If you don't think a film that kids can enjoy will be your 'cup of tea', you might be in for a surprise! This is a terrific movie!Ex-Marshal Jim Cole (played with rugged charm by 'Cheyenne' Clint Walker) moves his family onto a small ranch, hoping to get away from the dangers of his previous line of work


His loving wife, Angela (popular '60s star Martha Hyer) is overjoyed by their new life, and the kids soon develop a bond with the beautiful countryside, and the small town nearby.Not EVERYONE is happy about the arrangement, however; town bigshot Jed Curry (Keenan Wynn) wants Cole's land, and his sons are soon attempting to provoke Cole, in an unsuccessful attempt to force him to leave

When a montrous killer grizzly appears, and starts killing off Cole's livestock, Curry sees his opportunity; as the primary shareholder at the bank, he makes it nearly impossible for the rancher to get loans to replace stock.The grizzly, nicknamed 'Satan', terrorizes the countryside, killing men, horses, and farm animals, and Cole methodically begins hunting it, in hopes of getting the $750 bounty that would 'save' his ranch!The arrival of bounty hunter Cass Dowdy (played with cold-blooded menace by Leo Gordon, a veteran screen villain) further muddies the waters; Cole had once arrested him, and Dowdy spent two years in the 'pen', vowing revenge! Adored by the eldest Cole child, Charlie (Kevin Brodie), Dowdy announces he will kill the grizzly and accept the bounty, simply to ruin Cole! The pieces are now in place for a thrilling finale, as Cole, Charlie, and Dowdy confront the enraged beast, in a scene eerily similar to the climax of 'Jaws'!The film offers a supporting cast of Hollywood 'pros', including Jack Elam ('Cannonball Run'), as bizzare but sweet Hank, who is 'adopted' by Cole's young daughter, Gypsy (the wonderful Victoria Paige Meyerink, in her second film); Nancy Kulp (TV's 'The Beverly Hillbillies') as the spinster owner of the local mercantile store; Ron Ely (TV's first 'Tarzan') and Sammy Jackson (TV's 'No Time for Sergeants') as Dowdy's sons; and Regis Toomey ('Burke's Law'), as the sympathetic banker.This is a film to cherish, and enjoy, again and again! Gather the family...They'll thank you for it!

$REVIEW.: This movie pays great homage to the old drive in flicks. Like when Grindhouse was released with "Death Proof" and "Planet Terror" those movies were intended to have the grimy effect, like the original Grindhouse movies. The over the top bad effects and melodramatic acting is all intended as that is what drive ins produced.  Personally, I think the movie was brilliant as it recapped on styles originated by Hershel Gordon Lewis, John Waters, Ed Wood etc. This is not supposed to be taken seriously by any means but is intended to the viewer, movie buff, to be a homage to some of the most tasteless movies ever made.  Also, let me note that for those who aren't movie buffs in the 50s - 70s , it almost seemed that you were with the in crowd if  you did a tasteless movie, example, "Pink Flamingos" "Attack of The Killer Tomatoes" "Blood Feast" so on and so fourth.  None of these movies had a big budget or academy award winning actors but they have stood the test of time because they are so awful they are good.  Besides the success of how awful but good "Troll 2" is, this is perhaps my favorite worst modern movie.For those interested in seeing this after the rant,  you will see melodramatic performances that are intended to be bad, effects that are intended to look cheap, and toilet humor.  Viewers will be introduced to four stories 1. Wadzilla (a giant sperm) 2. I Was a Teenage Wearbear (a homage piece to beach musical movies with a teenage werewolf feel but it gay oriented so it becomes wearbear.) 3. The Diary of Anne Frankenstein (which is homage to the movies where you had a famous name meet with a monster, example Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein, however the dialog isn't as nice as those old movies) 4. Zom-b-Movie (is a recap on zombie flicks and sleaze, it reminded me of a SNL spoof I saw a long time ago titled, "Attack of the Masturbating Zombies".)In conclusion, this movie isn't for everyone, to start with you have to admire bad taste and if you haven't found the art that bad taste has to offer, start with the master directors I listed above such as John Waters. After watching the classics, I think most haters will enjoy this piece more.  Good work guys on writing and directing this! I watched this before I went into hernia surgery, I was pretty stressed about things going into this procedure and Chillerama entertained me to the point that I was able to relax and forget about the external world for a bit.

$REVIEW.: Audrey Tautou is again fabulous onscreen as the tough as nails independent Coco Chanel. the movie follows her life right up to the point where she decides to actually become a fashion designer.The sets look terrific and the acting throughout is superb. The ridiculous addition of a fictitious character who plays Coco's sister (in the extars you learn she's an amalgam of Coco's aunt and one of her sisters) to show Coco's gentle side was just plain silly. Given how dramatic Coco's life was it just seems as if the screenwriter and director fell back on some Hollywood tradition of thinking the actual true story of famous people's lives are not enough. The funny thing is this comes out of France of all places.The extras feature lengthy interviews with the cast and crew. The version I had were the hearing impaired ones that had the various stage movements (i.e., [door closes], [footsteps heard], etc.) along with the subtitles.

$review_text.: Beautiful, passionate rites of passage film


Ann Turner, the director, chose her actors well

Charlotte Rampling's cool femininity and Russell Crowe's intense masculinity created a special chemistry on screen
Ann Turner had some very delicate scenes to direct and used an subtle and artful touch

The opening scene was glorious and a joy to see an actor (or anyone) so comfortable in their own skin.The young boy who played Alan Marshall (Alexander Outhred) was  absolutely wonderful


There was a magical, childlike wonder and  innocence about the love scene between East &amp; Grace that Alan witnesses and another reason why this film is so good


The whole cast was exceptional

I don't want to spoil this for anyone
 I'll just say this could become one of my favorite films.

$review_text.: I watched THE DEADLY ASSASSIN as a child... and didn't like the whole "Matrix" setting even then, though I would have been hard pressed to say why back then.  30 odd years later, I can now say why I didn't then and still now - it is just too "human".Here we have two aliens, Time Lords no less, locked in mental combat... and we are barraged with samurai, clowns, WW I scenes, toy trains, a bi-plane, a hunting rifle.  And so on.  Robert Holmes is an undisputed legend as a Dr. Who Script Editor and Script Writer, yet Producer Philip Hinchcliffe candidly says the Holmes simply "put in his favorite bits from childhood movies."  No wonder there is a bizzare sense of displacement.  The bulk of THE DEADLY ASSASSIN, the two episode spanning "Matrix", was merely a showcase for "neat effects" instead of moving the story along.  Then there is all the other "too human" aspects that dot the script, which the viewer will quickly pick up, until we finally get to the last episode,  a refreshing sense of "Okay, so we ARE at the heart of an alien society. "But, heh, having said all that, it is still a fun episode with tongue-in-cheek sardonic humor Holmes was (in)famous for, and if it wasn't for the sheer interruption of the lengthy showdown in the neural net, would possibly have been a supremely taught solo performance in a political Time Lord thriller for Tom Baker.  Honestly, this last time I watched THE DEADLY ASSASSIN, I fast forwarded through all the "Matrix" bits... the one and only Dr. Who story of eleven doctors and all their adventures that gets this particular dishonor.Although overall a fun story that establish fundamental Time Lord lore that persists to even today's new adventures,  this serial not one of the best of early Dr. Who.  However, the Audio Commentary IS one of the better ones, very lively, interesting, and witty.

$REVIEW.: (Written by my wife before she got her own Amazon account.)This movie is good only for its depiction of the midieval period. However, as an adaptation of a classic novel, it is absolutely terrible and utterly disappointing. I loved the BBC's Pride and Prejudice, but what they did to Ivanhoe was a massacre. The plot was changed in so many, UNJUSTIFIABLE ways that they completely took the spirit of the book away. They added a little too much murderous intrigue and too much physical romance between Rebecca and Ivanhoe. That, and while I liked Susan Lynch for her acting, she really didn't look the part of the drop-dead gorgeous Jewess she was supposed to be. (Rowena, however, was pleasantly much prettier than the cover pictures show her to be.)Overall, the book was an awesome story and needed very little alterations. The BBC took a dependable title and made their own story up, destroying the real Ivanhoe and everything in it. I was disappointed over and over again as I wasted six hours of my life on this movie, and I was relieved when the movie was over.

$REVIEW.: This is the story of a 16-year-old boy 1,000 years ago who finds himself fighting alone against the killers of his mother, father and little sister. It's part epic legend on a small scale and part coming-of-age. Whatever you choose to call it, Pathfinder is an exciting and moving tale. The story is set in the northern-most reaches of what is now Scandinavia amongst the nomadic family groups of the Sami, who hunt and herd reindeer. The landscape is beautiful, but harsh and frigid. Aigin returns one day from a hunting trip to see the corpses of his parents and little sister being dumped in a frozen lake through a hole in the ice. They have been killed by the Tchudes, outlaws who prey on the Sami. Aigin is spotted but manages to escape with an arrow in his shoulder to a small family group several miles away. They treat his wound but immediately prepare to flee to the coast. They know the Tchudes are most likely tracking Aigin. The boy refuses to leave. He plans to stay and fight. "What would you do?" Aigin is asked. "Find them. Before they find us," Aigin says. "Find them," one man says. "We're not warriors!" "If they find us," Aigin says, "you know what will happen. We will have to fight. No one will be spared. Not even the children." And he's right. The Tchudes are outcasts, hard, experienced men who take what they want and slaughter everyone they catch. Three of the men decide to stay with him. There is a fight in the snow, with arrows against crossbows and axes. Aigin is captured. He may be brave, but he also is frightened. To save one of the men who has been his friend, he says he will be a pathfinder. He will show them through the icy passes in the mountains to the large encampment on the coast. His friend, of course, is slaughtered as soon as Aigin is out of sight.From here we switch back and forth between the encampment, largely made up of women and children as the men have left for hunting, and the journey through the frigid, snow-swept passes. This 16-year-old boy is up against two dozen killers, led by an utterly ruthless and shrewd leader. Aigin is no match for any of them if it comes to a fight. All Aigin has is his wits and, as we come to realize, a determination to protect the encampment by destroying the Tchudes even if it means sacrificing his own life. This is played out against the feelings of some in the settlement that Aigin is bad luck, that he led the Tchudes to them earlier and may very well be leading them to the coast where they are now. The conclusion is brutal, redeeming and satisfying.Pathfinder works so well, I think, because the story, which is a simple one, is treated in a straightforward, matter-of-fact manner. The emotions and motivations are simple and strong. The acting is plain and effective. Mikkel Gaup, the 19-year-old son of the film's director and writer, Nils Gaup, is a good-looking kid with blue eyes who comes across as exactly who he is playing, a capable young man who is brave and scared and determined. The feelings that start to show between Aigin and the young woman who treated his arrow wound are tentative and very low-key, and they're all the more touching because of that. This is a strong, affecting story with a little myth and legend-making woven in.
$SUMMARY.: A frigid, rousing adventure, as well as a touching film about courage and sacrifice

$REVIEW.: Ian Richardson is close to the perfect Sherlock Holmes, but I discovered him first portraying Doyle's inspiration for Holmes, Dr. Bell, and then learned of his two theatrical roles as Holmes in THE SIGN OF FOUR, and the subsequent HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES.Richardson's portrayal of this often filmed Holmes story is, at worst, better then most of those I've seen, and the slight changes in script from the standard FOUR efforts make it refreshing.  Richardson as Holmes was an outstanding choice and I hope to see him again in the rolls of both Holmes (white haired or not) and Dr. Bell, mentor to the youthful doctor Arthur Doyle!Get this Sign of Four while you can . . . it seems to disappear too often; and while you're doing so, pick up his version of Hound and both Bell offerings; you won't be disappointed.

 Maybe this movie was intended to be for non-enthusiasts who are not familiar with Jackie Robinson and his journey

 I appreciated that the writers didn't really take sides

$REVIEW.: This is a great look at the everday lives of your average blue- collar musician who doesn't expect fame and fortune, but is just trying to get by and play music because that is what they enjoy doing more than anything else in life
I don't understand the people who say michael J
Fox was miscast


I think he comes off as convincing in the character he portrays- and he is a real- life musician as well, even before he became famous for acting
Do people on here not realize that he did play his guitar parts for the movie and that the Barbusters were  a REAL band who played live to get into character for this movie? I recommend people try to tarck down the lIght Of Day soundtrack and hear Fox's rendition of "Rude Mood" as well as his signature song for the movie  "Ain't Got No Place To Go"
Anyway, I think the music here was fantastic throughout, and comes off very realistically


When they are playing live in the film they are actually LIVE and not using pre-recorded studio tracks to give the concert illusion

And as characters in the film move throughout the concert scenes you can hear the music ebb, flow, and wane as it would in an actual concert setting


I especially appreciate the scene during the performance of  "It's All Comin' Down Tonight" where they show a group of people exit thier cars in the parking lot and enter the club


The music is muffled and you can sense the cuncussion effect against the club walls as they approach the front doors, and then as the doors open- wow! full on rockin' out! The attention to fine details like this that any music- loving concert veteran will be all too aware of is what seperates this film from alot of music- oriented films

 Lastly, the dynamic between Patty and Joe was very well done

It's a very realistic scenario among two siblings in the same band with different aspiriations and different ideals


Look at most bands around who have siblings and take notice of how often that scenario leads to conflict and band turmoil
Light Of Day was a great, realistic portrayal of a work class bar band, and it stands apart from so many others of the genre
It needs to be released on DVD soon (with lots of interviews and extras).

$REVIEW.: I knew this movie was going to be vulgar & sexually explicit, (not to mention the drug use in scenes). But I did not realize how bad it was going to be.  I watched it because I was curious about the character & what he did.  He was so much more that a thief, but a glutton in so many ways: sex, drugs & money.  The scenes could have been shortened without losing any impact on the story.  Three hours is just too long, especially for this story.  I am sorry I rented it, soley for putting more money in Jordan Belfort's pockets.

$REVIEW.: The most successful black comedy since 1990's "The War of The Roses", "Horrible Bosses" is simply one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The plot deals with three best friends who share one element in common: they all have the boss from hell. The trio decide they have had enough and attempt a plot to kill their nasty employers by hiring a hitman.What makes the movie work is the hilarious script and the wonderful acting of the leads and the excellent supporting cast. Jason Bateman is great to look at (as always), Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell (I actually didn't recognize him), and Jamie Fox give memorable performances, but for me the gem in this movie is the beautiful Jennifer Aniston. She plays a dentist who is nothing short of a sex maniac and is determined to bed her male dental assistant. Jennifer's portrayal borders on a combination of Joan Crawford/Bette Davis/Annie Wilkes/ and Alexis Carrington all rolled into one. Picture the biggest bitch you have ever seen portrayed in movies or television, multiply it by ten and you have this character. Aniston actually dyed her hair black for the role and the language that comes out of her mouth is similar to a sailor's who has been at sea for a year. Absolutely hilarious!"Horrible Bosses" was a certified hit making over $200,000,000 at the box office and there is talk there will be a sequel.
$SUMMARY.: "Love, Love, Love This Movie!!!"

Horrible picture quality (reminds me of a reel-to-reel projector) and only slightly better sound.  It's a shame too.  I remember this little gem of a musical from my childhood.  I was about 6 years old when it came out.  For me, Fiona Fullerton became the definative &quot;Alice&quot;.  She really is wonderful...with that lilting little voice.  In fact, the entire cast stands out.  I love every minute of it.  I hope this gets re-re-released someday with total restoration in widescreen and dolby-whatever!  I'll buy it again.  In the meantime I'll watch this version regardless of how crappy it's presentation.  I do think I will avoid any DVDs by Platinum Disc Corp.  Do I smell somebody looking to make a quick buck?  At least I expect the picture quality to be better than a bad EP VHS recording!  I'd be interested in knowing if the quality of the VHS is better.  Anybody?Anyway, DVD gets 1.5 stars...the movie itself is 4.5 stars (if you didn't grow up with this sort of thing then avoid this movie at all costs.  For me, &quot;Alice&quot; is up there with Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka and The Chocolote Factory).  By the way, children should love the manic pace.  It's a blast!Another note:  watching this I was reminded of the shows I used to watch at the time.  Sid and Marty Krofft (Pufnstuf) and so forth must have been inspired by this...or the other way around.

$review_text.: Show People is one of the last great films from the silent era; and I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen
WE get great action, drama, romance and comedy even in some places where I didn't expect there to be a funny line or two

The cinematography is excellent and the choreography reflects great forethought

The plot moves along at a very good pace; I wasn't ever bored and the on screen romance between Marion Davies and William Haines worked very well despite the fact that they weren't in love at all in real life! The casting was also very well done and the banquet luncheon scene with so many stars of the day is terrific


The quality of the print could have been a little better in a few spots but this is not a huge concern.When the action starts, we quickly meet Colonel Pepper (Dell Henderson) and his daughter Peggy (Marion Davies) who have traveled by car from Georgia so that the Colonel can put his daughter Peggy in the movies

At first they don't exactly get very far, but it's not too long before they bump into Billy Boone (William Haines), a relatively small time actor who makes slapstick films while enjoying his work


Billy thinks he can help Peggy get into movies; and he's right--until, that is, Peggy realizes that she'll only be doing slapstick instead of "art" on the dramatic screen.With time Peggy gets noticed by Charlie Chaplin (who has a brief cameo as himself in this film) and after that she gets a request to show up at High Art Studios where she is signed to a lucrative contract
Trouble is, they won't take Billy and Billy must part with Peggy even though by now they are true sweethearts
Peggy also meets the fake "Count" Andre (Paul Ralli); and Andre is not such a great influence on Peggy in certain ways.Of course, from here the plot can go just about anywhere

Just what happens between Andre and Peggy; and what if Billy decides to pursue Peggy despite Andre being a part of her new life at High Art Studios? Will Peggy's father be satisfied with the way her career is going--and what happens to Peggy herself as time passes? No spoilers--watch and find out!Show People is one of the best silent films I've ever seen and probably ever will see


I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in silent film (if they haven't seen this already) and of course fans of Marion Davies and other actors in this film will be delighted with it.

$REVIEW.: I don't know where to begin


This movie is brought to us by none other than "Jake" from the movie "Fresh"

You may remember him as the guy who kept screaming "I'ma dead him deader than dead!" I guess this movie is funny in that it is so awful
It's like watching "Cabin Boy", only it's meant to be serious (I think?)


Ok, so you've got a band of outlaw cowgirls or whatever who apparently used to rob banks

The group consists of actress Marie Matiko (don't hurt yourself, I'd never heard of her either), LisaRaye and "Ebony" from "Player's Club", a Lil' Kim who keeps blowing on her guns (do I really need to make a joke about this?), and somehow Stacy Dash was even duped into being in this movie


Also in the movie, there's Bobby Brown with an eye patch...actually there are quite a few people throughout this movie with eye patches, I'm not sure what the deal is with that but you could have a drinking game while watching this movie and drink every time you see an eye patch

Then there is Macy Gray..


I don't get her part at all
Oh yeah, there is also a brief cameo from Mario Van Peebles that makes no sense whatsoever

The dialog is atrocious, the outlaw chicks look like they are shooting a video for a Nelly remake of Kool Moe Dee's "Wild, Wild West"

The plot, if you can call it that, is just flat out stupid
Still, I could not take my eyes off this movie


It's like watching a train wreck or Jerry Springer - there's this morbid curiosity to see just how bad it can get.I recommend watching it only if you and a friend are bored and want something to laugh at and make jokes about later.

$review_text.: I remember seeing TV spots for this movie in Florida in 1989 and thinking that it made for a great concept. When I eventually rented the VHS tape a few months later it really appealed to my dark sense of humor and I ended up watching it a zillion times. In the 25 years since its release it has become very dated. It's not dated BADLY, but it has aged more than other films of the period.Corporate slackers Richard and Larry (Ted Mosby prototype Jonathan Silverman and 80s person Andrew McCarthy) discover a $4,000,000 fraud hidden away in the cooked books. Their attempt to impress their boss Bernie Lomax (a lovably smug Terry Kiser) with their find leads to an invitation to his Hampton Island home for a summer weekend of babes, booze, and boats. The duo don't realize that they've stumbled on Bernie's embezzlement scam and that he intends to have them quietly killed by the Mob (the organized crime connections are never fully detailed or understood). Mob Boss Vito instead arranges for Bernie to be killed, thus washing his hands of him.Upon arriving at Bernie's lavish home Richard and Larry discover that he ain't quite breathing and most definitely has ceased living. For a variety of reasons they plot to create the illusion that Bernie is still alive, which proves to be easier done than said as his vacuous, drunken neighbors are more interested in drinking his champagne and mooching parties from him than actually being friends.Despite the dark subject matter Weekend at Bernie's plays it safe for the most part, never pushing past its PG-13 boundaries. The physicality of Kiser's performance is impressive as well as funny. You really do believe he is dead and he's brilliant at keeping a straight face (or a smirking one as he dies during a brief moment of pleasure) while being tossed and thrown around. You wouldn't think that playing a dead body would be hard but Kiser's comic timing and skill really pay off.The production design and flat photography are what date this film so much. Although Ted Kotcheff had Wake in Fright and First Blood on his resume by this point he brings very little visual flair to the film and it looks very TV-ish. The poor score by Andy Summers never seems to work with any scene (I have a feeling that his friend Stewart Copeland would have done a better job) and some of the soundtrack choices grate on the ears.What amazes me the most is that about 90% of the dialogue is (bad) ADR. I assume that the sound guy forgot to switch on the mic or something. I can accept it when it comes to dubbing over several F-bombs to keep the movie family-friendly but you'll be surprised at how often the words simply do not match the lips.Skip the sequel. Enjoy this movie for what it is, though it could have been better if it were a few shades darker. And lookout for a hilarious cameo from the director as Richard's dad/butler.The Blu-ray looks great in 1.85:1 1080p, the best the film has ever looked on home video by a longshot. The DTS HD-MA 2.0 sound really does make the constant ADR even more obvious. The menu has the nerve to list &#34;extras&#34; (plural) but offers only a single trailer.There also appears to be many other cuts and edits to this movie on the Blu-ray to make it less raunchy that might irritate some fans. I distinctly remember the film being more adult than this (but I am used to the UK 15-rated version not the US PG-13 version featured on this disc).

$review_text.: In this film, as has-been tennis player Peter Colt surprisingly ascends to prominence, his agent manages to line him up with a new Frito Lay potato chip to endorse, called "Surprisingly Zesty." This, to me, is as good a label as any when trying to describe this film. WIMBLEDON is surprisingly zesty. Tennis, in the states, is fairly popular but not as huge as the big three sports. So to say that this romantic sports film manages to be very entertaining is an unexpected triumph.Love is such a strange racket, especially when it comes with no strings attached (sorry). WIMBLEDON tells of what happens when British tennis pro Peter Colt, on the very last legs of his career (once ranked 11th in the world, he's now 119th), meets young and fiery American, Lizzie Bradbury, as she competes for the very first time in the Wimbledon tournament, the most hallowed of grand slams. Sparks go up, and Peter and Lizzie venture into a mutually agreed carefree romance.Peter, having earned a wild card berth into the tournament but having already decided to retire immediately afterwards, finds his game suddenly elevated. And, because athletes are ridiculously superstitious, he assumes his unexpected success stems from his fling with Lizzie, as, so far, he's spent the eve of each of his Wimbledon matches with her. As he keeps winning, the pressure is on to maintain the romantic routine. This, even as he begins to seriously fall for Lizzie. On the other hand, Lizzie finds herself losing her game face and focus. And, this, as she begins to seriously fall for Peter.So there goes the carefree romance...I happen to dig tennis. I date back to Sampras, Agassi, Graf, Hingis (when she was at the top of the world), and even as far back as my man John McEnroe. But most folks I know just aren't that into tennis. However, regarding WIMBLEDON, you don't have to be a fan of the sport to get into the story. This is tennis made accessible and the play on the court is grippingly presented. You actually get into the matches. Paul Bettany has that slim, athletic build to convincingly pull off his role, and he did plenty of the stunts (even if, a lot of times, the tennis ball had to be inserted graphically). One only wishes that Kirsten Dunst had been on the court more (but, no, she isn't as convincing as Bettany on the tennis court).I don't know too much of Paul Bettany. I've only ever seen him in two other films, the rollickingA Knight's Tale (Special Edition)(he plays Geoffrey Chaucer) and the mediocreFirewall (Widescreen Edition)(where he plays the lead villain). This is actually Paul Bettany's first time as a romantic lead, yet I wasn't all that surprised by how easily he shouldered that role. Guy simply spews that casual charisma (these Brit gents all must attend How To Be Disarming and Urbane 101). Of course, his rootability is enhanced by the film's use of "radiohead," a device in which the audience is allowed to listen to Peter's turmoiled, neurotic thoughts during his matches. It's fun listening to his mind state scale increasingly frantic heights, the deeper he advances. Peter Colt is such a warm, wry, and engaging character. You can't help but pull for this underdog, on and off the court.I don't want to say too much about Kirsten Dunst, 'cause I've been crushing on her for a while now. I'll just end up gushing like a numbnut. But, listen, the romance is frothy and light and easy to swallow, buoyed by Bettany and Dunst's sparkling chemistry. Even if you don't dig the tennis play, the love story makes you want to stick around. Not to mention, WIMBLEDON is pretty funny, with one of my favorite moments taking place during one of Peter's matches and involving a sheepish Jon Favreau.The leads are ably supported by Sam Neill (as Lizzie's stern pops), Jon Favreau (as Peter's dubiously sly agent), Nicolaj Coster Waldau (as Peter's German friend and practice partner), and a fresh-faced James McAvoy (as Peter's brother, who bets against Peter in his matches). I particularly enjoyed the relationship between Peter and Dieter, it comes off with such effortless warmth. Tennis bedrocks such as Chris Evert, John McEnroe, Mary Carillo, and John Barrett (the voice of English tennis) give their seal of approval by being in the movie as themselves. This opens up several funny moments with Johnny Mac poking fun of his (in)famous personality. The film crew received permission to shoot scenes on Wimbledon grounds, this lending the picture another layer of authenticity.Who wins Wimbledon? Who loses? Does Peter end up being an unhappy tennis director at a posh health club? Will Lizzie manage to curb her temper and refocus her drive? Does John McEnroe drop any F bombs?Look, just go see the movie.

$REVIEW.: I started watching the show when it went into syndication 5 - 6 years ago. I was never able to catch it during its regular time slot. The TV stations in my area did not show the syndicated episodes in order and mixed up episodes from different seasons.  So, unlike most Frasier fans, I had no context of episodes with their prospective seasons when I got my hands on the first two sets of Frasier DVDs.  I just assumed that all of the shows I saw on TV were recent and NOT FROM THE FIRST SEASON.  Boy, was I wrong.This DVD set is absolutely amazing.  Most of the episodes I had seen before, but I had no idea that they came from the first season. Most TV shows are very "green" their first season and when compared with subsequent seasons, the "greenness" becomes even more apparent.  It's so easy to point out the first shows from the later ones due to weaker writing, character development, and acting. Even weaker set designs and costumes/wardrobe are tell-tale signs of a TV show's first season. However, Frasier hit the ground running and was on mark from the very first show, "The Good Son".This show demonstrated an enormous amount of development within it first 24 episodes.  I agree with another Amazon reviewer who said that the show's success was due to the writers/creators/producers taking only the name "Dr. Frasier Crane" and his basic personality from "Cheers", but developing a whole new setting and set of characters for "Frasier".  To me, this is why the show had such a strong first season. Due to this desire to set itself apart from "Cheers", "Frasier" developed a strong sense of "self" rarely seen in a first season.  However, Frasier never attempted to sever its ties to "Cheers".  It just refused to become Cheers, part II.Although, I love Frasier, I was taken aback when I first laid eyes on his younger brother Niles.  Niles is definitely my favorite character.  This leads me to another reason for the show's excellent first season.  Its star was surrounded by highly talented actors with well-developed characters.  Sure, Frasier, by himself, was a delight to see, but without Niles, Daphne, Roz, Martin, and even Eddie the dog...where would this show had gone?  Even minor characters at Frasier's radio station (KACL) are unforgettable (like Bulldog, Gil, and Noel). These supporting characters were powerful in their own right, but never overpowered Frasier's star billing.So, this DVD set is definitely worth getting and unlike other TV shows that are now on DVD, you don't have to wait until the second, third or even fourth season DVDs to come out before getting the best shows.  Frasier is worth getting from the very first episode onward.  It's brilliance came through from the beginning and if such a thing were possible, each episode and season that followed improved and built upon the previous.  It's rare for a show to do that and this is why Frasier will be spinning in my DVD player for years to come.

That is the meaning of true love. What struck me was the evil that Nazism was. I cannot even begin to understand the level of hate and man's inhumanity to man, that was Nazism. Even in Hungary, when the hate had spread into that country, the Hungarians turned against their own countrymen. I had heard a lot about Ann Frank, but nothing about Hannah.

$REVIEW.: A SEPARATION is a film about a group of good, decent people who fall into enormous, soul-shattering ethical and legal dilemmas in part because they are trying to do good.  To be righteous.  To be free from sin.  To take care of their children.  And it all falls apart so easily, right before our eyes.Set in modern day Iran, the issues of the film are very much rooted in that society...and yet they are universally understandable.  It's a tiny story and it's a big story that speaks to everyone.  It's important that the film is set in Iran, because of the laws and culture that will weigh so heavily on the main characters.  But it feels surprisingly relevant and very close & credible.The film begins as the main couple of the story, Nader & Simin, are appearing before a judge of some kind.  They are intelligent, attractive, educated and fond of each other.  But their lives are about to take divergent paths.  Simin is asking for a divorce from her husband, because she wants to be able to leave the country with her teenage daughter, who is a bright, studious girl with a great future ahead of her in a country that doesn't put so many obstacles in front of women.  Nader does not want to leave, because he feels he must stay and take care of his Alzheimer's -ridden father.  Simin advocates that the father go into a home, because he doesn't know his son...and because the welfare of their daughter comes first.  Simin seems both callous to her husband's desire to tend to his beloved father, and she seems completely right too.  Her daughter NEEDS a chance to fulfill her promise.The parents dote on their terrific girl.  She loves them.  She loves her wretched grandfather.  They are a terrific if troubled family.  But Simin moves out of the house, and Nader must hire a woman to tend to his father while he is at work.  Razieh comes to the job from a long commute away, accompanied by her small daughter.  She is likely from the country, and wears more traditional, conservative clothing.  She is lower class, devote, shy and frightened by the job she has undertaken.From this simple setup develops a complicated story of misunderstandings, cultural roadblocks, honor betrayed, legal machinations and the sickening realization that everyone is digging themselves into holes from which they cannot emerge unscathed.I don't want to tell you anymore, because the joy of this film lies in part in discovering its secrets.  All the characters, even Razieh's hot-headed husband, are mostly good people who make some small but unfortunate choices.  It's a chilling film in many ways, because while the passions run hot in these characters as they fight for their souls, they must maintain a mantle of politeness and respect.  Their culture demands manners, even as it prevents them from expressing what is REALLY on their minds.This is a small story, as I said.  It involves primarily two families and their troubles.  Nothing that happens would ever make the news, even on a small scale.  The world churns on around them, completely oblivious to their plight.  And yet, for the viewer, the film quietly grabs your attention in its opening moments, and simply does not let go.  In part, this is because the script (Oscar nominated) makes each and every person a distinct, fleshed-out and understandable character.  If you've ever wondered what folks mean when they decry a movie's lack of character development, check out A SEPARATION.  You'll understand what true characters are.The film is brilliantly acted, as well.  Every part offers juicy moments for the actors and they tear into their work.  Peyman Moadi as Nader and Leila Hatami as Simin are fantastic, but no one really lags behind.  Young Sarina Farhadi as the daughter Termeh is heartbreaking, and special notice must go to Ali-Asghar Shahbazi as the elderly father.  He's so immersed in his role, you forget utterly that this is an actor portraying a man with Alzheimer's.For me, 2011 was not a great year for movies.  Very few moved me.  THE ARTIST and THE DESCENDANTS were delightful and excellent...but did not make me lean forward in my seat in utter engrossment.  Finally, A SEPARATION (even though I saw it in 2012) came along and in its subtle power, made me remember how worthwhile the wait is for a truly great movie.
$SUMMARY.: Likely the best film of 2011.  Gripping and devastating.

$REVIEW.: We've got Eraserhead, Elephant Man, Blue Velvet & Wild At Heart. Extras are the same, but, we get new extras for Elephant Man, that Industrial Symphony & a bonus "mystery disc."Problem is, we've already seen most of this before. The mystery disc, & the 5.1 new sound track on Blue Velvet is the only real thing of interest. I didn't care for a good majority of the contents on the mystery disc, but I'll admit others would find them interesting. And I have no interest in that symphony thing, but others would.The Eraserhead soundtrack, Dumbland, & the Short Film set were completely unnecessary. Lynch could have easily included new interviews with people who worked on Eraserhead, or done brand new interviews on Blue Velvet, but he made no such effort. There was no excuse to release some of these never before released things (Wild At Heart + deleted scenes, Elephant Man + new extras, Blue Velvet + 5.1 track & new interviews, or Industrial Symphony) on their own. This is obviously a George Lucas style cash grab, & this isn't surprising considering he charged an extreme amount to ship internationally from his old website. Lynch should be ashamed of himself.

You can almost smell the superb food of the French Quarter as you dance on down Bourbon Street.Stories of people you come to love can make you laugh, or cry, or both.New Orleans is a very special place, below sea level, the scent of magnolias in the air, street musicians, jazz unlike anywhere else.

The script in this case is nicely coalesced with a poetic flow that carries the viewer along as if  floating down a river on a slow Summers day.

The characters are not well established from beginning to end -- so you honestly don't care whether they live or die.  Also, I think they put George Clooney in this movie because you're so familiar with his character and he's instantly likeable (because the other characters are so underdeveloped).  Unfortunately he's in the movie about 20 mins -- and that's it.  The story is very thin and repetitive.  Sandra Bullock does an OK job in this movie, but there's not much to the &#34;acting&#34;.

$review_text.: If you're into action and intrigue and you're convinced that the folks on the top of the heap, with a few exceptions, are corrupt and quick to kill anyone who gets in their way, this may be a film for you.  The same is true if you're inclined to think that grunt-level folks, rendered dispensable by the plutocrats, are the ones most likely to manifest decency and patriotism, even though they're often the unwitting tools of unbridled, ruthlessly rational international capital.  If you find invocation of concepts like "international capital" gratuitously political or too left-leaning for your taste, you can just substitute something like "greed on a massive scale, undeterred by the utility of mass murder."  Pretty much the same thing.There's nothing subtle about The Shooter, but it's loaded with suspenseful fun.  Danny Glover and Ned Beatty have always been at their best playing bad guys and they do not disappoint.  Elias Koteas is less well known, but in his sinister and ugly way, he is just as effective.  Mark Wahlberg performs ably as the shooter, once abandoned to the enemy for geopolitical reasons. So much for no Marine is ever left behind. But Wahlberg is still a sucker for a phony appeal to his patriotism.  However, when he realizes that he's being used and teams up with an FBI agent played by Michael Pena, they're just about unstoppable.The end of the film is wonderfully satisfying, so long as you remember that this is fairly heavy-handed fiction in which the protagonist, Wahlberg, approximates the status of a super hero.  Nevertheless, the film is nothing if not timely, something that appeals to the cynicism that rightly suffuses the contemporary world.  Only the most meager of intellectual fare, but spectacularly action filled.  I've seen it three times and still enjoy it.

$REVIEW.: I've been watching TV from its early days in the 1950s through the present and am convinced that Remington Steele was as good as general audience TV gets. In fact, I think it was the best TV series ever made. Remington Steele was a suberbly done combination of action, adventure, and romantic comedy with very good scripts and fine acting by attractive and appealing people. It was -- and still is -- consistently entertaining and no other series was better. I agree that the addition of Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs made the second and later seasons even better than the first season, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first season. If you are a fan of Remington Steele you've probably already bought the DVDs of the first three seasons and you'll love this final release too. If you've never seen Remington Steele or have forgotten how good this show was, please do yourself a favor and order this DVD set now. Better still, order the earlier releases to enjoy now while you're waiting for this set of the final two seasons to be released.

This is an intermediate/advanced DVD with very clear instruction.  The costumes in the performance sections are beautiful.  I adore the music in all three numbers.  If you are a beginner, get this for inspiration!Neon teaches a fabulous routine.  I did not feel that it went well with the music, but the music was lovely, and whether or not it went with the music, the choreography is phenomenal.  It is well worth practicing the combinations she teaches.  I also like the armbands and fingerless gloves she wore in the instructional part.  It makes it very easy to see what she is doing with her hands and arms.Sera.... Wow!  I could not wipe the smile off my face as I watched her in this performance!  This is a modern piece that includes fantastic combinations of isolations.  Even if you don't like modern, try some of these combinations in a traditional drum solo.Ayshe teaches a gorgeous routine with Isis wings.  She gives some great tips for keeping control.

$review_text.: If you haven't seen The hill's have eyes, do not bother to check on thsi one. This sequel is as bad as the worst day of your life. The movie is filled with very dumb flashback (scenes taken from the first movie) that have to explain a movie that does make any sense.He even brought back to life michael berryman's character, wich in the first movie was creepy and morbid, now is so clumsy and dumb that is not even funny. This is by the way, wes craven's weakest entry. look for the first one, a pretty good exploitation classic!!!! but this one is very very lame!

$review_text.: The love for the guns developed for Bart Tare will be the great gate which eventually will carry to hell . All a complex web of relationship and curious affinities he finds out in woman  who seems his mirror image in female version . This weird fascination goes in crescendo , because is there any caprice you know which diminishes through the years ?This captivating story began as a story in The Saturday Evening Post written by MacKinlay Cantor And since the tragic ending of these two desperate lovers keeps a discrete distance respect to Romeo and Juliet  , so it is very difficult classify it just only as a film noir , It is a love story too , with all his nastiness and lack of poery but loaded of the sinister shadows of that age so close to the End of the WW2 . In this particular universe and isolated microcosmos each one of them tries to seek desperately the other half . The sense of loneliness and absence of emotional center become them in two errant satellites without future because they only live for the inmediat sensations ; the clear metaphor of a society without goals and hope, lliving just only for the present showing the triviality and the absurdity of their livesForgotten for many years by all but true film connoisseurs, Gun Crazy has been object of veneration and rendition since its rediscovering in 1967.Watch the famous secene : the one camera shot bank holdup.This film was cleArly the inspiration for Artur Penn who filmed in 1967 Bonnie and Clyde.

$REVIEW.: The dvd contains one set of workout, consisting of three different dancing sequences:-Warm-up-Maculele (high-impact, cardio)-Samba Reggae (mid-impact cardio)-Capoeira (low impact cardio with kicks and abdominal works on the floor)-Cool downPlus, bonus materials including a more challenging Samba.You will like this dvd if you are:-looking for a workout in small space
The most space-requiring movement is probably the "turn and extend your leg and arms" in the Maculele

But this is also doable in limited space, because this does not require moving many steps to the same direction

The only sequence that requires moving many steps to the same direction is the bonus Samba, which is not part of the regular workout sequence-interested in trimming your body with different movements

The movements in the dvd are easy but refreshingly different from these from other dvds such as Jennifer Galardi's
Movements in Brazilian Body dvd trim your body differently than do these from more conventional workout dvds-looking for a workout dvd in non-studio surrounding


This dvd was shot in a beautiful surrounding from HawaiiYou may not like this dvd if you are:-looking for an instructional dvd that teaches real latin dancing

This dvd is for getting fit and not for learning latin dancing
None of the 3 sequences include real latin dance steps but just flavors of exotic movements-uncomfortable without tight cue and/or step guide

I happen to like loose cues, but some people who like Jen Galardi-type, tight cuing instructors may find this dvd less greatI recommend that you try the sample clip available at Amazon


It's the first 5 minutes from the Maculele and gives you a good idea of what this workout is like.

$review_text.: Although the Pride and prejudice tv series with Colin Firth and Jenifer Ehle impressed me, I have to admit that my favorite adaptation of a Jane Austen novel remains Emma Thompson's and Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility.This movie is an adaptation of Jane Austen's first novel in which three sisters, named Elinor, Marianne, Margaret, and their mother have to move out of their home and relocate in a small cottage, due to the death of their father whose house has become the property of their brother-in-law and of his avaricious wife. At the same time, Elinor and Marianne both fall in love with gentlemen, played by Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Greg Wise, (who became in real life the husband of Emma Thompson herself) and whose lives are not what they seem to be.As I don't want to reveal too much of the plot, I just want to say that what really impressed me was how Ang Lee managed to keep his direction very simple. There are no useless close-ups, no overbearing music and no over acting with his actors. Instead, he just lets them interpret their roles in the most subtlest way. And, unlike certain Jane Austen adaptations, Ang Lee doesn't use flashbacks to explain incidents that occur in the past or to enrich the character's dialogues. Instead, he just lets the actors speak and explain what happened. Finally, Ang Lee's shots look just like asian paintings and add details that were not included in the novel, but enhance the context of the british society in Jane Austen's novel, such as the grand ball which instead of occurring in a big room, happens through different rooms, each divided by a certain social status.As for Emma Thompson's very funny script, she manages to condense the novel's plot in two hours, with such efficiency that she doesn't lose any of the important elements of the story. Not only that, she also gives room to certain characters like Margaret, and even enriches the story with scenes that never occurred in the book, like the discussion between Elinor and Edward in the library as they manage to get Margaret out of her hiding spot. The scene is so funny and believable in its dialogue that you really think that it was in the book, which was something that a professor, or a viewer I'm not too sure, told Emma Thompson and her producer, something they both revealed in the commentaries on the DVD.Speaking of special features, I loved the details and information that Emma Thompson and her producer gave in their commentaries, some of which were also noted in the production diaries of the movie. You get to learn more about the movie 's production and also on her work as screenwriter and all the modifications she had to do to transpose the novel into a movie.Finally, there is, in the special features, an excerpt from the Golden Globes ceremony in 1996, during which Emma Thompson received a prize and did a great speech, imagining what Jane Austen would have said if she had been at that ceremony.In the end, I don't think the movie would have been as successful and as funny if Emma Thopmson and Ang Lee had not been working on this movie, which really deserved its Oscar for best scriptwriting, Golden Globe, and golden bear at the Berlin film festival.
$SUMMARY.: My favorite adaptation of a Jane Austen book

$review_text.: L'enfant terrible, Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds), has specialized integrating his encyclopedic knowledge of exploitive movies into reinvented, genre films stocked with top actors and highlighted by dialogue enriched scenes.  The ultimate revenge tale in the guise of a slavery drama morphed into a western, Django Unchained is a highly entertaining adventure with a heavy dose of violence.It is the pre-Civil War South where cruel plantation owners treat slaves inhumanely, and guns rule the landscape.  A former dentist, Dr Schultz (Christoph Waltz), is a bounty hunter and seeks his quarry by enlisting the aid of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx).  It seems bounty hunting is a very lucrative profession, and it facilitates Django's freedom and a means to search for and rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), from a wealthy slave owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). As Schultz and Django devise a plan to win Hildy's freedom, Candie, who relies on the counsel of his slave-confident, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), begins to suspect a ruse and with time running out, it leads to an explosive, bloody end.Although his films tend to function and be appreciated for their parts rather than the whole, there are, of course, the Tarantino trademarks.  He knows how to build a scene, and part of the fun is the delicious interplay among the key characters.  As in most of his films, his characters are put in situations where there is an inevitability, a destiny if you will as the tension and looming threat of violence gets unbearable at times particularly in the climactic dinner scene.  He also has a couple of scenes early on which are meant to fool the audience in which things appear one way but are really a clever misdirection.Foxx is quite the stud as the determined former slave, and DiCaprio is cast convincingly against type. Yet it is Waltz who shines here, and he makes the most of a role written for him.As he has done in all his previous films, Tarantino has resurrected former stars and character actors in numerous supporting roles.  Part of the fun is trying to recognize a face under heavy makeup.  Try identifying Michael Parks, Tom Savini, Robert Carradine, Bruce Dern, Russ Tamblyn, Don Stroud, Franco Nero (star of the original titled film), Don Johnson, Dennis Christopher, or James Remar.The film is heavily influenced by spaghetti westerns with the long stares and moody musical score.  The action scenes are brutal and at times over the top; when has it not been so in a Tarantino film? One day perhaps, he should make a more intimate, gentle film to prove his versatility (like David Lynch demonstrated in The Straight Story).At 165 minutes, the film could use a bit leaner running time, but it is good fun if you aren't put off by the  periodic, graphic violence.  Tarantino may be a film geek with a nasty streak, but he definitely knows how to put together engaging, crowd pleasers, even if much of the material is cleverly recycled from older, obscure films.  He has devised a crackerjack piece of entertainment, and while he says he wants to make a very limited amount of films in his career, if they continue to be as popular and well written as this and his previous work, we may have to wait a couple years or more for the next one.  For his fans, it will be worth the wait.

$REVIEW.: I have to say that I have watched a lot of movies, probably like everyone else on this page. However, I consider myself to be sort-of a film buff and I think 8 1/2 is one of the best movies ever made. I can completely understand why some people do not like the film, or feel that others who do are trying to be stuck up, superior, artsy fartsy jerks. But, make no mistake, 8 1/2 is an amazing movie; and, even though you may not understand everything, that does not make the film "bad". Some movies take patience, maybe even some research, and sometimes a few more viewings, before the viewer can fully appreciate what the director is trying to accomplish. Some of my favorite movies I hated the first time I watched them. Yet, I gave those movies another try because I thought that I must have overlooked something,  that for some reason I was not glimpsing the true vision of the Director.Most people want to see movies that they have already seen. Many movies are just repeat plot tricks, with the same characters and heros and anti-heros. Doesn't anyone want to see a movie that attempts to unveil a part of the soul, not one that simply aims at that base desire to be entertained. Just give 8 1/2 a try, I don't think It could hurt!

$review_text.: THE CAT'S MEOW (2002, dir. Peter Bogdanovich) is one of those films I'm glad I have finally seen, yet simultaneously glad it sank with all those other immediate-post-9-11 films. It's a passable film, but a hard one to review because I see it as a matter of taste.William Randolph Hearst (Edward Hermann), Mr. Yellow Journalism himself, is aboard his Oneida yacht holding a birthday celebration for studio founder Thomas H. Ince (Cary Elwes). It was November, 1924, and sometime during the cruise Ince fell ill (apparently he did not die on the yacht as has been stated). Hearst cut the cruise very short, putting in at San Diego, where Ince was carried off the yacht. 1927 was a long time ago, yet the gossip flew for generations about possible foul play.David Emery, of About.com, once an employee at the old 1918 Ince Building, known as "Ince's Mansion", has written about Ince's ghost spooking the building. Of course, one never knows about the weird and surreal Roaring '20s. Fatty Arbuckle's mess is an example...but here, Bogdanovich tries to conjure up a plausible tale of what might have happened.Namely, Hearst mistook Ince for Chaplin, shot him in the head from behind, then tried to tell himself Ince would be fine. Since Chaplin (a brilliant Eddie Izzard) lusted after the interesting Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunce), and as she was Hearst's little girlfriend, well....Elinor Glyn (Joanna Lumley), notorious for her famous novel "Three Weeks", may or may not have been on that cruise. The story isn't straight about who else was present. (For example, Paul Whiteman, my favorite bandleader, is mentioned and shown at the end--but he wasn't in the film!) Here, Glyn cleverly narrates the beginning and ending, talking about how they wouldn't even be human if it weren't for Hollywood culture. I tend to think that was far-fetched dialogue because 1920s Hollywood wasn't exactly what it is today.Jennifer Tilly turns in a chilling performance of the wicked witch film reviewer/gossip columnist Louella Parsons, who was the "most feared person in show business" for decades due to her acerbic nastiness. Hearst put her in that position, and the film suggests it was because she saw him commit the shooting.Well, if the cast isn't enough to give headaches, the acting is none too sharp for my taste. The story was smooth and clean, as was the cinematography (no silly bobbing just because they're on a yacht). Hermann's portrayal of Hearst is just scary enough, though Hermann is probably the worst actor in the bunch. Bogdanovich has a flair for clean simplicity and beauty in film, I'll say that much for him.My huge pet peeve in film--that the camera bobs until you puke because the action takes place on a ship or boat--was NOT an error Bogdanovich committed. In fact what he did was brilliant: he made the sea-line in the background bob up and down, in relation to the boat and the camera was steady. The strategy is beautiful to behold, and I wish directors would have learned from this.Somehow it reminds me of Izzard's Chaplin. This is not Robert Downey tripping over himself; Izzard is brilliant yet low-key. I can imagine that is exactly what Chaplin in real life was like. Reflecting Izzard's own habit, Chaplin is forever spouting possible scenes and asking Marion Davies, "Would that be funny?"By the way, "The cat's meow" was Ince's snide, jealous description of the Oneida in the film. I cannot confirm whether he ever really said that. Then again, it's impossible to confirm anything here except there was a birthday cruise party Hearst gave to Ince. Once off the boat and home in bed, Ince lingered for two days in a coma before dying. The doctor put "heart failure" on the death certificate.Make of this what you will, both the movie and the real-life "mystery". To me, it's better than so-so, but I won't be acquiring this for my DVD library anytime soon....

Without the distractions of fake blood and trap-doors, the viewer is able to focus on the outstanding performances of the cast
 George Hearn may be twenty years older, but his acting, which is phenomenal, makes up for any of the former fulness that might be missing from his voice

Patty Lupone presents a far darker Mrs

Lovett than Angela Lansbury did, but her characterization clears up some of the ambiguities of motivation that were present in her predecessor's trademark interpretation; Lupone's powerful voice blends well with Hearn's


 Neil Patrick Harris was pleasantly surprising in the role of Toby, and the voices of the supporting characters, Anthony, Johanna, Lucy, Judge Turpin, the Beadle, Pirelli, are simply splendid.

$review_text.: Andy Goldsworthy creates art that a 5-year old can understand, stacking rocks, arranging leaves, piling sticks, drawing in the snow.  His "work" (as he keeps calling it) is simple in concept, but maybe not so simple to execute as well as he does.And that is both the strength of it, and its downfall.  The simplicity is unpretentious and pure in a way that art very rarely is, these days.  At the same time it is fun and silly and unsophisticated in a way that makes Andy's serious pronouncements about "his work" and "my art" sound like a 5-year old kid who never got his parents' approval.  The fact that he spends so much energy building contructs of such fragile beauty, which are almost always blown away by the wind or tides until nothing remains -- and the fact that he gets so agitated when the inevitable collapse occurs -- make you wonder after his sanity.  Why does he torture himself so, what drives him to such Sisyphean frustration?The film, by Thomas Reidelsheimer, deserves five stars for the languid portrait it paints of the hunger artist.  Like his following film Touch The Sound, it is a masterful exploration of a driven personality, one which manages to both illuminate -- and puzzle over -- the subject artist.  Both films also benefit from stunning soundtracks by Fred Frith.

$REVIEW.: I have been in love with this musical since I first saw it in Philadelphia in the late-1980s, and had been eagerly anticipating the movie for months. It did not disappoint! The live recording (rather than lip-synch) works marvelously. Every note, emotion, and tone is perfect. I particularly appreciated the director's comments, which helped me understand how Tom Hooper cut portions of some songs, reordered songs or scenes, and overall improved the flow of the story from the stage version, while retaining the full impact of the musical. This appears to be a &#34;love-it-or-hate-it&#34; movie. My wife and I loved it, but that does not mean it's for everyone. For my money, Les Miz should have won the Oscar for Best Picture, and Hugh Jackman for Best Actor.

Some reviewers have applauded the presence of the original sponsor messages on these discs. Personally, I don't like them, but the great thing is that you have the choice of playing the episodes with or without the advertising. Some of the difference may be that as Americans, the other reviewers remember the shows that way, with some nostalgia.

$review_text.: There are a number of things in this movie for the Holmes purist to pick apart, the identity of the villain being just one, but in the name of being fair, there are some good points as well.I was happy to see someone taking on the tough job of writing an new Holmes story that did not lift whole sections from the Doyle originals. Really, after you've watched the Six Napoleons with Jeremy Brett, do you really want to watch the same story with someone else as Holmes? So, even though the plot has some gaping holes in it, you have to give the writers a nod of thanks. New Sherlock Holmes projects have been few and far between lately.The plot does take liberties with the original canon; since another reviewer has already spilled the beans there - with no spoiler alert, I might add, I'll move on. By the very nature of the story, Holmes is unable to do much in his own defense and Watson too is shoved off to the side to make way for the Irregulars. This definitely makes it a young adult/teen adventure movie and it does frustrate me when the Great Detective sits in Baker Street motionless while all this goes on. I liked the concept of Holmes being the prime suspect but it also puts the number one character on the shelf.Jonathan Pryce is all right as Holmes but, no disrespect intended, I wish he were a bit younger for this role. He does capture Holmes' impatience with the slower intellects around him and he has several great lines - especially the one about 'celebrity being the last refuge of the imbecile.' That alone is worthy of the Holmes we know and love. His relationship with the Irregulars is up and down; sometimes they give him no slack - or trust - which is somewhat surprising, given what they do for him in the Doyle stories. Sometimes Holmes is extraordinarily patient with them, especially the abrasive Sadie, who is an actively annoying character. Watson is well played by Bill Paterson, a loyal, jolly soul who is not above smiling smugly as Holmes jabs at Scotland Yard. Watson is not buffoon in this one and that's all to the good.The Irregulars are a mixed bag; there are a couple of promising young actors, particularly Finch, and a couple who are really not very good at all. Some Americanisms creep into their speech and the net result is they really don't seem like the 'street arabs' Conan Doyle described but more like modern teens out on a lark.Bottom line; if you're looking for another Holmes movie to be just as good as the Jeremy Brett series, this isn't it. There is a lot to find fault on and pick apart. But if you'd like some new Sherlock Holmes video to watch and you can be flexible enough to stand some revisions to the Canon, you might want to give this one a try.

$REVIEW.: This is the best of Chuck Norris and it has conspiracy and team action that almost all his fans expect when he does his performance mostly in t.v. series like the president's man and logan's war. I was waiting when the dvd comes out that has these three movies in one collection of chuck norris. I can't hardly wait to watch this movie again and I can surely say that this is Chuck Norris's awesome work.

$REVIEW.: The thing I enjoyed best about this movie was its unique presentation. There are hundreds, if not thousands of traditional Halloween movies that follow a rather cheesy formula. Not that there's anything wrong with that- there is, after all, a comfort to be found in the familiarity of that oft tested formula. However, it's much more rewarding (not to mention refreshing), to watch a Halloween movie that embraces something original, while maintaining many of the traditional elements (werewolves, cranky hermits with secrets, etc.).The unique approach that I speak of is the decision to tell several "short stories" in the film, rather than one continuous arc. While each of these are quite enjoyable on their own (though the first one is uncharacteristically morbid for the collection, and I wish its placement had been altered), the true payoff comes as the movie progresses. It is then, as the collection of stories wraps up, that we find they WERE connected all along, and part of a bigger story. Generally funny and well produced, this is a great Halloween movie with something different to bring to the table.

$REVIEW.: I was lucky enough to see this for the very first time at a free screening at Pershing Square in Downtown Los Angeles, and even though we were a few miles from Sunset Boulevard I still can't think of a better place to have your eyeballs permanently branded by the sight of MISS Gloria Swanson, THE camp Queen of the Highest Order, sliding down that staircase for her final "close up". She is fantastic, mad fun in this film, and you will laugh uproariously at some of her lines- "I have oil fields in Bakersfield Pumping PUMPING PUMPING!" was one that i cannot write without laughing. And what a great sport she was- this former silent film queen who had seen her popularity diminish, Norma Desmond style, after the advent of talkies- and far from denying the fact she reveled in it and even poked fun at herself with this, her most famous role. And pay attention to her physicality in this- as a former silent star, she understood better than anyone how to gesticulate, to use your face and your hands, and her every gesture is dripping with gaudy grandness. The pictures may have gotten smaller, darling, but she who laughs last, laughs hardest. I treasure the very moment this film entered my life, frankly, and I insist! that you must! see it!

$review_text.: The title of my review might make it seem as though I was somewhat anxious for the end of the movie to arrive. In some ways, that is true. This movie was supposed to be a comedy, but I honestly didn't find myself laughing at all. There were a few moments that made me consider laughing, but nothing really stood out as being funny. It definitely seemed like the exact opposite of a comedy. When I like a movie, I usually think to myself whether I'd want to watch that movie again someday or not. I didn't find myself answering yes to that for this movie. Am I saying the movie was bad in my opinion? No. It's just not a movie that I'd recommend my friends watch if they haven't already seen it. I would not recommend it to avid fans of Hilary Duff. So basically, to me, this was an okay movie--not great, but not terrible either.

He's better evil, but he's still really top notch good guy
Kristanna Loken is the best, sexy, strong and I was just completely blown away
I didn't know how Terminator could beat her


With a new actor as John Connor, and a Claire Danes as the girl for him


She looked kinda old to be his girlfriend, but she just looks older then she is

$review_text.: A film about "nothing".A sheriff gets his legs bitten off and yells "Ow!"A five year old (maybe older) asks her grandma (and I paraphrase) "...now that Brody's (Mr


Ow!) dead, will he be coming back"?A shark has presence of mind to call Liberty Travel and find out exactly where the Brody's are staying in The Bahamas.An Aeroflot pilot watches and comes to love the scene where Michael Caine allows the five year old in his lap while piloting a multi-engine Cessna and do dive-bombing runs

Seven years later the captain of Aeroflot Flight 593 allows his 15 year old daughter to take the left seat, where upon she inadvertently disconnects the autopilot and the Airbus A-310 dice bombs into a Siberian mountain.Ellen Brody gets very Billy/Sonny Landham from Predator and senses the shark just like Billy sensed the Rasta alien.Said shark doesn't like ebing photographed and roars exactly like Spot from The Munsters whenever he's flashed.For some reason the shark explodes when Ellen Brody puts on the proverbial strap-on and rams a ship's mast right down his throat.Mario Van Peebles lives after being used as a chew-toy by said exploding shark


 Blood all over the place, but ole Mario's Rastafarian character is cracking wise, which is too bad because he is really, really annoying


 His death would have been a highlight of the flick.So!  Do I recommend this?  Sure, why not?  Of course it's production value (except for the cinematography, thatpart is actually really nice) is worse than a first year undergrad film student

 But get yourself buzzed on a nice spliff and you'll think you're watching the greatest comedy of all.

$REVIEW.: Get Smart continues for its' second season,Sep/66 through to April/67;and there's no let up in the humour and fun.We get intoduced to long running series KAOS agent and fan favourite Siegfried,played wonderfully over the top by Bernie Kopell(the later ships doctor on the Love Boat).He's an ex-Nazi who has definitely got his knickers in a spy twist.Max continues to get himself and Agent#99 in and out of jams by the skin of his teeth;even in spite of himself.The thing with Max is his heart and loyalties are always in the right place even though his skills are sometimes hit and miss.It's always funny to see that Stan Laurel-ish look come over his face when ever he commits a faux-paux,verbally or otherwise.This series' humour is definitely very dry and sometimes the jokes will whiz by before they really sink in,but they are always front and center nonetheless.Included with this set are the usual commentaries with some eps and Barbara Feldon herself is back to introduce each ep.The last three eps in this season were originally to be a Get Smart movie but instead were turned into a three parter.And I guess the show budget wasn't great because instead of "Goldfinger" we have only the ep "Bronzefinger";a direct reference and homage to this series roots,i.e.the James Bond movies starring Sean Connery.And of course they send it up in great style as usual.As with the first season this season is remastered and it looks pretty good.There is a "disturbing" audio portion in "Three spies in a sub",the first ep of disc two,you might keep an ear open for.At about the 19 minute mark and going for about 60 seconds or so,the actors voices suddenly sound like they are in a hollow tunnel.It is probably something in the original film,but I would have thought with today's technology they could have tried to correct it.There are no other special features in this season other than the above mentioned commentaries.This set,as with season one,does contains a 4 page insert with an ep list and a blurb written by one of the shows participants;this one by Dave Ketchum(agent 13).The box set containing all five seasons HAS all the extras,including bloopers,interviews with the writers,producers and a myriad of others but so far none have been included on these individual releases.We might ask why? As an aside I tried to acquire one of those sets into my collection and went through THREE sets and everyone of them had play inhibiting scuff marks/scratches in two or more of the seasons! Just terrible.That is why I am buying the sets individually and so far all is ok.It is just like my experience with the I Love Lucy box set(see my review on that),which I had to eventually give up on and go season by season also.I don't know about you but I have gotten very leery of large box sets anymore.The packaging and quality control seem very lax;the more discs,the more chances of trouble.In concluding,Season Two of Get Smart is bound to please the fans of the five year running,Emmy award winning series as much as Season one did;and even make some new ones.Unfortunately the makers have for some reason decided NOT to include any of the extras that are extant with the box set,which is very unfortunate.However the series dry humour along with its' star Don Adams are the perfect match in the show that spoofed the spy genre of the 60s to the Max!

I think this set is great for what it is an wrap up of the first season of an fantastic show.I say if you love the show buy it since you know one thing for sure will be on the dvd the episodes themselves.

$REVIEW.: Probably a neo-pagan fantasy, but still explores a society that doesn't live by Christian beliefs.  The film takes place off the coast of Scotland, where for several generations a society of pagans have lived by different rules than ordinary society. A religious policeman is beckoned to come and look for a missing child, which he does, and after that it's like a scavenger hunt, with one clue leading to another until the proud and rigid policeman finds himself exactly where the villagers want him to be.  Trapped.Like to add that if you buy the current Region 1 edition of the DVD, you will miss some very good scenes and if you have seen it on video, it doesn't even have the Gently Johnny song.  It's been cut to ribbons.  Keep your old video that runs 102 minutes, though some newer videos say 99 minutes.  Wait until the complete DVD is out in Region 1 (if you're in North America)  I think the whole thing is on DVD in Region 2, but that doesn't' help me.

$review_text.: To be honest, I didn't fall in love with this season of BtVS. It's a very good season but storylines and characterizations are not at their brightest. I don't love The Initiaive or Adam they're all very science fiction and with the addition of commandos we have a military atmosphere this season, too. It's the show's lightest season, we don't have any good character gone bad (Angel, Faith) or a big tragedy. It isn't a familiar BtVS season we are used to.Althought the main plots and Big Bad as not as strong as season 2 and 3, season 4 have very good storylines and episodes. I really like Willow's love for a woman, and it's very good character development. I'm very sad Oz is leaving and I think his character was underused in season 3. Xander and Anya's relationship is very sweet and fun to watch. Giles doesn't have a job, Faith wakes up from her coma. These are nice plots, but I'm not a fan of Riley he seems very stable for Buffy.The season also has one of the worst episodes Where the Wild Things Are. Favorite episodes from this season are: Something Blue, Hush (obviously), Who Are You, Restless. My point for this season is 7.5/10.

$review_text.: ...but it will have its fans; those who enjoy watching cheerleading competitions and those who enjoy watching a lot of skinny actresses run around in skimpy, tight outfits for about an hour and a half.  The plot; Dunst takes over as cheerleading captain for `Lily-White High School' only to discover that the departing captain had stolen all of their routines from an inner city squad at `Mostly Black High School'.  What a moral quandary!  Things really take a wacky turn when the Lily-Whites then have to face the Mostly Blacks at nationals!  Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans may will enjoy the presence of not just Faith, but the overlooked Glorificus as well.  All of the stock teen stereotypes are present in Bring It On, and strangely enough so is the perpetuation of  the `myth' that male cheerleaders are generally Nancy boys.  I would have thought that a movie that is trying to portray cheerleading in a positive light would have tried to avoid that.  One of the males has the `hilarious' predilection of digitally raping his female counterparts while they are performing together.  His victims seem to love it!  Nice message for teenage boys from Hollywood, young girls LOVE unwanted digital penetration!.  Another point of contention is why are the inner city kids the Clovers?  If there is some subliminal message there, I really don't get it.  Maybe it was left on the cutting room floor.  So while the story may have had a little promise, its limited appeal and limiting script assured that the movie wouldn't live up to it.  I can't believe Kirsten Dunst hasn't fired her agent yet for continuing to let her star in these weak teen movies.  It's as if she were aging in reverse.  But, all this aside, I did watch the whole thing and would again.  It just isn't very good, even for a teen movie.

$review_text.: Clint Eastwood kicks off his directorial debut with a flying start

 As late night DJ Dave Garver, he repeatedly gets requests from a seductive female(Jessica Walter) to play Errol Garner's &quot;Misty.&quot;  He soon meets her in his favorite nightspot he frequently plugs on his program


 He sleeps with her; but by morning they have decidedly different ideas about where this is heading
 He intended a casual affair, she dives headfirst into his life and he can't get her out


 He begins to realize that her mental state is debatable


 Things get complicated when Eastwood gets involved with a former girlfriend
 The knife scenes in this movie are fast and furious, and I would compare them to &quot;Psycho.&quot;  Jessica Walter, for my money, is the scariest female psycho we've yet seen
 Sixteen years later, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; adopted this formula, even having the nerve to directly lift some scenes

 Unlike Michael Douglas, Clint Eastwood is single and openly states he's not looking to complicate his life--Michael Douglas is married with a child, and encourages his nemesis more than Clint Eastwood does

 I think Clint is much less deserving of the punishment that follows


 I watched this on a first date with the wonderful woman I'm now engaged to, so at least we have a happy ending!

$REVIEW.: On occasion producers, directors and screenwriters and all of the other hard working and dedicated people involved in an undertaking of this magnitude get it all right, and the result is a masterpiece of cinematography.  The story is a symbolic fantasy revolving around a young woman at the center of intrigue concerning the attempt by the murderous minions of the "Magisterium" to control all human thought and behaviour not only in this universe, but in ALL possible universes.  Strangely apropos vis a vis the current "many universe" theories of physicist David Deutsch and others, the story can be enjoyed by the young and by the young of heart and mind no matter of what physical age as the beautiful cinematography and music, and the well developed plot proceed at a suspenseful but well paced speed to the satisfying and exciting finale.I must say the author's spiritual conceptions are wonderfully imaginative and can be considered to be a part of the growing modern movement which introduces far greater tolerance of different spiritual conceptions than would have ever been allowed in the world of even the recent past.Outstanding movie... and, if your curiosity to learn more details was as mine, you will go out and buy the book - I am reading it with GREAT enjoyment right now!

The one bright light in the whole film is Gibson, who, while a bit hammy, comes off an genuinely creepy. The rest of the 4 tales are a predictable mish-mash of pseudo horror, light gore, and gratuitous nudity and sex. All the directors involved more or less seemed to be phoning n their work, and even Saxon, the only other credible actor in the cast (the rest seemed like they were in a high-school play), pretty much sleepwalked his lines. Interesting that something like Tales From The Crypt, done -- what? -- 30 years earlier, was far superior. Save your money; look for it on cable some late night.

$REVIEW.: Cruel Intentions has been slammed by critics, who have unfairly and unfavourably compared it with 1989's Dangerous Liaisons (both films stem from Choderlos de Laclos's novel, Les Liaisons Dangereuses). Whereas Dangerous Liaisons is fairly faithful to the original, Cruel Intentions manipulates the plot - throwing a twist in the tail - and relocates the milieu from 18th century France to the present-day Upper East Side of New York, where underneath the veneer of respectability, wealthy teenagers plot each other's downfalls.Stepsiblings Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont are two such teenagers. They amuse themselves by arranging reputation-destroying paybacks for those who have wronged them, and make wagers on the outcome. The focus of the movie is Sebastian's attempt to make a conquest of the Headmaster's virginal daughter, Annette (who, in a heavy-handed attempt at symbolism, wears white throughout almost the entire film).However, the movie certainly has some memorable high points, beginning at the very outset where the camera swoops fast and low over what appears to be a grassy park studded with rocks; only after the camera angles away does the viewer realise - with some discomfort - that the park is in fact a graveyard. The opening scenes also introduce the appealing and well-judged soundtrack, which includes artists as diverse as Placebo and Fatboy Slim. The Verve's song, Bittersweet Symphony, is an absolutely perfect 'just desserts' track at the film's conclusion.These kids are incredibly nasty and vindictive, but owing to the verbosity of the script and the almost total lack of adult chaperones appearing on screen, it is difficult at times to remember that they are only teenagers. In the end though, perhaps we just like to see someone be very, very wicked and almost get away with it.

In this fast, funny and disgusting documentary, our narrator and human guinea pig, Morgan Spurlock commits to eating nothing but McDonalds food, three times a day, for one month


There are rules, he has to try everything on the menu at least once, he must "super size" if asked to do so, he can't eat it if it's not the McDonald's menu, and he must walk/exercise about that of a normal America (in this case, no exercise and around a mile of walking a day).In the beginning of the film Spurlock is examined by three doctors and is billed in very good health
Then he begins his experiment


Day one is great but by day 3 Spurlock is throwing up in parking lots

Once over the hump, he begins to eat in stride as his cholesterol goes up, his moods swing, his liver is threatened, and he begins to pack on the pounds

This alone would make an entertaining novelty of a documentary but "Super Size Me" also includes interviews with a man who eats hundreds of Big Macs a year, a PE program in Illinois that's changing how schools look at physical education, another school in Wisconsin that has a healthy alternative to school lunches, as well as interesting and often jaw dropping tidbits about how Americans eat today

Granted it's a bias report and Spurlock does jump to some unproven claims pretty quickly, one being that certain foods might be physically addicting; but overall, this is an eye opening look at not just fast food in America, but our health and this country's corporate greed.The DVD also has some informative extras


There are some deleted scenes and interviews, as well as an interview with  Eric Schlosser, author of "Fast Food Nation"

My personal favorite being an experiment with McDonald french fries


See the movie and read the Eric Schlosser book


You'll never look at your lunch the same way again.

$review_text.: When D-X returned in 2006, WWE dusted off an old D-X video and added matches and put it on dvd to go with the craze of mega-selling D-X merchandise

This shows just how edgy D-X originally was compared to the watered down friendly D-X of today

I recommend what every reviewer says about getting the VHS for the documentary and this dvd for the matches


I think it's funny on the newer D-X video they dropped an s-bomb but it's edited out on this dvd


Also, the matches are all pre-98 so there is no censors on the classic WWF logo and even though most matches are not classic, still fun to watch

A must own for D-X fans or fans who miss the attitude era of the WWF.

$review_text.: ...or "Harold and Kumar go to Camp Crystal Lake", or "Cheech and Chong Meet Jason". Take your pick - all of these titles are a more apt description of this failure than plain old "Friday the 13th".Somehow, the team that so likes to remake classic and semi-classic horror films from way back, managed to butcher a remake of the first three "Friday the 13ths". A seemingly impossible task, but Michael Bay and Marcus Nispel pulled it off.Contrary to the opinion of  many horror film fans and critics, the first two installments of "Friday the 13th" were not bad movies, mainly because they cribbed the atmosphere and even some of the murder set pieces from Mario Bava's body count movie, "Twitch of the Death Nerve".Even the score was an imitation of the classic score from "Psycho" and the iconic  "chhh chhh, haaa, haaa" was borrowed from the end of an old Pink Floyd song called, appropriately enough, "Careful With That Ax, Eugene" (please don't reply  telling me it's "kill kill ma ma". Manfredini has been claiming that lately, but there's an old Fangoria interview where he mentions the Pink Floyd song as the inspiration.)That being said, the first two movies were serious, well done, and scary (my favorite scene in the first one is the girl in the bathroom after Marcia was killed. The killer is still there hiding behind the shower curtain and you see that hand pulling it back - creepy stuff), and Manfredini's score gave them tremendous atmosphere. As the series progressed, the films got worse, and aside from the occasional success like "Jason Lives" - one of the first slasher parodies that predated "Scream" by over 10 years, and hit-or-miss experiments like "Jason goes to Hell" and "Jason X", most of the sequels were as bad as this new remake.The remake starts off with a misfire - instead of the first 15 minutes recapping the original murders with Mrs. Voorhees, they have Jason as the killer with the cloth mask and only mention the Mrs. Voorhees storyline in the first 2 minutes. They could have easily had the first 15 minutes showing an unseen killer who was revealed as Mrs. Voorhees, and it probably would have thrown some people off, and worked well.The Bay/Nispel theme of slasher films as a morality tale to warn against the evils of pot smoking is here, as it was with their remake of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and the fact that almost every character is depicted as a clueless weed obsessed dolt gets annoying after awhile. Compare the characters in the first two movies with the exaggerated moronic stereotypes in this remake and you'll see the differences immediately.And the gore scenes that practically define a "Friday the 13th" film are bad - one murder even suggests that the person was killed by having their ear cut off - lame. There is a moment where Jason throws an ax that is well done, and another kill that recalls the original series, but a few minutes cannot save this mess.While the original has a classic jump-scare ending (inspired by "Carrie"), the ending to this movie is similar to some of the terrible sequels.And the music. This film has none of Manfredini's strings and only uses the "Chhh chhh haaa haaa" theme a few times, once, strangely enough, when a police officer is approaching a cabin - this actually had me thinking they were going the "Chainsaw" remake route with a police officer helping Jason, but it was just an inept,  misplaced music cue.Some individuals will love this ("it has Jason killing, dude, awesome!"), while others who are more discriminating will smell it for the garbage that it is.

$review_text.: *Warning, may contain minor spoilers* Holy cow...where to start? Ok, we'll start with this one: The 'action' scenes in this movie make your typical 'Rambo' movie look realistic. As in, the movie 'Platoon' realistic. These guys have guns with magazines that hold roughly 113,000 rounds apiece...and if you think I'm exaggerating, just watch it. Just...watch it. And our heroes aren't the brightest bulbs in the package, either. Throughout the entire movie, the ENTIRE movie, they never, ever EVER catch on that a simple head shot will put a zombie down for good. But hey, it will work on a live person! No, instead, they'll get into a fist fight with one (I wish I was making this up), punch it about 5000 times, then, when that doesn't work, will grab their guns and shoot it in the chest about 5000 times, and then, FINALLY, they....whatever, it's not even worth the effort to type. And this one scene near the end of the movie, seriously, this guy was literally surrounded by, like, 500 zombies, out in the OPEN, and managed to fight them off for 10 or 15 minutes (I wish I was making that up, too), even after finally running out of ammo. You know, after he had fired all 113,000 rounds. And all the things I've pointed out, are just the tip of the iceberg. Complete TRASH, avoid at all costs.

$REVIEW.: For my money, when it comes to Blondie, it's all about 1976-1978. These were the years when Debbie & Co. were their most interesting and free in their exploration of their craft. Whoever went digging for vintage footage for Blondie's "Behind the Music" segment did an incredible job. There is lots of 16mm color concert footage from 1977 and 1978 (presumably, much of it from the unreleased John  Cassavettes/Sam Shaw documentary shot in Los Angeles in 1977). There's even a brief video segment on Wind in the Willows! The DVD differs from the program as it aired on television in that the music video segments run longer here, and the music video for the band's comeback single "Maria" is added as a bonus. This is mecca for fans of Blondie.

$REVIEW.: I remember when "My Girl" came out in cinemas. I was in third grade, I was at a new school, and it was the start of a new term. First thing we had to do is get into partners and tell the other person what you'd done over the holidays. I still hadn't made any proper friends yet, so no one really wanted to be my partner. I told the teacher, and he told off the class for not being very friendly. That was embarrassing, but it got me a partner. And what had I done over the holidays? I'd gone and seen "My Girl", so I talked about that...The girl of the film's title is an eleven year old named Vada (Anna Chlumsky), and she's a little strange. Still, that's understandable given the company she's grown up with. Her all too busy father (Dan Aykroyd) runs a funeral parlour in their home, her mother is dead, her grandmother is senile, her best friend Thomas J. (Macaulay Culkin) is allergic to everything, and the other girls in town tease her about her friendship with him. Is it any wonder that Vada is confused about death and love? It is the summer of 1972, a summer where Vada will learn a little, grow up a little, laugh a little, cry a little, sing a little. It'll be a summer she never forgets.This film looks a little older than the early 1990s, and I think that's a little bit deliberate. Might of been a filter, might have been the type of film they used, I don't know. Everything looks a little dusty and old, like a faded photograph at times. It really works well against the scenery, particularly the lake and the trees, rather idyllic. The cast plays nicely against the backdrop, particularly the young actors Macaulay Culkin and Anna Chlumsky. It's a shame Anna hasn't been in anything lately. I wonder what she's doing these days? It's always nice to see a bit of Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis too. The characters they all play are intriguing, especially the way they react to what happens in the story.It's a sad film at times. There's one scene at the funeral parlour where the pastor is quoting a verse from the Bible, the part where Jesus says "let the children come to me", and Vada, really upset runs up to the front. It was heartbreaking and symbolic. I cried just recently watching that bit.When I was a kid, seeing the film for the first time back in third grade, I didn't think Vada's life in a funeral parlour was that strange. Looking back on it, I can see I was a bit like her back then. I was a bit confused about death for a few reasons as well. I'd say it's a good film about coming to terms with death, actually.Definitely worth a look. Good cast, good story, good scenery. Great film.

$review_text.: I have never read any of the `Hellblazer' comics so I had no clue as to who are the characters in the movie before watching it. However, I took that as a good thing, since I had an open mind about this movie, not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised in finding myself liking the movie while I was viewing it.John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), as a child could see demons walking the earth, and was terrified of it. He tried to commit suicide and therefore knows that he will go to hell when he dies. Having seen hell, when he grows up, he decides to help people by removing demons through exorcisms and such. Now we meet Angela (Rachel Weisz), a cop who is trying to find the reason for her twin sister's death. While watching a surveillance video of her sister Isabel before her death, Isabel mentions the name `Constantine'. Therefore, Angela meets Constantine and together, they discover what's really going on, and try to stop it before it's too late.For a debut, director Francis Lawrence did an excellent job on this film. The special effects are amazing (there are so many good ones that I can't pick out any in particular). Keanu Reeves does his usual in this movie as he did in the Matrix. It's not that he didn't act well, but he is playing the same kind of roles lately, it wasn't a big surprise that he could pull this off. Rachel Weisz acted well for her role, as did the rest of the cast. While the movie was good overall, some of the conversations in the movie, especially dealing with religion, were a little hard to follow.In general, this movie is not so bad, and seeing that there are so many pathetic movies releasing these days, this one is worth watching.

$review_text.: The movie is slim on plot, so if you're looking for a movie with the plot depth of "The Silence of The Lambs" you'll be sorely disappointed.The screenwriters are pretty lazy, never having done any research into WW2 (Russian soldiers were Atheists and NEVER would say 'Jesus Christ' in response to anything; most soldier actions & dialogue are cliche).The movie suffers from failing to achieve one of the cardinal rules of horror films:  Frankenstein's Army is never, ever scary.  But it is interesting.The movie itself is brought to you by Richard Raaphorst, a filmmaker who gained a lot of notice on YouTube with his two trailers for the now-defunct zombie movie "Worst Case Scenario," and much like those trailers (CHECK THEM OUT!!!), the monsters are the stars of this flick.  Once the creatures appear - and there are tons of old-school non-CGI creatures in Frankenstein's Army - this is as close to a live-action version of the Quake 2 video game as I've ever seen.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and did so by never taking it too seriously.  I watched it 4 times over the weekend during the 48 hour rental through Vudu and highly recommend it.  It's a fun party flick!

$REVIEW.: I watched this film because of its Oscar nom, despite lulewarm reviews. There is certainly a lot of pathos involved, and I was more reminded of "Dead Poet's Society" than others mentioned in previous reviews. Music is always a terrific reliever of tension. I would like to think that justice was done, if this is, indeed, a true story. There are ugly moments throughout, and a few glorious moments that can make a simple mind like mine think that perfection could really happen, under the circumstances. "Les Choristes" is unrealistic in too many ways, but it's a good story; I wish our troubled children, way too many, could understand the power of music, and realize that the world ain't so bad...Music is INDEED a powerful life entity.

$REVIEW.: Although Ingmar Bergman is justifiably regarded as one of the great filmmakers in film history, this could be his most beautiful and moving film.  It is the story of Professor Isak Borg as he journeys from his home to Lund University to pick up an honorary degree.  Very often in film, a journey can stand for so much more than just a trip from one place to another, and so it is in this movie.  The journey roughly parallels Borg's own life, and plays much the same role in causing Borg to reevaluate his life choices as the three ghosts in Dickens's A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  Like Scrooge, Borg's life is one devoid of the most important human qualities, and like Dickens, Bergman has a happy story to tell.  Although we normally associate Bergman with bleak and despairing themes as found in such films as THE SILENCE or PERSONA or WINTER LIGHT, in this film Bergman holds out hope.  As Borg encounters individuals in his trip and struggles with painful memories of the past, he realizes the emptiness of his life, despite his many accomplishments, and comes at the end to embrace life and find love through rediscovering the bonds with his family members.At the center of the film is the magnificent performance by celebrated Swedish director Victor Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m.  Although not well known outside Scandinavia, Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m was one of the greatest Swedish directors before Bergman.  After he ceased directing, he embarked on a distinguished career as an actor, but this, his final role before his death in 1960, is perhaps his finest role.  Balancing Sj&ouml;str&ouml;m is the remarkably beautiful Bibi Andersson as Sara, the young girl he gives a lift to.  In addition to the wealth of memories that are continually assaulting his psyche, it is the unexpected friendship he finds with Sara that seems to make possibly his redemption at the end of the film.  Bergman regulars, such as Ingrid Thulin, Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand, and Max von Sydow, fill out the rest of the cast.

$review_text.: I'll admit, i'm a sucker for these SNL best of series.  I usually wait awhile to get these for 10 bucks or less, but as was the case with the Will Ferrel/Jimmy Fallon dvd's, paying full price(about 15 bucks) for this right away(released as of 6/7/05) is not a bad thing.  I'm not a huge Jon Lovitz fan, but he did have some very funny bits/characters, and he was always a solid performer that was counted on to help carry the show every week(and he would deliver too).  I'm not here to review or re-cap all the sketches, too lazy for that.  Besides, either you enjoyed Lovitz or you didn't, and some sketches are better than others(we all know every collection is a hit-or-miss affair as to the selection of sketches that made the cut or not); and even with his fans, there will always be debate as to which bits better represented his talents.  So i'll just tell you why this is a particularly good edition in the series.A. it runs about 94 minutes.  some in the series barely break 60 min!  so you're getting a decent dose of quantity here(quality i'll leave up to SNL/Lovitz fans to dissect themselves)B. the extras are plenty, unlike some other bare bones releases in the series.  they include:* audition: good thing i'm not a talent scout, cause i wouldn't have hired Lovitz based on his audition lol.  it's fairly brief, another snl alumni shows up(and does nothing!), and it has a tie-in to the dress rehearsal....* photo gallery: some pics of mr. Lovitz, also fairly brief.* dress rehearsal: a decent sketch(never before seen apparently) that also has Leslie Nielson(Police Squad/Naked Gun fame) in it.  it's a WW2 bit that has some lines you'll recognize from his auditon.* tv appearance: from the Conan O'Brian show, this is pretty good as well. there's only one segment(in its entirety it seems) unfortunatley. i say that only because i've seen him on Conan quite a bit and this isn't the best one. but it does include his usual rants at Conan's expense.* audio commentary: my favorite extra.  having him contribute this track really adds to the enjoyment. listening to him reminisce in the commentary is fun and informative and really adds an extra dimension to the disc.  Highly recommended if you enjoy SNL, Jon Lovitz, this 'best of' series, comedy in general, or good value in your dvd's.

$REVIEW.: Bret Easton Ellis is an awesome writer. I think his book "American Psycho" captures a certain essence of modern America that eludes most authors. It's difficult to say that about a book whose main character spends most of his time killing people in the most nauseating ways possible while working days as a Wall Street insider. Based on that plot summary alone, I would say you'd have to be insane to think "American Psycho" is a modern classic. It is, though. It's how Ellis captures the vacuousness of the elites, the absolute absence of any form of morality, which makes the book shine. Too, he captures the mindlessness of rampant consumerism perfectly. He takes it over the top, I think, but he does so only to emphasize the emptiness of his characters. Not surprisingly, his other novels look at the same ideas from different perspectives. "Less Than Zero" cast a scathing eye on the immoral goings on amongst wealthy 1980s youth in Los Angeles. Then there's "Rules of Attraction," a book, eventually made into a major motion picture in 2002, which does the same thing for wealthy college students. I think I detect a pattern unfolding here!"The Rules of Attraction" exposes the antics unfolding at Camden College, one of those snooty, Ivy League type schools attended by the offspring of America's rich and famous. Let's meet the cast of characters, shall we? We've got Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek), a drug dealer in hot water with his supplier Rupert Guest (Clifton Collins, Jr.). Lauren Hynde (the delightful Shannyn Sossamon) is a pretty young girl saving herself for her boyfriend Victor (Kip Pardue), who in turn is currently making the party rounds in Europe. Lauren's roommate Lara (Jessica Biel) likes to mix it up with the entire male population of Camden College. Paul Denton (Ian Somerhalder) is a chap that likes to swing both ways. He used to date Lauren before coming out of the closet, so to speak, and now has eyes for Sean Bateman, who he thinks swings both ways as well. I think that pretty much covers the main characters. We've got a host of minor actors in the unfolding story arcs--people like Candice (Clare Kramer), Kelly (Kate Bosworth), and Marc (Fred Savage)--to keep things popping. We also see Faye Dunaway and Swoosie Kurtz as parents in a particularly amusing sequence.Whew! Just trying to keep track of the characters takes up most of your first viewing experience. You'll need to watch the film again to get the most out of it, however, because director Roger Avary employs a most unusual narrative technique to tell these characters' stories. When we first enter the movie, Sean's prowling about the infamous "End of the World" party held every year on campus. We hear him talking about himself and his actions in voiceover, a tactic used for other characters as well, before the weirdness begins. Scenes start rewinding at an incredible pace, zipping back through what we've already seen in order to take us to another character's sad tale of woe. We see Sean's problems with Rupert, Lauren's romantic difficulties, and lots of out of control partying. We learn that Sean receives love notes in his post office box that he thinks Lauren sent. The two meet but eventually drift apart before anything serious occurs. That's mainly the crux of the film right there: interesting things start to happen but don't due to inaction, misunderstandings, and a lack of communication. It doesn't help that the characters labor under vacuousness so total as to preclude meaningful relationships with anyone other than themselves.I got a huge kick out of this movie. Then again, I also got a huge kick out of the film versions of "Less Than Zero" and "American Psycho". Others disagree, obviously, but I think Ellis's novels translate well to the screen. "Rules of Attraction" works under the capable guidance of Roger Avery. I think a lot of people complain about this movie, and by extension the other film versions of Ellis's books, because they don't understand the subject matter. You can complain about the film's lack of substance (not substance abuse, though, because there's plenty of that to go around), but that's the point. Ellis writes books that expose the various forms of decadence plaguing our society, and writes them in order to show the consequences on its practitioners. If you can't grasp that concept, you won't like this film. Then again, maybe you will if you like your humor as black as pitch. Let me cite two wickedly funny sequences in the movie as proof. One, the scene in which Sean attempts to take his own life had me howling with laughter. I watched it again and again, and it never lost its ability to amuse. Two, Victor's sojourn through Europe is a sight and sound experience one should not miss. Hilarious. If you still can't groove to the flick, two words: Jessica Biel.You'll find great picture and audio quality on this DVD. Supplements include an intriguing 26 minute "Anatomy of a Scene" that explains how Avary and company pulled off an especially tricky piece of camera work involving Sossamon and Van Der Beek. We also receive trailers and television spots for the film, promotional material, and a commercial for the book. We also get SIX commentary tracks. One of them is a bonus commentary with comedian Carrot Top (?). The rest rely on the various actors and a few crewmembers. SIX COMMENTARY TRACKS! What were they thinking? If you listen to all of them, and I did, you'll spend days working your way through this disc's special features. I like the movie, I'm giving it five stars, and even I don't think I needed to know this much information about the film. What's surprising is that director Roger Avary isn't on a single one of these tracks! Weird. Anyway, enjoy the film. It's a keeper.

This movie may be good to someone who is interested in this kind of stuff but for an 11 year old girl who loves to see the dancing and singing Shirley this comes as quite a disapoitment.I read that this was Temple's favorite movie of hers. While I can't criticize her opinion I think she has done much better. Wee Willie Winkie doesn't even wink! Some ok parts but if you're a Shirley fan you probably would rather stick to doing something else.

$REVIEW.: This film despite it's astronomical box office grosses is an average picture.  It's not a bad picture just not a particularly great one.  What redeems this film is the acting of the principle performances particularly Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.  Depp is one of those rare performers who can appear in an average vehicle and make it seem more than average.  The swagger and comic nuances of his character make it obvious as to why he FINALLY received an Oscar nomination.  Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush also give stand-out performances here.  Orlando Bloom is the only principle actor who does not leave an impression.  It leads one to believe that essentially he's just this month's pretty boy who is fortunate enough to appear in some high-profile films ("Lord of the Rings" trilogy, "Troy).  Why do I say this film is just average?  The story is mundane.  The special effects are nice but if they don't enhance the story, so what?  Basically, "Pirates of the Caribbean" is the flavor of the month.  If you don't believe me, see how this film ranks in the public's subconscious in about five years.  "Titanic", anyone?

$review_text.: There were some truly funny scenes in this movie.  Other scenes drew laughs that were the type that make you feel guilty for laughing.  Other parts of the movie were simply disgusting.  After reading some of the reviews, it is clear that there is no middle ground when it comes to this movie.  Some want to put it on a pedestal as a brilliant political comedy that pokes fun at America, while others simply lambast it.  I am taking the middle road here.  The movie is funny to watch, with some parts that make you cringe and feel uncomfortable even as an innocent observer.The most troubling aspects of this movie dealt with the sheer mean-spiritedness that some of the scenes featured.  For example, a very sweet jewish couple that ran the bed and breakfast.  Whether or not Cohen is Jewish, the way those people were treated showed little class.  If they were part of the joke, I would not be so disgusted; but I don't think they were.The fight between Cohen and his partner in which they were rolling around nude, served no point other than sick shock value.  How that scene, or the bathroom/dinner table scene serves as political commentary is beyond me.  There is no reason to make this movei more than it is.  It is a slapstick, low brow, comedy with some funny scenes and other scenes that are simply gross and geared towards the type of drunken college kids in the R.V. that Borat got drunk with.Three stars.  Not recommended for family viewing at all, but could be perfect for a drunken poker party.

$REVIEW.: Since New Line released their recent re-make of the The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, they finally had the good sense to release Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 on an extra laden DVD.  Undoubtadly the best, and sadly the monst infamous, sequel in the series, this installment finds two college students (Kate Hodge and William Butler) stranded on a Texas backroad being stalked and hacked up by Leatherface and his larger cannibalistic family.  Ever since this film was released, it garnered a lot of criticism and bad press because of it's many attempts just to get an R rating.  Well, here it is in all it's unrated gory glory, but for the life of me I cannot understand how the unrated version never got an R rating; I mean House of 1000 Corpses was gorier than that.  The film also stars a pre-Lord of the Rings Viggo Mortensen as a member of Leatherface's family, and Dawn of the Dead's Ken Foree as a survivalist who is all that stands between the kids and the family.  The DVD includes a documentary on the film, deleted scenes, and a commentary by director Jeff Burr and crew.

What I didn't like about it was the gratuitous rude and uncivil dialogue between the characters which I felt was in poor taste and a very poor example for kids.  I would not show it to my grandkids, as they learn from movies and videos and I would not want them to emulate the attitudes expressed by the characters. There are already too much iresponsible and negative attitudes expressed on TV. I am amazed that Tom Hanks and the other Hollywood actors got involved in this cheap take off on "Ants."  The insects did not even look like insects, but rather grotesque charactures that were unnatural.  Made for a quick profit, not any redeeming value.

$REVIEW.: The bulk of this film, the middle of it, was just too slow for me, hence the so-so and somewhat-generous 3-stars rating
The beginning and endings were very good, especially several scenes in the final half hour


There were several twists concerning Lizabeth Scott's character that kept you guessing.There were other things going for this film, such as Humphrey Bogart's narration

He had a lot of good lines in here, either narrating or talking to others


He and Scott were the stars but some of the supporting players also were great, such as Morris Carnovsky as the tough-guy aide, "Martinelli
" Also, they may not be big names but Charles Cane, William Prince, Marin Miller, Wallace Ford and James Bell all added nice performance here.Yet, with all this going for it, I didn't find the film as involving as it should have been


It too flat in the middle of the film

Perhaps another look someone will change my mind.

$REVIEW.: First, the title of this series is, was and ALWAYS will be (as any true fan knows) HAWAII FIVE-0, with a zero.  The series, and the team, were named after Hawaii being the 50th state.  Hence a five and a zero.  FIVE-O (with the letter O) makes absolutely no sense. Renaming it FIVE-O to differentiate it from the new series is stupid. Both series are named FIVE-0.Second, as others have noted, the collection is not complete without "Bored She Hung Herself."  (There is no actual comma in the title.) Yes, there are legalities preventing it from being released but the episode itself is harmless enough despite its history of allegedly causing a death.  On the other hand, it is not a particulary good episode and the ending is especially stupid so it's no big loss, but for completeness' sake it should be released.Third, yes, the 1997 pilot should be included because it continues the plotline of the original series (even though it somehow brings Chin Ho back to life, but this is not the first time this sort of thing has happened in fiction.) Also I would have liked to have seen the two-part version of the original pilot ("Cocoon") as broadcast by CBS in the spring/summer of 1969. The opening/closing credits and the editing were closer to the first-season episodes rather than a separate movie.Also, the pilot of the new Hawaii Five-0 could have been added to allow viewers to see that if they hadn't already.  Not only could they fit all the pilots (1969 part 1, 1969 part 2, 1997, 2010) on a special pilot DVD disc but it may have encouraged some viewers to buy the new series on DVD as well.

$REVIEW.: Viewed: 9/04, 11/08Rate: 311/08: Cops and Robbersons is supposed to be a funny movie because Chevy Chase is in it
Weirdly, the more movies of Chevy Chase I see lately, the less funny he is

Anyway, back to Cops and Robbersons which is a nice title, the movie is five percent funny but ninety-five percent stupid
Not just stupid stupid, but just stupid

Chevy Chase tries to be funny by acting like an idiot which didn't work for me
Jack Palance ironically keeps the film running because I was waiting for something good from him, but it never did happen

The plot of the movie is tired and oft used, and the most incredible thing about Cops and Robbersons is its incomplete subplots

Obviously, Chevy Chase's character had longed to be a cop, but we audience never get to know why he didn't become one

Then, I had hoped that Jack Palance's character would tell him the hard cold facts of what it is like being a cop but never did
The family shows problems of its own as it couldn't be a family together


So, the why of it never materialized

In short, the film has no depth in anything


As far as comedy goes, there isn't much to say
At least I remember the best about Cops and Robbersons is when Jack Palance says, "I don't mow lawns," and a couple more of "I don't..." lines


I liked Dianne Wiest in the movie, and she has a very pleasant presence that I enjoy very much

All in all, Cops and Robbersons is probably best summarized as a blank stare


Well, it's your lucky day Michael Ritchie because I am brining the rating up for Cops and Robbersons from `2' to `3'.

$REVIEW.: Zack Snyder just hasn't made the same impact on me that he apparently has on the rest of the moviegoing population

I enjoy his work, but it always seems like there's something to be desired when his films finally fade to black
With Sucker Punch, Snyder isn't really looking to change the formula his films have become notorious for, but the storyline just didn't sit right with me

We know ahead of time that this is all taking place in Baby Doll's head? That's like knowing ahead of time that Teddy Daniels is patient 67 in Shutter Island

Oh wait, we kind of did and that still turned out pretty great
Sucker Punch is fairly disappointing on one hand, but mostly just incredibly entertaining on the other.The Zack Snyder formula mentioned usually just involves heavy use of slow motion while most of his films have a particular look to them like they're all sent through the same filter before reaching the screen while also feeling like they all taking place in the same universe

Snyder became notorious for his R-Rated films, but then broke that mold with Legend of the Guardians
Sucker Punch is Snyder's first PG-13 film, so don't expect a lot of gratuitous gore, endless strings of profanity or graphic sex scenes on spaceships that last an incredibly long time since there's none of that

If you're a fan of any of Snyder's work, Sucker Punch still hits all the same buttons that films like 300 and Watchmen did; the action sequences are still insane and the slow motion technique is used in a way that adds a bit of gusto to each scene it's used in
When the girls first arrive on the train and they're in the middle of trying to retrieve a kitchen knife, a gun is fired as we see the bullet bounce off and shatter a robot's head


The shell then flies by the screen as we hear the air in the room howl through the shell before it falls to the ground

So if you're a doubter of the PG-13 rating, it doesn't really affect much here.This film is like a man's action movie fantasy
It's like Sucker Punch tries to roll everything a guy would enjoy in a film like hot women, heavy gunfire, a mother dragon who basically makes explosions come to her, and enough insanity injected into its most adrenaline racing scenes to keep you talking around the water cooler for hours

It's like trying to combine Showgirls, the Dawn of the Dead remake, Dead Snow, The Lord of the Rings, and I, Robot into one movie
During that same train sequence, I could've sworn the score suddenly paid homage to Terminator 2


Sucker Punch makes sure to tickle all of the brain cells in your head that are still attached to action films from your past.While the film's charm mostly comes from its action scenes and the films they pay tribute to, the flaws in Sucker Punch aren't exactly minimal
The main one being that the film's constant use of music with vocals makes Sucker Punch feel like the director's cut of an extended music video


There are three songs used practically in full in the first thirty to forty five minutes of the film among countless others as the film progresses
The film also takes place within two layers of the mind in addition to what's actually happening in reality, which makes the film feel like a less complicated version of Inception


The plan that Baby Doll comes up with seems a little too grandiose for its own good with such little payoff at times
Do you really have to dance to go to another reality where you're fighting robots on a train while trying to disarm a bomb before it explodes all for nothing more than a kitchen knife? It honestly just felt like a group of guys got together and threw all their favorite action movies into a pot and created a film with an amazing looking incoherent film before coming back around and adding a story to it to try and make everything have some sort of meaning.At the end of the day, Sucker Punch is basically just a glorified music video with really spectacular eye candy


The film can also be considered a fanboy's wet dream
If you're a guy, Sucker Punch is practically guaranteed to at least touch upon at least one of the things you look for and love in an action film
Whether it's giant samurai warriors wielding Gatling guns, steam powered zombie soldiers, hideous orcs and fire breathing dragons, an overbearing clan of bloodthirsty robots, or the fact that you just like to watch scantily clad, young women annihilate their enemies with nothing more than a blade and an endless supply of bullets, Zack Snyder's latest probably has you covered
Sucker Punch may not be the best written film of the year, but it's an action film that can still be considered a hell of a lot of brainless fun.

$review_text.: If someone had thrown $20 million at Ed Wood ("Plan 9 From Outer Space") and said, "Go make a movie about the  battle of Midway", this is what you would have gotten
 Or something pretty darn close.What's not to like about this movie, which sets out to depict the "Miracle of Midway," the carrier battle that turned the tide of the Pacific War?  And was one of the first to use big-sound woofers brought in special into theaters?  (Whump


 Whump.)  As it turns out, lots.1
 The Americans

 Charlton 'Moses' Heston gets to play a square-jawed naval commander and reprise his role in dozens of movies from "Omega Man" and "Planet of the Apes", being the stern hero type, able to both command, and in a pinch when the Americans are running low on pilots (hm..
don't remember this in the books) actually jumping into a plane and leading the charge
 Hal Holbrook was great as Mark Twain but his "Jim Dandy" intelligence officer demeanor is annoying here

 Henry Fonda is in his "Asteroid" cipher mode.2
 Artificially Embedded Love Interest or AELI  (see "Pearl Harbor" as a reference point)

 Thankfully instead of Pearl Harbor's indeterminable two hours of dreck we only get about fifteen minutes or so of the duet of Heston's pouty-lipped aviator son and his Japanese-American fiancee


 When Heston upbraids his son as being a complete chowderhead for considering marrying this woman, my reaction was, 'yeah, right.'  She looks like a million dollars but talks like a Brooklyn Dodger, which leads me to...3

 The Japanese
 Where did they find these kanaka boys?  It?s a bit of a cold bath to see all these healthy corn-fed Japanese youth when  they open their mouths and..
they sound just like the staff at the Malibu Surf Shop


 Holy cow

 Japanese icon Toshiro Mifune is here, but they force him to speak English and goggle at all of the surf shop staff.4


 Stock war footage

 Like Ed Wood, the producers of this movie love stock wartime footage, 'cause it's free


 Color, switch to black and white, back to color..
 But Midway (except for the Wake Island bombing) produced little stock, and certainly none survive of the first attacks by flights like Waldron's torpedo squadron, which was wiped out
 The planes don't match


 Particularly bad are stock scenes of Japanese planes diving into American carriers


 No such kamakaze attacks occurred during Midway


 Midway was fought by first-string veterans of Pearl Harbor and they didn't go in for this sort of stuff.5

 Special effects
 The non-stock footage, apart from the pretty good large scale model work of the Japanese carriers (which is probably Toho stuff) is cheesy
 It all looks like actors on a grey cardboard soundstage, and we get to see the same explosions over and over again
 This movie could just as easily been done in 1945


 Maybe it was.So..

 "Midway" is an OK kiddie film for ages 18 months and up, very little blood, no sex please, we're the Navy, and the sailors don't talk like sailors - especially Hal ("hot jiminy") Holbrook
 Otherwise, go out for sushi instead


 Maybe join the NRA.

$review_text.: I was impressed (and terrified) by the first Terminator. It was a groundbreaking movie that taught us a very powerful lesson... don't give robots and computer networks autonomy. It was well scripted and acted, with some now famous lines.T2 picked up pretty well from there and introduced a more advanced robotic threat (that physically makes no sense, liquid metal?) but showed very interesting special effects. What saved that film for me was the juxtaposition of Arnold's T1 character from executioner to bodyguard and savior. It is interesting to take the villain from one movie and make him a hero in the next. When he died, I felt sad.But along comes T3 and I have to say: HUH?We have a new robot, a girl terminatrix, who is a cute, perky blonde with the worst attitude imaginable. Why is she wearing stiletto heels? Wouldn't a killer robot go for running shoes? At least she's wearing a pants suit and not a granny dress -- though that would have been hysterical!At first she's seems to be another T2 liquid metal machine, but it turns out, she's even more, and more illogical than is fair to ask us to believe because she doesn't use her machine powers the way a machine would -- and that is efficiently!Okay, so first she has these hand guns (really, her hand becomes a machine gun and don't ask me where she's keeping the bullets) to shoot anyone, including the T1. Only the T1 is sort of immune to bullets (this has been well established in the first two movies) So why bother with the dang gun that won't do anything when fighting him -- and why does he incessantly shoot back. Oh, these must be WINDOWS machines! (sorry, Microsoft). Okay seriously, they do it because they think the audience likes to see guns firing and gets a thrill out of things shooting other things with absolutely no results except to innocent bystanders, who get splattered all over the place!Well, the gun jams or something, so the terminatrix (who is beginning to make me remember dumb blonde jokes) goes for the next super weapon, a flame thrower! At this point I am having flash backs to computer shoot-em-ups where the player can pick from an arsenal of weapons... real original concept there. I guess she wants to burn off Arnold's flesh - which works as a gross out device in the movie, but makes no sense in dealing with a titanium (or even stronger) machine!Why doesn't she have a welding torch as a weapon? She could WELD Arnold to a fence or something like that (ow, that would hurt). Or what about the old tried-and-true spinning saw-blades-of-death? That's been around since the 1920's and even an episode of Doctor Who went with those!Why does she need weapons, or pants suits or any of this stuff when with a little help from the script writers, she could have used the greatest weapon of all -- a BRAIN! Let's think here...She has a mission - to kill a bunch of people, including John Connor. She has the remarkable ability to remote control other machines through networking and nanobots but doesn't use that ability to kill her victims in their own homes -- with their own devices! Aren't machines supposed to be efficient? A self propelled killer vacuum cleaner can be pretty scary.Yeah it may seem strange, but it could have made a terrifying movie. People being stalked by remote controlled killer appliances! And she could have been the mastermind of it all, sitting in a office tower watching on her laptop through security cams, as victim after victim screams and dies a tortuous death while she laughs at their suffering. Okay I think we have had some movies like this before, but with a perky blonde robot-from-the-future as the villain? I think NOT. Now THAT would have been a villain! But then we'd miss out on all those impossible-to-believe car chase and destruction scenes.There is a pretty well documented branch of science called physics. The filmmakers seemed to have thrown that out the window. When the terminatrix is driving the HUGE yellow crane truck at what seems like 60 MPH no less (yeah these things can sustain that speed for a long time) she swings the arm/boom sideways to wipe out all sorts of stuff (including annoying traffic lights) and the truck doesn't even lurch with the shift in weight! Oh, and it doesn't break down! Uh, most of the stuff we make today does break down if we slam it into a building, it really does.Okay, the whole scene is for the chase, not logic but come on, give me something I can believe! Let's at least give a passing nod to reality!I also missed the part explaining why the terminatrix took so long to overtake the T1's inferior CPU. I mean, she got police cars to drive by themselves in no time -- even where there is no actual mechanical way to remote control the steering or gas pedal -- no motors on those things-- right? Or is it the nanobots doing it all, and HOW is she able to control them so well when she is kind of busy driving that crane truck at 60 mph with the boom being sideways and Arnold stuck to the end of it? Come on guys, a little common sense here, please? I know these future machines are ultra-sophisticated, but I don't think even Superman has that level of concentration or multitasking ability!What was good about the film was of course seeing Arnold again. But he didn't have too many 'Arnold moments'. It seemed like they couldn't figure out what to do with him and relied on what we knew from the first two films. There IS an interesting reveal when the T1 explains who sent him back this time and why. It would have been far more moving if the script writers had made John Connor and the T1 develop a much stronger bond, as they had in T2. I would have liked to see a development along those lines. They had the time to do it, but they missed it. And finally, the ending has a sort of unexpected twist, I'll grant it that, but before we get there we have to watch T1 and T3 in a truly brutal "duke it out" in a bathroom.Unfortunately most of the film focuses too much on explosion after explosion (is the fireworks industry funding Hollywood these days?) and relentless destruction with some gruesomeness (Arnold cutting himself up to get to different machine parts, for example).SummaryThis movie missed the boat.It could have been so much more, and really moving and clever.Well, it moves alright, from one explosion to the next, one useless spray of bullets to the next. Here's the problem. After a while this stuff is just annoying!As it is, watch the movie for the explosions and the vast destruction of property (if you like that sort of thing). Wait a long time for the two or three very brief shining moments in the film. Get the surprise ending and say, "Ooh, I get it!".Then sigh and go do something else.Whatever you do, don't try to fit logic into it. It has so little, it is a shame.

$review_text.: So I was listening to the awesome hip-hop song "Villuminati by J. Cole for like the 10th time, and when the above lyric played, memories of this movie suddenly came flooding back and I wanted to see if I could find it!My first introduction to this film came when I found a used VHS copy of it at a video rental store's liquidation sale.  At the time I had just bought one of those new-fangled DVD player devices, but I still had my VCR, so I enjoyed finding tapes for free or practically free.  The cover and back summary of the tape sleeve dealt with witches, one of my favorite supernatural movie subjects, and in particular it looked like a lower budget version of "The Craft" (complete with a picture of star Sheeri Rapapport looking exactly like Fairuza Bulk!).  So I thought, hey, for a dollar, it's worth checking out!  I really liked this one, so much so that I was sad when my VCR finally went and I had to get rid of it!"Little Witches" opens with an interesting scene of nude and semi-nude female witches conducting a ritual using mirrors, knives, grotesque animal masks and strategically-placed foliage.  They are interrupted by mysterious, black-robed figures.  The scene shifts, and we soon learn that what we have seen was a failed attempt by the fabled and infamous Illuminati, an 1890s witch coven that, while students at an all-girls California Catholic boarding school, had tried to raise a bloodthirsty demon.A century later, at the same Catholic school, a group of six fun-loving girls are left by their parents for various reasons to spend Easter break at the school.  Within the group are two very different girls, the studious, shy and innocent Faith, and the rebellious, smart-aleck bad girl Jamie, who quickly becomes the group's leader. Assigned to teen-sitting duties is the young, beautiful and kind nun Sister Sherilyn, and she has her hands full with these girls. Left largely to their own devices, the girls spend their days flirting with and fantasizing about the onsite construction crew, goofing off and scheming various hijinks like stealing and drinking the chapel wine.  After the construction crew discovers the Illuminati's ritual cave- complete with corpses - beneath the chapel itself, the girls' curiosity is piqued and they become light-heartedly fixated on the 19th-century witch coven.  When the black magic they cast begins to work and things get all dark and creepy, Faith wants out, but Jamie's hunger for power gets stronger, and she pushes the other girls into forming a new coven and raising that previously forgotten demon.As previously stated, I am a big fan of witches in popular fiction.  Though I love and respect Wiccans and Pagans, and know that true magical practice is a peaceful and beautiful religion, popular culture depictions of witches are just plain fun!  I've seen so many: "The Craft," "Hocus Pocus," "Black Candles," "The Lords of Salem," "Sabrina the Teenage Witch," "Bell, Book and Candle," you name it, I've seen it, and probably own it!  That being said, this one is not half bad.  It's definitely a B movie, with the requisite B-grade acting (with the exception of Sheeri Rappaport), effects, writing and plot development.  However, it's done well and though not perfect, is very entertaining. It utilizes shadows and slanted camera angles a lot, and I actually liked the effect.It does contain some random nudity (though no actual sex), especially by Sheeri Rappaport, who is the film's most frequently disrobed (literally like 5 times), but also the film's best actor.  How rare is that? :-) I mean, she's a delight to watch, a talented and funny actress with a very natural delivery.  There are no 4-letter words in this movie, though there is a little tiny bit of sexually suggestive dialogue.As far as special effects go, yeah, as stated, they're not the best.  We get a very puppet-looking demon, a zombie, black blood that oozes out of walls and statues, some objects that fly through the air by themselves, and yeah that's about it.Of note: We have the appearance of Zelda Rubinstein, most famously of "Poltergeist," as the mysterious and feared Mother Clodah.  Also, we get the gorgeous Jennifer Rubin as Sister Sherilyn.  If you love horror movies like I do, you will recognize her as Taryn in "A Nightmare on Elm Street 3:  The Dream Warriors" ("In my dreams, I'm beautiful...and BAD!":-) It's so funny that one of Sister Sherilyn's pep-talk lines to the girls is "I know what you're going through.  It was not so long ago that I was in your shoes!", when not even 10 years prior she played a troubled, rebellious teenager herself...though she was up against Freddy Krueger, who's a heck of a lot scarier than the animatronic demon in this movie! :-)So, if you like diabolical, heretical witches running amok of the establishment, and especially if you're an Amazon Prime member and can see this for free, check it out!  I find it highly entertaining, and I'm glad I've been reunited with it after many years.  :-)
$SUMMARY.: "I'm 'Bout to Go and Join the Illuminati, 'F' Everybody"  :-)

$review_text.: Our family loves Veggie Tales, we own them all.  I had high hopes for "Pistachio," as I do all of them; maybe the fact that Pistachio is my favorite ice cream made me excited for this release.  It's cute, don't get me wrong.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the lesson about obeying your parents, that they want to do what's best for you.  The character names, songs, ducks, Blue Berry (hilarious)...all of that was clever and hilarioous.  However, I just wish they hadn't done a "Disney" adaptation.  The reason we won't let our kids watch Pinocchio is because of the fox and carnival scenes.  Of coure, Pistachio isn't even half as bad, but I still didn't like the scheming and lying parts.  yes, kids will have to deal with them someday, but our 2 to 5-year olds don't quite get that there are people like that in the world.  I answer questions for them and we talk about what God wants us to do, that some people care only about money or other things and that we need to pray for them, etc.  Still, though it isn't our favorite Veggie Tales movie (Ballad of Little Joe, Moe and the Big Exit, Noah's Umbrella, Esther, Joshua and the Big Wall...they are our favorites), it teaches an invaluable lesson.  While our kids never choose it out of our collection, it's one I'm happy to put on in the van's DVD player for our 1+ hour trips.  The songs, as always, are catchy and witty.  It's definitely worth seeing, especially if you're a Veggie Tales fan.  5 stars for the lessons, 3 stars for presentation, 4 stars overall!

$review_text.: A classic thriller from a time when paganism and pastoral folk music were both relatively trendy in the UK (both Jethro Tull and Steeleye Span were big at this time), this is one of a handful of decent, low-budget  independent British films. Furthermore, it has very little to do with the  increasingly-camp series of Hammer Horror movies - it isn't even 'horror',  really. It's a strange and unsettling semi-horror, semi-thriller,  semi-pagan movie that was shamefully cut to shreds before release (with the  original film cans being dumped in a ditch opposite the M1), and is long  overdue for some kind of video release. The plot concerns a investigating  into the disappearance of a young girl on a remote Scottish island,  although that is quickly forgotten as our hero, policeman Edward Woodward,  discovers that the island has rejected conventional Christianity for  paganism. From then on it's strange and jarring, as our hero first attempts  to solve the mystery and then escape and get help. Almost a British version  of the standard Hollywood 'You ain't from around these parts' redneck  horrors of the seventies (such as 'The Hills Have Eyes' and 'Deliverance'),  it builds up to an unforgettable, extraordinary ending which I wasn't  expecting the first time I saw the film. Apart from Woodward, the cast is  very 'mid-70's British low-budget horror' - Christopher Lee is resplendent  with enormous hair, and Britt Ekland allows her body double to appear nude  (from the back). Legend had it that Rod Stewart, her then-boyfriend, tried  to have the film withdrawn from release, but like so many legends this was  completely untrue.

$review_text.: I do like the show....the premise of sliding between worlds is a novel concept as long as you can pull it off. One thing the series fails to do is maximize what they had here.....they had the chance to bring back some more older characters from the other seasons. Remember Quinn's alter female self and how she is now going randomly through wormholes like the cast are? Where did she wind up? and why didn't they make an episode about their next run in? How about....meeting more duplicate sliders that have Wade and Arturo back again? That would have generated more ratings!!!! (unlike the episode where they run into 3 of the 4 characters...Remmie as the scientist..Maggie as a "dancer" and Quinn as.......YEAH...not worth mentioning because it was dumb).  I guess these ideas were lost on the writers...and we got stuck with a "Chasm" episode and two awful ones from season three....(YOU know which ones).....The characters had not much time to really develop as they were constantly trying to either find a way off the world, or trying to find each other again. Quinn, who for some strange reason, never let his relationship with Wade really blossom, decided to do the same with Maggie. For a few episodes, they showed some spark, but...at the next episode...IT'S GONE!!!!!I heard about the fight after the third season concerning the Maggie/Wade characters. If I was the director,I wouldn't have picked one or another...I would have said for them to work it out or both would be cut!!!But, I guess we will never see the two characters again (even though they helped make the series), no more laughing at Arturo call someone a "blistering Idiot"....or an episode with Wade actually escaping from the breeding camp. I would have loved to see what her fate was....but NOOOO!!  THANK YOU WRITERS!!!Now, I hear that the Quinn brothers left...got "caught" on a vortex or something and we now have 3 new sliders??  The Quinns helped shape the series and I have heard some bad things about the fifth season. I don't know if its worth getting.....As with any good series, you need to TIE UP SOME STORY ARCS!!!  They didn't here...what started out with good promise with the first ever episode....ended in disgrace.....maybe one day, someone can utilize the full potential of this series....

$review_text.: Every once in awhile I like to watch a David Cronenberg film. I have seen several at this point, from his earliest stuff like "Rabid" to his seminal reworking of "The Fly" starring Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. One thing you will always get from a Cronenberg film is a serious look at how technology and human beings interact. Like science fiction author J.G. Ballard, Cronenberg's films embrace a synthesis of man and machine that is exceedingly grim, an outlook usually complimented with generous helpings of gore. The overarching theme in his cinematic examinations seems to be that humans simply do not know enough about the technology they develop, or if they do, their arrogance in the ultimate abilities of mankind always leads them charging into experiments despite the risks. That we are just not far seeing enough to predict the outcome of using new drugs or messing around with human genetics may be a good message to take from a Cronenberg film. "Shivers" is Cronenberg's first major motion picture, and it is quite an auspicious beginning for the Canadian director. This film isn't great, not compared to some of Cronenberg's later magnum opuses, but it showed just enough promise to merit attention from Hollywood.It's the wonderful 1970s in "Shivers," a time when fancy high-rise residences went up offering prospective tenants all the amenities. The Starliner, an apartment building situated on an isolated island somewhere in Canada, is one of these luxurious projects. The building offers everything for modern living--including a parasite that turns people into raving sex maniacs. Yep, you heard right. "Shivers" is about a bunch of poor souls undergoing painful invasions from nasty looking creatures that feed off their host in particularly vicious ways. The problem starts when a quack seeking funding for a radical new medical procedure experiments with the idea of replacing failed organs with an engineered parasite that will take over a particular organ's function. He introduces his repulsive creation into the body of a young girl living in the Starliner with the intention of monitoring how well his idea works, but things quickly go awry. It turns out that this young lady is quite popular with many of the male residents in the building, leading to the rapid spread of the parasite. At first nothing much happens to those people infected with the bug. There might be a fit or two of coughing, a general lethargy might set in, but after a few hours the psychoses set in. When it does, it is already much too late to stop the nightmare from spreading through the Starliner. Women, men, children--no one is immune from the horrific effects of this parasite.The hero of "Shivers" is the physician at the Starliner, a man with little idea of the horrors he will soon combat as the parasite infects his patients. Aided by his loyal nurse (played by Lynn Lowry), the doctor soon finds himself hunted down by the insane residents as the late stages of the infection set in. The best plan of action is to get out of the building, which isn't as easy as it sounds since the Starliner purposely set out to provide an isolated atmosphere for its tenants. Throw in packs of ravenous loonies prowling the vast corridors of the building looking for fresh meat, and you can see the complications inherent in a run for freedom. The doctor must shoot and bludgeon to death several of his former patients just to stay alive for a few more minutes. As his panic grows, as his movements through the madhouse become increasingly erratic, he witnesses one nightmare after another. His nurse falls prey to the parasite, he sees children panting and crawling about like dogs, and he encounters a father and daughter in a mind-shattering situation. The conclusion to the film is what you would expect from a Cronenberg film--bleak, with little hope for a positive outcome.You can tell "Shivers" is low budget fare, but Cronenberg uses what he has to great effect. The central idea of the film, that modern people seeking isolation from the larger population will fall flat on their faces, works because it doesn't require big budget set pieces. Heck, the director didn't even need big stars. Joe Silver, who did a turn in the director's next film appears here as a doctor on the outside who learns about the infection and pays a bloody price for his knowledge. Barbara Steele plays a small part as a single woman named Betts. The rest of the cast is unfamiliar but effective. Sure, some of the effects are slightly cheesy, the editing isn't all that great, but this movie stays with you. You can almost hear some Hollywood big shot saying to Cronenberg after watching the film, "Yeah, this part could have been better. Yeah, you should have done this instead of that. But kid, you got promise and we're going to keep an eye on you." Let's be thankful someone gave Cronenberg a chance to follow up on "Shivers."I thought the DVD edition of the film was good. There's a twenty-one minute interview with Cronenberg where the director talks about his film experiences. I thought he came off as funny and self-effacing, explaining how he knew almost nothing about what a director did on a bigger budget film, how he had to help an actress prepare for crying scenes by slapping her face, and his experiences with Barbara Steele. His recollections concerning his panic over getting shots right should reassure beginning filmmakers that the only way to improve as a director is to dive right in. This interview serves as a sort of mini-commentary for the film and I appreciated its inclusion on the disc. Give "Shivers" a shot if you like horror movies.

Like all the other Mill Creek packs, this was as inexpensive as a cheap cup of coffee or cheap piece of candy. In this collection you get lots of big name as well as obscure name actors like John Wayne, Tex Ritter, Ken Maynard and many others. In these movies you get masked robbers, evil land barons, crooked politicians, ladies in distress, and loyal deputies and other side-kick characters. This has most of the big name western stars before they were big stars. Actors such as, John wayne and Randolph Scott in their younger days as they were just growing to legendary status. Also, you can find a lot of movies with Hoot Gibson as some kind of side-kick in one form or another. This set even has lots of Spaghetti westerns in it. And just as I have warned before, this is pretty much all old movies with the majority of them in black and white and aren't the HD Blu-Ray modern movies of today. So, keep that in mind and you should be in western movie heaven with this set. So sit back and enjoy the ride into the sunset of western movie bliss.

$review_text.: A classic movie about an insane asylum. A new nurse comes to work at the asylum, but moments before she arrives, a tragic event happens. The 'judge' chops up the only doctor with an ax! Another patient, an older female, who was allowed to act and dress up like a doctor welcomes the new nurse.What a range of characters we have here. There's 'Sergeant' who is a Vietnam shell-shock victim who stands firewatch every night and watches for 'incoming' outside his window.Ben, a giant black man who has the mentality of an 8 year old after a botched lobotomy.Another chick who treats a doll like a real baby.A tormenting and ugly red-haired white dude with a huge fro. His only lines are shrieking and laughing.The 'Judge' who has clearly lost his mind and is in tune with nothing but the court he runs within his mind.A disturbed young girl who falls in love with any man who pays (or doesn't pay) her the slightest attention.The hot nurse who is a bit skinny but looks a lot like Cheryl Ladd.The most disturbing scenes are the mass murder of the patients by Ben, and the nympho in bed with the murdered telephone repairman.Not a movie to watch steadily on a heavy rotation, but fun every now and then.

Eventually he's torn between three very different hunks vying for his affections.Not as good as it sounds.This is typical of every other formulaic gay romantic comedy of the last ten years


Like Jeffrey, Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss and The Broken Hearts Club, the characters in this film don't seem to have anything on their minds but their own gayness

They obsess on being gay
All the jokes are about being gay

All the cultural references are gay

All the locales are gay


All the careers are gay
Based on the comic strip of the same name, this is a mere trifle of a film

It'll pass the time and maybe give you an odd chuckle here or there, but ultimately it's very forgettable.It's fairly competently acted and moves at a swift pace, but I felt as if I'd seen it all before

There's even, not one, but two (!) witty and wise old trannies

Only in modern gay Hollywood does the simple act of donning a dress automatically make a man wise

Howard fan, I've always found some very good and very bad things about this movie.Among the bad things:  First, Thulsa Doom was a skull-faced villian of Conan pre-cursor King Kull.  Why they decided to use him as Conan's nemesis still escapes me other than the fact that maybe the name sounded cool.Second, I really really hated Thulsa Doom as some sort of pre-civilization leader of a cult of hippy flower children.  And beyond that James Earl Jones just seemed totally out of place in that role.Third, REH wrote many great Conan tales.  While the movie borrowed elements from some of his stories such as "The Thing in the Crypt" and "A Witch Shall be Born", I would have preferred them to use a straight Howard story, perhaps extended to fill a movie.  Many of the tales of Conans youth could have been woven together for one larger tale.On the good side, Arnold does look good as Conan, even if he is a bit wooden in the acting department.  The movie does a great job of capturing the look and brutality of the Hyborian age and the fighting scenes were all well-done.I'm greatly looking forward to getting this special edition.

$REVIEW.: STORY:Her son dies, her marriage is failing and she goes off to the country-side to write in seclusion and get a hold on life
But this only sets the stage for what appears on the surface as only a ghost story to follow.MY FEEDBACK:Many reviewers keep saying this is her best role
Well, she's good and the movie shows she is more than a hard-body as were the highlights in GI-Jane and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle


But come on, what happened to her role in St

Elmo's Fire?!? That is in my opinion her best role, but then I'm a bit nostalgic and I was more impressionable when I was a teenager watching that film.All the rest of actors were also good, though we spend 98% of the movie focused on Demi, we don't get to see a range of acting from the rest of the cast.Scenery made you want to go there and bask in the locale's beauty.Mystery was good with some twists and turns, leaving a movie that is more than just a ghost story.Some of the dramatic scenes that should leave me crying were somehow missing some element I'm unable to put my finger on

I don't know if it was the acting, direction, or script


But it was ok, but not the pulling on the heart strings you'd expect

I think it lacked in the screenplay

The script could have done more with playing on the protagonist's sense of if she is going crazy or not
This would have drawn us into more empathy with the character and the loss of her son.My wife didn't like the movie as much because of the supernatural theme


It seems like such a trend now that so many movies have to focus on something beyond "normal" life, when normal life has enough drama in and of itself
Why are so many movies lately focused on the supernatural or super-heroes?  She is just getting tired of it, and part of me doesn't blame her since here is another movie to chalk up to the Dragonfly's, Sixth Sense, Stir of Echos, etc.But 



.if you don't mind or actually prefer the extra bit of supernatural thrown in then you'll probably like this movie even more.OVERALL:It is an entertaining movie, not a bad movie in any sense


I was actually pleasantly surprised


I agree with some of the reviewers that this could have done pretty well at the box office
Its defintily worth a rental!

$REVIEW.: When I saw this film at the theatre, I really didn't enjoy it because I couldn't understand what the actors were saying (they speak too softly at critical points in the plot -- honestly, I think I may be going deaf!), and so some of the characters' motivations were unclear to me.  But because I love the "Iron Man" and "Avengers" stories, I bought the movie and the subtitles brought better understanding, and a much-improved appreciation of the film.  I didn't buy the two-disk version because I don't care THAT much about how the film was made.  This was good enough for me!

$review_text.: Misery is an exceedingly good adaptation of the original novel by Stephen King.  The novel features one of King's most tightly-wound, increasingly suspenseful tales, and this movie faithfully brings the novel to life on the big screen.  Paul Sheldon, America's best selling writer, creator of Misery Chastain and chronicler of her romantic and human struggles and successes, has just finished writing a "serious" novel he hopes will give him the stature he desires.  On his trip home with the manuscript, a fierce blizzard causes him to lose control of his car.  Annie Wilkes, his number one fan, finds his car at the bottom of a hill, pulls Sheldon out of it, and takes him home to nurse back to health.  As Sheldon begins to adjust to his new surroundings, he is increasingly bothered by his caregiver's erratic mood swings.  He soon finds himself a virtual prisoner in her house, essentially unable to move with his two mangled legs.  When Annie reads his brand new book, she is exceedingly unhappy with it.  When she gets the newly published Misery Chastain novel and finds out that her beloved Misty is dead, she begins unleashing her fury on Sheldon and insisting he resurrect Misty in a new novel written especially for her.  All this time, the small mountain town's husband-and-wife police force search for any sign of the missing author (albeit halfheartedly).  Eventually, Sheldon realizes escape is something only he can achieve for himself.James Caan is quite good as Paul Sheldon, but Kathy Bates simply is Annie Wilkes.  Her performance as this complicated, mentally disturbed super-fan broods over this entire movie, making it the riveting thriller it is.  Lauren Bacall, in what is an overlooked but rather amazing casting coup, lends her talents to the movie in the role of Sheldon's literary agent, while Richard Farnsworth and perennial King favorite Frances Sternhagen round out a truly excellent cast.  King actually held out on this project until such time as it could be placed in the more than capable hands of director Rob Reiner.  King had a special affection for this particular story, and he was not going to allow a second-rate adaptation of it to come to the big screen.The suspense of this story is basically psychological in nature, but there are two scenes of far more physical suffering.  The hobbling scene is memorable to say the least, and another incident toward the end introduces a little blood to the film, but overall this is a movie that all lovers of suspense and human drama can appreciate.  There are a lot of bad movies based on terrific Stephen King stories and novels, but this movie captures the powerful magic of the original novel as effectively as any King movie ever has.

$review_text.: No, not die laughing

I have recently "re-discovered" the original movie starring Katharine Ross and I have heard about the scathing reviews and reactions from critics and moviegoers about the remake.The remake was done as a comedy and with an ensemble cast with Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Glenn Close, and Christopher Walken, how can you go wrong? Maybe the movie is not as bad it was made out to be? Perhaps everybody is so in love with the original Katharine Ross classic that they are unfairly comparing the remake and the original.So I watched this movie with an open mind and it started promisingly enough, Nicole Kidman plays the Katharine Ross character, in name only

She doesn't take pictures anymore but here she seems to have a knack of creating reality shows specializing in the emasculation and humiliation of the male gender


When one of her "victims" on these shows went ballistic in public, Kidman's character was fired from the resultant fallout and as damage control.She and her mild house husband packed up and leave for the quaint town of Stepford and that is when everything in the movie just went down hill.Filmed as a comedy, The Stepford Wives just isn't that funny, despite that fact that they included a gay couple - a straight acting Republican and his flamboyant flaming significant other


There are no classic lines delivery like "I'd just die if I don't get that recipe!"


In fact I did not find the jokes funny at all


Perhaps it's the lack of comic timing and the delivery


The scene where the wives are singing Christmas songs and the camera panning over to see Bette Midler sitting idly nearby wearing reindeer antler just isn't that clever, or funny, or even obnoxious.In any case, as a lot of the reviwer pointed out, there is a huge plot hole here


The wives have been addressed by various characters as being robots, is it literally or figuratively speaking? Because it seems the film decided to change the plot halfway in.And speaking of plot changing, this is another thing that I dislike this movie


I lamented that movie nowadays explained everything to you and force feed the audience
The Stepford Wives takes the cake when Matthew Broderick stumbled upon a film featuring Christopher Walken explaining away how the wives are transformed via cyberbetic implants into their brains (a la the Borgs)

I got the feeling this was filmed after major revisions was done to the script and was shoehorned into the film

And in the end, the real villain of the piece is revealed and she, too, gave a long rambling speech about who, how and why was she trying to convert people into "robots".In the end, I was so disgusted and disappointed with this movie that I didn't even bother checking out the extras, which I heard included a deleted scene where Bette Midler became a anthropomorphic vaccum cleaner.The Stepford Wives had the potential to be a very funny film, but somehow the execution failed in a major catastrophic way, squandering the talents of the ensemble cast


I am quite surprised that a sizable number of reviewers would dare to give this movie a four or five stars rating
I suspect the IQ level of America is dropping and this is a definite sign

I always thought that the movie studios underestimates the public and insults our intelligence by endlessly churning out junk, but I have no idea that people like to have their intelligence insulted.

$review_text.: As it started in 1928, this film did an excellent job of recreating an era reminiscent of our parents' and/or grandparents' time
 It was the good old days of model-T fords, switchboard operators, and steel wheel roller skates in a time when role models were structured, the air was purer, and life was sweeter
 Unfortunately, it was also a time before nation-wide Amber alerts, a time when shock treatment was standard for psychiatric patients, and when authority went basically unopposed.This was the setting of Angelina Jolie's surroundings in what was a well-deserved academy award nominated performance of the real life Christine Collins, a woman whom the L.A

Police returned the wrong kidnapped son


 In spite of overwhelming evidence supporting Collins' objections, the chief of police insisted she was over-reacting from the traumatic experience of the kidnapping and had her committed to a mental hospital


 Better that than admitting the possibility that she was right and they were wrong.As a single parent who was also a career woman, Christine Collins was ahead of her time
 So was the radical, but compassionate minister who fortunately was interested in her case


 Together they managed to release her and all the other wrongfully admitted patients who were also committed to the hospital by the power of police brutality
 They brought down the police force in court, giving the story an uplifting ending, leading the way for hope.For the realistic portrayal of the times, the horror of the events, and the acting from Jolie down to her youngest co-stars, this is a classic portrayal of a true-life event

 Viewers could walk away wondering how much things have changed and how much they stayed the same
 There's still abuse of power and wrongfully accused and committed victims, but more importantly, there's still the possibility that a few strong and dedicated people standing up for what is right can still make a difference.

$review_text.: This is the story of a magnificent, amazing and miraculous horse. It is also a historical drama portraying some of the most horrifying aspects of The Great War (WW I) as seen through the horse's eyes. It is adapted from a childrens' novel written by the excellent author of childrens' literature, Michael Morpurgo. To those who believe the plot is too simplistic, sappy or childish and the animals too anthropomorphic, well HELLO...remember the original target audience. That does not mean this movie is for children only...in fact, since it depicts some rather gruesome aspects of war, judgement should be used in taking children to see it. Except for the very young, it should appeal to all age groups. As with most Spielberg films the cinematography is outstanding...especially the scenery shot in Devon which is absolutely breathtaking. The John Williams soundtrack too, perfectly sets the mood for the story. The casting, both human and animal, is spot-on. Jeremy Irvine, in his film debut, was an excellent selection to play Albert Naricott, the original owner and trainer of Joey, a beautiful chestnut stallion. You will marvel, I know I did, that horse cavalry was still used, at least in the early stages of WW I...against German machine guns.

I will tell you about it in my review right now.The bad things about this movie is that the asylum is lacking in computer graphics,the acting is ok but,is like the graphics it's kinda youtube graphics(the graphics are low classed)


The camera working needs work because the movie is mostly computer graphics they need to show more stuff that does not need any computer graphics

Now the nudity scene it doesn't make any sense in this movie, they shouldn't have any nudity in it


When the shark was chasing the boat, the shark's only head left it was switching sides of it's body and it's pretty embrassing to do that

And finally about the story, this movie would be more better by showing how the shark came into being.The good thing about this movie is that it has a good level of gore, nice level of violence, good action thats happening in some parts of the movie, some suspense
And maybe everybody would like a really good ending.So keep telling what you feel about this movie ok.

$REVIEW.: Hundreds of reviews? What's all the fuss about? This is very much a film of two halves. The first half is a classic slapstick romance, the second half, a black comedy. These two link together, but the change of pace is  jarring and is signalled by the arrival of the main characters at a  concentration camp. I wondered how it could be possible to make a comedy of  the holocaust, and now I know - depict a fantasy rather than reality. The  film is 'unrealistic' in the extreme, but this only partly detracts from  the main message, that life and love are stronger than fear and death. I'm  not a person who laughs out loud at slapstick - and here yet another egg in  the hat routine bores me. But despite the sometimes formulaic pratfalls  this film has some comedic moments that are truly inspired. Benigni's  arrival at the town school to explain and inadvertantly debunk racial  superiority, for instance, or his impromptu 'translation' of the rules of  the concentration camp, are simultaneously hilarious and poignant. If  you're looking for a film about the holocaust, this isn't it. But if you're  looking for a great sentimental comedy with some fine moments, this is one  for you. If you've already seen it and loved it, try 'Il Postino' (The  Postman). Its better.

$review_text.: In the DVD bonus interviews for this movie, the people involved with the project claim originality for it. However the author of the film's script admits to being a lifelong film buff. And I think he unwittingly re-wrote "Taxi Driver" when he composed this material.This movie follows the same general arc as "Taxi Driver." It pursues the same general theme of a man trapped on the fringes of society, with no one to invest his love in, with nowhere to go but into an increasingly elaborated fantasy in which he features himself as heroic rescuer of a lady in distress. But instead of weaving his fantasy out of the cloth of New York's mean streets, the hero of "Down in the Valley" casts himself as a cowboy in the Old West. His joust with the world takes the form of a perpetual shoot-out, a perpetual need to get the drop on his opponents.The parallel between the two movies extends even to the heroes' rehearsing their respective challenges to the world in front of a mirror. Only instead of building muscle and asking, "You talkin' to me?" - this hero practices his draw and commands, "Reach `em high!"This duplication of a classic movie isn't a bad thing. There is room for another take on "Taxi Driver." Edward Norton is a sweeter, gentler Travis Bickle, although we early get the same intimations of his capacity to become dangerous.This movie is also somewhat more realistic than "Taxi." Edward Norton's character similarly meets circumstances in his surroundings that feed into his fantasy. At one point, he finds himself in a wild west setting built for a movie shoot. It's a coincidence, but it's a little more likely than the over-the-top brothel combat in which Robert de Niro gets to live out his dream. And although Edward Norton's fantasy also absorbs him and becomes a mythic re-enactment, it's still a development that could conceivably take place in California's San Fernando Valley where this movie is set. You won't be left wondering, endlessly debating whether or not the conclusion is meant as a dream sequence.But as with almost all of Edward Norton's films, his performance is the main reason to watch and praise the movie. Here he plays the character of Harlan with a combination slyness/shyness that kept me on edge, but that also deeply touched me.

$REVIEW.: This film is about one thing and one thing only: action. The film starts off w/the credits flying by in a haze of flashback scenes depicting the Hulk's origins, getting around the hour-long development which "plagued" the previous version (HULK - 2003). After the flashback sequences are finished, the movie throws you directly into the story as it has developed thus far. Banner is in hiding from the US Army, in South America, attempting to cure himself of the curse that has afflicted him. The film quickly moves into action, w/a chase sequence which leads the viewer through back streets and over the rooves of an enormous 3rd world city of shacks and decaying apartment buildings. One of the most popular scenes in the film takes place on a college campus, where military personnel attempt to take Banner into custody, but instead cause him to transform into his enormous, green counterpart.An action movie through and through, this film still has good performances from Edward Norton and Tim Roth. Less than Incredible performances from Liv Tyler and William Hurt keep this movie from attaining too much life, though. Roth's enjoyable portrayal of the self-centered and egomaniacal Major Emil Blonsky keeps things moving along despite sharing numerous scenes w/Hurt's slow and lackluster atttempts at character portrayal. Live Tyler works w/what she's given in this film which, unfortunately, wasn't much. Better writing for the character of Betty Ross would have been nice, but is not absolutely necessary, as Miss Ross' character is used primarily as a driving force for the Hulk's outbursts. When Hulk isn't about to be on-screen, her lines are primarily of a semi-comedic nature, which keeps the film feeling lightweight and fun, albeit nothing more.Overall, this film is just about everything the 2003 version was not - an over-the-top action-adventure story, full of cars being ripped apart and earth-shaking punches. If you want Incredible action, the Incredible Hulk delivers.
$SUMMARY.: The Incredible Hulk = Incredible Action

$review_text.: This collection has some Yosemite Sam shorts, including the one where he plays Riff Raff Sam in the desert, riding his camel in pursuit of Bugs Bunny, and the one where he plays the knight in black armor and rides the green dragon that abuses Sam in several amusing ways. So far, I haven't seen any of these collections (1 through 4) include the one where Sam gets blown skyward in his "cabin in the sky" or the one where he's in the castle, about to inherit a substantial amount of money if only he could control his temper! Those are two more classic Yosemite Sam shorts.The Speedy Gonzales disc includes a film with Slowpoke Rodriguez, who was a rare, but fun, character in Looney Tunes.The inclusion of these films make this collection an especially enjoyable set for me.Now, let's get to more Marvin the Martian shorts! Maybe set 5 has these?

You have Ferris, the ultra cool kid who knows how to perfectly play his school, his friends, and his parents to his advantage.  And then you have Cameron, the self-conscience everyman struggling through his teenage years.  In a single day, along with Ferris' girlfriend, they live out the ultimate high school hookie fantasy.The movie is hilarious, uplifting, and touching at the same time.

$review_text.: "Dirty Harry" and "Magnum Force" are arguably the two best Dirty Harry flicks, although fans can argue about this endlessly.  This double feature is too good to pass up and for the price is an outrageous bargain.  The mastering/remastering here is very good, and fans will like having a Blu-Ray copy of these films in the library.  "Dirty Harry" is a classic "Good versus Evil" film (has any villain ever been more evil than the villain in this film?) while Magnum Force, by contrast, warns of vigilantism and the danger of cops taking the law into their own hands.  Messages aside, these are excellent, fast-paced films that entertain with humor, violence, and Eastwood's best acting ever.  Highly recommended.  RJB.

$REVIEW.: Ang Lee is pretty damn amazing. Here is a Chinese filmaker with an ouvre that includes such varied work as Brokeback Mountain, Hulk, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Eat Drink, Man Woman, Lust, Caution, and now Life of Pi (all except for Hulk pretty brilliant). That one man can capture both the unique Chinese flavor of Crouching Tiger and the Western American rhythm of Brokeback. Amazing.Now we have this film, which resists all categorization. At one level, it's an eminently watchable survival adventure and pure visual treat. I haven't read the book yet (I will now), but I have to asume it has a fable-like quality, and so does the film. The color alone is surreal and intense. The cinematography is gorgeous. Some of the shots... woah. There is some odd unreal nighttime lighting here too -- although it works. There is very heavy use of shallow depth of field to good effect.It's worth noting that I saw the film in 3D, which has clearly graduated from three years ago when it was only for the likes of Alice in Wonderland (hiss) and How to Train Your Dragon. Now we have it in high budget literary adventure religious allegory. Interestingly, I'm pretty convinced that 3D has the effect of decreasing realism. It makes everything look like CGI, heightened, super-real, like an HDR photograph.The acting is also superb. The casting of Pi at various ages is dead on. All three are highly emotive. And the tiger -- who is presumably 90% CGI -- he's the stuff of legend. There is one damn cool animal. The soggy cat hanging off the side of the boat is just so sad, lest us forget that the Bengal Tiger is the world's most dangerous land animal. Tiger's are fast, deadly, climb, swim, and can bat your head off with one paw. Imagine sharing a lifeboat with one! There's a 19th century tiger known to have killed over 430 men.The film is to beautiful, that the ocean itself, and its bevy of sea life, becomes a character. As desperate as Pi (and Richard Parker the Tiger) are, they can't help but marvel at the little seen wonders that present, and us with them.Thematically, I'm not yet sure how to digest Life of Pi. It's a pretty deeply emotional movie, and at some level plays to the film medium's visual strengths. The picture hints at deeper philosophical notes, but doesn't really illuminate. I sense extreme abbreviation. After all, 450 pages of novel would result in perhaps six hours of film.Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimed

$REVIEW.: Raise the Red Lantern is a great film. It's five stars all the way. This DVD however, is pretty disappointing. It's letterboxed, which is about the best thing I can say for it. It's obviously mastered from a very used print. It looks quite similar to a print I saw at a Zhang Yimou retrospective at a film festival about 5 years ago, lustrous still, but covered in scratches. As for the color bleed, I think SOME of it is intentional. I know three-strip technicolor is sometimes shot without aid of a filter in order to get that glowy effect-- how much is hard to tell though, since this is obviously not even remotely the best source. The picture quality is not the only issue. The sound could use a little cleaning up as well, and the English subtitles were riddled with the kinds of mistakes common to cheap, bootlegged versions of Chinese cinema. One exmple was use of the word "savant" when "servant" was intended. Since this is the only official Raise the Red Lantern DVD in the US, it may be how many people are introduced to the film, and that's not good. Raise the Red Lantern deserves much, much better.

$review_text.: Bruno Kirby passed away not too long ago...wow...it really kind of blew me away...he was so young and talented and still had so much to offer the world. But we must not be overly sad at his death, we must know and feel that even now the life that Bruno Kirby was/is/and will always be is doing even greater things...I love this movie. I watch this movie every time I'm in the "dumps". No matter how much my life has improved over the years, there are those days where I just don't feel I'm doing enough. I don't think this makes me "nagative" as much as it means that I am human. The whole reason why we don't think our life is living up to our expectations is because deep within our soul, we know that we have EVEN MORE to express, extend, and experience...This movie especially moves me now because I am in my early 40s. When I first saw it, I thought it was funny, but I couldn't totally relate to it. I thought that I was eons away from becoming 40. (It gets here sooner than you realize, kid...) I mean, I remember when my dad turned 40 and I could never get as old as my dad!Yeah, okay...dream on...This movie will make you look at life differently, that is, if you are willing to look at life differently. If you just go into it thinking it's just going to be a funny movie with Bruno Kirby and Billy Crystal and Daniel Stearn, then that is just what you'll get, but if you go into it with a willingness to see it as a metaphor for life, you will get this as well.Y'see, everyone talks about women going through the change of life...men go through a change, as well. But as a rule, we don't talk about things like that. Men are always supposed to be stoic and strong and able to leap tall buildings with a single bound...not true...we are not made of steel...we are made of bone and blood and muscle...we are bound by the same laws as everyone else and sometimes, we feel even more pressure to become something or do something big and when we haven't made the deadline or scored the touchdown or hit the home run by the time we thought we would, we feel like even more of a failure.But just like the movie suggests, Life is a "do over". We can decide today to begin again. To shake the dust of our butts and get right back in the saddle.YEEEEE-HAAAAAA!Oh, life is good people...life is good! Thank you, Bruno Kirby for making this movie part of our document to human history.

$review_text.: FAERIE TALE THEATRE's touching and tender recreation of THE LITTLE MERMAID (the second-last in the series) is one of their best efforts.Pearl (Pam Dawber) is a beautiful young mermaid who lives with her father King Neptune (Brian Dennehy) and her sisters Coral and Anemonie (Donna McKechnie and Laraine Newman) in a kingdom at the bottom of the ocean. When Pearl comes of age and is allowed a brief glimpse of the world above the sea, she falls in love with a handsome Prince (Treat Williams) whom she saves from drowning when his ship has a fatal explosion.She makes a bargain with the Sea Witch (Karen Black): her voice in exchange for a pair of legs and hopefully the love of the Prince. Once on land Pearl quickly returns to the Prince, though he only has eyes for the lovely Princess Emilia (Helen Mirren).What follows is a heartbreaking story of selfless love and sacrifice, as Pearl risks everything for true love...Pam Dawber leads a strong cast. Karen Black is amazing as the Sea Witch; Newman and McKechnie are a delight as Pearl's sisters and Treat Williams fills the role of the Prince admirably. A true gem in the series

$review_text.: While some of the other movies in The Bible Series have been magnificent, this particular one falls short, and was very disappointing
 Although the music is very period-like for the era, the program is confusing in its depiction of Adam and Eve and the serpent
 What was intriguing, however, was the concept of Eve not being Caucasian


 In that part of the world (Middle East), it would only stand to reason that Eve would be a woman of color

 Then things moved quickly to Noah, and another very disappointing scene
 The ark didn't even look like the historical ark, and those who entered the ark looked like the entire neighborhood


 Not a very good depiction

$review_text.: Ryan Coogler demonstrates the  the kind of film  that can be created with a vision. His deft script elevates what could have been a heavily politicized &#34;Blacksplotion&#34; film into a work of art focused on the everyman that Oscar Grant (Michael B Jordan) was in life, rather than his tragic death at the hand of a BART policeman, and its aftermath.That's not to say the incident of his death is ignored, but rather it takes a backseat to his life, his relationships with his daughter((Ariana Neal), girlfriend( Melonie Diaz), mother(Octavia Spencer) and his extended family and friends..Michael B Jordan primarily known for character work rises to the leading male role with aplomb.Octavia Spencer is up to her usual standards  . Ariana Neal is quite gifted and someone to watch.Although the subject matter , based on a true story, is sad, the film is entertaining , engrossing and worth seeing by all.It richly deserved the Awards it won at Sundance in 2013 (Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award).Highly recommended!

$review_text.: Earlier this year, HBO offered yet another ground breaking series - this one revolving around marital strife and therapy
Opting for realism, the stories are interspersed with intensive therapy sessions, some of the most realistic and explicit intimate scenes ever presented on television, and the daily routine of couples in three stages of relationships (four if you count therapist May played by Jane Alexander and her husband of 43 years, played by David Selby).David and Katie (Tim DeKay and Ally Walker from "Profiler") have been married 12 years and have grown so far apart that they are not longer intimate
Katie wants therapy to repair their distance while David just wants to skate by and pretend everything is okay


Palek and Carolyn (Adam Scott and Sonya Walger) are yuppies who have everything they could ever want except for a baby (though Palek wonders if he even wants that)


Jamie and Hugo (Michelle Borth and Luke Ferrell Kirby) are an engaged couple who break up early on due to Jamie's trust issues with Hugo's fidelity

But soon another man enters her life (Ian Somerhalder, the brother from "Lost" who loved his sister a little too much), forcing Jamie to face the truth about her own past.Extras include reactions to story lines by real life couples (which really don't add much), as well as behind the scenes and the usual making of shorts

It's a heavy series and oftentimes depressing; there is nothing light to the storylines, in fact viewers will wonder if any therapist can save some of these crumbling relationships.

$REVIEW.: To the long and already rambling list of attempts to juice up Sherlock Holmes for mass media audiences, we add this well-meaning but misguided whirlwind.  In what appears to be a pilot that never went to series, Holmes' preteen street squad takes center stage in an attempt to fight through the wall of crime that is Victorian London.  This one is blessed with an excellent Holmes in Jonathan Pryce, but is marred by an inability to decide what story it wants to tell.Some other reviewers have disparaged the way in which this telemovie retcons the role of Irene Adler.  I'm not sure the target audience of young viewers would much care.  I suspect that they would be more interested in the fact that the child characters' hand-wringing is particularly unappealing.  If the kids were to pull their thumbs out, the whole story would be over in thirty minutes.This story has its redeeming moments, particularly when the emphasis shifts to the grown-ups.  But then, why pretend this was produced for kids?  I really liked watching Pryce as Holmes trying to solve the mystery without leaving his lodgings.  The layers he has to work through make these parts of the story interesting.  But on the whole, this movie is a miss that doesn't have much of an idea who its audience is, or how to make them care.

$review_text.: 1975's "Lucky Lady" was probably hoping to make an equally successful film out of what was obviously inspired by "The Sting."  So they had the two rogues perhaps a little oddly matched and figured they could even add spice by making the film about a menage a trois, make it a quasi-musical with a few Kander and Ebb songs for Liza as a prohibition cabaret girl (cashing in a on those who still believed in her performance in "Cabaret") in a film about rum runner buccaneers.  Believing in the three stars could have counted for something, except that Burt Reynolds was one of them and he was getting near his irresponsible non-acting performances in the "Smokey and the Bandit" films and numerous others where mugging for the camera substituted for acting.  Gene Hackman, usually a good actor, seems almost to have surrendered to the impossibility of this film coming out afloat.  Liza gives the most professionally competent performance  as she probably felt a little responsible with the title and all but she is not good enough an actor to survive with a great performance.  Written by the duo who brought us "American Graffiti" in 1973, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz and a usually great director, Stanley Donen, but Donen had prior brought us the gawking spectacle of Richard Burton and Rex Harrison as two stereotypical homosexuals in "Staircase."  There was probably more of a reason why "Staircase" and "Lucky Lady" were never on home video until Shout Factory brought us "Lucky Lady" recently than just oversight.  In "Lucky Lady" the three stars bombard us with "irascible" charm that embarrasses us as we are played for stooges who do not need believability in our stories more than the stars laughing and mugging and saying lines about "fish farting."  The movie is so expensive and indulgent that there is a log as an extra that counts down the enormous budgetary delays from filming on the sea (with no miniatures) that becomes just another one long joke.  With all the hoopla about how the movie was a gross miscalculation by 20th Century-Fox and a huge flop that went through three endings before the one that, because you just have to watch it twice, it really is not as bad as that.  Yes, the film is lucky that it can survive that first viewing successfully as almost entertaining despite the bad reviews.  But then, it really is a lot unfunny as it expects us to be wowed by, even with an extraordinary budget, really so little.  John Hillerman is pretty good as the villain, too, but Robby Benson is completely wasted, or then just too much a talent to see do so little and perhaps thereby mis-cast.  The photography has a kind of haze about it as if filmed through some kind of gauze filter, which is sort of nice.  The make-up jobs are generally not so good, as are hairpieces or lack of them (Gene Hackman needed some help in some scenes considering the magnitude of their star billing).  There is only luck in "Lucky Lady" to be had, no tears, no real laughs, no suspense, nothing like that.  You just can't believe your eyes what you had just seen.

$review_text.: I used to hate kung fu movies as a kid, but years later after having never seen this film, I must say I was thoroughly entertained! The story really drives this film (in it's originality) and the actors are all truly amazing; great heroes, great villains and a deadly tournament!The extras on this disc are numerous and make for quite a tribute to Mr. Lee, and the Lee legacy. The transfer is astonishing for its age (I love how grand it feels as the airplane flies overhead in the opening - as only HD can present) the soundtrack is very nice...a little action, a little orient and a little funk!Mr. Hans hands are a bit cheesy and unmenacing, but I imagine that if they were aware of what a masterpiece they were creating they surely would have put forth a little more effort in some of these minor details, but in the grand scheme of things, it really doesn't matter."Enter the Dragon" on HD DVD is an excellent way to take a look at the past when you're feeling nostalgic with all of its outdoor imagery from a variety of locations - this film has some wonderful shots. It's also a nice way to just have a good time when you're in the mood for a classic action movie!I love this film and have viewed it multiple times. I can't say enough good things about it, and it truly is a shame that Mr. Lee didn't live long enough to add a few more of these gems to Hollywood history - he really was an amazing talent.I highly recommend this film.

$review_text.: In a moment of Christmas spirit overload I pick up two copies of this movie. One for the office party and one for myself.I get home and see it's PG-13 and figure I'll watch it with my daughter after the spousal unit falls asleep. What momma doesn't know can't hurt her.The Howling III starts off pretty good. Cheesey special effects (none of that CG crud) , quirky characters, and good looking women. Typical 80's horror with the exception of it being filmed in Australia.Basically a band of marsupial werewolves live in the outback to avoid man's encroachment and scientists that may want to do experiments on them. After all, they are werewolves with pouches, that's fairly rare these days.The first half of the movie had plenty of good old fashioned special effects and entertaining sequences that kept both my daughter and I interested. Of course it was a bit uncomfortable when the lead female (Kanga-lycanthrope) gives birth to a little marsupial werewolf baby. Ugly little bugger at that!The second half of the flick just doesn't have enough special effect type sequences to keep it interesting.You may think the storyline has enough clout to stand on it's own but it doesn't.Still I'm happy to add it to my collection of 80's horror films.The DVD is of good quality.(widescreen) and it does contain several extras which is rare for a film of this type and price.Good day mate!!

$REVIEW.: This is something to watch when you're in the mood for a pure out and out blood and guts fest. And given the two volumes that have come out so far, this is the tame one!The visuals are sharp with bold colors and smooth lines. The bluray quality is superb and you can easily find yourself sucked into the story. The color contrast is well done and makes it easy to follow the sometimes chaotic pace  (that's a good thing) of the story.I think the most amazing part of this particular volume is easily the sound quality. While I find the second set (5-8) has better visual quality (in terms of colors and details) the sound quality on this set is amazing. The song the vampiress sings in episode 4 is so sharp it's like being in a concert hall. I've had to replay that song alone several times just because it is so well sung. Absolutely amazing.If you haven't seen Hellsing Ultimate, read a review of the story and check it out. It's great but I'll freely admit it's not for everyone. This volume could even be considered tame compared to the second set, so know what you are getting into before you buy. This is a very, VERY, bloody anime not only takes the gore up a notch, it completely obliterates the scale in terms of animated violence.

$REVIEW.: No plot spoilers!Contrary to what you might have read here and elsewhere, 'Another Earth' is definitely a science fiction tale.  Unfortunately, many people believe if there aren't space monsters or robots, it's not a science fiction piece.  A work, such as this one, can be more focused on human nature and the reaction to different 'science fiction' happenstances than to the special effects themselves.'Another Earth' is a beautiful exploration of ruined lives, and the thought that maybe things done can be undone.  In that way, there are some elements of fantasy involved.  Here, the strange appearance of another Earth gives a scientific plausibility to the fantasy.Brit Marling is luminous as Rhoda Williams, who yearns for second chances.  William Mapother plays John Burroughs, who is the object of Rhoda's dream of putting things right, though she goes about it in a terribly precarious manner.A note on the production values.  It definitely has an 'indie' look.  The film was shot on film instead of video, which is a good choice to give a rich, warm look.  But there are a lot of hand-held shots which were disconcerting.  And the rapid zooms really gave the film a more of an amateurish look, in my opinion.  And there are several instances of poor focus that the camera operator rapidly tries to find the correct focus.  That detracts from the look of the film.The appearance of Earth II is not impossible, if one subscribes to the parallel universe thinking, or the multiple world idea.  Think of a Earth of a parallel universe that shows up suddenly, as the membranes they dwell on come closer and closer together.  Research string theory and judge for yourself.Strongly recommended.  Intelligent science fiction films are a rarity; this joins the short list of such films.

Unfortunately this effort is embarrassingly inept, and repeats - but without the charm - many of the episodes present in the previous story.

$REVIEW.: Here's a review from someone who actually has this item. So, let me get to the point. The box set is out of this world! I have all the seasons in my collection from their first release date. So, when I finally decided to go ahead and pick up the Complete Series, I was alittle worried that I was wasting my money by buying the seasons agian. But, when the box set came in by UPS yeasterday. I was blown away by the sight, wieght and very high quality of the item. It's has two book like dvd holders that are split by 1st to 5th seasons and 6th to 10th seasons. It's made of highly compressed board and will stay togather for a very long time. WB pulled out all the stops on this great set. It also comes with a very detailed Daily Planet news paper and a high gloss 24 page epoisode quide.Not only is it the best set I've ever seen. It's has over 24 hours (two dvd's) of new features that will not be on the regular Season Ten set. I am a blu-ray owner and I can tell you the DVD's qaulity are great (plus any player will up sample the discs to almost 1080 dpi) So, this set only being released in DVD is not a problem for me. The set is so well put to gather I know if you decide to pick it up. You will not be dissapointed.

$REVIEW.: I was fully expecting "Dude, Where's My Burgers?", but instead got a pretty good buddy comedy.  This is NOT some 1 1/2 hour-long commercial for a fast-food joint - and is thankfully NOT your typical "stoner" comedy.The main characters are not your typical pot-heads, like Cheech & Chong or Jay & Silent Bob.  These are two guys who are very intelligent, and just happen to like to partake over the weekend.  The one works at an investment firm, and seems to be fairly responsible.  The other is smart enough to be a doctor, if he didn't want to fall into the sterotypical Indian path.The hillarious things that happen to them along the way to get some food are unbelievable, and the film is well written enough to let the characters really seem like life-long friends.  The hitchiker they pick up is probably the highlight of the film, but there's plenty of other laughs here.Supposedly, the actors have signed on for two sequels.  I'm really looking forward to them - and that's something I never thought I'd say when seeing the previews to this one.

$REVIEW.: Robert Bresson's 1950 breakthrough film, Diary Of A Country Priest (Journal D'Un Cure De Campagne), is one of those films that is absolutely antithetical to everything a Hollywood film stands for. It is obsessive, detailed, slow, and opaque. This, however, does not mean it is a great film, as so many knee-jerk critics claim it is. It is not; but it is a very interesting film. Ostensibly, it may seem to be a film on religion and/or suffering, or, as film critic Fr&eacute;deric Bonnard claims, in The Criterion Collection's DVD essay on the film, a film `about imprisonment,' but it's neither, really. It's more cogently a film about masochism, guilt, and pathological privation, although it does touch upon religion, suffering, and imprisonment. The film was not only directed by Bresson (his fourth of thirteen films), but also adapted by Bresson from the 1936 novel of the same title by Georges Bernanos. Anyone familiar with the works of Carl Theodor Dreyer will be familiar with the techniques used by Bresson- although this film is less stagey and more intimate in tone, but Bresson's cinematographer, L&eacute;once-Henry Burel, is not as slow and deliberate as Dreyer, nor does the film depend so heavily on the juxtaposition between light and dark as Dreyer's works do. There is a `lightness' in Bresson's film that is absent from Dreyer's- both in terms of the gauzey and diffused visuals and intellect. This is not to say that Bresson's film lacks depth, it's merely not as dependent upon a grand philosophical posit as Dreyer's films are.... Yet, the film never reaches the heights that other religiously meditative films, such as Ingmar Bergman's Winter Light, do, mostly because of the very blandness of the narrative. Whereas Bergman's film transcends religion and cores into universal human behavior, Diary Of A Country Priest merely presents its simple narrative, and if one cannot get into it- for its religious-specific ideas, so be it. Also, the film never gets truly inside the young priest. Why, for example, does he even keep a diary? All it seems to be is a book filled with gossip and his petty and self-serving observations. Yet, the film likens the priest to a Christ-like character, rather than a mere outcast. Since outcasts are universal, why does Bresson decide to affiliate the lead character with the remote Christ and not the ubiquitous nebbish? After all, the priest has no name, and this is clearly done to universalize him, even though a priest, by definition, is a non-universal figure. Not that a Christ complex could not be compelling onscreen, just that this particular one is not, for all this character can muster are vapid apothegms such as, `The desire to pray is already prayer,' "I was a victim of the Holy Agony,' or his dying words, as related by Dufr&eacute;ty: `What does it matter? Everything is grace.'Were only those words true this film would recapitulate their meaning. Failing that, it at least tries, something that, again, Hollywood films do not even dare. Perhaps that young priest was on to something?

When the lights came up, we found ourselves as reluctant to leave the cinematic experience as the soldiers were to return to Italy.Tima &amp; time again, I find myself returning to this wonderful little gem of a movie, as it provides a certain release for the stress of everyday life.

The first half is effective in setting the mood for a great psychological southern horror piece, but the last 35 minutes seemed like a bad x-files episode.This isn't the Raimi from THE EVIL DEAD, nor the Raimi from SPIDERMAN, it's a little of both, it borderlines on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS caliber psychological horror, and then falls into the pits of plastic hollywood mold.Still, I've seen worse.

$review_text.: Volume 28 of The Star Trek DVD series may be the most bizarre DVD in the series.  Partly because it contains the last episode of the second season and the first epiosde of the third.  These two episodes differ greatly and it is interesting to compare and contrast between them however both of these episodes are above average Trek tales despite their strange differences.ASSIGNMENT: EARTH was the season finale of the second season.  Essentially it was a pilot for a proposed series by the same name.  At the time Star Trek was going to be cancelled and it was quite apparent that Roddenberry developed this to have something to fall back on once the network had made their decision.  I'm assuming Roddenberry was planning to have Robert Lansing and Terri Garr as the main charcters in this new series and have the Star Trek cast make various guest appearnaces.  Anyways as it turned out Star Trek managed to stay on for a further season and Roddenberry and the network ditched the whole 'Assignment:Earth' idea. All we were left with was this strange episode of Star Trek (which makes you wonder if the show had been cancelled and Assignment:Earth had been accepted by NBC).  The episode finds the Enterprise crew travelling back to 1968 (at the time this was aired: modern day earth).  Upon arrival they cross paths with Gary Seven (Robert Lansing) and he has come to earth in order to slow down it evolutionary process to put a stop to destroying themselves.  He does this by sabotaging U.S. rockets and Kirk feels he will change the course of time.  However Seven insists he is doing this for the good of mankind.  The episode is rather strange and complicated as most of the screen time is given to Lansing rather than Shatner which is quite a change.  The rest of the episode involves Kirk and Spock chasing Seven around trying to stop him.  In the end everything turns out fine as usual and the course of time is not affected but  many viewers may be left scratching their heads after this episode is over.  It is good but rather hard to follow.  Terri Garr makes one of her first appearances as Roberta Lincoln a hip chick who applies for a secretary job for Mr. Seven.  The casting was great in this one (Both Lansing and Garr are excellent) and perhaps Roddenberry should have salvaged the Assignment: Earth idea after Star Trek was cancelled in June of 1969?  Sadly this was never done.The other episode here is SPECTRE OF THE GUN which kicked off Star Trek's inconsistant third and final season.  There is such a big change between this and ASSIGNMENT:EARTH.  It's amazing that Star Trek was able stay on for a third season but it's obvious that the production budget was way tighter (which explains the true reason why there are incomplete sets in this episode).  Still this is one of the better episodes in Star Trek's haphazard final season.The Enterprise is abducted by a mysterious alien race called the Melkotians Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty and Chekov beam down to their planet only to end up in a situation where they are the Clampetts in the middle of the historic 'Gun Fight At The OK Corral' against the Earp's.  This episode is ironic because Deforest Kelley did play Morgan Earp in the classic 1957 film.  Despite being another bizarre Star Trek outing SPECTRE OF THE GUN is an awesome episode of Star Trek in my opinion especially for the majority of lackluster scripts submitted in the third season.  Besides the casting of the Earps is impressive and the gunfight at the end is kinda cool.Overall a bizarre pair of episodes but both are wonderful and interesting in their own ways.  SPECTRE OF THE GUN is more enjoyable to watch than ASSIGNMENT:EARTH in my opinion but they are both special.  Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: This is the oldest surviving three color film.  That is film the stuff in the camera I am talking about.  So the reason it gets published now is for historical interest in film methods.  The story is OK, but the image quality is not so hot.  This isn't Kino's fault - the film was in poor condition with many scratches.  Finding a color print was very a coup, but that particular print was not in perfect condition.As usual Fairbanks does nifty stunts, including an underwater attack on a ship, but he does this in many other movies which hold up better today.  The plot here is the usual action stunts and all around good movie, but once again film quality was distracting for me.This movie is unlikely to appeal to most.  Unless you are specifically interested in the color film process you will likely be bored.  University libraries should consider archiving this.  Film students may want to view this movie for its historical importance and to get a glimpse of what technology was available in the mid-20's.  By the way regarding film quality I want to reiterate that Kino does excellent restorations of silent movies.  I am sure that they have done what they could here and done a good job, but starting from a film that needed more restoration.  The fact that this film is available at all is very cool and Kino is a great source for silent movies.
$SUMMARY.: Historic but not so much fun as other Fairbanks films

$REVIEW.: JUST LIKE HEAVEN  finds its audience because of the stars
 Reese Witherspoon, who actually CAN act as we have seen in Vanity Fair and Walk the Line), here falls back on her commercial blockbuster successes like Legally Blonde 1 & 2, etc

 Doubtless films like this one are something she can do in her sleep, and the box office results make it worth her time
 But it is a bit disappointing to see Mark Ruffalo step out of his usual proclivity for choosing films of substance to spend time on fluff like this.The plot is one seen many times before (Ghost, Heaven Can Wait, etc): Witherspoon is the perfect physician who on the eve of her promotion in the hospital is in a fatal car accident


 Mark Ruffalo is a down and out architect who sublets her apartment only to find Witherspoon is a cantankerous spirit/ghost unable to believe she is dead, providing lots of banter between the two  over who owns what


 Funny to a point


Then the plot twists become even more ludicrous and the story proceeds down the path of romantic resolution, becoming a bit preachy along the way.Were is not for the genuine talent of the two stars the film would be a sure cure for insomnia, but Witherspoon and Ruffalo wring the best parts out of a weak script and actually make the film entertaining in spots

$review_text.: We have all seen the news, about certain religious people who have suddenly exhibited violent behavior towards others and even towards themselves
Such news often give me the shivers when supposed decent people become driven to exhibit brutal behavior in what they believe is the way to their salvation

Writer/director Maurice Devereaux's "End of the Line" explores such behavior in a very efficient manner; all the while feeding our fears of the presence of evil
The film is a creepy, scary, thought-provoking look at what believers may say is eve of the end times


Just what do you do if and when your religious leader gives you an order?Karen (Ilona Elkin) is a nurse in a hospital's psychiatric ward
One evening, Karen takes the subway train on her way home from work


Without warning, the train stops to a grinding halt and Karen with the rest of the other passengers become the trapped targets of an apocalyptic religious cult led by Reverend Hope (played by David McCallum) bent on killing them all in the name of their strange god

Karen and the other passengers fight back, but can their feeble resistance stand up to the demonic powers that have cast a shadow this evening? Things look very bleak and all hope is about to be extinguished as the entire world seemed to have been gripped by madness
Is this truly the end of the line for humanity?Maurice Devereaux's very dark and bloody tale may have a very simple premise but he manages to call upon the screenplay's best assets to keep the viewer interested with an intense, taut and gripping script that is well thought out and executed
We see the passengers in the subway train; people from all walks of life on the way to retiring for the evening and this proves to be the film's minor characterization


Once Devereaux, manages to set things up, the direction goes into overdrive with a bloody, unrelenting experience that kept me enthralled for the film's entirety.Now, don't' think that the film is just a simple bloodbath


The film addresses certain themes of blind faith and references certain themes from the Book of Revelation itself

The film's central focus are the followers of this religious cult who has been obviously misled, they use their blades fashioned from a cross to strike down any unbelievers so that they may know salvation

I said that the film references certain ideas from the Bible but I never said that this is a film based on Biblical apocalypse


Devereaux pitches an idea that a false prophet would rise first to pave the way for evil and I believe in this, since the devil would never come to greet you as himself but as a messiah

What is truly sad is when even children are driven to such extreme behavior

The cultists are also willing to kill others but they refuse to commit suicide
The screenplay calls upon an effective twist that involves this cult and the raising of hell's army
After all, what better soldiers can be than those so devout to a cause?Amid all its darkness and chaos, the direction admirably remembers to show a sense of humanity to our protagonist and even to the some members of this cult


The cult members are shown as having a choice when it came to the execution of their "duty"--Sarah (Nina Fillis) and Frankie (John Vamvas) had their orders but they chose not to follow

They are prime examples in believing on what feels right to their heart and never in the teachings of their so-called religion
One of Rev

Hope's lieutenants is torn between his needs of the flesh and the need to make certain that he is `saved'


Two aspects of human trait/behavior is nicely fleshed out; choice and a need to be assured

Mike (Nicolas Wright) and Karen embody the openness to compassion, with the little time they shared, they got to know each other a lot
Sarah and her boyfriend somehow embody the idea that love can be shared between two people with differing beliefs, so long as their hearts are in the right place at the time
Sex is seen as a sin by the cultists, while some believe that it is the expression of love.The film is also a bloodbath and there are quite a good number of scenes that are very graphic
The brutality and violence in the film may not be too hardcore--stabs, hammer strikes, extreme realistic violence are practiced by both the cultists and our protagonists

The violence may be graphic but none so stomach-turning and over-the-top
They all have that realistic simple feel, when terrified people tangle with madmen
However, the film does have a scene that is very unsettling which occurs in the maintenance area when an unborn infant is ripped apart from his mother's womb


Blood and Gore is omnipresent in the proceedings, and director Devereaux cleverly utilizes old-school effects in the form of prosthetics and red ink


I do not like CGI in my horror movies and I commend the direction`s sense in this case
Even the demonic entities who appear in the film are a product of a lot of muddy make up and simple prosthetics with glowing red eyes
One flaw that I can say about the film is the fact that the acting felt a little too uneven


Some of the acting by the cult members feel a little too fake and some scenes a little bit heavy-handed
Another is that the dialogue felt a little too contrived and obligatory at times

Not that they were enough to ruin the film, but it was enough to be noticed."End of the Line" is one very creepy and disquieting film


It portrays certain aspects of very real horror in the form of decent citizens driven to madness due to their own blind faith all the while using the occult and the supernatural as its driving force

It did somewhat remind me of "Prince of Darkness" but this film is much more


Maurice Devereaux knew exactly what he wanted to do with this film; the film managed to maintain its forward momentum that maintained its energy and outright creepiness--what also proves effective is the fact that he manages to put everything together with a large exclamation point that leads to the apocalypse.When you feel a nudge on your shoulder to do something...do you follow because of what you know or what you believe? It's something to think about...Highly Recommended! [4  Stars]

$review_text.: There can't be much dispute about the quality of this work


The staging, the singing, the technical brilliance of the hidef experience both visually and aurally are impeccable


A group of us gathered to experience La Cenerentola in my home


We laughed, we applauded, we smiled to each other sharing the delight.As the review above noted, no magic is involved in this rendering of the Cinderella story

Everything is worked out through the wisdom of Alidoro, the Prince's old sage counselor (sung brilliantly and with all due gravitas by Nathan Berg)


This makes it a comedy well within the human domain


The moral lessons are clear: vanity is illusive and will not serve us well, all of us must treat each other with kindness, virtue is rewarded, and forgiveness and love heal all.The characters are beautifully played and sung


Angelina (la cenerentola herself--Cinderella-sung by Ruxandra Donose)appropriately plays a somewhat withdrawn role at first but grows in vocal power and confidence throughout the opera 

She emerges at the end as a shimmering beauty of brilliant voice


The "evil" stepsisters, Clorinda and Tisbe (Raquela Sheeran and Lucia Cirillo) are presented as very distinguishable comedic personalities whose voices often combine in bell-like harmonies


Don Magnifico, the wicked stepfather, is played to great comedic effect (Luciano Di Pasquale)as a buffoon who is cruel, fearful, and self-delusive at the same time

His is a gem of a performance
(It is with this that we see one of the drawbacks of such high visual resolution: one can easily see where the scalp cover is joined to his temples

But then again, the characters and sets seem almost three-dimensional, so it is a definite plus)
The Prince, Don Ramiro, (Maxim Mironov) is carefully constructed as a major character who must be less prominent than Cinderella herself, so he is a Rossini tenor, somewhere between tenor and counter-tenor

He is young, handsome, recognizes virtue and responds to it honorably, and sings well


Yet it is the other characters who dominate, including Dandini,(Simone Alberghini) the valet the Prince has commissioned to play him while the Prince stays in the background to observe the reactions of the stepdaughters and anyone else hoping to be his bride.Certainly this production shows off the glories of high definition BluRay, but it is the quality of the performances that should really sell this version to the public

For opera lovers, this Opus Arte presentation of the Glyndebourne production (almost always high quality from Glyndebourne and Opus Arte)is truly a must

It is not possible not to revel in this 3-hour delight

Do yourself a favor and get it; you'll love it.

$REVIEW.: Spike Lee's Inside Man may seem like just another cop and robber story until you see the story unravel on screen. Robber Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) has planned a perfect heist that has put career cop Keith Frazier in a fix. Amidst intense negotiation between thw two, power broker Madeline White (Jodie Foster) enters the picture proving herself to be a better negotiator than Fraizer. But everyone has their motives and the interlocking puzzle gets more complex. As the story unfolds, each turn becomesmore unpredictable.Clive Owen is excellent witty robber who's outpacing everyone at every opportunity. Displaying a level of cool collectedness, Owen was convincing as the potentially violent criminal with a broader agenda in mind.Denzel Washington turns in an equally sublime performance playing the detective who's trying to serve justice while battling investigation for corruption. Detecive Fraizer's urgency in taking Russell to task is well portrayed by Washington.Jodie Foster's Medeline White may just play a supporting role but it's no doubt that the actress can handle any role with aplomb. Her character's brimming with calm confidence trying to secure a deal with the robber while enriching her own pockets.Spike Lee's Inside Man is an exciting thrillers with non-stop action and suspense. It cleverly plays out and eventually leaves the audience dazzled and in awe. (A)

$REVIEW.: Many people criticized &quot;Mewtwo Strikes Back&quot; when the first Pokemon movie was released in the US, because in comparison with the excellent Japanese version it was a mess, missing out important things that explained about the characters (such as The Birth Of Mewtwo), and it had sloppy characterization.However, I'm pleased to say that this film is generally much better than the first Pokemon movie. The plot involves a Pokemon collector called Laurence III who wants to capture the three Legendary birds Articuno. Zapdos and Moltres - or the Gods of Ice, Lightning and Fire as they're called here. Unfortunately, this creates a huge problem with Earth's weather patterns, causing violent storms and snow, and it is left up to Ash to get them back, and return things to normal.There are some little hints to the possibility of an Ash/Misty romance in this film - when Ash arrives on the island at the beginning of the movie, a girl called Melody kisses Ash on the cheek which makes Misty really jealous, as well as  some other cute moments.Sadly, in spite of an improved plot I believe that, as before, the choice of music stands out as the film`s downfall and the producers haven`t learnt from the mistakes they made in the first film. Apart from a few exceptions (&quot;The Legend Comes To Life&quot; is a wonderful track), this movie replicates the same pop-styled rubbish used in the First Movie. The remix of the TV theme song (&quot;Pokemon World&quot; performed by Youngstown &amp; Nobody's Angel) is absolutely horrible, with a scratchy beat and synthesized vocals. The campaign to ban vocoders starts here...Next time round, I would like to see a better choice of music which is less pop-orientated, but I`m not holding my breath...Overall though, in spite of the terrible soundtrack, this is a major improvement on the First Movie which I think any Pokemon fan should add to their collection.

$review_text.: I do not expect historical accuracy in every movie about Henry VIII like we've seen it in the BBC production with Keith Michell. Even the BBC production bears some inaccuracies and changes in its script but they do not contradict history like this one!Ah, where to begin? The actor chosen for Henry VIII was dreadfully miscast. The only resemblance was that he had red hair & that's it. The historical Henry VIII towered over everyone surrounding him at his court (He was 6''2, a very unusual height at the time), he didn't speak with a Cockney accent & didn't behave like a drunken brute. Henry VIII, for all that Hollywood attempts to change, was a king of refinement and knowledge. Despite being married to six women throughout his life he was a prude whose behavior towards women & the lords at his court was worthy of a king. I do not expect the genius of Keith Michell from every actor who portrays this role but here we've arrived at a new low! A Henry VIII hitting & raping his wives? Nothing we know of Henry (And his enemies would have been delighted to report such low behavior) suggests that he ever abused any of his wives in such a way. Not even Anne Boleyn or Catherine Howard suffered from his hands directly once he had chosen to send them to the block for whatever offense they may have committed but were left by him in cold blood.Aside from this the wives were portrayed awfully. Has any of the writers here read a history book? Katherine of Aragon was fair & blue eyed (Only the BBC productions got that right) & not slender, dark eyed & dark haired. She never spoke in such a fashion to Anne Boleyn for it would have been beyond her dignity to address the matter to anyone, much less to the lady who caused it. Helena Bonham Carter was too old to play 19 year old Anne, plus she was obviously pregnant.It goes on and on.... Breaches of etiquette, inaccurate costumes & hairstyles, overly corny executions...These days it's in to rewrite history in Hollywood. But not in a way that produced enchanting little masterpieces like "Young Bess" or "The private life of Henry VIII"....no, history is reduced to a tabloid soap.

 This movie poses the question:  Would you wait patiently for your girl to fall back in love with you every day?  What do you think some of these people with amnesia have to do?  I love Drew Barrymore and ahe did an excellent job in this flick as Lucy


 She and Adam Sandler have great chemistry and you can buy it in this movie


 Rob Schneider is hilarious as Ula and his kids will have you holding your stomach in laughter

 Sean Astin and Blake Clark also provide some memorable funny moments as Doug, the 'steroid lovin goofy older brother' and Marlin 'the loving father who tries to protect Lucy' and has to learn to trust Henry(Sandler)

 Boyfriends will be chuckling at the scene when Henry takes Lucy to meet Jocko the walrus and she asks his 'relationship input'

 The rest of us suckers for romance will be enjoying the predicatable but romantic as hell ending!  Plus an awesome bonus is the soundtrack rocks!

$REVIEW.: SHREK THE THIRD offers some interesting crossroads for our favorite green ogre (Michael Myers). With Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) frog father on his deathbed, Shrek has had to serve as king of Far Far Away in the interim.  And uneasy lies the crown.  We have some knee-slapping good times watching Shrek to his level-best to be the king to the people, but even an ogre with a good heart just isn't cut out to be the king.  He messes up nearly everything he dies, and he stinks at being the king.  Shrek is the first to admit this.Thankfully, Eddie Murphy is back as Donkey and Antonio Banderas returns as Puss In Boots. The movie just wouldn't have been the same without them. Their constant bickering and commentary helped move that plot and the characters along quickly. Plus they got some of the funniest lines in the movie.Prince Charming returns as the villain in this one. The opener showing him working dinner theater in a low level pub is just hilarious. The effort so fits the character, and so does all the grief he takes at the hands of the audience. Of course, he's trying to exorcize his demons by starring in a play where he triumphs over Shrek, which is what he thinks he should have done in the first place.Then, and I'm going to use a line here that was painfully obvious in the movie that was never used, Fiona's father croaks (he's a frog, remember?). But before he does, actually after several false alarms, he tells Shrek that there is one other heir to the kingdom of Far Far Away: a young boy named Arthur.Shrek resolves to go find Arthur and crown the boy king. All Shrek wants to do, all Shrek ever wants to do, is get back to his beloved swamp and get on with sharing his life with Fiona. But when he boards the ship to begin his voyage, Fiona tells him she is pregnant. It's all too much for Shrek. The nightmare he has about having ogre children is absolutely side-splitting. Not only that, but the movie double dips on the whole nightmare premise and caught me flat-footed on one of the quick twists.In the meantime, back in the heart of villainy, Prince Charming retreats to a pub where all the evil characters in the fairy tales hang out and begrudge their existence. The scene where Charming rallies the troops really works. I was ready to vote for him myself.After that, we're treated to a series of eye-popping adventures as Shrek goes back to high school to get Artie, which is how Arthur is known among his peers. Shrek also discovers that Arthur is the much-maligned prey of the school bullies and butt of all practical jokes. No one likes him.With nothing there to stay for, Arthur decides to join Shrek and go back to be the king. Along the way Shrek ends up playing the father role to Arthur, which could have been predicted but still played well.With the end of the movie in sight, everything is up for grabs. The visual comedy in the combat scenes is amazing. The twists and turns the plot makes as it follows a much-trod path are brilliant. It's the little things in the Shrek films that add up to big laughs.  Like the pay-for-play window Pinocchio dances in while Shrek is trying to get information about the location of Fiona. Like Arthur throwing himself on the ground and crying his eyes out to get Merlin to help them get home. Like Donkey, while possessed by Puss In Boots, when he tries to make all his fur stand on end like a cat. Like Donkey's kids when they spelled out the smoke message that tells him they love him.One of the best things to come out of left field, and there were several, was Fiona's speech to the princesses of Far Far Away to rally them into a combat force. Sleeping Beauty's attack on the tree guards at the gate to the city is simply amazing, and I found myself lifting my jaw off the floor and laughing out loud. Music is so much a part of the Shrek movies, and there's plenty of it on the soundtrack.I always go see the Shrek movies on the big screen, and I have a hard time waiting for the DVD release so I can watch them again. Despite my attention to the screen, there's always something I miss. Plus so many of the laughs can be enjoyed over and over. Like the Gingerbread Man's Six Million Dollar Man run through the fields. I can't wait for the DVD, and I can't wait to see if there will be - hopefully - a SHREK 4.

There's a warmup and cooldown and three levels of exercise that can be done separetly or in any combination you choose.  The joy of this tape of course is Bob.  He reaches through the screen and makes the viewer feel that he is training only you.  His charm and encouragement helps you maintain the active pose just a little bit longer than you would have if you didn't feel that he was watching you.  You will get a good workout beginning with the basics through advanced levels.

$REVIEW.: I recently saw this film again after several years and I enjoyed as much as I had done when I first saw it when in was released onto video at the end of the 1980s.  The Seventh Sign was not your run of the mill horror  film.  What it lacked in blood, guts and gore, it made up for other ways.  The acting was excellent; Demi Moore was brilliant as the pregnant young  woman about to give birth to the first soulless child who will herald the  end of the world.  Jurgen Prochnow in turn was superb as God's witness on  earth and even Michael Biehn gave credence to his supporting role as Demi's  disbelieving husband.  Many Jacobs who plays the young Jewish boy Avi also  deserves a mention, all in all the entire cast were brilliant. This is a  much under-rated film as it is intriguing, atmospheric, and well put  together. If you get the chance to rent, buy or borrow this film, then do  so, it is well worth it and you won't be disappointed.

It's happy, it's sad, it's beautiful, it's fun, it's touching, it's inspirational.  I know the author of the books deserves the credit for the interpretation of these mythic figures, but the movie really brings them to life in an excellent way.  They are both familiar and yet strangely odd and refreshing in ways you might not have thought of them before.  Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: That's the 1st thing that came in my mind when I 1st watched this movie some years back, seeing Tom Selleck play in a baseball movie. Yet I find it hard to believe it how underrated this movie was & still is.As there's already a brunch of reviews posted on this, I'll just explain the highlights- Selleck plays a baseball player whose team the New York Yankees trades him off to the Nagoya Chunichi Dragons where he befriends fellow American Max "Hammer" Dubois (played by Dennis Haysbert- the current spokesperson for AllState) & gets into a culture clash with the Japanese with how they play the American pastime. love the "ball game can't end in a GD tie." quote) In all this he falls in love with the team manager's daughter Hiroko (Aya Takanashi)- a beautiful & charming lady who while does show interest in Selleck's character Jack, does not put up with his nonsense. A shame this would be the only movie Ms. Takanashi will appear in.In terms of special features, there's just an extended trailer for this movie & "Fancy Curves", a sports reel from 1931 (judging from the Roman numerals used in the copyright notice) starting the legend Babe Ruth teaching women how to play the American pastime. A very interesting sports reel indeed, esp. seeing the legend himself in action.Since 1st watching this a couple of years ago, it has became one of my favorites, & I'm not a big movie person. This film should appear to both baseball & non-baseball fans alike

$REVIEW.: This is a film that inspires one to conduct their business and financial affairs with integrity. It reminds me of a story in the Bible where this tax collected indicated to Jesus that he would return double to all that he had swindled. At that statement, Jesus then proclaimed that salvation had come to that household. In this film Jay, decides to pay back the over-priced portion of the price to the owners of cars that he swindled them with in his dealings. The responses from the used car purchasers were really hilarious.So although Jay was going to church, he was really 'robbing' God as well as his customers. But at some point, he gets serious with God and stops the financial underhandedness.Salvation really then comes to his business and his family. This is a great family film that will inspire businessmen to be financially straight with God and with their fellowman

With its splendid pedigree of actors retained, there is no lack of effort on their part but even the excellent cast cannot not fix a script/direction that is sorely lacking in most all aspects and one which renders every situation as contrived and insipid. It would have been wonderful to experience a continuation of all the heartwarming aspects of the first series but this particular rendition falls dismally short.

$REVIEW.: When approaching a direct-to-DVD thriller, it's best to have limited expectations
Sometimes you may be pleasantly surprised, and sometimes you discover a film much more inept than you had anticipated
In the case of "The Con Artist," I found the title to be the cleverest thing about the film

You see, the titular lead is both an ex-convict and an aspiring sculptor--a literal con artist

However, with such a name, one might also expect a tidy and twisty film dealing with double-crosses and schemes

In the strictest sense, "The Con Artist" has nothing to do with that other definition of con
In fact, it straddles its time between an elite art milieu and a low level criminal enterprise while being completely unconvincing in both environments

Billed as a hip comedy, however, most of the chuckles provided were of a completely unintentional nature
I guess I must not be hip enough!Perhaps the biggest draw of the film is to see Donald Sutherland pair off with his son Rossif


The younger Sutherland plays the lead character who begins the movie being released from prison
Wanting to start life afresh, he gets drawn back into illegal activity by his former crime boss (the elder Sutherland)
Apparently and inexplicably successful, this band of inept hooligans seem to make most of their money on stealing cars

But for this to be a major plot point, you'll be amazed at the junky mid-range cars that qualify as theft-worthy! Any actual criminal activity documented is patently ridiculous
I especially loved the trick where they gummed some sort of money to the asphalt in a vacant lot, waited for a driver to come by and notice it, and when he got completely out of the car--they snuck up behind him to drive off in the vehicle
Genius! Criminal masterminds!But that's not the worst of it, our young hero also has a thoroughly unbelievable accident with a successful gallery owner played by Rebecca Romijn

(Off topic, and back to cars, why does she drive a dilapidated muscle car if she's a hotshot in the art world? Oh well.) She sees the one sculpture he has made and is convinced of his genius
Soon he's off to preposterous gallery shows and exhibits as well as swanky parties--and none of these sets is the least bit believable as upscale
The only art collector showcased is and over-the-top Greg Germann playing a walking cliche


His piece sells to Germann who commissions another one, and before you know it--the con artist has the central spot in an upcoming influential show (even though he has no other art and he is unaware of it a week prior to the event) as well as the cover article in a local paper (again, he's completely unaware of it--must be a great piece)!It's all silly enough as our young hero is torn between both worlds as well as a strangely antiseptic romance


Of course, you know these separate lives will converge for a big finale
But those waiting for the film to redeem itself with an exciting conclusion will again be left scratching their heads at how many lapses of logic were necessary to pull this unsatisfying story to a close
SPOILER ALERT!!! The thrilling conclusion and epic final crime is to steal about six cars from a valet service
I usually don't like to reveal major plot spoilers, but this one was priceless in how absolutely underwhelming it was

All in all, I can't recommend the film (although I liked Romijn's go-for-broke zeal)


Rossif Sutherland has potential, but I'd suggest he doesn't lead with this on his resume
KGHarris, 6/11.

$REVIEW.: Quirky.Unconventional.But it works.Will Farrell, showing that he has dramatic range, gives maybe the most impressive performance of his career.  His character, Harold Crick, a stiff, lifeless, almost robotic IRS agent, comes to life as he falls in love with a bohemian baker, Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal.)  Emma Thompson is believable as a neurotic but brilliant novelist suffering from writer's block.  Dustin Hoffman carries water as a literature professor who helps Harold figure out what is happening to him.  There's not a bad performance in the film.You will see the outcome from a mile away.  Or at least you think you can.  There's enough doubt about which way the story's going to keep your attention.Stranger Than Fiction is very funny but not in the way that most Hollywood "comedies" are.  It's full of off-beat humor a la Rushmore.  Don't rent (or buy) it expecting Old School or anything like Will's Saturday Night Live bits.  The humor's more subtle than that.Besides being unique - the story is a breath of fresh air given that Hollywood only seems to excel these days at remaking old movies and TV shows - it is beautifully filmed.  One of the most enjoyable aspects, for me, of this movie is that it was shot right in downtown Chicago.  There's a lot of life and art - beautiful architecture and urban landscapes - in the setting.  The GUI (graphic user interface) bits give the film another visual dimension.All in all, Stranger Than Fictions' a nice movie.  If there are flaws they are that the story slows in spots and that the connection between Harold and Ana is a little hard to swallow.  Nevertheless, it's one of the more interesting movies to come out of Hollywood in the last few years.

$REVIEW.: "Silver Linings Playbook" is a romantic dramedy adapted from the book of the same name by Matthew Quick. David O. Russell wrote the screenplay and directs. Pat Solitano, Jr. (Bradley Cooper) has just been released from a psychiatric hospital, where he spent some time after severely beating his wife's lover. He immediately vows to win back the affections of his estranged wife Nikki, against the advice of his bookmaking father (Robert De Niro) and headstrong mother (Jackie Weaver). When Pat is introduced to Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), the sister of a friend, sparks fly, as she is recently widowed with some problems of her own. Tiffany proposes that she help Pat contact Nikki -if he will be her competitive dance partner in return.David O. Russell chose this material, because it made mental illness, specifically bipolar disorder, accessible. And Pat is not the only one afflicted. Tiffany dealt with her husband's death with pathological behavior. Pat's father has a minor obsessive-compulsive disorder. Danny (Chris Tucker), a friend from the hospital, has drug problems and a constant battle over the legal status of his hospitalization. It's a menagerie of personality problems. I'm not sure that any of these characters are quite believable, but the film doesn't try to pass dysfunction off as quirkiness, a common ploy in independent film. It takes a matter-of-fact but sympathetic approach to the characters' problems. Pat's struggle to deal with his impulses makes him sympathetic.The film glosses over, or even advocates, some very bad behavior, however. Pat is bipolar, but Tiffany's problems are more troubling. Tiffany reacts to situations in which she feels uncomfortable by accusing innocent men of sexual harassment. She does this once and alludes to it a second time. She repeatedly lies to Pat about things that are important to him and sees nothing wrong with toying with others' emotions for her own gratification. None of this is presented in a negative light. In fact, we are supposed to celebrate Tiffany's self-acceptance. But making unfounded accusations is not acceptable. Jennifer Lawrence is an appealing actress, and that white-washes the character. She makes Tiffany's frankness seem charming, which it is in some contexts, but Tiffany has no concept of right and wrong, and she doesn't have psychosis to blame. She's the last person with whom a bipolar individual should be involved.The DVD (Anchor Bay 2013): Bonus features include 17 deleted scenes. There is a meandering featurette called "Silver Linings Playbook: The Movie That Became a Movement" (29 min), which features interviews with director David O. Russell, author Matthew Quick, the cast, some psychiatrists, and composer Danny Elfman. "Dance Rehearsal" (1:30 min) is a brief snippet, and "Going Steadicam with Bradley Cooper" (1 min) is also a snippet of someone filming Cooper experimenting with a Steadicam. Those last two are not worthwhile. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish. Dubbing is available in French.

$review_text.: Watch HOME ALONE (1990) and HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK (1992) on consecutive nights, and you will experience the ultimate deja vu sensation.  The second film is not a sequel, but a remake with an improved screenplay!  Both movies were directed by Chris Columbus and written/produced by John Hughes.  Film one takes place mostly in the Chicago suburbs at Christmas time--and did the production designers ever have a fun time hanging lights all over three story mansions.  The second film takes place in mostly New York City, also at Christmas time.  Both movies have clips from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946)--one in French, the other in Spanish.  And both have the identical clip from the fictional ANGELS WITH FILTHY SOULS that are used for similar purposes--to scare away unwanted people.  Finally, both have young hero Kevin McAllister (amazing Macaulay Culkin) taking on the same two burglars and just about killing them.  One wonders how on earth Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern (and the stunt people) survived the stunts in both films.The plots are shamelessly similar.  In film one, Kevin is left at home in his family's elegant Chicago suburbs mansion, while everyone else in the family goes to Paris.  Once in Paris, once mom Catherine O'Hara (wonderful) realizes Kevin is alone, she tries to bribe and cajole passengers to be bumped so that she can get back home right away.  But Kevin is having the time of his life alone with ice cream and cheese pizzas--and having a field day fighting off the Laurel and Hardy-like "Wet Bandit" burglars Pesci and Stern.  Helping him is a next door neighbor everyone is afraid of, Roberts Blossom, who has the film's most poignant scene with Kevin in an empty church on Christmas Eve.  John Candy is also wonderful as a polka king who helps O'Hara get to Chicago from, I think, Milwaukee in his band's van.Just as the best scenes in HOME ALONE involve a lonely old man and a polka band, and not the burglars, the burglars are downright irrelevant in LOST IN NEW YORK.  Here the family flies to Miami, leaves Kevin behind in Chicago again, and he ends up alone at the Plaza Hotel with all of Manhattan at Christmas time as his playground.  I like film two much better because of the sublime supporting cast:  Brenda Fricker as a Central Park bird woman, Eddie Bracken as a toy store manager, Tim Curry as a hotel concierge with a grinch smile, and John Schneider as a bellboy who goes crazy with a kid who alternately gives him bubble gum and $50 tips.  (Kevin has his Dad's credit card--up to a point.)  They are so hysterically funny for 90 minutes that it is almost a letdown when burglars Pesci and Stern, still playing "The Wet Bandits", show up to menace Kevin in an upper Manhattan brownstone for the last half hour of a long 120 minutes.  Again, I found myself cringing at the realistic and nasty violence, more than laughing at its inventiveness.  I found myself really fearing for actors' and stuntpeoples' lives.  I NEVER FOUND IT FUNNY.  But I adored the ending with mom Catherine O'Hara sweetly reunited with Kevin at Rockefeller Center.  (You just knew it would end that way.)It's Christmas season.  You are busy with your own families and holiday shopping. You have time for one of the first two (there are four total) HOME ALONE movies from John Hughes and Chris Columbus.  Watch film two, LOST IN NEW YORK.  Savor the fabulous supporting cast and the gorgeous color by master cinematographer Julio Macat (who also shot the first film in ravishing deep oranges and greens).  John Williams' score on both films is special, too, as always.  Happy holiday season.

$review_text.: This movie is intense, but NOT in a &#34;slasher/horror movie&#34; way that devalues the subject matter.  Very well done.  Illustrates the sad world we live in but still leave a sense of hope and how ordinary people can be heroic.
$SUMMARY.: Intense, but very well done.

$review_text.: Back in the mid 60's to early 70's, Amicus Productions (The Studio That Dripped Blood) rivaled the famous Hammer Studios and its' horror films, and the releases from the two English studios were often confused as they often used many of the same actors and directors.  Amicus Productions was most famous for its' creepy horror anthologies, including The House that Dripped Blood (1970), Tales from the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1974), and From Beyond the Grave (1975).  Amicus, formed by a partnership between producers Milton Subotsky and Max J. Rosenberg, dissolved in the mid 70's, as did Amicus Productions.  While many fans mourned the passing of this wonderful and short-lived institution, Subotosky did go on to form Sword and Sorcery Productions, which released The Monster Club (1980), bringing back some of the magic of a time since past.Directed by Roy Ward Baker, who also did Asylum and The Vault of Horror, along with numerous Hammer films, The Monster Club, based on a book by famed and prolific author R. Chetwynd-Hayes boasts a plethora of stars including Vincent Price, John Carradine, Donald Pleasance, Britt Ekland, Stuart Whitman, and Patrick Magee, among others.  There are three stories here, loosely tied together with a wrap-around story and a number of musical performances (B.A. Robertson is great performing 'Sucker for Your Love'), all wonderful in their own right.The film starts off with the wrap-around story, as we meet a character named after the author of the book the film is based on, R. Chetwynd-Hayes (Carradine) being approached by a man looking for a bite, as he hasn't eaten in a couple of weeks.  Chetwynd-Hayes offers assistance in the form of money, but the man, named Eramus (Price) isn't speaking of eating in the normal sense, as he's a vampire and takes some of Chetwynd-Hayes blood, but not to the point where he infects the author.  Learning of the man's identity and feeling a debt of gratitude is due, Eramus offers to take Chetwynd-Hayes to a exclusive club, a sort of monster disco, where monsters reside, allowing for the author to gather new material for a future book.  After some tongue-in-cheek humor, we are treated to three tales of varying degrees of horror.The first tale involves couple, George and Angela, of dubious nature looking for their next scheme, and it comes in the form of a position cataloging antiquities for a odd looking man named Raven who rarely leaves his large and expansive estate.  Angela applies, but soon balks as she has great apprehension about the man, given his strange appearance.  George talks her into going back, and she assumes the position.  He seems nice enough, despite his ghoulish appearance, and he certainly has a tempting amount of valuables ripe for the taking.  Raven soon becomes enamored with Angela and proposes marriage, to which George sees as a perfect opportunity to have access to Raven's wealth.  Well, things soon sour, and we learn Raven is much more than an odd-looking fellow, possessing an interesting method of dealing with those who anger him.The second story deals with a shy, young boy and his parents, to which the father has a job that requires him to stay out all night, and sleep during the day.  Also, the boy learns that he's descended from noble lineage, his father being a count.  Can you guess where this is leading?  Anyway, not to give too much away, the story deals with vampires and vampires hunters, and actually is the more humorous, despite its' dour beginnings, of the three tales, providing a couple of nice twists at the end.  This story stars Britt Ekland and Donald Pleasance.The third story tells a tale of a director named Sam (Whitman) scouting locations for a new horror film, looking for a village with lots and lots of atmosphere, which he finds, but soon regrets.  The village, populated by ghouls, has plans for Sam, and they don't involve making a movie.  Sam finds assistance in the form of a girl, and both take refuge in an abandoned church, where Sam learns the awful history of the village, and how it came to such a state that it's in now.  Do Sam and the girl manage an escape?  Maybe they do, maybe they don't...you'll just have to watch.  This tale has the strongest horror element, and a really wonderful, thick, brooding sense of atmosphere.  Reminds me a little of a film Vincent Price did back in the day called The Last Man on Earth (1964).Pathfinder Home Entertainment provides a pretty good wide screen, non-anamorphic print here, which does show minor speckling and occasional murkiness, to which we learn that this was the only print available to them with a on-screen note prior to the beginning of the film.  As far as special features go, there are a ton of them.  There's a complete musical soundtrack, with the ability to listen to any song from the movie, and there's a lot, with artists like The Pretty Things, UB40, B.A. Robertson, and The Viewers, to name a few.  There's also a separate commentary by film critics Luke Y. Thompson and Gregory Weinkauf, a theatrical trailer for the film, detailed biographies of most of the films stars, extensive production notes, original press notes, a photo still gallery, essays by film critic George Reis and, a bit by Vincent Price and his views on horror movies in general, and even a hidden feature accessed by clicking on the doctor's stomach in the special features menu.  All in all, this is a great little horror anthology infused with a good dose of silly humor, one that fans of the long gone but not forgotten Amicus films will enjoy.  But be warned, as the real horror doesn't come until the end, when Vincent Price and John Carradine proceed to get 'jiggy' with it on the dance floor.Cookieman108

$REVIEW.: I went into this show expecting a standard police procedural that just happened to have David Tennant in it. Boy, was I taken by surprise.Focusing around the murder of an 11-year-old boy in a quiet sea-side town, Broadchurch follows not only the investigation into the boy's death, but the fallout to the entire community. A media circus ensues, and mob-mentality leads to further revelations and consequences.The show starts slow, reminiscent of the heavy focus on the anguish over Laura Palmer's murder in the first episode of &#34;Twin Peaks&#34;, but as the investigation continues, the time spent with all of these characters really pays off and allows us to be invested in their stories. By the time the season ends, it's hard not to feel something for everyone involved, which is lost in a lot of procedurals thanks to the standard 1-case-1-episode format that has characters coming and going all of the time. Here, we're living with these people for all 8 episodes. We know them. And we suspect everyone.David Tennant is great here, although written somewhat cliche as the gruff detective with a guilty secret seeking redemption. He gives his character some great (and much needed) humor as his out-of-touch-overtly-serious character is at odds with everyone, even/especially our other protagonist, Olivia Coleman's DS Miller. He really is an amazing actor, and he elevates what would have probably been an abrasive and annoying archetype otherwise.Coleman is the real star of this show. Her character is the emotional backbone of the series, as we see her initially naive and trusting nature (a product of the &#34;perfect sleepy town&#34; mentality) continually challenged by the revelations of the investigation. She's a detective who's never had to deal with investigating a murder, let alone the son of a dear friend. She knows the killer will be someone she knows, and that fear is gut-wrenching.No spoilers, but the story is surprising. Thankfully the plot doesn't revolve around a huge twist, but suffice to say it isn't predictable in the slightest.I'll stop there. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a more dramatic and emotional investigative drama than the average show. I'll just warn that it's very heavy, despite the occasional funny bickering between Tennant and Coleman, and is not for anyone looking for a &#34;fun&#34; show.

$REVIEW.: The son of a great fighter who did not wish for his child to follow in his footsteps, the bullied Huo Yuanjia resolves to teach himself how to fight--and win. Years of training enable him to ace match after match in his home region of Tianjin. But as his fame as a martial arts master grows, so does his pride. After an ill-advised fight leads to another master's death, members of Huo's family are slain in revenge. Grieving and ashamed, Huo wanders the country in shock. Near death, he is rescued by women from an idyllic village, and is offered simple kindness and generosity that help him heal and regain his equilibrium over a period of several years. Huo realizes that the future of martial arts lies in sportsmanship and not brutality, and he rejoins society to apply what he has learned. Returning to Tianjin, Huo takes steps to come to terms with his past and restore his family's name. His evolving, graceful Mizong (Missing) Fist method of fighting brings Huo renewed success, and he forms the progressive Jingwu Sports Federation. Taking note, duplicitous members of the Foreign Chamber of Commerce engineer a Shanghai tournament pitting Huo against four fighters, each representing the major foreign powers in China. Huo commits to the bout and faces off against, respectively, a British boxer, a Spanish swordsman, a Belgian soldier and a Japanese martial artist. What happened that day in 1910 has never been, and will never be, forgotten in China. This movie achieves a way to balance story and philosophy just like his last great film Hero.

$REVIEW.: I bought this movie without knowing much about the story, it was really the fact I was looking for a new holiday season movie and the actors seemed appealing. Overall I enjoyed this movie, while it was a little slow to start up and the story seemed a little disjointed at times, I still got into it. It did sort of end a bit briefly which was disappointing but it is a chickflick so you know from early on how it will end. Overall a good movie, likeable characters, a story that many people could relate to as far as judging parents are concerned and a bit of romance thrown in for good luck...I would watch it again!

Dudley Moore is hilarious and the Villians are all suitably sinister. Watch for the Martial Arts fight with Burgess Meredith and Rachel Roberts (she's one tough mumma).Oh and Goldie is as cute as always !!

$REVIEW.: The Rules of Attraction is a poor movie of a story told poorly.  In my eyes, this movie has no value whatsoever.The &quot;backwards&quot; sequences are neither creative nor fun to watch.  (Twin Peaks did something like that years ago...and did it better)  The story is so thin, it's almost nonexistant.  What little plot there is doesn't make this movie worth seeing.Movies can be good or even great for many reasons.  Cinemotography can be breathtaking, stories can be awesome, acting can be brilliant...Rules of Attraction has none of these attributes.  Movies can survive poor stories and other problems if the viewer is left feeling uplifted or educated or emotionally connected to a character...this movie does none of this.Finally, when I'm at a loss to explain the existance of a movie, I ask myself two questions...1.  Am I better off in anyway for seeing this movie?  2.  Are the characters in the movie better off for living through the story that was told...did they learn anything?  The answer to both questions is NO.

$review_text.: Others have been very efficient at noting which cartoons are included, and several have mentioned the important information that "Digitally re-mastered" doesn't mean the same thing as "restored". I've always been a fan of the later "Woody's" so for me this collection was an essential buy. But what I thought was most intriguing was the additional bonus features, extensive and informative tutorials about the inner workings of the studio, hosted by Walter Lantz. These were a terrific exploration of old-fashioned cartoon production, and were a great instructional guide to those who have an interest. Some of the early Fleischer compilations have fascinating documentaries, but the special features here are worth the price of the set, and the cartoons "Alley to Bali" and "Under the Counter Spy" are wonderful shorts to own for collectors.

$REVIEW.: ROBOCOP: Five starsROBOCOP is a modern science fiction masterpiece. The future is not black and white, as most sci-fi tales conform to. It is a utopia of white-teeth propaganda but its black tarred heart beats a dystopian horror. ROBOCOP has been misunderstood simply as an eighties violent action picture. It is a lot more than that.Firstly, integral satire thumps hard at its core - big business is the new `democracy' (or lack of) and money is God. Falling human values and decency are humorously mocked (the family playing the `nuke' game) and the price of human life is devalued.Robocop is a sort of iron messiah, almost Christ-like - for example, he is a morally strong man, gunned down doing something he believed in, was `resurrected' and eventually became an iconic figure for hope in a city falling into apathetic hell and crime.The film is extremely violent, but it never seems gratuitously (there for the sake of it). The violence highlights the cold heartless vision of the future that our future relatives will inevitably inherit (are we not too far off now from that dystopia?) I saw this film on British television years ago, with censored `television-friendly' cuts. This made the film feel subdued in its message, and it lacked the brutal force of the uncut version (even the cutting of swear words gave the film a less realistic, less-grimmer feel).Peter Weller is an inspired choice for the dual role of Officer Murphy (married family man, nice suburban home) and his resurrected entity - Robocop. The armour suit is brilliantly created, and seems well ahead of its time - example the gun holster in his leg (this is pre-CGI). Nancy Allen, plays his bolshy side-kick who also holds a high moral compass.The stop-motion animation seems a tad dated (ED-209 falling down the stairs for example) even though it was made in 1987, but the sets are well-made and the difference between the urban decay below and the modern settings of the OCP buildings are well contrasted (the office buildings are grey and colourless, devoid of any human touches or character).The intertwining news features, and faux advertisements, satirise a scrupulous modern media relationship with the `consumer'.Apparently, Paul Verhoeven wanted a futuristic city created (see Starship Troopers) but budget restrictions forced him to settle for modern day looking Dallas. This works well in Verhoeven's favour, as the city feels deprived and the overall feeling is that this bleak future is not too far off.The sequels and the TV spin-off (aimed at kids!), fortunately, does not devalue this movie, as this film stands alone. Some say it is the greatest sci-fi to come out of the eighties, I think it is the best to come out ever (alongside Metropolis, Terminator, Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey), though people who think its gory violence is unnecessary, will disagree.ROBOCOP 2: Three starsThe inevitable sequel is not as bad as some make out; though, compared with the original, it fails on all levels. Released with a surge of hype in 1989, this will fill only those who saw the first as a violent action picture, rather than the layered modern sci-fi it really is.It's portrayal of a new drug culture offers nothing new, and seems pretty lazy and easy as a purpose to satirise. The villain, Cain, a sort of hippy throwback, seems a bit too much of a `superhero' villain (i.e. wacky, unconventional) to offer any gritty realism (unlike the first). Irvin Kershner, the director who gave us the most fulfilling Star Wars episode - The Empire Strikes Back, seems to lack the social and political bite that Verhoeven created with the first movie.However, if you see the film in the right light - as a comic-book style movie, then ROBOCOP 2 is elevated somewhat. There are parts when satire does sparkle, for example, where Robocop/Murphy is `reprogrammed' and set back out onto the streets is a vicious swipe at OTT political correctness and liberalism (as the first movie took a swipe at conservatism and big business fascism).The violence is not as brutal and realistic as the first one, but it is still far off the `children' friendly Robocop spin-offs that follow this movie.News bulletins and faux advertisements return, but this time they feel too absurd, and instead of satirising modern western media, it simply parodies the first film.I would rate this film three stars.ROBOCOP 3: One starIf the second Robocop movie has some redeemable features, then the third instalment has hardly any. This film is the metamorphous of the Robocop franchise into a kid's marketed commodity. In this respect, this film seems to be a pilot for the children-friendly television series that soon followed (though this film is not be confused WITH the television show pilot).The violence is low key and the inclusion of a child actor as one of the main central characters seems to confirm this. Maybe this was the inevitable conclusion - Robocop has all the hallmarks of a `superhero' and the commercialisation of this towards the children's toy market/comics may gather a new audience (young viewers) but will alienate an older audience at the same time. The superhero theme is cemented with Robocop's new jetpack and the `ninja' style villains (this movie was released when the ninja turtles franchise was in full swing).It is ironic that this film should be included to make the series a `trilogy'. Parents who have seen this movie - and the television series - may find the first two films a total shock.The film also lacks the budget of the first two movies, which was a surprise as Robocop 3 was very hyped up to its confusing release date (set back time after time with delays) and was released in Britain straight-to-video.This film can be viewed as a pilot, of the pilot of the tv series. Parents who wish to buy this trilogy because of Robocop's `revamp' into a children's `action figure' toy may have an unpleasant surprise with the first two movies, so I suggest buying Robocop 3 on its own.
