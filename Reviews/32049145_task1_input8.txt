$REVIEW.: Sharp's LC-60SQ15U is a 1080p 60" 3D LED TV that accepts 4k input despite the 1920 x 1080 resolution.  Despite the Full HD resolution, 4k inputs don't entirely go to waste thanks to the extra sub-pixels.  Other HDTV's have three sub-pixels per pixel: red, green and blue.  The Aquos Q+ display adds another color (yellow) and doubles up the sub-pixels for a total of eight.  This gives the display 16 million sub-pixels vs. 6 million for a standard Full HD layout.  While the Q+ display benefits most from 4k inputs (which are hard to come by), the TV can up-convert lower resolutions and the results are noticeably better up close.  I have the 60 inch, but I imagine the 70 inch would benefit even more.Regardless of Q+, the picture quality is excellent.  The color accuracy is on target, despite my initial concerns over the yellow sub-pixel causing issues.  The picture controls make it easy to calibrate using a colorimeter or roughly by eye.  The end results are impressive with the only minor negatives being mediocre viewing angle, a little spotlighting near the corners and a black level that is commendable but short of the best. The game mode was closest to my final settings, with the dynamic modes being quite far off.  Game mode works quite well to eliminate lag, naturally lacks the motion-correction options available in the other modes.  The motion-correction works well, without too much soap-opera effect using the 120 frame low correction setting.The body is all-plastic and relatively thick for tv's these days, but that helps accommodate better performing components, so I don't mind.  The bezel is reasonably thin and the TV is relatively light for its size, making it easy enough for me to assemble by myself (results may vary).  There are plenty of inputs, including a plug for ethernet (wi-fi also built in).  Apps are available for most streaming services though Amazon is oddly missing from the lineup.  Sound is bearable and about what I expected - thin, a bit harsh and little bass.  Definitely go with external speakers.

$review_text.: I have been thinking of getting a new MP3 player for a while now


 I don't need video (I don't like watching video on a 2 inch screen, I think a lot of people think they need this feature and just end up listening to music anyway), so I just wanted something small that sounds good, well this is it!  I bought the 2 Gb model and holds more than enough music for me (it charges off the USB slot on the computer anyway so its no big deal to add or take something off the player once in a while for new music)
 I had an older sandisk mp3 player and it worked fine but this one just sounds so much better


 I have a decent pair of ear buds(Sennheiser CX300)and I am knocked out by the quality this thing puts out, sounds great when plugged into the input on my car stereo too

 No extra software to install, plug it in and Media Player 11 recognized it right away, super easy to add music
 Easy to use and you will be listening to high quality music in minutes
 Very small, light and the clip is very handy, display is easy to read in all light conditions


 This is a great buy.

$review_text.: I am simply amazed at this tripod.  Packs up into a small space (backpack-sized), lightweight, but still sturdy and quickly expands to full height.  This is the kind of tripod you could take with you on hikes if you're serious about your photos, without feeling like you're really packing anything extra or letting things get out of hand.  Feels well made for a medium-duty tripod, and I expect to get a lot of great use out of it.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this item in August, and have been using it since. For some reason, mine came with two covers in the package, which is the only reason I am not giving it a lower rating. While it looks great for the first few weeks, it gradually builds up a residue of some kind on it that does not come off with any cleaner or soap I tried, and it also discolored, developing a yellowish tinge. I suppose that could be the result of my attempts to clean it, but I feel it's worth mentioning.Earlier this month I finally tossed the first one and am using the 2nd one that was in the package, but it too is already starting to develop the finger spot residue that won't come off. I suppose that in another few months I'll be forced to buy another keyboard cover, so unless you are comfortable buying again every 5 months or so I would suggest another cover to begin with.

$review_text.: I have tested many different desktop computer speakers. In my opinion the best is the JBL Duet system, which retails for around half the price of these speakers. These speakers are good but they really aren't great.Pros: They look great, have good bass, and if you are on the other end of a room they fill the room up well.Cons: Treble not great. It's not as bad as some computer speakers but not as good as many other either. As I said they fill a room up well but if you are right in front of them they sound off kilter unless you position yourself exactly in the middle of them. Last but certainly not least, my biggest issue with these speakers: too much bass. They sound like they have a third subwoofer stuffed in there somewhere. Now, for some people this may be a selling point. For me, however, I bought a set of two small tabletop speakers because I didn't want the boom of the subwoofer. I want a little bit of bass but not a subwoofer's worth. These pack a subwoofer's worth, and you have to use a manual software EQ from your computer to adjust it lower; there is no bass or treble adjustment on the speakers themselves. Again, this is probably great for a lot of people but I don't like booming bass when I'm listening to Neil Young or the Beatles.Bottom line, these are just good. They are not great in any sense that I can discern. Also, they are overpriced because of the BOSE name on the front. These are not worth $100. More like $40. I would take a serious look at the JBL Duet and I will probably be returning these to get a set of Duets again.
$SUMMARY.: Good, but not great.

$review_text.: after watching the YouTube video and reading the instructions, I still had 3 significant sized bubbles appear. The film is a VERY tight fit, which I love, however, there is NO room for error, and if you are off even a few degrees, as I was, when aligning the bottom, by the time I got to the top, the film was covering the camera lens a bit. I had to un peel, and restart 3 times, and finally got it aligned correctly, and most likely the re tries are what enabled the dust to create the for mentioned bubbles. Cant really blame the maker, as they do provide significant instructions, just a warning to those that buy, that even in a completely cleaned area like I had, make sure you are aligned perfectly, or you will either end up with bubbles, or having to use 1 of the 2 remaining covers.Having said all that, these covers are really nice and nearly invisible. They don't seem to pick up finger prints like other covers I have purchased, and for the price, these are definitely worth the purchase.

$REVIEW.: Okay, so two disclaimers: first, I got this free through the Vine program


 Second, I am an absolute amateur photographer

 I don't even have a DSLR


 (Just got a Kodak Z990, looking at a DSLR maybe for Christmas).My only experience with a tripod is with the Vanguard Nivelo 245BK, which is a great little tripod
 Well, this Abeo 323CB is a great BIG tripod


 For such a monster, holy cow, is this thing easy to use


 It literally takes seconds to set it up, even though when it's fully extended, it's over 6 feet tall
 Each leg can be locked at a different angle (or a different length), there's a level so you can see how close you are to actually being straight, and the middle column swings either up or down, depending on whether you need height or if you need to get close to a small object.To top it off, it's not even very heavy - just about 7 pounds

 My camera is almost that heavy!So while I'm an amateur, I really can't imagine a better tripod than this

 Highly recommended.

Then problems started: Got email quickly but opening email hung unit up; when I tried access to regular website frequently visited it hung up again; then the whole OS froze. Everything I tried, pushing on/off button, touching every icon at top of the screen did nothing. So I contacted [...] for support, 51 minutes later I got the tech. Had to remove back of unit to unplug battery; did this three time but the unit never did turn on again. I was really looking forward to having a reader with wifi capability. Problem with online hang ups was Droid's OS problem with Flash ....this conclusion by service tech. Only workaround was to get a "beta" app that helped to resolve the problem with Flash. Purchased from HSN, but TV Ad said nothing about Flash incompatibility. Returning it tomorrow!

$REVIEW.: I bought the Clearstream 2 with the indoor mounting kit (base, pole, cover) for my daughter's college apartment in Chapel Hill, NC.  She is about 34 miles from the transmitting tower  for the major stations.  Unfortunately, her apartment and windows face the opposite direction from the tower.  I figured that if she had any chance to receive anything, it would require a larger antenna. (The Clearstream2 has dual elements, and is about the largest indoor antenna you can buy.)  I hooked it up and did a channel scan and was amazed.  All of the channels locked in. It took a lot of playing around, but I finally put it on a shelf in her closet, facing through the wall.  Oddly enough, it's not pointed in the direction of the stations, but at a 90 degree angle.  I suspect that it is picking up a reflection, but it doesn't matter.  The stations come in great.  I was especially surprised how well it picked up RF channel 11 (the only high band VHF station in the market). The only downside was its size, significantly larger than other indoor types.It's always better to have an outdoor antenna, and one pointed directly at your target stations.  However, for anyone in an apartment who can't mount one outside, the Clearstream2 is an excellent choice for an indoor solution, provided that you are comfortable with its size.  If the CS2 won't pick your station(s) up, then no other indoor antenna will.  If you order the CS2 for indoor use, be sure to get the one that has the pole and the base.

$REVIEW.: I bought this SD card back in August 2011 when Amazon had the 1 day Gold Box deal on this card.  I have used Kingston cards in the past (up to 2 GB SD cards) and didn't have any problems.  I came back from my 12-day European trip a few days ago and found out that 3 pictures and 1 video is corrupted (I took about 1000 pictures/videos).  During my trip, I encountered "memory card error" several times on my digital camera and I had to turn my camera off and then on to get it to work.  I have tried to fix/recover those pictures/videos but have had no luck.  I will not use this card for future vacation trips--I will only use it to playback pics/videos on my digital picture frame because I don't want to go through the frustration of finding out pics/videos I take during vacation might be corrupt.  I think I will look for deals on SanDisk Extreme SDHC cards for my next vacation trip...

$review_text.: This is for people (like me) who've never done this before... I use Windows Vista and an HP desktop computer.1. Ordered this drive, which arrived promptly. Drive was well packed with foam. As expected, it didn't come with anything else. It works fine, and to me it doesn't seem noisy.2. Ordered Tripp Lite P940-19I Serial ATA (SATA) Signal Cable (19 Inches). Note: older computers won't support SATA. If you have a newer computer, it should work. SATA cables are red and about 1 cm wide, the older cables are about an inch wide and silvery. If your hard drive uses these, don't get this drive.3. Ordered Tripp Lite P946-12I Serial ATA (SATA) Dual Power Adapter Cable - 4pin/2x15pin SATA - 12in. This is a "Y" adapter (optimistically planning for my next hard drive!), but a straight one would also work. I found out after it arrived I already had a SATA power adapter in my case. However, it wouldn't have reached with the available wiring length, so I still ended up using this.4. In my case, the drive requires 4 screws to install it. These are short screws with large flat heads, the heads form a sort of "rail" for it to glide into the rack on. On opening my case, I realized that HP had thoughtfully provided extra screws for future upgrades! The drive does not come with screws.5. Installed drive in rack, plugged in the two cables, no problem.6. Get to Windows. Your new hardware icon should say "locating... installing" or something like that.7. Go to Start-Computer (right click on Computer) - Manage - then to Disk Management. Find your new drive at the bottom of the screen, and click over the "drive 1" (or whatever) designation to make it "online". Then right click the long color band over the drive's partition graphic and start the "new simple volume" wizard. Stayed with the defaults.That's about it, everything worked the first time. After the drive was up and running, I decided to error-check the drive from Windows Explorer (under the tools tab for drive). This gave the unexpected result of giving me a blank screen for several hours while it checked it. When I've error-checked drive c:\, my screen gives me information on what it's doing. This was just totally blank, which was disconcerting, but in a few hours it finished what it was doing and everything worked.I also went into the BIOS on bootup (pressed F10 while booting, don't know if this is the same on other PC's) to see if I needed to do anything there, but I didn't. The new drive was already listed. I did get a new option on booting, to set up the drive in a RAID configuration, I left this alone. (non-RAID)This is written to help first-timers like me. If any experienced computer folks want to comment and add pearls of wisdom feel free!Update: July 26, 2012Three plus years later, lots of usage, working fine, no problems.

After electricity was lost for a day or two the sump pumps stopped working and water rose above the camera height.This camera is located at shore house that we had to evacuate. I know how far the water came up because of the water line that was on the concrete walls in the basement.I am Amazed to report that the camera was not damaged by the water.The camera is still working perfectly 1 month after being submerged in water.I'd like to hear back from Loftek with any comments they may have.How is this possible....  THIS CAMERA IS EASY TO SET UP IF YOU HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE ON SETTING UP PORT FORWARDING ON YOUR ROUTER.THE ROUTER ALSO GIVES YOU ITS OWN IP ADDRESS THAT YOU NEED TO ACCESS IT FROM THE INTERNET.  DON'T USE PORT 80 OR 25,SINCE SOME ISP'S BLOCK PORT 80 AND 25. YOU CAN PUT IN, FOR EXAMPLE, PORT 85 IN THE PORT FORWARD TABLE. ALSO, AFTER YOU DO THE "AUTO IP ADDRESS CONF" VIA THE CD THAT IS SUPPLIED WITH THE CAMERA,RECORD THE IP ADDRESS THAT THE ROUTER ASSINED TO THE CAMERA AND ENTER THIS IP ADDRESS INTO THE PORT FORWARD TABLE ALONG WITH PORT 85 AND CLICK SUBMIT.YOU NOW ARE ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE CAMERA VIA THE INTERNET.  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:85  The x is the Router ip address.

$REVIEW.: TDK Life on Record 77000015378 USB Belt Drive TurntableI am old enough to have a collection of 400 vinyl records and also a 25 year old turntable.  When I saw the opportunity to try out a modern turntable with USB connectivity, I jumped at the chance. My Technics SL-5 still works well and can serve as a comparison. It has no idea what USB is and we won't compare that feature to it.First, the packaging of the turntable is quite good. All the parts are secured in foam or boxes and well protected for transport. That said, there are a lot of parts and assembly is required.  No tools are needed but you will have to follow the directions carefully to get it all together and working. If you want an open the box and plug it in experience, this may not be for you.  In following the directions I found a slight error that may confuse some. In setting up and balancing the tone arm, the docs make not of the weight having a "3" marking. Well, there isn't. The markings start at zero "0" and circle around back to the zero where the 3 should be. Getting past that and continuing on the tone arm was relatively easy to balance and set to the required 3 grams, for the included cartridge. The 3 gram setting is the signature of a less than optimum cartridge. Get ready to spend more and get a cartridge needle combination with a less than one gram requirement. That will put your vinyl through less wear than the included one. Still, it's good enough to get you started. My Technics tracks at well under one gram.Now we get to the $100 upgrade of this player. The USB output and Cakewalk recording software. To say I am frustrated is an understatement. The software is far from Plug `n Play. It installed OK on my Windows 7 64 bit version. It just doesn't work very well. After much trial and error I was able to get one song recorded from an album. It only took three hours to accomplish that. There's no easy way to choose that you want to record from the player. It keeps finding other sources on my system to record from including my web-cam. I've gone through the help system and the web site, there's just not much there to help. This should be much easier, it is not.I consider myself fairly technical, yet I feel overwhelmed. This should be an easy item to setup and record from. Sadly it just isn't for a person who like me would have a vinyl collection they'd like to digitize. It will be nothing but a giant frustration. I will continue to fight with this thing and amend my review as I discover what is wrong and why it's so difficult to use. Maybe there will be a software update?

$REVIEW.: This review is for Case Logic TBC-302 case used with the Canon S95 camera. For reference I recently purchased this case along withOlympus Horizontal Neoprene and Nylon Case (Black)which I just reviewed here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R16VC0Y97PZV74.After spending several days with the 2 products I've come to admire each but for different reasons. While they both share similar qualities I admire:- Compact design- Belt loop mountable- Reasonably padded- Room for memory cardsSummarizing the specific pros and cons of the Case Logic:PROS:- Very compact with more conforming outer shell fits in pocket easier- Little roomier design accommodates camera & 2 memory cards with plastic cases- Vertically oriented when strapped on- Better secured zippered closures- Wide secure belt loop- Carabiner provides attachment flexibilityCONS:- Padding appears a little sparse- Carabiner loop attachment seems vulnerable- Confined space makes it difficult to store camera wrist strap- No space for battery (forget charger)While the Olympus has a number of pros and cons as well, its easy to wish for a product that combines the best of both. However, given the cost difference (neither can be considered expensive) both provide above average quality, design and features.It quickly boils down to personal preference: magnetic vs zipper fasteners; formal vs casual style; slightly thicker padding vs more conforming shell. Sometimes there are no clear choices and compromise and price being what they are I think I will end up using both depending on the situation.

$review_text.: I originally ordered this mount because when my projector is flipped upside down, the top of the image is projected straight across and I wanted to get it about 5-6" from the ceiling as I could (10 ft ceiling) since that is where I had placed my screen


What I didn't factor in was the living room ceiling fan, which was only in a corner of the image but VERY noticeable
So I wound up returning this one and going with this instead-Atdec TH-WH-PJ-CM Projector Ceiling Mountit has the same exact projector mount, but has the ceiling attachment plate and the extension arms


I used the shortest length possible with this and had to angle the projector a little to have it shoot at the right spot on my screen but it looks better attached to the ceiling rather than using the other mount or mounting to a shelf on the rear wall.The mount is strong and seems that it could hold a decently heavy projector very easily, so long as it is mounted correctly

Mine is only a couple of pounds so I didn't really test its weight capacity

But if you're on the fence on whether to get the one with the arm, go with the one with the arm.

$REVIEW.: The router itself is actually pretty nice little units, especially for the price.  Perfect for someone that wants a powerful router without getting into the router configuration much.I have three of them in use as a "guest" network where I work (1 as a Router/WAP and 2 additional units as WAPs only).  They were *HUGE* upgrades for the guest network and we saw immediate capactity improvements over our previous Linksys WRT54G units.  These routers can handle way more WiFi traffic without slowing down to a crawl.  As an example, we recently had a training school with 20 outside reps in attendence ... previously this was enough traffic to bring one of the WAPs to its knees ... but with these units in place we had no troubles at all!My main gripe is the firmware ... I had to make some tweaks to the packet size so that my iPhone would actually maintain a connection with these units.  The Web GUI is painfully slow at times and very buggy, sometimes I am unsure if what I have done has actually "stuck" in the firmware.I tried loading DD-WRT on these so I could have some better visibility to network traffic ... the router is listed as supported, but it barely works if it all.  So we had to go back to Stock firmware.Pros:Excellent WiFi capacityDual Band (2.4 GHz and 5GHz Radios)Nice Clean LookCons:Web GUI is slowDD-WRT is supported, but does not work properlyUSB drive sharing is slow and requires a unit to be installed
$review_summary.: Pretty Good ... Web GUI is SLOOOOOOW

$REVIEW.: OK, first off, this review comes from our family Amazon account. I basically fix the family computers and use the electronic purchases at home and in business. This optical drive isn't the latest Blu-Ray burner but it offers the best way to label CD's and DVD for archiving and gift giving. This drive has a Serial Advanced Technology Attachment interface. Make sure your desktop's mother board supports SATA optical drives before you buy this. A good percentage of computers I fix will have SATA hard drives and PATA optical drives. This is definately a SATA interface. The Lightscribe technology has been updated and I am using this drive in my Dell studio XPS 8000 with Windows 7. The box did not include a SATA cable or drive screws so acquire those if you are adding this device to an existing enclosure. It seems DVD blank media is as far as HP's Lightscribe offerings will be going for now as Sony has not distributed a Blu-Ray blank media license to third party manufacturers yet so this drive is perfect. This burner is lightning fast and the latest drivers are available at the Lightscribe site today. I recommend this optical drive.
$SUMMARY.: I like the Lightscribe tecnology

Let me tell you. the cable has a nice rigid form and it is not made from cheap wire.. It is a really nice cable with a really elegant design. Plus "Mediabridge Products" seem to be reliable. I love the cable and i WOULD RECOMMENDED! ^_^

$REVIEW.: After using a Foscam for a while, I was ready for an upgrade in terms of image quality

I decided to go for the Dropcam Pro

Here's what I have to say:Image quality, nice
User interface, nice

 So you're reading this and wondering, ok why the 1 star review?NO LOCAL STREAMING WHEN CONNECTED TO YOUR NETWORK

BUST!!!!This camera is going right back in its box and is being returned

What a FAILURE to title this camera as a Wi-Fi monitoring Camera


It should be called ADSL Monitoring Camera because that's the only way you'll be able to view the footage, is for it to go through Dropcam's website (through their servers) enabling you to view it


This is of course so they can push more people to buying their CVR service rather than allowing you to just view live streaming footage on your local LAN
Pathetic

If your internet is ever down, well...say bye bye to viewing whatever you want to view such as a burglar possibly robbing your home, or anything of that nature.There's other Wi-Fi cameras out there that support local streaming like Foscam, Logitech


Go for one of those and you'll be way better off

Without being able to do that on this fancy shmancy Dropcam, it's just a pile of crap


What a waste of $200

Time to return and get my money back.

$REVIEW.: I really like this product for a couple of reasons. One it hold a lot of slides and two, it shows a nice clear picture. The thing I didn't like about this item is the fact that you have to buy a separate transformer or a case of D batteries to use it for long periods of time.It would make more sense to include the transformer with the viewer and charger more for the one product rather than selling these as two separate items. This would make the item much more desirable I think overall.

$review_text.: After going out a few times to take pictures with the provided Nikon neck strap, I knew I wanted something better.I checked around and this OP/TECH Sling Strap was the most recommended in the lower price range so I ordered it.Just got back from my 24 hour of LeMons car race, and when I wasn't driving, I had my camera over my shoulder
Three days in a row for over 8 hours and I could hardly tell i was wearing it


So comfortable! I am also about 5' 10" and pretty fat, and the length is not an issue.It only took a short period of time to get used to shooting with it on and I had no problems hiking around the track, going up and down the grandstands and taking panning shots in awkward positions.The clips are very strong and I was never worried about my camera coming loose
I tied a cheap wrist strap to it as well so if I or my fiance was using the sling with the camera, it was easy to unhook and quickly hand off.As long as you follow the instructions and use only one of the Uni-Loop connectors, it is very easy and quick to slide from the hip to your face.Great product and Highly recommended!Would also work great for megaphones, hand radios, binoculars, etc..

$review_text.: I have both of these adapters, the desktop and portable.  I am very happy with both of them. For the less tech savvy, this is just a Thunderbolt adapter; no drive, no cable.These are being used on a new MacBook Pro and new MacBook Air. I use several drives that were used in external housings for USB2/Firewire and this is much faster. I swapped the drives in cases from Ebay for cheap. Most of my drives are 1TB 7200 RPM drives and a 3 are SSD drives. The SSD drives are impressive over Thunderbolt. I didn't run tests, but real world usage has been amazing. Backing up on Time Machine on the SSD takes about a third of the time it did on USB/Firewire.The desktop adapter is used for a variety of uses. Mostly lots of data, photos from work and some video, many GB of data. I do backup, but not as much as I should. One side effect of Thunderbolt being faster is that I tend to backup more. Also, there's far less time to transfer my work.  What used to take ~7 minutes, now takes about 2-3 minutes. It may not seem like much, but when you do it almost every day, it's a welcome change. Once the SSD drives are larger and not as expensive, I'll switch to all those.I know not everyone uses external drive as I do, so for those simply looking for an external drive, there are cheaper options to be sure. USB 3, if you have it, will suffice for most people. I plan on getting another and daisy chaining the drives for work, which is a nice feature. It's a little pricey, but for work, it's worth it.The bottom line is this is a very good product, however, there are equivalent options in USB3 for some people. If your job has you transferring photos/video/lots of data, have a look at this adapter and an SSD drive.
$SUMMARY.: Not cheap, but very fast and versatile

$REVIEW.: Bought this & another off brand compatible battery for a long vacation I took 2 months ago. So I was basically running around with 3 batteries at all times. I took thousands of pics & a few videos on my vacation & I did, at times, need ALL 3 batteries. I'd have convenient access at the end of each day to a charger. This battery lasted as long as the original OEM one & as long as the supposed extended capacity one that I also bought. Nothing sucks more than running out of batteries in a photo situation either on vacation or before/ during an important event. Do yourself a favor & pick up a few extras to charge & have ready for use on backup. The price for this one was a little more than the aftermarket one but rest assured this is an authentic Sony OEM battery & you can't go wrong with this one. I would DEFINITELY recommend one (or more) of these to a friend or family member.

In a few minutes I had wireless internet on my older desktop.  I have my desktop in a different room from where my wireless router is, and I have no problems connecting.  The distance is about 20 feet from my router, and I have 4 bars out of 5 for signal strength.

The ones that give me the most trouble are from our scuba diving trips. Close ups are usually ok, but taking landscapes and pictures of my wife usually end up looking like I took them with a blue filter on the camera or they are just really washed out. Using White Balance really helps clean them up fast.  As an armature photographer I think this is much easier to use than Photoshop, and has all the power I need.

$REVIEW.: I just bought the Simpletech 256MB compact flash card for my Canon Powershot S30.  I just popped the card in and it worked without the need to format it or do anything else.  The write speed does seem faster than that of my backup card (128 MB Sandisk).  I have not yet tested the read speed with my compact flash reader, but my Sandisk card was fast enough for me at that, so I don't expect much of a difference with the Simpletech card.I bought the card to increase my image storage space, and based on the reviews I have read here, hopefully increase the speed of my camera in use.  I tested the card using the high-speed continuous shooting mode on my camera.  With the image resolution at its highest and the jpeg compression at its lowest, I could get off 5 pictures (indoors, ISO 400, no flash) before the camera buffer had to write to the card.  This was no different than the performance with my Sandisk card, as it is dependant on the camera's internal memory as I understand it.  However, I needed only wait about a second until the camera was ready to shoot again, a noticeable improvement over the Sandisk card.In my limited test, I also shot a 30 second movie at 320x240 resolution.  Again, the Simpletech card performed well, and after the movie completed, I experienced a very short wait until I could shoot again.  The write speed of the card seems up to the claims of the reviews.I recommend this card for its price, capacity, and speed.  I also recommend Amazon.com.  This was my 3rd or 4th order from them and I have been impressed with their service each time.
$SUMMARY.: Simpletech 256 MB card is a winner

You get 2 battery trays, one of which hold 2 LP-E8 batteries, and the other hold 6 AA batteries, if needed.  Though I have 5 batteries, why would I need that? :POpened up the well packaged box, stuck it in my T2i and felt GREAT!  Battery grip feels really well made as good as the camera itself, maybe even better (depends on your own opinion)!Batteries life is very great!  AND there's 4!!  The only thing is, the battery trays seem cheaply made.  Not only that, the locking mechanism seems quite loose when 'locked' which in my case, the tray is not fully in and does NOT power the camera, unless i push the tray in a little, and I mean nanometers, and it'll stay on.  Which is a HUGE problem for me.  I've only used this grip three times, for less than an hour sessions.  But again, you get for what you pay for.If that's not an issue to you, then by all means get it!  GREAT PRICE! Fast SHIPPING!:DP
$SUMMARY.: Great Price!!

$REVIEW.: I ended up returning this item. Although it was a "Genuine Dell" charger & listed as a replacement for the Inspiron laptop we have, it did not charge the battery. It provided power to the laptop, but was not properly recognized for whatever reason, so I returned it. It also seemed like it got very hot. I know it was the adapter & not the laptop that was the problem because the adapter did the same thing with my Vostro (which is also listed as compatible) & the adapter for my Vostro worked fine on the Inspiron. I purchased another adapter from another vendor & the other adapter works fine.

$REVIEW.: Nice mouse.  It came just in time -- I was getting pretty fed up with the scroll wheel in the Mighty Mouse.  I've never seen this product in stock at either of the two Apple stores in my area, so Apple is probably having a tough time keeping up with demand.I seem to get 2 weeks on a pair of batteries... it's in use at least 8 hours/day.

$REVIEW.: These are a scam, a lie, a knock-off, whatever you want to call them.  We purchased six of these because they say they are Uniden batteries and what a great price!  These are the sellers that are going to put Amazon out of business by letting this kind of crap be sold on there web site.After explicitly following instructions, and unfortunately writing the date installed on each one (so no return), we let each of these charge for over sixteen hours before we touched a phone.  My husband and I both work from home and he talks on the phone about six hours a day.  So far, on two different phones, he has gotten about an hour talk time.  This is unacceptable, since after six years of using this phone system, and having eight of these handsets, we know our system. A 'real' battery, newly installed will often give him up to four hours talk time, sometimes five and never less than three.Very, very unhappy with this purchase.

It has a front pocket for any additional accessories you have, in our case an HP v165w 16GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive P-FD16GHP165-EF (Blue) (eForCity - if I'm not mistaken).

$review_text.: While searching for extra charging/data cables for my new HTC Inspire 4G, this came up in the results. Never having owned a Blackberry, I was concerned that the cable may somehow be proprietary, and not work properly with my phone, but after searching though the pictures, and reading some of the reviews, I felt confident to risk the low price in testing out the item myself. It works perfectly for charging and for transferring data. At such a low price, I know I will be ordering more of these in the future.

$review_text.: These speakers are impressive, especially for the price.  When I received the package, the box was a lot smaller than I expected.  These speakers are compact.  I bought these speakers to replace dieing 2.1 speakers that came with an old Dell desktop 5 years ago.  I plugged these babies in and WHAM.  The sound is amazing compared to the old set.  It is much fuller and packs a heavier punch.  The volume control module is very convenient, although it could be heavier, as the wires pull it all over the place.Overall, worth the money.  Hopefully these last me a while.

$review_text.: I got the unit quickly, which was great, but set up was a nightmare. After 2 trips to Radio Shack, I still was not able to find a wire to make the subwoofer work. I ended up plugging just the subwoofer into the DVD player and keep the others plugged into the amp. Now I have to control the subwoofer with a separate remote. Did I mention that all the components are Sony. You'd think everything would get along. Furthermore, why all the speaker wire would connect with clips but the subwoofer would require an RCA plug is a mystery to me. Perhaps that is why the subwoofer wouldn't work. Lastly, no onscreen setup? Grrr...But it was cheap...you get what you pay for.

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these radios about two and a half years ago.  It's been my companion through endless hours of yard work and watching the kids play outside.This radio is built tough by today's standards and has strong reception on both AM and FM bands.I have no idea how long a set of batteries lasts in this thing, but I know its a very long time.  During the Summer I must use this radio an hour or more a day, and battery changes happen many months apart.  Also, the little batteries it uses are cheap!  You can buy huge numbers of them for next to nothing if you shop around a bit or belong to a warehouse kind of store.My main use for this radio is outside in a suburban area.  Only very specialized radios will work well downtown or in a metal framed office building.  These radios tend to cost more.  Don't expect this radio to work well under those conditions.However, if you want to listen to your favorite talk radio show while you're hanging out on your deck or pulling weeds, this is about as good as it gets at this price point.Finally, it's got a speaker that's good enough so you can listen for hours without the kind of listener fatigue that can build up while listening to a cheap radio.

$REVIEW.: The title of this review is intended to be ironic rather than negative, for as the 4 stars I give the Flip Mino HD 2nd generation camcorder are meant to indicate, "I like it." The one thing I don't like, and the reason I give it 4 rather than 5 stars (i.e., the reason "I like it" rather than "love it"), is that when the battery eventually dies, the battery cannot be replaced by the user OR the manufacturer.The website for Flip has an article ("Article ID: 258") wherein two of the many questions addressed are: "3. Does the battery ever wear out?" and "4. How do I replace my battery?"Of course the battery will eventually wear out, and in response to question 3. the article says, "After a period of time that varies depending on use and settings, you may find that your battery will power your device for smaller amounts of time, requiring you to charge more frequently. Rechargeable batteries have a limited number of charge cycles and may eventually need to be replaced." Then, curiously, in the answer to question 4. the reader is told, "You cannot replace your battery on your own. You must request information on battery replacement through Flip Video Support. You may choose to replace your battery while it still has a little life left, or you can wait until the battery does not hold enough energy to power your camcorder at all. Your 90-day warranty includes replacement coverage if your battery is not working as expected. If your battery is out of warranty, contact Flip Video Support for information about battery replacement."For purposes of this review, I phoned Flip Video Support via their toll-free number, selected the technical support option, and was speaking to an actual human being in less than a minute. I asked "Vincent," who had a pleasant British accent, "for information about battery replacement" after the 90-day warranty has expired. And Vincent told me in no uncertain terms that batteries for the Flip Mino HD 2nd generation camcorders are not replaceable, and that when the battery eventually dies, the entire camera will have to be replaced. I went over this with Vincent at some length to make absolutely certain that there is no option for Flip Mino HD 2nd generation camcorder owners to send their dead-battery camcorders to Flip (Cisco) to have the battery replaced, and I told him I was asking for purposes of a review I was writing to post at Amazon's website. Vincent told me that should a battery for some reason fail within the 90-day warranty period, Flip would replace the camera. He told me that users interested in Flip camcorders with replaceable batteries should check out the Flip Ultra models (i.e., the Ultra and Ultra HD). (I knew that Ultra batteries are replaceable from my reading at the Flip website, e.g., the following statement in "Article ID: 249": "Unlike Flip Mino camcorders, Flip Ultra and Ultra HD camcorders run on 1.2 Volt NiMH, AA battery packs or AA batteries which can be replaced once they wear out.")I am focusing on the battery issue because there are so many excellent reviews of the Mino HD II here that go into great detail and depth about the Mino HD II's features and functioning, that there is little reason for me to focus on what a stylish, attractive, convenient, excellent pocket camcorder the Mino HD II is. And it is all that and more. I will mention that at nearly 4" tall (technically 3.94"), it is only 5/8" longer than credit cards are wide (when they are viewed horizontally), and at about 2" wide (technically 1.97"), it is 3/16" shorter than credit cards are from top to bottom (when they are viewed horizontally). So some users may find that the small size and low weight of the Mino HD II more than compensates for the fact that the battery is not replaceable by the user or the manufacturer. (The Mino HD II measures 3.94" x 1.97" x 0.63" and the Mino HD II with 2 hour recording capacity - the Mino under review - weighs 4.1 oz. The Ultra and Ultra HD measure 4.25" x 2.19" x 1.17" and weigh 6 oz.)In his 1984 sci-fi "cyberpunk" novel Neuromancer, set in a dystopian future, William Gibson presciently depicts junk piles of discarded obsolete and/or worn-out electronic devices, gadgets, and parts. Electronic devices that do not have user or manufacturer replaceable batteries, like the Mino HD II, will eventually end up in those piles. And in philosopher and cognitive scientist Andy Clark's non-fiction book Natural-Born Cyborgs, Clark argues that we are already cyborgs who increasingly think and feel through high-tech electronic tools. I would say that the tiny but powerful (as many reviewers attest, it produces great footage as well as sound, recorded in stereo through a built-in "wide-range," i.e., omnidirectional stereo microphone) Mino HD II brings us a bit closer to what Clark calls the "human-machine merger."Would I buy one for my personal use? No, simply because of the battery issue. I would gladly go for the slightly heavier and larger Ultra HD, however, simply because it can not only be powered by the rechargeable battery pack that it comes with, but by 2 ordinary AA alkaline batteries. I would, however, seriously consider buying the Mino HD II as a gift for someone who hopefully isn't as neurotic about battery life as I am, for it is as handsomely boxed as many a fine watch and pen, and would surely bring a huge smile to the face of most any recipient. (I'm posting this review a few weeks before Mother's Day 2010, hint, hint. The Mino HD II would make a great gift for moms, dads, grads, grandparents, and anyone who may be "technologically challenged" - as long as they have access to a computer - for it is incredibly easy to use, truly a no-brainer.)

$review_text.: I have a Panasonic G5 Micro Four Third Camera with the Lumic G X Vario PZ 14-42mm.  A 14mm focal length on a MFT system camera is like 28mm on a 35mm camera.  It's pretty wide, but not always sufficient for indoor photos.This lens decreases the focal length to about 6.3mm (about 12.6mm in 35mm camera terms), but you you can now see the curved black edges of the circular image on either side of the frame.  Once you crop in to the image to eliminate those edges, you effectively have the equivalent of a decrease to 11mm (22mm in 35mm camera terms).  And yes, the image looses some sharpness. And your image now has a horrible barrel distortion.  But... the image is wider, and you can see more.It's not a bad stopgap until you can afford a pricey Pansonic Lumix 7-14m or somewhat less pricey Olympus 9-18mm

The ELM327 will give more detailed info on finding out what is wrong with your vehicle then the basic hand held code reader and pin point the problem a lot better.

$review_text.: Please, Do NOT give POSITIVE reviews until you have had it for 1 Year! I should have done a better job researching this product after reading negative posts again. Product has died in 6th month.  I have the red blinking light issue. 7 times short blinks. Hard drive error. Yeah I tried everything to fix - google/buffalo forum.  Hours wasted!  I need to send back to Buffalo for warranty service. It's amazing to me that the most important hardware I have is my storage devices.  These have to be the most reliable part made!  Luckily I have 2 other backups (not Buffalo).  I have an issue/concern with sending this in for repair or exchange, since I have all my personal stuff on the defective disk and no way to wipe it clean.  I may just remove the hard drive  and send it back to Amazon for some sort of partial credit and let them return to Buffalo.  I wonder if these drives get erased as soon as they go to Buffalo or does the info go to Russian/China./India.  Well on top of it, Buffalo Customer Service hasn't responded to my Tech/RMA inquiries.  2 open tickets no response for 5 days.  Must be busy with their product going defective.  I'm sure they hope it gets to the 1 year expiration period.  Going forward, I think I'm just going to use an old laptop I have and leave it on with a more reliable Non- NAS Storage device.  Basically does the same thing.  Or just leave my computer on full time. (But sometimes I go out of town so family has no access)FYI - Buffalo charges a service fee of $30 for warranty work. Only good thing is that their customer service is located in United States! I respect that and am willing to pay the $30 even know I've never done that for any other warranty item with other companies.Update 03/16/2013: Just got a new replacement and now there is a random Chirping like a cricket noise!  My goodness.  This product is killing me! another return and purchase for this one too.After researching this issue on Buffalo Forum I need to send it back.  Everyone with this issue on forums eventually had a disk failure

$review_text.: Polk delivered what it promises. The Surroundbar was installed below the TV (which is mounted on the wall) at about ear level (when standing) and the subwoofer was put at the corner of the room.  It creates near surround feelings and the quality of the bass is very good.  The remote control is small and convenient and it can control both the volume and the subwoofer output so that one can cut down the bass when the program is more conversational than music.  I did not push the subwoofer to the limit and I will never do so I can not comment on when the sound starts to distort.The installation is straight forward.  It comes with the optical link for the audio return from the TV.  No messy wiring.I am also pleased with its exterial design.Overall, I think it is a bit on the expensive side.  It is the personal taste of how much one wants to pay for quality accoustics.

$REVIEW.: Zune was the laughing stock a couple of years ago when Microsoft released the "brick" 1st-gen Zune. A joke went around about Microsoft's pathetic attempt to enter the "iPod market." So a year passed, and Zune remained a joke in the consumer electronics world and had to endure the jeers and torment of the Apple crowd. When the 2nd Gen Zunes came out, the Zune brand slowly started to see redemption. The Zune 80gb was deemed the first decent competitor to the iPod, but the brand was still in recovery from its hazing.But for the first time, Microsoft has developed a Zune player that can finally use the words "downright sexy" to describe it. The Zune brand image is building up quickly with the release of the Zune HD, XBOX Live integration, and much-needed marketing.With the rapid rise of the iPod Touch and iPhone, it's no surprise Microsoft came up with a touchscreen portable media player of its own. However, this is not a copy of the iPod touch at all. Sure the Zune HD features a touchscreen, accelerometer, app support, a strong web browser and other features that made the iPod Touch so popular.However, the Zune HD has what the iPod Touch lacks, such as...-ZunePass (Download all the music you want for $15/month, keep 10 songs per month DRM-Free)-720p HDMI output-An aesthetically nice software (Zune 4.0 interface is very pretty to look at, not a dull spreadsheet like iTunes)-An aesthetically nice device OS (Artist pictures and info float around while playing a song, it's cool)-OLED screen (brighter, more vibrant than LCD)-Free HD radio-Radio "tagging" (If you like a song you hear on the radio, "tag" it to add it to your cart for download)-A feature called "Smart DJ" that functions identically to the online radio service "Pandora" but has no limitations on skips and allows you to rate/download songs you like. Requires a ZunePass though.-XBOX Live integration-An advanced nVidia Tegra Chip (A couple of graphically-intense 3D games are coming out this fall, like Burnout: Ferrari Edition)-On-demand music (play music online with your Zune HD, don't need to download it to your hard drive)Again, the Zune HD is just simply amazing. With the Nvidia Tegra chip and highly capable processor, the potential for this device is endless. The Zune HD is supposed to be a portable gaming platform to compete head-to-head with the Nintendo DS and PSP brands. I'm excited to see Burnout: Ferrari Edition on it this fall. I'm also looking forward to see more apps as well.Could this device take significant market share from Apple's iPod Touch? With the right marketing to increase public awareness of this product, yes it definitely can. Every large monopolizing entity like Kmart, GM, and even Apple will dominate a market completely for some period of time. However, times change and something better always comes along. Is this Zune HD the better alternative to the iPod? With some more releases in the app store and updates, it clearly will be. The question is will Apple change and copy the Zune's features including the Zune Pass? I don't know, we'll see. The Zune Pass will clearly become the new standard of digital music services and the $1-per-song marketplace model will not be competitive much longer.***UPDATE***I've been getting a lot of comments on my review saying that the Zune's HD radio does not compensate for the lack of online radio services found on the iPod Touch (such as Pandora). I believe I already said in my review that with some more app development the Zune HD will be a strong competitor to the iPod Touch. However, who in the world needs Pandora if you have a Zune Pass? Your Zune will learn your musical tastes and give you recommendations. You can download/stream all the music you want without limits. But if you like Pandora, I suggest playing with the Zune's "Smart DJ". It will create a streaming playlist of songs based on your overall musical tastes or play specifically based on a certain artist.I also forgot to add the Zune HD does not have an external speaker. If that's a super-important feature to you, the iPod Touch may suit you for now. However you can always get headphone couplers or battery-powered mini-speakers to remedy this.***UPDATE***The new apps on the Zune released this fall include some amazing 3D games. They look just as good (if not better) than what you would find on a PSP or Nintendo DS. Among these games are Van's Sk8, Burnout: Ferrari Edition, Audiosurf Tilt, and many others. Twitter has been released as well and Facebook should follow soon. I have no complaints about the Zune after owning it for a few months. I'm convinced the Zune brand provides the best music experience service ever created.***UPDATE*** October 2010It's been a year since I bought the Zune HD. I will never look back at buying another mp3 player. I also discovered in tech blogs that the Zune HD2 is coming. It will have the Windows Phone 7 OS without the phone features (iPod Touch equivalent to the Windows Phones), which means that it will work with all the apps developed by third party programmers. The Windows Phone 7 OS is simply the OS on the Zune HD, but enhanced for more productivity and third party development. It's a strong mobile OS that has an unprecedented amount of flow and integration between all the apps. Microsoft claims there is no need for a copy and paste function because the OS is smart enough to figure out what task you will want to do with the information on the screen.I've been getting a lot of questions about sound quality. The sound quality is excellent and is certainly superior to the iPod's which is reputed to have poor sound processing hardware (It's all in the exterior design and marketing that brings its success). Of course, really compulsive audiophiles might be happier with the Creative X-Fi portable player but 99% of us wouldn't hear the difference.There are now 40 free apps in the marketplace. Although it is no iTunes App Store, they are quality apps and the games are a lot of fun especially when I'm waiting in a lobby. The Zune HD2 is where third-party development will take place though, and hopefully that will bring a lot of apps to the table.***UPDATE*** September 2011***THE FUTURE OF ZUNE***I am getting a lot of questions regarding the future of Zune. The Zune HD has been out for two years (well beyond the typical product lifecycle) and we have had no recent indications of a Zune HD2 still in the works. Microsoft claims the Windows Phone 7 was the Zune hardware release for the year (a great OS by the way, it's pretty much a Zune HD with smartphone capabilities). But what about those of us who don't want the phone? The Zune HD seems to slowly be in the process of phasing out production, and there are no clues of a new device to replace them, so should us Zune users start panicking? Will the Zune Pass, Zune service, and devices be no more?To simply put it, NO. According to several tech blogs with inside connections in the company, Microsoft seems to be transitioning the Zune brand into something else... something bigger picture. With the absorption of Zune developers into the Xbox 360 department, it is a possibility we will see "Zune" become "Xbox" before our eyes. Every Zune service and device will probably be rebranded under the "Xbox" flag, maintaining the same licenses and music/video services associated with Zune.  After all, Microsoft is on the path of "One OS to rule them all." The company wants to offer a uniform experience between the PC, the Windows Phone, and Xbox 360. They all have the same GUI and interfaces. Windows 8 will be 100% integrated with Xbox Live. There's even evidence Xbox 360 games will work on Windows 8 PC's!Anyway, I digress. There are 35 million members on Xbox Live. Why not tap further into that market and offer them a handheld device with the Xbox brand on it? It makes no sense to call the device "Zune" when in fact they are more drawn to the name "Xbox". So ladies and gentlemen, while I am pretty convinced the Zune brand will be no more, all its services and hardware we know and love will now be under the "Xbox" banner.***SHOULD I BUY THE ZUNE HD THEN?***You need a music/video player? You hate iTunes? Then yes, by all means still buy the Zune HD. Nothing else out there matches the value of the Zune hardware and the Zune Pass. If the Zune brand is phased out, you're Zune HD will probably be supported under the Xbox marketplace service after an update, and your licenses and music pass will be maintained. I would not worry. I can't imagine Microsoft pulling the plug on the digital distribution of music and videos. I would simply rebrand the name of the service.

$review_text.: Looks just like the carbon fiber leather interior trim of my car (from the factory)! Simply gorgeous & very easy to install, just tedious that's that. Fitment's very good. Don't freak out if the wrap around edge pieces won't stick at first. Do everything else THEN use the blow dryer for those pieces that won't stick. Only issue I had was when I was taking off (then re-installing) the area around the trackpad, the thin strip tore in half right above the trackpad but you can barely see it. Price isn't too bad especially since I don't have anything else to compare it too. I must've taken it off 5-7 times before getting it right yet it still clings on. I waited 2-days before using it to be on the safe side. I've heard customer service for the lifetime warranty's good so hope it's that way if I ever have issues. Overall, I'd rate it a 4.5 mainly due to the fact it's very tedious to install.BTW, there's no need to use the included spray (not sure why they included this) since it's just for the screen protector.
$SUMMARY.: Gorgeous yet protects at the same time!

$REVIEW.: The longer I use computers, the more I love storage, and the older I get the more I am reminded how advanced portable storage devices are than they were 15 years ago.  But this one jumps an additional mile marker - its thin.  Really thin. And that makes it easily portable.  It also makes it very easy to back up my Mac and store this drive in a fireproof safe without it taking up much room.  When you take it with you in your computer bag, it doesn't take up much space, either.Out the box, it was an easy hook up.  And it is pounds lighter than my 15 year old 20 gig external drive, which has been permanently retired.So to recap, it's small, it has a lot of storage, and its easy to stow or port about.  Love it!

$REVIEW.: Bought it elsewhere because the price was lower than Amazon at the time (though now Amazon's prices have come down too). The professional reviews said this is pretty close to state of the art plasma for a super low price, and I agree. No hitches at all, adjusting picture settings was easy, and the picture is just incredibly gorgeous. Movies look the way they were intended to look -- the color is even more true than the typical movie theater projection system. Motion is handled really well -- no soap opera effect.Here are some decision points to consider:1) If you have a room with good light control, such as a basement den, this TV (plasma with a clear glass screen) is great. If you have an upstairs room with ambient light, this might not be your TV. You probably want LED for more brightness, and a non-glare screen.2) If you want your colors super warm and vivid, then then LED is maybe a better choice. If you want natural, true, accurate color, this TV is about as good as you can find at any price.3) If you want smart TV features or lots of HDMI ports (this model only has two), this is not your model. If you want pretty close to state of the art plasma picture quality for a great price, this is a super choice. We overcame the lack of HDMI ports with an inexpensive HDMI switch.

$review_text.: In this day and age for this unit to be here ( alas any unit that does this! ) is sad. The prpblem that you run into here is that this unit does not up convert sources to the HDMI out that is the common connector for current Televisions. What this means is that if you have anything that uses component output then you will need to run two cables to your television and swtich between the two for different sources. I would really recomend looking elsewhere for a unit in this price range that does the upconversion so that you can hookup older units ( Wii, gamecube, xbox, DVD Players, etc ) and not have to run a 2nd bulky cable to your TV. Just be aware of it. Other then that this is a nce unit for a nice price but if you are concerned about hooking up older peripherals then beware...Let me apologize and append this review. The video out put does not work on sources that are above 4801i. So if you have a component 360 at 1080P it will not come through the HDIM. You will have to hookup the Component. If you have a Wii running at 480P it will not come through the HDMI. So yes, if you have avcr it should work fine. If you have any old sources that are running at 480i or beloew you should be fine. They will come through the HDMI but.. If you have any component sources that are running above 480i then you will have to put them through the component output, not the HDMI..Sorry about the confusion.. !

$REVIEW.: These are actually quite decent. I'm only marking a star off for the chemical smell others have mentioned. It's not a big deal, I'm sure it's just the aftermath of the manufacturing process but still is enough to be a tad unpleasant. Aside from that, I'd definitely purchase these jumper wires again in the future.

$REVIEW.: Installed this in a new beast of a rig with a I7-2600K, GTX 570, 16 GB RAM, IRST setup on a Gigabyte GA-Z68XP-UD3 board. Also have a DVD-RW, blu-ray, 2 WD caviar blacks, and an SSD. It handles everything quite nicely, no problems so far and runs both cool and quiet. For the price, it was a darn good deal. It has a rather obscene number of drive power connectors, probably more than you'd ever need even in the craziest RAID setup.The only concern I have about this PSU are that it only has 2 PCI-E power connectors. If you need more for SLI or whatever, you need to get adapters which aren't included.Additionally, it isn't modular so you're bound to have tons of dangling cables. They include a pile of ties to deal with it, but be advised if you have a compact ATX case it might be a problem.Pros:InexpensiveLots of powerTons of drive connectorsQuiet and runs cool even under loadCons:Only 2 PCI-E connectorsNot modular
$SUMMARY.: Great bang for the buck

$REVIEW.: The product arrived in a timely manner.  I had some problems with it early on with it reliably recording.  I received a replacement unit under warranty promptly from the manufacturer and now it is working very well.  It is a little sensitive to the formatting USB flash drives, but once I got over that issue by formatting the drive as they suggested, it is working very well for me.  I attached an ethernet Wi-Fi dongle to it and it sees my shared drives on my computer in another room. I can record to one of those drives or play any of the files on the computer.  I haven't gotten MPEG-2 video to play well (perhaps the network bandwidth) but it plays all my DivX files quite easily.  I don't find it useful for browsing photos on my network as it wants to generate thumbnails and these display very slowly.  But overall, I'm very pleased with the product.  It can let you view YouTube videos (and search for them) on your TV.  It can do a lot more than I anticipated when I purchased it.  Some familiarity (but not expertise) with Linux is helpful in using the unit.

I'd been putting off SSD for years thinking the technology wasn't there yet, but when Intel released these, and slapped on a 5yr warranty - I thought I should give it a shot. These are so fast it's a joke to go back to spindled drives.128 went in my laptop...240 went in my desktop. Realized I want more space...so the 480 goes in the desktop, 240 goes to my laptop, and 128 goes into a new laptop I just purchased for my better half.Battery life went up significantly with my laptop as well as these draw so little power...Very fast.

$REVIEW.: In this day and age, most hotels and motels offer free Wi-Fi in the room and in the lobby. But there are still some that just have an Ethernet cable sticking out of the wall and do not have Wi-Fi signal in the guest rooms.This pocket router can convert a wired connection to wireless (This adding Wi-Fi/wireless to an existing wired network is called the Access Point Mode), so that I can use all my wireless gadgets in my room. I can add encryption (use WPA or WPA2 for better security) to the Wi-Fi signal, so it is actually better than the open Wi-Fi signal offered by hotels. The Access Point Mode is the configuration in which most people will use.The Wireless Client Mode does the reverse. It converts a wireless signal to a wired connection. Older computers and many game consoles do not have wireless capability. In an area where you only have wireless signal but no Ethernet (wired) network, you can use this pocket router to grab the wireless signal, convert it, then send it through the router's Ethernet port to your device. An example would be using an old Sony PS3 to play online games in a hotel room that has only Wi-Fi but no Ethernet cable.The Router Mode is less useful for an end user, because in most situations, there is already a router in an existing network, and therefore there is no need to add another one.I have only used this DLink in the Access Point Mode and it is fast and safe.

$REVIEW.: Hoped for 5 channels and ended up getting 9.  A great antenna and a reasonable price (when it was $50 on here).  I live out in the country and wanted to get something on TV just for back ground noise especially since my new wife and I just bought the house and don't have money to pay for dish and don't have the ability to get cable.  According to Anntennapoint and tvfool I should have gotten between 5-9 channels and I ended up getting the ladder. The only thing was I had at lot of loss due to attenuation with 3 rooms wired for TV, my initial channel scan it didn't yield a single channel.  So with some patients and gumption to crawl around the attic for a while i disconnected the three way splitter and and just directly hooked the antenna feed up to one line that goes to the living room.  All in all about 125 feet of coax cable between the antenna and the  amp (that comes with this) that is hooked up to the TV.  With the next channel scan I found all 9 channels.  I haven't touched it since and its been 3 months.  I love this thing and would recommend it for anyone.  I'm on here right now to buy 2 more because my parents Dish doesn't give us the football game for T-day in HD..... my antenna does, so they want one for there house instead of their dish for thanksgiving.  Then the second one is for my sisters second house that is also out in the country. I'm sure the reason the price went up is because they know they can get it for this antenna because it works.  I'm not saying you might not get a lemon but the one I received was great.
$SUMMARY.: Works great, just make sure you know the basics for coax length and positioning.

$review_text.: The Mpow Streamnot Y Wireless Bluetooth FM Transmitter Radio Adapter is uniquely designed with its bright lights many functions.  We have a 1990 Chrysler LeBaron Convertible that has the original radio and I really don't want to upgrade it because it will alter it's original appearance. The Mpow FM transmitter easily paired with my iPhone 5S (no code needed).  It's nice that changing the frequency of the adapter can be changed by single digits instead of jumping by double digits.All the controls are easily accessible as you can see in the video.  The built-in USB port is nice to have to charge your phone or other accessories.  When answering calls, the music pauses and you just need to touch the multipurpose button on the top to answer the call.  I can hear the caller clearly through my car speakers.  However, the caller on the other side most of the time has issues hearing me since the mic is located on the adapter and it is plugged in quite a distance away from me.  Anyways I am more interested in using the Mpow FM Transmitter for listening to my iTunes music library instead of calls.Overall this is a great gadget for music, but an okay device for making or receiving calls.Sample for provided for review
$SUMMARY.: Unique design and works well for listening to music

$REVIEW.: When looking for a portable computer to join me on the road, I was most concerned about:* (Exceptional) battery life* (Small) size and weight* (High) exterior durability/build quality* (Solid) keyboard* (Good) wireless hardware/software* (Low) noise and heat* (At least) a 1024-pixel-wide display* (Reasonable) disk spaceAt the time of research/purchase, the EEE line seemed to meet these requirements better than the alternatives I read about, especially battery life. The units are small, the 6-cell batteries really are great in the Atom-based models, the power brick is tiny, a carrying case is included in the package, etc.The tough call for me ended up being whether to get the EEE 901 or the EEE 1000H. At the time, the 1000H was significantly cheaper, came with a larger (and more traditional) storage unit, had a larger keyboard and screen, with nearly the same battery life, and had Windows. (The the Windows version of the EEE 901 really did not sound appealing given the low storage space on it.) I got to try out the Acer Aspire One at a local Best Buy, and felt that the keyboard size was just right. The knowledge that the 901's keyboard was smaller than the Aspire One's worried me, though when I saw pictures online comparing the overall size of the 901 to the 1000 to a normal-sized laptop, it seemed almost pointless to buy something just a tad smaller than a normal laptop, vs something significantly smaller and still usable. Also, the 901's keyboard has been around for a while (used in all EEE models except the 1000 up until that point), and reportedly felt a lot sturdier, even if it were smaller.The Windows question: while I am a die-hard Linux fan, I felt that it might be more practical having Windows on a portable machine that has to go everywhere---on rare occasions, you might run into things where you really wished you had Windows for. Plus with the hard disk in the 1000H, it would be easy enough to partition and dual-boot. If you bought a model loaded with Linux and wanted Windows on it, (I guess) you could try VMWare or something similar or try dual-booting off of the internal SSD's, but you'd still either have to buy it or steal it, neither of which are good options. You really can't beat the value of having it come with the machine.Ultimately, I decided on the Linux version of the EEE 901. It has just the right amount of built-in storage space, is completely silent when using the battery, has a solid-feeling keyboard, easy-to-read screen/resolution, excellent battery life (5 hours when demanding a lot from the wireless non-stop) and overall is just right for my needs. The build quality is great---does not feel or look cheaply made. And it's so lightweight, and it fits everywhere---in the car, on a coffee table; produces very little heat; it's small enough to have two on your lap at once, if you're into that kind of thing. I only wish it were capable of playing MSNBC's and CNN's live video streams. YouTube, Hulu, etc work fine. This is currently my *only* computer, and I've been using it all day for a month. I browse the web, do email and write software (on a remote system). Though the keyboard is small, it doesn't suffer flex in the way that the 1000H's apparently does, and I can touch-type on it at a satisfactory speed---maybe just a bit slower than I would on a full-size keyboard. As a fair warning, I do have smaller-than-average hands. And even with that "advantage", I did buy an external full-size USB keyboard to use when I really have to do some serious typing. But the portability factor of this model is just superb, and the built-in keyboard is really satisfactory 90% of the time. It definitely beats having a larger machine to lug around, even if the built-in keyboard were a tad larger.Finally, a note about wireless: The included wireless software works fine and is easy to use. Reception could be better, but I have nothing to compare it to. So let me put it this way: whenever and wherever I have needed to get online, I've been able to.Way to go Asus, you really got things right with the EEE 901!

$REVIEW.: I have a Samsung 23' 3series television and it only has one HDMI port, which was being used by my PC since I spend more time it


I bought this product because I tired of not seeing my Blu-rays and games to their fullest via my PS3

Man I am so glad I bought this, installation is super easy, just plug this to back of you television and plug your PC/360/PS3/BD-player(has 3 inputs so be wary of that if you have more than 3 hdmi products) into one of the inputs, switch your television to HDMI and done


The box will also auto-switch to the newest source so if you have a PC and PS3 plugged in and have the PC running, then turn on the PS3 the source will change to the PS3, so be careful if you got a game going on PC because it will interrupt your game if a new source is detected

If you have more than one thing running through the box there is a switch button so you can easily switch between them

I do like it's size and length of cable you get, I was able to find a place for it where I can reach it easily to perform switches, Also the fact that it does not require a power source like many similar products is a big plus for me, I hate having a full time plug on accessories


Overall I am very glad I bought this and would recommend it if you are running low on HDMI inputs.

$REVIEW.: I've replaced my four year old Cradlepoint PH300 battery powered USB router with this router since the Cradlepoint has been discontinued and therefore the firmware is not being updated.  This modem is a good replacement if you own a similar discontinued battery powered USB Wireless router and you have a compatible USB modem to plug into it.  I travel and use this wireless router often.  I pair it with a Verizon LG VL600 and have no problems.  I get 4G data throughput when in a Verizon 4G supported area.  I do notice the usable distance (approximately 40 feet line-of-sight) is less than my old Cradlepoint but the battery lasts about 4.5 hours which is an hour more than the Cradlepoint.  Controls and user interface are basic but do the job.  I like the fact I can create a 4G WiFi network while on the road for my laptops, iPhone, and iPad.  The great advantage of having this type modem versus a dedicated battery powered 4G WiFi router from Verizon or others is that my Verizon USB Modem can be direcly plugged into a computer when I don't need to establish a WiFi wireless router setup.  Highly recommended for road warriors who already own a USB modem dongle and want to create a wireless router network for more than one device.

$REVIEW.: I like the portability of the unit, not having to be  tethered by a cord to my device.The noise canceling is nearly non-exsistant IMHO. It is critical to use the proper sized ear buds to get anything close to a good seal in the ear canal, when inserted. Sound quality for the purposes I use it for are adequate, but nothing to rave about.Be cautious when trying different size buds as there is a small piece of mesh (that I assume is to prevent trash from getting inside the body of each earbud that can slip out of position. It has a tacky back and can be repositioned, but it's small and a pain to reset it.

$review_text.: Truth in advertising, I am not a professional photographer not even close.  I like to take pictures but rarely get very artsy with it.  My problem was that I was quickly getting tired of the inadequacies of my previous camera.  It was a good small multipurpose camera but too often I missed getting the picture I wanted because it was either too slow or just didn't have the capability to do what I wanted it to do.  When I shopped for a new camera I looked extensively at larger cameras in the 18 to 24 ounce range.  After reading a review on Amazon about one of those cameras I decided I wanted something smaller.  As the person said, it was a great camera but whenever they went out to take pictures they would look at it, decide it was too large and then grab a smaller camera.  I knew it would be that way with me also.  I wanted a camera with at least a 20X zoom that would be easy to use and would fit in my pocket.  I narrowed it down to this one and two others.  Based on overall reviews on Amazon and reviews I read on photography sites I opted for this one even though it was more expensive than the others.  I have not been disappointed.  I used this at my daughters wedding and then again on a trip we took to New Orleans afterwards.  It has done everything extremely well.  It is very easy to use and easy to navigate to all of the functionality it has and there is a lot.  All I know is that people were impressed with the pictures I was able to get given lighting conditions at the wedding.  Of course this has a 30X zoom, which is greater than I probably needed but the zoom is fantastic and there were very few instances where shaking was a problem.  In fact I can only think of one.  Shaking had been a problem with my previous camera which had a markedly smaller zoom capacity.  There is still a lot for me to learn about the camera but the beauty of it is the camera when left to it's own devices takes exceptionally good pictures so I can take my time playing with the functionality.  Just a couple of words about some of the other functionality of the camera.  I asked a friend of mine who knew nothing about the camera to take a movie of the wedding ceremony.  It came out extremely well even down to being able to hear everything that was said.  I tried the panorama functionality in New Orleans and nothing could have been easier.  I was used to having to stitch things together with my old camera.  With this one you simply sweep the camera across the area.  Nothing could be easier and it worked very well.  I wasn't very interested in WIFI.  It isn't difficult at all to hook this to your computer or pull the memory card and put it in the computer but I tried it out anyway.  It was easy to set up and surprisingly worked very well.  I had set up a WIFI connection for a friend of mine's camera and found it cumbersome and very slow.  This was easy and relatively fast.  BTW my friend sent back their camera.  I'll probably still mostly transfer pictures by cable because it is easy and faster but it's nice to know that you can use the WIFI if you want to.  For me and my purposes this may well be the last camera I purchase.  I can't imagine needing more.  I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to anyone.

$review_text.: Really nice piece of equipment here! The controls are easy to use, touch screen is pretty responsive and Pandora integration with Android isn't too bad. (I think it's the app that screws up rather than the radio) Bluetooth streaming works great and if you hook up the mic it all works together rather well. There's an emergency brake safety for viewing DVD video while driving but I bypassed that lol. The built in amp works awesome now that I've hooked up a sub, relieving some stress on the head unit to reproduce bass. Once that was all tuned and set it's deafening. For me, there's a threaded hole in the back where I was able to modify and reattach my OEM radio support bracket however they don't supply you with such a screw. If you have a garage door opener you probably have said screw so try it. Make sure it's going into metal and not a plastic nut though. Unless it becomes problematic I won't regret this purchase.

$REVIEW.: This is our 8th pair of the FINIS underwater MP3 players (my husband and I each buy a new pair about every year-and-a-half--that's how long they last for rigorous lap-swimming), and we've compared them to other brands


There's really no other worthy brand except FINIS for sound and durability in underwater MP3's that we've found (others konk out in no time), and it's amazing to swim to music (you just can't go back once you've had a taste of this)


I'm not as fond of this new model as I was of past FINIS models because I don't like the complexity of these controls and wearing this &#34;unit&#34; on the back of my neck (really, simpler was better), but the sound is better in these


Overall, I can't complain about a great product line.

It took me 2 hours to set up - let the software set this thing up for you, don't use the "quick" set up directions any farther than hooking the cables up in the right spots. I had to reset this thing like 4 times before I got it to start. I hope that if I have any more problems they'll arise within a month so Amazon can take this back. For now, it's good. I'm just using this as a firewall for now. If I hook it up to another computer I'll let you know whether it works! If you're shopping still, the reviews are definitely better for the Netgear stuff, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed because this was a cheap way for me to get a firewall.

$REVIEW.: I just got this laptop today. Bought it last week at amazon for $475! The instalation is very easy. No unecessary software included so you don't have to worry deleting uneeded junks.The boot up time is as fast as regular laptops. The keyboard is excellent. It took me just 10 minutes to get used to it. You have to press FN and F11 to enable the wireless switch.I used word and excel at the same time, and had 3 windows open at the same time without any problems.It's a nice little machine. I have the 6 cell battery, and it lasted for about 5 and a half hours (I didn't play any movies though). The matte finish won't leave any smudge on the laptop.Overall, this machine is excellent. I am really happy with this laptop. The 10 inch screen is about right, not too small and definitely not big. My co workers were oozing when they saw it. Also, the LCD screen is pretty nice, it's clear and crisp. I don't know how it would look like playing movies tho, but I've tried youtube and the video quality is as clear as my HP slimline desktop pc.The audio is not as good as the high end laptops. Of course, for $479, I don't expect the audio quality remotely comparable to the $1k plus laptops. The audio is just OKAY, not great but, then again, what can you expect from a cheap laptop with above average performance overall?You won't be sorry to have this little puppy. And oh, the color is really nice.. pearl white!

$review_text.: Bought this and put it in an external ESATA/USB2.0 enclosure. The USB2.0 is too slow and I managed to burn a couple coasters. With the ESATA connection I haven't had any yet (i've burned about 15 so far &lt; 2 weeks ownership). I'm using these Philips disks http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00551XMWC and it seems to work best when I put my burning software in 'best speed' mode. It seems to shift around the speed a lot on burning, I assume this is the quality of the disks.Read mode its quite fast and while I was importing a lot of old CD-R's from 1997-2001 it readily beat the internal drives in my MBP, Mac Mini(which wouldn't even read them) and still had an edge over my LG DVD burner (I think its like an 8X from a 3-4 years ago).Overall worked great out of the box, I didn't use any drivers or software that came with it, so YMMV on that. My data management scheme is migrate each oldest generation media to the current and throw the oldest ones on spools. Being able to fit 30+ CDR's or 5-6 DVD's on a single BDR is a nice consolidation and refreshes the data. When BD-DL comes down to reasonable prices I'll get a nice 2x boost in capacity.

$review_text.: Well built bag. I chose this one because I've owned a Targus laptop backpack for 6 years that still looks like new, so I believe this is a reputable brand. In the main compartment, I have my Canon T3i with battery pack grip and 50mm lens attached, a 180mm lens, a 135mm lens, a 24mm lens, the original 18-55mm kit lens, a LCD magnifying viewfinder, 2 lens hoods, and 2 lens filter kits. There is still room for at least one more lens or misc items. In the top compartment I carry my point and shoot camera as a backup, an external flash (Neewer TT560 Speedlite - way cheaper than the name brand ones), 3 extra batteries, and SD cards. There is room for other small items like a cell phone, wallet, MP3 player, etc. In the front pocket I carry my T3i manual. There is also a nice tripod carrying feature in a velcro pouch on the bottom of the bag. It folds out so you can put the legs in it, and then there is a strap on the top to secure it near the top. Oh, and don't forget about the water bottle pocket on the side! It's very important to stay hydrated while you are out walking around and taking pictures.

So I had a full image, and backups of the "important stuff", done so I could easily transfer them.When I received my new computer, I got the Samsung Story out of its box, and hooked it up - nothing.It won't even turn on.  There is no response from it at all.  No power, no nothing.  I have tried other outlets, etc.I do have all the original power cords (it is one of those 2 piece jobs, where you have to be careful not to lose either piece) and the connection cord.  Since it was carefully placed back in the box and packaging, and stored, I certainly haven't mistreated it in any way and nothing accidental can have happened to it.I am now trying to see if I have the receipt.  While it is usually not helpful to try to get a manufacturer to honor a warranty, I am mad enough to at least try.

$review_text.: LN37B550 37-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color...As far as this "Touch of Color" ploy is all about, my set must have received just a mere hint of color from a dry brush as you must actually scan and look for the red color even during daylight hours


 In any event, this touch, or lack of red color, doesn't really do anything for the TV at all.Now, as for the TV, I've had it up and running now for just a few weeks and I like it quite a bit


 Like so many others, I have a rather large (too costly to discard) entertainment wall unit that I purchased around 10 years ago that has become the centerpiece of my living room
It was designed with the traditional "square" hole opening for a TV that will accommodate a standard 32-inch "tube style / square" TV so getting a BIG/JUMBO set became somewhat of an issue

 Fortunately the wall unit has a bit of a ledge right in front of the TV opening so I was able to get a 37" LCD and place it there


 As a precaution I used some very small bungee cords in the back to keep it secure.All in all, the set works very well (great picture) but the sound quality is a bit mild

 The sound is not bad mind you for regular viewing but I will undoubtedly get some kind of sound system to enhance the sound quality for movies and such.Great value!

$review_text.: First computer build.  What am I going to do?  How do i pick the right parts?  To top it off, I need a cool tower that functions well and is built well to showcase the build....here goes nothing!BINGO! It's like I hit the lottery.  The tower looks beautiful, I'm a big fan of Gunmetal finish on just about anything, classy but not flashy.  It has a nice amount of room for install, great cable management, flexibility in the chassis for airflow/hard drives.  USB 3.0 included, fan control included, overall just a great piece.  To top things off, UPS really dinged up the box and didn't do anything to even care that the result of their poor shipping was that my case was scratched up.  I contacted NZXT to find out about replacement panels, and before I could even get all the details about replacing the panels, new ones were on my door step.

$review_text.: This is a beautiful cover.  It looks to be very well made with very good materials, and looks like an old fashioned book.  But, the concern is about the elastic straps that hold the Fire in place.  I'm not sure if they are strong enough to keep it from falling out, especially the way I use it. My Fire goes everywhere with me.  The other problem is there is nothing to keep the cover from flapping open, I would love to see some kind of latch (elastic or something) that would keep it closed.  But, I guess that would take away from the beauty of an old fashioned book.The description also says that it works with a Kindle keyboard.  NOT!  I tried to put my KK in it and there is no way that it will fit.UPDATE:After using this cover for a little while, I am happy to report that the elastic loops that hold the Fire are working very well. Still wish there was a latch of some kind to keep it closed when not in use though.

It is a joy to sit down in front of this TV each evening to watch programs ranging from the evening news to outdoor, nature type programs found on the Discovery channel and others. It may sound trite, but in the case of the scenic outdoor shows, it is literally almost like being there.

$REVIEW.: These are obviously made as a reaction to Monster's Beats by Dr. Dre Studio, which I had the pleasure to try/review earlier. These acheive a similar level of style, comfort, and cool with padded ears/headband and chrome accents on black headphones. The tangle-free cord really seems to be working so far, and includes controls to control an iPod/iPhone and even a mic to use for phone calls.In fact, I'd say these headphones compete with Beats Studio in many respects, even though Beats is about $80 more expensive at the time of this writing.Unfortunately, the one place these headphones fall behind Beats Studio is in the sound quality when using a portable device. The key advantage with the Beats Studio is that they're battery powered, so the amp delivers a little more oomph in the sound. These, on the other hand, never need new batteries, but don't sound as good with my iPhone. Then again, they're definitely better than earbuds, they sound excellent when plugged into something with a better sound card (like my computer), and maybe its an unfair comparison anyway because the SOUL headphones are closer competitors to the Beats Solo than the Beats Studio (the direct SOUL competitor to the Beats Studio is the SOUL SL300WB, which I've yet to try).Nevertheless, it's fair to say what you get with these is an excellent set of headphones for a cheaper price than some others, but if you're looking for the ultimate for portable listening, you may want to check out the SOUL SL300WB or Beats Studio.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent Design/Style

Good thing I can still use most of my PC hardware... well, except for external HDD (can't read windows HDD, and visa versa)You don't have an anti-virus, so no more background scan overhead (until you catch a virus, last the one last year).  Luckily, I didn't have this bad boy back then...The Bad:1- Terrible ergonomics, this is serious, they make the keyboard so small, and most actions require the touchpad, now I have to wear a splint for carpal tunnel syndrome. Seriously.2- Too slippery, can't say that enough.3- Boots in 20 seconds (2-second wakeup from sleep), but you can only use it after 2 mins from loggin in (20 sec from sleep).The Ugly:It's very unreliable:1- Many times the wifi drops connections, and not much help you can find online.  It's happening more frequent...2- Many times, youtube videos get stuck at the beginning, and i have to retry many times, I got 35MBps cable modem, and PCs have no problems... other websites have no problems either. looks like Apple doesn't like Youtube.3- You're vulnerable without an anti-virus... when someone strikes, your helpless.4- You're charging me ~$2700 for aluminum unibody?!?

I have over the ear headphones such as bose and beats, but sometimes I like just having simple in-ear headphones just to let my outer ears breathe. I have had skull candy before and these surprisingly sound as good if not better than those.

$review_text.: These screen protectors are very nice. Unlike some protectors that are thin and flimsy, these are very sturdy and very easy to apply. I always buy multi-packs of screen protectors because I rarely ever manage to get the first one on correctly and usually end up wasting one or two before I finally get one on. Between air bubbles and dust that's never visible until AFTER you get the screen on, it's enough to drive a person insane!With these, the first one went on quickly and easily the very first time I tried. No dust and NO AIR BUBBLES. I always end up with air bubbles that won't come out no matter how much I rub, but with this one, the air bubbles easily moved to the edge and out so I have a nice, clear screen. You can't even tell there's a protector on it and I love it. It looks great and works great, like it's not even there.I'm not sure what they mean by anti-fingerprint. The screen definitely doesn't resist fingerprints. Either that or I have the oiliest fingertips in the world, but at least they wipe right off with a dry cloth, leaving the screen crisp and clean again.Best of all, this screen was a perfect fit for the Xoom. I've bought screen protectors for other devises before that are a close fit, but always have that little crack of space at one end where the screen cover just doesn't quite reach the edge and that's always where the dust ends up. This screen fits perfectly from edge to edge. Between the screen protector and my rooCASE, my Xoom is guaranteed to stay good as new for a long, long time.

$review_text.: I had previously been opposed to over the ear headphones as they became too hot. These do not have that issue. Even for large ears such as mine, they edges of the ears will barely touch the rubber. The sound is perfect, and the rumble feature brings a whole new depth to music or gaming. You have to like loud bass, as the rumble feature is not adjustable directly. You would need separate software to adjust the bass levels. As for the microphone, it will take some configuring. I have microphone boost on, microphone level at 24. If you are recording for YouTube such as me, the game recording level has to be altered depending on the game. But it does sound quite good once you get it right. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: Bought this to go with a Onkyo Surround System with Receiver.  I have not figured out how to get video out of the iPod Touch yet, even getting audio seems to be sketchy at times?  The remote does not seem to work either, so it is a very expensive charging dock with connections for playing music through the receiver.  Admittedly I have not spent any time trying to figure this out, nor am I willing to.  If you plug it up to the correct input on the receiver it should just work, it does not.  The $25 Belkin dock does everything this one does for me at $100 less, I have bought two of them for other systems.This may be less the fault of Onkyo's design and more due to the fact that Apple changes the iPod interface every 15 minutes.  They are masterful at designed obsolescence so older accessories don't charge the new iPods and some other functionality is probably lost as well.

$review_text.: I am using a battery grip on my Canon 40D and it is always loaded with 2 batteries in it

These batteries last almost as long as OEM Canon batteries

Almost..

I would estimate they last about 75% as long but at a small fraction of the Canon battery price they value is hard to beat.


$SUMMARY.: As good as new, almost.

$REVIEW.: Before a recent off-road group outing, a CB was on my short list. After reading plenty of reviews I kept finding myself turning back to this. Finally pulled the trigger and ordered one - even picking up a ~$10 savings on a repackaged one from Amazon's Warehouse Deals.I've had such success with the AA battery base attached that I haven't even been deeply tempted to permanently install the unit with a fixed antenna. Here's my take on it after a half dozen trips.Pros - Comes with everything needed to be functional, short of batteries and a fixed mount antenna.- Adequate range on alkaline battery power and stubby antenna.- More than adequate battery life. I did 2 day-long trips before I was tempted - not forced - to change batteries.- Startling clarity. A fellow 4 wheeler asked me what unit I was using, that he wanted to buy one for a backup / handheldCons - might be a minor point - or a technical nightmare - but it'd be mad handy if the unit could be used with 12v power andthe whip antenna..In short - there's not much more to be added to the fine reviews and the strong performance of this unit. For value, clarity, power, versatility and installation flexibility, I can't see this unit getting beat.Update:Relative to the "Con" noted above... I emailed Midland support to ask about the 12v / whip antenna issue, and to ask about a replacement volume knob. They very quickly and graciously responded that it is indeed possible to use the unit on 12v power with the included antenna. Here's their clarification:"When you slide the mobile adapter on the bottom of the radio it disconnects the rubber duck antenna on the top of the radio. To avoid that from happening you canplace a small piece of tape on the bottom of the radio over the small squared contact right next to the 2 screws on the bottom of the radio before you slide on the mobile adapter."A replacement knob was sent as well.I tried out the unit with the 8 AA rechargeable base. Worked great for the trip, staying on a total of 30 hours in scan mode while I ran the batteries out. (Eneloop rechargeables)

$REVIEW.: This camera came new in the box damaged. It looked OK and took nice photos, but the USB port would not work. The seller would not accept a return because the box got discarded with the other Christmas boxes and Nikon refused to repair it under warranty. Despite numerous requests Nikon said the defect was my fault. Can you believe? I have well over $10,000 of Nikon DSLR equipment and they wanted to charge me over $100 to fix a new $279 camera. I love my Nikon stuff and never had to deal with the customer service before, but if you need warranty repair, forget it! Nikon is not a company that is customer focused. The rep on the phone actually told me that, can you believe? Yea, he said the repair person would be upset with him if he asked for a reevaluation of the warranty status. WOW!I'm switching all of my gear to Cannon!

$REVIEW.: I am actually using this battery type in my own product design (not a camera)

In my product development I have discovered this particular battery uses a resistor instead of a thermistor in the temperature sensing circuit
i.e
there is no actual temperature being sensed by the charger, which can cause damage at extreme temperatures (at or below freezing)The simple act of bringing your camera in from the car on a winters day and immediately popping the battery on the charger may kill it.

$review_text.: Pros: Build quality, quality to price ratio, packagingCons: Microphonics when worn downPackagingThe DUNU Trident came packaged in a familiar looking box, those who have either the Crius, Ares, or Hephaes will notice similarities. A rather large white box presents the users with a picture of a female dancing and the Tridents. On top the DUNU logo appears, on the bottom the model name. There is also some writing in Chinese, though I do not read Chinese so I'm not sure what it says. On one side of the box there's a pictures of highlights of the Trident such as the leather carrying case and the high quality cables. On the other side an enlarged profile picture of the Trident is shown. The back showcases product information and specifications in Chinese and in English.That information is all on a cardboard sleeve that is slid up or down to reveal a black cardboard box that has the DUNU logo and opens like a book held closed by unseen magnets giving it a high quality feel to it that owners of other DUNU products will be familiar with. When opened the user is greeted by the Trident sitting securely in a velour coated plastic casing with the leather carrying pouch sitting below it. The housing is lifted up to reveal the included tips. DUNU decided to include a wealth of tips such as: Single flange wide nozzle (S/M/L), single flange thin nozzle (S/M/L) and a pair of bi-flange tips which are small sized.The Trident come well packaged for the price though as someone who cares about the environment I wish DUNU had made the packaging a bit smaller. Aside from that everything looks fantastic! Elegant, high quality packaging with a good selection of tips and a nice looking carrying pouch. This is definitely above average for the price point.Design and Build QualityWith the Tridents DUNU decided to go with unique cone shaped design that fits well in my ear. The Tridents are definitely well made with a seemingly unibody aluminum housing that has nice weight to it inspiring confidence in the build quality. Each housing is color coded either red (right) or blue (left) on the outside of the housing around the sleek DUNU logo. The housing is two toned, a grey body with a gold outside. This gives the Trident a sleek look to my eyes, good choice!The housing leads to a decent length stress relief that feels solid. The cable is nothing special, but it feels high quality, I have no concerns about the durability of the cable here. The cable comes to a y-split that has DUNU plastic coated, a sleek integrated cable draw looks very nice. The cable terminates into a 45 degree gold plated 3.5mm plug that feels well built.Once in your ears they feel decently comfortable. They're not winning any prizes here, but they feel secure in my ears with a semi-deep insertion. Isolation is decent, slightly better than average with about 60%-70% of noise blocked out with no music playing and all of it blocked out with music playing at a reasonable volume. Microphonics are somewhat apparent with the Trident worn down, but not a problem when worn over ear. For those who have Comply 400 series tips or Sony Hybrids these will fit without a hitch.The Tridents are built to the excellent build quality standards DUNU has set with their IEMs. Everything on the Trident and attached to the Trident feels incredibly solid. The comfort is average here, while the isolation is a small step up from average. The whole package would make me think these are closer to $100, which impresses me that the Trident so well built, while maintaining a good sound.Sound QualityAs usual I've allowed 50 hours of burn-in before making judgements.Astonishing balance for the sound price is the first thing that comes to mind with the Trident. I recently reviewed the Brainwavz Beta and praised their sound quality to price ratio and the Trident are very close to being as much as a value. The Trident have a rather balanced sound that leans slightly warm with decent clarity. The lows are borderline great on these. The lows extend well, have some decent mid bass slam and have decent detail in the bass department. Unfortunately the bass is a tad slow and slightly bloated, this causes fast paced electronic music to feel slightly behind, as if the Trident are playing catch up. Despite the slightly bloated bass the mids still have good presence and punch to them. The mids are slightly forward and rather sooth sounding making the Trident more than adequate for alternative rock or other mid-centric music. The highs leave something to be desired here though. The highs aren't bad, but they're laid back and not really the focus. There's no sparkle in the highs unfortunately. The highs are rather clear though when they are by themselves with no sign of sibilance!The soundstage is average here, I really miss the fantastic imaging the Betas gave me when listening to these. Instrument separation is decent though, I never felt congested when listening to anything. Each instrument has room to breath, a small amount, but enough to give them room to pick apart. As good as the Trident sound though for the price they sound somewhat flat to me. They just aren't as musical as the Brainwavz Beta where I feel a part of the music. The Trident's just don't pull me into the music as much as the Betas. With that said the Trident are still a lot of fun to listen to music on.Let's test some tunes!Feed Me - Strange BehaviourThis is a dubstep song so it has a substantial amount of sub-bass with a lot of mid-bass slam. There's also a lot of sound effects and samples in this song. The intro sounds very good, the vocals are smooth, the synth is nice and fuzzy, but the samples sound a bit flat. The intro ends and the sub-bass kicks in. The Tridents extend well, and the mid-bass has nice impact. The sub-bass is heard, but I don't feel it. The balance of the song still sounds good though, while the bass rumbles I can still hear the vocals and other instruments clearly. The Tridents sound decent for bass heavy music to my ears.Led Zeppelin - Good Times Bad TimesA classic song with great energy to it. Again with the Trident I feel they are a bit flat in sound taking away a lot of the energy from this song. The guitars have nice crunch to them and the vocals are smooth and have nice presence. The drums sound clear and on level with the bass, though a bit fuzzy. Everything sounds good, but the song just doesn't come to life.Sigur Ros - StaralfurI chose this due to the fantastic balance of the various instruments, it's imaging and due to it's classical like similarities. The violin and other string instruments sound nice, going in and out of focus, but the depth isn't enough to give the song the 3d imaging that makes this song immersive. The vocals sound clear and the piano is warm and fuzzy. Every once in a while one of the violins will hit a high note and it gets a bit grainy causing me to slightly wince. Sigur Ros sounds good on these, but it's missing the depth to make me immersed in the song.Kanye West - POWERThis is one of my favorite recent hip-hop songs and despite it's iffy mastering it's something I'm familiar with. The bass is expectantly boomy and the song has good energy to it. the samples during the chorus and the "21st century schizoid man" sample sounds very grainy enough to make me wince. The bass is definitely the star here, but Kanye's vocals sound good through these, though at times I feel as if the vocals are trying to push through the bass. I think hip-hop fans will really enjoy these all things considered though.Animal Collective - My GirlsThis is a wonky electronic song with a lot of energy in it. The synths sound wonderful right away and the vocals sound on point. The synths aren't phasing in and out as much as I would like though, there's not enough depth to the soundstage unfortunately. The song maintains a nice balance to it though through the various vocals and the bass coming in. The bass is a bit prominent though pushing the synths a bit back in the mix. The song sounds fun though as it should, yes I said it sounds fun if you listen to Animal Collective you'll understand.ConclusionThe DUNU Trident are a fantastically built budget IEM with good sound to them. The soundstage and imaging aren't it's strong suits and at times it causes the songs to lose energy. The sound though is great for the price, a nice balanced sound that leans a bit to warm side. These IEMs are a great recommendation for all types of music and are definitely a great budget IEM that will withstand some abuse. For the $40 asking price these are very hard to beat as a complete package, DUNU shows again that it's more than capable of making a well priced, built and sounding IEM.
$SUMMARY.: Decent budget IEMs

After plugging it in it looked for the software. It didn't find it on its own, but when I asked it to look for it on the disc it found and installed it right away. The item itself is super small, unlike other bulkier USB wi fi adapters. This made it even more convenient, because it meant I could plug it into the desktop without moving the desktop too far away from the wall. Within 10 minutes I was surfing the internet and and it was up and running. Highly recommended for any gadget that requires a shared internet connection.

It's getting tiring. Nobodys going to play smashbros with the gamepad Nintendo, you all know it. Nintendo should focus on fun and creative games (and they do!) but stop feeding us hardware gimmicks.

$REVIEW.: Overall, this is a very nice design, both in the tradeoffs and the layout, especially the connectors (some quibbles below). My admiration as an engineer for how well they packed so much into a small package gives it one star of "extra credit"  that offset the deduction of one star for the collection of minor problems.This review does not summarize the readily available specs, but adds details that I expect are useful to an "enthusiast", which in turn I hope will help you decide whether this is the system for you.NOT JUST HTPC: Although the Blu-ray drive causes this system to be considered a HTPC (Home Theater PC), it and similar "nettop" models from Zotac and competing manufacturers (ASUS, Acer, Lenovo,...) could be suitable in a range of other uses.  If I was still Corporate, I would experiment using it in conference rooms and sending out with sales reps for presentations: uses where it will be connected to a projector/big screen and controlled with a wireless keyboard and pointing device. Laptops are currently used for this, but the convenience of having an integrated display and keyboard has been diminished by much of that usage shifting to smart phones, and that convenience is often offset by "bad behavior", such as preemption (reallocation) of the laptop and the loading of unrelated software that introduces conflicts and other problems. For offsite use, the portability of this system compares favorably to corresponding laptops. Similarly, the form factor is likely to be well liked by the SysAdmin/assistant who needs to load/refresh a presentation and give it to the presenter for practice and verification.Another situation where a nettop is a possible replacement is where a laptop is used as a space saver rather than because it is actually mobile--hanging a nettop on the back of a monitor could be even more efficient.----Basic Details----Be aware that various summaries/reviews on the Web can be misleading about the available connectors because the ZBOX has some combined connectors, most notably an eSATA/USB2.0. Sometimes the summaries fail to highlight the either-or; sometimes they double count, for example omitting the "combo" designation on one or both of the table entries.Performance: Roughly what I expected from the specs.  The standard benchmarks can be found in various reviews on the Web. For a quick first assessment, the Windows Experience Index is: Processor=3.5, Memory=4.5, Graphics=4.8, Gaming=5.6, Disk=5.9.  Notice that the processor has the lowest rating--this may be a surprise to those unfamiliar with the Atom's intentional tradeoffs. But also recognize that the Graphics/Gaming scores show the ability of the ION graphics chip to offload computations that might otherwise bog down the Atom CPU, that is, for a range of tasks, the _system_ performs much better than the CPU stats might lead you to expect.  But for tasks that make demands on the CPU, this system is likely to be sluggish (The web has a range of comparisons between various models of the Atom and mainline Intel processors. The rough guideline for roughly comparable Atom and mainline Intel CPUs is that the Atom needs to have a 50% higher clock rate).Ports: As I thought through the various combinations of devices I would be connecting, I was impressed with the layout and the combo ports (also on other nettops).  That said, the box would benefit if there was room for one additional USB 2.0 port on the back because a keyboard connected to a USB 3.0 port is not recognized during booting. The USB 2.0 port on the back is combined with the eSATA port, which may make it undesirable for the keyboard. Although the need to have the keyboard input during booting is infrequent, that also means that if you have it connected to the USB 3.0 port, it may take you some time to remember why the keyboard isn't being seen, with the accompanying frustration. Remember that once the system is up and running, the keyboard can be hot-swapped to another port.Main memory: The system is advertised as having DDR2-800 memory (PC2-6400), but mine reports DDR2-667 (PC2-5300  although some versions of the specs do specify 800/667). My system's memory has a SPD for 800, but the default data rate is 667, with timings of 6.0-6-6-18-24 and 5.0-5-5-15-20 respectively. The fault is partially Samsung's: Its model number uses the higher data rate ("2Rx8 PC2-6400S-666-12-E4" with chip ids of "M470T5663EH3-CF7"), but the 5.0-5-5 timing are _often_ regarded as corresponding to the normal/default data rate (but with plenty of exceptions). When I switched the data rate to DDR2-800 (in the BIOS, from "Auto"), my Windows Experience Index for memory increased from 4.5 to 4.9, and the reported timings had a CL (CAS Latency) set at 5.0 (instead of the 6.0 in the SPD, but corresponding to the "566" in the chip's id).  I am currently using this setting. If you have a laptop that is to be handed down and it has faster memory, you might consider swapping. Similarly if it has a now-unneeded SO-DIMM, you might move it to the empty slot.Note: Stats via a combination of CPU-Z and the BIOS.Note: Even when memory is _capable_ of being used at the higher data rate, it sometimes may be better to run it at the lower one: Way back when I did (modest) overclocking, some architectures benefited from higher data rates (Intel?) while others gave better results from tightening the timings (AMD?) and certain classes of applications benefited from different choices. Normally one finds this info in the discussions of overclocking, but since the Atom allows only trivial overclocking...  Before worrying _too_ much about this, consider whether the overall system would benefit. My _guess_ is that any gains aren't worth the effort. Aside: A web search for other Atom D525 systems returned many that were using DDR2-667.Note: Competing models also come with only 2GB of main memory. My ZBOX came with 2GB in one slot and one slot free. At least one competing model has 2x1GB -- a memory upgrade requires replacement rather than addition.Note: DDR3: There is a sibling model that offers DDR3 memory, but from what I found on the Web, DDR2 may well be preferable for this class of processors. And when I looked at current competing systems, most were using DDR2. Recognize there are complicated tradeoffs: That for DDR3 to be better than DDR2, it needs to have a data rate enough higher to offset its higher latencies, plus the processor needs to be able to take advantage of that higher data rate. DDR3 has the advantage of using less power = producing less heat, but I don't know how relevant that is to this type of system.Disk: My system came with a Samsung "HM251HI". Other reviews complain about its relatively small capacity (250GB), but that is not an problem for me--my personal preference is to have smaller disks on systems such as this and have most of the disk storage on my primary home computer which also serves as my file server.  While one might guess that the small capacity is to reduce noise or heat, the larger capacity disks in this product line have the same or better stats. Consequently, there doesn't seem to be a barrier to upgrading to a larger capacity disk, if desired. The disk is readily accessible and seems trivial to replace. Reports on the Web rate this disk highly, but there are warnings that this series is "overly vulnerable to power surges and overheating" (SalvageData), so make sure to take what should be normal precautions. This disk is one "sub-generation" back (suffix "J" is current), but I couldn't find what the differences were (probably insignificant).  It has Samsung's SilentSeek and NoiseGuard features, and Advanced Format Technology (larger sectors for efficiency and better error correction).Note: Replacement disks are limited to 9.5mm thick.Blu-ray drive: It is slot-loaded and worked as expected as a reader, but is painfully slow writing discs. It seems to take almost an hour to write a DVD+R from a 4.3GB ISO image. The drive's interface is USB 2.0. It smoothly handled 8-cm mini-discs (contained software for additional USB peripherals). If you should need to replace this drive, it appears to require first removing the motherboard, and this appears to be something that the manufacturer wanted to discourage you from doing. Not only are there no instructions for either, the first set of screws that you would need to remove are under the glued-on feet for the case.Video: The "Next Generation ION" (aka ION-2) is superior to what you probably expect from onboard graphics. Start with the dedicated 512MB of GDDR3 memory (vs 128MB of _optional_ sideport memory on various desksides). The choice of connectors allows you to have a broad range of monitor combinations via adapters: The HDMI and DVI connectors are convertible to the other (without audio), and a DVI-to-VGA adapter is provided with the system.  As a test, I connected two widescreen monitors and simultaneously played a Blu-ray movie on one and streamed a TV show (from Hulu at 480p) to the other and didn't see any problems with either image.Note: when using two (widescreen) monitors under Windows 7 with Aero, I get the message "The color scheme has been changed to Windows Basic - The current color scheme has exceeded its allowed memory..." even with only a single window open (nothing on the second monitor).  I suspect that this is just Aero being a pig.  I couldn't find if it was possible to share main memory with the graphics processor (although I did encounter others on the Web asking this question). If you are running two monitors and need Aero, I expect there is a setting somewhere that will raise the relevant resource limits.Note: Earlier reviews here reported problems with video quality. Their tests may have better stressed the system or they may have better eyes than me. Or the intervening patches (drivers, Flash, Windows) may have dealt with those problems.Audio: The ZBOX spec claims 7.1 audio, but this needs to be qualified. The ION GPU supports 8 channels over HDMI, but you need software that uses this capability, such as the included PowerDVD Blu-ray playback.  Be aware that the Windows 7 audio drivers support only two channels: the NVIDIA and Realtek drivers for HDMI and the S/PDIF connector, respectively. Other reviewers reported being unable to play audio files with more than 2 channels with the normal Windows software.Motherboard: DMI info is "Zotac".  The specs omit that there are two mini-PCI-Express slots, one free and one occupied by the WiFi card. With a hard drive installed, the second slot is difficult, but not entirely impossible, to access (my WiFi card was in that second slot, leaving the more accessible one open).----Split personality product----The advertised all-in-one nature of this hardware targets it for people who don't want the hassle/fun of assembling a system, but the terse instructions assume that you have experience with system building or leading-edge systems.  For working with the hardware--for example adding/removing cards--the system is simple, straight-forward and immediately obvious if you have worked with other systems, or are mechanically inclined. And if you don't have that experience, the instructions are clear and provide adequate detail.The deficiencies come when installing an OS and potential customizations of the devices.  Because the system doesn't include an OS, Zotac has slighted those instructions.  The primary gotcha I spotted is for loading Windows: The instructions do not tell you to plug your keyboard and mouse into a USB 2.0 port because the USB 3.0 ports are inactive until you load the drivers from the provided CD (system builders are aware that new/unusual hardware doesn't have drivers in the Windows distribution).----OS----I loaded Windows 7 Home Premium because it seemed simpler to get operational quickly and because that configuration would be easier to compare to my other computers.  I am considering switching to XBMC at some point.Be aware when reading early reviews (here and elsewhere): XBMC "Dharma" was in Beta until Dec 2010, so some of the reported problems with XBMC (HDMI audio, Blu-ray support) may have been resolved.Windows Driver Updates: I was surprised that several of the updated drivers were not handled by Windows Update but had to be downloaded from the Zotac website (Realtek HD Audio, USB 3.0, WiFi). The descriptions of the updates were little more than the device and OS, when I would like at least a quick summary of changes that are often provided.----Included Software----As to be expected, the included Blu-ray software is dated but functional. PowerDVD versions have a history of being released annually in the spring. Version 8, of Spring 2008, is the one included.----Cooling/Noise----Cooling: The CPU, GPU and nearby components are cooled by a ducted fan that draws from the bottom and exhausts to the right side. The remainder of the system is passively cooled, with a large vent on the bottom and vents on the two sides. During active use, the fan exhaust peaked at 45 degrees F/25C over ambient (112F/44C in a room at 67F/19C with the CPU reporting 125F/52C degrees). The air at the vent on the other side ranged from 1-5 degrees F above ambient, which may be side-effect of heat from the other side.Ventilation: The instructions have the usual statement from consumer electronics products about providing adequate clearances. The small size of the box may mislead people into providing too little (for example, treating it like a Blu-ray player). You should provide both clearance and air flow especially on the right so that the hot air isn't being sucked back in."Noise" is subjective, but let me try to quantify: I estimate the noise from the fan to be about two-thirds that of the Blu-ray drive when it is operating (although masked when the drive is running). Consequently, the fan noise is noticeable in a _quiet_ room at close distances, and being a small fan, it has the predictable higher frequency noise. The fan has the expected smart (temperature) control, but I haven't _heard_ any decrease when I am not using the system (short of going to sleep).  Typical fan speed seems to be around 2500 rpm.If this is an issue, some of the fan noise exits via the intake vent and you may be able to reduce it by putting a less reflective surface underneath the device, for example a thin rubber mat, felt, or other cloth. Important: Don't use something thick that the feet will sink into--reducing the clearance not only impedes airflow to both sides of the system, but will likely make the fan work harder and thus be noisier.----WiFi----WiFi hardware: There may be differences in the hardware you receive. Some of the reviews written at the time of the product announcement stated that the ZBOX had _onboard_ WiFi. Mine came with a mini-PCI-Express WiFi card, the AzureWave AW-NE766 (Ralink 2700-series chipset). I found Web posting on this card back to 2007 (ASUS Eee), but it is no longer listed on the manufacturer's web site, and I didn't see it listed for sale except as used. This card supports both the 2.4 and 5.0Ghz bands.Note: IEEE 802.11h support--which provides DFS and TPC--is disabled by default, but is required to be enabled in many countries when using various channels in the 5.0Ghz band (configurable by Windows Device Manager, under the device's "Advanced" tab).These cards may be multi-sourced: The Installation CD has three subdirectories under WiFi--Atheros, Ralink, Realtek--suggesting that you could get different WiFi capabilities, plus the envelope of my Installation CD had a sticker telling me which of the drivers from the Setup menu that I should install.For performance measures, I didn't have a different card so I can't separate the capabilities of the card from the built-in antennas.WiFi, my experience: The performance was adequate at short distances, but very poor at medium distances. WiFi performance is always very much YMMV because it can be significantly affected by minor details of the environment in which it operates, both how easily it can pass through obstructions and how well it bypasses obstructions by reflecting off other surfaces. Setup: For comparison, I used a cheap USB mini-dongle (body 1.5 inches long) built on the Realtek RTL8191SU (WiFi-N, 300Mbps) and several older WiFi-G adapters. I used WirelessNetView to monitor signal strength (reception) which is a good first approximation of performance and has the advantage of being easy to monitor.1. In the same or "next room" to the router/access point (AP), performance was the same or slightly better than the dongles. Its position in the "next room" was 29 feet from the AP with an always-open doorway that was about 5 feet off line-of-sight, thereby providing an easy path for reflections.2. Because of the absence of external antennas, the ZBOX needs to be able to operate in various orientations relative to the AP. I tried various orientations--horizontal, vertical and various angles of both relative to the AP--and saw negligible difference in signal strength at _my_ location (same range of variation that occurred with the box just sitting there). In contrast, the various dongles registered roughly 25% changes in signal strength going through similar orientations.3. I then moved the ZBOX to the room just beyond the "next room", about 40 feet from the AP, but without an easy path for reflected signal around that interior wall. The ZBOX was intermittently able to establish a connection, but unable to maintain it for long enough to do even modest data transfers (such as POP'ing recent emails). In contrast, the dongles provided usable connections, providing signal strength readings 30-50% higher. I put a 15dB directional antenna on my AP and pointed it towards the ZBOX and got a tolerable connection. At the dongle's worst orientation--horizontal with top pointed at the AP--it still had slightly better signal strength than the ZBOX.4. As a _proxy_ for testing the relative range of a WiFi adapter, I use the SSID broadcasts from my neighbors' APs (all WiFi-G). The dongles pick up 7-10 stations reliably and quickly. My adapter with a good antenna sees 10-15 quickly and picks up another 5-20 intermittently. The ZBOX never got more than 3, including never detecting a next door neighbor.  This implies that its capabilities fall off very quickly with distance.5. With an adequate signal strength, I didn't see any dropped connections, pauses or other glitches. First was the download of the Windows updates (lightly monitored). I also did a 10GB of file transfers that I monitored (10GB because my typical _weekly_ downloading from the Internet is 10-20GB). However, because of limitations of my setup, my speed tests were very limited. For cross-the-room WiFi-G/N (2.4Ghz, 20Mhz wide channel, AES, WPA-PSK/WPA2), I got slightly better than 30 Mbps _data_ transfers which is effectively the maximum one could expect in my environment.My first reaction to the WiFi performance problem was "Why didn't the system have provision for external antennas?". Then I remembered my experience helping a range of people with WiFi problems: I would suggest upgrading the antennas (and had loaners) but they were remarkably resistant to that, preferring to buy a new device at considerably greater expense and with no guarantee that it would provide any improvement. Consequently, the designers' apparent assumption about how customers would improve WiFi performance--using a USB adapter rather than antennas--appears to be well-founded.----Mounting----The package includes a mounting plate that can be used to mount it on a wall (or other vertical surface) or on the back of a monitor. The plate has both 100x100mm and 75x75mm VESA-D patterns. Here are additional measurements because some monitor designs don't anticipate the VESA mount being used in conjunction with the stand: The plate extends 3/8 inch beyond the 100mm holes and the bottom of the case extends 1/4 inch beyond the plate, but the box can swing out on the mounting hooks so that the case is almost 1.5 inches away from the back of the monitor.Note: On various monitors the VESA mount is used to attach the stand to the panel, in which case it is unavailable for mounting the ZBOX. This configuration seems very common on smaller monitors (22-inches and less).----Power Supply----Although I don't like power adapters ("bricks"), this is the right choice for this system: It keeps its heat away from the system box. The adapter itself appears to be one commonly used with laptops (19V, 4.74A, 90W) which should simplify replacement should it be misplaced or fail.----BIOS----WARNING: The window for getting into the BIOS is _very_ small: I was unable to catch it pressing the DEL key 1-2 times per second, and got it only pressing the key very rapidly (and not always then). I rarely see the Logo/BIOS screen--even on Restart'ing, the monitor stays black until the "Starting Windows" screen appears (well into the boot sequence). If you want to lengthen this window, turn off the BIOS's default setting of abbreviated POST (Power On Start-up Tests).----Case----The bottom half of the case is 1/32-inch steel and it provides a strong, rigid frame for the case. Good rubber feet combined with the inertia from the overall weight of the system keep the case in place when there are minor forces on the cables.----Status Light----The large circular blue light on the top of the case is very bright. If you find it annoying, you can turn it off in the BIOS: The small Power On/Off Indicator next to it provides the same info (in sleep/standby mode, this indicator flashes slowly). If you have the case mounted on the back of a monitor, the large light is bright enough that the status info is visible without you having to peak behind.-- Douglas B. Moran

The cradle (which is detachable) held my iPhone (it works with many similar phones) but the suction on the back felt like it wouldn't last.  In fact, I wished the cradle had some kind of stiff holder for more security.  Then it would be held by two sources.FRIEQ states that the stickiness will return after washing off dust or dirt, but I don't quite feel that it held my phone securely enough.  There is also a more permanent mount included that you attached to your dashboard that acts as a base for this car mount.  The cradle does rotate 360 degrees and angles so you can view your phone properly.  For the low price, it's not a bad deal, but your phone is precious.

$REVIEW.: Have been using this to put some more space between my flash and lens


Using on a Nikon DSLR with a wide angle lens to take pictures of people at outdoor events


Works great for being able to shoot freehand from an elevated position
Good grip, nice balance

Only complaint might be, as some others mentioned, a smell like gasoline or kerosene or something petroleum based when you first unpack it


An afternoon out in the FL sun cooked that off easily enough though.



$SUMMARY.: Great balance for DSLR with offboard flash

$REVIEW.: Overall this is a good bag for the price
It is decent looking and seems to be well made

I like the cell phone pouch on the strap

A few reviews complain about the size
Personally, I think this bag is meant to be more of a laptop case that can carry a few books rather than a full size backpack that also can carry a laptop


To me it is perfect for the typical college student

I never took my books to class, so all I really needed was something big enough to hold a notebook and some miscellaneous items

This has plenty of room for a laptop, a notebook, and a book or two plus small miscellaneous items
The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the laptop sleeve does not fully cover my 15.4" screen laptop

An inch or so of the end of the laptop is exposed

I think it will be fine, but there is enough room in the bag that the sleeve could have been made just a little bigger.

$REVIEW.: UPDATE: October 3, 2009:Unfortunately the stereo fm option did not work at all on my KA12AIR radio, so I sent it back to Kaito for a new unit. (The unit's fm as heard either through the earphones or through the speaker still sounds great in my opinion even if it isn't in stereo however). The local Kaito office in Montclair, California just informed me today that this fm stereo feature doesn't work on any of their current units that are now in stock, so if you really want this device my humble advice is to wait a while until the overseas factory corrects this rather serious deficiency (as advertized both on the original box and in the Kaito advertizements on Amazon, etc. as being available).ORIGINAL REVIEW: September 18, 2009:I ordered this very fine item at noon on Tuesday of this week. It was shipped by Kaito from CA on Wednesday by USPS Priority Mail and arrived in New Mexico early today (Friday). Now that is service for a ~$6 shipping and handling fee!In my opinion, they are definitely going to sell a bunch of these fine units at this price.The KA12AIR radio is a super small pocket sized unit and almost identical in size to the Sangean DT-400W that is so popular right now (with full am/fm and weatherband capabilities). In fact it is also a remake inside the Aluminum front shell of the Kaito KA105 radio which apparently didn't sell very well, probably because of its slow band  scanning and its very limited shortwave reception capabilities (~5.95-15.6 MHz).Pros:1) Very miniature in size and also quite light, the KA12AIR is a PLL (Phase locked loop) digitally synthesized and most likely (at this price) a single conversion IF (Intermediate frequency) radio, consistent with the KA105 design and with a lone (single) bandwidth (but well chosen) with good fm reception and great air-band reception (118-138 MHz) with no bleeding from the fm band that I have discovered. This bleeding is in fact a common complaint regarding the Grundig G6 am/fm/air-band radio that also sells for twice the price of the KA12AIR radio! It tunes using fixed 0.05 MHz steps on fm and with fixed 0.025 MHz steps for the Aircraft band frequencies.2) Excellent and very fast band scanning capabilities. Also, excellent and fast ATS memory storage system with 100 memories. It also has an easy memory retrieval system for previously stored stations. It is also very easy to either delete individual stations or all of them.3) It has an on-board clock in either a 12 hr (with a leading P designation to distinguish the evening civilian hour format) or a 24 hr format (with seconds showing for both formats while the system is off, but not available while the radio is turned on) as well as a slide lock system for preventing accidental setting changes including the fine, on-board green LED light which emanates from only the left hand side of the LCD screen.4) The LCD is a good size considering the smallness of this radio and has good contrast at varying angles and numerous icons including error conditions and also showing battery life continuously both while the radio is either on or off. The LCD screen also indicates when the lock switch is activated, the current band selection, when an fm station is being received in stereo, sleep delay timer conditions, etc.5) It can be tuned six different ways to receive your desired stations (including a fine automatic tuning and storage- ATS and even a nice memory retrieval system) with an Enter and Exit digital key system with the latter used for correcting entry errors. It also has a very good and easily maneuverable, side and nearly flush-mounted fully rotatable antenna, also just like on the KA11 and on the KA105.6) It has a working local/DX switch control, an external antenna jack as well as an input plug for a 6V power supply (the power supply is not provided, but it is available separately from Kaito). The volume control knob is an analog pot (potentiometer) with a good deal of volume adjustment/turning available. The system also comes with a set of earbuds and a wrist strap (already attached). The latter item can also be used, as on the KA105, to support the radio on a table with a small insert attached to the strap.7) It also has a nice and very small reset key to unlock the microprocessor if it ever hangs up on the front of the unit or you can also simply remove the batteries briefly if you don't have a paper-clip or other sharp object handy. All the keys by the way have very good response and have a nice feel, but they also cannot be clicked too fast in order to properly register.8) It is powered by 2 AA batteries that should last for quite a while (based on the KA105 behavior and performance). The rear battery door is firmly attached to the radio so that it won't get lost and overall the radio is made of very high quality materials and shows the very high quality workmanship that has gone into its production (also made in China as is expected these days).9) It also comes with a high quality and very readable English language manual.Cons:1) The fm stereo reception cannot be turned on and off as it could directly on the KA105. This could be a problem for especially weak signals, but at least it does have a single step DX/local switch (for controlled signal attenuation for interfering signals) that works as noted above.2) The lone bandwidth doesn't emphasize the low frequency end of the spectrum so fm music audio listening through the otherwise good quality on-board speaker is limited.3) It doesn't even come with a slip-cover protective case, presumably to keep their overall costs to a minimum.4) It is too bad that a compatible am reception system could not also be available on this otherwise very fine radio.

$REVIEW.: I used this card in my Casio Exilm High Speed camera and it works great. I can't provide details on the speed, but I have used slower cards, so I can at least give a comparison to past experiences. It seems to work fine when viewing movies on the camera, no lag or choppiness.  Also when copying them off to my computer's hard drive it takes a reasonable time for a large file.I can't say much about the space since I never come close to filling it up. I use it to film golf swings and usually copy them off and delete the old files. I have filmed hours of golf though and at high speed which creates larger files, and still had room to spare.Hope that helps.

$REVIEW.: I bought the Zune HD AV dock with a new Zune HD, hoping to capture videos from the web to display on my TV.  The dock itself comes with the fitting for the HD installed, and with alternate fittings for the two other Zune models.  It also has an HDMI cable and a composite video cable for connecting to a TV.  There is a connection for power, and for a digital fiber audio cable (but no digital cable).  The dock is equipped with an unlabeled remote.  There are no instructions on how to operate it at all.  I have not been able to get either HDMI or composite video or audio onto my TV.  There is some obscure feature you need to employ to switch the TV connection ON, which I cannot fathom.  I have been able to play audio podcasts through my stereo.  Unfortunately, there are no HD radio stations in Upstate NY, so I can't report on the HD audio experience, although FM works fine through the Zune.  So I am disappointed with the dock so far, but hope that I will be able to figure out the video problem.  Bottom line: unless you have a clued-in teenager in your house, you should think twice about buying this dock.

$review_text.: Of the Alpha-mount lenses I've tried using with this adapter on an NEX-6, I've had the following results:- Minolta 50mm f/1.7, Minolta 28mm f/2.8, Minolta 100-300mm zoom:  Seems to work fine.- Minolta 35-70mm zoom:  Cannot achieve focus in most situations


 There's a sweet-spot at about 8ft from the subject where I can just about get sharp focus, but closer or father than that doesn't work


 This lens also has a macro setting and I can get focus with that in some situations, but further away from the subject then I would have expected

 The results were so bad, and so different from my other lenses, that I dug my old Konica-Minolta 7D SLR out of storage to try the lens on it to see if it was broken


 The lens still works fine on that camera, so the fault appears to be with the adapter.Asking around, the best guess is that the 35-70mm zoom is a more complex lens with more focus groups and as a result must be exactly the right distance from the sensor in order to work
 My other lenses are simpler and likely more forgiving, so can still achieve focus even when the distance to the sensor is off by a small amount
 The conclusion is that this adapter is likely slightly off (say, half a millimeter too thick or too thin)
 As it was relatively inexpensive and works with most of my legacy lenses I'm keeping it rather than trying to get a better one.

$REVIEW.: Ordered from Amazon


Free shipping, came in 4 days, great
Transmitter is great


Allows song skip, shuffle, folder change
The unit responds well to how you copy the files


I chose to use a USB Flash Drive
Only minor complaint would be the flash drive sticks out and can cause some clearance problems on lighter sockets buried in a compartment or an ash tray


I use mine in my trailer so works well there
Tons of music available just by dragging and dropping files
Eliminates having to buy new steroes for vehicles that are not MP3 capable, and also eliminates carrying around a bunch of CD's

The cheaper units will not shuffle or skip, so extra dollars for this unit are well worth it
Sound transmission is great

Can't tell any difference from a normal radio signal

Haven't used on the road much so can't speak to outside interference, only noticed a slight hiss in between songs
Almost unoticeable
Remote only works up to about 8 feet away, not really an issue in the car


Liked it enough to buy a second one.

$review_text.: At first glance, it's an amazing product.  It's a great size, it's thin, bright, with nice buttons and a nice pen.I just got mine and am using it to work with as a normal tablet (to control the cursor on my main screen), and also to work directly on and draw/paint.I use a 21" Cintiq at work and also have a 6x8 Intuos 3 tablet that I used before getting this new 12" Cintiq.The 12" Cintiq has a lot of flaws - so much so that I think I may have to return it, which is really disappointing.First.  Though it's a "12-inch" screen, I'd say it's more like a 10".  Why?  Because when you move the cursor to the edges of the screen - a little over an inch away from each border, the cursor starts to shake tremendously.  This simply doesn't fly when you're trying to keep a steady hand and get a good line while drawing or painting.  It's also very annoying when you're just trying to click on something in the menu bar at the top of the screen.  The cursor looks like it's spazzing out and it's really hard to live with.I think part of the reason for this may be because of the limited 2-point calibration, as someone else who reviewed on here talked about.  The calibration is just nowhere near refined enough.Like I said, I also have a 21" Cintiq and I don't have this problem with that.  They just didn't do a good job with the 12".Second.  The excessive cables.  They really need to figure out how to slim this down and simply it - and I think they could.  Before you buy look at the manual online and see all that you have to do to get this thing working.  If you're thinking about taking it with you on the go with your laptop, forget it.  There's so much to have to deal with.  I don't see why they can't just make a simple cable  like Apple's Cinema displays - it plugs into the DVI port, a usb port for the pen to work, and then a power brick, which then plugs into the wall.  That'd be so much simpler.  The cintiq itself is very thin - so it lends itself to portability, but when you have to consider all the extra cables and connections you have to make, it doesn't work out so well.Third.  The quality of the screen.  It is cheap.  When I first plugged it in I wasn't disappointed - I saw my desktop background on this small 12" screen and it looked nice and bright.  But then I started working with it.  When you're actually drawing in Photoshop the line doesn't look nearly as crisp as on my Apple Cinema display.  Text also suffers.  Just reading through web pages it's quite noticeable.  I think another review said that they just used a cheap laptop screen, and after working with it for a couple days, I think that person was right.There are nice things about it.  The design is nice and like I said before, it's nice and thin so it sits nicely on my desk (a problem I have with the bigger ones is that they are SO bulky).It's easy to pick up and put in your lap.  And the stand is nice too.I really wish that it didn't have the problems that it does because I'd love it to work well.My main problem has to be the cursor jumping around and shaking - it's really awful and I don't think I can stand it.  It's worst at the edges of the screen, but you can't even click and drag to scroll down a web page without the cursor shaking.  It's not only annoying, it's almost unusable.  I'm used to using my Intous 3 and my goodness - what a difference.  That one is SO much better at tracking your pin movement.Worth $1000?  Not at all.  Hopefully they'll come out with a better updated one sometime soon - then it may be worth the price.

$REVIEW.: I normally don't wear headphones because they are so heavy. Within a few minutes, I normally have a headache, just from wearing them. So I was VERY pleasantly surprised that these are so light (battery included) that I barely feel I have them on my head. Plus, they don't press against my ears and are very soft.When I first tried them, the dishwasher was running in the background, and these minimized the sound. But when my daughter came out to talk to me, I could easily hear her (once I turned the sound down).I enjoy the controls on these, once you get used to where they are on the earphone, it is easy to feel them by touch and operate them. I am using these with my computer and iPad rather than my iPhone, so I am not answering the phone with them and can't speak to how well they work in that capacity as far as clarity. I trust another reviewer will be able to speak to that.While having a multi controller might seem difficult, actually it is quite easy to use - pushing it down to turn it on (or pair it),  pushing it down again to turn it off, one click to answer or hang up a call, two clicks to refuse one. The forward/back buttons on the headphones (for music) are separate, so you won't accidentally skip your song forward when trying to turn the volume up or down.A majority of my music is &#34;easy listening,&#34; &#34;country,&#34; and &#34;praise,&#34; music, all of which are in midrange and played very well. I have some hearing loss in one ear so I turned these around to be certain that the sound was great in both speakers, and it was. What I appreciated was that there wasn't a heavy bass sound even when I was listening to music with drum beats in the background - it was mellow, and yet the sound was clear and sharp.They are, in fact, everything they claim to be! Comfortable, light, and easy to listen to.A quick heads up (something I wasn't aware of), not all apps on my iPad are compatible with Bluetooth headphones - a problem with the app, not the phones.I received a complimentary sample of the headphones from Arctic so that I could check them out for a review. Fortunately they allowed me to keep them when I was done, since these are the only over the head ones I will wear. :-) Nice, very nice!

$REVIEW.: This is certainly not the end all of tablet cases

 It is not the best case you will ever use, nor is it the absolute best at protection


 That said:The price is reasonable, and it performs as good as some cases that cost twice as much


 The Origin case comes in several colors, such as basic black, a bright blue, a florescent green, and purple.The 7&#34; Fire HDX fits in snugly


 I have this case in three colors (blue, black, and green)
 The buttons are accessible, and line up fairly well, but on the blue case, did not line up100% perfectly when I first put the Kindle in the case


 The button cutouts lined up well, except the volume up/down was ever so slightly off
 After removing the Kindle and reinserting it a few times, the cutouts lined up better


 This is leather so it may have needed to just stretch a bit on this one case, as the cutouts were perfect the first time out on the green case and the black case.The case seems to me well made and is leather, except for the inside which is a microfiber, and a tab on the back which secures the cover when it is used as a stand

 The tab feels like a plastic of some sort


 It stands up well, although it takes a couple of uses for the bottom to flatten out fully.The case is thin, but should offer some protection
 It does NOT have a magnet for wake/sleep options.Overall the product works as advertised
 I would recommend it if you want a case which is reasonably priced, offers some protection, yet is not at all bulky(thus retaining the slimness of your Kindle HDX).I will update this review if performance/durability becomes an issue.

$REVIEW.: I've tried other universal remotes in the past, but always discarded them and went back to the individual remotes.  I bought the Harmony One based on a number of favorable reviews.  I've used it a little over a month, and although it has its faults, it fits the bill better than any others I've tried.  Aside from the space they take up, I have never minded too much having five or six remotes to use.  But when my wife wanted to watch something it was another matter.  In the past she followed a detailed list of instructions, like a pilot's pre-flight check list.  The Harmony One addresses that issue perfectly.  Now it's a simple matter for her to look at DVDs or TV.  So for that issue it is a home run.The unit has some nice features, including lighted buttons, touch screen and an accelerometer to detect motion.  Programming is done via a computer connected to the internet.  All you need is a list of the model numbers of the equipment you want to control.  Setup was a snap, and it can be changed easily by running the setup again.  When complete the settings are downloaded into the control.  It has a rechargeable battery, with a stand that recharges the battery when the unit is on the stand.  I found the battery life good enough for several days use without charging, perhaps a week if not used too much.  (Picking it up turns on the lights under the buttons and the touch screen, which shortens use time on a charge.)  The design of the unit is well thought out.  The functions of the physical buttons are intuitive.  The same button may perform different functions depending on the equipment being controlled.  For example, the play, pause and stop buttons work for both a DVD player and a DVR.  For a given piece of equipment, the functions are assigned to physical buttons in a generally logically consistent manner.  Those functions that are not assigned to a physical button are put on the touch screen.  The screen can display three pieces of equipment or major functions at a time.  If there are more than three, there are page buttons to scroll the display.  As part of the setup process, some functions are assigned to the touch screen.  I'm sure Logitech attempts to assign the most frequently used leftover (not on a physical button) functions, but not always.  I found the touch screen is not as reliable as the real buttons because there is no tactile feedback, and because of their location are difficult to actuate with one hand.  If you want to use a function that is not on a physical button or on the first page of the touch screen list you can access additional functions by pressing the Devices button and selecting the device.  Once that is selected the screen will show all otherwise unassigned functions in a 6 to a page layout.  The labels on the virtual buttons are quite generic, and it is often difficult to determine what each does.  For my A/V receiver there are 19 pages of these functions.  For my DVD player there are 16 pages.  Alas, they seem to have used a generic set of functions which don't necessarily exist on the equipment you're attempting to control.  My DVD player, for example, has a nifty high speed playback mode with sound.  It's great for listening to lectures or playing through boring parts of a movie without missing anything.  There are no buttons for this function, physical or virtual (or I haven't yet found it due to the cryptic labels on the virtual buttons).  There are also functions on the touch screen that don't exist on the equipment it is controlling.  An example: For the DVD player there are Disk 1, Disk2, etc. to 5.  This is probably intended for a 5 disk DVD/CD player.  So Logitech apparently uses a generic list of functions for a particular class of equipment rather than customizing them for the equipment.  The other slight annoyance is that they may put a frequently used function on the touch screen rather than assigning it to a physical button.So while the Harmony One isn't perfect, it is the best I've seen so far.  It does what I expect from a universal remote - it allows casual users to operate even a complex equipment setup with ease.  I was so pleased with it at first I took the batteries out of all the individual remotes and bagged them for storage.  But after a week or so I got them back and keep them handy for times when a function that is not on the usiversal remote is needed.

$REVIEW.: I used this system along with 50' of CAT 5e cable and I honestly couldn't ask for a better system. It comes with a blue LED that lets you know that it properly received the remote control signal. I found it to be very bright (a little too bright) so I hid it and found that I don't need it anyway. I was concerned about interference from the plasma tv and there was none. I have the sensor mounted behind the plasma and it is plenty sensitive. I just point the remote in the general vicinity of the tv and it works perfectly! So glad I didn't drop hundreds of dollars on a "plasma proof" system.On a side note, I also used 50' $39 HDMI cables and those worked fine as well. Don't waste your money on the very expensive ones because there is no difference.

$review_text.: I purchased this remote after my Harmony 890 basically crumbled into dust in my hands over time. This remote is 1/4 of the price, so I didn't expect the world. But I'm actually reasonably surprised. Everything works as it should. All the features I need and use are there. Setup isn't as easy as with a Harmony, but it's not terrible either. A CD is included, but it's essentially the owners manual in video form. No setup software or anything like Harmony. But, using the users manual and a little time and you'll have it down pat. After an attempt or two, I can now program a huge macro without even opening the manual. Pretty easy once you understand how it works.***I haven't gotten the RF20 to work with the Logitech Harmony PS3 IR-Bluetooth adapter. If anyone has gotten this combo to work, please comment on this review and let me know how :-) ***The first thing I liked was the build quality. Those that have owned a Harmony know what I'm talking about. These buttons feel solid, don't rock back and forth in their positions, etc. It's just all around well built. Like it should be. (And actually better than the $300+ Harmony I had even when it was new) I also like that there's some space between the buttons. That's also something else the Harmony didn't have.This remote has only 5 multi-function buttons surrounding the screen. My old Harmony had 8. That is a little drawback. You do use those buttons quite a bit, so I'd like to see more there. But you can page over and get 5 more selections. Just an extra button press each time. My biggest complaint is really just the lack of fine customization. The Harmony allowed me to attach any function for any device to any button. The RF20 allows you to rename each function, but you can't actually move a function, say, from the 3rd page to the 1st page of features. The functions for my cable box, for example, has two functions on the 1st page that are just labeled ">>I" and "&lt;&lt;I" which don't seem to do anything, but yet the RECORD button is stuck back on page 3. I'd like to move the RECORD feature to page one for quick access but that doesn't seem to be possible. Meh. Guess I'll just put up with it. No huge deal.Again, I'm slightly spoiled by a full-featured Harmony, but the build quality of the RF20 is much better and, most importantly, it's 1/4 of the price. For the price, it blows just about everything else away.

$REVIEW.: I fell in love with SLRs in my early 20's...the process of taking the photos, through developing the film, and generating my own prints. I would never claim to be a pro, but I understand the value and usability of cameras that do more than point-and-shoot.In the last few years, my household has acquired aCanon EOS Rebel T2i 18 MP CMOS APS-C Sensor DIGIC 4 Image Processor Full-HD Movie Mode Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-inch LCD and and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lensas well asNikon D3100 14.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens. I've been very pleased with the each of these cameras' strengths, leaning somewhat toward the Nikon.When offered this Sony I was especially interested in the touted smaller body size. This, for a busy mom, is a HUGE selling point. I wasn't disappointed. At least 30-40% smaller than the Nikon and so much easier to tote around.While there are manual functions a plenty, I find the iAuto function to be adequate for most of my needs. This camera is brilliant at taking photos. Seriously have been hearing friends go on over the quality of photos. I feel like a Sony sales rep when I talk to them :)After about a month of sticking with iAuto, I moved on to experimenting with other options. I waited so long because I wanted to have a good feel for the camera, plus, when you have a 2yo running around you can't take the time to set up the special settings quickly enough.Branching out into the settings you can use in the manual and semi-manual modes (like miniature, BW and red, High contrast BW) opened a whole new world of love for this camera. AMAZING PHOTOS! Even more comments from friends. I feel like a pro, but the biggest decision I have to make is "Which special setting to use today?" That and whether to go with aperture or shutter priority depending on lighting and location.Even if you don't have mad technical skills for taking photos, this camera will help you out by just testing the waters with settings.It possesses even more advanced features than the ones I regularly use, but I haven't gotten into those because, as I said, I have a 2yo on the loose.Also, when I've printed photos from this camera at home, they are super sharp, even up to 11x13. I happen to useHP Photosmart B8550 Inkjet Photo Printer, which is an excellent at-home printer if you're addicted to displaying all your newest favorite photos.If you only own one camera during your child's young life, this should be it. Compact enough to carry without being a hassle. Takes amazing photos, super easy to use and offers hi-quality recordings as well.The ONLY downside to this camera is the placement of the 'record' button. It's basically on the natural thumbrest for the the camera so I've turned it on countless times.I know it's pricey, but so worth it if taking more creative photos is what you're seeking, especially as a parent.

$REVIEW.: Bought the Roku player, it arrived yesterday

 The setup was so painless that the experience left me feeling unsatisfied, you see, I am used to wrestling with technology, I don't feel satisfied unless I work up a good sweat and have a shouting match with at least one technical support person


 Denied these dubious thrills, I am all but enamored with the ease of the Roku.I unpacked it, plugged it in to the wall and connected the Roku to my television,  the Roku immediately found and displayed my wireless network on my television screen

 I put in my security code for my wireless router and was up and running


 5 minutes
 A virtual quicky, and like I said, I feel a lack of necessary foreplay, but since consummation was the priority, I'm proud of my performance.Setting up my Netflix account was easy; using my laptop I can now pick out films from the Netflix library, move the film of desire to the top of my queue, select instant view and that film appears automatically as an option for viewing on my television
 It is that simple, and at no extra charge


 Like the youngin's say - how cool is that?  I was curious to see how well it would stream a high definition movie on a wireless G network


 The picture was fantastic, no glitched frames, no sudden stopping to buffer content


 It exceeded my expectations.I set up my Pandora Radio account in the same way


 Everything works,  you can even create new stations, rate music, etc, all from the comfort of your couch, and the sound quality is excellent.So far, I'm damn fond of the little Roku box

 It is so modest, and so cute

 Under $100.00 for the HD version.I'd like to remain aloof to the world of techno-gadgets, and such is my mindset, but Roku has softened my resolve, slightly.

$review_text.: My wife and I purchased an iPad Mini for my mother for Christmas but didn't get her any accessories because we thought she would like to choose her own, particularly a case/cover
When we saw her this past week, we noticed she still did not purchase a case for her iPad Mini and when asked why, she said all the ones she saw were too expensive and/or looked cheap (she went to her local Walmart)

My dad later then pulled me aside and asked if I could get her one, so I immediately jumped to Amazon.My wife owns the newest iPad, my father owns the iPad 2, and my work loans out an iPad 2 as well
The common theme among all these is that of all the cases on each of them, they are all $55+ and in my opinion, all of them suck (with the exception of my father-in-law's, which we got him for ChristmasNew Trent Arcadia NT38B/IMP38B Airbender ClamShell Keyboard Case for the iPad (4th Gen) with Retina display, NEW iPad (3rd Gen), iPad 2, Bluetooth keyboard /w matte finish compatible with the iPad (4th Gen) with Retina display, NEW iPad (3rd Gen), iPad ...).So that's when I found this one


At first I was skeptical

I mean for $17.95 (as of 1/19/2013), you can't imagine that the case would be any good


Even with the smaller size of the iPad Mini, you would imagine anything cheaper than $30 is crap
But not this one
The case itself fits the iPad Mini snugly and what surprised me is the autowake/sleep function ACTUALLY WORKS! Of all the cases I've mentioned in my previous paragraph, none of them were autowake/sleep compatible.The other feature I really like is the elastic hand strap

This works exceptionally well because it allows you to hold the iPad without gripping it

Plus since the iPad Mini is light, you don't get tired holding it up (this works exceptionally well if you have to hold it, like if you wanted to read an eBook)
The stylus is a feature my mom really likes (she mainly plays games on her iPad) and for the constant poking at the screen, she's able to enjoy it and not get the screen greasy

The stand is actually sturdy and holds the iPad up well (but given the size of the iPad Mini, me and my mother prefer to use the hand grip to hold it close).The only feature I would probably deem as unnecessary is the ID/card holder pocket

I mean I guess someone would use it, but I personally wouldn't put any of my IDs or credit cards there
That's what my wallet is for..
but alas, this is my mother's case and not mine.If I were to purchase an iPad Mini, I would definitely get this case first

It's affordable, really well made, and has great features.

$REVIEW.: I recently found a program called motioninjoy (a third party driver) that would allow me to connect my PS3 controller to my PC using a usb cable or Bluetooth which my computer doesn't have. At first was ok with using a usb cable whenever I wanted to use it, but after a while it just got annoying to pull out a usb cable, connect it to the controller, and connect it to my computer. It took too long and was a hassle to set it up and connect it when all I wanted to do is just simply turn it on and play. As I was looking for a Bluetooth adapter I found out that motioninjoy is very picky about what Bluetooth adapter you use. I went to their website to see which ones work the best and found a page that shows a list of compatible adapters and found this one on the list. I figured that since it was so cheap (I only paid $2 with free shipping) that I would try it. When I got it today I was shocked to see how small this adapter really was. I plugged it into my computer running Windows 7 Home Premium (64-Bit) and it found and installed the drivers within a few seconds and motioninjoy connected to my controller once I paired it and works perfectly. I didn't experience any lag time or any signal dropouts at all and it works just as good as using a usb cable on my controller. I am so happy now because I no longer need a usb cable for my controller to work and I never have to unplug the adapter because it's so small. I am satisfied with my purchase and will update this review if anything goes wrong with it.

$review_text.: I got this cord on recommendation from a professional photographer friend. It works just as expected. There is one small flaw, but it was not worth removing a star. You might need to use a zip tie and sticky mount to help secure the top shoe from moving 1/10 of a inch when the flash is on it left to right. But if you are using it on a stationary stand this should be a non-issue. Besides that it works and is a solid piece of equipment. If there was a shorter cord I would buy it.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this camera directly from Foscam since I was looking for the same form factor of my old FI8910W ( http://amzn.to/1aAKdQB ), while getting an increase in resolution. I've had the FI8910W since March of last year and never had any issues with it, and it looks like I will be going back to it.I am on my second one of these cameras, as Foscam replaced my first one under warranty (the customer service was very good, we will see about this second return). The main issue with this camera appears to be the hardware, in specific, the lens. This camera suffers from both poor focus, and also poor contrast. I will be posting two snapshots here in &#34;customer images&#34; to show you what I mean. Both photos were taken in a completely black room, with the IR light disabled.As you will see, the image contrast/brightness is very unbalanced, in my photography experience, this is more than likely an issue with the image sensor. This imbalance is a particular issue at night since the part of the image which is saturated, washing the image out, making things indistinguishable. In addition to the contrast and brightness, the focus is also very blurry and it is not until you zoom in, that the focus comes into balance. Unlike my older Foscam, this camera does not give you the ability to twist the front ring to adjust the focus yourself.One other minor gripe on this camera was that my replacement came with glue or resin caked around the camera lens ring. This is only a superficial issue, but it makes me question the quality of manufacturing of this product.I will keep this review up to date since I have just contacted Foscam customer service again regarding these issues. If you are looking for a camera like this, I would hold off on this new model until the quirks are worked out of it. If you have to get something immediately, I would try one of Foscam's older models such as the one I posted earlier in my review. You may suffer some in terms of resolution, but in my experience, the overall image quality will be acceptable.Thanks for reading.

$review_text.: Purchased unit, downloaded NAZA v2.12 and the current firmware for the helicopter.  It came with v 3.0, and I updated to 3.14.  Then followed the instructions on DJI's website to calibrate the compass and for flying instructions.Problem is the motor will not start.  The drone recognizes the remote whenever I shut it off or turn it on.  Researching "dji phantom 3.14 firmware motor" on the internet lists others with similar problems.Now I have an expensive paperweight that I can't fly.I'll update the review with any progress as I research solutions.--------Update.  Found a backdoor to restoring the original firmware and now it works.  However if I try to update it again, the motors fail.  Not happy.Backdoor procedure requires Naza software available from DJI's support web siteClick on "no updates" next to firmware, type "door", enter "test" for username and "125" for password---------Update: I had the same issue with more recent firmware 3.16, however re downloading the default parameters from DJI's website, and performing the compass and IMU calibration, put me back in business.  The quadcopter rocks!Anyone purchasing the unit should go to DJI Phantom's website and run through the tutorials, prior to flying.

$review_text.: The case really looks rugged and will do a great job of protecting a hard drive. I ordered the orange color which was more like a safety yellow than orange but I'm ok with that. The interior lining and padding are very nice. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the hinge. It's a little thin and I could see it falling apart with repeated openings and closings. But the case has a tight closure that makes it feel very well made.Update: 11/10/13Still happy with the case. Hinge hasn't broken yet but I did trim out the raised logo portion of the interior padding as another reviewer had done. It was clearly putting additional pressure on the drive. I also store the drive in an anti-static bag before placing in the case. It's a nice snug fit without the pressure point that existed before.

$REVIEW.: Let me type this next sentence the way I would normally type, not by jamming down hard on the spacebar:This keyboard is notgreat when it comes totyping/Not sure what is up but a few days after getting it the spacebar just started sticking. It acts like it is not attached on the two ends, like a teeter totter. To get it to respond takes a pretty firm press. Quite a pain to type with. Slows me down a lot when trying to type.I liked the lit part of it enough that I thought I would try to just deal with it but I am now starting to look for a replacement.Also, I think there are a couple of other reviews that mention that sometimes the W key is just not responsive. That happens to me occasionally. I will be in BF3, trying to run and will just stand still sometimes. The keyboard seems to know when this loss of forward movement will cause me the worst possible outcome and it does it then.As soon as I tap the W again it works. Doesn't happen a ton but wish I would have listened to thereviews. Guessing it is too late to send it back.Also, doesn't work with my KVM.The programmable lights are cool but otherwise I was better off withmy normal low end keyboard.

$REVIEW.: I bought this Sony product as it synchronises with my Sony Ericsson mobile phone
The memory card is compatible for both


The 7.2 MP was also very appealing

The convenience of having one common card played out positively with use


However, the clarity I was looking for did not materialise with the 7.2 MP claim


a previous Sony camera with a 4-5 MP specification was not bad compared with this one

It is possible that there is a plateau in the graph of clarity and MP until it rises again


The technical department of Sony can better explain this matter.

$review_text.: I have had this camera for a few years and its been a pretty good camera for the most part
 Takes great pics outside, decent ones inside, not too great of ones in low light situations (bars, etc - but I do probably have a higher standard than most people)


 Have shot some great portraits of my son, and family members as well as skylines and nature scenes

 I like the fact it uses AA batteries so you can replace em at ease when needed
 The flash is about average for recharging between pics


 The onscreen navigation did take a while to figure out when I first got it (every model will) but was pretty reasonable and now I can get to whatever screen I need to in seconds.This camera also takes pretty decent movies as well
 In fact, I've gotten more and more used to the movie feature for many different things - including taking movies of my band


 This eats up a lot of space at the highest quality setting
 I wish I could post an example movie here, but you can get an idea of video & audio quality by checking out the movies on this band site (I set up the camera and let it play, keep in mind I had to compress so this isn't original quality but will give a basic idea) [...]So while there are many so so things and good things about this camera, a major disappointment has been the limitation on memory stick size

 I was going to give it 4 stars, but I'm taking one off because THE 8 GB STICK WILL NOT READ PROPERLY ON THIS CAMERA


 As such if you own this camera then all the good stuff is irrelevant if you want to shoot longer movies because Sony is not choosing to issue the firmware upgrade neccesary to enable the 8gb card to work in the H2.I guess they want you to upgrade to the H9

 That's too bad


 Apparently once you buy their product they don't care about retaining you anymore and would rather put the money into developing newer lines (that many people have said aren't as good due to too many megapixels)

 Please write Sony customer service and ask them to issue the firmware so they know us older customers do care and are not merely interested in buying the latest model.

I just carry the original with me because its still works! and it saves me every time i'm in a hurry !! the original charges super fast! you could go from 10% to 60% in like 15 minutes!!!!! while with this one it can take you up to an hour!!!

$REVIEW.: Going into digital photography, I had no idea what the factors were to look at, so I read a lot of materials about a lot of cameras. The ones that seemed to be the best were Nikon (which has an attachment for photographing slides), Canon, and (surprising to me) Kodak. The factors that turned me towards this camera were:1. 4.0 megapixels. 3.2 megapixels is the minimum to get decent pictures that print up well at sizes up to 8x12 inches. Different settings provide different formats in terms of relative dimensions, which may result in some cropping of your pictures (a 3x5 picture will be cropped compared to a 4x6 because of the different dimensions). You can set this camera to shoot at different resolutions, including 3.2 megapixels, which is ideal for shooting 4x6 inch photos. You can select sizes down to 1.2 megapixels, with corresponding losses in resolution and gains in the number of photos that can be stored on a memory card.2. Quality of the pictures. The resolution and color are excellent. I used it in Florence this last week without flash in the museums, and found that this camera is far better than film cameras with 400 speed film in picking up images.3. 4x optical zoom, which is significantly better than the 3x offered on most cameras in this price range. Anything more than that, and you'll get blurred pictures, unless you use a tripod.4. The camera is about the right size (many Asian manufacturers miniaturize their cameras to the point they are hard to use), and is comfortable to hold.5. Ease of use. The automatic setting will handle most situations, but the camera also has a large number of pre-settings and allows a limited amount of manual control.Like all digital cameras, you will have to buy several accessories to use this one properly, including:1. A large memory card. 512MB will store in excess of 350 pictures at fine resolution. Larger cards are now available, but the manual doesn't discuss them, which may mean they're incompatible with the camera.2. A charging dock, which will allow you to recharge the camera without removing the battery  by just plugging it into the dock. The DX 6000 charging dock will take voltage inputs between 110 and 240, which means you can use it overseas, provided you have the appropriate adapter.3. A larger battery (1750 mAh) to replace the 1050 mAh battery the camera comes with;4. A carrying case. Get the cheap small one [ASIN: B00006HXMQ]5. Hold off on buying a printer dock until you know whether you will actually use it. You may want to e-mail your photos to a printing service or use a drugstore kiosk.The camera comes with Kodak software, which I found useless. If you use Windows XP, your computer will recognize the camera as a memory device, allowing you to transfer pictures easily.

$REVIEW.: We bought the camera when it first came out at a big box store ( because the price was $299 everywhere).  So far the camera is easy to use but my one complaint is that for $300, you would think that Canon would include software to make videos.  ALL that is included (with poor directions and a wrong web address) is the Transfer utility LE and that only allows you to transfer your videos to your computer.  Cannot edit, burn to disc or any other option.  There is nothing in the product description about the lame software, that is why I'm making this review.  Had I known Canon only included software to transfer your videos I probably would not have bought it .. come on .. for $300 , you cannot include editing software ?

$REVIEW.: The ExpertPower 7.56" Dual Band Two-way Radio Antenna is an inexpensive upgrade for the popular UV-5R. While the improvement is not dramatic over the UV-5R's stock 4" antenna, it is noticeable on both bands. The antenna is well made especially for costing so little, is fexible, and it mates perfectly with the UV-5R's SMA-Male connector. I also own the Nagoya 701, and the ExpertPower antenna out performs it.One other note. I also own the new Baofeng UV-B5 Radio, which has a larger/better stock antenna than the original UV-5R. In comparing its antenna with the ExpertPower antenna, I noticed no difference. Both performed equally well.If you're looking for an inexpensive SMA-Female antenna, I definitely recommend the ExpertPower 7.56" Dual Band Two-way Radio Antenna. It doesn't perform any miracles, but it does work well.

$REVIEW.: I wanted a durable underwater / beach camera for a trip to Hawaii and didn't want to spend a lot of money.  I had used a cheap used 5 Meg pixel camera in an underwater pouch before.  Worked great, but the sand and salt destroyed to camera.  I decided give this camera a try.The first one was defective.  I sent it back to Fujifilm for warranty repair.  To their credit they simply replaced the camera.Pros:Small and easy to carry.I like the push button setup.  Easy to learn and gets you quickly to where you want to go.Videos were clear and made capturing some fun underwater moments of my kids and nieces.  Just need to remember to prefocus before shooting videos.  Focus on something in the distance and maintain relative distance from the subject and it comes out great.  Beach videos clear with good sound capture.  Videos of us snorkeling in deep water off Lanai and in Pupukea on Oahu were fantastic for the small lens of this camera.Cons:Need to add a wrist flotation device.  I found a good bright orange one that works.  Caution read the reviews; there are similar looking ones that aren't buoyant enough to hold it up.  I found this one on E-bay from an Australian merchant.Also the wrist strap got in the way when we went kayaking.  It keeps hitting the side of the kayak.  I was worried that it damage the camera or breaks off.  Need to add a neck strap as well.  This kind of camera needs quick and easy access to take pictures and not worry about environment around it.  Too hard to keep in pocket when kayaking.In bright light the display screen is nearly useless.  I had an old Minolta 35 mm underwater camera years ago.  It was bright yellow floated and had a strap on aiming target.  Would like to see some thing similar to help line up the camera to what you are photographing.Would like a dedicated button to switch between underwater and surface shooting modes.  It is a menu selection, but since this is an underwater camera, it would be handy to switch back and forth directly.Side note, I am very careful about rinsing the camera clean before opening the bottom.  But on one beach (Kailua) the sand is very fine.  It sounds like some got inside the under cover slider.  I can hear a grinding sound I haven't heard before.  Hopefully this will not affect the water tightness of the camera.
$SUMMARY.: Great camera, know limits

$REVIEW.: First of all, yes, the mount itself comes in two pieces...but who cares??  It's very solid/sturdy metal, and both sides are being screwed into studs!  The fact that it comes in two pieces is totally irrelevant unless they were spaced MUCH further apart, which doesn't apply here.* It's important to note that this mount does an *adequate* job as compared to mounts 5+ times the price, but it's not "the same" as an expensive mount.  I'll explain at the end.  That said, here are my gripes:-  As some reviewers have mentioned, it's quite difficult to get it even.  I used my own trusted level, and the mount itself was dead on even, however, once I mounted the TV it was clearly uneven.  I've mounted dozens of TV's, so it's not a matter of a lack of experience either.  The quality of the mounting brackets is sub-par.  The hooks sit uneven, and all 4 move individually, independent of each other, which is bad.  The two hooks on each side should move TOGETHER.  But instead of taking the entire mount off, repositioning it, drilling new holes, etc, etc...I simply took an appropriately sized spare allen wrench (I have a ton of them laying around) and placed it underneath the left "hook" of the mount....and presto, it's even.  The hook itself is still well attached so I'm not worried about it ever falling off, and you can't see the allen wrench in there at all.- It's nearly impossible to adjust the tilt angle once mounted.  I also see a lot of people complaining about the bottom screws.  Yes, if you want the mount angled fully downward like I have it, the screws on the bottom are impossible to reach, but honestly they're not necessary unless you have someone crazy over your house that decides to lift the TV up off the mount.  Other than that, thanks to the laws of gravity and the fact that TVs don't jump, the bottom screws are pointless.- Lastly, the TV doesn't sit as flush against the wall as I'd like.* I have an expensive mount for my 55" TV downstairs that I basically stole on black Friday - it was around $150, but due to some odd glitch I got it for $45.  The metal itself is pretty much of the same quality, but that's where the differences end.  You can see the difference in the overall quality of the brackets and tilt mechanism that mount to the TV itself - on the expensive mount, it's quite easy to tilt up and down once mounted, it sits completely even and has leveling adjustments that are easy to reach in case it isn't even.  It also it sits VERY snugly against the wall.So the verdict?  No, it's not quite the same as a more expensive mount as many people seem to be saying, but if you're on a budget and don't mind dealing with the few small snags I've mentioned, then this is worth it.
$review_summary.: Not as bad as many of the negative reviews indicate...

The low profile works well for Macro,low profile shooting and carries the weight of the D90 body with no slips or drifts.

$review_text.: A lot of my music is put on my computer straight from the cd, and I use Apple Lossless to get the best sound.  I had no idea how great Apple Lossless was until I heard it on this unit.  If you are like me and like to hear every nuance of a song, I recommend this music system.  Honestly, it sometimes sounds like I am in the middle of the performers.  You will notice portions of songs that you didn't notice before if you just listened to them on your computer or on an mp3 player.  Only drawback -- it seems that the unit constantly charges your iPod unless you remove the iPod from the unit.  Turning the unit "off" does not turn the iPod off, it seems.  But it is easy enough to remove it when it doesn't need charging and when you're not listening to it.

$REVIEW.: I know, I'm giving it 4 stars and recommending you look at something else instead, but here's the thought process...This is a great head, I used it for quite a while, but it's somewhat limited if you want complete 3D freedom. If you need to lock in you pan while you tilt, this works great, but I' found that I didn't really need to do that, I wanted more freedom, and thus the recommendation that you look at the 322RC2 grip. It's $120 instead of $35, but as the saying goes, you can pay me now, or you can pay me later.In either case, if you want the tilt-only action this head provides it's a great buy, if you want more freedom, look at the other one.

$REVIEW.: If you can find a pair of these at a very low price, below $20 then they are worth it. The sound is balanced, with detailed highs and warm bass that is not muddy. However, if you are active while listening and don't listen at high volume, the noise that is transmitted up the cloth cover to the ears is annoying. After several months of very light use, mine suddenly lost the right speaker almost completely. This has happened to other reviewers, so it is worth noting. The nature of the loss is such that I think that it may have happened while plugging them in. I would suggest making sure your source music is off while connecting as a precaution.

$review_text.: Ok my mistake it doesn't fit the PRST 1 or 2


I have the 2 that just got a few weeks ago


So needed a cover

I wish the seller would be clearer that it doesn't fit these models because it isn't
The fact it stated PRS...and slash TC I thought it meant it did
Having complained about that
The cover is a simple just folding cover with no clasp and no slot for a sytlus


But it fits the 600 models with a hardened center binding thing that has two slightly raised tips that somehow attaches to that model and holds it in place


I'll be removing this hard center piece and then adding elastic banding to the outter corners to hold the PRST2 in place


Many of those you buy use the elastic version to hold the corners in place
Also I may add a clasp to it and definitely will sew a strip of wide elastic banding to the center inside binder to hold the loose stylus that comes with the PRST2

It will work nicely and be very simple
Not everyone will have a sewing machine to do this


But I think someone else added just a thick elastic or rubber band to hold their PRST1 in place and the book closed


It isn't quite clear what their fix was beyond that

I can also use this as a pattern piece for size is just about right for my future needs to make my own version and I intended to do that all along

Though I didn't really need a pattern this still helps with it


And I've got leather/fabric/hardware such as magnetic insertable clasps and snaps and all things go with many different styles or themes on one of these
I do like the simple light weight size of this

I love almost all shades of brown and that includes this leather


A dark brown but true leather and true Sony item so quality is not compromised and stitching what little there is is neat and nice
For 3.99 to my door including shipping I have no complaints with service or item other than the seller needs to let people now this item is for the 600 series not the PRST models
Not everyone will be able to fix it like we do and not everyone will want to and to avoid returns due to false advertisement it only makes sense for Amazon and seller to step up and write a better description of what this fits and is intended to fit for readers


So here is my attempt to do so if they don't:))) But I'll get more than my 3.99 use out of this now DIY device.


$SUMMARY.: Does not FIT the PRST1 or 2

But very simple & quality item.

$REVIEW.: So first I wanted to point out that CAT6e doesn't exist. These cable categories are decided by the Telecommunications Industry Association, and they have NO specifications for CAT6e, only CAT6 and CAT6a. This is just a marketing tool, as you will see, so just be aware.Pros:-It works fine for everyday use-long cable should reach most places you need itCons:-Braided copper wires, not solid copper-Wires are thinner than other CAT6 cables I have used-Outer sheath is flimsy and will wear through easier than a normal CAT6 cable-Cable is very pliable and flimsy, the inner wires are very flimsy-CAT5 qualityOther thoughts:I am an IT professional that needed a few short cables for a job and went with this cheap stuff due to other reviewers ratings. I used this long cable to make a bunch of shorter cables with my own CAT6 RJ-45 ends so I can testify to the inner workings of this cable. The inner wires are braided copper and very flimsy - when you put an RJ-45 jack on the end of a cable there is about a half inch of inner wires exposed that you need to push into the end of the jack before crimping it. The inner wires would rarely stay rigid enough for me to do this. Solid copper inner wires conduct electricity better and are much more rigid and durable. I eventually got them on but the braided wires in this cable are about 50% as rigid and 70% as thick as compared to other CAT6 standard solid copper wires from more reputable sellers.In regards to the outer jacket sheath, it is very flimsy and after crimping an RJ-45 jack on the end of a few, it soon tore and left the inner wires exposed with little to no provoking. The only thing to give this cable and type of strength is the cross web that separates the twisted pairs.Overall the cable certainly works, but do not be deceived by the clever marketing and affordable price of this cable. Expect to get CAT5 standard performance and throughput from this cable.

$REVIEW.: EDIT 1-25-2013: I finally received placement speakers, which are the newer model of these
I am completely satisfied with Pioneer support, but the process took a while, partially due to my fault

It was hard to find a box and pack the speakers

I recommend you keep the box


In the new version, each tower speaker comes in separate box.EDIT 11-21-2012: A few weeks ago the tweeters suddenly "blew" (burn smell) in 3-4 towers during normal listening and I am working with Pioneer warranty


The bookshelves and center was fine

This is unacceptable and I believe the towers have a design flaw that caused this
I am using a Denon 2112ci AV receiver.EDIT 10-9-2012: A new model of these speakers have been released
I am not sure if they are better or worse (supposedly better)

The price of these will likely get to clearance status soon.I bought these speakers including the matching center channel and 2 bookshelf/surround for my system about 4 months ago
BestBuy had a deal where the whole package was $280 (no joke) and I jumped on it.Short version: These speakers are the best choice for someone on a budget.I spent a lot of agonizing research to find the best speakers...which is hard because you can't really test them before purchase

Thus, I do not know exactly how every speaker sound systems and can only judge what others have recommended in reviews and my expedience with these.Highlights/comments about these speakers:Watts/CompatibilityThey require the power output most AV receivers supply, meaning you are probably aren't going to over or under power them
A lot of more expensive speakers require separate amps and will not sound good with only a AV receiver

Fortunately, these are simply plug and play


The connectors allow banana plugs as well.Trebles/midsThey have a nice mid and lower range, which gives them a full sound

The comparison is smaller speakers (or even other bigger speakers) will have nice crisp sound, but it will start to sound harsh, bright, and irritating after a while

These speakers don't do that, but they still have "bearable" crisp highs

Some people actually prefer speakers that screech though and may be disappointed that these don't
The common complement for these speakers is that their mid range is superior to other speakers in this price range and well beyond.BassThey have a good bass that goes down to the right range, which is the range where your sub woofer pickups up on


Their base isn't "booming loud" because they don't go that low, but it is enough for you to think you have a subwoofer if you don't
I returned the matching Pioneer subwoofer because I didn't think it's "boom" is needed other than for explosions in movies (hearing "boom...boom...boom...boom.boom...boom..." in music gets tiresome after a while)

The bass WILL sound deep, especially if your receiver directs sound to all your other speakers (excluding or including a subwoofer), but you still need a subwoofer to pick the deepest lows or if you like hearing "booms" in regular listening

In fact, base is so powerful that I thought I had 2 12 inch subwoofers turned on when I later checked and realized they were off during a base test song (I thought their volume was low.Build qualityThese speakers are heavy and solid

They have a simple build with few components and there isn't anything to cause rattles

They ARE made in China though and not "solid oak" or anything (cheaper particle board with a thick finish actually), and don't have an expensive look (I didn't buy them for looks)

They have an "audio equipment look," which is likely a reason why they are so cheap


They are really bulky and clunky to someone who is used to smaller sleek looking speakers and some people may find this a turn off.Positioning/mountingI have a complaint here...the towers aren't that high on the floor and you have to place them on something to get them up to the recommended THX 5.1 surround level

If you place the towers on the same desk as your 55-60 inch TV, the tops will almost align with the top of your TV and be the right height

Otherwise, these speakers (including the surrounds and center) don't have any mounting options aside from drilling holes and installing your own custom brackets


I build my own speaker stands for the towers and the surrounds, and placed the center in the TV stand (which) I also built


I do not recommend these speakers for a home theater roomer smaller than 15x15 feet ad positioning is VERY important.ValueThese speakers are money well spent and you can't do better in terms of value


You can spend that extra money on a better AV Receiver or TV instead, which are arguably more important

These speakers are the "entry-level audiophile" choice and while you can spend more to get better "middle-level audiophile," your bang for the buck will go down exponentially, you may not hear the improvement, or (worse) you can buy really expensive speakers and be unhappy/stuck with them (these are cheap enough that this isn't a problem)

Unless you have an unlimited budget, you are doing yourself (and maybe your wife too :) ) a favor by buying these instead of breaking the bank on $500-$1000 single towers.

It would be so much better if the larger end was at one end and the pointed tip at the other end.

 they are comfortable and the sound is good, better than a $25 set of headphone should sound, they are very easy to put on and listen to for a few hours, the cord has a volume control at a good length on the cord, about chest level and the cord is about 2 times the thickness of a average headphone cable

$review_text.: Very good for the Kindle fire.  I always struggle with these things and these went on pretty well.  I struggled (as always) with laying it out just right the first time but was able to pull it up and replace it a couple of times until I had it just right.  The protectors don't leave a sticky residue and they cling to the screen with just the right amount of adhesion (i.e. it can be pulled off until it's lined up correctly and once in place, it adheres appropriately).I originally left a couple of small bubbles in it but was satisfied with the alignment so I left the bubbles.  Over the course of a couple of days, the bubbles worked themselves out.  Can't say the same for other screen protectors I've used on other devices.

$REVIEW.: I bought this as a well-recommended, less expesive alternative to an iPod.  It is tiny, light-weight, and looks easy to use.However, I have fought with it for a few weeks trying to load music onto it, and cannot get it to work.  The product came with no instructions besides a one-pager, which says that PC users should drag-and-drop music onto it by opening "My Computer" and double-clicking on the player icon and then "Internal Memory."  But there is no such icon called Internal Memory.  A note for support, FAQs, and forums directs the reader to [...], and when I try that, I get a "404 Error" stating that there is no such site (reader: please try and see if you get the same error).  Another note says the full user manual is available at [...], but a search there turns up no device called "clip zip".  There is a Sansa Clip (not zip) device listed, but it doesn't look like this device, and again, its instructions just say to drag and drop music into "Internal Memory."  The enclosed instruction page also lists no phone number to call for help.I also had trouble trying to get it to play in my car, which is the only reason I bought it in the first place.  I had to go to Radio Shack to buy a special cable to connect it to my USB port in my car stereo (the one supplied didn't work), but that now seems useless since I can't load songs onto it.  The only way it appears you can load music is to sign up to buy music through their "Rhapsody" software, even if you already own the songs you want on the player.  I installed Rhapsody to try that path as well, but couldn't copy from a CD to the Rhapsody "library."  An error message said to import the CD first (it won't let you import selected tracks; just the whole thing).  So I clicked Import CD, which it seemed to do, but still nothing appears in the "library."  Where did the music go?  Again, no instructions are available.I've also surfed around on forums to find answers, and it appears that a lot of people are having the same problems getting their devices to work in their car, and loading songs.  Why would a company sell an electronic device without instructions for use?  It is far from user friendly.  I've lost track of all the error messages I've seen trying to get it to do basic functions.  The error messages tell me I "can't do that," but they don't tell me how to do it the right way.Sadly, I'm now preparing to return this device and go back to iPod.  iPod may be way more expensive, but at least it works.

$review_text.: I had the Creative 30 gig unit and I felt as though all it ever did was "crash" on me. 32 days after I bought it, I had to send it in for repair! When it was under warranty, I would have to return it to Creative and wait for it to come back with all the data I uploaded gone. The iRiver is wonderful! It comes with EVERYTHING you need to operate it. A silcon case, Senhieser ear buds, etc. I am very happy with this unit. Yes, it is somewhat larger than an iPod but that doesn't bother me in the least (much smaller then the Creative so I'm still happy). Wonderful sound! It stores text and photos and it also has an FM radio that can be recorded from, as well as live recording capability (my Creative had none of these features). The iRiver is well worth the price (which was less than what I paid for the Creative, which is no longer under warranty and has crashed again and I'm through with it!) I will give Creative credit for their "Travel Sound" speakers. It's an excellent unit and I continue to use it with my iRiver MP3 player.

$review_text.: This is an excellent computer for the price point, especially being an "ultrabook." Technically it is called a sleekbook because it uses and AMD processor and not an Intel.I removed most of the bloatware with the exception of the HP power monitoring program. It's not necessary to keep, but it's easy to use.I won't go into too long of a review, but I'll try to cover some points that I feel that are important to note.Pros:-Light weight-Excellent battery life and charges very quickly-Quick start up-Able to play a few games after upgrading the ram to 8gb. I have played a few games through Steam like Portal 2, The Walking Dead, and Plants vs. Zombies. And they all play flawlessly with out having to adjust any settings.Cons:-Flimsy screen. I understand that this is an ultra thin computer, so I didn't expect it to hold up the same as a super thick standard laptop. But I expected it to withstand a little bit of abuse from going in and out of a case and on occasion, my 13 pound cat deciding to sleep on it when I'm not looking. All my previous non-ultrabook laptops have been abused much, much more and never had the screen crack and I have had some pretty cheap to moderately priced Acer and Toshiba laptops. So I am currently in the process of having a new screen replaced. Which brings me to another note for anyone who ever needs to replace the screen: HP wants $269 for parts, labor, and shipping. You can have this done for half the price and in a single day at a computer repair shop near you.-The beats audio software seems to eat up a TON of the ram and CPU usage. Turning it off makes a difference, but then when you want to listen to something it sounds HORRIBLE. So on it stays.- The touch pad is a little finicky and drives me up the wall at times. I'm fairly tech savvy, but I cannot for the life of me truly understand how the scrolling and zoom works with it.  Also, right clicking is a little weird on it too. Its not awful, but can be annoying if you aren't looking down at the pad when you are clicking away.-Lack of the 10 key pad. For a computer this wide, you would think it would have one. It's not something I require in a laptop, but definitely nice to have if you know how to use a 10 key pad efficiently.-Cursor jumping. HUGELY ANNOYING!!!I definitely recommend this laptop to anyone looking for an "ultrabook." For the price and what you get, I do not think you could do any better. The only thing is, you really should upgrade the RAM from 4 to 8 gb. It makes a world a difference on this laptop. A warning though, getting the bottom off requires a little finesse and getting the RAM to seat properly was a little bit of a challenge due to the tight space.Update 2/17/2013:This laptop is garbage. I was seriously impressed with it at first. Unfortunately after having this computer for less than six months, I want to go "Office Space" on it (up know, the part were they beat up the printer.)I had to send it back to HP to have them replace the hard drive after it getting corrupted AND now the screen bezel separated from the lid, separating everything that has been protecting the screen. Apparently this is a common issues with "ultrabooks." The innerds of the lid are made of plastic vs the MacBook Air, where they are made up of metal that can better support the lid and doesn't fall apart so easily.I am over ultrabooks and I am over HP. I am SO SORRY that I eeeever gave this computer a good review. Only time could tell :(

$review_text.: The bad news: Between voices following laryngectomy 2 weeks ago.The very good news: Wife Kathy got me a Boogie Board (BB) beforehand.By all accounts, it'll take several months and lots of practice to develop my new voice. (Thinking of going for a very distinguished British accent this time.) In the meantime, I've got my BB.In the hospital: A bedside BB allowed quick and easy direct communication with caregivers and visitors alike. Showing a sense of humor about the situation via BB put everyone around me at ease. Result: Better care, better visits, better quality of inpatient life. All who saw the BB in action said something akin to "Wow, what a cool idea! Where'd you get it?", and I'd scribble back, "wife amazon $40."  Under the circumstances, that exchange alone would have been next to impossible without the BB.Apparently, word of my BB spread quickly around the university medical center,  as the BB was soon drawing visitors of its own -- among them such luminaries as  the respective directors of intensive care, speech therapy, and respiration therapy; and ICU nurses assigned to other patients. I was able to converse comfortably with all of them. When my surgeon asked how I was doing on his first post-op visit, I scrawled, "OK, except I think I'm losing my voice." We all had a good laugh. On the spot, he ordered his chief resident to get a dozen for ENT department use. The BB had a similar effect on the medical center's CNO (chief nursing officer), who came by as a friend of Kathy's.At home: Turns out that the challenges of home life sans voice are many, varied, and often quite unexpected. The BB has vastly simplified and accelerated the retooling process for all concerned (except the dogs, who still don't understand what happened). Result: A safer, less stressful transition. Keeping it light via BB has paid royally.Expectation management: Like any other device, the BB has its strengths and weaknesses. Two things have made my little adventure an ideal BB application: (1) A fingernail's as good a stylus as any; and (2) no paper supply or dump needed.  Despite a lifetime of losing pens and pencils (one of my centers of excellence), I still have all 10 fingers. With my brain on some other planet most of the first 2 days post-op, it was all I could do to keep track of the BB itself. Anything more complicated than that, and I would have been isolated. Yes, BB readers will need some light to see what you've written, but that was certainly no problem in the hospital, where no lighting need is too small, and no hour too wee to turn on every light in the room.Other speechless moments: The BB also finds use in situations where speaking aloud might be inappropriate but passing the BB can be done discreetly.Tougher than you might think: Among the many insults endured while in the hospital: (1) At least a dozen falls from bed or bed stand to floor. (2) A variety of hard, heavy, and sharp-edged objects inadvertently placed on the writing surface, not always with the BB flat. (3) Fallout. (I'll spare you the details.) Once cleaned up, only a few minor scratches with no effect on legibility remain.The good and bad news about the battery: After 2 weeks of very heavy use, no sign of power failure. I would have preferred an easily replaced batttery, but you'll find at least one web site with do-it-yourself instructions.Thanks, Kathy.

The problem seems to be that these modules are designed specifically for Intel CPU's/motherboards and not AMD. I have checked the website specs for a few AMD motherboard manufacturers which seem to support this idea. None of them list PNY as compatible memory for their boards. I have since purchased a set of Kingston modules that will work. I hope this will help those who are considering this memory. The 4 star rating is for price point when compared to similar modules.

$review_text.: Sony DSXS210X Digital Media Receiver with Pandora streamQuick and brief review, this is a great innovation from Sony.  My Ipods 64g and 160g fit and work perfectly and it shuffles better in the Sony than when working on its own.  The adapter that I purchased made installation a breeze in my VW Eurovan. This Sony unit picks up the blue tooth signal in my Samsung phone without any problems.  It may be a bit complicated/difficult to remember the buttons for all of the functions, as these are not intuitive even with the manual. However, that is a small price to pay for all of the functions that this stereo offers. I am certainly pleased by not having to have wires dangling and the ipod moving around on the console of my vehicle. Furthermore, I often leave the Ipod in the stereo, because it is out of sight (granted, I do not advice this level of trust in high risk neighborhoods).  If you have an expensive stereo in you car, it may be difficult to make the switch to this unit.  But, if you have a cheap stock radio, this is the way to go. As far as reading the text in the face of the unit, yes, it could be a bit larger, but going from no text to small text... I am glad to have the small text.  Hope this helps you decide.

$review_text.: You get what you expect with this screen protector. I chose this because I was looking for an anti-glare, matte screen protector that would keep excessive fingerprints off the screen and to improve finger on screen movement. As far as that is concerned it was a great product. I knew from looking at other products and reviews that a matte finish will diminish screen resolution. The drop in screen sharpness became unbearable almost as soon as you try to watch a movie or show the device off to friends. It is a good screen protector that did its job but the view was not worth it. If screen resolution didn't matter then this would be a 5 out of 5, but considering the resolution of this device is one of the main reasons to buy the tablet, it might be a big problem.
$review_summary.: Adequate...But the screen is so beautiful without it.

$review_text.: I've lived with my 80" 857U for about a month now, so here are a few Pro/Con items on upgrading from a 70" 732 to the 80" 857U.ProIt's 10 inches larger!It's 50% brighter -- excellent for a well lit roomThe edge lighting doesn't produce the diamond pattern on bright, solid color backgroundsThe screen corners are not darkThe bezel is very small. It feels like it's nothing but screen.It's a better looking TV from a furniture perspective.It has 3D (not a big deal to me)The 3D glasses are blue tooth so you don't need to keep them pointed at the TV to maintain syncBetter IR sensitivity. The 732 was a bit picky about having the remote pointed in the right place10 point temperature calibrationThe OOTB default color calibration wasn't too bad in Movie modeConsThe battery in the 3D glasses isn't rechargeable.It's necessary to buy a battery every 100 hours (according to the manual)Flash lighting in the 4 corners. In my case, it actually looks more like corner clouding than traditional flash lighting. With my backlight set at -10 (at night), the corners aren't a problem, even in very dark scenes.Like all edge lit sets, the center of the screen isn't as bright as the edges. However, it takes a long exposure photo to see this issue.The Color Management has some issues. It's been impossible for me to get the blue primary calibrated correctly and still maintain the correct blue luminance.The Motion Enhancement settings above 120 High seem to affect color and gamma in ways that I find unacceptable. 240Hz in particular should be avoidedMoving contrast higher than 32 is going to start effecting colors. The set runs out of red at that point and your luminance balance will be off.Slight less contrast (using the ANSI contrast grid) than the 732. I haven't noticed this in watching TV, however.It's 50 pounds heavier than the 70" 732

$review_text.: I usually go straight to the bad reviews(1&2 Stars) because I know what I want and the 4&5 star reviews just tell you how awesome it is.  I want to know if it is junk.  So, if you are like me, you most likely will never see this review.Well, the low ratings for this product made it sound really bad, but I wouldn't expect a $60 Logitech product to be as bad as they made it sound.  It is not.  I figured maybe the bad reviews were older and the keyboard updated since then.  I think I was right, well at least the reviews were older.  So, I ordered one and it is really nice, much better than I expected.  All of the F-keys light up, not the actual F1, F2, F3, but above the F label there are icons on the keys for the programmable function of the key.  They are orange.  F1 has a house, F2 has an envelope, F3 has a magnifying lens and so on.  The software used to set the F-keys is very straight forward and simple.  The button in the upper right corner controls the brightness setting.  The settings are high, medium, low, and off.  The keys themselves do not take much pressure to depress and they are smooth with a slight 'click' when depressed fully.  I like the click, it lets me know I have fully engaged the key.  The keyboard is thin and the legs to prop it up aren't very tall so it doesn't prop up and change the angle much at all.  The keyboard also has some heft to it, it feels nicely built.  Fit and finish is good, there isn't too much light that makes it out between the keys, but there is some.  It also has volume control, and a media player control(play, forward, rewind).  Lastly, you have to have the software running in the background in order for the programmable functions to work.  I would definitely recommend this to others, if they are looking for a very good keyboard that doesn't break the bank.

$review_text.: I set this camera up within ten minutes and was using it shortly thereafter.  The camera is clear and the lighting/colors are well balanced so that I can use it with good lighting, as well as bad.  Occasionally, I'll have a problem with focus, but, with a little adjustment, it usually goes away.  However, the bigger problem is how flimsy the mount is.  I had trouble getting it onto my computer and it constantly felt like it was going to (and sometimes did) fall off.  Then, because the mount has a limited axis, I couldn't adjust the camera well...I would have to move the entire mount or computer.Nonetheless, for the price, this is worth it.  In conclusion: camera good, mount bad.

$REVIEW.: I am very pleased to get this docking stand

It solves most of the deficiencies of tablet ownership

Unfortunately it adds a bunch of unsightly wires that are not easy to hide
I wish there was a product that makes every accessory wireless

I bought a Windows tablet recently and immediately linked it with a wireless keyboard, but alas no convenient stand on which to prop up the tablet and also limited connectivity capability until this Belkin dock arrived.I like the powered USB 3.0 port - surprised to see that feature, in fact

I believe this docking station is primarily aimed toward the cooperate environment where Windows software is still ubiquitous
 My wife has an Anroid tablet and it's very good, but I still prefer Windows because I grew up with it
I'm retired now, but I can imagine how wonderful this docking stand would have been when I was traveling so much and preparing so many reports

I have been using full sized keyboards so long, I just can't do without them for any serious amount of typing
 I am a rather fast typist but not on virtual keyboards

And I much prefer a full sized monitor for my aging eyes
Except for the portability issue, I still prefer the equivalent of a full desktop computer.I could repeat all the features and connections, but that would be redundant


Everything works as advertised
If you have a Window tablet, this is an essential product to use with it.

$review_text.: I am completely satisfied with this router


Perhaps because I had lower expectations after reading some of the negative reviews, I was expecting some of the same issues, including dropped connections
I had none of those problems
I popped in the CD, followed the simple instructions, and was up in running in less than 15 minutes

The Network Magic software seemed helpful for my modest needs
It is the Pro version, which works for 7 days


After that, it defaults to the Basic version unless you purchase it for $39.95, which I didn't do

Basic is plenty adequate for my needs

And unlike others, I haven't been plagued with nag screens at all, asking me to upgrade

Maybe the newer version of the software doesn't do this.To me, the best thing that can be said for a router is that it becomes "transparent" to the user


It just works without incident


For the most part, this has been the case


Now, I am not trying to run a complex network off a $45 router, with a dozen wireless devices

I have a new desktop PC with Win 7 and two notebooks in the house
That's it


I just wanted it for notebook wireless access

The only real issue I had in the beginning is that when I was using my notebook computer, I noticed that the speed seemed to fluctuate from 54bps to 48, 36, 11, etc
I solved this by doing some research on the Linksys User Forum


I discovered that the default channel on the router is 6 and that others suggested switching it to 1 or 11 so as not to conflict with wireless phones, other networks in the neighborhood, etc


I did this, and my connect speed on my notebook has been rock solid at 54bps.As a side note, I avoid calling tech support at all cost


Most products now have user forums online, and I find that these are far more useful, less frustrating and more helpful than trying to talk to young Ramesh or Parmeshwar in India -- after a 50-minute wait on the phone

I went to the Linksys site, did a search on my issue in the user forum (fluctuating speed) and had the problem solved in 5 minutes.I am very pleased with this router and recommend it without hesitation.

My result is not perfect but it was a solution!I love the stitch-work and the exterior feels soft and cushioned. It looks elegant and classy (minus the spine I've altered haha).There is also a part (flap) on the bottom that you can open to serve as a laptop elevator. The button is magnetic and clips well.If this company makes a case specifically for the Chromebook one day, I'd definitely buy it!Overall, I'd recommend trying this case out if you're looking for a sleek way to carry your Macbook Air. It looks fairly expensive as well.If I ever get my hands on an Air, I'd definitely purchase this case again!

$REVIEW.: I've used these quite a bit and they are an excellent buy for the price. I highly doubt they get anywhere close to 18 miles. Maybe between two mountains with 0 obstructions, even then it's highly doubtful. I use these things for trips, airsoft events and the like. Radio traffic comes in clear, people hear me fine. The build is suitable considering the price point. No sub channels, but again, not really gonna get that for the price of these things.I've been pretty hard on these radios and they have held up pretty well. The ONLY negative thing I would complain about is the connector type for headsets and mics. It's nearly impossible to find a good quality headset or mic that actually uses this connector. It's really annoying. I finally found one, but part of the connector I had to order from China. Functionally, this radio is awesome, for aftermarket stuff, it might be kind of a pain to find quality headsets and mics. If your just looking for cheap connectors, it's fairly easy, but most I found ended up breaking pretty easily or performed terrible.But yea, good radios. Not a lot of compatibility connector wise. These are a good buy.

I was so satisfied with the sound and the quality that I bought another pair when my original J3's bit the dust.  I bought my second pair of J3's in June or July of 2012.  They lasted all of 2 months before one of the buds failed.  The environment in which these earbuds were used was the same as the original pair.  I listen to music and ebooks.  I don't blast the volume, I'd like to keep my hearing intact.  I like good sound and I try out several brands and pairs before I settle on ones that I like.  These J3's were it for me in 2010.  Now I've had to look for a better quality earbud.  Currently I'm using a pair of Philips SHE9000/28 and they are quite good and slightly cheaper.

$REVIEW.: This is the cheapest 12" flash softener I've seen. It also doesn't need a flash attachment like some others. It comes with a round case. similar to a small folding reflector. The only rigid part is the octagon frame, the neck holds its shape by the stiffness of the material (no rods). The softbox attaches around the flash head with flaps that have rows of rubber no-skid strips. An elastic strap with velcro ends wraps around the flaps and keeps the flaps tight on the head. The design makes it one of the most light weight attachments I've put on my flash, and the attachment seems sufficient. I do wonder how long the semi rigid neck will hold it's shape, but for now it works just fine. It can be used with an on-camera flash, just barely. With a D90 and SB600 flash, the bottom of the octagon dips below the lens shade of my 50mm 1.8 lens, but it doesn't actually show up in the photo. With my telephoto lenses it rests on the barrel. It's pretty easy and fast to mount to any standard flash head and doesn't add any noticable bulk or weight.Performance-wise, it's still a very small softbox, and can't replicate the softness of even a small studio softbox. It is slightly softer than bare flash on subjects fairly close. When testing it on my daughter, it was very similar to shooting without a softener, but little things like the shadows under her glasses were softer. As a fill-flash it helps make the lighting more subtle. As a key light, I'd want something bigger.

Very friendly staff.Turns out there was a Shure partner in New Delhi and I went to their location and they changed the phones for new ones on the spot


With two years manufacturers warranty, that's awesome.The design flaw still stands of course

I'm Shure they'll fix it.I wouldn't want to use another set of cans

These are just perfect.UPDATE: July 2012There is a metal T shaped hook that fits into the top (head) piece


Its held in place by a plastic cap covered by 4 small screws


This plastic cap has broken on my right cup and its about to break on  the left as well (I just checked).This plastic "cap" that holds down the metal T joint, is very easy to break
It broke on my right can and is almost broken on the left as well

Ive put up some pictures.I really think Shure needs to look into this and strengthen the design at the joints.These caps should've been made of metal
Mind you, I have used these phones VERY VERY carefully
I don't see these working in a real commercial studio environment.Apart from that still a great sounding pair of cans.______________________________________________________My mixes improved when i started using these cans.They do bring out reasonable mid range detail you want to hear when you're EQ'ing your mixes


They are decently transparent and have close to a flat response.To know exactly how the response of these cans are, search "Shure SRH440 + frequency response"They are reasonably flat upto say 3khz and then there's a dip from 3 to 8 khz followed by a spike to return to normal at say 10khz after which the response falls off.i did some research and chose these over the 840

A Shure engineer or something like that said these were better for mastering/mixing

You can google "Shure 440 vs 840" if you'd like to confirm.I just didn't really like the plastic feel of some of the connectors

I guess its not a big deal.I'll update this review next year to write on how it worked out for me.

$REVIEW.: This hard drive was for replacement for previous hard drive in a Dell XPS system. It is equivalent to the original drive and operated as expected. I then chose to remove this drive and replace original drive and will now use this drive in a build-my-own desktop system. I will write later on it's ease of setup, performance and overall functionality.9/9/11I chose to use this drive as a backup in my system. I am happy with it's performance, stability and reliability. I haven't had any problems. Access and transfer speeds are very good. Since it's identical as the original OS drive, it performs the same and it's very quiet too.Setup and versatility with this drive is easily accomplished. I may use it in a RAID array. I trust it for it's performance and reliability.

$review_text.: This is my first external hard drive. I wasn't sure what to expect but I am very pleased! Set up couldn't have been easier. Plug in the power plug & plug in the USB & the computer automatically recognized the drive.For someone who never used an external HD before, I wasn't sure if there was anything different. No directions come with it except how to plug it in. When you register the drive, it does provide a link to their support information & it was there I learned that I could simply drag & drop to the drive. Very convenient!I have an old computer so this will be great for storing my music, photos, etc. I plan to buy a new computer in the near future & this will make transferring files so much easier when I do. I don't hear any noise coming from the HD at all. Very happy with this!

$review_text.: I had read some of the other reviews before I purchased and am so glad that I got this unit plus the mounding arm for my desk.  It is quite sensitive and works really great with the Acer desktop computer that I also purchased shortly after.  I like that it has several inputs and also has USB3.0 on the side.  The panel is flush with the front glass so there are no edges to get in the way as you swipe your way through Windows 8.  You do not want to run a computer with Windows 8 without a touchscreen.  That is what makes Windows 8 so functional.  There is also a "START" button application that you can get so that the Windows 8 desktop is fully functional.  Something that Microsoft did not invent.  Back to the monitor, the sound is really clean and works well for my applications.  I do not use it for an entertainment computer, so some people may disagree.  It does not have a camera and microphone which would be a very nice addition.  Should have been included because it is not a cheap monitor.  It is what was advertised and I would recommend to anyone who is considering an all-in-one computer.  Buy this monitor and upgrade your computer to Windows 8, or use a laptop to drive the machine as long as you have an HDMI output as this is true HDMI quality.

$REVIEW.: This is a simple, and straightforward solution for folks looking to improve on the speed and reliability (or lack of) of their wireless network
I had been having a lot of issues with streaming video content to the TV in the basement via wi-fi--at hit or miss operation at best--and I figured that spending $40 on a powerline network adapter was preferable to hiring someone to fish an ethernet line through the walls from my router upstairs to the rec room in the basement

The good news is that powerline adapter works pretty well

Bandwidth is nowhere near 200 Mbps, though, and I wish I had opted to spend the extra money on the 500 Mbps version instead


There's no guarantee I would have achieved my desired bandwidth level, but the additional headroom couldn't hurt.

$SUMMARY.: Decent throughput, but I wish I had opted for the 500 Mbps version

$REVIEW.: I became adicted to photography with my 40D and after a year or so I started to see it's limitations. So I made the leap and bought the 5Dm2 and have been in love ever since. There are many technical reviews here and I recommend reading them all. This camera is not for everyone.Who this is for (in my humble opinion):- Those that primarily shoot in low light situations.- the benefits from full frame and the 5D's amazing ISOcapabilities are amazing. I have pics at 3200 ISO with no noise.- Portrait photographers.- The picture quality is unbeatable (unless you tack on anadditional couple grand or more for the 1D)- The 21.2 Mp gives you so much room to play withThose who this may not be the best option:- Sports photographers!- I still use my 40D for those senarios where I want a lotof fps. and reach. While the picture will always be betterwith the 5Dm2, 3.9fps is very slow in my opinion. Justsomething to consider.- The full frame vs crop factor is interesting and you willsee it first hand when you put your lenses on this baby.My 70-200 just became a walk around lense and has forcedme to beg my wife to buy the 100-400 and a 2x extender. My17-40 just became an amazing wide angle.Maybe it's just me but it seems that all of my lenses are so much sharper than before.So, that is my humble opinion. This camera is all that it's cracked up to be and I haven't even talked about the video capabilities. Definitely worth the money.

$REVIEW.: I've had this Poetic case for my Asus VivoTab RT for a few weeks now
 I hope to attach a video to give you a visual overview, but here are a few highlights:What I like:* Provides very good protection to the tablet* Works with or without the keyboard docking station* Very easy to use* Great cut-outs for all of the ports; everything you need is easily accessible* Includes a business card/ID slot, a flap for holding papers, and 2 pen/pencil/stylus holdersWhat I don't like:* Only 1 color option (black - wouldn't be my first choice)* Thick & heavy

 The tablet & keyboard combo measures about 0.75&#34; alone, but when used with this case, it swells to just under 2&#34; thick

 And with all of that case comes some unwelcome extra weight


 The combination really detracts from the overall portability of the tablet
 It would have been really nice if the case were quite a bit more svelte.I also have an Incipio slip-cover case, which is what I find myself using most often because this case is just so thick
Unfortunately, that case is only valuable for transporting & storing the tablet


Once you take it out, there is no protection, and the tablet alone is a bit awkward to hold

 That is a great reason to consider something like this Poetic folio case

 You'll need to decide what will work best for you

 As for me, the jury is still out, but despite its heft, this Poetic case is certainly a great value given the features and the price.

$REVIEW.: I bougth this fan about a year ago and i tend to leave my PC on for days at a time.  I've had other PC's and other heat sinks and never had an issue with the fan.I have an ASUS Mobo and keep seeing a pop up stating FAN speed - 0rpm. when i check the case the fan is spinning but i did notice its spinning slow. it goes a bit quick and slows down again.  Not sure if it's the fan or the mobo, therefore i'm replacing the fan and see if the problem goes away.As a heat sink goes... it's a big piece of aluminum and cooper piping, pretty much all the same if you ask me. the CPU runs at a cool temp also because its in a room in the basement.  the case fans draw enough air and if the heat sink isn't pulling the hot air, i think the air flow between the CPU and heatlink is cooling it just good.I have a big case, therefore i had no issues installing the heat sink.
$SUMMARY.: Good Heat Sink, watch for the fan

$REVIEW.: This wasn't quite what I expected.  I picked up a Hybrid a week before and was expecting something of similar size but with magnetic feet.  It's much, much smaller.  Yes, I should have looked at the specs, and that's not the fault of the product.  Still, it doesn't feel as robust as their other products as far as how solid the links are.  I've used it with smaller Speedlights (like the cheap Yongnuo ones) and it works OK so long as it's standing straight up; it's not strong enough to hold it at any kind of angle.  It does work quite well with my little point and shoot.  The magnets are quite strong.

$review_text.: The dimensions listed for this item say 11.5 x 8.5 x 1.5.  I have the leather snugg ipad2 case, and wanted this as another layer of protection when carring my iPad in  my work tote bag - since the iPad cases have all the openings...  The dimensions of my iPad in its snugg case are 9.5 x 7.5 x .875.  From the product dimensions , I was sure that this sleeve would fit my iPad in its snugg case, but it doesn't.  It slides in (tightly) but there is not enough room for it to zip shut.  I don't have this sleeve with me now to list its actual dimensions, but it certainly cannot be the listed 11.5 x 8.5 x 1.5!  If anyone wants to know the actual dimensions of this case, please post a comment and I'll measure it and list it here.  Note: the Fintie rotation iPad case on an iPad DOES fit into this sleeve.

$REVIEW.: Have come to a point where my laptop is also my desktop...yet, my laptop does not support a &#34;dock&#34; of any kind.  So...I made one!  This connects to laptop, and allows all other connections to be a single cable.  Works great - I lay it flat under my second monitor, which gives me access to 2 front-facing ports for mem-sticks.  Is VERY light - so plan on &#34;securing&#34; it, or it will slide around with wire movement.  At this point - I have printer, external HD, mouse, and kindle connection permanently running to it.  I can run an external video card (Sewell using Display Link driver) - but...it will lag slightly.  Definitely worth the money.

$review_text.: I love to swim about 2/3 times a week, its fun, relaxing but as for entertaining - sometimes I am fine with just my swim, but sometimes it becomes a little irritating when the gym plays its own music which is one of the most random mixes I have ever heard from Prince, to multiple plays of Mr Blue Sky (someone at my gym loves this song)  to some random 80s bands then rap!I researched water proof MP3s but most had terrible reviews, were rather bulky and would have meant I had to download yet more programs to my computer in order to operate...then I found this which fit the bill!! With an extensive iTunes collection - I could use this right out of the box, quickly upload my music which took mere minutes and I was good to go!!It is everything you know and love aboiut a shuffle! This is the perfect size for the pool, easy to use - yes the buttons are a little harder to press, but hey, its waterproof and that is what matters here right?! The sound is crisp, clear and makes swimming a lot more fun!I personally have no concerns about the headphones - if you research this, essentially they are throwing them in for free as their prices are the same as other sellers but those folks charge upwards of $30 for headphones in addition! I find the length just right (I clip the iPod  on to my swimsuit strap ) but you could also use with googles / swim hat and length is just right with enough give but not too much that it drags. I used the medium inserts (there is a choice of 3) and the size was right, the sound solid, they worked well above water and even better under; and the comfort is there.The other fun thing as a sideline - apparently no-one in my gym has ever seen this - so I have had a couple of startled folks yell that my ipod was in water - after all this is the real thing, the iPod shuffleWish I had found this sooner - great product!

$review_text.: If you are expecting Arri or Matthews quality you are going to be very disappointed. This is a cheap light set and I did not expect too much. The stands are okay. The first thing I noticed is the bag it comes in. Tried to open it up, the zipper got stuck, no big deal. It looks like the teeth came about on it. Go to unzip the other side, same thing. After a bit of shaking the zipper it's open. I pulled out the Key light stand, set it on the ground, the screw that locks the legs was hard to turn and would not lock it in place. It looks like it was bent. Okay, next I set up the rest of the stand for this Key light. The metal eye hole ring used to hook the sand bag fell off after taking some weight out of it and re-hooking it. Okay, I thought whatever. Really, I'm thinking I hope the rest goes better. I still have an open mind that this will work. I built the rest of the lighting setup and thought it's kinda junky, really hope it works. I have experience with some of the best professional equipment out there so I'm kinda comparing it even though it's apple and oranges but did not expect much. The problem is that if you know good equipment it's hard not to compare it. Set up my Key, fill & back lighting and fired them up. Yay, they all work. You are able to stop down the light by shutting half of it down, so two of the four lamps are lit. This is a nice feature. It was suppose to have (2) 24"X16" softboxes and (1) 16"x16". It came with (3) 24"X16", all the same, that's okay with me. So I whipped out my Canon SLR and put the dog up on the couch. At 100ASA, the depth of field was very shallow, blur from end of dogs nose to his eyes. Think it was 1/60 shutter & F1.8.  Flipped it to 400ASA, got about an f5 1/60 second. I had the fill and back and half power. I will experiment more but I do think it was pretty good for the price. It already has issues but hey, it works. What can you get for $150 bucks these days. I think one Matthews stand costs more. Yeah it's made cheap but think it's pretty good for your average photo/video hobby guy. You will be able to produce much better picture compared to a camera mounted flash.

$REVIEW.: Those ignorant of the true benefit of HDMI (being copy protection) are hood-winked by the hype and sales claims that HDMI cable design is so incredible, it provides audiophile and video quality as never heard before, (in the drive to justify huge price tags).Once the wave of newbie exaggeration died out, people began to realize that the ability to make good A/V cables preceded HDMI by many years, (and in fact most $5 cables are as good as those costing 10 times that) - especially when using the ears and eyes, as opposed to trusting a magazine's claim via employing some specialized equipment.But they also tossed in a revision to the spec allowing for audio return, 3D pass-thru, and even Ethernet, making each cable into an all-in-one "signal superhighway". By this time, most of us were expecting to hear the "ching-ching" sound over our favorite music.However, the "Mediabridge Ultra Series" cables are impressive in many ways. The manufacturing and materials used maintain very good signal integrity, isolation, and shielding as necessary. This is depicted in the online photos of the cable construction, as is the durable jacketing and molded ends which assure longevity. The gold plating and tight physical dimension tolerances grant a tight fit corrosion-free connection - with a solid feel.I am a skeptic when it comes to advertisement. The way to winning me over would be to then follow through with a product that equals the pitch, but sells at a decent price. I believe that these cables do that.I purchased a 1-meter and a 2-meter length cable to complete a recent upgrade to my Home Theater (HT) system. The other HT components utilizing these cables can make use of the added conductor paths, so I purchased them to allow for it. IMHO, they look and sound fine. I am pleased that these high quality cables not only provide the extra capabilities used by newer equipment, but also display superiority in their craftsmanship. They are reasonably priced among other cables costing much more - but delivering less. Great job Mediabridge.

$review_text.: I just received my Nikon 55-300 lens and after taking pictures for an afternoon would like to share my impressions and opinions about the lens.  I have had both the 55-200VR and the 70-300VR lens to compare it with.Things I like:1. Optically it is sharp with excellent color and contrast.  I would rate it on par with the 70-300.  Didn't do any extensive testing just compared pictures I have taken with both.2. Lighter & smaller than the 70-300.  Fits in camera bag better.  Used to carry the 70-300 in a separate case.3. Metal mount vs plastic mount on the 55-200 which was my biggest complaint with that lens.  (optically I was pleased with the pictures I got from the 55-200) and 100mm more reach than the 55-200.4. Solid, well built lens on par with other prosumer Nikon lens.5. Wider than the 70-300.  Equivalent of an 82.5-450mm vs 105-450mm.Things I don't like:1. Zoom action is a little sticky at the longer end.  Not as smooth as either the 70-300 or 55-200 lens.2. Slow auto focus.  About the same as the 55-200 slower than the 70-300.3. Manuel focus not as smooth as the 70-300 and harder to get precise focus.  No instant override of auto focus, have to move a switch.Overall I am pleased with the lens and will keep it.  I added the Canon 500D 2 element closeup lens and get excellent closeup pictures, maybe not macro lens quality but very good.  I also used the Nikon 3T & 4T close up lens with the 55-200 with excellent results.  I would have been willing to spend a little more for this lens to have the instant manuel focus overide and faster focus of the 70-300 and smoother zoom action which is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.  Which lens would I recommend?  If you do not plan to purchase an FX camera I would get this one over the 70-300 for a DX camera.  If you don't use a lot of telephoto and don't want to spend the money the 55-200 is an excellent alternative just be careful with the plastic lens mount.  I hope this helps anyone who is debating which lens to buy.

$REVIEW.: EDIT 9/4/12I unplugged the device from a Windows XP laptop and didn't use it for a few days.  When I went to use it again it took me a while to discover that the device had become disabled in the device manager.  I'm not sure what could have caused it, because it was working perfectly fine before that.  Deducting 1 star for the wonkiness that I'm seeing as I use it.  I also decided to open the unit up and found that they used heat conductive glue to attach a small aluminum square to the top of the Realtek chip.  I assume this is an attempt at keeping the chip cool.  However, it was glued on crooked and at an upward angle.  It wasn't doing very much good.EDIT 8/13/12The device caused a power surge on the USB port which caused Windows to shut the USB port down.  After rebooting it has not done it again after many hours of constant use.  I'm not sure what caused it.  I'm also not sure why another reviewer is saying this unit has two antennas?  It most definitely only has one.  Also it is no longer advertised as wireless N.  Throughput for me has been great, easily maxing out my 25mbps Internet speed.I have very few wireless AP's in my area.  With the exception of my router I only see about 4 close by APs using the built in wireless card in my older Dell laptop (B/G).  Using this device I see about 12 to 15 and most of them have 4-5 signal bars in the Windows XP wireless network display.  Granted this is not an accurate measure of performance but it is vastly improved over what I had before.I bet two of these would be great from an economical standpoint to setup up a wireless network bridge. Especially if you combined them with a tightly focused directional antenna and a high enough ACK timing setting.  While they have a high power output I don't think a 6DB omni antenna is going to get you a clean enough signal for good throughput to a distant AP that is also using an omni.  I bet a couple of parabolic dishes with line of sight could easily go for miles.  I tried using it with a make-shift ground plane but that actually hurt the performance.  I may try again later.  I also have an old DirecTv dish I might try using.The SMA connector is awesome because it lets you easily swap out the antenna or build your own without having to get adapters or open up the unit itself to connect some LMR-400.To install the adapter in Windows XP I just plugged in the USB cable and then manually browsed to specify the drivers for it.This works in Backtrack 5 and supports packet injection without needing to install any drivers.  The Realtek chipset is already supported.The unit gets a little bit warm to the touch but not hot. At a 1500mw rating I guess that is to be expected.  If putting it outdoors I might be concerned about how hot it would get in a sealed enclosure on a hot day.I can't comment on the user's manual as I didn't even bother reading it.

$review_text.: If you are familiar with the Canon T4i then you are already almost up to par on the 6D. I own the T4i and decided to go full frame with the new 6D. A lot of the T4i's menus and settings are closely akin to 6D's. I personally don't mind that the 6D doesn't have the fold out screen since I rarely used it on the T4i anyway. I do miss the touch screen however.The full frame advantage of the 6D at this price is awesome. I still use the T4i for most of my telephoto work since a crop camera provides a much longer work area. I also sometimes use the T4i for my macro work when I want a tighter shot. BUT the low light shooting ability of the 6D and the much brighter viewfinder will knock your socks off! The 6D is a low light king! The 6D's ability to shoot with lowlight and it's noise level at a minimum is simply outstanding... it outperforms all present competitors! The ISO performance is far beyond the T4i also.One reason I don't think the 6D even needs a foldout screen is because the ability to use iPhone or iPad as a control is really nice. Also the software that comes with the kit makes it possible to control the camera from a wifi connected laptop also. The GPS stamping is also top notch... and the mapping software is really nice.The feel of the 6D is also quite similar to the T4i being only a bit heavier but the weather seal on the 6D is an advantage also.So, all in all .... I have a great crop camera in the T4i... and a terrific full frame in the 6D.

$review_text.: As screen protectors go, you get what you pay for. The cheap ones last only a few months before the edges start to peel up. Protecting the screen on a $350 GPSr is important. If you register your Zagg screen protector, they will replace it for the lifetime of your Garmin for a small shipping cost. You will have to return the old protector to them. It's a great deal. The Garmin itself doesn't have a square screen, so lining up the protector with the various corners is very tricky. The only downside is that now I get weekly emails from Zagg advertising products. More clutter in my in box.

$REVIEW.: I bought this mount to hang my 55" Sony above my fireplace. As other reviewers have noted, the mount is pretty heavy and you will be impressed with the amount of nuts and bolts that it comes with. You will NOT be impressed with the instructions. One of the first things it tells you to do is to drill four holes into studs. Pretty cut and dry, no best practice or anything really. This is what I recommend:Put the arms on your tv FIRST!!!! The arms probalby will sit LOWER on your tv than you think. Once the arm is on, measure from the top of the hook piece on the arms to the top of the tv (for me this was 17") and to the bottom (13" for me). There isn't much adjustment to the arms (maybe one or two holes) so just pick one and moveon. Now when you PLAN on where are going to mount your tv (say over a fireplace), keep in mind the measurements from the top and from the bottom so you know where the tv will sit. I made the mistake of using holes that previous owners had which were WAY too high, I didn't account for the arms holding the tv higher (didn't measure).When you drill the holes, if over a fireplace, pick the studs that are closet to center, if it's not center it's ok, you CAN slide the tv left and right to make up the difference. Use your studfinder to find the center of those studs. I would drill the top two holes first, mount the Cheetah, and then put in the bolts (while using the handheld leveler included in the packing, don't rely on the one permanently in the mount. Now extend the Cheetah arm and drill the bottom holes and put the bolts in.Now hang the tv on the mount, slide the tv left and write on the mount to center it. Lock the allen wrench screws on the bottom to lock in the horizontal. Push the TV all the way and use a combination of the leveler and your own eyesight to determine the level. Using a socket wrench, there are four bolts on a plate on the arm that can be loosened. Once these are loose, you can tilt the tv CW or CCW to level it out, tighten the four bolts again. Now use the large black knobs to adjust the tilt.NOTE that there is WAY more hardware included that you probably need AND the bits and pieces are all labeled wrong vs the instructions.If you have a newer TV, you may not need anything besides the bolts for attaching to the wall.I hope that these instructions help someone avoid the errors I made. I love the mount, it's pretty friggin heavy, but it's high quality and looks really good. I just wish the instructions were clearer.

$REVIEW.: I got this to replace a 6 foot aux cable that was not coiled and was driving me crazy in my car.  It was looped around all over the place and actually melted in a spot when it was caught in the console.This cord is very tight and looks like it measures less than a foot all coiled up.  It doesn't have a lot of give which would be my only complaint.  I wanted it coiled, but I also want to be able to pick it up and use it when it's connected and that is just about impossible now.If you would like to minimize the space an aux cable takes up, this is the cord for you.

$review_text.: The Tru-Slim Frame is very nice looking

 The hookups are easy and plentiful

 The problem with this TV is that the picture sucks

 I have a 5-year old Sony LCD and it's picture looks ten times better


 I live in Chicago and have Comcast HD cable along with strong over the air signals so it's not the source

 I've messed with the picture controls for a week and I can't get a decent picture


I've tried both the component and HDMI inputs but they are basically the same quality

 It seems that the higher quality input the worse the output
If you watch the network news in the Standard mode like ABC, everyone looks like a cartoon

If you use the Sport mode everyone looks like they have bright lipstick on
This TV isn't worth $100.00 let alone $700.00


 In addition, if the picture is broadcast in the standard 4:3 ratio you can't expand the screen

 It says in the specs that you can control the aspect ratio but that's a lie

 Save your time and money and try something else


 I'm sending this POS back and ordering an LED-LCD like I was going to in the first place
This TV is JUNK!PS It took Amazon a week to ship it and Pilot another 10-days to deliver this POS.

$review_text.: The Giotto Rocket blaster is a decent size blower to clean camera (and similar) equipment
It does a nice job when used regularly, but is useless if your camera has been neglected for a while


Since there seems to be confusion / surprise about its size I added an image of the thing


The bulb is big enough and shaped properly to fit comfortably into my hand
The size of the bulb allows for quite a bit of air coming out the other end, which is a step up from my previous blower brush, however, that means it lives in a drawer in my desk or a dedicated pocket in my backpack, rather than my camera bag.

$review_text.: This little player is fantastic and the price is simply amazing.  Read the other reviews for all the features etc.  I only have one complaint, but it was not enough to drop it to 4 stars.  The "manual" included with the player is worse than awful and to make matters worse, Sansa tells you in that manual to go to their website at "[...]" to get the full manual and Sansa Media Converter (the converter is required if you want to watch videos).  The website location does not exist and even if you go to the home pages of sandisk.com or sansa.com, the links to this product don't contain manual, software or anything else of interest.  Amazing that a gazillion dollar company like SanDisk/Sansa has a website that is so poorly done.  In order to get the full owners guide and media converter, go to google.com and type in "Sansa Fuse manual" and you'll find the download in the first five or six links.  Do the same for the free converter and type "Sansa Media Converter" and it will be in the first five or six links.The Media Converter is pretty slick and easy to use and you can put in multiple movies to be converted in sequence so you don't have to babysit it.  The manual is informative and useful.Sound is fantastic, the video is great (even on this tiny screen) and the overall functionality of this device is better than anything else I have looked at.  I have already ordered a second one for my wife and will give them out for Christmas too!  Have fun!

$REVIEW.: The HDT-1 is an excellent tuner however being the initial offering from Sangean there were some annoyances like the display that could not be dimmed and no optical output.  Well these two issues have been addressed in the HDT-1X!  Other improvements like forced analog mode; split comparison between HD and analog signals; accurate time keeping; display that goes black when in the standby mode but you can push the INFO button and the time will come on and stay on for a few seconds.  The sensitivity of the tuner is superb as I live almost 50 miles north of NYC.  While I do not get all the HD stations, I pull in a fair number to cover the various music genres.  I am most satisfied and I am not a teckie, but I know a quality item; as I said this is my second Sangean tuner and I am enjoying it!  Buy it, but make sure you have a good FM antenna -- I am using an indoor whip antenna and a Magnum Signal Sleuth and I get HD stations -- imagine with a roof or attic antenna (I can't have either as I live in a townhouse). Of course if you live close to a large city like NYC you won't need any elaborate antenna!

My wife and I are professional wedding photographers, and we are forever having issues with our Canon flashes working consistently when remote


Many times the Canon systems will only work as line of sight, unless you are willing to drop a lot of money to upgrade to the new 600series flash
We have two Canon 580ex and three 430ex flashes, and these triggers work perfectly


All I really needed was a system that could help me light the dance floor even when people are blocking the line of sight
These triggers fit the bill, the fire all my flashes from hundreds of feet away, and even rooms away


The Ettl compatibility is great as now I don't have to set all my flashes manually and can do everything from my camera


These also blow my pocket wizard setup out of the water


They are less glitchy, work in about any configuration, and are way cheaper
Bottom line; if you need a systems that does not require line of sight, is simlpe to use, and uses Ettl, than these will not let you down


I love them, I am ordering more.

$REVIEW.: I ordered this cover for my son's iPad3; in part because of the reviews, and also because of the price. The cover makes handling the iPad so much easier. The cover has a nice texture to it and makes gripping the iPad very easy. It fits perfectly and the quality is excellent. I also ordered the Apple Smart cover and it works nicely in conjunction with it. I can only hope they will make one for the Apple iPad mini!
$review_summary.: Very Nice Cover

$REVIEW.: I bought 3 of these so I can have them mounted on the side of my case. I drilled 3 70mm Holes into the side and mounted them with three silverstone 80mm dust filters. Even with the filters getting in the way of the airflow these thing push like champs. If I ever need more LED fans I will go with these every time. They are bright. They are powerful. They are surprisingly quiet. I love them.
$SUMMARY.: Fast, Powerfu, and quiet.

$REVIEW.: Even though you can buy this Navigon GPS on Amazon, don't. The company no longer operates in the U.S. and you won't get support or updates. You will be left out in the cold with nothing to do but return the unit to Amazon. Instead check out the various GPS's from Magellan (the 1440 is a great unit), Garmin or TomTom.Navigon now only makes an app for the iPhone 3G or 3GS for North America, but I'm reluctant to even try it, since they closed their doors in the U.S. in a flash, leaving users of their GPS's supportless.

$REVIEW.: The best thing about changing lenses is that if feels like a different camera each time. This lens is really fun... when you're zooming in and out with your feet, it really changes the way you compose shots. Great depth of field, awesome low light performance, and the apparent focal length (52mm) is ideal for a great many uses. I've found it to be pretty sharp wide open, but sharpest at f/2.8... still very fast. This lens is also perfect to throw on your camera for that family party, when you can't be all into your "photography".... focuses fast and gives you great shots in that low indoor light with a nice soft background.If your looking for a great general purpose fast prime, this lens is perfect. The 35mm focal length (52mm apparent) is a little better suited to the DX format than the 50mm (75mm apparent) in my opinion... works a little better indoors.Build quality is as about as good as it gets with a plastic lens. Metal construction would obviously make this lens feel more substantial, but it would also make it much heavier. This lens is light! Great walk around lens. I have this on a D90.... great lightweight (carring it around your neck all day) combination.You'll find yourself using this lens more than you thought. I'd recomend it to anyone.
$review_summary.: Great all-around prime lens!

$review_text.: The bad first: 1) Just bought it, and was very disappointed when I turned it on and the colors looked washed out, no matter what I did. I had heard so much about the presumably beautiful screen and I just don't see it. The colors are not dynamic at all, just drab, compared to the beautiful,  vivid screen on my galaxy S2 phone. ( I am longingly viewing the two and comparing them as I write this. Where has all the vibrancy gone on the tablet screen...) Chatted with Samsung online, recommendation was to reset the tab, which I did but but it made no difference. Anyone have a remedy? 2)Lack of a micro hdmi slot for hd tv connection. Although I knew this was not a built in feature, I did not know that you cannot even get a decent HDMI adapter for it the way you can for other tablets. 3)Why no apps can be moved to the micro sd card is a mystery to me. Should be easy to fix? 4)I have not (yet)discovered a way to download videos etc. to the external sd card directy. When I download videos, pix, music etc.  I have to download to the internal memory and then use cut and past via 'my files'. At least that's what I've been doing. So the internal memory fills up very fast and you have to keep moving things. Is there a way to download directly to external card?The good: 1)I love the 'allshareService' app, eliminates some of the hdmi connection peeve I have. I can play my media files on my sony tv at the touch of a button, full screen, beautifully done, but the tv has to be capable of receiving files. Don't know if this is a Samsung app or if it is part of the ICS package. 2) wifi and cpu works very fast, no glitches as others have mentioned. I had several downloads going at the same time last night as well as using the tab for other things and it worked like a charm, no hang ups etc. 3) Overall works very smoothly, and has a nice intuitive feel. Feels 'coordinated' in terms of all the different features, very easy to navigate. 4) Love that you can change fonts for your tablet. I used to have this feature on my old LG dlite phone and am delighted to see it on my new tab. 5) Online manual is well organized and covers the main questions well. Its easy to download to the tab. 6) Battery lasts longer than I anticipated, can't put an hour value on it but I used it heavily for hours yesterday without charging.So, overall, it is an excellent tab, but I really expected, and want, a more vibrant color scheme on my screen and there does not seem to be an option to adjust that.Edit: So disappointing: Three days after writing this review, the 'allshareService'application,which I loved because it allowed me to stream easily from tab to sony google tv to my galaxy S2 phone, was no longer to be found on my tablet. Called tech support four times, they said the issue was 'elevated to the next level' as it appeared the app had become deactivated and they had to find a way to reactivate it. They finally said the allshareService app had been discontinued (not aailable for download anywhere)and that only a new app, called 'allshare play' is now available. Well, guess what: allshare play is not compatible with my google tv and, even worse, my Samsung s2 phone does not recognize "allshare play" so I just lost the easiest and most important function I had for streaming of video, music ect. on this tab. It turns out "allshare play' is only compatible with two or three Samsung devices. Beware!! I just lost the main reason for liking this tab.
$SUMMARY.: Discovering new features...and allshare function has disappeared. (see edit)t.

$review_text.: I waited until after my Kindle Fire arrived to order a case for 2 reasons1) I wanted to get a feel for the device before I decided what I needed2) Based on my experiences with my other tablets, first run cases are usually pretty basic and overpriced, so I wanted to see what else would come outAfter my Fire came I quickly relized I didn't feel safe just throwing it in my purse without any protection. I ordered a sleeve and this Amazon Basics stand, thinking that Amazon knows their products and is usually smart enough to see what works well with existing ones before they come out with or promote their own.Verdict:a) This thing is too bulky. It's not the most efficient design at all. You could come up with something equally safe and equally useful that doesn't make it so huge. The Fire all on its own is a little thicker and heavier than it needs to be, and when you add this case, it's like carrying around a brick. On my iPad I have a case with a built-in keyboard and that entire thing is still slimmer than the fire with this plain case.b) The elastic holders are too tight. They are so tight that once you get the Fire wedged in, you are constantly afraid it will pop back out. This is not so nice.c) Does the stand work? Kind of. Friction might hold it in place, but it seems like the Fire plus the case backing are too thick for the grooves in the stand. Mine slid right out of the most upright one immediately.$25 was tempting for a case - real leather! Amazon! But no. $25 is way too much if you immediately hate the case. I'm still deciding if I might return it. I've ordered one of the other brands (which has the hand holding strap on the back and fewer parts) and until it gets here I will probably just carry the Fire in the sleeve I'd ordered (Vertek).Please note, I have used a number of tablets with a variety of different types of cases and covers and this is the worst bulk to device ratio I have ever seen. Very disappointed.

$REVIEW.: This camera reminds me of another that I own, a Kodak Easyshare Z5010, in both style and functionality, and that isn't a good thing.I'll start off with the basics
 The zoom is impressive


 The bulkiness of the camera is exactly what I want in a camera
 I'm not a pocket cam person and like the feel of a nice sturdy well built machine that feels good in my hands

 It uses regular AA batteries, rechargable or alkaline, BUT, the compartment is a pain in the neck to open and close, EXACTLY like my Kodak
 Plus, the SD card compartment is only accessible by opening the battery compartment

 I hate plugging the camera in to offload my pics and love that I can just slide the SD card into the reader provided on my pc


 I dread the thought of opening & closing the battery compartment

 I don't even want to deal with that when I need to change the batteries!  Another major annoyance for me is the lack of a view finder

 I admit to being old school when taking pics; I prefer to look through the view finder and not deal with not being able to see the darn LCD screen, especially in bright light.I'm also in the habit of comparing this camera to another Sony, a Cyber-shot, which IMO, is the best camera I have ever owned, the DSC-HX30V (comparable to the HX20V as well)

 I tried hard not to do a comparison, but each and every time, I ended up doing just that
 That camera takes phenomenal pictures, even in low light

 Compared to that camera, this takes lousy shots

 Some shots don't focus properly
 Low light shots are blurry.I've been playing with the Sweep 360 function and have yet to get one that is a perfect 360, but it's still a cool feature.All in all, I would not recommend this camera

 Other than it being easy to use, it just doesn't take good enough pictures
 Even as a starter camera, I just don't think I'd be happy, and there are plenty of other options to choose from for the money


 My 12yo also loves taking pictures and does a great job
 She has also played with and tested a few of my cameras, and this one is also on her least favorite list

 I expected more from a Sony product, especially since I own another Sony camera.

I was very tired of having my nice but HUGE Yamaha towers dominating my living room.Well I was NOT dissapointed at all!I don't know if the reviewers that gave a negative review actually had the speakers (I tend to think they did not), or had a hearing impairment, but these things are INCREDIBLE!

$review_text.: I installed this on an AM3 board running a Phenom x4 965BE. I am about an hour into a Prime 95 torture test and the CPU temp is holding under 50C with room temp about 70F, so it is definitely working fine for me. AM3 mounting doesn't go the same way as the intel ones referenced in the other reviews - it doesn't screw in, it uses the lugs next to the cpu to hold it in just like the retail box CPU cooler. That's a positive and a negative - for AM2/AM3 it does *NOT* require you to remove your Mobo, but at the same time the mounting pressure is clearly less than what the intel guys can get so presumably the temperatures are a little higher than they could be.As far as the cooler itself, OMG is this thing huge- it will take up your entire 4U case top to bottom, with not enough room to spare for a 80cm side fan, if they overlap locations at all. On my motherboard I had to mount the cooler with the fan blowing up towards the power supply rather than my preferred direction of towards the back of the case. Seems to work ok, but i have a PSU with a bottom mounted fan, which probably helps.

$REVIEW.: First let me say that the color isn't quite accurately depicted by the photo, it's more pale than it appears

I ordered "blue" and the actual skin is translucent with a hint of blue

 Personally, I prefer how it looks in person over how it looks in the photo, so I am more pleased with it than I expected to be
 It fits perfectly
 All of the ports are accessible, the only minimal interference is on the volume rocker, but by no fault of the skin


 The volume rocker is positioned pretty near to the front surface, leaving little room for the skin to surround the edge of the tablet in that area
 I can still work the volume fine

 I also own a leather-like case, but this skin is easier to hold than the bulky case, so I prefer it for general/home use
 Very happy with this product, great deal.

They never fall off; but when I needed to remove one, I was able to do so without leaving a marred surface. If you have a even a  small smooth mounting point, this is a far better approach for mounting a Garmin Nuvi than using either the suction mount or the suction mount combined with a weighted mounting surface.

This case enables me to use the ipad wherever I want without being absolutely scared that I will break a $500 device. I have also dropped it several times since I put this case on, no damage was taken to the device or the case at all.

$REVIEW.: This keyboard has a nice feel and a sensible layout, but keyboards are a very personal thing, and this one may drive some people nuts.Even with the tilt-up legs extended, it sits very flat on the desk. If you (and your fingers) are accustomed to a "high rise" keyboard (like the original Mac keyboards and the newer white Apple keyboards), then this might not be your keyboard.The mouse is an odd shape but is comfortable and easy to use. It is clearly designed for "righties", however.

$REVIEW.: Right out of the package I was a little skeptical about how this flimsy looking thing was going to pick up any tv signal at all.  I ended up installing it on the wall directly behind my tv, completely out of sight.  After doing a channel scan...wow, was all I could think.  I ended up getting more channels than I had with the $25 RCA I was using and the channels were much clearer with no signal interruption while watching tv.  The only problem I had was that when my A/C came on the signal would become worse.  I guess this is because of the vibrations in the wall.  I haven't tried to fix this, but I'm sure just moving it to a new location would probably work.

$REVIEW.: If there would be one complaint with the Defender I would say the it's the video quality. The video is comparable to those rather grainy surveillance cameras you may have seen on your hi-def unit at home when they show 7-11 robberies etc. That said, I wasn't really expecting 1080P out of this unit, it is what it is. It lets you see what is going on around the outside of your house. It helps to adjust the settings to high quality but it is still rather poor. The unit is relatively easy to set up which is a major plus as it includes the needed hardware to mount your camera and detailed instructions on setting up your receiver and how to operate the features of both receiver and camera. There is 24/7 lifetime customer support although I haven't had a need to use them yet. I have tried it in two different locations to see the difference and there was a minor difference in the area that received more night time light. It comes with a 2GB SD card so you may want to put a larger one in for convenience,otherwise you can delete as the card holds 340 minutes. If you need additional cameras the Defender allows up to four cameras if you need more areas under the watchful, motion detector eye of the Defender.I am new to having a security system at home, so the hookup for a novice is fine I believe. If you have a business, this may not be the unit for you, as you may want a little more of an elaborate system, although this one works just fine. All in all I think this Defender is the near perfect , slightly grainy electronic eye you may want observing what is happening around your home at night or while you are away. Recommended for those that don't want to break the bank but want to feel secure.

$review_text.: I bought a GPS two years ago and bought into their three-year warranty (not "2-Year Electronics Warranty" as the reference says, for the GPS cost me more than $100), not thinking about it much until my unit no longer had sound/voice
 It took me quite a while to dig out the paper trail and contacted them

 By logging into their site under my e-mail by which I bought the GPS and their warranty, my item did show up

 Their verification process was a little complicated, in particular the way they wanted you to enter the DATE


 You could not enter it by typing the numbers
 You had to move very tiny arrows on a very small calendar module they wanted you to click

 And their default start date is way back in 1990
 So, to move month by month, I spent about ten minutes (or felt like that long) to get to the right year, month and date.After that, though, things are very smooth

 They sent me an e-mail to acknowledge the warranty, and a link for me to try to fix the GPS
 When I acted on their advice and failed to fix the GPS, they promptly sent me a pre-paid shipping label to ship the GPS back


 On the same day I shipped the GPS via UPS, I received the credit (I selected Amazon credit)

 It is hassle free after all

 So, next time, I am more ready to consider a SqaureTrade warranty


 The loss of one star is due to that small web module they forced me to move around to the right DATE

 They should hire a better, more customer-orientated web programmer.

$REVIEW.: I'm very happy with the S5 I bought to replace an S3 -- except, as noted elesewhere, I hate that the SD card is now in the battery compartment. The hot shoe (external flash socket) is a HUGE help, since the builtin flash on these cameras is pretty wimpy. The camera takes unbelievably good pictures and has excellent first shot and shot-to-shot times (it helps if you use the Energizer e2 Lithium Batteries). Although the S5 weighs about 4 oz more than the S3 (About 20 oz vs 16 oz inclding batteries), its construction "feels more rugged."BTW, I don't know that you need to wait for larger cards for bigger movies, etc. I use an 8gb SDHC card now. Be careful, though, which SDHC cards you get. Even with Sandisk's attempt to standardize the speeds, I found that an A-Data "class 6" SDHC card was about 25-35% of the speed of my Transcend class 6 card.  Also, remember that you need an SDHC card reader (I got mine from meritline for $5).

I have purchased hundreds of Linksys units and I can not ever recall having a serious failure.I bought a boxfull of these little adapters for quick hookups for laptops not normally connected to the network. They are fast connect right away and just plain work.The only thing I have noticed about these are that they are more sensitive to cordless phones than the PC card adapters. I have no idea why, but they will drop off in the vicinity of Panasonic and Uniden phones. Sony and ATT phones don't bother it. Go figure.

$review_text.: UPDATE #2In addition to purchasing the 50" SE50UY04, I went ahead and purchased the SE39UY04 as well. I put the 50" in the Living Room replacing the Samsung 40" and I'm now using the 39" Seiki as the monitor on my computerObservations of the 39":1 - It too suffered from the intermittent blank-out that was present on my 50" Seiki. Like the 50" Seiki, a firmware update corrected the issue and I can game/surf the net for hours with no problems*2 - Here's the reason for the asterisk, above. After about 4 or 5 hours of gaming/surfing/watching DVDs, the TV pops up a notification that it will auto-power-off in 60 seconds unless I press a button on the Remote (or on the TV itself) This option is not something I can disable and, when the notification box appears in the middle of an epic battle in Path of Exile, it can be annoying. I have contacted Seiki about the possibility of making this a selectable option in the menu via a firmware update but I have not heard back from them regarding this issue.3 - The 30" Seiki required a bit more tweaking to dial in the color to where I like it. Not that it was a "big deal", mind you, it's just something I thought I'd mention in case someone bought it and decided that, "out of the box" the colors were "off". There are plenty of online calibration sites available, and Windows itself has a monitor color calibration wizard that I used, then I tweaked it a little bit more.4 - Using the 39" as a computer monitor, versus the 50", is a better fit for me as I am not craning my neck to see the top of the screen anymore. My neck is far less fatigued after several hours of use than it was when I used the 50" Seiki.5 - Even though the remote control for the 50" is "serviceable". the remote control unit for the 39" Seiki is far better. It's got a better layout, different sized buttons so you can tell, by feel alone, which buttons you're trying to manipulateI cannot create a product review on the 39" Seiki. Amazon seems to think that this review of the 50" serves the same as a review for the 39" Seiki, so they won't let me post a review of the 39" Seiki since this review of the 50 Seiki exists...odd.UPDATE #1 When I purchased this unit and came here to post my review, there were 2 reviews here that gave the unit 3 stars and 1 star. For whatever reason, they are now gone. While I have nothing but praise for the item, those dissenting voices should be heard as well. so keep in mind there were 2 people who did not think it was a great TV.Personal note on those two reviews: The reviewers were idiots who failed to do their homework before their purchase and never even color calibrated the unit and then tried to compare it to their $5k+ top of the line, comes with a happy ending included plasma, but at least they spoke up and provided some entertainment value to the debateI purchased this unit several weeks ago and it came in last week. I bought it to replace the Dell U3011 30" LCD Monitor on my computer in order to gain some sorely needed real estate.I cannot say enough good things about it. It has so little light bleed that I had to hunt for it to find any at all. (rare for any TV in this price range)The colors are crisp clear and vibrant. Blacks were decent, not great. (You should access the Service Menu and turn down the backlight a little. It really helps)Picture Quality on my BluRays and BluRay Rips is great. Even 10-bit 720p content looks great on this panel. It's awesome to have a full web page open while watching a movie playing in a 39" diagonal window (yeah, I actually measured it with a tape measure)As a tool for improving productivity, it's great. I can have 3 large spreadsheets open along with MS Access and I'm not spending half my time minimizing and maximizing windows.On a lark, I installed Total Annihilation to see how it would handle a 16 year old computer game and the picture was amazing (TA will run at the panel's native resolution). I have also played 7-8 hours each in Skyrim, FONV, Max Payne 3, Bioshock1,2, and Inifinite and the picture quality is awesome.One note: Running the Unengine Valley benchmark at 3840x2160 resolution at Ultra Settings with 8xAA causes much distress to my Crossfire 7970s. They aren't happy at all at having to work that hard, so I had to drop 8xAA down to 2xAA.I wasn't sure if I could live with a 30Hz refresh at 3840x2160 but after a week of using it I placed my U3011 up for sale, and I haven't looked back.The initial version of the Firmware mine came with had an issue where the resolution reset itself at random intervals. The screen would go black and, in about 2-3 seconds would reappear as if nothing had happened. Turns out a Firmware upgrade resolved the issue, and from the time I reported the issue it only took 1 day for them to correct it. Seiki seems to be very responsive to the needs of their customers and I applaud them for working out a solution as quickly as they did. I'm still waiting on Samsung to respond to the email I sent them 9 months ago about a minor issue I have with the menu on my Smart TV...go figureThere are no bells and whistles on this unit. You get a panel, some speakers, and a fair amount of connectivity options. That's it. turns out, that's really all you need. Seiki isn't trying to cram 200 options down your throat that you'll never use and charge an additional $3k for them.I hope more people take advantage of what has been a surprisingly great TV deal so that it sends a clear message to other mfgrs that they need to concentrate on getting 4k2k rolled out for less than $25k per TV (Sony, WTF are you thinking?!?!?!)

$review_text.: I bought two monitors here on Amazon and one of them had a stuck pixel
Amazon agreed to send me a new one and let me keep the defective one until the new one came
The defective one still worked mostly, so once I got the replacement for a brief and the first time in my life, I was able to have three monitors of all the same model


My graphics card has the DVI ports and an HDMI port, so I tried using those to hook up all three monitors at the same time, however it didn't work.After some research it turns out that you need to use a display port(which my graphics card also has) to do that


So I went to Best Buy and bought one


Apparently you need an active adapter in order to use three monitors with EyeFinity how I wanted, and the one at Best Buy was only a passive adapter.So I bought this one and hooked it up, and everything worked beautifully
I was able to set ATI's EyeFinity to use all three monitors
Sadly, it just extended one desktop across all three monitors, so my start menu was on the left side of the left monitor and the clock was on the right side of the right monitor

It also maximized windows completely across all three monitors, which was extremely weird especially when browsing the web
I couldn't figure out anyway to have them all act as separate monitors like you can with only two monitors

Anyway, that's not a fault of this adapter, I believe that's just how EyeFinity is.This adapter worked great and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs one.

$review_text.: I just got home from a week on the road with the family. We traveled all over the state visiting family and taking the kids to different attractions. While traveling, I used my iPhone as our GPS in the car, and my iPad Mini replaced bringing along a laptop. Before leaving I charged up this Patriot FUEL+ battery and packed it in my backpack in the car so I would have always have some extra juice for my electronics while on the road. Boy am I glad I did!Both of my kids hogged the two car charging outlets for powering up and running their video games (Nintendo DS and PSP). So right away ended up needing to use this FUEL+ battery pack to charge my iPhone. Hours traveling by car every day and using the GPS mapping application to give us directions ran the battery down on my phone FAST. So as soon as it would get to about 20%, I would plug it into this FUEL+ battery pack and I was able to fully charge my phone and keep using it for the rest of the day. I also used it on a few occasions to charge up my iPad Mini, and several other devices that we brought along.With 4 of us in the car for a week, all having cell phones, MP3 players, the kids having handheld gaming systems and such, the two charging ports built into the car were not nearly enough for everyone's devices. So while my husband and kids all fought over who was going to use the charging ports next, I had my FUEL+ battery pack to keep my stuff powered. When it would get low or run our of power (about every two days), I would charge it at the hotel that night, then have it all charged up and ready for anything I needed it for that next day.It's small enough that it easily fits inside my handbag. So several times on our trip I plugged my phone in to charge from this battery pack, then placed it inside my handbag while we were out doing stuff. My iPhone was charging up in my bag, and I didn't need to leave my phone in the car to charge from the car charging ports. The FUEL+ battery pack lets me to keep my phone with me, so I can still use it, just as I would if I was at home charging my phone from a wall/USB charger.There are small blue LED lights on the side of this battery pack that tell you how much power it still has available. You just press the small button beside the lights and it will light up, showing you how much power you still have available. It's very simple to use and is a must-have for smart phone users when traveling!A sample unit was provided for reviewing purposes.
$SUMMARY.: Took this battery with me for a week on the road

$review_text.: My Bose Triport earbuds took a trip through the washing machine and didn't survive, and after reading several reviews I chose these as a replacement

I wanted to get something with excellent sound quality but didn't want to spend hundreds on earbuds as they tend to take some abuse (being hauled around in a pocket, worn while running and hiking, etc.).These earbuds surpassed my expectations in every way
Excellent, deep bass, and a much richer sound than the Bose Triports had
They are comfortable for earbuds, and I can wear them for a couple hours at a time at work before I need to take a break for a little bit

They also stay in your ears very well and do a great job of blocking outside sound


Comes with a nice little carrying case and 3 sizes of buds to fit different ears.Only one complaint, which others have commented on as well

The cable is only a couple feet long and comes with a separate extension cable
Where the cables meet is heavier than the rest of the cable and tends to swing around quite a bit during activities such as jogging or hiking

I just started to put it inside my shirt instead of outside and this resolved the issue
A minor complaint really, but worth mentioning.Overall, 5/5 stars, I use these now in situations where I'd normally haul a pair of full sized headphones, they really sound that good


Highly recommended for portable listening.


$SUMMARY.: Excellent choice for the money

$REVIEW.: I really wanted to get the ProCenter 2000 but space limitations forced me to go with the 1000.  With the reviews here, I was pretty sure I would be happy even with it.  But I guess that I was expecting more than is realistic to expect from a speaker this small.  Overall, it sounds very good.  No real complaints.  But I was expecting a WOW speaker, and this is merely a very good speaker.  And not super cheap either.The pros:  It is VERY clear on the vocals and sounds good.The cons:  It doesn't have as much PUNCH as I was expecting and not as much low-end as I was hoping for based on the specs.I would recommend it if space is a problem, but if you have the cash and the space, I'd get the 2000 model instead.
$SUMMARY.: Not quite as impressive as I was expecting from the reviews - but a good solid center speaker.

$REVIEW.: I have owned the Samsung BD-P1600 for 8 months


I had to return the first unit to the retailer because of malfunctions after a firmware upgrade

The new unit, even after the firmware upgrade, works much better
This unit plays DVD, Blue Ray, CD, and JPeg formats
Set-up was fairly easy and day to day operatons works well
A nice feature of this (and other new units) unit is the wireless internet connection for Netflix, YouTube, Blockbuster, and Pandora


After I bought a wireless plugin and set that up, moderate difficulty here, that is really a nice way to view movies


What I do not like about this player is the remote and some of the menu functions

The remote is practally useless

Tiny "play", "stop", and other buttons mixed in with many other buttons I'll never use make it difficult to use

The other minor complaint was that some of the menu's do not follow a logical order
Mainly, under the wireless setup, removing or "forgetting" a network is not  possible

The add network is not in the network setup menu.Overall it's an ok unit for me.

It is the same size as the keyboard on the Chromebook and I found it equally easy to type on. My only issue with it ts that the white letters on the keys can be difficult to read against the bright green background. If It had black letters, as it does on the function keys, on all the keys, it wouldn't look as cool, but I'd like it better.My main use for this keyboard is as a remote keyboard for the Chomebook when it is connected, by an HDMI cable, to a HD TV. With a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, I can close the Chromebook and stick it out of sight while using the TV as a big, high resolution display.

$review_text.: The Canon 10-22mm EF-S wide angle zoom or the 17-40mm EF "L" zoom?  I deliberated this decision for over a month, having physically tested both lenses on my 350D crop frame DSLR at local camera shops and spending a near ridiculous amount of time reading through indispensable online reviews such as this one.  With the price for each being roughly the same, the decision came down to the 10-22's ultra-wide capability vs. the 17-40's build quality.I ended up choosing the 17-40 and here's why:-Incredible optics and sharpness.  If you're like me and have never owned an "L" series lens before, you'll be able to see the difference in optical construction quality before you ever snap a digital shot.  It's evident in the viewfinder just how precise this lens is.-Longevity: I'm the kind of guy who likes high quality equipment and can see myself upgrading to a full-frame sensor camera body sooner rather than later.-Wide vs. Ultra-wide: You'll often read warnings of the difficulty in framing sub-20mm ultra-wide compositions.  It's a valid point.  Only certain scenarios lend themselves to 180 degree framing but most of the time you'll be challenged to keep all of the uninteresting junk out of the frame.  I was a little worried about 17-40mm's 27-54mm conversion when used on a crop frame.  Would it be wide enough?  Answer, yes.  27mm is plenty wide for most applications and with the crop factor, I get almost zero barrel distortion at the widest edges.  In my estimation, the 10-22 is more of an effect lens whereas the 17-40 is much more of an everyday multi-purpose working lens.In summary, if the focal length range of the 17-40 doesn't overlap too much over your current lens kit and you favor high-quality wide over good quality ultra-wide, then this lens is right for you.*NOTE: If the 17-40's inclusion of a lens hood is influencing your decision in anyway over the 10-22, don't let it be.  The hood is basically a pain in the rear due to it's ridiculous size and shape.  Difficult to pack and you'd probably be better served just picking up a 77mm protection filter.

$review_text.: I've spent quite some time researching this category of chargers as I use my phone a lot and find myself in the city with too little charge left and no convenient power source around.After reading countless reviews it became obvious that the Achilles heel of all these devices are their batteries. Regardless of brand/model you look at, there were always poor reviews of either insufficient battery capacity, insufficient current to charge latest generation devices, or batteries aging rather quickly. With most designs using integrated custom batteries, any battery issue requires a device replacement.There are a few models out there which rely on off-the-shelf AA batteries instead, which is a much more sensible design approach. Make the battery a separate part, so it can be easily and quickly replaced once it ages. And also additional batteries can be carried for extra charging capacity, and worst case there's the corner drugstore for some extra AA copper tops.I've settled on such a model, which has a 1A output, enough to charge an iPad, takes 4 AA batteries, and has a nice handy form factor. Sometimes keeping it simple is better.

$review_text.: The Kaito KA1102 (Degen DE1102 in Asia) is absolutely fantastic! It certainly lives up to all the positive things reviewers have said about it.It is as good as my 14 year old Panasonic RF-B45. The Kaito outshines the Panasonic with its 'wide' and 'narrow' bandwidth. The shortwave frequencies match the Panasonic for selectivity, although, perhaps, it's reception is a bit clearer. MW is a bit better overall. In Malaysia however the selection of MW stations is not as numerable as in the US; nevertheless, I was able to pull in a station in Vietnam that I could not get on my Panasonic, plus several Thai, Indonesian and Chinese stations. FM is more selective than the Panasonic as well. Bass and stereo reception may be heard with the earphones on FM.Some reviewers fault the ergonomics (i.e. paging system), but I find it no more confusing than some 3G cell phones. As for the push button volume control, well, again, it's like so many cell phones; you get used to it. I only find that it's not as loud as the Panasonic, but I suppose after-market speakers could remedy this. The blue backlight and rechargeable batteries are an asset too.The deciding factor for me over theKaito KA1103 Worldband Radio/Degen DE1103 was its continuous tuning (3.10-30.00 MHz). The KA1103/DE1103 tunes only international shortwave bands, i.e.  75 meters, 60 meters, 49 meters, 42 meters, 31 meters, 25 meters, 21 meters, 19 meters, 16 meters, 13 meters. With continuous tuning, the KA1102/DE1102 catches stations outside these meter bands.As for cons, it overloads when an external wire antenna is hooked to the whip aerial, but this may be because it is amplified.  When using an internal wire antenna of similar length plugged into the antenna jack there is no overload. With the Panasonic, it does not matter whether it is hooked to the whip or jack.The radio is about the size of a postcard. Reminds me of the old pocket transitor radios back in the 1960s. It will definitely be a keeper whenever I travel overseas.As for the price, it's definitely worth it. You get a lot of radio for the buck. I bought mine (Degen DE1102) from China and it was a lot cheaper than what you'll find elsewhere on the web. If you opt for this and you live in the US, you might consider getting a 110 volt power adaptor.My only hope now is that it gives me as many years of listening pleasure as the Panasonic RF-B45.POST-SCRIPT (30 March 2007)Six months on and this little dynamo is still functioning...and I have been pretty aggressive with it. From Malaysia, I have logged shortwave stations from Austria, Canada (CBC), Czech Republic (Radio Prague), Ethiopia,  Egypt, Turkey (Voice of Turkey), the Netherlands (Radio Nederland), South Africa (SABC) Sweden (Radio Sweden), North Korea (Radio Pyongyang) and South Korea (KBS), New Zealand (Radio New Zealand International), Iraq (Kurdish speaking station), Voice of Africa (Libya), Iran and Taiwan -- all rather difficult to receive at times. Of course, BBC, Voice of Russia, China Radio International, NHK, Deutsche Welle, Radio Australia, Radio Thailand, Radio Indonesia, Voice of Vietnam, Radio Singapore, All India Radio are flame throwers in this part of the world. The single greatest asset of this radio remains its wide/narrow filter; it does a superb job of reducing powerful stations next to weaker ones. This portable SW PPL radio is still No. 1 in my book!!!POST-SCRIPT (20 March 2008)This little dynamo is still active and pulling in stations all over the world. Still the best buy around!POST-SCRIPT (11 APRIL 2009)The radio is still functioning and pulling in amazing signals. Just a few weeks ago I logged Spanish National Radio, Madrid, Spain. Still one of the best portable shortwave radios in its class.POST-SCRIPT (19 FEBRUARY 2010)The radio is still working and pulling in some rather exotic stations in this part of the world (Malaysia). In the past few weeks I have logged the Voice of Mongolia, Radio Bulgaria, Radio Tirana (Albania), Radio DMR Pridnestrovye (Moldova), Radio Romania International and Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. Everything is functioning, even the batteries still hold a good charge for hours. It remains an excellent buy for anyone interested in the hobby of short-wave listening.

$review_text.: The matte black one looks nice when the Apple logo lights up

You can expect some wear on this but it will serve it's purpose
Using on the 15" Retina.At first I had this at 5 stars, but cutting that to 4 or maybe 3.5

The bottom right side pops loose all the time and I have to re-snap it

It could use an extra clip spot on each side to secure it better
It's okay but a minor nuisance
Not sure if this is typical or the fit of this one is just a little off
Also a fingerprint magnet but you expect that with a matte finish.

$SUMMARY.: (Edited for minor fit issue) Pretty good, go with the "Matte Black" variety.

$review_text.: This is a great mount for the price


I moved and left my old mount behind, but it is this exact same design and construction so I bought it again

It holds my 55&#34; TV, 66 pounds with ease
 I love the ability to pull such a huge TV away from the wall and angle it more than 45 degrees to watch from adjacent rooms


I never worry that my TV will fall or shift unexpectedly


My only dislike is that when fully retracted,  the back of my TV is still 6&#34; from the wall.

$REVIEW.: After my neighbor showed me his ROKU, I had to have my own.  After I showed it to 4 people, they had to have their own ROKUs. Because ROKU allows access to so many live streaming channels (instead of just a few, as offered when using a blu-ray player to live stresm, it is the best invention to advance TV enjoyment since TV became popular. I also recommend that ROKU owners become AMAZON PRIMEmembers and  to take full advantage of being a member, such as free access to AMAZON PRIME movies and 2 day shipping of products sold by AMAZON.

 But for the money it does quite a bit pretty darn well

 It is a fun device


 A great value IMO

 I use it daily to play music from Pandora and to stream pics from Picasa

 Also lets me stay up to date on stock market and headline news, and offers quite a few other cool apps

 Kind of lame for games - I would definitely not recommend it to someone who planned to use it that way

 I was very tempted to give this a 5 star rating, but it just does not quite have the quality and consistency of performance to warrant that.

This is a much better product, it's cheaper and has a longer range and it has a battery saving feature so I can leave the dongle plugged in, plus the USB dongle is very small compared to the Microsoft USB antenna and has no annoying LED on it to beam on my eyes while I sleep since my laptop is by my bed. 5 stars, highly recommended! Works great and shipping was fast from China, it's amazing that it's so cheap but it's the real deal.

$review_text.: The software installed easily on my(older) Dell Dimension Pentium 3GHz dual processor machine running Windows XP with 2GB RAM and NVIDIA GeForce 9500 GT video card.  The video enhancer is pretty cool and was able to make an old low definition digital video look a lot better.  It even shows you side-by-side real time comparison and allows you to select the amount of enhancement from 0 to 100. The smart stretch feature works okay, but still left distortion.It plays video files well that are 720p and 1080p.  However, my machine struggled with the 1080p files if I tried jumping to a different part of the movie.  It locked up and created an error report for Microsoft.  Then it wouldn't start again until the computer was rebooted.  So the performance was just OK on my older machine.Unfortunately, I don't have a Blu-ray device, so I couldn't test that portion of the software.  Also, 3D glasses are included but the 3D features only run on Windows 7.May be a great product for a newer computer.

$REVIEW.: This does exactly what it is supposed to do, so I'll give it five stars. I had some confusion however when I purchased this item. I initially bought the Kindle ($69) as a gift and it says the power adapter is not included. I took this to mean that if I didn't also purchase this that the person would have no way to charge their new Kindle. I was even more confused when I received the item and there was no USB to Kindle cord. It was then that I realized that the Kindle does come with the cord, but just the cord. So the person is able to hook the Kindle up to a computer. If you want to be able to plug it into the wall, that is what this is for and it is just the plug end that is pictured here.Others have said and I do agree that you could probably get a cheaper version of this, or you may already have one with all the devices these days that use USB to charge (ipod, iphone etc). However, giving it as a gift I thought it looked nice to have the official charger to go with it, buying at the same time as Kindle I got this for $9.99.

$review_text.: This little radio is fairly easy to setup and when it works it's pretty slick. The sound is fine for a device this size and it has the look and feel of a well built radio - much better quality than most electronics you see in the big box stores today. The number of stations available is almost too much - although if you're like me after much experimentation you'll probably find your favourites and stick mostly to them.The problem is - the radio is very buggy. Buggy to the point that since the last firmware update (7.5) mine just stops working on a regular and consistent basis. Sometimes hitting the play button will cause it to start again, sometimes you have to change stations then change back to the one you want to listen to to get it to start playing again, sometimes you have to reboot the radio to get it to come back on. This is the case every time I use it.I would say when they get the bugs worked out this will be a great Internet radio - but at this point in time you should definitely think twice about purchasing this device.[UPDATE] - 5.26.2010 - It would seem Logitech has made some changes which resolved the issue I had with the radio stopping on a regular basis. For the past week or so I can turn it on, select a station, and it will play until I turn it off. Fantastic! I've changed my review to 4 stars accordingly.

$REVIEW.: Good drive.I needed to update my Toshiba laptop's hard drive, a 2009 Seagate 500Gb model which was exhibiting a well-known click/beep/freeze, and for which Seagate has STILL not released a firmware correction


Okay, that's a bit off-topic, but I am switching to a WD drive because I no longer trust Seagate for laptop OR desktop drives.First, I used this drive in an external enclosure to make a disk clone with Acronis TrueImage; no problems there


Then, this drive fit the laptop hard drive bay perfectly, and was immediately identified by the laptop's BIOS

Windows booted up on the first try and I'm back up and running

It's much quieter than the older drive; I can hardly hear it spinning and the head seek noise is almost imperceptible


It's quieter than the laptop cooling fan
The only easily audible noise is the startup disk spin-up and the head-unlock click.Naturally I cannot yet comment on this drive's reliability, but my previous WD desktop drive purchases have done very well.

$review_text.: I like the review that says "it works in the summer."  Except it does not RELIABLY work in the summer, e.g., when the weather is cool or when you have the air conditioner on.  Which basically means it cannot be depended on to do the one thing you buy it for-- hold your gps on the dash.  It just does not stay put.  And I've tried it with different gps units and a number of different dashes.  It somewhat work on uneven dashes where you can sort of lodge it in place.  But that was on a rental SUV, so it is of overall very limited use. And, therefore, not worth purchasing.

The USB 3.0 is so much faster than 2.0, and makes getting this worth while (I'm not sure why some are still made with 2.0)

 This really should suit just about any build

It is a much better product in this, and all the other aspects, than my old Toshiba. Windows 8.1 doesn't bother me - I have it set to boot up to the desktop. I enjoy the fact that it boots up faster than 7 used to.The only &#34;con&#34; I have found, which is becoming less of one as I get used to it, is the touchpad. Not having the discrete buttons has required me to change the way I use it, and it's hard to teach old dogs new tricks.I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone wanting to continue to work on the go.

$review_text.: First off, to be fair, I typically deal with higher end products --- I got this one for my home connection because I didnt want to pay the premium for an enterprise unit but needed some of the functionality.What I needed:- A good wireless router for home use- The ability to run IPSEC VPN Tunnels between my home and multiple work sites- The ability to run my VOIP telephone over 2 of those IPSEC VPN Tunnels- I am currently running 3 VPN tunnels 24x7, had no issues, including SIP VOIP Phone traffic on those tunnels (ONE Phone in my home office)PROs:- Unit feels solid, well built.- Unit is EASY to configure (as long as you have some idea what you are trying to do)- IPSEC VPN Tunnels do work - Successful links with Cisco ASA and Sonicwall endpoints at this time- Works with Dynamic DNS Providers which is needed in most cases if you want VPN tunnels setup on a home connection.- The unit itself has not had to be rebooted (so no actual unit stability issues) --- VPN tunnels stay up and are solid.- This is a SPI Firewall (I think a majority are now days)CONs:- I have had issues with the wireless, one of my laptops and my XBox 360 both drop offline on occasion, I have to reset the Wifi card on my laptop and completely reboot the X-Box when this happens

 I ran a firmware update and it helped, although it has not completely fixed the issue --- My Linksys wireless router is much more reliable for this use


 ** THIS ONE ISSUE COSTS 1 STAR **- It has a dual band radio, however you can only use one band or the other, both bands can not be active at the same time! ** THIS ONE ISSUE COSTS ONE STAR **- With easy to configure VPN tunnels comes limitations, don't expect "network list" type functionality
--- Again, get what you pay for --- Not a big deal 99% of the time in the environments that it was designed for.General Info:- We have the ability to get blazing fast internet where I am (up to 100MB down) --- Don't expect this router to handle those speeds
(they also do not advertise it to handle those speeds)

 Advertised speeds for this router are 60Mb/sec LAN-WAN (standard internet) and 20Mb/sec VPN interfaces

 Keep in mind that speeds are only half of the story, depending on the traffic types in use
Those speeds are likely "optimal condition" and will not be sustained with high-packet applications (Voice)

 I have not been able to find any data on how many pps (packets per second) are supported by this router, you will find this information publicly published with higher end devices and this could be a factor in how well things work depending on how many users / devices are on the network, again a much bigger concern if you are using something like Hosted Voice over IP phone systems and have multiple endpoints on the phone at any one time.- This unit supports 5 "Site to Site" IPSec VPN Tunnels- I have NOT used the SSL VPN function, have it disabled, and can not comment on its performance.Overall:- If you are at a business location, spend the money to get a better device, spend the money now to get something that will grow with your business taking into account any future expansions, whether or not you plan to securely connect to people working from home, and any other plans that you might have
My prefered devices for actual business sites are the Cisco ASA series, Juniper SRX series, and SonicWall devices


 Many of these can be had for under $1000 and will last years


It never hurts to ask your IT professional what their recommendations are as well!- If you have a need for business connectivity at home, this will do the job very well
 I would have NO problems recommending this product for workers who telecomute into their office from home
 This device will allow you to setup a secure tunnel with your office environment and works very well for this use!- I deducted 2 stars due to limitations and issues with wireless.

$REVIEW.: I've had this headset for a couple weeks, and bought it to replace some more expensive headsets that I've lost over the years.The good:-Pairing with the iPhone is dead simple.-Siri works perfectly fine with the headset - click the multifunction button and Siri is there to service you.-Sound quality is good-Inexpensive...

so losing it won't make me angry.-Supports music playbackThe not good:-Powering on, the headset likes to "talk out" the current state of the headset - wasting time and interrupting the phone conversation-Battery charge of this device is not displayed on the handset.-Ear fit, for me, is poor.I'm keeping it, but it is definitely my "backup" headset
 If I were to buy another headset tomorrow, I wouldn't buy this one.---UPDATE: I did lose it, and I don't feel too bad about it since it was inexpensive and I didn't care for it all that much


 Look for my review of my next purchase soon.

$REVIEW.: The player works well with a few things I find annoying.  The picture quality is always going to be dependent on multiple variables (Television, Cables, etc.) but I find it to be very impressive on my current configuration.  As it seems with all newer video players whether it is a blu-ray or DVD burner, it takes awhile to load.  The player also does not seem to keep your place on the DVD about 65% of the blu-ray discs when the movie is stopped and restarted.  I am not sure if this is due to the creation of the particular blu-ray or a limitation of the hardware.  I do like the fact you can hook up to the internet for firmware (software) updates to keep features current.  It is a nice player and can be found on Amazon much cheaper than in the stores.  I would recommend it to a friend.
$SUMMARY.: Sony BDP-S350 Great picture but slow to load

$REVIEW.: My son, a software engineer, recently had the opportunity to try out the Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T. I'm writing this review based on notes that I took over the weekend regarding his brief encounter with this new Windows 8 based hybrid tablet computer. Before reviewing the computer, I would like to point out a few of the comments that he made regarding the Windows 8 platform. In his opinion; the highly anticipated Windows 8 was superb, but be prepared to spend a little time learning the new OS. Once learned, it's a very simple and well thought out design. There are many hidden controls on Windows 8, which in his opinion is a good thing as it saves precious real estate. No doubt, Microsoft had this in mind when they designed their new OS. You simply move the cursor to the corner of the screen to find the out of sight controls. He found this to be very easy to learn and after a few minutes of use, highly intuitive. As a big Apple fan and iPad enthusiast, he was more than impressed with the Windows 8 OS. While requiring a little more learning time, it compares very favorably with OS X from Apple. As for the Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T; he absolutely loved it. The device comes with an impressive 11.6-in. touch LED that quickly attaches to a keyboard base. You simply push a button at the top of the keyboard to release the display screen. The HD screen is very impressive, and provides the capability for 1920 x 1080 resolution. The hybrid laptop/tablet computer weighs in at less than 2 pounds and comes with Intel's Core i5-3317U chip. It includes 4GB RAM and a 128GB SSD. Since the keyboard detaches from the main display in less than a second; this is a true hybrid device and in his opinion, the future of computing. This is a legitimate, fully functional laptop computer, and a fully functional tablet computer, similar to the iPad. In the full function keyboard mode, the device operates no differently than a regular laptop or desktop PC. The keyboard touch-pad is a breeze to use. With the keyboard detached, you have a fabulous tablet capable of performing virtually any task imaginable. Samsung thought of everything on this device, including a 2-megapixel HD front webcam and 8-megapixel HD back webcam. The 8-megapixel rear webcam allows for superb images and is a major step above the iPad. The built-in stereo speakers are quite impressive for a device of this size. There's also a headphone jack for external speakers or private listening. It comes with a wireless N connectivity, with ability to connect to older networks as well. It also sports a Micro HDMI, a USB 3.0 port and Micro SD slot. The tablet can be used with your fingers or with the S pen that comes with it. The bottom line is that this is a high-end, fully functional laptop/desktop/tablet computer, capable of doing just about anything, just about anywhere.Pros: Fully functional laptop or tablet computerSuperb Windows 8 OSKeyboard, touch-pad, or S Pen operationMagnificent high resolution HD screenLong lasting batterySuper fast Intel Core i5 processorMuch more functionality than iPad3G or 4G LTE compatibleReasonably priced for what you getCons: Slightly heavier than an iPad (Insignificant, especially when used without keyboard)Slightly longer learning curve than iPad (Insignificant)Final thoughts: This device is the future of computing. While the iPad is a revolutionary tablet; this device goes beyond the capabilities of the iPad and is an overall better computing system. There is virtually nothing that can't be done with this incredible new offering from Samsung and Microsoft. Apple will have a run for its money with the introduction of this amazing new hybrid laptop/notebook computer. One last note: I own the new 3rd generation iPad which I consider to be an excellent device. In my opinion; it has always been the standard to which others are trying to catch up to. From what my son has told me, the Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T is capable of doing so much more than an iPad, that I may consider purchasing one. I honestly believe that the domination of the iPad in the tablet market will come to an end, as more and more hybrid devices such as this Samsung come on the market. Apple may actually have to play catch-up for a change.

$REVIEW.: Purchased from Amazon.  White glove delivery was seamless.  They unpacked the set, attached the swivel stand, placed it on the media console and hooked it up to the cablebox.  All I had to do was supervise.  Now let's talk about the 55LD650 itself.Picture Quality.  Considering there are no reviews out yet, I considered it somewhat of a gamble to purchase this new LG model (which according to the sticker was built in February of this year).  But after watching HD programing for a few hours, my concerns evaporated.  The picture quality is impressive. This is my first LCD.  I've always been a plasma guy and have two Pannys, so I had my concerns.  Howver, after watching Monsters vs Aliens, I definitely have no complaints about the PQ.  The images on the 55 inch screen popped beautifully.  So much so that my kids even asked if it was in 3D!Off-Angle Viewing.  Viewing the TV from various angles (even extreme ones), I can confirm that this set did not have any noticeable degradation in picture quality from off-angle viewing(unlike some Sonys I looked at).  Very impressive.Glare.  This was the main reason I sought out an LCD set, since the TV resides in a very bright room with two sides of floor-to-ceiling windows.  This eliminated the plasma option (though we first tried a Sammy plasma and aside from the mirror-like glare, we couldn't handle the loud buzzing noise it made).  While there's some glare on this TV when it's not on, there was nothing noticeable on the matte sceen when watching programs.All in all, I'm very pleased with 55ld650 thus far.

$review_text.: Overall, I like it.I played two songs as a test:http://www.amazon.com/Misery-Original-Mix/dp/B003UQZL82/ref=sr_1_30?ie=UTF8&s;=dmusic&qid;=1327623665&sr;=1-30andhttp://www.amazon.com/Nite-Original-Mix/dp/B002P95JB4/ref=sr_1_23?ie=UTF8&s;=dmusic&qid;=1327623665&sr;=1-23Both songs helped me confirmed these conclusions:Pros:Decent bass. Granted, it isn't as good as my cars' stereos (I have factory, basic stereos on my Toyota Camry 2000 and my Nissan Sentra SR special edition 2012). However, it produces enough bass that I actually can "feel" the thump.Portability. I love how portable this thing is! You unfold it to let it stand on the table or the floor, and fold it up to take it with you. The pictures are quite accurate. Unlike what some reviewers say, I feel it is quite sturdy. It's pretty heavy.It comes with an aux jack, which is what I used. I tested it with my computer. I can only assume that on an ipod, the sound quality should be even better since it's a direct connection.Power button. My other portable speaker doesn't have one. I hate that. I found that I had to disconnect the power and it drives me nuts.Overall, the sound quality is quite balanced.Cons:It can use more clarity in its sound. I can't hear the "little details" as much, but overall it gives a smooth feel.Not very loud. It's probably okay in a small room, but it's definitely not good enough at a larger, noisier party.It squeaks at certain high notes. My computer speaker does not do that. However, I do have it turned on to the highest (though I don't at all feel that it's LOUD).Well, I like it. I'm not sure I would ever buy one if I don't already have it, but I think it would be great for someone who needs to travel on business trips and give presentations. This would be a good addition to the portal projector packages in a meeting.Personally, I'm going to put it in my classroom - the computer speakers that come from my schools are terrible.

$REVIEW.: (Updated Oct 7th for available cases see at end)All of the other reviews are spot on: the best tablet currently available.(but remove the stupid clear screen protector that is pre-installed and useless -it will not remove Sony logo(is a myth), just remove it slowly as you would with any ptotector on a large screen. Trust me, it will significantly improve clarity,glare and reduce smudges. No other vendor I know does this with such a screen.Put your own protector on if you must, but remove the pre-installed one since it will get marked and scratched eventually and you may forget that it exists in the first place. I missed it was even there until I read about it. Made a world of difference when i removed. I NEVER use a screen protector for any Gorilla Glass type display-waste of money when loss of clarity is weighed against glare reduction. Gorilla type glass is its own protection, hence the name Gorilla...)So why repeat what others have said? I want to draw your attention to another benefit, for those of us(in my case middle aged)who have to keep increasing fonts due to our vision. Well the Xperia Tablet with the Sony screen clarity and portrait friendly aspect, cannot be beaten by ANY tablet, even the Ipad retina 4.A bold statement some would say...the less charitable however would say its damned foolish...or even inaccurate. Why? Because it has a lower screen resolution than the ipad or Nexus 10? True. But better specs do not necessarily mean clearer visibility. The hardware and software of the tablet has to support the screen resolution. Just because the tablet is capable of that screen resolution, does not mean that it actually achieves it. Don't get me wrong...both the Nexus 10 and Ipad retina have brilliant screen resolution, but the Xperia, to me anyway, is just as good to my naked aging eye. But 'just as good ' is not better. Sony's screen technology and software makes the difference in clarity. I find that with the ipad 4 the text doesn't look right . I would probably much prefer the retina display on the forthcoming ipad mini actually. I think the retina type displays on larger devices make the type look too bold somehow-that is the best i can describe it.There is a big difference between clear text that is easy on the eye and text that is just too crisp. Sony has the best screen technology ever-it is what they are the best at,IMHO. Their use of contrast,saturation and light, makes all the difference.But, and there is a but, i did not feel that way about  18 months ago and loved the Retina 4(though not the limited Apple Ecosystem, lack of widgets,customization etc): so vision has a major part to play in this.Just something I wanted you to know, especially if you are in your forties and want the best tablet to use for the next few years. This is it.October 7th: I have been using the PDAIR custom Leather sleeve and it is so form fitting that it makes the tablet look even smaller, I swear!It also makes it look even classier if that is possible. Hefty $99.00 price tag though-includes shipping from Hong Kong from PDAIR directly. Worth it to me since the protection is great while taking up little extra space in my man bag :)Sept 16th:I know so many of you do not know how to find a case or a sleeve that does not mess up the awesomeness of this slim light tablet. i found the perfect solution:91)Incipio Feather Case for the Sony Xperia Z Tablet - Obsidian Black (SE-201),which will still allow the Sony to fit inside the:Alchemy Goods Redmond Tablet Sleeve for New iPad and iPad2The sleeve is gorgeous(see my review for that) and has a leathery look to it, classy yet practical,with great protection. The incipio adds zero bulk and no discernible weight.Trust me on this. I purchased and returned 5 cases to provide this solution. Remember that the Xperia is a pretty tough tablet as well. Like this review if it helps you please!!!GMYLE (TM) Black PU leather Laichee Pattern Sleeve Case Bag Cover with extra pocket for Microsoft Surface RT / Samsung Galaxy Tablet Tab Note 10.1 N8000 N8010 N8013 / iPad / Nexus 10 / Asus TF300 TF700 10 10.1 inchSlimmer sleeve-looks just like leather-little bulk.

$review_text.: Hi Guys,I bought and used this product for 4 months so I'm giving you the reviewPROS- nice quality of component, not much plastic details


Solid unit

Heavy (especially with loaded disks)- support up to 4 disks (so you could 8 GB JBOD array for a very low price)- various RAID support (I'm using JBOD) including 10 and 5 (never tried 5 though)- very easy setup- works as DLNA Server, so I'm able to see pics and movies from this device right on my PS3 and TV- very quiet- goes offline when not used and wake up on connect through networkCONS- if you put it on corner in front, the face panel will drop off (so when I'm checking cables at the back, i'm pulling back up and front pannel shifts and then drops)- I put thousands of pictures on this device and family movies- almost 80% of the moves are disappeared on my PS3 (however I'm getting them listed on my computer and can watch them)

Not sure if that's PS3 issue or NAS issue (but before I got many pics all movies were playable through PS3, so I'm assuming it's NAS issue)- VERY VERY often when I'm watching pics on my TV through NAS DLNA I'm getting DLNA Error message and then have to restart my NAS
This is the most annoying disadvantage

ON PC it works - perfectly - no problems

But direct DLNA doesn't work that well


Probably a cpu and memory limitation of NAS device

It's all fine if I setup DLNA Server on my windows laptop and then watch the same pics & movies on my PS3 but through PC DLNA that uses shared NAS as a storage- you can't connect by SSH2 to tune/see settings- not super intuitive admin web interface, however it works.- no way to see in LCD panel that you've got problems with the disk.I'm very happy with this "home"-NAS on my PC, but usage through TV or PS3 could be better.Thanks,Dmitry

$review_text.: I have purchased this style case for 3 tablets (Galaxy Tab 7 2, Nexus 7, Nexus 7 2013). I keep getting it because the case style is durable and precisely what I want in a tablet case. For me one of the most important features is that the case is designed in a way to allow me to pull the tablet out of the case without having to unvelcro or unsnap anything and the friction grips do not ware out or damage the tablet.I have not given this a 5 star because the magnet in the case is over powered just as it originally was in the previous Nexus 7 case. In order to prevent the tablet from going into screen sleep I have had to cut the activation magnet out from the inside under the hand grip band.I don't know why Poetic didn't use the magnets from the case reissue the sent me to replace the original Nexus 7 case when the flaw was discovered.Regardless of that, if you are willing to make a little slit in the lining under the hand strap this is a solid well made accessory. Even though it has this flaw I recommend this case for N7 owners I know as well as owners of other tables Poetic makes this case for.Edit:This is one of the reasons I keep going back to this manufacturer."Dear Poetic Customers,We would like to first of all thank all of our perspective customers, because without your patronage, we would not have survived as long as we have today, and we intend to succeed and grow with our cutting edge products.We will be shipping an updated model  to every customer who have purchased the "StrapBack Case For Google Nexus 7 2nd Generation" in Black due to a flaw in the magnets that activate the sleep and waking feature.

We believe that you are eagerly waiting for these replacements to appear on your doorstep, as we are also eager to hear about your experiences with our products. Our success story is dependent upon customer support and commentary regarding our products. We are definitely listening to feedback from every nook and cranny when creating this update. Google's 7 inch Nexus tablet, now in its second generation, is known to be a great tablet, and we want to make our StrapBack case great for the Nexus 7 2nd Generation great as well."You can COUNT on Poetic!

$review_text.: I saw the overall rating for this product was 4 1/2 stars so I was not too hesitant about buying 2 of them. Read some of the reviews which said that the older model which had the slot for speaker in the back caused the tablet to go into sleep mode when folded back but that this had been fixed in the new model.The two cases I received had holes in the back, not the slot so it looks like the new model based on some of the customer posted pics and comments. However, when the case was fully opened and flipped back it put my device into sleep mode and it could not be unlocked without it going to sleep right away.I also didn't like it when I had the device on my lap in the front slant position. It kept slipping out of the slot and falling flat when I moved a little. Found myself having to keep my thumb on the corner of it when in use to keep it in place. Worked fine in the back slot.The short is I returned both of them. This just isn't what I expected even if I had the "supposed" new model with the sleep function fix.Update: The vendor has contacted me and sent me 2 new covers. These do work and I am able to unlock the device while it is folded over.  However, I still don't care for it because the tablet slips out of position easily when standing up. This vendor deserves 5 stars for reacting quickly to customer comment and sending replacement merchandise which does work. I would buy from this vendor again.

The front and back plastic covers snap together to create a single piece, but I'm wondering how many drops/bumps, or how much time before those little clips break, or get loose.  Otherwise, it's a nice case.There is one major problem:In the description of the item, it says "built in screen protector".  This is false advertising.  The screen protector is NOT built in to the case.  I was really, really, really excited about not having to apply a screen protector film.  I assumed that the screen protector would be actually attached to the case in some way.  Instead, I received...  you guessed it...  a screen-sized piece of clear film.  It also came with a cute little credit-card "screen applicator".So...Pro's:Case seems sturdyGood designButton covers workCon's:No built in screen protectorNot 100% sure about the plastic clips holding the case together, but only time will tell.

$REVIEW.: The only reason its not 5 stars is that I find when I prop it up using the front cover it does not always stay and I just lean it up against something

The folded cover needs some sort of material that will not slide.Love the cover


It is everything they said other than the leaning thing and that is not that big a deal.It is solid and it fits the tablet well


The on/off works with the cover, but its really not off


it's asleep

The batter lasts longer if you turn it off, but that is not a cover issue.I would recommend this
Samsung lost out by not having their cover available when the tablet was released.

$REVIEW.: This thing is a complete fraud! If you are one of the fools that this thing has tricked then you didn't truly have a weak signal problem to begin with. That or your a tech moron.So here's the gimmick. It merely clones your network. It makes a seperate wi-fi signal in your house but it is not by any stetch of the imagination stronger. Clones your wi-fi and repeats it but DOES NOT boost it. At all. I have needed a wifi extender in my home for quite some time so I am extremely familiar with what all my devices can do on my network and where they can do them and this worthless piece 'o plastic did nothing to help. I returned it 3 days after buying and I suggest you don't waste your time on this thing. I would say opt for a more expensive one but guess what? Even the much pricier ones have terrible reviews! My next step will to be replace my router and/or dump U-verse...

$REVIEW.: While I can't say that I purchased my 709B here at Amazon (they didn't carry it at the time), I wanted to chime in for anyone considering this pocket tripod. To sum it up in one word: "quality". While I have a much larger Manfrotto tripod, this little one gets the most use. Easy to throw in a camera bag, great to take traveling, built like a tank, and even supports lightweight dSLRs in a pinch if needed, such as the Nikon D3100 et al.

The overall sound and features of a pair of these Play 360's is better than the Bose, making them the best out there.  The 360's almost match the Bose in sound quality, volume, portability and weight.  Where the Nokia's bests Bose is in price, replacable batteries and most importantly with the speaker separation, the stereo effect is better than any other bluetooth/portable speakers out there.---------------Sep. 12, 2013 update.

$review_text.: The hardware itself works as expected
 Haven't used it long enough to comment on the reliability though.Speed, what speed?  When you buy a SSD, the least you should be concerned of is the speed

 It is unfortunate that so many people are obsessed on reading specs which simply do not matter in real life.When it comes to SSD, all that matters is the reliability, because even the slowest SSD are fast enough, to a point that anything faster would be virtually unnoticeable in daily routine use.Reliability is an entirely different matter

 In contrast to the speed, there are many unreliable SSDs out there

When they have problems, they tend to be very costly problems.Therefore, approach SSDs with a practical mind
 It is not a gadget you can game with


Buy the most reliable, and forget about the specs.I chose to stick with Intel, both because of their track record, and because of my personal experience
 I bought this SSD to replace a three-year-old Intel 320 SSD, which has had absolutely no problems on a system that is almost never shut down 24/7 in the last three years
 I decided to replace it because I've run out of space on it.SOFTWARE PROBLEM:But I would like to alert users that the Intel data migration software is not a reliable tool

 It is very easy to use, and works mostly, but fails to do a complete clone migration
 I run into a problem, which is seemingly minor but time-consuming to fix
The QuickBooks Pro 2012 failed to recognize the license and therefore could not be run on the new drive after migration.I believe this problem with QuickBooks is not isolated


These programs probably are designed to defeat users transferring the program from one system to another

To prevent this, only an exact clone of the disk would work.I ended up erasing everything, and using the Windows 7 Restore to do the migration again
 This method was far more difficult, and would need some fairly high level computer knowledge, but it did fix the problem of the QuickBooks Pro license problem.Here is how you do a restore on your Windows 7 (you need a backup hard drive in order to do this):(1) While you are still using your current system and current hard drive, go to Control Panel, and click on "Backup and Restore".(2) On the left side panel, click "create a system image", and follow the instructions to create a system image on your backup drive.(3) On the left side panel, click "create a system repair disc", and follow the instructions to create a system repair disc, if you don't already have one.(4)  Make sure that your computer is set to boot from a CD drive..(5)  Turn off your computer and connect your new SSD hard drive to your system

 You may need to replace the old hard drive, but on some desktop computers, if you have enough power connectors and SATA connectors and cables, you may not need to take off the old hard drive
So it depends, but regardless, you will need your new SSD hard drive to be installed at this point.(6)  Place the system repair disc in a CD drive, and reboot your computer from the system repair disc.(7)  Choose in the system repair menu "repair using an existing image" (or something like that, I don't quite remember the exact phrase).(8)  Select the backup drive on which you saved the system image as the source drive.(9)  Select the new SSD hard drive as the target hard drive on which the system is going to be "restored to".(10) Follow the instructions to complete the process of restore

 It may take up to 30 min

depending on the size of your drive.I know this is quite complicated, but this is a far more reliable method to ensure that you really are getting an exact clone of your hard drive

If you have some programs like QuickBooks on your system, this is how you get it work

 The Intel data migration software failed on this important details although it does seem to work mostly.However, strangely enough, even with the windows system restore based on an image, Microsoft office document cache is messed up on the new drive after the restore

 The regular functions of the Office work just fine, but office document cache does not
 I had to manually fix it

 It is not a very serious problem, though

 You can probably ignore it and continue to use the Office because it will gradually build a new cache and leave the old one behind
 But it was annoying enough that I felt it had to be fixed.Had it not been these problems, upgrading to this SSD would take less than an hour total, and it would be fun to do


But it was no fun to go about these nasty problems.To the end, all worked fine, but given the time that I had to spend on this to fix those problems, I wish I didn't have to make this upgrade.

$SUMMARY.: Hardware is fine, but Intel data migration software has problems

$REVIEW.: The Bolse Wireless-N Mini Router is amazingly tiny and simple
 It is 1 7/8 in

x 2 7/8 in


x 2 1/4 in

deep, including the prongs


 It has 2 ethernet ports on the bottom (1 LAN & 1 WAN LAN), a hole to access the reset button with a paper clip on the side, and on the front, a WPS on/off button along plus yellow-green LED indicators for LAN, WAN, WPS, WLAN, and power

 That's it

 The design is very minimal and attractive and the quality of manufacture is excellent.The Mini Router can function as a primary router, repeater, access point, bridge, or client


 It is so easy to set up:1
 Plug the Mini Router into a power supply.2


 Connect the included 40 in
(1 m) ethernet cable to the correct port on the Mini Router and then to either the computer, router, or modem, depending on the intended use.3

 Connect to the wireless network.4


 Access the Mini Router software through the IP address and run the wizard for the intended use, although the default settings work fine without even looking at the software

 I did set the time and date for automatic updates (just had to click one button to pick up the computer's settings) and changed the password but didn't adjust anything else and even left the speed on the "auto" setting.The software has a simple menu with all the basics and is much easier to use than most router software I have tested.The instruction manual is really not necessary after accessing the software and, for that matter, the default IP address, user name, and password are printed on the label on the back of the Mini Router so there is really no need for the manual at all for someone who knows how to set up a router


 To my relief, nothing tricky has come up, except that if there is updated firmware available, I couldn't figure out exactly where to go to get it
 Software updates for these devices are rare, anyhow.I tested the speed using a Samsung Chromebook because that is the only device I use to wirelessly access my home network on a regular basis
 My nominal internet speed is 25 Mbps down and 2 Mbps up and it usually is something over 20 Mbps down and slightly over 2 Mbps up in practice


 I used the Internet Speed Test website to compare this router against my usual wireless network that  relies on a Buffalo AirStation router and a Linksys cable modem


 The wireless access to the WAN is always a few Mbps slower than wired access and it will vary by a few Mbps on successive tests but there was no difference in wireless speed between the Bolse Mini Router and the Buffalo AirStation router.This little device may not suffice as a primary router for most people because it lacks multiple ethernet ports to connect different devices to it but for wireless access on-the-go such as in a hotel or where space and network needs are basic and wireless such as in a dorm room, this would be ideal


 It would be even more mobile if the power prongs either folded back or had a cover to protect them but it is likely to go in a bag with other cables, a USB wall charger, etc., anyway.Overall, the Bolse Wireless-N Mini Router is a very good quality and surprisingly tiny and versatile wireless networking device and I am very impressed by it.A sample was provided for testing and unbiased review.

$review_text.: I purchased two of these shelves in preparation for a project


I have mounted one so far, not sure if I will end up needing the second (but good to have just in case).For those who don't read all the way through reviews, let me start with the one key piece of info: the 21 1/2" measurement is the distance it will protrude from your wall

In my case, I would have prefered it be less extended but I can deal with it

If you have space (extension from the wall) issues, make some careful measurements.The shelf is very nicely made

It is sturdy as heck, and mounts with some seriously large lag bolts! You want to stud mount this shelf however - don't try using wall anchors! The weight of the shelf alone would make that dangerous.I installed mine in about 30 minutes by myself
If you're handy with tools and have a drill, stud finder, socket set, and screwdriver - you're all set.The reason I witheld on star on my rating was because of two things:1) There is about 3-4 inches of wasted "air space" behind the glass shelf before you get to the wall


I would have preferred this be tighter to the wall, but that might not bother anyone but me.2) The shelf swivels, and I don't see any way to prevent it from doing so
So it is possible for the shelf to be bumped and for it to swivel side to side (and bump your wall)
You can stiffen it up, but you can't lock it in position.I like mine and would recommend it.

$SUMMARY.: Good high tech, "clean" looking component shelf

$review_text.: I've built 2 of the 3 desktop computers in our house, plus ourWindows Home Server.  In all the computers I've used Hitatchi drives and I haven't had a single failure.  This particular drive I have installed in my desktop and our Windows Home Server.The home server runs around the clock. It backs up our 3 desktop computers and 2 laptop computers nightly as well as holding our network shared folders.  The server was originally built with two 1 TB Hitachi drives 18 months ago, and 6 months ago I added this drive.  They've all been rock solid with no issues whatsoever.  The 2TB drive doesn't run too much hotter than the 1TB drives - I've uploaded a screen shot from my server's console to show the temperatures.I also used this drive when I refreshed my desktop computer - one I use for photo and video editing.  I replaced a RAID 0 array and separate data disk with an SSD OS/application disk (Crucial C300), using this drive for data storage.  Of course the computer boots much quicker and applications start instantly, but data access is much faster too.  This drive is fast.It's also quiet - I've read complaints that it's noisy but I haven't noticed any excessive noise.Installation was easy - just plugged it into my Windows 7 machine, waited for the computer to configure itself, and it was ready to go.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this drive.  Just don't forget to pick up a SATA cable like I did.  Fortunately I was able to use one from my former RAID array.

$REVIEW.: This is my first mITX build. Definitely much more tricky than a full-size build though it could have been much worse.This is a great case for an ITX build. Small enough to take advantage of the space advantages ITX offers, but large enough to fit a powerful graphics card. Having done it, I don't see a need to go for something bigger unless you want to do surround gaming (which usually requires 2 graphics cards).Pros:1. Smallest graphics card supporting ITX case I could find.2. Generally a pleasure to work with, as much pleasure as you can get doing an ITX build.3. Fits graphics cards up to 10". I have an EVGA GTX 670 card in there. Of course it wasn't very easy getting it in, especially with the cooler attached to the motherboard. So I had to put the card in first, tie it to the top left corner of the case and then put the motherboard in and screw it with a long screw driver, and then finally mount the graphics card. But no mods needed and its not too bad once you figure it out.4. Very acceptable temps even at max load.5. With the right cooler, you can fit both a 2.5 inch SSD and 3.5 inch HDD. Both the drive trays are removable for better airflow if you decide not to use them.6. Very clean front with 2 USB3 ports.Cons:1. There are some build quality issues:- The optical drive tray in mine did not line up easily and needed some unnecessary pressure pushing it against the chassis before I could screw it in.- The optical drive seems fine, but it doesn't sit centered in the front panel, its slightly lower on one side.- After finishing the build and placing the rubber case feet, I found that one of them was 3mm off the ground, meaning there was a slight warp to the case. Its a very light case, obviously for greater mobility, but that seems to be affecting its integrity as well. I added a spare rubber foot from a laptop and I added it to the bottom of one of the case feet and it sits firmly now, but I shouldn't have had to do that.2. No card reader provision. It appears they initially intended to have one since there is a provision in the chassis under the front fan for a slim card reader, but they didn't go through with it since there is no provision in the front plastic panel. So unless you're willing to cut it with a dremel (some people have), you can't add a card reader.3. There aren't many options for the SFX power supply. The 450W PSU from Silverstone is very capable but rather pricey for its power rating.4. The USB3 cable for the ports in the front of the case is very stiff and inflexible. It kept coming off the header when installing other parts and puts some strain on the motherboard header.5. Large uninhibited vent holes on the sides and top make this case a dust magnet. The only dust filter is in the front of the case, and its not easy to access it for cleaning. I've mounted the PSU with the intake facing up to build more positive pressure and reduce dust accumulation. What worries me most is that all the air going into my blower-style graphics card is unfiltered from that side of the case.Cons aside, this is really a fantastic mITX case. Most others that support a graphics card are either poorly reviewed or too big. I just wish they would make them with better build quality / steel, though I'm sure that would affect the pricing as well.My build:Silverstone Tek Plastic/SECC Mini-ITX Computer Case with 2x USB 3.0 Front Ports SFF Cases, Black SG05BB-LITESilverstone ST45SF 450 watts SFX form factor power supplyAS Rock LGA1155 DDR3 SATA3 USB3.0 A GbE Mini-ITX Motherboard Z77E-ITXIntel Core i7-3770K Quad-Core Processor 3.5 GHz 8 MB Cache LGA 1155 - BX80637I73770KThermalright AXP-100 (Designed for ITX and HTPC Systems.)Crucial Ballistix Sport Very Low Profile 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3-1600 1.35V UDIMM 240-Pin Memory Modules BLS2C8G3D1609ES2LX0EVGA GeForce GTX670 FTW 2048MB GDDR5 256bit, Dual Dual-Link DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, 4-Way SLI Ready Graphics Card Graphics Cards 02G-P4-2678-KRToshiba TS-L633 8x DVDRW DL Notebook SATA Drive (Black)Intel Network 6235AN.HMWWB Centrino WiFi Card Advanced-N 6235 Dual Band Bluetooth RetailProtronix 2dBi RP-SMA Antenna for Wireless PCI Card or RouterSanDisk Extreme SSD 240 GB SATA 6.0 Gb-s 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive SDSSDX-240G-G25Seagate Barracuda 3 TB HDD SATA 6 Gb/s NCQ 64MB Cache 7200 RPM 3.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive ST3000DM001StarTech.com Slimline SATA to SATA Adapter with Power(SLSATAADAP)

$REVIEW.: I had read many good and bad reviews of the Cinemate II and the only reason I purchased it was because of the excellent return policy.Turns out I did not have to worry

When I first connected the system, the sound was bland and disappointing

I thought I would be returning it ASAP

But then I realized I was on a SD tv station
I turned to SYFY HD and WOW! All the digital stations sound AWESOME!All the SD channels sound better on the TV speakers
The Bose obviously emphasizes the bad as well as the good.If you are getting the Bose Cinemate II, be sure your TV has digital out and you are receiving digital stations


All other configurations that I tried were not so great


But digital TV with digital audio is FANTASTIC.I also do not experience the vocal problems many reviewers stated, but my Sony is on FIXED output which is flat
I wonder if other reviewers had their TVs set for more bass and/or treble while on the TV speakers and forgot to adjust it when they connected the Bose.

Their warranty process is also asinine. Needing the serial number makes sense, but needing a part number and not having this show up in your utility is a PITA. At this point though, don't even think of buying one, Get a newer model Samsung that is a better deal and faster...and works.

$REVIEW.: When this TV is working, it provides an absolutely beautiful picture
 And unlike some sets, it does very well with non-HDTV pictures.But it's not always working


 Since April 2005, I've been through two lamps (one covered by warranty), and had a defective light engine


 The light engine is the mounting for the lamp, and needs to be replaced as an entire unit
 When it goes out, the symptoms are exactly the same as a burned out lamp, except that when you put in a new lamp, the picture stays black

 My light engine was replaced under warranty, which was the good news
 But due to backlogs at the authorized service agency, and backorder for parts, it took 7 weeks to get the set fixed and returned.This problem may exist for all DLPs, or it may just be Toshiba
 Bottom line, I would not buy another Toshiba DLP.If you do get a DLP, don't wait for the light to go out to get a replacement
 Buy one immediately


 They don't go down in price, and they are frequently backordered.

 Less wires and takes up little space.

$REVIEW.: I already have a DCR-SX85, thought I would go for HD, I slit the seal on the box and took the camera out first thing I noticed was a lack of threads on the lens, since I had always been a bit nervous about the lens shutter on my SX-85 and added a Vivitar filter to protect it and the lens this was a instant negative 'feature'
On the plus side Amazon processed my return request and sent UPS the next day to return it.Never even fired it up so I can't say anything about the recording quality but if like me you want to protect the lens or add a wide angle adapter the lack of threads breaks the deal.

$REVIEW.: The One For All remote control is an excellent remote IF you have the original remote controls that you wish to replace. Otherwise, it behaves as a very basic remote. It has buttons for most functions with one glaring omission; there is no eject button. Every VCR, DVD player & Blu-ray player needs to eject its media. Fortunately, since the remote is programmable, you can turn any button into an eject button.This model remote allows you to replace up to eight remotes. You can control your TV, VCR, DVD player, Blu-ray player, cable/satellite box, home theater system and audio equipment.The instructions are awkward but easy to understand. You will probably need to reprogram several other remote functions for each device. You will definitely need working original remotes to accomplish this; don't worry, it is a simple and straightforward process.Additionally, the One For All allows you to create up to eight macros. A macro is a remembered sequence of keystrokes. They allow you to reduce up to 15 key-presses down to two. For example, power on TV, power on DVD player, press play on DVD player. The macro is saved to a number, for example, 1. Once the sequence has been saved, you would then access it by pressing "Macro" and then "1".Although you can replace your original remotes, don't throw them away. You may find a function missing that you will need to program at a later time.All in all this is a very good remote.

I am not going to bore you..Both headphones are outstanding performers with an Ipod...I own them both...So which one is my preference? The Sennheisers, for one reason only...People use their Ipods in malls and on the go. There are times when I want to remove the phones from my ears for a few moments (say, in a store or when having conversation).With the Sennheisers, I can remove the phones from my ears and let them "hang" around my neck in comfort...Try this with the Koss's and they will place a stranglehold on you. For this reason alone, I recommend the Senn's. Both,in my humble opinion, sound equally good.

$review_text.: I read some but not all of the good and bad reviews and I was kind of concerned about the batteries not registering on the camera. Well I have only been able to do a short test but both batteries registered on camera and seem to be working great. I guess time will tell. Considering I bought a used camera this is one deal I couldn't pass up and glad I chose to get the charger with it. The charger that was sent with the camera didn't have the correct wall plug which saved me the headache of having to place another order. Although I have only been able to do a short test on these batteries I am glad I saved my money as they seem to be a decent product. I would recommend them to others. If you don't see an update to this review it means they are still working great.

That way I could listen to NPR stream as I drove cross country and still have a charged iPhone.The cable seemed to work except I noticed phone wasn't charged. A closer look revealed the problem.The apple connector is too big and doesn't connect well. This connection was always marginal and on the rough roads of Texas just wouldn't maintain a connection. After that every day the connection became more marginal and was unusable so I had to revert back to the standard white apple cable that came with the phone.

$review_text.: I think if you are a passionate photographer, you will invest in an SLR even though you may keep this for those spur of the moment pics...and it would be great for that. For me, every picture is a spur of the moment affair. I see something neat looking, grab my F505, an snap away. The auto correct keeps a shaky hand from having an impact on your shots. This is a great feature in my opinion. However, there is actually quite a bit of complexity to this camera. All the features are easily accessible, and can be seen on the viewscreen. My personal favorite is the panaramic feature, and i like the ability to shoot quality videos as well. It does come with an editing program, but i prefer to use Corel for that (or Picasa if I'm not at my own computer). I will also say that the camera holds a charge for a loooonnnnggggg time. Outside of incidentally charging it while i download to my computer, i actually havent had to recharge the battery after the first full charge was set. It has now been almost exactly six months of infrequent use. Of course, now that it isnt snowing anymore, i will probably use it even more. Anyway, i am still playing around with the features, but i definitely recommend the camera. Its value well exceeds its price point in my opinion.Enjoy!

$review_text.: I really do love it

I wanted a nice laptop to process photos and graphic creations
I wasn't looking for anything expensive or all tricked out


I'm an amateur photographer and have a nice desktop that I built to handle all kinds of graphic and video editing

But, when I travel, I wanted to have something small to take with me to tweak my photos before I returned home
This refurbished Asus fit the bill
The specs and the price were perfect

I already have a portable dvd-rom drive so this laptop not having one was not an issue

I was specifically looking for a Windows 7 PC

Everyone I know that has a Windows 8 machine hates it.I've added Total Defense Internet Security Suite for protection

I don't have plans to have this laptop online much and I'm sure this antivirus will be fine
Runs quietly in the background.So far, I only have Adobe Photoshop Elements, Artrage 3 and Corel Aftershot Pro loaded and they all work just fine.The only problem I have is with my external hard drive


It's a fairly newer Western Digital 500GB drive


But, it won't stay connected

The drive works on all my other PCs (home and work)

Just doesn't like this one

Odd since I have an older external drive that works with this laptop just fine.I do love the design

The brushed metal is nice
I like that the screen isn't reflective.The fact that I can get refurbished with a Square Trade warranty for less than brand new makes me happy.

Thirty-five bucks isn't really all that bad.As for the product, I was entirely pleased.  I used this thing to bring an old 2.8GHz P4 machine back to relevance.  I upgraded that PC from 512MB to 1GB (the maximum for the motherboard I had), added this card in place of the old Intel integrated graphics, and installed Windows 7 (didn't use Starter, but I'm sure you could).  I had no trouble getting the drivers I needed; Vista drivers work fine for 7.  The thing won't break any records or blow any minds, but it turned my old PC from 2003 into a fine machine for my mom to play PokerStars on and write up reports with.I haven't tried it, but this would probably be a fine candidate for a Windows Thin PC machine.  That OS just went to RTM this month, but the beta release is still available for free download until the retail release, if anyone wants to try that out.  Just Google it; you'll have to sign into a Windows Live account to download.

$REVIEW.: WOW, is where I will start, this case gets 10 STARS! In the past I reviewed the Case Logic XN SLR-6 med. case and it had MANY flaws. ALL of those flaws have been corrected on this new SLRC-206 case. The area where the camera body goes is now  UNIVERSAL! ANY body will now fit this case even with a Canon 300mm L lens attached, hood reversed! My 20D even fits perfect with a battery grip attached, It is totally universal, BEAUTIFUL! There is now padding all around even the flap that goes around the top over the camera body! The padding is very substantial all over this case, even the small pieces that hold your lenses in place are very thickly padded, moveable and and contoured to hold everything secure. Everything inside is moveable with velcro, even the rubber sling piece the lens slips through, completely adjustable for any use, you can even take out everything inside and use it as a regular backpack! I LOVE THIS CASE and I thank case logic for listening to my review and correcting every single flaw of the XNSLR-6. Even the bottom was well thought out. It has a hard water proof bottom. The zippers are extra big and zip with ease, there are plenty of compartments inside and out. There are velcro tripod straps on the side and another compartment on the other side. There is a handle on the top very well reinforced and well padded shoulder straps and padding on the back where it rests on your back. They thought of everything! All of these GREAT features and best of all this case weighs literally NOTHING! It is very substantial but feather light so go ahead and fill it up, it holds a ton of stuff even a laptop and the weight will be what you put inside not in the case itself like most competitors. It also looks great and the bright yellow interior GREATLY helps you see what's inside, I hate a case with a black interior when you are packing mostly black photo gear! This bag is a 100% improvement over the XNSLR-6. I can't think of one negative thing to say and thats just not normal for me as I am very hard to please.  GET IT! This is an AWESOME case!!!!I noticed there are no interior dimensions mentioned for the photo side of this case just the laptop side so here you go:The camera gear side interior measures 16.5'' tall x 11'' wide x 6.5'' deep, about the size of your average backpack with tons of room. Will easily pass as a carry on bag!

You have to be on a open space in order to work, and when it does, it takes so much to get the data that when you want the shot, most of the time it's with no data.After a while (no more than 6 months) on an intermitent use, the GP-1 unit stopped working

It seems the cable broke down from what I've read

$REVIEW.: The Lowepro Toploader Zoom is the perfect match for a 5D mark i or ii with a 70-200 IS mounted to it. It has enough pockets and accessory add-on slots to carry just about everything that a camera backpack or bag would carry. I feel that the Toploader works best as a "Around Town" bag due to it's compact size instead of having to lug around a backpack or anything larger. BEWARE!!! Though. This bag will not fit a 5Di or 5Dii with Battery Park. For that, go up one step higher to the Toploader 75AW. Unfortunately, I experience this problem and now have to take the Toploader Zoom back. Overall, the bag works out perfect for my camera without the battery pack. High Recommend.
$SUMMARY.: A great "All Around Lens Bag"

$REVIEW.: I ordered two of these StarTech 6-Feet Coax High Resolution VGA Monitor Cables

I use them to connect my desktop PC to my LCD PC-monitor with the resolution set at 1920 X 1080 pixels


One works fine; the other doesn't
 With the bad one, the graphics exhibit ghost images

When I connected this bad one to another monitor, I got even worse result - the display was very dim and reddish


Wriggling it didn't help


One or more pins were not making connections


The picture of the cable in this web page is inaccurate
It depicts connectors with only 14-pins and pin #9 missing

The actual cable I received has all 15 pins, including pin #9


(See my uploaded image.) It is actually a good thing that this cable has all 15-pins because some LCD and plasma TV monitors will not work without pin #9 (See my comment below for further explanation)


The cables look solidly constructed and the price is very reasonable
 However, due to one defective cable out of two in the same order, I only recommend this VGA cable to Amazon shoppers with reservation


 Of course, you can always return it within a month if it turns out to be defective.

$REVIEW.: At the time of this review (October 2012), there are limited case choices for the iPod touch 5th gen since it was released so recently.This case, however, is a good choice.  It is flexible rubber, but has a smooth finish and does not attract lint or "grip" your pocket like some silicone phone cases do.I took one star off because, as another reviewer stated, the case is a little bit loose on the top and bottom;  however I would say it is a "minor" issue, not drastic by any means, and I would still recommend this case, especially for the price.  I do not have a dock, but I haven't experienced any issues with plugging in headphones or the charging/usb cable with the case on.  Buttons are covered yet still easy to push, and the raised areas for the buttons are accurately placed.Overall, I'd say you can't beat it for the price!

$review_text.: I've had three of these drives for about 4 months now.  I've been beating them up pretty hard with a lot of disk access.  They're performing as expected.  I consistently saw greater than 90MB/sec speeds when writing to them from a regular SATA interface.  I've just moved them to an Areca 1210 card in a RAID5 configuration.  I still see 80+MB/sec writing to them, even with them being in the RAID5 config.  The card pretty much erases any noticeable overheard usually seen when writing to a RAID5 array.These drives replaced a pair of Western Digital 'green' drives.  Those crapped out within a week of use.I've got quite a few other Seagate drives in use and have been pretty pleased with their performance and reliability.

$REVIEW.: Overall, I am very happy with the LG HBS-730 Bluetooth headset.Pros:Sound QualityComfortBattery lifeControlsCons:range!If the range was closer to 30 feet, this would be the perfect Bluetooth headset.  As it is, so far it is my favorite Bluetooth headset that I've used over the years.  The battery lasts ALL DAY under constant usage, if not used to talk on the phone, used to listen to music literally all day long.Speaking of the phone, most people tell me they prefer the sound quality of my voice with this headset than over my car Bluetooth or even on the phone itself without Bluetooth.  Pairing with my phone and computer are both very easy.I love the style and comfort of the headset.  I hate Bluetooth headsets that stick in your ear, and with the LG 730 I can wear it under my collar and never even know it's there.  The magnetic cradle for the earbuds works pretty well, and the cord to the earbuds is just about the appropriate length.  It could stand to be an inch longer, but I could see how a bit longer could also be unwieldy.The sound quality is excellent, and the connection has fewer dropouts than any other Bluetooth headset I've ever owned.  I am happy with the tonal quality of these and compare them favorably to most of the wired sets I've used.  They are so comfortable that I often forget they are there.The problem I have is with the range.  At MOST, I can get about 15 feet out of them, then they start dropping out badly.  As I get closer to 20 feet the sound nearly disappears, and by about 25~30 feet they disconnect from the source.  These distances are repeatable and measurable, I've even gone so far as to lay a tape measure on the ground with my phone on one end and as I start to walk away, every time I hit the 15' mark, the dropouts start.  If there is a wall between me and the headset, the distances decrease even more.  In theory, this is unacceptable for Bluetooth to suffer this poor range, but in practice it seldom becomes an issue since I am usually connected to my phone and my phone is usually in my holster on my hip.  But, if I am connected to my laptop and get up to go to the restroom or something, or if my phone is on the charger and I get up and move around, then it becomes a legitimate performance issue.That said, I still rate the LG HBS-730 as four stars since in every other way it is truly a superb headset.  If the Bluetooth connection actually had a 30 foot range, it would easily be a five star product!  I still recommend the LG HBS-730 to all my friends and to anyone who desires a Bluetooth headset.

Not having the income to purchase a two-hundred- dollar video card replacement, as well as my thinking about getting a imac in the near future, I opted instead for the Diamond BVU195 HD Display Adapter.  The adapter provided exactly what I needed.  A way to have dual monitor support without the high-end video card price tag.  The one drawback appears to be that some quicktime and flash video is garbled on the monitor connected to the diamond card.  However, it appears this might just be a Windows XP driver issue.

$review_text.: I cannot say I don't like Samsung items as my television is a Samsung and it has been terrific for a number of years
 I was offered the chance to review this item and I was quite excited.1


 What's in the box?:  You receive the player, which from examples from years ago is quite small actually


 There are the usual paraphenelia instructions, offers and such, and that is about it.2
 Aesthetic?:  Well, it is a black box after all

 I suppose this is a nice looking box with the interesting curved side on the right side, which gives this item some flair


 The Samsung label is typical for their products


 As well, the buttons are merely touch buttons on the top left


 The display is bright and clearly visible.3

 Use?:  The first thing is not to put a disc in immediately upon turning on the power


 I did this because I love not reading the instructions and this was a mistake until I then reset the machine
 Once past that debacle, this was an easy set up
 You are directed to the display screen which gives you the menu for the machine

 You will set-up the language and then the wireless network


 You may also be directed to upgrade the software

I utilized this system with HDMI and a receiver connected to my TV

 This does have digital output, but seriously, you should be using a system with HDMI these days and if not, you should upgrade your system.DVD:  When you place the item in your tray, the display screen lets you know this and you can still do other things, by the way

 However, the DVD loads VERY quickly
 Plus, I should mention that this player has a drawer that disappears behind a small door, unlike older players
 Images appear to be quite nice

Although I am not certain this is merely a function of just the player.Network:  One really nice feature is the ability of this player to use your wifi for other features


 For example, Youtube, Pandora and some limited other apps via Opera can be used


 This player easily located my network, although it appears to be limited to merely 2.5Ghz and not 5.0 Ghz, which is a bit disappointing
 The player is not hyper-fast, and Youtube takes a bit to load, but it isn't horrible in my opinion


 The screen also allows you to access the USB drive and you can also switch devices to access other media available in your network


 Again, this process isn't lightning quick, but it seems fairly snappy to me in my experience.There isn't a browser that is obvious to me, but Opera is present with the ability to download a few different apps that are available

 This is the one flaw at present as Netflix and others are available but there is no Amazon Prime

 Though I understand that is apparently because of some codec issues that may later be resolved

 So at this juncture, this is a bit disappointing
 However, this may change (and the player can be set to remind you of new software changes available).Issues:  I have found that the default settings may cause some problems if you are not aware of them

 First off, ensure the sound is set to the right settings for your system.Overall:  I am pretty impressed by the quality of the system, especially for the cost


 The wifi ability really gives this a lot of capabilities that my older DVD player did not present


 This makes my older dumb TV a smart TV without the cost


 I can imagine once Amazon Prime is available that will makes this really useful (I don't use Netflix at this time)
DVDs and Blu-rays load very quickly and play easily


 Images (available using HDMI) are quite nice.

$review_summary.: Great player with many features
 One flaw so far...

I have a wired HP network printer and I thought that this would let me print to it, away from the router, and while it does, it is not the most reliable. I have had to power cycle it about once every couple months, and completely re-add both the adapter and the printer to the network every six months or so. I think the printer expects some consistency in IP address, but I'm less than an expert in network management.

$review_text.: I have been using this since 2009 to extend my network at home.  The setup was not too bad.  It works okay, but I notice that it seems to get confused when multiple devices are within range.  This extender will just crap out when it sees contention from multiple devices.  It usually happens when I boot up a new device or shut down a device within range.  Once this happens then any device which was using the extender without an issue and still running will become disconnected from the network.  I get the limited or no network access message.  So then I have to go over to the extender and unplug it then plug it immediately back in and then my device will work again.  I unplug and plug this extender anywhere between 2 - 8 times a day due to other devices coming into range and booting up or shutting down.  For some reason the insides of this thing just get all messed up when this happens.Here is an example.  My home computer is using this extender in the far bedroom of my house.  I am using the home computer fine.  I decide to turn on the wifi on my smart phone.... Boom!  My home computer now has limited or no internet connectivity.  Unplug, plug, network extender and .... home PC reconnected... now I have network connectivity again.  Oh, I decide now to turn off the wifi on my smartphone... Boom!  My home computer now again has limited or no internet connectivity.  Repeat as needed.I don't recommend this device.

The system was much smaller and more tasteful than almost any of the others on the retail shelves - and the sound is unbelievable for a system this size.  It plays my MP3-RW disks with no problem and reads them very quickly.  I haven't made use of the PC-connection capabilities, as the systema and my PC are in different rooms, but it's nice to know the capability is there.  I researched a lot before buying - and you can't get anything better for the money.  I heartily recommend it.

$REVIEW.: A teleflash accessory like this one focuses the beam emitted by an electronic flash so that it carries farther and consequently illuminates subjects at a greater distance from the camera. Normally, even the most versatile flash unit is adjustable to no greater telephoto length than 85mm. or so. If one is taking bird photos (for example) using a long telephoto lens, however, much of the light emitted by the flash ends up wasted. Using a mounted fresnel lens, the "Better Beamer" creates a more narrow beam of flash-light, which consequently is effective at greater distances than the flash would reach otherwise.The big advantage of the Better Beamer design is that the unit can be disassembled to fold flat when not in use. This makes it convenient to carry in the field. With a little practice it can be mounted on the head of one's flash unit fairly quickly.When using this device to photograph birds or animals, it's really best to find a way to mount the flash at least some small distance up and away from the camera body. If the flash is simply attached via the camera's hot shoe, there is a danger that the photos will exhibit the animal equivalent of "redeye," which can turn out white, blue, or green, depending on the animal's physiology. This can usually be corrected in post-processing, but it's really better to find a way to avoid the problem altogether. There are various kinds of off-camera flash brackets made for teleflash; these are made by Wimberley, Really Right Stuff, and Kirk Enterprises, to name just a few companies.It's also best not to use teleflash as the sole source of illumination for a bird or animal photo, if this can possibly be avoided. Photos that are lit only by flash look artificial. The teleflash ideally serves as in-fill light that also creates a bit of sparkle in the animal's eye(s). Mastering the art of combining ambient and flash illumination takes practice and sometimes a bit of luck. If one sets up exposure to allow generously for natural light in a low-light situation, there is a danger of image "ghosting," i.e., the animal might move a bit during the time the shutter is open, creating a double or blurred image. But if one using high shutter-speed synch to eliminate ghosting, the photo might end up appearing as though it were taken at night (not necessarily what one wants).  This is a craft that requires practice and judgment.Overall, the Better Beamer currently is THE standard unit for teleflash photography, and I recommend these units highly. However, as the subject line for this review indicates, the FX-3 is NOT ideally designed for the Nikon SB-800 and SB-600 flash units. There is an FX-4 unit that fits these flash heads nicely. You can create small cardboard shims to make non-fitting units function in the field (I did this for a while), but why not buy the correct unit to begin with?

$review_text.: Dec 12, 2011: Initially I liked the printer very much (see below)...BUT it is now 4 months old and will not print correctly (missing colors, missing text/numbers, lines across photos etc etc)

 I have replaced cartridges more than once, and aligned/cleaned printhead more than once
 It's no help
 Kodak supposedly is ending me a new printhead under warranty in a few days
 In meantime, I will be looking at other brands of printer.---Sept 1, 2011: Having been an HP OfficeJet All In One printer user for more than a dozen years, I was somewhat reluctant to leave the HP world and try another brand, but am very glad I did

 The Kodak 6150 is easy to set up and use, a bit noisier than the HP but seems just as fast, and print quality is more than acceptable


 Am looking forward to the lesser print costs that Consumer Reports found in its recent article
 I use the printer with a USB cable, so can't comment on wireless mode.

$review_text.: The Amazon Basics line of products usually provides good value, and is often as good as the big-name version at a fraction of the price. This particular product, a generic GPS mount, is an incomplete attempt. It addresses the need for a beanbag-style mount at a reasonable price, but doesn't achieve the level of functionality the brand-name mounts offer. This may be a function of its stated purpose - to be universal, it relies on the suction cup that comes with most GPS units. Those just don't work as well on plastic as on glass. My unit, a Garmin, lost suction after 30-60 minutes, and sooner than that if the sun was shining directly on it. I also tried it with a friend's unit, a Magellan. The Magellan's suction mount held for a longer time, but my friend's car has a curved dash, and the Amazon mount isn't flexible enough to follow its contours, so the whole assembly flopped around disconcertingly. My car has a flat dash so it was reasonably stable there, but not as good as my everyday mount (a Garmin beanbag). I guess if you have a fairly flat dash AND a powerful suction cup this unit would work for you, but it's a compromise. A positive mechanical mount, like a ball-and-socket, simply works better, and is worth the extra money.
$SUMMARY.: Not good for curved dashboards or weak suction cups.

$review_text.: I've had my share of bread makers in the past, and this one is among the top that I've used.Pros:* Easy to use. Comes with instructions. After you've done it a few times, it barely takes any thought.* Easy to clean. Everything comes apart.* Lightweight. In my small kitchen, I just don't have room to leave it out all the time, which means packing it away in the cupboard in between uses. I love that it's easy to move around the kitchen and I can pull it back out without any effort at all.* Great recipes. I've only tried the French Bread so far, but I definitely have my eye on trying a few more. The pesto bread sounds great.Cons:* Moves around a bit. Not hugely, but the machine gets shaken around a bit that it definitely does not stay in the same spot the entire time.* Small-ish loaves. It works out for me because I don't have many people to feed, but families may need larger models.* Bare minimum. This isn't really a con, so much as a reminder that this is a lower-end model bread maker. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles, nor does it do tons of fancy stuff. There are some optional modes that I haven't really worked with, but the instructions on them are sparse at best. If you want a fancy bread maker, you should probably look at a different model.

$review_text.: For me, this size is the sweet spot for SSD
Nothing better than having enough storage to get rid of the hard drive for a couple years


When my apple care runs out I will buy a kit that turns my super drive into an external and makes that drive bay available for the original 750gb spinner I took out


Or maybe I'll put another SSD in


Or a hybrid drive
The point is that you can do all that.For the SSD itself, I've found it to be very speedy, the Mac book pro is on from startup to sign on in under half a minute
I think 17 seconds was my last timed start up


Programs or apps load instantly, even spotify and iTunes


There are a couple of things you need to do if you want the speed maximized


Trim enabler for Mac is important


Also it's important to find and install the latest firmware

I initially had a problem with this, and after a week I tried again and did the firmware update correctly, seeing speeds hit the top of their rated specs.One more thing
This SSD didn't come with a cable or the software to transfer everything

But they're cheap and easy to get

Before you clone your hard drive run all the tools to maximize its efficiency
There are online guides and YouTube videos for help if you need it.All and all I think I got a good price for a great product, and the price keeps going down on this


 So you will probably get a better price than I did.

I have a macbook pro 15" 2010 and I replaced the HDD for this one
I cloned the Mac portion with Carbon Copy Cloner and then cloned the Windows portion with Winclone
In order for Windows to work properly, you may need to click the "Replace BCD file" when you restore the image


After that everything worked 100% blazing fast
I replaced my optical disk drive with a 1tb 5400 rpm samsung HDD for extra storage and bought an external enclosure for the optical drive

I also formatted the 1tb to NTFS format and purchased paragon NTSF for mac to be able to write to it


So now I have my Mac running bootcamp and a 1tb HDD able to be read by both sides, which makes things EASIER!Also for some people, you may have a "slow" boot before the apple logo appears after a clone
It may not happen if you don't rename your drive name like I did but it's noteworthy

All you need to do is go into System Preferences -> Startup Disk and make sure OSX is selected.Now I am just waiting for the 512gb to go drastically down in price and I will buy another

$REVIEW.: I purchased the EG005W six months ago. Since I installed, it has been working 24/7 flawlessly, hooked to three PCs with gigabit ethernet (two systems with Intel's PRO 1000/MT PCI cards and one with a Realtek 8139 PCI card).I obtain gigabit links to all three systems using regular Cat "5e" cables (believe me, if you don't need super long cables, cat5e is just good enough, no need for the more expensive cat6), and the speed is only limited to about 400mbps by the 33Mhz PCI BUS, not by the switch (to obtain the full bandwidth, you need a system with Gigabit built on the system board which bypasses the PCI bus bandwidth limitation). Still, 4x faster than 100mbit fast ethernet is a huge improvement.VNC sessions from one system to the other over gigabit feels almost like a local session.Very stable unit, can be stacked on top of other likewise Linksys units (mine sits on top of a BEFSR41 ethernet firewall/router). Cons? It's got an internal fan. So if you have a bunch of Linksys devices, you need to place the EG005W on top, to allow proper air flow.The fan is not _very_ noisy, just noticeable. Like a notebook's fan during normal operation.

$REVIEW.: Pros: When using the USB HD the quality of AVI files is acceptable. Good control of subtitles and audio tracks.Cons are as follows:1.In spite of many efforts the unit could not be properly installed in my workgroup through the ethernet. I have changed a lot of sharing options in win 7 home network but without any positive results. The other devices, like HDTV and printer are seen and working properly in the workgroup.The player constanly requires password with Realtek user ID. Other user IDs and passwords are not working.2.Technical support is unreachable. I have sent them e-mail 2 days ago and no response until today.They recommended to change sharing setup in the workgroup. After I had made my files less secure the files became accessible.I think it is the firmware design problem. They were not ready for windows 7. Actually, the downloaded files should be in the public folders to have other folders password protected. This is a huge negative point of the player.3.Device is very slow with the remote control operation and you have to push buttons several times due to poor sensitivy of the IR sensor or just bad remote. In addition, the remote buttons are inconvenient to push butyou have to use the remote very often when using this device.4.When watching movies with USB HD the remote control sometimes not operative at all until the movie ends. I will try to avoid Micca products.It is very strange that the company has no adress and phone numbers on its website or in the manual.The device is not so cheap to treat customers like that. I have changed my rating from 1 to 2 after receive response from support.

$review_text.: I've tried setting up the Verbatim 98423 MediaShare with my iPhone 5 and iPad.  Getting the software and wifi connection was straightforward and easily done.  I'm still figuring out how to control the Mediashare using the iOs app and synch data.  But so far, the app isn't hard to figure out.  I was able to watch videos from a usb on my iPhone almost immediately.  Transferring photos from the iPhone to a USB is also a simple operation.The device isn't heavy but it feels sturdy. Easy to bring on a trip.

$REVIEW.: If you have read my reviews you can see I build a lot of computers. I own at least 100 hard drives and have gone through the quality issues of all the suppliers. This external hard drive dock is fantastic. They are the best tools you can have to support and test your computer's storage drives at home. The dock will hold any internal SATA drive for a server, desktop, laptop or SSD drive for testing and cloning of your primary boot drive or backing up data.You can quickly plug in, test and format a new drive before you install it into your computer. Yeah I have even purchased new drives that we bad out of the box. I have even had Seagate send me several refurbished HDD's that were bad out of the box so I started testing them before I install them into a computer or a server.  It is a lot easier to do it before hand before you lose data and even more time.  Using the proper software you can clone your primary boot drive and store it somewhere for that rainy day when your computer doesn't work anymore. Eventually it will happen!What makes this docking station so good is the easy plug in and out of the hard drive and offering a USB connection to your computer. It literally takes seconds to install your HDD and connect to your computer. The connection method support high speed data transfer and the docking station is open so you have heat dissipation without a cooling fan. I have seen some people use these as a desktop HDD holder for continuous use but I don't recommend that. You have a device running power with an open exposed circuit board (on 3.5 inch HHDs) and HDDs are subject to static discharge damage. In my opinion it is for testing, setup and cloning and not for a permanent external drive.This is a must have tool for anyone who works on computers for themselves or friends. I own several external docking stations for this reason.
$SUMMARY.: One of the best troubleshooting tools you can have for your computers!

$review_text.: I don't have much to add to the other reviews, and I like this unit a lot
It can do almost everything my Roku can do.I just don't, however, love the remote control (which is included, despite what they tell you in the Comparison Chart)


 If you're using the smartphone remote app or a Harmony, you can stop reading now.My beef concerns the four directional arrows near the bottom, surrounding the 'OK' button

The arrows form a circle, such that each arrow is curved
 Unfortunately, just above that cluster is another set of curved arrows -- one for &#34;pop up menu&#34;, the middle one marked &#34;INTERNET&#34;, and the third for &#34;picture&#34;

 And by &#34;just above&#34; I mean that it's all too easy, when trying to use the 'up' arrow, to mash the INTERNET button instead


This makes for no small amount of frustration.Otherwise, I like it a lot.

$review_text.: "What a great, no awesome universal remote. As it can control up to 15 different devices, this remote replaces every other remote you have. I even have it controlling my lighting setup! Initial setup is really easy as you simply follow the prompts on the Logitech website. This remote is replacing my Harmony 880 which I had for three years. The 880 is going to the downstairs theater where it will operate 5 devices. I had no problem in justifying this purchase with my better half since she was completely at ease with the 880. Her familiarity with the Harmony line was a no brainer. She just loves the Harmony One as it is even easier to operate than the 880. My kids have no problem as well as the entire family can operate it with no problems. Since I have the 880, programming was very easy for me. To the first time user, there will be a slight learning curve to really get out everything you need from the Harmony One. The time and effort is worth it in every sense. I simply can not imagine life without the Harmony One. The product is that good!! Not to mention, the One looks and feels just right. When friends come over to the house, they all want to play with the Harmony One. It is hilarious to watch. I can sum it up as follows. The Harmony One is the I-Pod of remotes. Some of my friends have purchased their own Harmony One after visiting our house. This is especially helpful when we go over to their house, as we know how to operate their remote. They come over to our house and vice versa. Now, if only they can add phone functionality to the next version..................I just might be on to something really good.Enough reading, go out and purchase one of these. Your life will be forever changed. I guarantee it!!!"

I was accustomed to recharging batteries every couple of months, but if this can live up to it's claim of 18 months, I'm very satisfied.Although this is a wonderful mouse for the above-mentioned features, if you are looking for a full-sized desktop mouse and are concerned with comfort due to carpal tunnel or arthritis, I would recommendLogitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse (Black)instead.

$review_text.: I tried this camera for a very specific purpose:  The HD video quality had to greatly exceed that of my Fujifilm F10's VGA video quality


 In a head-to-head comparison, it flunked
 The resolution at 720 Fine was not quite as sharp as the F10, and the autofocus searched excessively


 The macro function is also not as good as the F10, losing focus at about twice the distance from the subject

 For someone less fussy, who doesn't already own an F10, it might be a fine choice


 My F10 is 5 years old or so

 I hope we don't have to wait too much longer for truly crisp HD in a point and shoot

 The limitation might be the compression
 It's in motion video that the new Sony seems to lose out.

$review_text.: (4.5 stars)This portable DVD player by Phillips really comes in handy when I am on a commuter train into the city or when I just want to prop myself up in bed and watch a DVD! The machine just plains looks and feels very well made (which it is); and I give it high marks for being so easy to use even without reading the directions which come in several different languages. The remote is remarkably thin but it works like a charm and the quality of the widescreen picture is really quite good. The sound is good and you can easily adjust it if you wish. It comes with a car adaptor so your children or others can watch a movie while you're on the road; and the electric power supply with its cord is reliable. The rechargeable battery pack allows up to 2 hours but actually I would count on it lasting about 1  hours; batteries always seem to run down fast when the machine is playing a DVD.  It also plays MP3s and CDs so you have the option of keeping your portable CD player at home and just use this alone instead. It works with many different types of earphones so you can watch movies and listen to music without disturbing others. Some of the buttons and knobs on the DVD player itself are pretty small but they should not pose any real problems for you when you operate this.This DVD player is pretty slender so it fits easily into a carryon bag if you take this on an airplane when you go on vacation. I wouldn't pack it in a suitcase because suitcases get bumped around in flight; and sometimes suitcases aren't handled with the same care that you give to your carryon luggage.There's one cautionary note about this DVD player, however. It will play DVDs that we buy and own here in America--and Canada as well. It also plays my DVDs that I make when I record a movie off the television. However, it plays only PAL DVDs--and NOT (sorry, but I must repeat NOT) play Region 2 DVDs. Be careful of this before you purchase this machine. Some people (and I used to be one of them so I'm not looking down my nose at you) think that Region 2 is just another way of saying PAL DVDs. Unfortunately, for some technical reason, PAL DVDs and Region 2 DVDs are not the same. If you need a portable DVD player that can also play Region 2 DVDs (which are primarily manufactured in Great Britain and other European countries) you need to look further.Overall, I recommend this portable DVD player for people who want to watch their DVDs, both commercial and homemade, wherever they are. It's very well made and you can use it to keep anyone entertained in the car on road trips, too. Just please remember that while it can play PAL DVDs it cannot play Region 2 DVDs. Otherwise this is a very good portable DVD player.

$review_text.: I love my husband and I LOVE my kids but I LLLLOOOOVVVVVEEEE my Kindle Fire HD.  Get it?  I have tried many cases.  Including a corner secured model where my son's HD actually bounced out of the case when dropped.  In slow motion.  To everyone's horror.  In case you're wondering it is cost prohibitive to replace a shattered screen. A shattered screen makes a Kindle worthless.  I have also tried the mesh cornered cases.  The Kindle barely fits, the screen is obscured and I end up taking the kindle out for use. What's the point?However this case actually works like an envelope securing every edge of the kindle when closed.  Open the cover and the screen is unobstructed for use.  When I accidentally dropped my kindle, there was zero damage.  I haven't taken this out of the case since I got it, mortgage desired to.  You barely realize the cover is in place while using.  Also it does work as a stand on a flat surface for hands free use.  For protection and function-wrap it up.

$REVIEW.: It is important that you use a screen protector to ensure that your Kindle screen remains scratch-free
 The nice part about this product is that it comes with three screen protectors..
which is useful if you have multiple devices in your home (and even if you only have one device, it's good to replace screen protectors from time to time)

 You may need more than one right off the bat, because sadly air bubbles are a possibility - be sure your screen is completely free from dust/debris before applying this protector.I have tested several different screen protectors on the Kindle


 This product is okay, but if you want the best then I'd recommend this:Moshi iVisor XT (HD clear) No-Bubble Screen Protector for Kindle Fire HD 7"

$REVIEW.: Upon opening this product, I can see that this product is heavily influenced by Apple product packaging. The pastel blue and white color and the compactness of this product is pleasing to the eye. The separate micro-USB cable can be plugged into the provided power adaptor to power up the device from the power plug. Or it can just be used simply by itself to connect TL-WR702N to any USB ports to power up the device.I am able to use the default AP mode out-of-box, just by plugging in the Ethernet cable connecting my cable mode to this TL-WR702N device and the micro-USB power adaptor. I performed a speed test on both my cable modem and the TL-WR702N. The ping/upload/download results are comparable.I have this device mainly to use this as a repeater. There are certain blind spots in my bedroom, where the 802.11 wireless connectivity is close to null. Forget the quick installation guide that comes with the product. I suggest using the CD to download the user's guide or go to TP-Link to access the user's guide. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. I am able to set the TL-WR702N as a repeater in no time.

$review_text.: I bought this to be able to play music from my Surface Pro though my home stereo. This nifty little gadget allows me to do so without any wires!Getting it to pair was a somewhat hit and miss proposition. It took a bit of fiddling, and the instructions aren't the greatest. I think what I decided was that if you hold the button down for a long time (&#62;10 seconds), it seems to delete any stored parings and start fresh. The (lousy) instructions didn't mention it though and I never fully confirmed this to be true though so I may be mistaken.Most of my complaints are probably more a problem with the Bluetooth devices I was trying to connect to it. With the Surface tablets (we also used my wife's Surface RT), there is no way to disconnect from the receiver without either uninstalling the driver or the aforementioned &#34;hold the button down until it deletes all the pairings&#34; trick. Neither are very convenient. If you leave it paired, it will reconnect any time you walk within range and you will suddenly lose sound to the built in speakers. The first time it happened, it took me a while to figure out what was going on since the stereo was turned off at the time and I had no sound at all.The other complaint is the volume just isn't that high. I almost feel like I need to get a pre-amp for it. I don't know if it is because the output levels of the Surface tablets are low, or if the output from the receiver is low. At any rate, even having the volume all the way up on the stereo wasn't unbearably loud.Others have complained of problems with it ceasing to function, but so far I haven't run in to that problem. Basically if you can't get it to pair up, delete the driver/device from the Bluetooth settings and let it create a new one.In summary, it serves the purpose intended. We were able to pair it with both tablets with only minimal fuss, although of course only one can be connected at a time. The output levels could be higher, but the quality is good. I'll ding them one star for the weak instructions, low output levels, and inconvenient means of detaching from the transmitting device.

$REVIEW.: I run the video cameras during our church service every Sunday using three cameras


 The two church-owned cameras are mounted and remote controlled
 The third camera, my own, is mounted onto a tripod in the back of the sanctuary

 My problem was getting enough camera height to shoot over peoples' heads when the congregation is standing

 To gain additional height, I first bought a tripod dolly that added eight inches


 This was not enough, so I tried the Manfrotto Single Articulated Arm mounted onto the tripod for an additional twelve inches

 The twenty inches of additional height made a big difference

 My camera weighs about 3.4 pounds, making it right at the maximum load
 I am only using the one arm for the added twelve inches


 I was afraid that by extending it to the maximum 23.8 inches, it would not be stable enough
 It works well, and is as stable as the camera without the extension


 The quality is very good
 It is all metal except for the plastic knobs


 The fitting for mounting onto a tripod screw is also metal
 It is not the cheapest piece of hardware, but anything that is all metal will cost more.

$review_text.: The case fit our Canon Powershot SD880, with just a bit of room to spare.I really liked the solid feel of the case - it almost feels safe enough for short drops to the floor, and feels somewhat weather resistant


Although it has a belt loop, my wife would really have much preferred an external loop


She worked around this by having the camera's loop strap hang out of the case.The inside pouch is generous enough to fit the usual memory card sizes (such as CompactFlash or SecureDigital)
However, you won't be able to store a spare battery in this pouch
In addition, any memory card that you drop in there will take some work to dig out - unlike some other cases, the card storage area is fairly deep but isn't compartmentalized.As with any camera case, you really should handle it yourself, to ensure that it not only fits the target camera, but also fits in your storage area


My wife was really thrilled that it was compact enough to fit in her purse, and also didn't add much bulk to the camera itself.Happy clicking!

Anti-glare is nice, and the thickness doesn't seem to affect the use of the touch screen.When applying the thick film, I was able to see that I needed to remove and re-align it several times before finally committing.  It handled this nicely, much better than I expected.In the end the application was difficult to make "bubble free", due to dust and static in the air.I guess its not fair to this product to take off stars for my real issue, but I'm going to share it as it may help someone else:Winter time in the north midwest usa is not the time or place to install rigid screen protectors.  No matter what I did to clean the screen, blow off the dust, discharge static electricity from myself or the device, a particle or two would get between the film and the screen. It's pretty amazing how large a bubble can be created by a speck of dust behind a firm screen like this. BTW, a Dyson vacuum doesn't pick up much of anything from the room I was working in either, so the work space was *clean*.  I don't have access to a real "clean room" facility either... sigh.  Plan accordingly.
$review_summary.: Thick-ish but not overly so, nice, application can be challenging

$review_text.: First, navigation is bad. It cannot find a Costco store in Van Nuys, a Whole Foods in Sherman Oaks and many similar stores that have been there forever. Selecting a "favorite" location takes several clicks, and you have to wait till the unit is completely ready. If you don't sit in your parking space for a whole minute after turning on the engine, this means you are going to make this series of button clicks while driving. Ouch.Next, media playback. The forward/backward rewind buttons are disabled if you are playing files from a USB or DVD media. You can skip the track, or go to the start of the track. Absolutely unacceptable.Last, bluetooth. About once a month, the KCA-BT200 unit (required for bluetooth connection) will lose pairing with the phone. You have to watch if it has connected to the phone every time you start the car (not visible from the NAV screen), and reset the connection - again, a long and painful process.

$REVIEW.: I have been an ASUS user for some time now, and I have purchased a number of ASUS CrossHair motherboards over the last few years. And while many view this line of motherboards as a gamer's dream board, I on the other hand do not purchase this line for that purpose. I like robust computing, and the CrossHair series has provided that for me, and since I am an AMD fan, I have not been disappointed. Starting with the original CrossHair, I have gradually moved up the series as it improved. The CrossHair V, Formula-Z has shown an increase in performance, even with the small step up from the CrossHair V Formula. Pairing it with a top end AMD 8-core processor, 32GB of ram and a solid state primary drive make this one ugly beast, and I have not been disappointed in the least. It was easy to set up, runs quiet, and once it starts, buckle up for safety, because it runs like lightning in a bottle.

I on the other hand did a little homework and found this simple little gadget was exactly as advertised. "A SWITCH", simply put, Take in my case 3 HDMI cables plug into the switch, take the 1 main switch cable plug into TV. Done:)  My kids play with their Playstation they simply turn the PS on, the "Auto-Switch"  magically tunes to the PS.  When they are done, they simply turn the PS off and wah-la the "Auto-Switch" tunes back to my cable box (if its on). No more physically pushing any buttons, the switch does this automatically.  Now I wish I bought one with more HDMI ports.  Maybe next time.

$review_text.: Pioneer BDC-2202 this is currently the cheapest Blu-ray drive, but it does not burn Blu-ray discs
 It burns DVDs and CDs only, and reads Blu-ray discs, DVDs, and CDs


 For some people that may be enough, since Blu-ray burning is still impractically slow and expensive.The drive requires serial ATA (SATA) interface, but does not come with a SATA cable, which you need to connect the drive to your motherboard.Pioneer's web site has a list of compatible motherboards for this drive, which you may want to see before buying the drive


 Mine is on the list, but I still had to update its SATA drivers before I can burn successfully.Bundled software includes WinDVD 8 LE (which plays Blu-ray movie discs), Ulead VideoStudio 11 SE, and Ulead Burn.Now SE.I tested with seven Blu-ray movie discs -- "Flightplan," "Memento," "Apocalypto," "Descent," "Basic Instincts," "The Untouchables," and "Dog Day Afternoon" -- and this drive played them all successfully on PowerDVD Ultra.To play Blu-ray movies (and HD DVDs, for that matter), your PC needs to be fast enough and equipped with HDCP-compliant graphic card and monitor.I can burn CDs and single layer DVDs with no problem
 But I cannot burn dual layer DVD+R ("Matrix" brand bought from shop4tech), not even with Nero Buring Rom

 I'll have to try other brands of media.EDIT 8/11/09:Last year I found 2 brands of dual-layer discs that I could burn with this drive:Verbatim 95310 8.5 GB 2.4X Dual-Layer DVD+R, bought at Amazon, andMatrix DVD+R Media 8.5G 8X Dual Layer Bulk (Item SKU: MATDL+R8X/B), bought at [...].

$REVIEW.: Absolutely SICK!First and foremost I must say that I paid $20 for these, and these produce 10 times the sound you pay for. These may be the best $20 ear buds around (depending on your musical preference). With that in mind let's review.The housing seems pretty tough, and the cords are what you would expect (thick), but I would've expected a bit more heft at the jack. The 3.5 jack is NOT angled or reinforced very well--this may lead to shorting out after extended use.So, they aren't the most durable looking earbuds, true, but these little buds rock!I compared these to V-Moda: Bass Freq, Sennheiser: CX300 and iPod factory ear buds.V-Moda: Both the V-Modas and JVCs offer smooth, deep bass--but the JVCs sound much clearer, crisper and punchier. They sound surprisingly clean and clear considering how heavy the bass is. They don't offer the sound staging of my Klipsch Image S4 or Sennheiser CX300...but ohhh that sweet crunchy BASS!CX300: The JVCs have a much more full and encompassing bass response, but the mids and highs are a little canned and less present; not nearly the same staging characteristics as the CX300.iPod: Everything is better than these...NOTE* These are not IEMs for sound clarity audiophiles...these are Xtreme buds for banging heavy music (metal, hip-hop, Dubstep, D&B;).So, If you are looking for overall sound quality and staging, go for the Sennheiser CX300, Klipsch Image S4 or something similar to those. If you are looking for more aggressive sound and more durable buds, look to the JVCs--It's kind of a "choose your battle" situation.Honestly, if you want deep bass, crisp highs, and great staging, you should look to Shure, Etymotic Research or Ultimate Ears (though I think UE has very poor customer service)

$review_text.: I've had my Sony headphones for nearly three years and they should have died by now given what happened to them. These headphones are designed for the moist environment associated with working out. When I accidentally washed them in a pair of jeans, they survived the washing machine without noticeable damage. How's that for tough?The coiled design provides a tight fit, holding them in place for those who are active. The fit may be a little snug for some and it does take a moment to orient them to put them on correctly, but I like the secure feeling. The 90 degree angle of the stereo plug reduces stress at the connection to your audio source. That's a nice feature. Sound quality is solid for this price range. Upper and mid range is quite good, but deep bass passages at high volume can push it beyond its capabilities at times. The bass response is similar to what many other similarly priced headphones provide.If you are looking for a reasonably priced, workout friendly pair of headphones or just a solid set of headphones that sound nice, the Sony Mdr-As50G Active Style Spiral Neck-Band Headphones are a good choice.

$review_text.: I LOVE this case! It offers great protection to my new Kindle Touch and it's easy to use the Kindle in the case


The cover is held in place by the elastic band and you can bend the cover to the back and hold it in place there using the same band
 The tab on the band makes it easy to grab

I got the green one and both shades of green are vibrant! Someone mentioned that the material is cheap

 I disagree


 It feels like real leather, not at all cheap

 The inside of the cover is soft and has a nice "grip-ability" to it so that I have a firm hold on my Kindle while I'm reading with the cover folded back

 When I didn't have the Kindle in a case, it was, of course, thinner, but it also felt like I could easily drop it


 Not anymore.Shipping was quick


Item arrived way before I expected it

 Highly recommend.

$review_text.: Got this TV at Walmart along with a bluray player.  It replaced my old picture tube television and my DVD player.  I've heard all the talk about LED, HD, 1080p, Blu rays, and I'm sure you have, too.  I got a blu ray player as a gift and didn't want to hook it up to my old CRT television so I went and bought this LED TV.At first glance, the TV didn't impress me because the images were a little fuzzy.  As per recommendation, I went out and purchased an HDMI cable and the display improved drastically.  I picked up a cable at a bargain outlet for 5 bucks.  Now the movies are bright and colorful.  Very nice!In hooking up some older game systems, the screen is still fuzzy using the RCA (red, yellow and white) jacks, but I assume that would be the case with all older systems.  The new Xbox 360 and PS3 should be fine.The sound, like others have said, isn't very good.  Sounds like something you would find on a laptop computer. The sound is clear and doesn't seem to be any distortion, but there's just no bass whatsoever.  Should be ok for a small room though.  The control buttons on the screen are touch sensitive and light up when you touch them, but you can't see them unless you touch them and even still, they are not labeled, so it's hard to tell what button you are pressing!  The buttons are labeled on the LED screen and this is really stupid.Like others have said, the screen is tilted backward and there's no way to adjust it, so I put a book under the back of it to tilt it a little bit forward.  The remote seems really cheap and awkward... feels like it would break easily.Another complaint I have, is that there's no audio output except for some fiber optic port for a soundbar.  So that kinda sucks too.But other than those minor complaints, the TV has a nice display.  I'll give 4 stars.  Minus one for the tilted screen, cheap remote, goofy onscreen controls and lack of sound.

$REVIEW.: I've been using this little speaker for about a month


It works great! The sound is quite good considering how small it is
It's very lightweight
I hung it in my shower on one of those suction cup hooks you can buy at Target
I don't put it under running water but it has no problem with the steam and dampness of the shower

It has a rubber base so you can take it out of the shower and set it on the counter and it won't vibrate off onto the floor.I'd say it's only flaws are that it's a little hard to identify the buttons because the whole thing is wrapped in a rubber casing

You get used to it though
Also, the charging cable they provide is very short.TIP: You CAN rewind and skip songs

Just hold down the volume up or down key to do it.I looked at several shower speakers and I'm glad I picked this one

Absolutely satisfied.

$REVIEW.: It's big, so read the product description carefully and make sure it will fit in your case.  If it will, don't hesitate. This thing works amazingly well.  As an engineer I can tell you that the heat taken out of the heatsink is proportional to the surface area exposed, and that's where this thing wins. The heat pipes move the heat to the extra large fins and the fins do there job to spread the heat so the fan can blow it away easily without having to spin faster and make a lot of noise. I can't hear this thing at all, ever.  This is a completely sealed system, with nothing to leak and no pumps to break, and it works just as well as any liquid cooled system, so I wouldn't bother with those.

$review_text.: The TM822G does the job, that's about the highest praise I can give a cable modem


 Lights are very large, bright and clearly labeled


 I love the fact that the AC adapter is integrated, so one fewer &#34;wall warts&#34; to squeeze in


 Looks to have very good ventilation, which is important for long-term reliability.My real surprise was the Comcast self-activation

 I replaced an old, leased triple-play modem with the TM822G ..
and thought of many ways this *could* go wrong: activate data but not voice, &#34;sorry, you already have a perfectly good modem, call for an appointment,&#34; etc
 All misplaced: self-activation was well-guided and smooth as possible and completed in half-an-hour
 I should have left the room rather than watching the &#34;progress bar&#34;, because the three or four modem reboots had me a tad concerned.Bottom line: the TM822G works as advertised, and kudos to Comcast for a very clean self-installation process


 Fingers crossed returning the leased modem to Comcast goes half as smoothly ...

$review_text.: Bought this after trying a Sigma Wide Angle Zoom, Simply put the Sigma was a great disappointment as it was unsharp though out the zoom range and on the edge and center of lens
 Due to Amazon's generous return policy, I returned it and decided to purchase the Nikkor for about $200 more.Now I know I am comparing apples to oranges but the Nikkor is superb


sharp edge to edge, top to bottom, side to side, wide open to stopped down

 The Sigma ( I own a number of great Sigma lenses)  was an assignment killer, where as the Nikkor has earned me numerous Kudos from clients

(  I am a professional photographer).If you purchase this lens....
be sure to look at "FISH-EYE HEMI" a software program that corrects some of the distortion in your images

 Photoshop has this capability and Nikon software can do this as well,  but for the $30 or so for this Photoshop Plug-In,  It's well worth it


It corrects curved lines well and has no problem correcting human faces in the images, even those on the edge.

$review_text.: The unit I received was dead on arrival.  The unit would power the drive, but the computer never saw anything connected to the USB bus.To be clear, I purchased 5 different units, to stock a compatibility lab where we test gear we build for the largest Telecom company (we are their largest supplier of consumer gateways).  So while I may not bean expert in all things, I am certainly competent in installing a hard drive in an external USB enclosure.  Of the 5 units I purchased, all would install drivers and configure themselves the moment you plug them in, and all would see the drives I was using (brand new Western Digital 320gb drives that were surplussed from samples of DVR's we had upgraded to larger drives).I'm inclined to believe that it was just a bad sample, that this DOA was simply a bad sample.  Based on the other reviews, only about 2% of the units are DOA.  I will return for replacement.Assuming the unit was operational, I really like the case design.  It has a nice rounded profile, and is likely to provide good drive cooling as long as you don't operate the drive in the soft vinyl pouch that came with it.  This is the only one I got that came with the pouch, and while that may seem like a plus, it might encourage people to run the unit in the pouch.  That is fine as long as your drive doesn't run warm.  Drives live longer cool.If the unit was working, the only negative would be the screw driver that came with it.  In another review a reviewer reports that the screws are fragile, and he saw metal shavings coming off from simply screwing them in...  He blamed the screws.  In fact, any time your screw driver is not the same size as the screws, this will happen.  The screw holes are simple holes in plastic, and the screws are tiny self-taping type, so the first time you put them in you must be careful.  A better screw driver with a larger blade would improve the performance of the screws.  The included driver appears to be around size #00, while my size #1 seems to be a better fit (my size measurements are based on my cheap Stanley set of precision drivers from Home Depot).  So the included screw driver does work, but it will try to strip the Phillips center of the screws if you don't handle it carefully.I will update the review once I have received a replacement.
$SUMMARY.: Dead on arrival!

$review_text.: I had zero problems with my Kingston 64GB SDCX card - plugged in and worked like a champ in all of my newer devices. For older devices, however - it's almost a crapshoot on whether or not the card will be recognized due to the file formatting. It is possible to reformat the card into an NTFS structure, note that you will lose some performance due to NTFS's required overhead (though it's not really a huge hit).When using my friends Canon 60D in burst mode as well as with full 1080p video, I saw little lag.  Shooting at RAW+JPG(L) (average 18mb raw, 5mb jpeg), I could burst around 10 shots before the camera slowed to write data.
$SUMMARY.: Great little card - make sure your device can read exFAT

$REVIEW.: When I purchased my Sony DSC-RX100 camera, I also purchased the Sony camera case

 The Sony case was $89.99

 While reviewing other camera accessories for my Sony DSC-RX100, I found the MegaGear Ever Ready Protective Brown Leather Camera Case


 I ordered it, and when it arrived I compared it to the Sony case

 There was no noticeable difference

 I returned the Sony case, and with the price difference I was able to purchase other accessories for my camera (battery charger, extra battery, and lens filter) all paid for the difference in savings from the Sony case


 I would highly recommend this case to any owner of the Sony DSC-RX100 camera

 You will not be disappointed
 Great product, well made


Looks good with the contrast between the black camera and brown case.

$REVIEW.: I am very cranky about buying something thin and light weight and then putting a protective wrapper around it that turns it into a heavy and fat thing.  I spent quite a bit of time reading reviews on various Ipad protectors before settling on this product.  I have been very pleased.Pros:The folding cover folds completely flat to the back and provides a fair stand when rolled up.The whole unit is reasonably solid so that I feel that my ipad is safe.No clunky frame that hides part of the front of the ipad and adds extra thickness.The whole thing snaps on easily and does not cover any important controls or orifices.The back has a slightly rubberised feel that makes it much easier to hold onto.The cover acts like the Apple version with a pleasant magnetic snap when closed.Cons:The cover DOES NOT detach like the apple cover, but I don't really miss that.The back shows a little oily finger prints, but they wipe off easily.Overall, I would recommend to my friends.
$SUMMARY.: Very Nice Fit on Ipad Air
 Not too bulky.

$review_text.: update 2/4/2013.  The battery performance is really poor. Today, i charged it to 100%, used it for about 30 minutes and then let it sleep for three hours.  After using it for another ~ 30 minutes it died.  I only surfed websites, no video or graphic intensive sites were visited. Brightness was set to ~ 70% and keypad backlit was on.  The video card performance is again quite inadequate. other than those issues, no breakdowns or problems.**************************************************My wife gave me a 13 inch Mac air a month ago.  After playing with it for a month, i have to say, it is a good machine with lots of shortcomings.  To use a car analogy, i would compare it to the Honda S2000; lots of fun, reliable, beautiful piece of sculpture,  but a bit low on oomph.I will quickly summarize the pro's and con's.Pro-1.  Slick designSturdy construction2.  Light weight3.  Speedy processor for light duty work4.  Intuitive integration of software.5.  Keyboard with back lighting6.  Still the best ultrabook available, but that is about to change in less than a year with several new entries into the segment.7.  Apps available.8.  Individual keys for volume and brightness control.  This allow simple and quick changes.9.  Probably the best and most important feature of the laptop is the bright and high resolution screen.  It makes reading 10X easier and more comfortable.10. Stable OS11. Supposedly pretty much virus free. Unfortunately, i can't say the same with window systems.12. No moving parts to break down except the cooling fan which comes on only rarely.13. Trackpad- more useful than just the good old track pads, but function is a bit unreliable and takes some training.Cons-1.  Battery life is no where close to the claimed > 7 hours, unless you turn off Wifi, set at very dim level and do not run video. For routine use, 3 hours is more like it.2.  The fonts are small and not always easy to increase in size. somewhat limited customization options.3.  Slow video processor.  Most Youtube or internet video will play fine, but some will not play well or at all.  I have compared it side by side with my HP Envy and the Mac appears disabled compared to the Envy. Very limited graphic memory and not upgradable.4.  Keyboard feels flimsy.  This is subjective, but i feel that the HP envy keypads provide more feedback..6.  High initial cost of entry.7.  Mac OS- this is subjective and controversial obviously, but i find Window 7 easier to use with more customization options.8.  Windows 7 still by far has more compatible accessories and software. There are software that allow dual OS or cross compatibility, but most of them will slow down your computer and they are not necessarily cheap.9.  No USB 3.010. The power off button is one of the keys on the keyboard next to Delete and Volume control which means inadvertent power off is not infrequent unless you pay attention to it.11. Unreliable trackpad-  beautiful engineering when it works, but is often unreliable and inconsistent.  I use my good old mouse every chance i can get.To summarize, it is probably still the best Ultrabook available, but probably not for long. You will like it if you absolutely have to have a Mac ultrabook or you cannot wait another 6 months for better competing models from the PC camp.  If don't care for the Mac OS and you can wait for another few months, then i would go for Window 8 Ultrabooks which will likely be available sometime next year. Better yet, if you don't really need an ultrabook, get a real computer.

$review_text.: The case is an excellent purchase I have made, for $3 I was getting the same protection or even better than those cases that are $30. The one problem I had with it is the headphone jack is too small, my headphone wouldn't fit. What I did was cut a little part of the rub surrounding headphone jack ( dot worry it still works and I'm not saying you should do it) anyways, I'm happy with it.

$REVIEW.: I bought this TV in Canada in January of 2006, mostly to watch the Winter Olympics and then later the 2006 World Cup.  Paid about $1000 as I recall.  In hind sight, I wish I could have waited a year....because that would have landed me a *lighter-weight* TV for the same price.  In early 2006, the LCD TV's just didn't look that great (to me at least) and the plasma TV's were still all north of $1300.Plus, the extra weight makes it a pain when it comes to moving....and I've moved twice with it (500+ miles both times).  The first time, I still had the original box.  The last time, I just rapped it up tight in bubble wrap and card board.  Everything is still clicking as good as day one.High-def has always been sharp.  720 and 1080 Xbox360 games all look great.  I don't have Blu-Ray, so I can't comment on that.  But normal high-def cable TV (Time Warner) looks fine.Only real negative about this TV is its weight....but I hardly think you can really dock it too much for that.  Because tube televisions were ALL beasts, so it just goes with the territory.

$review_text.: Throw away or keep as an extra backup set the rechargeable batteries that come with the camera. The included batteries have only 2000-2100 ma's of power. You will get much better performance and longer life using the Immedion 2400ma Rechargeable's.. They work great with this camera and they make a big difference over using the weaker 2000ma variety. Do not use Powerex Heavy Duty batteries.. they will not work. The tip on the plus end of the battery must be of the smaller diameter variety.. the wider ended tips simply will not work in this camera.A bad design flaw, as It would be great to use 2800ma batteries or the choice to use any AA battery not just the narrow tipped ones. There may be other high ma rechargeable brands out there that have the smaller + tip end.. I just dont know without visual inspection seeing them which ones will work or not.

$review_text.: Before I go into this review, this is an important note: As of this writing, you cannot use these headphones wirelessly, as you need to connect to the PS4 via the supplied 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable.  This is an issue on the Sony side, and a patch is expected. Of course, that defeats the point of wireless, but it is an option.  With that said:These have really nice sound and put you in the action audio-wise when you are playing COD or anything else.  You get immersed in the surround sound, and because you have a headset on, you aren&#8217;t driving those around you crazy.These are marketed as being for PS4, but you can certainly use them for PS3 or Xbox as well.So, what&#8217;s in the box?&#8226; PX4 headphones&#8226; PX4 Wireless Transmitter&#8226; Detachable &#8220;boom&#8221; microphone&#8226; Digital Optic cable&#8226; USB charging cable&#8226; 2.5mm adapter cable (adapters to 3.5mm)&#8226; Xbox 360 chat cable&#8226; Quick Start Guide&#8226; Turtle Beach stickerSet up is simple, charge &#8216;em up and go!  The controls are easy to learn.  The left ear cup has the Power Button, Tone, &#8220;Blast Limiter&#8221;, Mic monitor, Xbox jack, Game Volume, and the mic port.  The right side houses the Bluetooth/Chat Volume, Bluetooth LED and control button, the mic mute, and the charging port/LED.The Bluetooth works well, and you can jump in to answer a phone call and go back to playing, etc.  Pairing is simple, like any other Bluetoooth device.  Note: if you use these on Xbox, you must use a cable to connect.  Based on your Xbox version, the connection may vary.  The Ear Force user manual covers this in detail with diagrams, etc.  You should not need to buy any extra cables, using what is included in the box.I also like the detachable microphone, since I tend not to use one, so I like to take it off.They are very comfortable, even after an hour or two of wearing them.  The padding seems to be of nice quality, and they feel light on your head.Blast Limiter is a nice feature if you tend to play with the volume turned way up, as it will limit the spike in volume for explosions and other very loud, sudden game sounds.My favorite feature, because I always like to customize/play with sound is the &#8220;virtual positioning.&#8221;  You can use this to adjust the surround sound.  So, for example you might want your front channels set for 30 degrees and rear for 105, or maybe 60 degrees in front and 150 in the rear for a more &#8220;front/back&#8221; audio experience.  There are 6 preset variations; you cannot customize these beyond the 6 settings.As for power, the headsets put out 27mW per channel, THD &#60;1%.  The speakers are 50mm with neodymium magnets.  The frequency response is advertised as 20Hz - 20kHz, &#60; 120dB.Battery life is great.  I get about 14 hours or so of continue use off the Li-Ion battery.  The system will power off after 5 minutes without a signal to save battery life.  You can also play while you charge by plugging it in while you are playing. The USB cable charges only.  It does not connect the headset to other devices for audio use.Overall, great sound and performance, good price &#8211; not much to dislike about the PX4.  In the end, there are other options, some cost somewhat less and everyone has their own likes and dislikes.  I think these deliver excellent sound and the audio experience in a game is very life-like.  If they were a little less expensive I'd rate them a 5, but in general they are really nice.

$review_text.: It has much lower latency than WIFI, and requires no setup if you don't use encryption (a moca filter keeps this secure in a house)
 I just connected to cable line, plugged it in and it worked


 It connected with the Motorola AC/MOCA router and got full speed immediately.The picture is incorrect, in that it only had one port, and you have to use included splitter (and purchase another MOCA filter)

For my setup, where I don't have a TV at that point, this gives a stronger signal (two port has internal splitter)
 But not as clean if you do have TV there.

$REVIEW.: I have used perhaps a dozen headphones/earphones over the years. These are the best I've used. They are expensive and I would feel the need to use them only in "easy use" environments...I do not think I can say that these are a full ten times better than a nice 20 dollar pair... but they are clearly better. First, they are packaged very securely... cut the clear tape to open the end and slide the contents out. The zippered clam-shell case included has a small "cup" within it...the glue attaching it had failed so it was loose within the case... this is a minor detail and we hope not any indication of the level of care used in producing the headphones themselves. Within the case are some extra ear foams and a small cleaning tool and an adapter plug. There is also a mic/control line with short cut buttons... which I also found useful as an extension for plugging into a desk top computer. The sound is natural and crisp across all frequencies. Even high dynamic range recordings were clear. The noise isolation is superior... I didn't hear the phone ring at all from a few feet away... she had to leave a message! So don't use these where that would be a danger... driving or jogging say. The headphones are ergonomically designed... made for the anatomy of the ear... the external ear canal proceeds inward and forward and these accommodate that... so always put the right side in the right ear, etc. for the proper fit. You will have to learn the control buttons for each application from the users guide. The mic works fine and phone calls were crystal clear. So, if you have the money... these may be the right choice! I can certainly say these are great headphones!

$review_text.: Debated between AVIC700 and 900 and ultimately decided on AVIC-F700BT. I have about 17 movies already on my IPOD (gotta love MP4 and Digital Copy) and did NOT want to carry around ANY DVD's in my collection due to bad memories of damaged CD's. Also didnt need MSN Direct. So W/ AVIC700BT being $200 cheaper (on Amazon) than 900 - 700 was clear winner. Self-Installed entire new sound  system in my 01 Maxima starting w/ AVIC700. Lucked out and found a double-din dash kit locally that completely matched my Maxima interior. Fit n'Finish is good: A- grade. Only mod done was Parking break HARDWARE mod (didn't want to brick this using any shady software mod). This thing is cool! It has bugs yes (some very annoying) but overall FABULOUS product for price.POSITIVES:1.MOVIE PLAYBACK IS AWESOME THRU IPOD & AVIC! Sound and picture darn good for being in the vehicle! Matrix Reloaded, Mr&Mrs; Smith, Vanilla Sky all looked and sounded great on 5.8" screen and system.2.Runs on Windows for doing MODs!3.The Voice recognition works better than expected. Recognizes most artists I request: Play artist...Metallica, Alice In Chains (funny hearing the female voice saying this back), Slayer, Green Day, Ice Cube, heck even Hootie & The Blowfish requested and played successfully!4. EQ in the unit is great. Also has Loudness and Source Level Adjust for tweaking music to perfect - got rid of some vehicle rattles and speaker distortion by fine tuning the AVIC.5. Bluetooth works surprisingly good. Some callers say it sounds better than motorola bluetooth earpiece! Sound on my end is so/so. Still experimenting with this B/T and phone contacts transfer. Touchscreen dialpad very cool!6.GPS works pretty good but haven't used it on a road trip or to find a needed location yet. Played around and it got me to my offc ok.7. Music search using touchscreen is FASSST! Find what you want in seconds using the touch screen without going thru entire IPOD library (previously used Sony CDXGT-610UI and Pioneer Pioneer DEH-P4000).8. On future road trips I'm gonna connect a PS2 slim thru the front AUX port and using RCA to 3.5mm jack and play video games on the screen(fiance driving of course).NEGATIVES:1. What's up w/ the having to disconnect/reconnect IPOD everytime I start the vehicle? This to ME is the most annoying. Searched AVIC411.com for a solution - didn't find anything. Once in awhile there's no problem but usually I have to disconnect and reconnect IPOD.2. NO REMOTE!!!!!! I've used both wireless remote and steering controls and wireless remote hands down best option for convenience and safety. Better than steering wheel control in my opinion. I've had to get used to touching the screen to do anything. Researched all over online and couldn't find a wireless remote I could use with AVIC700. Relegated to using the PAC SWI-PS & steering controls for BASIC functions: volume&track; search - it's "aight".3. Start up time I doesn't really bother me so not a big issue. I always just pray for a blessed trip during this "moment of silence" anyway.The bugs are minor and for the price - it's a fantastic unit! Brand new, incl 1yr warranty for [...] Shipping thru Amazon/BarneysElectronics - CAN'T BEAT THAT WITH A STICK!!01 Maxima SE, AVICF700BT, Pionner 6.75(front)/5.25(rear) components, 10" Kicker Comp Sub in sealed enclosure(trunk), 2 Sony 600W 4Ch amps, Dynamat trunk kit.

$REVIEW.: I love this lens. It's quite a bit heavier than any of my other lenses and that does take some getting used to. I highly recommend this lens if you're looking for a higher quality lens with minimal zoom. I've been shooting with a 50mm lens and finally grew tired of the restrictions that lens puts on me and my pictures. This lens is great because it zooms out and in without going too far or not far enough. I just used it to shoot a wedding a few weeks ago and was able to leave this lens on my camera the entire time. I bought this lens refurbished and I was a little wary about that but it is Canon refurb and works like a charm (just a few hundred dollars less!). Can't wait to practice more and fall a little more in love with this lens and its possibilities!

This was a great solution to three things I wanted to accomplish: charge the iPod; hold the iPod at a good viewing (and touching) angle; and listen to music. There is a small piece of rubber that supports the back of the iPod while it is in the dock, which allays my concern that all that inputting might put stress on the connector. (I don't know how, or if, other docks address this.) The case it comes with is very nice, maybe too nice -- now I want to take my iPod everywhere and make some noise!

$REVIEW.: I don't have one of these extenders however after 25 years working for 3COM, HP, and Cisco Systems etc. I do understand how they work.Firstly you need to understand how a typical home is wired for electrical power. Most homes receive a 240 volt power feed from the electrical supplier, the 240 volt supply is actually 2 120 volt circuits that come from a center tapped transformer. There are 2 hot wires and a neutral wire, part of the house is wired from the neutral wire and one of the 120 volt wires the rest of the house uses the same neutral wire and the OTHER 120 volt wire.All power outlets fed from the same 120 volt wire provide a simple data path between themselves so that if the data extender boxes are plugged into these power outlets there is a good chance that they will connect. If one extender is plugged into the first 120 volt wire and the other data extender is plugged into an outlet wired to the second 120 volt wire things are slightly different. Data from one extender can only get to the other extender by flowing along the power line to the local electrical company transformer passing through the transformer windings to the other 120 volt wire and back to your house and to the second extender box. All kinds of ugly things can happen if your data follows this excursion, electrical companies are not concerned with the electrical cleanliness of their equipment. All kinds of RF interference may be encountered along the way which will play havoc with power line data transmission.What is to be done? firstly ensure that each extender box is on the same 120 volt circuit, if you don't know anything about electricity then you may need the services of an electrician. There is however a fairly simple fix, it is possible to BRIDGE the 2 120 volt circuits together so that high frequency data signals can jump from one 120 volt line to the other without travelling outside to the company xformer. Again I strongly advise that you contact an electrical engineer to do this, placing a capacitor between the 2 electrical feeds in your household distribution panel will provide a pathway for the high frequency data signals while still blocking the electrical power itself.As for all the other IP address problems etc. I usually find that these problems are caused by the user because they do not have the requisite understanding of how networking works. One complainer said he was a very savvy user because he could re-load operating systems if he had good instructions!!!!!!!!!!!Some complained that they were getting "duplicate IP address warnings" that means that you have "duplicate IP addresses in your network" it can't be much plainer than that. Somehow YOU have introduced the problem and it may seem that the network devices are all plotting  against you but I can assure you that they are NOT. It takes some detective work to find the problem and it can be frustrating that's why I got paid the big bucks at HP, 3COM and Cisco.Sometimes there are genuine hardware problems and sometimes there are some very bad household devices that generate lots of electrical NOISE on the household wiring. I once worked for an entire weekend at a very large hotel complex trying to find out why network connections kept on dropping. It turned out to be a batch of brand new Panasonic phones, when we removed these phones and installed phones from a different batch of identical devices ALL THE CONNECTION PROBLEMS CEASED.I have found that even the best equipment can produce horrific RF interference, you see manufacturers of domestic appliances DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE INTERFERENCE THEY PRODUCE because most of the time this interference goes unnoticed.Good luck but if you do NOT understand how networking works don't blame the equipment.
$review_summary.: If you don't understand how these devices work you will have trouble.

$review_text.: Although it does the job it has MAJOR flaws and not as nice as my $150 Nook HD+


 For one, Windows 8.1 is just the "worst of both worlds" for lack a better description

 If you use it as a tablet "Windows Metro" has VERY LIMITED app selection, while Android and Apple IOS has thousands of apps
 I have to use Google Chrome because of IE (Internet Explorer) security risks/flaws, which means I have to use traditional windows because its NOT available for Metro tablet environment
 Using traditional windows on a tablet is a horrible experience


 I would feel the same trying to use Apples desktop OS-X on an ipad, rather than tablet optimized IOS.Other issues:The thing is heavier than the first generation Ipad, which is surprising because that is what Steve Balmer (CEO of Microsoft) complained about when he first held an ipad saying "it was heavier than his laptop."Also the camera quality is not good, considering this thing is over $1000 (most expensive tablet you can buy) is should have the best camera available.Also it gets very hot in the upper left corner so be careful where you touch it.In my opinion you have to be crazy nuts spend big money on this

 Google Docs is nicer than Office so Microsoft's ad to "get real work done" is a joke

 I can get more work done using Android or IOS


 Since I started using Google Docs spreadsheet work is much easier, and I have not ever lost a document like I would every time office crashed on me.In my opinion the Surface Pro 2 worth about half that of an Ipad
 I advise to stick with a main stream Ipad or Android

 I have recently read that many developers are not making Metro apps because they see it as a dead product

 Resale value on this cannot be good either

 For every one of these sold I think Microsoft put twice that in advertising.It boils down to standard windows is horrible experience on tablet


 The Metro tablet interface part of this sorry (even though I thought it looked cool at first) and has very few apps (less than the Blackberry Playbook)
 Call me a weak old man but its too heavy to hold in your hand.The people giving this high reviews are just trying to get other people to buy into it especially after they are $1000+ into it.

You will not be disappointed


The part i was most excited about was the sub woofer since i like R&B; or, rap

The bass is for sure powerful and has great low sound that can rattle the walls
But for those of you who aren't to big with bass, there is a nice bass control on the volume pod.Pros- Easy setup- Amazing sound- Crazy slick look- Great Bass- Sturdy structureCons- A lot of wires

WOW!!! there is tons of room and lots of pockets for stashing other items in this bag


Like, my charger, extra batteries, lens caps, cables, manuals
It was so big just for my XTI that I also put my Canon AE1 with extra lens in it and, I still have a lot of storage space left

I'm new to the SLR stuff so perhaps when I get more equipment I will want another bag just for it but, for now I'm glad I didnt buy anything bigger.This really is a fairly big bag


I thought I read a review that said they wished it had straps for a tripod, It does

I wasnt expecting anything even close to being this nice and roomy for $40.00

$REVIEW.: I tried to post a of bacteria and yeast that I made with this microscope but the upload froze at the end.  Perhaps it froze due toconfusing Amazon by having no sound track?I'll take this cheap, but new and properly calibrated microscope over the super expensive but abused and poorly calibrated microscopes at the college any day.  When the college microscopes are properly calibrated (as in when you find a lab aide and have them adjust it on the spot) they might offer a clearer view than this.  But most of the time the expensive college microscopes are trashed and you can't see much with them in spite of all the expensive optics.  I kind of dread going to the college microscopy lab now, because I never know what condition my microscope there will be in.I have been using my omax scope for looking at moss.  I am very happy with it.  It has an adjustment knob for condenser and a diaphram that I can see to focus on the edges with.  It does not do dark phase, but I'm not sure what I'm missing with that. Some people find a way to get these types of scopes to do dark phase by putting something in the filter holder.  I wish I knew how to do that.  The biggest complaint I have is that it did not come with an eyepiece reticle and I had to order a different occular to get the eyepiece reticle.I tested the lenses with a slide micromenter after I bought an occular with an eyepiece reticle, and found they were exactly the same as the college scopes.. to convert to micrometers at 4X multiply by 25, at 10X mulitply by 10, at 40x multiply by 2.5 and the oil emmersion lens requires no multiplication.  I'm not sure what the multiplication would be for the x20 occulars and x2000 magnification as I did not purchase one of those with a reticule.  I'm sure that someone who is good at math could figure it out for me. (hint)I've been using this microscope about every other day for the last 4 months.  I use it to look at moss leaves. I've gotten some great pictures with the camera but I had to learn to adjust the focus for the computer monitor and not for the eyepeices.  The focus for the USB camera seems to be set for 100X magnifacation.  The camera has a small width of view than the occulars, I can get around this by stitching images together so I can get a picture of a whole moss leaf even if it is a big leaf.  But it takes photoshop for me to to a good autostitch.The manual for the camera software is written in very poor Chinese to English.  I can not understand it.  I can use the software to measure things but I find that I have to calibrate it with the eyepiece reticle each time I use it.  The software does not save your values, you must load a file with your values but the values do not seem constant.  So when I want to measure stuff I measure stuff I calibrate the software with the eyepiece reticle each time.  After that I can capture and image and make multiple measurements with ease.  The camera software is not very powerful, for exaple, it will not do time lapse photos and the text it puts on measured items is way too small.  I see no way to change the text size.  Still I'm very happy that I got this microscope with a camera so I can share all my images and videos and for clearer viewing with the x20 occulars.The hexagonal diaphram thingy is not a perfect hexogon anymore and I don't know if that is a problem or how to adjust it.  The stage scrolls smoothly but has slightly more friction than the college microscope stages.I am very happy with this microscope and am glad I did not pay thousands of dollars for a name brand scope.Update, I have now been using this microscope for 8 months.  It is still working great.  The lightbulb did burn out once, so I replaced it with the extra bulb that came with it.At first I found the x20 occulars to be worthless, becasue the glass is so small, (the field of view is the same I think) but now I have learned to use my PC and the built in camera to view things using those occulars.  The camera actually gets a better image then my eyes do at x2000.  At x2000 I can see bacteria swimming around!I'm beginning to think that name brand microscopes are way overpriced!

$review_text.: We use this in my wife's Passat, and find that it does slide around a bit (not much but noticeable). We find that she needs to &#34;re-adjust&#34; its position after almost every daily trip to and from work. Obviously does not &#34;grip&#34; the dashboard as well as other products. If it came with either better &#34;gripping&#34; rubber on the underside, or more weight or had some other way to stay put, this would earn 5 stars for me.

$REVIEW.: I bought this lens originally for my XTi five or six years ago.It was my work horse for most of what I was doing, sharing the bag with a tele zoom for candid portraits.It is quite soft at 17mm when shooting all open (nothing dramatic unless you spend your time shooting test patterns).The IS works just fine, the lens is really silent; the build is very strong, but...I did get the Er01 after 3 and a half years of using it.I live in Costa Rica and it took three weeks to get the replacement part.It turns out that the problem is with a ribbon cable wearing out - there is no way to avoid it as soon as you zoom in and out and if you use your lens as I do (i.e
a lot) then it WILL fail you.I ended up having to borrow a crappy lens to cover the wedding of a friend - fortunately there was also a pro covering his wedding, so he dealt with the wide angle shots and I dealt with the tele zoom portraits and all went well.At the time I write this review, one of the competitors for the 17-85 is the recentEF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UDalso provided as a kit lens for the EOS 60D and the EOS 7D, which is why I got my hands on it.This newer lens has a similar image quality (somewhat better to me, at least) and so they are comparable:In favor of the EFS 18-135 ISOpens a little more: f/3.5@18mm & f/5.6 @ 135mm vs


f/4@17mm &f;/5.6@85mm, which makes a difference in portrait or low-light conditions.Has a longer focal range - I don't miss the 17mm to 18mm difference that much, yet the 85mm to 135mm does make a difference at the other end.Nearly half the price.In favor of the EFS 17-85 IS USMIt's more silent (USM oblige) - Please note that this can be a deal maker for those who use autofocus when shooting video.It has a focus distance window (not that I use it nearly ever).Focus can be adjusted without switching to manual focus on the lens thanks to the USM.The focus ring feels better when using it in manual.It is slightly more compact, especially when at 85mm vs 135mm for the other lens (duh).Stronger build - but with this annoying Er01 / ribbon cable problem (but I don't know if the 18-165 will exhibit a similar issue)All in all if you intend to use mostly autofocus I would choose the 18-135 over the 17-85.Actually I own both so the price does not factor in my choice, and I choose the 18-135 over the 17-85.I will keep it because its resale value is lower than its usage value as a second backup lens, but I would not buy it now.I hope this helps.

$REVIEW.: Let me just say I bought two of these and both are incredible


 They make some, but very discreet noise you can't even hear over your videos/games (I bought this as a gamer)
 The reason I'm so happy is my old stock fans that came w/ my pc did not push air, they 'suggested' it go in a direction

 It was frustrating as it would get super hot


 These fans literally push air through the case

 You can feel the cool breeze when holding your hand over the airflow (my old fans I'd always question which direction the air flow was going...)
 The blue LED looks badass with my blue LED PSU and new case!  I am very happy (:  I just hope they remain this way, as I've only owned them for about a week as of this review writng.

$REVIEW.: I'm used to sporting cheap ear buds like skull candy ink'd, etc.  So my appreciation for sound may not be at the same level of a audiophile.  These buds definitely sounded better than my budget buds.  The manufacture is much better, with a reinforced split "Y".  The unique feature of these, to secure them in your ears for exercise or sports, is a flexible adjustable hook that hooks forward into the front edge of your ear.  Amazingly enough, this works very well to secure the buds.For long wear I noticed that there was a little rub due to the hook that I'm not accustomed to, and that may prevent long wear.  These are definitely not buds to fall asleep in either - they will be uncomfortable to rest on.  Even with these cons, these are excellent sport buds and I wear them often.  After 2 months of use, they have not shown any breakage at the connections, "y" or buds.
$review_summary.: Sound quality is good.  Slightly uncomfortable for long wear.

$review_text.: I have had this charger for about 6 years.This is a fast charger

It has charged my batteries in 15-20 minutes


At least thats how long the charge would last until it said it was done.This is what this charger is intended to do, BUT...Charging batteries this fast is NOT good for the batteries.I was only getting about 7-10 photos with my camera before it was saying that the batteries were dead

I was blaming the camera for this, thinking there was a short or something.Turns out that it is NOT the camera but the charger

These batteries need longer charge times to cycle properly
They will eventually burn out the batteries.This charger is only good if you absolutly need somewhat charged batteries in a hurry.Otherwise get a longer charging system.

$SUMMARY.: Fast Charger but not Good

$review_text.: One downside to shooting Sony gear is their pathological obsession with insisting on proprietary flash mounts, and I am sooooo looking forward to the standardized shoes they've started using on the new models
 That said, I have a lot of shots to do with my a77 before I can plunk down another 3 large on a 99, and apparently I was one of the lucky last round buyers of the minolta legacy mount
 Yay.My Sony flashes work fine - with or without this unit, but I had to get it to be able to use my YN flashes when it's not possible to maintain line of sight to trigger them

 It works, but (again due to Sony's OCD) nobody makes an RF603 or 604 transmitter that will work on a Sony, so I needed these to MacGuyver a group beyond 3 strobes even though the flashes have receivers built in.It's OK - I'd rather spend 30 on these than 400 more per flash for more Sony heads, but it's not as handy, and just increase clutter and complexity - which I definitely don't need, and I'm cheap - I hate wasting the recievers the flashes already have.Whining aside, they work great - work every time - and the price is right for sure

 The transmitter can be a bear to get fully seated, but if you have the remote strobe attached to the receiver and turned on, it will confirm with a quick flash when you get it in there - nice touch

 Plastic attachment points, but you'd have to expect that at this price.


$SUMMARY.: Get the job done

$REVIEW.: You are getting what you pay for. It is not that cheap but it is not expensive either. It looks somewhat cheap in comparison with "L" type lens below, but it is not bad at all.Good thing is that it is possible to use different batteries, but word of caution: I purchased ACD-270 battery with is supposed to replace SONY NP-FM55H and while it connects quite well, it provides the light for a less than 50 minutes only and I expect it to become worse, so it is pretty useless.Recheargeable AAA batteries are working for more than 90 minutes before the light starts to fade. Battery indicator is not very useful.Overall, I am happy with my purchase. If the budget is tight, consider cheaper models like Opteka VL-126 Ultra High Power 126 LED.

Next, we tested it by playing songs that had equal amounts of bass and treble


I was impressed with both! I haven't even tried it with my iPhone yet, but there is no doubt I will be impressed there too
The small portable size and calaspable feature make it very convenient and portable

$REVIEW.: I attached this strap to a Nikon AW100 underwater camera. I actually prefer this strap to the "out of the box" strap my camera comes with that doesn't float, even while I'm out of the water. I first tested throwing my camera into a pool at the hotel and the camera itself dangles like it wants to sink, but this Nikon strap keeps it afloat - only the tippy top of the strap bobbles in the water. Next day we went sailing in the Adriatic Sea and of course I yell "pass me my camera" to someone on deck and someone with poor throwing skills flung my camera into the water far from where I was swimming. I looked and prayed - yes the floating strap did its job (even in sea water) and it was floating around in the water waiting for me to swim to it. Also, I let my friend take pictures in a pool party full of about 5000 people and she didn't realize there was a button at the bottom of the strap to make it more secure on her wrist. It slipped off her wrist but she found it floating along not too far from her.It's a great strap it survived 9 days of sailing, swimming, and some pool water in Croatia! Because my camera is so rugged, I have been treating my camera like crap so the strap has been through a lot! I have had no problems. Do note it takes awhile to dry but it's cloth/foam material which feels nice on the wrist. It is a bit bulky when carrying around out of the water or in your bag..again, totally worth it if you have an underwater camera. No regrets buying this. It is totally worth it if you don't want your camera or device at the bottom of the ocean, pool, or lake.

The picture is even better on non-high-def channels than my old Samsung 24 inch LCD that this one replaced. The viewing angles are better, too. It's amazing how picture quality has gone up in the last few years while prices have gone down. Like others have said, the remote has few features, but I use my Directv remote for most functions anyway.

$review_text.: Summary: Fantastic 5-star NAS with a few small bugs in the apps (drops rating down to 4).I am an IT professional that has used NAS storage for home network for about 18 years.  I've had DLink, Netgear (ReadyNAS DUO) ZyXel and LaCIE.  I've been using this system now for a year with no interruptions or failures.  For the money, you will have to pry this system out of my cold hard hands.  I think that I may need a second one - but, maybe I'll look at the DS412+.Setup was a breeze.  But, I've worked with enough different systems that I didn't need to look at the documentation and I didn't use their setup wizard.  I haven't had need to seek any technical support.  For the price you're paying for this device, anyone that is expecting top-notch technical support has misplaced expectations.  It is solid hardware with a bunch of built-in useful applications.I'm using this it as (a) network storage for my XMBC media center, (b) to manage my IP security camera, (c) stream music to my Logitech SqueezeBox and (d) general NAS storage.  Speed has been very acceptable (using all of these functions concurrently); but the DS412+ would give me an extra boost.One area it lacks is in advanced security.  Even though this comes with VPN capabilities, I do not consider this device suitable for being internet facing on a home DMZ.  I would not use it to create a personal cloud.

$REVIEW.: To say that Corsair's entry into the gaming headset market started out with a boom, would be an understatement
More widely known for their high-end PC components, Corsair began their invasion into the gaming audio market with the Gaming Audio Series HS1 USB Gaming Headset
Several months later, in a move that appears to have been made to appease high-end audio card users, Corsair released the HS1A Analog Headset

I'll go over both Corsair gaming headsets in this review.PROS:- Super comfortable- Great sound quality- User-replaceable ear pads- Long, tangle-proof cable- Great value- Good mic- 2 year warrantyCONS:- Lacks some bass- A bit heavyCOMFORTI spend a great deal of time with headphones on, whether I'm listening to music while writing reviews, watching movies on Netflix, or playing games

Not only do headphones provide a better listening experience, but they also allow me to enjoy all those activities at night, when my family is asleep

Therefore, comfort, is the most important characteristic for me


My head size is probably slightly smaller than average so if a pair of headphones are really tight on my head, chances are, they'll be really tight on an average person

My favorite pair of headphones, by far, is the Sennheiser HD 555's

They're better for music than movies or gaming, but I've yet to find another pair of headphones or headsets that match their comfort
That is, until I slipped on the Corsair HS1/HS1A

Their memory foam ear pads are like pillows over my ears
I spent hours listening to them with very little discomfort

The large ear cups easily surrounded my ears


The padding on the headband are nice and cushy and the headset did not grip my head like a vise


In fact, they were slightly loose


If you've ever tried on a pair of Sennheiser HD 280 Pro headphones, the Corsair HS1/HS1A's in comparison will feel like you aren't wearing anything at all


The only problem I had in regards to comfort was that they would occasionally slide around my head a bit whenever I looked up or down, due to the weight and loose grip

Regardless, believe me when I say that with the HS1/HS1A, you no longer have to sacrifice comfort for sound quality.SOUND QUALITYI found both the HS1 and HS1A to have very good sound quality for the price


It won't replace my HD 555's or Etymotic ER-4PT's for accuracy, but the HS1/HS1A's are more versatile and cost loads less


In stereo, both the HS1 and HS1A sounded very good, with forward vocals and clear highs
It did lack some bass though, so bass-heads should move along
Even adjusting the EQ didn't help much with the bass

On the HS1A, changing out the ear pads to the synthetic leather ones seemed to help a little bit just by way of creating a better seal

Of course, the HS1's only come with the memory foam ear pads so there's no help there

For music, I tested both headsets with FLAC audio files, Pandora streaming audio and LAME VBR MP3 files.I tested movies with Netflix streaming and DVDs


The HS1 sounded great with Dolby Headphone 5.1 surround sound (supports 7.1 as well)
I was able to make the analog HS1A sound just a good by using my Asus Xonar DX soundcard, which provides Dolby Headphone support on the card itself

I really appreciated the clear dialogue in the films I watched

Sound effects were great and directional effects were spot on

Again, due to the lack of bass, some of the more bassy explosion-type effects didn't come through as well, but I only noticed because I was listening for them critically.Playing F.E.A.R

2 with the HS1/HS1A gave me nightmares two nights in a row
No, seriously; they were really bad nightmares


With Dolby Headphone on, the directional effects gave me some serious goose bumps
The HS1/HS1A also reproduced the gunfire terrifically
I could clearly hear the bullet shells hitting the ground

StarCraft 2 was also a joy to play.The only real issue I had with sound was with volume on the analog HS1A

Though the HS1 and HS1A have identical sound specs, my Asus Xonar DX could not drive the HS1A's as well as I expected them to

I got them pretty loud, but there were times I wished I could get another 15-20% more

A higher end card with a better headphone amp may have done better.MICI had no problems with the mic on the HS1/HS1A at all

I tested it primarily with Skype and with some audio dubbing of video projects

I could hear some slight background noise in my recordings, but certainly passable for my purposes and for gaming


I appreciated that the mic folded out of the way when I didn't need it.BUILD & DESIGNBoth the HS1 and HS1A use 50mm drivers, which are bigger than the norm and probably contributed to the slightly heavy build
The entire headset is made out of plastic, less the headband


The headband is cushioned well and is covered in a soft, synthetic leather material


The single-sided cord is on the left ear cup and is about 10 feet in length

It is braided to prevent tangles and includes an attached velcro cable wrap


Both headsets have a wired remote about a third of the way down the cable from the ear cup

The HS1's remote is very cool

You can control the volume via separate volume up and volume down buttons
There is also a mic mute button and the volume buttons are surrounded by blue lights

At night, it makes it very easy to find

When you activate the mic mute, the light switches to red
The HS1A has a standard fare volume dial and mic mute switch


Other than the remote and difference in cable ends (USB vs

3.5mm jack), the only way to tell the difference between the HS1 and HS1A is the color of the ear cups


The HS1 ear cups are silver and the HS1A ear cups are black
I found the overall build quality of the HS1/HS1A to be very good--typical of Corsair

They even warranty the headsets for 2 years for good measure.HS1 or HS1A?I personally prefer the HS1 because of the built-in Dolby Headphone support
The built-in sound card essentially guarantees me consistent sound quality across any Windows PC


It's slightly more expensive than the HS1A but by less than $20 at most retailers


Also, my Asus Xonar DX soundcard doesn't autodetect headphones and requires me to select my output manually


This is a pain, but by using the USB HS1, I can just unplug it to listen to my speakers or plug the HS1 back in to listen to the headset


I recommend the analog HS1A to those users who have invested heavily in their PC sound with high-end audio cards like the Xonar Essence, that have outstanding headphone amps and have Dolby Headphone support on the card itself


If I'd spent $300 on an audio card, I'd probably want to use them too


It makes sense that Corsair answered the call of enthusiast consumers by releasing the HS1A
Woo!CONCLUSIONThe Corsair HS1 and HS1A gaming headsets are terrific buys


They have an incredible balance of comfort and sound quality


For everyday music listening, movie watching and gaming, I can't imagine a better headset to own
Audio enthusiasts who invested in high-end sound cards will appreciate the analog HS1A


Everyone else will enjoy the versatility and consistent sound quality of the HS1.* Review units courtesy of Corsair


$SUMMARY.: Great Balance of Comfort and Sound Quality (HS1 vs HS1A)

$review_text.: A heck of a lot better than the straight connectors.  It does not snag on things (I use it on my laptop) like straight connectors do.  The only downside that I have found is that because of its angle, it may cover other accessory outlets on your device.  It would be better if it swiveled or came in a right or left angle rather than one size fits all.

$review_text.: I've tried a number of cases for the Nexus 7 but was unhappy with how bulky they all were
This is the thinnest case I've found so far


It does a good job keeping the tablet safe and doesn't add much weight or size
My only complaint is that once opened there's no way to pin the flap flat against the back
Instead it just hangs or needs to be held down
I added a small Velcro strip which seemed to solve the problem


I can see how this could bug someone though.Overall though this is the nicest case I've used to date.

$review_text.: We build computers, and have since the days of windows 3.1 and the 286 processor.  We always wanted to splurge and take our home computer to the Gaming Computer Performance Realm.  After a lot of consideration we decided to go with the AMD 965 Black Edition Quad Processor, and the ASUS AM3 M488t-M/USB3 mainboard.  This was a very good combination of features, value, and speed.  Asus features of unlocking cores, and express gate along with Quiet and Cool Technology are superb.  This motherboard is the easiest setup ever.  After the autodetect of the hard drive and dvdr, just set the boot order you want and you're good to go.  As it boots up to go you press #4 key as requested and wha-lah your cores are up and going.  You can get a version of this board that does SLI if you use two video cards.  One note on the video card selection.  Crossfire is a joke.  It is like bolting on your 4 hp lawn mower motor onto your Harley for a little better power.  Crossfire will work to take two lousy video cards and make it better.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T SCRIMP ON THE VIDEO CARD.  IT WILL DO MORE FOR YOUR GAMING THAN THE FASTER CPU.  GEFORCE GTS 250, GTX 9800, RADEON 5570 AND RADEON 5770 ARE EXCELLENT CHOICES AND LESS THAN A HUNDRED IF YOU SHOP.  We put in a sweet Radeon 5770 1 gb video card for about a hundred and it pumps out the graphics big time with sweet DDR5 and a fast GPU (Graphics Processor).  We went with 4gb or Kingston Blue DDR3 memory @1333 mhz.  DDR3 is CHEAP these days.  We installed Windows 7 Pro onto the Western Digital Green Hard Drive and the result was a very pleasing computer capable to do games, multi task, whatever.  Go with Asus and AMD and you'll be getting the best value.

$REVIEW.: I have to say this is a great deal for the price.  I actually purchased it to go w/my new MAC Mini.  It worked great overall and it appeared to look a lot like the Magic Mouse.  However, although the case it came in and the size was almost identical to the MM the quality and weight were much different.  Plus the MM does things that a normal mouse does not do.  I  now use it on my Windows Computer and have purchased the Apple Magic Mouse for my Mac.  Considering this was less than $10 and the MM was 6 times the price, this is a really good deal.  I would probably buy another in the future if needed.

$review_text.: This was the first lens I bought for my first SLR camera in 1997. Ahh, film.I have since graduated to a 24-70 f/2.8L II for this focal length range and I photograph professionally now. I couldn't have made it to where I am now without using this little guy, but it honestly wasn't very good. It wasn't very sharp, it has a variable aperture across the focal length range, it produces washed out colors, contrast is a little flat, and the bokeh doesn't look nice. All that being said, for less than one hundred dollars, this is a good deal. The autofocus speed is loud and slow, but you'll find that this lens serves an important purpose: it is a first lens. It will teach you how to compose, hand hold without IS, and manual focus. Those are all important skills.I know that there are better lenses that exist for a first lens, but none of them are as affordable as this little lens. For the price, this is a good deal. I'd also recommend it to someone who has child that wants to try photography, and you don't want to be too concerned that the lens will be destroyed by accident.Oh, I should also mention that I won a competition with a photograph of a baseball with this lens in 1998. It can perform, so don't write it off. Despite it's shortcomings, I think this is a lens that warrants consideration as an economy lens or as a backup lens.

$review_text.: If you are a PC person like me, this player has some nice qualities.  Nothing against Apple (I even own their stock), but iTunes is not where I shop for music, mainly because I want the ability to drag and drop music onto a player or sync it with a program. If you rip a lot of tracks from your CD collection, your gonna like this player.Right after I checked to see if everything worked, I started off my test of the player by updating the firmware.  A firmware upgrade will erase everything you have stored or settings you have changed on the player; hence, it is a good idea to knock it out before you poke around too much.  The first thing I really liked about the player is that as soon as I plugged it in to my PC via mini-USB, it showed up as a mass storage device in Windows and I could drag and drop to the device without any additional software.  I both created folders on the device and dragged nested folders with music and picture files.  They all showed up in the interface (music player or picture viewer) without a hitch no matter where I placed them in the file tree.  The file tree is displayed one level at a time but, as long as you don't get too carried away, navigation is straight forward and easy.  Then, I used Windows Media Player to sync the device with all of my music files.  Once again, everything went off without a hitch.  The device showed up in the player and I hit the sync button.  It was that easy.Next, I converted and loaded some AVI files to check the video playback.  The unit only plays MTV files so you will need to convert everything to play it.  The conversion interface is simple and easy.  Loading the player is drag and drop.  But, lets face it, watching anything on a screen less than two inches has limitations.  It is fun for showing baby footage or something from your cell phone camera from the last hockey game you went to.  That is about it for me.Finally, I took it to the gym for a test drive to see how well it held up in real life.In a nut shell, I liked:- The drag and drop capability from any PC without additional software- The easy sync with Windows Media Player (if you choose to)- The ability to use it as a BIG portable storage device for any file type- The in recorder function has good quality and records from the FM receiver built into the player.  It is also voice activated- It comes with a protective silicon cover- It is very light- The display is well laid out and easy to read- Navigation is easy, even while exercising- The supplied headphones are good.  I have never heard really good headphones supplied standard with a player, thoughI did not like:- The only supplied charging option is via your PC- The supplied neck strap is not very practical.  An arm band would be better- The supplied headphones could not compete with the sound at the gym.  The excessive ambient noise ruined the listening experienceAll in all, the player is not perfect.  However, the good qualities combined with the price make it a compelling buy.
$SUMMARY.: Given there is no perfect portable media player - this one is good

The 1000's deliver a much higher quality low-bass and give you the feeling that you're in the club
Paired with an e11 headphone amp, I'm loving these things


Yes they're oversized, but they're quite comfortable and I don't plan on wearing them around outside anyways.I like how the plug is straight instead of in an L shape like the 700's

When I use my amp on a flat surface with the 700's, the L shaped connector can be annoying as it doesn't always lay flat, but the 1000's straight plug doesn't give me any issues.I wanted to order some 500's from Amazon out of curiosity, but I've noticed that they've been pulled along with the 300's and the 700's
I wonder why Amazon isn't selling them directly anymore? The Sony XB series is amazing.

yes read the instructions.Has an option for setting two different alarms, kind of nice.The iPod/iPhone elevator (so that it supports all of the different sized devices) works, but isn't all that great.Actual audio quality of the Memorex Alarm Clock Radio iPod/iPhone dock is good but not the best I've heard from a clock radio or iPod dock

Nothing to be disappointed with but lacks mid and low frequencies.The bright white clock display is actually too bright
Having it at on my end table next to my bed kept me awake the first night


So if you are one of those people who needs a pitch black room, don't get this alarm clock.Overall I'm very pleased

It wakes me up (to whatever song I want), has a good AM/FM radio function, and looks pretty snazzy (I love things that are square/rectangular).

To me its better than standard headphones and being that its snugged in your ear, you could hear some bass.  It is what it is and I wasn't expecting alot from it.  There isn't any instructions but, simple plug in and listen.  Also comes with 3 different sizes of ear caps or rubbers or whatever you call them.  If bass is your thing and expectations are high, go for something else.  For me its good enough.  Hope this somewhat helps and sorry I wasn't too descriptive.  Quite general.
