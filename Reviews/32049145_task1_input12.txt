$REVIEW.: This DVD basically just adds an hour to the full 14-hour Engineering Disasters collection.  As such, it's not as good of a value from a cost standpoint.And as noted by another reviewer, they cram quite a few case studies into this hour, so the coverage of each case lacks some depth.Despite that, the quality of the DVD is still good overall, so I think this is well worth getting if you have an interest in engineering disasters.

$REVIEW.: Arguably the greatest ballet company in the world, even the Bolshoi Ballet can be boring, as is demonstrated by this revised warhorse.  A young Englishman in Egypt, Lord Wilson, goes to sleep in the desert and finds himself transported to pharaonic antiquity.  He saves the pharaoh's daughter, Aspicia, from a stuffed lion, and gains her undying love.  But Aspicia has been betrothed for political reasons to the King of Nubia, so the two must be separated.  Rather than marry the king, Aspicia would jump into the river -- so she does.  There ensues a nice blue-silvery scene with the god of the Nile and his entourage, after which Aspicia returns to the court just in time to save Lord Wilson (now aka Taor) from being executed.  Her father relents, the two are united, and clouds envelop everybody.  Lord Wilson wakes up and is astonished to find it was all a dream.  Aspicia is danced by the lovely, elegant ballerina Svetlana Zakhorova, ably partnered by Sergi Filin (now Artistic Director of the Bolshoi Ballet), and the corps is splendid.  But why waste their time and ours?

$REVIEW.: As much as I enjoyed The Grinch live-action film, I have to say I am even more impressed with Horton Hears a Who.  This film really captures the look and feel of Dr. Seuss' charming children's books.  "Horton Hears a Who" is about an elephant named Horton who, one day, happens to hear a tiny voice on a tiny speck.  Within a short amount of time, he realizes that that tiny speck contains an entire world of the people called "Whos", who happen to be in dire need of protection.  Unfortunately, not everyone has the ears to hear a Who, and soon the least kind among them (an authoritative kangaroo voiced by Carol Burnett) stirs up the rabble and everyone turns against him.Colorful and crazy, this animation brings Seuss' drawings to life.  Jim Carrey does a wonderful job of making Horton both silly and sincere, playful and touching as he goes against the grain of belief to hold onto a truth that only he knows.Sounds pretty deep for a family film--in fact sometimes the friction provided by Carol Burnett's character can get rather heavy-handed.  But it all works out in the end, and it is Horton's compassion towards those who would harm him that brings the message home.  Simultaneously fighting this same battle is Steve Carell's character, the Mayor of Who-ville and the only one who knows about Horton.  The chemistry between these two comedic talents brings their shared situation into an enjoyable, wacky ride to the finish.The two-disc edition of this DVD (this product) contains a disc of the movie, with many bonus features:  deleted scenes are organized into three categories of completion, and show you everything from rough storyboards to semi-finished products.  There is also a goofy short film set in the Ice Age world, with Sid the Sloth and Scrat the Squirrel.  Plus many behind-the-scenes extras about Horton Hears a Who:  an interview with Jim Carrey, shorts on how the film was made, and bits and pieces of Seussian background.The second disc contains a digital copy of the film, which means a file that you can copy and unlock on a computer or any portable device that can play the movie back (provided the device can play Windows Media Player or iTunes files).For anyone with children, this movie will appeal on all levels.  It does a nice job of avoiding crude humor and it portrays wacky, silly slapstick in a delightful way.  Very small children might be distressed near the end, but ultimately it all ends sweetly, and I suspect they'll be asking you, "Can we watch it again?"

$review_text.: I was sitting around watching the Independent Film Channel when all of a sudden this movie came on. It looked good, so I decided to watch it. Also, I heard of it before. As I got into the movie, I began to enjoy, unlike a lot of the movies on this channel.The movies about a young teenager who really wants to be a skinhead like his older brother Derek Vinyard, who is famous for starting up a group of skinheads in Venus Beach, California. The trouble start up when Derek goes off to jail for killing two young African Americans who were breaking into his car on night.The movie starts off with Danny, the young skinhead brother, getting in trouble with the principle of his school, who happens to be African American, for writing a book report on Mein Kumph, Adolf Hitler's autobiography. The teacher now sends Danny into a class which he will teach named American History X. To start off the class, Danny has to write a new report on his brother Derek. Even though Danny hates the idea, he still agrees to write the paper.Around this time, Derek is released from jail. However, his look has changed. He no longer pocesses his rebellious bald scalp, but a full head of hair. He is met early by the still bald-headed Danny, who tells him about the report he has to do. Shocking to the boy, Derek tells him to do the report, and says it wasn't a good idea for him to write on Hitler. Derek also discovers that Danny has joined the group that he had been a part of, and taken the same mentor that Derek took when he was a skin.Intense, disturbing, and touching at times, American History X gives the story of a family who has been torn down by racism. With excellant performances from Edward Nortan and Edward Furlong, this movie packs a message about the neo-Nazi skinheads of America. This is definatly a movie anyone on the planet shoulld see. It pulls in family, anti-racism, and changes that will shock you until the end.

$REVIEW.: When Yakuza Demon opens with crime boss, Muto (played with sad elegance by Kaichi Iwaki), flying a model of a Zero near sunrise in a large field, his smile wistful as he works the controls, spinning the toy plane through slanting rays of the rising sun, the viewer is immediately tuned into the kind of doomed honor that will mark this film.Briefly told: a foot soldier in a very minor, poor Yakuza family runs slightly amuck, protecting the family's boss who has gone crossways with the powers that be. The soldier (played by Yakuza and V-film legend Riki Takeuchi) is nicknamed "Sinji the ripper" and with good reason. Now, both sides are out to destroy this tiny triad. What no one can anticipate, though, is the loyalty and love that bind this tiny family together.Takashi Miike is an astounding filmmaker. This film has a lonely, abandoned feeling about it - a sad tone - that Miike produces simply with shot composition, lighting, and editing. There is a particular sequence (when Yoshi, the youngest member of the family, goes to meet his girlfriend and must confront apposing gang members alone) that creates a near overwhelming feeling of pathetic doom.Perhaps Miike is something very rare - a kind of freak, maybe. Like the child that can play a piano at two, or a kid from the cornfields that can swat homers while still in kindergarten; that is to say, a natural.His work seems effortlessly original. -Mykal Banta

$review_text.: Strip away the excess padding of the film's hefty 111 minute running-time and some of the more overblown musical numbers and you just might enjoy this as much as the first "High School Musical", but then you've missed the whole point.  Director/choreographer Kenny Ortega really goes to town with HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 2, the sequel to the surprise smash-hit Disney Channel movie, set during the gang's summer vacation.When Troy (Zac Efron), Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) and their friends all land summer jobs at the ritzy Lava Springs resort owned by Sharpay and Ryan's parents, they simply can't believe their luck - and there's even going to be an end-of-summer talent competition!  But when Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) starts manipulating Troy for her own amusement, will he choose a college scholarship over Gabriella and his friends?The plot is as predictable as the first movie, but these "High School Musical" films need to be enjoyed on another level entirely.  Kenny Ortega has furnished the movie with tonnes of electric dance routines and the cast gives their absolute all.  Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens make sweet music in the leads but the spotlight always ends up roaming to Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel as the duplicitous twins Sharpay and Ryan--they really get to shine in this film.Recommended.

$REVIEW.: It is said that just before death the sum total of a person's existence passes before the eyes in a fraction of a second. The essence! Truth without pretense. For the artist, "La Belle Noiseuse" is that essence captured on canvas. Edouard Frenhofer is a master painter who has spent the past 10 years languishing in contented happiness. Languishing because an artist actively pursing the truth in art is never contented. Blood needs to be shed and suffering must be endured for truth can be cruel. "La Belle Noiseuse" was Frenhofer's unfinished masterpiece; an attempt that was abandoned. To paint the truth it is not enough to  merely copy what is seen by the eyes. One must go all the way, to penetrate, to . . . invent! This film painstakingly details the relationship between the artist and the model. The attempt by the artist to venture into the soul, and to return not only with the essence of the subject, but the essence of the artist as well. The script is loosely based on the short story "The Unknown Masterpiece" by  Honore de Balzac. This tale was also highly influential on the painter Picasso.

$review_text.: Jennifer Aniston breaks out of her "Friends" persona to play a bored housewife desperately trying to make a change in her life. Aniston totally transforms herself to play this role. Not just in terms of adopting a southern accent, but also in terms of body language. Jennifer moves and behaves in ways that we have never seen her before and should be commended for it. Another notable aspect of her performance is her ability to get the audience to root for her despite some questionable choices her character makes in the film. She deservedly got an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Female Lead.The film is peppered with a host of interesting characters as a result of Mike White's off beat screenplay. He's written some very funny lines here. Tim Blake Nelson, who plays "Bubba" in the film, get one of the bigger laughs with the line, "I want to be a slut. A lesbian slut." Another one comes after "Justine" (Aniston) when she asks Jake Gyllenhaal's character why his parents call him "Tom" instead of "Holden," that she knows him by. You'll have to see the film for that one.There some intriguing plot developments that take the viewer on an unpredictable ride to the finish. Without giving away the ending, I'll just say that it is not a "Hollywood" one. This may not sit well with the crowd that likes formulaic "by the book" stories.Overall, "The Good Girl" is a film for someone looking for something off beat, off center and very funny.

$REVIEW.: This is a re-issue of a previous release by the Criterion Collection but features a brand new transfer of the film, which looks fantastic. All of the previous extra material has been carried over.There is an audio commentary by filmmaker Al Reinert and astronaut Eugene Cernan, the last man to set foot on the Moon. Reinert provides some insight into how the film came together. He went through thousands of hours of footage and managed to put together an 80-minute film. Cernan shares some of his experiences about what it was like to be an astronaut at that time.New to this edition is "An Accidental Gift: The Making of For All Mankind," a 30-minute retrospective documentary. Reinert always wanted to see this outer space/Moon footage on the big screen and this was the impetus for the film. He got his start as a journalist covering NASA in the early 1980s. Through his contacts he got access to their film archives and found footage that had never been shown. This is an excellent look at how For All Mankind came together.Also new is "On Camera," a compilation of on-camera interviews Reinert conducted with 15 of the Apollo astronauts. In the film itself only the audio is used and it is nice to put a face to the voice."Painting from the Moon" is an updating of an extra on the original edition. After retiring from NASA, astronaut Alan Bean became a painter and this is a gallery of his work with commentary."NASA Audio Highlights" is a collection of 21 soundbites from the first ten years of the American space program. Some of the most famous words have spoken during this time, including Neil Armstrong's immortal words.Finally, there is "3, 2, 1 . . . Blast Off!" a collection of launch footage of various rockets taking off for outer space.

$REVIEW.: O.K. time the official review. Just picked up last copy at BestBuy (sold out in a day). The 4 stars for picture is acurate. Solid HD Picture no grain, artifacting, unwanted movement except on stock footage of flight scenes (mostly at the start of film). Beautiful picture. The audio more than meets the challenge of this movie. One observation, as mentioned the DTS has some certain advantages over Dolby True HD. Well I am here to confirm, the DTS option is by FAR the best track on the disk. Much more dynamic, immersive, and just plain louder by several DBs. I found it an obvious choice, much to my dismay over the HD audio. And yes unlike alot of people, I do have it set up correctly. More than correctly. I am using King Cobra Audioquest interconnects for the 5.1 channel outs from the XA1 to my Denon 3806. I think there may be some mistake with sound. Usually it's the TrueHD that has the difference. Maybe they are mislabeled on the disk? Bottom line: Not only is this a MUST HAVE for your HDDVD collection, but a great example of what HDDVD delivers to the experience. I have a dedicated theater room. 133" screen and sound to match, even have real Buttkickers in the theater chairs. This movie makes my investment worth every penny. Word of caution: If you don't have a serious system, the sound will punkout your system. Listen at low levels or pony up and get something with some backbone '' High current Denon, Pioneer elite, Yamaha 2700 or higher or seperates like B&K, Krell, Macintosh etc). Extreme cinematic dynamics, just like the movies, and isn't that the whole idea? Highly Recommended

Of course it's not that simple; the film does raise some good moral questions about such a pill and its consequences, and I would've like to have seen that avenue explored a bit more. The performances are adequate, and Robert DeNiro has a few good stand-out scenes.

$review_text.: Over the years, Tom Selleck has developed into somewhat of a western icon. And why not? Selleck is spot on in fleshing out those qualities most cherished by folks of the untamed old west. And, of course, it doesn't hurt that he looks the part, all tall and rugged and bemustached. He's at it again in LAST STAND AT SABER RIVER, the 1997 TNT oater. In this one, he plays Paul Cable, a weary ex-Confederate soldier who returns home to Texas, knowing full well that the war between the states has already been lost, even as it rages on.The terrible war has left scars on Cable, but it's also deeply impacted his wife and children. In his absence, his family had learned how to get on. His suddenly showing up causes tension to surface and mount as everyone is forced to cope with the new family dynamics. In particular, Cable's relationship with his steely wife Martha is in the crumbles. His wife never did see why Cable had to go off to war in the first place. During his years away, their daughter fell ill and passed away, and this leaves a lingering bitterness within Martha. She is so deeply resentful of her husband.Struggling to readjust, Paul Cable takes his family back to the Arizona territory, back to their old homestead. But it ends up becoming yet another battle for Cable as he learns that Union sympathizers have overran his ranch. With his wife and children directly imperiled, Paul Cable means to fight one last time, to keep his land and his family.LAST STAND AT SABER RIVER, adapted from Elmore Leonard's gritty novel, is more a contemplative western drama than a typical shoot-em-up, although things do climax with two pretty darn good action sequences. Much of the tension is provided by Selleck and Suzy Amis, who is very good and intense as his estranged wife Martha. Tom Selleck has done this type of role so often now that he can do it in his sleep. Not to say that dude is sleepwalking here. Selleck brings a worn down gravity to his role. His character is stoic, although he's good enough that you glimpse the sub-text of alienation, of a man tired of warring and who merely wants a return to a normal life. Selleck exudes quiet strength and enough machismo that he gets away with sporting a pink-colored shirt for much of the film. Veteran western actors and brothers, Keith and David Carradine, step in for good performances, particularly Keith, whose character rises above the role of predictable designated villain. And, whoever that girl is who plays David Carradine's refined but bored daughter, well, she's muy caliente.Tom Selleck hasn't disappointed in any of his western films, although it's been a few years since he's done one, what with his involvement with the Jesse Stone movies. I say it's time for the man to get back in the saddle, hoist them six-shooters, and, yes, maybe even sport that pink shirt again (would it help to call the shirt salmon-colored?). There's still plenty of Louis L'Amour and Zane Grey novels out there, just waiting for someone to bring them to cinematic life. And Tom Selleck, he continues to embody that ideal man of the frontier.

$review_text.: This is one of my favorite movies - I thought it was hilarious.  Especially Allan Greer's (sp) father and his mushroom suit! That part always makes me laugh.  The only thing I didn't like about it was this  imaginary &quot;black&quot; world that was created.  There was only one  white person in the whole movie and of course they had to make that one  white person appear to be geeky or stupid.  The entire corporation was made  up of black people and even walking down the street there were only black  people.  These days if there was a white film that didn't have any black  people at all then there would be a big uproar about it.  I think movies  like this separate races rather then bring them closer.  In black America  it is socially acceptable making fun of white people (dancing and  speaking), but if it were reversed then WATCH OUT! Anyway, take the  black/white separation from the film and it would have been much better.  The ending was great too!

$REVIEW.: I don?t like fantasy. However, I?m a big movie buff. This trilogy has been a big box office success. And people whose opinion I trust have recommended that I see it.Well, the day finally came. And as I put this 3-hour epic into my DVD I was prepared to have an open mind.Yes, there were good special effects. And yes, the actors seemed adequate. But I hated the story. And, if it was supposed to be symbolic, it got lost on me.I just can?t relate to fantasy creatures. I don?t care about their problems. All I could do was look at the clock. Well, I lasted for 113 minutes. And I hated every one of those minutes.This is not a film for me. And I can?t recommend it.
$SUMMARY.: I can't relate to fantasty creatures. Well done but boring.

$REVIEW.: I am a huge fan of Lewis Black. I have watched him on Comedy Central for years now and love to catch his bits on the Daily Show. Definitly a creative genius, a bit hyper and unstabel, but still a genius.This DVD has several of his stand-up performances from Comedy Central, the best is the entitled &quot;the End&quot;. His take on the Super Bowl was a classic.I have heard some of his audio stand-up routines and it's true they are funnier, likely because he can curse on those. He holds back a little in the DVD, but it was for cable television so it's understandable why. That would be the only downfall, the lack of cursing. Otherwise this DVD is a must for any fan of stand-up comedy.

$review_text.: Y tu Mama Tambien has much to recommend it. The overall plot is an old one, or at least seems as if it has been done before - two teenage boys, left by their girlfriends for a summer, take a road trip with sexy older woman who teaches them a few life tricks - but this is no normal road trip movie. Tenoch and Julio are superb characters that encapsulate so much of the condition of contemporary Latin American youth. They are bold, handsome and cocky, think they are sexual masters but the reality leaves much to be desired, and have a package of passion including a keen awareness of the bonds of friendship and a hatred of the US that rings so true. They undergo a bildungsroman experience following an exuberant attempt to chat up Luisa, the sexy wife of Jano, Tenoch's intellectually and socially snobbish cousin, at a wedding. Luisa agrees to go with them on a shabbily planned road trip to a fictional beach destination. What Tenoch and Julio do not know, and cannot know as they haven't yet undergone the pains of human existence as people become adults in the world, is how much Luisa is suffering. To them, she is a hot chick, a fun older woman who seems to like them, and responds to their immature adolescent stag rutting behaviour. But Luisa is a disturbed, pained soul. She plays to the boys' whims, culminating in two brief, sweaty sexual encounters. But these do not satisfy her. The true extent or her problems are not revealed until right at the end of the movie, in a surprising and moving addendum.The backdrop of middle class Mexican lust and sweaty sex on the road is the real countryside of Mexico. The trio pass through tin villages, with peasant people and their old customs, like crowning the village queen, and flogging trinkets with supposed spiritual value to passers by. These scenes, whilst admittedly not quite fully integrated into the plot of the movie, present a poignant indication of the true state of affairs in Mexico, behind the pulsating sex and passionate bombast of the young and (relatively) wealthy.Y tu Mama Tambien is at once a funny, true, and sad movie, and worthy of its widespread acclaim.

$REVIEW.: What's it all about?  For who, is the question.  Caine plays the architypical tomcat who takes the yearning for sexual conquest and utter freedom from commitment to it's farthest yet most logical conclusion in this very entertaining drama/comedy that has the unique feature of having a main character often directly address the viewers even as other characters on the screen casually go about their business right next to him.  It's intriguing work and is nothing if not a philosophical treatise on the nature of man's conflict between his drive for sexual play and true intimacy.  In this day of PC and careful where you tread in dealing with women, this movie breaks all the rules by modern standards (and probably the standards of 40 years ago when it was made, although it could be argued that this is very much a product of the 'sexual revolution').  It's frankness and even coldness have the effect of causing one to question his/her own morality.  This movie does not preach but it certainly leaves one with something to think about, or perhaps it reaffirms one's own conclusions to some extent on the topic of "what it's all about".  For exposing an eternal dilemma and being very entertaining into the bargain, I give this movie 5 stars without hesitation.  If however you like your stories morally sanitized, or preachy, this may not be the film for you.

$REVIEW.: When asked what he thought of Kubrick's film of Lolita, Vladimir Nabokov said it was a &quot;first-rate&quot; film by an &quot;artist.&quot;  Even though only about twenty percent of his script made it into the final movie  product, Nabokov was obviously impressed.  The theatrical trailers ask the  question, &quot;How did they ever make a film of Lolita?&quot;  The only  way, in 1962, a movie could be made about such a controversial subject was  if it was presented as a comedy.  James Mason as Humbert Humbert is  excellent--speaks volumes with his eyes.  Perhaps Sue Lyon as Lolita is a  bit too old--she certainly doesn't fit the strict definition of a nymphet  (aged 9-14, as the book mentions), although she was, I believe, 13 when the  filming started.  Maybe Peter Sellers as Quilty isn't as serious as his  character may warrant, and may steal some scenes with his impersonations.  But so what?  We're talking about a movie made in the early sixties--the  theatre audience has certain expectations.

$REVIEW.: NOTE: This mostly positive review is for the 1974 version, not the remedial remake starring Nic Cage. That 2000flickwas a bomb. (Not 'da bomb'.)The original is straight-up guerilla filmmaking. Virtually all of the cars used in the filming belonged to Toby Halicki, a self-made entrepreneur and self-styled actor/director. I can only imagine that most of the supporting cast were friends and family or else struggling actors willing to work for free. When has another film ever been produced by a junk yard? Classic.In the same way that period heist films likeThiefutilized real techniques and on-set technical advisers in the form of professional burglars, (the real) Gone in 60 Seconds remains legitimate because its principal actor/director/producer truly had a passion for cars. The fact that he didn't mind smashing them up doesn't hurt, either. The epic near-forty-minute-long chase puts the Jerry Bruckheimer CGI debacle to shame, and instead compares favorably to extended chase sequences in films likeVanishing PointandThe Blues Brothers.So how does "mostly positive" result in a 1-star rating? As evidenced in other DVDs of period releases--such asSlaughter's Big Ripoff, which lost its funky James Brownsoundtrack--the original soundtrack here has been replaced by cheezy synthesizer tunes. I bought the Region 2 release from England but it has the same problem. Lame.

You can buy a week's worth of meals and still have enough change for a gallon of gas.  "Jennifer's Body" is as awful as the hokey title.  This one is simply horrible...not a moment worthy of fame...just shame.  I was expecting a horrific horror film.  It was more like the Sci-Fi Channel gone awry...horrible acting...horrible script...horrible soundtrack...and the special effects reminded me of movies from the 50s.  I think this film was concocted on the name and bodies of two young ladies (Megan and Amanda) who will never make it in the industry.  If they didn't have the moves and the grooves, they'd be working at the 99 Cent Only store.  Avoid this abomination.  Just horrible.  I'm so happy I bought it for $1.23 (really)...but don't be surprised if you find it on the shelves of the (you got it) 99 Cent Only store.

I love that not all people with brains are totally inept socially. (Because its true) The movie both feeds and fights the sterotype.I hadn't seen this movie in years but I grabbed it from a video sale, and do not regret it one bit.  I think perhaps this was the first film I saw Val Kilmer in, it makes me wish he did more comedy because he is so wonderful at it.  His chemistry with all of the other characters is the glue of the movie and is a joy to watch.It also is a teen comedy that actually might cultivate a few brain cells instead of killing them off with crude humour (not that there aren't a few sexual jabs scattered through out this film, but they are more witty than overt).I can't reccomend this movie enough.  For anyone who wants to just have fun watching a movie, look no further!

$review_text.: This Made-for-TV movie has a runtime of 3 hrs 20 minutes. This reviewer and regular Ann Rule reader thinks that is not long enough.Adam Greenman's teleplay adaptation of Ms Rule's True Crime bookAnd Never Let Her Go: Thomas Capano: The Deadly Seducer, leaves out a lot and might leave the non-reader watcher befuddled and confused. For example, the torrid tawdry Capano/Christine affair is barely hinted, although it was a focal point of the trial and fodder for the tabloids.In contrast to the teleplay writer's wrongful redactions, the Casting Director is to be commended.  Pre-Naval Intelligence Mark Harmon is perfect as the slimy Thomas Capano;  Kathryn Morris is not a Cold Case  as victim Anne Marie Fahey, who narrates a la Brenda Strong's Mary Alice YoungDesperate Housewives - The Complete First Season; Rachel Ward, she of ill-starred romance (The Thorn Birds) is a cool Christine; and MommaMoonstruck (Deluxe Edition)is a magnificent matriarch for the Capano clan.So read the book this week, then, this weekend,  make a nice cozy fire and settle in to watch a wicked good movie./TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer

I really enjoyed this series and would love it if future episodes were produced. The fourth "episode" is all music videos, so there are only five true episodes here.The originally released first episode isn't quite as light as the special edition version.

Little do they know that the government sees them as just another pawn to be used in regional power struggles. It's a rich story that we can easily relate to.

Which I saw on opening day to a packed house,and currently no.2 top movie in the USA at the moment

^_^As described by the other Amazon members,it's about a boy named Kenai who loses his oldest brother to a bear,and after killing the bear,is transformed into one

Kenai befriends Koda along the way
And towards the end,they look upon themselves as brothers and learn the importance of brotherhood.This movie actually has values in it
Which is good

Seeing as how some movies today are mindless dribble that do poorly in the box office soon after they hit

The band smokes through some classic material and actually improves on some of the songs. Highlights include the passages from pleasant shade of grey, Pieces of me, Quietus and Another Perfect Day. The best moment was saved toward the end of the show. They played "Still Remains" and this song is a progressive masterwork. This song will make you realize why this band is known as a progressive force. This song features Kevin Moore who provides awesome keyboard work. The band is in fine form throughout- Alder, Matheos, and Vera!! Nick does a fairly good job of filling the mammoth shoes of Zonder. DantanaLantana should praise me for purchasing this for him.

$REVIEW.: I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but it wowed more than it disappoionted. If you watched all the old Bruce Lee movies than you can see many of those aspects in the film as well as a little Clint Eastwood from his Sergio Leone movies. Total nonstop action from the get go. A good amount of gore, but it's not raining blood. Those movies put me off. No nudity, but a good deal of sexual situations. A little more character development would've been appreciated, as in I'm not really sure who the main character was. A really good performance from Russel Crowe, wasn't expecting it due to the type of film. Rick Yune did great as his character. Thought he was the main character until Crowe's showed up. But I think RZA was supposed to be the main character, which is really bad casting on his part. Just because you wrote and directed the film doesn't mean you have to star in it. He's not very built at all for the blacksmith character he's supposed to portray. He should've got someone else or hit the gym. Other than that, decent action flick. Reminds of the old spaghetti westerns and kung fu movies from the 70's.

$REVIEW.: Before I review this film I'd like to quibble with the photo on the DVD package.  It sports a large picture of Harrison Ford with star Gene Wilder obscured with a small picture of him in the left hand corner.  There's no denying the magnitude of Ford's popularity but, hey, this is Wilder's show and he is a respected actor in his own right.  Anyhow, this is a wonderful picture.  I absolutely love it.  It works on so many levels.  It works as a traditional western.  It's essentially a comic western in the veign of "Destry Rides Again" and not a parody of one like "Blazing Saddles" despite Wilder's presence.  As for Wilder, I could almost bet if he were to name one of his favorite characters he played he would say Avram Belinsky.  The film's establishing scenes in Poland give you the false impression that Avram is something of a buffoon.  When it transports to America Avram proves anything but.  For sure there is a childlike quality to him that's deceiving.  But Avram also proves to be a kindly, devout, and intensely moral man.  We root for Avram to succeed in the new and untamed land he has been called to serve as Rabbi.  As for Ford, he is winning as a goodhearted but misguided bankrobber who helps Avram probably as some form of redemption.  Despite their different acting styles, Ford and Wilder have great chemistry.  I'm Roman Catholic but I can appreciate the intensity of Avram's faith.  I showed this film to my teenage nephew who is Jewish but he seemed unfortunately disinterested.  I did show it to an older Jewish friend and fortunately he loved this film.

This gives that immortals "power" aka strength to the victor.One day their are called to do battle in a far away land until their is only one remains, and the winner gets supreme knowledge and an unkown power which can spell doom if it were to fall in the wrong hands. So Connor Mcleod (played by Christopher Lambert) is fighting his greatest challenge. The Kurgan, an immortal Connor met in the 1500's who activated Connor's immortality.This movie is just a feast for the eyes, and was very impressive in the mid 1980's and is still very impressive to this day.

Read books and professional opinions on the topics.  Study books on related psychological discussions.  Read books by Caroline Knapp - to view the first person introspections of a woman with eating disorders and likely related thinking distortions.

$REVIEW.: This is a really bleek film with some harrowing scenes of holocaust survivors reduced to cannibalism to survive.I think it's great that the producers of the film sought out sympathetic scenes of destruction and desolation (Mt St Helens, etc)rather than resorting to computer graphics

 This placed all of the cast under great pressure - particularly Viggo Mortensen, who is an indomitable spirit - and who undertakes the role of teaching his son - played by Cody Smit-McPhee to survive him, that is, to discover the fire within himself
But for all the transcendental love which Mortensen's character shows, it is clear that he is deluding himself in a sense, for his son is far too vulnerable and too young to fend for himself


The boy is just an albatross around his father's neck, but the father's love will not be extinguished
The son presumably represents an idealised human spirit, and his father will undergo unspeakable hardships to promote the next generation


 What irked me was having to listen to the boy implore his father with the words, "Papa, papa" far too many times throughout the movie

I understand this is a homage to Cormac McCarthy and his own son, but it really grated
 But for this, an excellent film, far more engaging than Day of the Triffids (!) Recommended

$review_text.: Dear Universal,I know, being the intelligent people that you are, you can read the comments here and elsewhere about the total lack of extras that have appeared in these Columbo sets up to now (repeat after me..."Mrs. Columbo" is not an extra), and if you haven't figured it out yet, you're really starting to irritate us fans.  Now I know like all large impersonal corporations you really don't care about the bottom-line (cough) and only want to see your customer base happy and content.  Therefore I would like to point out to you that Season 6 has only 3 episodes - half the number of Seasons 4 & 5, and that means 3 fewer episdoes you have to pay to clean-up and restore!  Now wouldn't it be nice to fill up all that empty space on those disks with the extras we really want to see - interviews, outtakes, the original NBC Mystery Movie opening (hey, you and NBC are family now since Vivendi owns you both)...I'll even let you throw in a "Mrs. Columbo" episode if you provide the other items!  Think how happy your customers will be.  Think how happy you will be when you can get away with charging the same price for 1/2 the normal number of episodes.  It sounds to me like a win-win for both of us!

$review_text.: I'm biased though
If I'm not in Scotland then I'm thinking of being there so the premise for this series is seems natural to me
The actors are all well cast and most of the scripts deal with issues of trust and honor so it carries this beyond just a gash and slash type of series
Sure, there is violence but it's well done with reserve and the one aspect that sets this series apart is that things are done for honor and not senseless power on the part of Duncan MacLeod
I've been all over the ancient MacLeod lands in the west of Scotland & Islands and it's easy to see this series being 'alive'


Thoroughly enjoyable series with good personal interactions and emotions among those who befriend each other and protect each other

Many good lessons in patience and kindness to be seen.

$SUMMARY.: Classy series


Well acted/written
Time travel element fascinating

Focus is on honor.

$REVIEW.: Wow, do not let any of these good reviews fool you into watching this lame movie.  There is a reason that this did not come out in the theaters.  Stop for second and think.  Think of all the really crappy horror movies that have actually been RELEASED in the theaters.  Remember how the were not any good?  Now, try to think of a good reason why this was not released yet the movie is still good.The acting is horrible.  However, I do not know if anyone could do good acting with such a ridiculously bad, and downright dumb, script.  This movie tries to thread four stories into one movie except it rushes them all and none of them end satisfactorily.  Each of the four parts is really like a dumb gag that never gets finished.  Not even very good gags mind you.  I could go on and on about how bad this movie was but you get the point.Trick R Treat?  If you watch this you are surely not getting the treat you are getting tricked!p.s.  I can almost guarantee that these good reviews are fakes planted by the company that released this movie.  Don't be a sucker!

$REVIEW.: This motion picture was release in the USA in February 1976 starring the beautiful Barbara Bach as Barbara, Franco Nero as Carlo Antonelli, and Giancarlo Prete as Tommy. The picture opens showing these three thugs riding around in Europe robbing people, beating them up, killing them and anything else they wanted to do. In addition, no one could stop them. One day Carol Antonelli goes into his bank to deposit some money when out of nowhere the three thugs that the law is looking for comes in and robs the place. To add insult to injury the three thugs take Carlo as there hostage. As thug are driving and trying to get away from the cops who are chasing them, they beat the hell out of Carlo. The thugs abandon the car and get into another leaving the bloody and battered Carlo alone. Enters Barbara Bach. Who is sitting in the room as Carlo tries to explain his story of his beating and robbery to the local police. Carlo doesn't like the treatment by the local authorities so he decides to take things into his own hands. Enters Giancarlo Prete. Tommy is a young man who tries to make a living by robbing nickel and dime places. Carlo takes pictures of Tommy robbing a store and frames him in to trying to find the three thugs that robbed him and beat him up. Now some of my own personal thoughts on this picture! I was really disappointed with this picture. I thought Franco Nero was a bad actor, because the role he played as the victim was horrendous. I thing that Pierce Bronson or Chuck Norris could have played this role a lot better. The reason that I bought this movie, Barbara Bach was in it. Her beautiful body and her acting was a total wasted in this picture. She had maybe four scenes and they were not very long either. Therefore based on the acting of Franco Nero, no leading woman and they wasted Barbara Bach beauty and talent I give this movie 2 weasel stars and that's being gentle

$REVIEW.: Overall, the movie is superbly photographed and acted
The viewer feels like they're in the caves with the Japanese defenders of the island
 You feel the courage, the determination and towards the end, the despair of the Japanese soldiers from the lowest privates up to the commanding officers


The one very strange, upsetting event it when the two Japanese soldiers surrender and then murdered by the Americans assigned to guard them
What fool added this scene? It adds nothing to the story and turns the whole movie into a political statement of &#34;America/Western Culture is bad, Japanese/Eastern Bushido culture is misguided but more honorable than evil Americans.&#34;  That one peculiar scene utterly spoils what would be and outstanding movie.

$REVIEW.: "Ashanti" has loads going for it: Released in 1979, it was directed by Richard Fleischer and stars Michael Caine with an impressive supporting cast, including Peter Ustinov, Omar Shariff, William Holden and Rex Harrison (the latter three in very minor roles). If you're into exotic women there's Beverly Johnson, not to mention great exotic locations -- Israel, Kenya and Sicily (although much of the story takes place in the Sahara Desert). Caine's co-star, Kabir Bedi, is impressive as well.The story addresses modern-day slavery. Caine's black wife is apprehended by slave-traders and he chases them across the Sahara Desert all the way to the Red Sea. I know of two beautiful women who completely disappeared abroad. What happened to them? Were they apprehended by slavers? Did they become sex slaves? No one knows. The film illustrates this very-real possibility."Ashanti" plays like a wannabe "Lawrence of Arabia" but doesn't even come close. It's marred by a horribly dated 70s score whereas the score to "Lawrence" is timeless (even though it's older by about 17 years!!). Plus, "Lawrence" is believable from beginning to end, whereas I found myself mumbling "Yeah, right" numerous times while watching "Ashanti." In other words, too many scenes come off unconvincing or slightly awkward.BOTTOM LINE: "Ashanti" sounds great on paper but they needed to take more time in the creation process to work out the kinks in the writing, acting, directing and score.Still, the locations are great, there is a lot of action and the film provokes thought on an important subject. It's definitely worth picking up if you're a Caine fan or if you're into desert-survival flicks, especially since it's so cheap. Same thing if you favor Beverly Johnson (who's not the greatest actress). It's quite a bit better than caine's similar African adventure "The Wilby Conspiracy" (1975).The dvd features only a full screen version but the picture is quite good. Unfortunately the menu is cheap, featuring only "Play Movie" and "Trailer;" there isn't even a scene selection option.GRADE: C

$REVIEW.: What a load of miserable killjoys we have out there critiquing this movie! This was a smashing little film that the whole family could go and enjoy together and all age groups would find something in it for them!I took my 13 year old nephew with me to see ROBOTS, we had both had enjoyed Ice Age which was made by the same film company so we were looking forward to this movie and we weren't disappointed.The plot is short and sweet; Rodney Copperbottom a young bright and sparky Robot from Rivet City wants to be an inventor so with the blessings of his dishwasher father (literally a dishwasher!) he sets off to Robot City to link up with the famous Bigweld (Mel Brooks in a large metal pot!), a larger than life Robot who Rodney's hero, after his father that is!Along the way we meet up with Fender, voiced over by Robin Williams, he and "outmode" a model of robot that in theory should be recycled, his perky sister Piper, Aunt of the very large metal backside, and an assortment of other misfits known as the Rusties who are all on the verge of a breakdown, literal and otherwise!Rodney soon finds out that Bigweld has disappeared from his famous factory and the up-grade fanatic Ratchet is running the show and there is nothing he hates more than out moded robots.Along with his evil mother Madame Gasket, she is actually quite a scary creation, Ratchet sets about his dastardly plan, making sure no more spare parts are made for older robots, selling the idea that new is better than old and old should be scrapped.But Rodney has other ideas and with his plucky band of out-moded robots, a sexy upgraded female robot called Cappy and Bigweld himself, they take on Ratchet and his minions in a laugh a minute fight to the death.Watch out for the subtle and not so subtle mick takes of many films we have seen and loved over the years, "Singing in the Rain," "From Dusk Til Dawn," "The Wizard of Oz" "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" "Braveheart" but to name a few, this is a fast moving, fun feel good animated comedy for the whole family.One of the funniest moments for me was when Fender after hearing Rodney's father achieving his dream of being a musician pipes up to the silent audience of robots, "Hey it's a new sound, Jazz and Funk, its junk!"I cracked up.Go and see this movie for yourself and make up your own mind, you might just surprise yourself and find you actually like it!

$REVIEW.: On the surface this sounds like an awkward concept with extremely questionable casting, and in execution it's exactly that. I'll admire the guts it took to look at this from a totally different perspective and cast Seth Rogen as the lead, but he really doesn't step up his game to match the opportunity. His character is a complete jerk, an unlikeable doofus I couldn't pull for in the even simplest melodramatic setup, and Rogen's constant pursuit of the perfect mistimed joke only adds fuel to the fire. Of course, it doesn't help matters that the movie itself is an incomprehensible mess, constantly straddling the line between reality and exaggeration, without a tangible player in the hunt. Director Michel Gondry brings a grand total of three surreal, dreamy, inspired scenes to the table and sleepwalks through the rest of the process, which is a major disappointment. An irritatingly generic action dump with neither an emotional connection to the audience nor a tangible hold on reality. In short, a total waste of time.

$REVIEW.: As many other reviewers have queried:  Why isn't this movie in widescreen format?  And couldn't the producers come up with any extra features?  The DVD itself gets 3 stars, but the movie deserves 5.These gripes notwithstanding, this movie is a modern-day Christmas classic.  It captures the joy and fear and exhilaration and disillusionment of what it was like growing up in an America of a by-gone era.  The late Jean Shepherd is from my parents' generation, but I can still relate completely to Ralphie, Randy and all their friends  -- bullies at school --  Not getting what you really want for Christmas -- having your mouth washed out with soap and fantasizing about the day when they'd all be sorry...  It's all there!Darren McGavin is great as the blustery but sentimental dad and Melinda Dillon as the mom who is wiser than her kids give her credit for.  The movie is touching and hilarious at the same time.  It's so hard being a kid sometimes!This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again and still laugh.

One of my teenagers brought this home and I put it on background while doing paperwork, but the TV is above my desktop and I watched every single minute, stopping as necessary when leaving the room.I admire the reviewer that has researched Jack the Ripper more deeply and tells us that we have been let off the worst of the worst.  That's fine by me.  Between Johnny Depp's performance, the other stars in the cast, the over-all screenplay and the period depiction, this was simply a fine offering.I might offer that Heather Graham shows great promise, brining to mind such stars as Jodie Foster and Julianne Moore.I'd like to see more reviewers use the "Insert a Product Link" that Amazon offers, instead of just typing out the name of a book or DVD.Here are some examples:The LibertinePirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest (Widescreen Edition)The Complete History of Jack the RipperA Study in Red: The Secret Journal of Jack the RipperThe Ultimate Jack the Ripper Companion: An Illustrated Encyclopedia

Any woman who has ever experienced this dilemma should fall totally in love with this film.  There are even many hilarious moments pertaining to this sports addiction.  The writer, Nick Hornby, also wrote &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and you can tell that the same person wrote both.  He has a very unique way of presenting men and their romantic foibles.

$REVIEW.: The Academy Award winner from 1989 stands out as a monumental film with stunning acting, crisp cinematography and one of the most realistic depictions of the horrors of war ever filmed.Matthew Broderick is compelling as Robert Gould Shaw, the young and inexperienced commander of the 54th Regiment of Massachusetts, an all-black unit initially deprived of the right to fight but eventually allowed to prove its mettle in a pivotal battle of the Civil War. Morgan Freeman exudes paternal strength and wisdom as the eldest member of the platoon. Andre Braugher, Cary Elwes, Jihmi Kennedy, and a brilliant Denzel Washington (winner of "Best Supporting Actor" Oscar) make this film a genuine classic.Making small but significant contributions to the film are Jane Alexander as Shaw's mother and veteran Raymond St. Jacques (his last role) as Frederick Douglas.A further nod of praise goes to James Horner's masterful score. His music, along with the harmonies of the Boys Choir Of Harlem provides as glorious a background as is the inspirational story itself.

$review_text.: A lot of the movie is handled deftly, well-cast, and crisp dialog.  The problem overall is that there are too many coincidences, tangled and questionable relationships, and trying to hold the unraveling threads together gets to be annoying. The insider aspects of the washington world get cartoonish at times and you need to accept them stylistically to enjoy the film.  The coincidences about the stolen briefcase, the reporter's relationship with someone's wife, the ending twist about the wife knowing about the $26,000 a month and discovering the killer's true employer, a bit over the top and sloppy.  The movie tried to create too much subtext and complications, but it wasn't properly developed.  Again, deft in places, but only average because of annoyances.

$REVIEW.: This show is very addicting. I caught half an episode one week and was hooked afterwards. Lets face it this show is HOT! But thats not all it is, its also moving, funny, emotional and interesting. The show focuses on a group of gay men and women living in Pittsburg. Theres Brian (SO UNBELIEVEABLY HOT!), Michael, Justin, Ted, Emmet, Melanie, Lindsay, Vic and Debbie. In the pilot 29 year old hot shot Brian meets 17 year old Justin. They hook up for the night and Brian thinks nothing else of it, Justin on the otherhand has fallen head over heels in love with Brian, as it was his first time. These two were extremely interesting to watch throughout the season, as we saw them develop and grow. Brian is my absolute favourite character and even though he can be an assehole you cant help but love him. The other are interesting too and i love them all. This show is beautiful and great to watch. If you dont watch it you dont know what you're missing out on, gay or straight, it doesnt matter!

$review_text.: This is certainly one of the classics of Masterpiece Theater and is highly recommended to all who are interested in historical drama.  It is a marvelously and beautifully realized set-piece that, for the most part, accurately describes the chaotic events that occurred during the days and months that led up to independance of the India and Pakistan (and the early nationhood of each).The characterizations of the leads and of all the actors in the cast are stunning and it is easy to forget that you are not watching a re-creation of the events.I was particularly impressed with the performance of Vladek Sheybal as Ali Jinnah and A. K. Hangal who played Sardar Patel.  Sheybal's aloofness and calculating manner simply nailed the Jinnah about whom I have read and Hangal's Patel was a brilliant "wheeler-dealer," manipulator and above all, a realist as I believe Patel clearly was.  They clearly outshined their more famous rivals, Nicol Williamson and Ian Richardson, who turned in their expected star performances and yet did not bring out the souls of their characters in the same depth as did Sheybal and Hangal.  Perhaps this was due to Mountbatten and Nehru being far more complex and greater men.  It is difficult to assess.  Janet Susman was marvelous as Lady Mountbatten and provided just the proper amount of tension to bring out some needed depth in the Mountbatten character that would otherwise have been lacking.  Dastor's Gandhi was just fine, yet coming a scant three years after Kingley's Gandhi, it would certainly seem to be in the shadow of that portrayal.  Yet it is satisfying.This set is particularly recommended to all with an interest in Indian history.  I have to admit that I am prejudiced in favor of India, having traveled to India in the 1970's and having lived with families there.  While there, I lectured on our U.S. First Amendment (Freedom of Speech) as the Emergency and subsequent election of the Janata Party occurred.  During this time, I had many discussions with Indian friends concerning their thoughts about the Raj.  Of course most agreed that independence had been inevitable for the world's largest democracy and that colonialism had not been very satisfactory for them.  Today, I am amused that I could even think to ask about the obvious, but the answers to these questions were not so to a naive young man and the Indian folks I met were always gracious and patient in answering my questions - both common Indian traits, which I am pleased to note can be easily seen in this film.

$review_text.: The greatest critics on the part of the global conspiracy that deals with cults and religious themes will be unable to link the non - existent Taylor - Eriksson group with the Illuminati or the Golden Dawn.In the group , an enthusiast of psychotherapy who has undergone self - initiation through gestalt - therapy , decides to form a self - help group in Poona in India with the aim to liberate it's members from among other things negative karma in future lives.The plot revolves around three members who had survived the group leader's pre - consciousness shift era experiments in the raising of consciousness.The future becomes unpredicteable for the group leader as he loses control of the group and the group loses control of tulpas generated as a result of confrontation of various fears. Two of the survivors go to Germany , one becomes a psychiatrist patient , the other a psychiatrist who believes himself to be capable of healing negative karma.The tulpas return to haunt their creators , and the group is dissolved as a result. Just to let people know there has never been any group that went by the name of the Taylor-Eriksson group and it is not associated with the original Golden Dawn in any manner.Until this film arrived , so far there had been little sucess in constructing splatter films. The most famous splatter film since then had been Braindead , which is of course a comedy like Bad Taste.Tears of Kali is an extremely spiritually liberating movie which terrifies the viewer into self - realization. The viewer in turn becomes obsessed with finding out the truth about the non - existent Taylor-Eriksson group , because the Taylor-Eriksson name is so haunting it cannot possibly have revealed any real person to my knowledge.During the first time I watched the film I had no doupt in my mind that it was fictious and not based on anything else but rumours about cults which made their members go through horrendous rituals in the 1980's , such as the Order of Skull & Bones whose rituals seem far less frightening than the therapies in this film.Furthermore the film focuses heavily upon the theme of Indian self - discovery group of which we know even less than the western ones.This film is made during the era when Drunvalo Melchizedek , Bob Frissel and David Icke are young men who are at the best time in their days and it has been decades since Aleister Crowley died. This film is so important to me that I feel that it's director , composer and some of the actrors , any who would like should visit Iceland and lecture about the movie , and about primal scream therapy.The man who leads the movie is symbolic of the author of the book Primal Scream. The therapautic subjects are symbolic of the viewer who is led into an Inferno , a chapter in his life where he must confront the dark side of his soul so that he can move on in his journey. In the end of the film it is revealed that the viewer has been put into the shoes of all the members of the group but I will not disclose how. As a splatter movie and a slasher film this film shocked me brutally , and it not easy for horror movies made by any director to shock me brutally. It did - and it has become the most recent cult classic in the history of German cinema.Funnily this film is often linked with the New Age. It's subtitle is; Dark Side of the New Age. The fact is this film has in my view absolutely nothing to do with the New Age. It has to do with a message which becomes profoundly clear once the second film in the triology has been watched after two or three times. This film goes beyound the New Age into a form of existential angst appropriate for 21st century thinking. There are no ascended masters here or related new age themes except maybe the concept of karma but even in this movie that concept is lifted from the veil of many of it's deranged fundamentalist new age proponents. Of course we have past lives but there is no need to go into extremes about the interpretation of the meaning of that.In this film that is done freely and in a manner that takes the film beyound almost all splatter movies that have been produced since before.The film reminds me also a bit of the story of Arthur Gordon Pynn in H.P.Lovecraft's short stories.
$SUMMARY.: one of the best german films ever!!!!

$review_text.: I haven't purchased the trilogy yet, I was investigating the versions. I read the one review that helps to clarify which boxed set contains the original release versus the special edition. I still wasn't absolutely sure which one to get though so I went digging around and I found this comparison chart on Amazon that I thought might be helpful to others, so posting it here. I didn't want to bring down the rating of this boxed set so I gave it 5 stars just so I could post this. Hope it's helpful to anyone else who isn't quite sure which set to get.Go to this link for the blu-ray version then scroll down to find the comparison chart:http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Complete-Episodes-Blu-ray/dp/B003ZSJ212/ref=pd_cp_mov_1

$REVIEW.: This is the second movie in the Donald Strachey Mystery series.  It is an improvement on Third Man Out (the first) which also was a thoroughly watchable mystery.The characters and the storylines are developing well.  There is more background information to show how Strachey became the man he is: loyal, trustworthy, tenacious and attracting trouble like a magnet.  His partner Tim (Sebastian Spence you can put your shoes under my bed at any time:0)), although not as prominent also developed more depth in this installment of the series.  It was like he is settling in for the long haul, relaxing into the role.I felt the story flowed more easily than Third Man Out and it was a little harder to pick the murderer - although I did by the second murder (but I usually do because I LOVE mysteries).I don't know if the fact that Chad Allen is actually an out gay man means he brings depth, understanding and a comfortableness to his role but he definitely portrays the character well and shows emotion realistically in the scene where he recounts his first gay relationship experience and the tragic outcome of that.  He seems relaxed and real - which is not an easy thing to do - as Strachey.I think although being gay oriented, because of the characters, it is not an in your face type of prominence.  It shows being gay is as normal as being blonde - it just is, you can't change it (although ironically the storyline in this movie is centred around this being otherwise).  I like that it is woven into the story showing gay people have real lives, real relationships, real problems and real love.  (Sigh) I love a love story and this fits into that liking as well. It gets to me on a couple of levels which is refreshing - mutli-satisfying.I am definitely looking forward to the next one.  If they keep developing in depth and quality this will prove to be a must-have series for film buffs, especially those that love the mystery genre.

$review_text.: Anyone looking for a "great" movie will probably be disappointed, but anyone looking for sheer fun will probably be more than satisfied.  Director Steven Sommers took his enjoyable 1999 movie "The Mummy" and expanded it out to an epic scale.  The action picks up 10 years after the original; tomb raiders Evelyn and Rick O'Connell (now married, with 8-year-old child Alex in tow) discover another Egyptian artifact (the bracelet of the legendary Scorpion King) that unleashes yet another peril to the world, and once again, Evie and Rick have to stop it.A contingent of bad guys, however, want in on the action, and they raise Imhotep (the mummy from the first movie) because he's the only one strong enough to take on the Scorpion King.  The bad guys are led by a woman named Meela, who claims to be the reincarnation of Anck-Su-Namun, Imhotep's long-lost forbidden love.Sommers cleverly adds an expanded backstory to the main characters from the  earlier film, and while some of it stretches the imagination-- it seems like every character is a reincarnation of someone else-- it's executed in a mostly fun and believable way.  In particular, the development of an ancient rivalry between Evelyn and Meela is fabulously well-done, adding considerable dimension to the reasons for Imhotep's horrible punishment in the first film.  Arnold Vosloo was great in "The Mummy," but now, teamed up with his long-lost love, he's a thousand times more fun-- creepier, smarter, and yet at times endearingly vulnerable.Mystical warrior Ardath Bay (the very hot Oded Fehr) also has an expanded role in this film, and helps ground viewers when they are faced with things like multiple reincarnations and hoardes of screaming pygmy mummies.  Fehr brings exactly the right touches of appeal, swashbuckling dash, and "exotic" Middle Eastern mystery to the role.A surprising amount of care seems to have been given to the supporting characters; they have just enough depth but not too much: Evie's brother Jonathan is back, providing much of the comic relief (but he also has some wonderful moments of heroism); little Alex is fun and resourceful without being overly precocious.  Special care seems to have been taken with the villains: they are by turns menacing, funny, and *smart*, often a rare thing in the action/ adventure genre.  In particular, Bay's rival Lock Nah is well-written and well-acted.The script isn't exactly Shakespeare, but it's fast, funny, and (mostly) makes sense.  The action sequences are spectacularly well-choreographed, and of course, the special effects are impressive.  Sommers also allows some wonderful moments of human emotion: the sexual chemistry between Evie and Rick (ditto Meela and Imhotep); Jonathan's concern for his sister and nephew; Evie and Rick's love for their son; Bay's concern for his friends (and his great affection for his wonderful hawk).  These little touches make the difference between a mindless action flick, and something that really stays with you after the credits roll.Oddly enough, the much-touted presence of WWF star "The Rock" as the Scorpion King turns out to be almost negligible: it's a cameo that mostly sets up his own epic "The Scorpion King," due out in 2002.  The real heart of this movie are the Evelyn-Rick and Imhotep- Anck-Su-Namun love stories.  Without these and the other great characters from "Mummy Returns," it's hard to imagine that the next movie in this franchise could possibly top this one.So if you're looking for something great, rent "Lawrence of Arabia."  If you're looking for a highly enjoyable popcorn flick, "The Mummy Returns," should fit the bill perfectly.

$REVIEW.: Barefoot Gen is at the same time a compelling visual of the horrors of war and a cheesy soap opera; a devastating tale of courage and survival and a badly written one dimensional flick. Gen can be seen as the polar opposite of the epic masterpieceGrave of the Fireflies (2-Disc Collector's Edition), for although they deal with similar subjects the way they go about doing it are completely different in both style and quality. Where Fireflies focuses on the small picture, one brother trying to care for his litter sister, Gen is bent upon showing the "big picture" of the war, the devastation that it brought upon the whole country. The difference is that in Gen, to get the desired emotional response they had to kill over 200,000 people, and when the mass deaths stopped so did the films quality; in Graves they only had to kill one, and that one death was more meaningful and more heartbreaking then all the millions of deaths in Barefoot Gen.Gen is an energetic ten years old boy, living with his pregnant mother, his pacifist father, his overbearing older sister (about fourteen) and his loyal disciple, Shinji, whose maybe six years old. The war with America hasn't yet reached them in Hiroshima; they have food shortages, and every now and then they are rudely awakened by air raid sirens, but other than these inconveniences they are able to live their lives without the threat of being killed on a daily basis.  But their mother is getting sicker, and baby in her womb is in danger of dying. Gen and Shinji take it upon themselves to find good, healthy food for her to eat. The movie is a feel good, heartwarming story about family trying its best to live their lives while their country falls apart around them.That all changes, however, on August 6, 1945. On that fateful day Gen is on his way to school when he glances into the sky and sees a lonely B-29, the sun reflecting off its wings, flying overhead. A young girl beside him comments on how strange it is to see an American bomber all alone. Gen drops a pebble and bends down to pick it up; a moment later the sky turns white, a thunderous boom splits the air, and Gen looks on in horror as the girl who, seconds before, stood beside him took the full force of the atomic blast, her eyes melting out of their sockets, her skin instantly turning charcoal grey, skin peeling off her arms and legs. The visuals of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima is almost enough to make me a pacifist, its devastation so real and unquestionably brutal that only a heartless monster could watch it and not think about how evil war is. It's all too much for anyone with a weak stomach; a small girl instantly turning into a skeletal; a baby suckling on the breasts of its already dead mother; a young boy trapped beneath the weight of his own home, screaming, pleading, for his mother to save him before the atomic fires burn him to death. A dead infant in its mothers arms; zombiefied children, transformed by the radioactive fire, shambling about in the ruble, their eyes and skin melted away, seeking out the relief of water and drowning to death once they find it. Gen survives by sheer luck, but his family isn't so fortunate. The death and sorrow of these twenty minutes of film are almost unsurpassed in film, anime or otherwise.Unfortunately once the initial shock of the bomb subsides the weaknesses of the film return in full force, driving the memory of those twenty minutes away and forcing the viewer to suffer though another hour of bad writing, bad acting, and an overall bad war commentary. No attempt is made to make Gen into a rich, three dimensional character; he serves as a plot tool only, the eyes though which we are shown the devastation of the war, but little more. The film takes the most illogical plot turns, and the characters act and speak in ways that will make most people scratch their heads in confusion. When the filmmakers realize this, they kill someone else off, but this time the emotional impact is more like a cheesy soap opera then anything else.Barefoot Gen is simply the cartoony version of Grave of the Fireflies. It is in every way Graves's inferior, in animation, music, character development and plot, it fails in every way to match the creative guineas of Ghiblis classic film. Those who have never see Graves might find this a breath of fresh air, but to those who have Gen will be nothing more than a cheap imitation, void of the same life and warmth which resonated so well with Graves. If not for the twenty minutes of death and suffering, this film would be nothing more than a bad war movie.Film one; 3/5.Film 2; 2/5.Overall; 2.5/5. Rounded to three.Replay value; low.

$REVIEW.: STORM WARNING is one of the most brutal and savage thrillers you'll ever see.  The plot has been done about a million times, but the director and five actors manage to stand the story on its head and give it a few new spins that will make your hair stand up.The conceit of the movie is simple:  Pia (Nadia Fares) and Rob (Robert Taylor) are an upwardly mobile couple in Australia who go for a bit of sailing and end up lost in dangerous territory.  Pia is an artist and Rob is a lawyer, and neither of them are suited for what they encounter in this film.The screenplay was written over 30 years ago, but was thought too violent to produce, so it never got made till now.  After viewing the film, I have to agree about the violence.  This is mean, bitter stuff that will take a truly stouthearted viewer to watch.I also had to admit that the scenery is breathtaking.  The Australian setting is absolutely beautiful.  With the way the director slowly pulls the audience into the madness that's about to erupt, there's plenty of time to enjoy the local flora and fauna.  I have to admit that the pacing was, at times, almost too slow.  But once the story got up and running, you couldn't break away from the screen.While running from the storm and hoping to get their bearings, Pia and Rob reach a remote farmhouse.  After breaking in, they quickly discover that there is nothing normal about anyone that lives there.  Sex toys lay out in the open and pages ripped from skin magazines decorate the walls.  I knew at that point that only bad things could happen.Just minutes later, Rob discovers a huge amount of marijuana growing in the barn.  He realized at the same time I did that whoever lived there couldn't afford to let them escape.  And at that moment, the rough men they'd seen earlier arrived back at the house.This is when the movie really ratchets up.  I knew things were about to go south quickly, and from that moment until the end of the movie, I never took a relaxed breath.The menace grows slowly, almost like the tightening of a vise, and it won't let the viewer go.  I was mesmerized by what Pia and Rob had to deal with.  One of the worst parts was the fate of the joey, the baby kangaroo.  Although I could understand it, the idea of what took place is still stomach-wrenching.One of the worst aspects was the gradual build-up of the violence.  I totally understood how everything could escalate and be so bad.  And I understood the steps Pia and Rob had to take to ensure their safety.  Watching all of it was hard, and there was a definite mix of vindication and horror elicited on my part.The fishing lure trap in the barn is going to set the teeth of a lot of viewers on edge.  It was horribly hard to watch, and the subsequent beating later - complete with all the special effects - was difficult.STORM WARNING is recommended only for horror fans and suspense junkies that like blood and realistic effects.  The tense atmosphere is amazing, but the violence is drastic.  The director, Jamie Blanks (URBAN LEGEND), clearly knew what he wanted and got it.  Although a lot of the low-budget horror films end up with a grainy finish, STORM WARNING looks slick and pretty.  A top-notch thriller that draws blood.

$review_text.: The bond between two single mothers, one black and one white, and their daughters is the subject of this wonderful movie.  Lora Meredith (Lana Turner), a struggling actress, meets homeless and unemployed domestic Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore); moved by Annie's plight and in need of help, Lora takes Annie and her daughter Sarah Jane into her home.  As the years pass, Lora becomes the toast of Broadway while steadfast Annie suffers horribly because Sarah Jane is embarrassed by her mother's dark skin and wants to pass for white.This 1959 film is full of fine performances and good writing that overcome the occasional clich&eacute;s and soap-opera feel.  Turner does put the 'melo' in this drama with her silly histrionics, but that's how her shallow and conceited character would act.  Sandra Dee is good and perky as always as her teenage daughter, but the film belongs to Juanita Moore and Susan Kohner, who plays Sarah Jane.  Their story line is the more interesting one, fraught with heartache and regrets.  Moore is a wonderful actress and quite often moved me to tears with her quiet, unconditional love in spite of her daughter's rejection.  Sarah Jane should have been played by a black actress, but Kohner is excellent.This is a movie that can be enjoyed over and over.  The wardrobe is lovely, the sets colorful, and the dialogue is realistic.  Recommended.

$review_text.: I didn't watch the movie in the theater because I figured that it's one of those children movies and I probably won't enjoy it.  After reading about  three reviews on Amazon.com and the good reviews from the viewers (dog  lovers) out there, I had to give it a try.My wife and myself watched the  movie with our two dogs sitting next to us.  We love our dogs but I wanted  to watch the movie not because of the story of a boy and his dog (I could  have watched &quot;Ben&quot;) but because I wanted to see this touching  story and the relationship one has with their pets, that's what I was  interested in.After we were done watching, we were both in tears.  I  looked at my two dogs and it reminded me of how much these pets are a part  of our lives.  The storyline of a kid who is bullied and how his dog helps  him through his young life and eventually gains friends to the last 15  minutes which will nearly shatter your heart.  An emotional roller coaster  this movie turned out to be.Ok...as for the DVD, the audio is mostly  dialogue but the rear speakers are used pretty well.  Especially during  the baseball game.  The video is clear and the colors are good.  As for  the special features, you get two feature-length audio commentaries.  One  with Frankie Muniz and animal trainer Mathilde DeCagney and the other with  director Jay Russell.  It was cool to see the deleted scenes and part of me  wishes they left it in and I wish the director elaborated why he removed  them from the movie.  And of course, the ever loveable trailer and scene  selections which I don't count as special features (all DVD's should have  those).All in all, &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; is a wonderful movie.  I  recommend this movie to all dog lovers.  Those who dislike canines or any  pets would probably not watch this movie anyway... Highly recommended for  the dog loving fans out there and remember to have the tissue box nearby.

$REVIEW.: Almost all of Stanley Kubrick's movies are masterpieces and this is no exception. The most misunderstood movie of 1999 is actually quite good. As with all of Kubrick's films you can sense the 'perfectionism', Kidman and  Cruise took big career risks with this film and I think it paid off. As  usual with Kubrick; great cinematography, lighting, score and atmosphere.  Great performances by almost all the cast, a little mis-casting may have  hurt the film a bit. The film possesses a provocative subject matter that  raises questions that are mostly left unanswered, but maybe it's better  that way. Great for Kubrick fans, if you can not appreciate this film than  you didn't really understand Kubrick. A worthy final chapter in the life of  a genious. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!
$review_summary.: A great collaboration from Kubrick, Cruise and Kidman!

$REVIEW.: I like all kinds of movies so I'm not always set on just one genre.  I found Apocalypse Now excellent.  It's not a war movie where you see all the war grounds fighting or anything.  It's behind the scenes about what really did go on sometimes in vietnam (setting up to kill commanders)  The music in the background fits the time perfectly and Francis Ford Coppola is excellent.  Now with the new Redux version you get even more footage of the movie.
$SUMMARY.: What a great movie is

$review_text.: If the weather is bad and you can't get out then this is an okay time waster, but do not pay more than $2 for it.  The film is murky and the action is fair.  You can tell this is not a high budget movie because the opening scenes are done in the dark and not lit well.  This is to hide the lack of budget.  When the movie goes to the Bahamas, the action picks up and we have a cheap car chase.  Prices are cheaper  here so they can film in the day, but it is still muted colors. There is gun play but no shots of the bullets hiting anyone, that would cost money.  There is a "sex" scene but no nudity[damn it].  However this was filmed in a strange way, you see the main cahracter lost her husband about two days before and now she is going to bed with a stranger.  All this is happening while she is remembering how her husband died.  There is nothing new here in the way of plot and the acting is not bad, so it it an okay movie.  Nothing more, nothing less.  So if you have $2 and time to waste be my guest.
$SUMMARY.: a good $2 trashy movie

$REVIEW.: The art and music of this movie are really objectionable. The bridge is very cluttered and old-fashioned looking, clearly infected by &quot;Enterprise&quot; art concepts, leading one to believe that the technology of Picard's time has actually gone backward! I love &quot;Enterprise&quot; for what it is: a nostalgic look at the old days. But completely inappropriate to let the art direction of that series have such influence here.The music in the beginning is cheaply melodramatic and really grates.The overall effect is one of a show that has sacrificed the smooth, high-tech appearance that we have come to know as &quot;Next Gen&quot; in favor of an appearance that was out-of-date when Kirk was alive. Bad move.The plot is inherently good, but poorly executed. Both the location of the final battle and the way it ends lack meaning. Having said that, the battle itself is quite interesting. Also, the lines given to the Romulan commander at the end of this movie are so inappropriately saccharine and phony as to defy belief.It is also both true and sad that, as another reviewer noted, the ending of this movie completely invalidates the ending of the TV series, which ending was a vastly superior piece of work.Final conclusion: go ahead and buy it for the extras, but the movie will disappoint. Too much &quot;Enterprise&quot;, not enough &quot;Next Gen&quot;.

$REVIEW.: "Adventures of the Gummi Bears" is about a group of bears (believed to exist only in the imagination) that attempts to right any wrong doings. Most of the episodes are about the gummi bears fighting Duke Igthorn and his band of ogres who attempt to take over Dunwyn castle.  They do so with the help of their human friends Cavin and Cala.  I used to watch this as a kid and loved the humor and storylines of each episode.  Even as an adult, I still find the series very enjoyable.The DVD set contains 47 episodes.  The footage does not appear to be digitally restored and there are no special features included, but for the price that is being charged, these DVDs are well worth it.

It is truly a bleak, gloomy movie, and once it stops it never leaves your mind.

$review_text.: Rear Window directed by Alfred Hitchcock (Shadow of a doubt, Marnie, Psycho) is one of his most respected films. Practically his first cinematic landmark shot in color, REAR WINDOW is a scary, quality film. A man suspects his neigbor GETS IN AN ARGUMENT WITH A WOMAN (HIS WIFE) and they fight, the lights go out and a scream is heard. He killed her, right? Later in the film, when he sends his girlfriend to go in the house for clues as the supposed killer leaves, the girlfriend (Grace Kelly) gets trapped as the attacker rushes back home, he finds her and grabs her, shutting off the lights, a shreik is heard, you see the girl moving, struggling from the attacker's grip. The boyfriend calls the police, he has a broken leg and can't move, help or do anything but hope they come on time. The scene where the attacker finds out his girlfriend was the one who spied on him, the attacker comes to kill him, who will survive in this suspenseful classic that holds grip, romance, drama, suspense and mystery until the final shot.
$SUMMARY.: One of the greatest movies ever made. I'll tell you why...

$review_text.: Rat (Steve Barron, 2000)Not at all what I was expecting, I must say
Rat is billed as a family comedy, but I'm not sure that either "family" or "comedy" is an accurate assessment here

It's got humor, certainly, but it's the blackest of humors
And I'd have thought this a decidedly adult comedy, not because there's all that much content that's inappropriate for the kiddies, but because the way it's approached is a bit on the subtle side; I'm not sure the kiddies would find it interesting enough
As an adult black comedy, however, it's worth your time.Hubert (Pete Postlethwaite) is a typical guy; he's not terribly happy in his marriage, his job is less than fulfilling, and he likes the odd pint at the end of the day


He comes home from the pub one night, just as every other night, goes to bed, and when he wakes up in the morning, he's a rat
Needless to say, his wife Conchita (Imelda Staunton) is less than pleased


The news spreads, and eventually the entire town knows

A family discussion leads to a possible solution, but whose best interest is it in, ultimately?Wesley Burrowes (Mystics) is known for his black comedies, and Rat is no exception to the rule


Barron (Electric Dreams) usually works in more mainstream comedies, but he was a fine choice to helm this; he gets good performances out of the entire cast, he adapts well to the darker tone of the material, and the finished product is well-paced and watchable
Send the kiddies to bed and watch this one by yourselves

$REVIEW.: In the pantheon of frozen monster comedies, "Mammoth" is one of the most outlandish. The film is played straight, but amazingly while the extras allude to it providing a bit of humor, they also claim it's scary. They got that half right. The film opens with one of the most ridiculous fake science scenes in history (or since the 1950s, anyway,) and rapidly progresses to an even more ludicrous credit sequence. Vincent Ventresca plays annoying Dr. Frank Abernathy, a scatterbrained Mammoth scientist who can't get his personal life in order.  Summer Glau plays his petulant daughter Jack, whose sixteenth birthday is one to remember, while the generally talented Tom Skerritt entertainingly plays his UFO and conspiracy-crazed father, Simon.The film can't seem to make up its mind if it's a spoof or not, but it can't be taken seriously as anything else. To crank the plot up, a meteor streaks across the sky and hits the mammoth that's preserved in a giant ice cube in the town of Blackwater, Louisiana. How a small, backwards town got such an impressive natural history museum is left to your imagination. What you'll wish was left to your imagination are the special effects, which are beyond laughable. You will be surprised (or not) to see the mammoth come to life and escape, but not before sucking the life force out of the janitor in a unique trunk-to-nose spectacle. (Think "Ghostbusters" but infinitely less scary.)Frank arrives home and is mad at his dad for giving Jack his old VW Bug because he wanted to give her a hybrid. (Oh, please.) Jack is, of course, mad at her father for coming home late despite the fact that his museum just blew up and his mammoth just came back to life and escaped after a UFO landed on it. (Certainly taking your driving test is more important than that.) Government secret agents soon show up (of course) on direct orders of the President. (Ponder.) While this is the moment Skerritt knew was coming, the plot goes in seach of Jack who has escaped to the worst teen party ever filmed in the middle of a forest. It's inevitable that the party and escaped mammoth plotlines must converge, and indeed they do. After discovering that a Taser won't stop a mammoth, one of the agents loses his head while the other remains cool as a cucumber.The mammoth goes on a rampage and I am sad to report interrupts the most revolting automotive romance scene in film history. While backwoods Sheriff Marion Morrison (Charles Carroll) immediately grasps the enormity of the alien conspiracy, a guy in an ape suit enters and leaves the story quickly and pointlessly. The film makes clear that "the current administration" (that would be Bush, of course) will nuke the town if they don't get a handle on the mammoth-UFO co-conspirators quickly. Skerritt joins the pursuit and battle (I swear) outfitted in a welder's mask, and brandishing a mace and a garbage can lid as an improvised sword and shield. (You'd have thought a lifetime conspiracy nut would be better prepared.)All this leads to one of the singularly most amusing scenes in history. The town coroner and Sheriff Morrison let the rest of the cast on a secret: stored cryogenically in an official freezer ("Hands Off!") is a frozen human hand, formerly belonging to the coroner. That's not the good part. The hand, when microwaved on the popcorn setting, comes to life and uses American Sign Language to threaten the Earth. This scene is precious enough to earn the film three stars on its own for loopy humor. The agent gets it out of the oven with tongs, tazes it, then uses her Blackberry's tricorder app to scan the hand. Entertaining pontification ensues: "How do you explain the zombie soul-sucking effect?," and "Do you mean to say this is intergalactic OnStar?," or how about "We have an alien-possessed mammoth on the loose and if we don't stop it the government's going to kill all of us!"As a sweet sixteen gift after confronting "the hand goblin," Frank lets his daughter decide the fate of the world. Her decision is made easier when her boyfriend is impaled by a mammoth tusk, so they decide to lure the creature to a metal smelter. (No, really.) They first try pouring molten steel on him to no effect, but Skerritt shows up with a tanker truck of liquid nitrogen and they decide to flash freeze him instead. Sadly, in a cruel twist of fate Skerritt is also frozen in "a state of perfect hibernation," leaving the option of a sequel open with the obligatory "The End?"The DVD includes a modestly interesting "making of" feature. Glau has an extremely inflated opinion of the film, while Skerritt is notably less enthuiastic. Despite its occasional attempts at being a horror movie (a trait that is oddly emphasized in the extras) this really is more of a spoof, with elements from many earlier monster movies incorporated. The principal problem is that the characters (except loony Skerritt) are not likeable; combine that with a relative dearth of acting ability on the set, and a plot that wants to be all things to all people, "Mammoth" doesn't really succeed at doing anything well. It's enjoyable as single-viewing B-movie entertainment, but there are many better creature features and comedies out there.

$REVIEW.: This movie features a lot of murders a confusing plot and terrifying gun shot scenes.  Thankfully, the stars are Humphrey Bogart who plays a down to the nitty gritty private investigator and Lauren Bacall.  Who portrays a well-to-do girl who it turns out is trying to protect her sister.  Their chemistry is legendary and deservedly so.  Although, Humphrey Bogart as is noted several times in the movie, is not much to look at.  Lauren Bacall portrays class with ease.  It is intriguing and worth the while.

$REVIEW.: WWE is back with another Best Of compilation. This time it's WCW Clash Of The Champions. I just watched this set. I did not care for some of these as I was not a fan of WCW aside from a certain number of wrestlers. SO I skipped over some of the stuff and will review only what I saw.DISC 1Ric Flair vs. Sting - 03/27/88This took place at the first CLash Of The Champions event. If you are a big fan or a casual fan of any Sting persona, you should totally watch this match. I am not a fan of Ric Flair because I don't like his ring style. But this is one FLair match I was able to get through in it's entirety. Great showing by both legends here. This is the match that ended in a 45 minute draw.Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Lex Luger & Barry Windham - 03/27/88Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Sting & Dusty Rhodes - 06/08/88All four men really entertained me in this match. I expected Arn & Blanchard to make an excellent team since they were members of The Horsemen. But Dusty & Sting, two singles wrestlers also made a great team themselves.Ricky Morton vs. Ivan Koloff - 09/07/88Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk - 11/15/89Mil Mascaras vs. Cactus Jack Manson - 02/06/90One of the few matches I saw that did not contain Sting. After watching Mil's HOF Induction and him being talked about by Rey Mysterio in The Life Of A Masked Man , I was curious about him. After seeing this match, I am now a fan of his and wished I saw him back in the day. But there's always youtube for that.Midnight Express vs. Rock & Roll Express - 06/13/90Upon reading on JR's blog about this rivalry, I decided to check out a match between the two teams. This is a great tag bout. One of the best I've seen and I've seen many tag bouts in my lifetime. If WWE wants to revitalize their dead tag division, they could learn from this match.DISC 2To Be The Man, You Gotta Beat The ManRic Flair vs. Lex Luger - 09/05/90The Young Pistols & Z-Man vs. The Fabulous Freebirds - 06/12/9115-Man Battle Royal - 09/05/91Sting vs. Rick Rude - 11/19/91Tremendous one on one match here between two men who many, including me feel are worthy of a HOF Induction.Ric Flair & Arn Anderson vs. The Hollywood Blonds - 06/17/93I found this 2 Out of 3 Falls tag match entertaining. Three HOFers and one man who I feel will go in some day and that one man is Brian Pillman. Great showing here.Brian Pillman vs. "Stunning" Steve Austin - 11/10/93Five months after they teamed up, Austin & Pillman go one on one. A match I thoroughly enjoyed because I feel whenever you see two former partners go one on one, you know you'll get a good match because they know each other well from their tag teaming days. And when I say that, I mean legitimately well established tag teams and not two men who are thrown together and they go their separate ways a short time later.Lord Steven Regal vs. Dustin Rhodes - 01/27/94Sting & `Nature Boy' Ric Flair vs. Rick Rude & Vader - 01/27/94A fun and entertaining elimination tag match here. It was great seeing Flair team up with a man who he put on the map not too many years ago, Sting, an Icon in the making. I also enjoyed seeing Sting and Vader go at it because they had one of the best feuds in WCW.DISC 3Sting vs. `Nature Boy' Ric Flair - 06/23/94Five months after they team up, they face off again. This time, it's a Title Unification match. If you saw their other Clash Of The Champions match that's on this set, you'll know to expect something great.Steve Austin vs. Ricky Steamboat - 08/24/94Great match by these two HOFers. It was a great ride from start to finish.Hulk Hogan & `Macho Man' Randy Savage vs. `Nature Boy' Ric Flair & The Giant - 01/23/96I started to watch this and tried to get through it because Macho Man's one of my all time favorites. But skipped it after a while. Hogan & Savage, in my opinion were not the team they once were when they were The Mega Powers in the WWF.Medusa vs. Bull Nakano - 08/15/96Diamond Dallas Page vs. Eddie Guerrero - 08/15/96Clash of the Champions XXXIII - 15th August, 1996Harlem Heat vs. The Steiner Brothers vs. Sting & Lex Luger - 08/15/96One of the best Title matches on this set. Harlem Heat was comprised of Booker T & Stevie Ray who I believe are brothers in real life and two real life best friends in Luger & Sting. So this had the making of a great and entertaining tag team match for me. And after it was over, I felt I got just that.Ultimo Dragon vs. Dean Malenko - 01/21/97The Cruiserweight Division was the only division in WCW that I appreciated as they brought a lot to the organization and was one of the reasons I think WCW had the success that they did. I really love Dragon's work and I found this work in this match to be one of his best.WCW Cruiserweight Championship MatchChris Jericho vs. Eddie Guerrero - 08/21/97Long before they were main event stars and WOrld Champions in WWE, Jericho & Guerrero were a part of WCW's Cruiserweight division. Great match here by two men who should be on anyone's list of all time greats.Diamond Dallas Page & Lex Luger vs. Scott Hall & `Macho Man' Randy Savage - 08/21/97Blu Ray Exclusives:Ric Flair and Barry Windham vs. Midnight Express - 12/07/88Sting and Ricky `The Dragon' Steamboat vs. `Ravishing' Rick Rude and Steve Austin - 01/21/92Another great tag match on this set. If only WWE could put the quality of tag matches on this set in their tag matches to bring that division back to where it once was.Dustin Rhodes & Sting vs. Big Van Vader, Paul Orndorff and Barry Windham - 01/13/93I liked it. But this set has better Sting matches in my opinion. WIthout knowing much about WCW's history, I cannot tell if this match could be replaced by something better. But if I had to bet, I'd say yes. However, this match was not bad by any means.A great set. Worth the price.

$review_text.: "The Color Purple" is a film that tugs at your heart strings. Extremely emotional, the film received 11 Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture of 1985, and is widely considered the best film to document African/American issues. Taking place in the South, "The Color Purple" features the character of Celie, played brilliantly by Whoopie Goldberg in her screen debut, a woman being battered by her husband, the norm for black woman in the poor deep U.S. south in the early 1900's. Two woman eventually become close friends with Celie, giving her strength and power to overcome her abusive husband and to get on with her life. One of those friends is played by Oprah Winfrey (in an Osacr nominated performance) who plays Sophie. The role was actually offered to Tina Turner who turned down director Steven Spielberg's offer citing, "I already lived that life". The movie has an outstanding supporting cast including Danny Glover, Margaret Avery, and Adolph Caesar. Interviews with the cast are included with the DVD and much more. A perfect film that will remain in your memory forever.

A weathy (and dying) De La Guardia seeks the device after obtaining a manuscript with precise instructions on how to use it. It's another twist on the vampire theme. Boo.

$review_text.: *possible spoilers*It seems somehow appropriate that "The Lives of Others" should be set in 1984, since it takes us to a world where George Orwell's fictional Big Brother has become an all-too-real fact of everyday life.  The place is East Germany, five years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, where not just every action but virtually every thought can be surveyed and monitored by the secret police agency known as STASI.  As self-appointed "voices of the people," artists suffer an even more intense level of scrutiny than the average, everyday citizen.  As a result, many of them have either fled the country, committed suicide, or compromised their artistic vision in exchange for security and safety.  Georg Dreyman, a successful writer and dramatist, has chosen the latter course of action, towing the party line in his works better than most of his fellow artists.  Nevertheless, Wiesler, a security agent with STASI, suspects that Dreyman may not be quite the ideological purist Wiesler's fellow officers believe him to be (Wiesler may also be motivated by the fact that he is attracted to Dreyman`s beautiful girlfriend, a well-known stage actress named Christa-Marie Sieland, and, thus, has reasons of his own for wanting Dreyman out of the picture).  To confirm his suspicions, Wiesler has Dreyman's apartment bugged so that he and Sieland can be kept under surveillance twenty-four hours a day.  After awhile, however, Wiesler begins to soften in his stance towards Dreyman and, before long, he is betraying his own vows to the state by whitewashing his official reports on the writer.Within this historical context, "The Lives of Others" provides a chilling portrait of what life is like under a totalitarian regime.  It shows the dehumanization that occurs when freedom of thought and expression become anathema to a society, and the untenable paranoia that develops when one must live in constant fear of betrayal from stranger, acquaintance and loved-one alike.Interestingly, the two main characters in the film share very little screen time together, yet they are intricately linked in their roles of the observer and the observed.  Dreyman is a man willing to go along with a system he knows to be wrong, partly out of fear, but partly too out of a sincere belief that nothing he can do, even as an artist, will ever really change things.  It isn't until a close friend of his, a "blacklisted" theater director, decides to take his own life rather than to live with the oppression that Dreyman wakes up from his lethargy and takes a proactive stance against injustice.Wiesler has a less clearly defined moment of epiphany, and this strikes me as being one of the very few weaknesses of this otherwise extraordinarily fine film.  If Wiesler has a literary antecedent, it would have to be Guy Montag, the fire-starting protagonist in Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451."  Like Montag, Wiesler is a gung-ho advocate of a regressive regime, eagerly performing his duty of stamping out what he believes to be seditious and subversive elements that threaten the stability of the society.  But whereas Montag has his unmistakably paradigm-shifting moment while reading "David Copperfield," Wiesler has no comparable event to explain his 180-degree turnabout in outlook.  He just suddenly goes from being Dreyman's bitterest antagonist to his greatest protector and champion without a whole lot of explanatory detail to go along with the change.  It's difficult for us to accept the fact that a man would suddenly turn his back on everything he's dedicated his life to without at least a vaguely articulated reason for doing so.As Wiesler, the late great actor, Ulrich Muhe, leaves an indelible mark in his portrayal of a man whose cold, emotionless surface may be more the product of his environment than a reflection of the true man at the core of his being.  In a largely nonverbal role, Muhe is forced to convey much of his character's thoughts, feelings and emotions through his piercing eyes and tightly pursed lips.  Sebastian Koch brings a remarkable subtlety to the role of the writer, while Martina Gedeck as his girlfriend, and Ulrich Tukur as Wiesler's hardnosed superior deliver excellent performances as well.In her filmmaking debut, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck brings both a stunning attention to detail and a strong sense of atmosphere to her work.  Given the repressive environment she is portraying, Donnersmarck wisely holds back on delivering grand sentimental gestures for most of the film - which makes the climactic moments all the more heart-wrenching and devastating when they finally arrive.In this age of ramped-up fear and paranoia - and the increased scrutiny and surveillance that come along with them - "The Lives of Others" serves as a stark reminder of the things we lose when we give up our freedoms.

$REVIEW.: The best of the specials starring David Tennant - and I say that even having absolutely loved the last fifteen minutes or so of "The End of Time, Part 2." As a complete experience, however, this episode is tops.The storyline is, as others have noted, rather bleak for a Doctor Who episode in that it shows more than one of the Doctor's darker qualities, and because the ending suggests that even the Doctor can't save everyone. And yet the darker elements make sense - both in terms of plot and character. Those grayer shadings have always been in the Doctor's character; it's just that this one time, they come to the forefront in a controlled way that may throw some viewers. But let's not overstate the case here - this is still Who, is still relatively family friendly, and is still soundly entertaining.

$REVIEW.: I've heard that to get a film made in Hollywood these days you need a big name star and to be able to define your project in terms of other successful movies. To that end, here we have Liam Neeson in a `melange a trois' of David Fincher's THE GAME (the score is even quoted in places) and BOURNE TRILOGY with a bit of Polanski's FRANTIC thrown in for good measure.Despite that the result is decidedly average. It's certainly intriguing to begin with and there are a couple of genuinely tense scenes (the bit with the scissors in particular had me on the edge of my seat). Ultimately, however, the plot relies of a series of implausibilities (would Harris really rush back to the airport without uttering a single word to his wife?) and I found the denouement unsatisfying.There's also a rather gratuitous sex-in-the-shower scene that's repeated like a motif throughout. And do we really need to see Liam Neeson with a wife who is so much younger?Finally, if you know Berlin well you'll be utterly bemused by the continuity and how the film jumps around locations seemingly at random. There's no obvious reason for this, especially in the opening scene as the car appears to teleport back and forth along 17 Juni Strasse.Having said all that, it was passable entertainment for a Saturday night if you're looking for a vaguely intelligent thriller.

$review_text.: "Insidious" went on to become one (really wanted to say "Wan" instead of "one" here) of the most profitable films of 2011 and one of the most talked about horror films of the past few years despite having such a small budget. Most people seemed to really enjoy it, but its extremely loud music and repetitive use of cheap and jump out scares became tiresome overall. Now, two years later, "Insidious: Chapter 2" has been released and director James Wan swears it's his swan song to the horror genre. If that's the case, then Wan really should have stepped out of the game with "The Conjuring."Like its predecessor, the most intriguing segments of "Insidious: Chapter 2" take place in The Further. The music isn't nearly as obnoxious this time around. In fact, other than the music used with the title card and closing credits, the score of the film is much more subdued otherwise. The moments of complete silence are still there, but the music is much more restrained, softer, and less "in your face," which is a very gratifying alteration.The scenes that take place in The Further are the creepiest aside from the closet sequence with Dalton and a tin can telephone. The manner in which "Insidious: Chapter 2" connects to the first film is more complicated and interesting than you're initially lead to believe. Patrick Wilson's performance seems a little rough at first, but evolves into this enigma that's much more spellbinding. He's extremely off-putting at times and yet you're mesmerized by the duress that Josh is being put through.The original was a little slow at times, but the sequel feels like it takes an even longer amount of time to get things rolling. Events like the piano playing itself, baby toys going off on their own, strange women walking the halls, and a baby monitor being used like a lifeline are all that awaits you in the first half of the film. The importance of the sound of a metronome or hearing a clock tick in the background is intriguing, but isn't enough to really immerse the audience in a return to this world.Poor Rose Byrne seems to have returned just to get the crap beaten out of her for the sequel. She gets the hell slapped out of her by a poltergeist, has a teapot thrown at her back at full force by a grown man, and gets thrown across the room. "Insidious: Chapter 2" is much more comedic in comparison to the original. Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) are nothing but pure comedic relief with their hunter-ninja-bear game, the quesadilla/unicorn code word argument, and the entire tranquilizer sequence. The ending is predictable sequel bait that seems thrown in just to keep the franchise going after Wan's exit. Don't expect any answers after the credits either because there's nothing there."Insidious: Chapter 2" has a slower pace and a lighter, goofier tone than the original film. The jump-out scares have been tucked away and are more methodical in execution. However the sequel will likely not be as much of a crowd-pleaser as "Insidious." There's no doubt "Insidious: Chapter 2" will be profitable. It'll likely take first place opening weekend and be successful based on the positive reputation of the first film alone, but the sequel will more than likely be seen as a disappointment that doesn't live up to its predecessor.
$SUMMARY.: Just ignore it and it'll go away

$review_text.: Hollywood could never pull off a movie this hard to define.  Set in Buenos Aires, it stars British Colin Firth, whom everyone is seeing stars over due to the new Bridget Jones film, and American Hart Bochner, the definition of attractive leading man if there ever was one.  We need more movies with Hart Bochner's face filling the screen!  When he rescues the cat on the ledge, it is movie-making magic.  Bochner is a mysterious character who shows up and is taken in by Firth.  While the film's ending is quite unexpected and, frankly, a little on the weird side, the flow of this film is gorgeous, careening between humanistic character study and slightly gory crime scenes. At its core, it's about a male friendship between two men who are unstable in different ways -- fascinating to watch.  Why more people haven't seen this movie, I have no idea ....

$review_text.: "The American"(2010) is directed by Anton Corbijn (Control). The film is an adaptation of the 1980 novel "A Very Private Gentleman" by Martin Booth. George Clooney(Jack) portrays an assassin who is also a custom arms dealer who flees to Italy in the mountains of Abruzzo. The movie is reminiscent of Antonioni's film "The Passenger" (1975) in its slow pace, feeling of alienation and spiral to a place where death waits. Jack is in hiding but is also extremely exposed being the lone American in the small Italian town of Castel del Monte. The town is a labyrinth which both conceals and traps Jack. He is always looking over his shoulder as he is continues to be pursued by assassins. What unfolds very gradually is his changing outlook on life, and his future possibilities when he befriends another foreigner, Clara (Violante Placido), who's a prostitute. The film reads more like an existential film, than a typical thriller of cat and mouse, as it focuses on the life a man has chosen that leads him essentially to a dead end with little chance of escape.

$REVIEW.: I am not a big Ryan Reynolds fan.  Prior to THE PROPOSAL, I  had never seen anything he'd done before that left any kind of impression on me.  My wife was the same way..."have we seen him in anything before?"  Bland (even wooden), usually in dreadful films like WAITING, or in utterly forgettable roles such as in WOLVERINE.Sandra Bullock is a past-master of the romantic comedy.  She can give "smart*ss" and she can do "sweet" in the same movie.  She doesn't really create believable people as much as delightful screen personas.  Lately, though, she's clearly been fighting her age...trying to pull off roles that were too "young" for her.  I don't know if it's her or her plastic surgery, but she has tended to mostly look vaguely angry...and her makeup is usually VERY harsh these days.So I was primed not to care very much for THE PROPOSAL.  And as a whole, it is a very predictable, by-the-numbers romantic comedy of the "they hate each other right up until the last second" ilk.  But there were just a few scenes that popped with excellent timing, set-up and execution that had me laughing hard...so despite my better inclinations, I'm actually giving this movie a fairly solid recommendation.  For what it attempts and accomplishes.If you haven't seen the trailer:  Bullock plays a tough-as-nails book editor who has no life beyond work.  She is feared by everyone in the office, because she is ruthless and apparently very good.  She also bullies her assistant (Reynolds), making him work nights & weekends, and forcing him to run all kinds of errands that are certainly beneath his title.  One day, this Canadian finds that she has been ignoring her immigration attorney for too long, and she is about to be deported.  She will lose her position (for a year) to a man she just fired.  Just as she is absorbing this news, in walks Reynolds.  And Bullock hits upon the brilliant idea to announce to her bosses that she and Reynolds are about to be married, thus securing her place in the US.INS is understandably skeptical, so for reasons that  really don't make a lot of sense, Bullock & Reynolds feel they must immediately fly to Alaska to meet Reynolds' family and old friends.  It's the typical "fish out of water" scenario, with Bullock trying to walk in stiletto heels through a tiny Alaskan fishing town.  Or trying to cope with her fear of boats.  Or trying to get along with the family dog when she hates dogs.  NO surprises.  The plot chugs along predictably to an ending that doesn't surprise at all.Yet, as I said, this film has its wonderful comic moments.  In fact, what may be the best scene comes fairly early.  When Bullock announces her intent to marry Reynolds, he has had no time to prepare.  It hits him by surprise.  And his reaction shots are perfect.  He knows that everyone is in on something, and that he must cover as best he can.  Yet he also has a glimmer of the ridiculous notion Bullock has just tossed on him...that they are in love and engaged.  He's mortified, but wants to be professional.  He wants to deny it, but instinct tells him not to thwart his terrifying boss.  I can't adequately describe it...somehow, Reynolds had a moment  heretofore unachieved by him as a performer.  It's enough to make you like his character from that point on.Other moments nearly as good pop up from time to time.  When the two  have an unwanted "nude collision."  A silly incident with Bullock, the dog, an eagle and a cell phone!The movie has the required "serious" moments too, such as when we discover why Bullock is so uptight and unfriendly.  These scenes only work because the two stars have earned our goodwill in the comedic scenes...otherwise the somber moments would be unbearable.The supporting cast is mostly window-dressing.  Poor Mary Steenburgen, who is a great actress, is relegated yet again to an unfunny role as "mother."  Craig T. Nelson looks like a coach  gone to seed, and isn't very happy about it, as "father."  Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN) has a thankless role as a former girlfriend.  Oscar Nunez (TV's "The Office") shows up in a crazy role (I won't spoil what it is) that gets some laughs, but in tone, belongs to another film. But the remarkable Betty White is there to shake things up as Reynolds' grandmother.  She's playing a character too over-the-top to be convincing...but she does it with such comic verve that you can't help but like her.  She's 87 years old (doesn't look it at all) and has not lost one moment of her comic timing.  Whoever had the idea to cast her should get 25% of the profits of this film! (On the other end of the spectrum is Denis O'Hare, usually a reliable character actor in both dramas and comedies, who shows up as the suspicious INS agent...and brings a tin ear to his dialogue that makes virtually every utterance supremely unfunny.  He's trying to make a part that doesn't actually have any laughs into something it is not.)It was amusing that the movie takes place mostly in Alaska.  It was certainly a beautiful location, but you have to think that the driving decision behind that somehow relates to the attention Sarah Palin brought to the state.  Can't you just see a bunch of "suits" patting themselves on the back for their timeliness?In the end, THE PROPOSAL is a predictable romantic comedy.  I enjoyed myself, and I can even envision watching the film again some day on DVD with my daughter and her friends, perhaps.  It doesn't make me put Reynolds on my list of favorites...but he sure scored a lot of points with me.  Bullock gets a reprieve.  Betty White gets an MVP award.  And I got to laugh a lot more than I would have expected.  I think for the clich&eacute; heavy genre that it's in...I must actually give the film 4 stars!!
$SUMMARY.: Actually a lot funnier than I could ever have expected.

$REVIEW.: Here it is, the beginning of the Red Dwarf universe (aptly titled &quot;The End&quot;), the beginning of some truly wild times. The first  season was a little clumsy, new to the actors, and certainly underbudgeted,  but it was the start of something wonderful, and contained glimpses of that  wonder as well.The End is really good, particularly for a pilot episode.  The premise of the show is complete. Dave Lister emerges from stasis 3  million years into the future. He is alone in deep space with the computer  Holly, the hologram Arnold Rimmer, and The Cat, a humanoid evolved from  domestic household cats. This episode is a necessity for anyone trying to  grasp the full picture of Red Dwarf.Future Echoes is the finest of the  first season. When the crew travels faster than light speed they catch  glimpses of actions they have yet to do. Lister decides not to return to  stasis and Rimmer whines a fair amount about being dead.Balance of Power  has always irritated me as it is inconsistent with Red Dwarf episodes to  come. Lister complains about never having asked Kochanski for a date, but  by the fourth season she is referred to as his ex-girlfriend. I suppose I  shouldn't blame this episode itself, which contains a great scene in which  Rimmer is saddled with Olaf Peterson's arm, but I can't help it...If a  crazy, whacked-out British Sci-fi comedy that specializes in the rampant  use of the word &quot;Smeg&quot; sounds right up your alley, than check out  Red Dwarf! It's brilliant!

$review_text.: I watched this movie with expectations of it being mediocre but I was surprised. Some parts of the movie are quite funny and you will absolutely want to take Chilly Christmas (the dog's name) home with you forever. The rest of the characters are also quite endearing, although I found myself thinking Tom Arnold made somewhat of a lackluster villian.The basic plot is that a boy, Bobby, (maybe 10?) and his father live in what I believe is the small, fictitous town of Sunshine Beach, California. Somewhere along the line dad (an above average police detective with a stellar apprehension rate) has become a widower (mom was also a police officer) and he and his son are clearly still trying to cope with the loss even though you get the idea it has been a while since mom's passing. The story opens on Bobby at the Christmas tree opening his presents. Except the puppy he was to receive has escaped and a chase around the Christmas tree ensues. The dog becomes Chilly Christmas (the breed is supposed a rare Koren one but my household suspects Chilly is actually an otterhound) and Chilly does not believe in discipline. One year later we find, like every other silly dog movie, Chilly destroys most everything he gets near. This becomes problematic when Bobby's dad is asked to join the FBI to head a task force in New York, where Chilly will have no wide open backyard to frollick and dad fears he will destroy the apartment. Meanwhile, multiple kennels and pet stores are being broken into with valuable rare dogs being stolen for some nefarious purpose never revealed other than the kidnappers are set to make lots of money. Naturally when dad puts Chilly, this rare dog breed, on an adoption website, the dog nappers close in and try to steal him. This is all unbeknownst to Bobby, who is trying train Chilly to become an indoor dog with the help of his friends Kizzy (a tomboy) and an absolutely great little boy named Caps (explained in the film, he was my favorite character). Eventually the police, including Bobby's dad, figure out who the dog nappers are but it is Bobby who saves the day and Chilly.The plot is predictable but most movies like this are. However, the writing for this movie is good, the acting is not too bad and Chilly is so cute! The good thing about this movie is you can watch it with young children. The villian is hardly even worth a gasp let alone frightening and the hijinks will keep little ones amused. Dog lovers will like watching the struggles with Chilly and the unorthodox training methods used to make him an indoor dog. This may not be an annual watching like some other holiday classics but it is good enough to add to your Christmas movie collection and watch on some wintery weather day where you just want a good movie and a cup of hot chocolate. Highly recommend.

$REVIEW.: This is a movie about the world of Lobbyists and the life of "spinning"

 A note up front, you have to keep an open mind with this movie

This movie was actually very funny and pointed out a number of thing that I think we all realize but never verbalize


 This is based in the late 90's prior to the tobacco settlement, the main character is a Lobbyist for the tobbacco industry

 It explores his job and his life and why he did the job


Many people write him off as a murderer, but this movie adresses this and more

 Throw in his dinner meetings with his Lobbyist friends from Alcohol and Firearms, I would not have thought i could laugh at the movie, but I did

The movie was well written, great voiceovers where needed, and dialog flowed well


 The movie is best summed up by one of the lines "you have to pay the mortgage"


 So if you want a thinking comedy, and don't mind some dark humor on occasion, i think this is worth a viewing.

$review_text.: Maybe after coming off the Super bowl high of watching Tom Brady and the Patriots win for the second time in three years I was expecting more from "Any Given Sunday." Everything seemed to line up - the cast, with Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid and James Woods; the director and writer Oliver Stone; the concept, a behind the scenes look at the NFL under the fictional guise of the American Football Association
Unfortunately, all these promising pieces added up to a nothing more than every sports clich&eacute; in the past thirty years of filmmaking crammed into one movie.The story is really Pacino's, as the aging Coach of the Miami Sharks (clever twist in the Dolphins, huh?) facing the challenges of a changing league

His owner has recently died, leaving the unbelievably obnoxious Diaz as the current Owner, always breathing down his neck and forcing her uninformed will upon him
Owner is concerned with television ratings, possibly moving the franchise - tons of other motives other than winning games


Coach is also trying to manage Foxx as the Young Hot Shot


Young Hot Shot has recently come on the scene when the Old Star (Quaid) was injured

Coach and Old Star are of course very close and belong to the same philosophy, but Young Hot Shot is taking over the game with every play, ignoring Coach's plays and doing his own play-calling - but succeeding

So Coach has a dilemma - when the playoffs start does he go with Young Hot Shot, who the cameras (and Owner) love, or with the tried and true methods of Old Star?Well, Young Hot Shot has isolated himself from the rest of the team with his brash comments and rise to a household name (in all of about three games)


So Coach goes with the unconfident Old Star in the first game of the playoffs

But all the while Young Hot Shot has been learning his lesson, quietly nodding in understanding during Coach's rousing halftime speeches


So when the time comes and Old Star is again injured, Young Hot Shot is ready to step in

By this time, though, Coach has accepted Young Hot Shot's unruly methods and allows him to just go for it, and they of course, win the game.Sound familiar? It should


It's the plot of about every sports film ever made


We don't even need actual names to describe it
I expected so much more from Stone


In an attempt to show what pro sports is  "really" like, he apparently thought the story wouldn't matter
We focus on almost everything but football - the egos of the characters, the ulterior motives of the owner, the inaccurate news reporting - but not football


The games are reduced to darkened, rainy war scenes, with people loosing eyes (literally), front flips over defenders, and someone getting injured on almost every play.Whether or not football is actually the way Stone depicts it, he did not paint a convincing picture whatsoever


Essentially, the owner cares *nothing* for the players, the coaches clear players to play when they are one hit away from having an aneurism, and the players intentionally don't block on the front line because they don't like their quarterback


Sorry

I don't buy it


Stone paints the league as a dark, depressing, unforgiving torture chamber, with games no more sophisticated than a fourth-grade scramble in the park


Football is the most complex game on the planet - why not show even a little bit of that? Instead of the Carolina Panthers and New England Patriots - who chose to have themselves introduced as a team rather than individuals - we get the tough to swallow Miami Sharks, who all *hate* each other

A team like this would never make the playoffs - never

And then, to make it even worse, all of this is thrown together in a horrendous MTV-style montage

The movie is edited like a commercial - it just feels like a collection of scenes, not a movie.I do not recommend this film, especially if you love football and are hoping for a good sports movie
It's a war film in the costume of a sports film, and apparently Stone doesn't think the audience is intelligent enough to understand this for themselves, because he includes scene after scene of gladiators fighting in the coliseum, ramming the analogy down the viewer's throat
He should stick to the war/crime movies, and stop trying to impose the genre on innocent films.

$review_text.: "Boss" is loosely based on the great 20th century mayors of Chicago who ran the Windy City with a mixture of power, political acumen, and (dare we say it) an honest wish for the success of the city (that is, as long as all three could be simultaneously achieved)
As we watch the story of "Boss" unfold over two seasons, we see a powerful Chicago mayor (Mayor Kane) as he keeps an iron fist over what he has achieved over the years in coming up the ranks of the Chicago system, and doing so while he wrestles with a serious physical illness


Although endowing the character with this illness is the twist in the story that makes it different from the city's actual mayoral history, anyone who grew up in Chicago instantly recognizes the reference (as does any reader of Mike Royko's columns in the Chicago Tribune published over those years), a steely parallel between the role and the reality: it's like dirty street fighting waged in men's dress suits
Anyone raised in the Chicago area, too, recognizes all the details: the types of clothing, the names of towns throughout the state, the hairstyles, even the styles of glasses

Of course, there were no smart phones in those years, but this is a modern telling of a slightly older story

Somebody really got this right in both execution AND detail.Fans of Boss were greatly excited to see the second season of this critically acclaimed show (Grammer won a Golden Globe for best dramatic performance in Season One), and, for the most part, Season Two does not disappoint


We can easily say again what we said after watching Season One of Boss: this is Grammer's greatest role to date, and demonstrates that his acting skills cover drama, not only comedy (as we saw in 11 years of Frasier)


Grammer won four Emmy's for his work in Frasier, and, I believe, was nominated for even more, so it's a high bar to pass, but fans of Boss know that something very impressive is occurring in Grammer's portrayal of this role, something that had not happened even in a show as strong as Frasier


I said it after watching Season One of Boss, and I'll say it here again: Grammer is so good in this role that it is SCARY.Grammer has said that "Boss" is not really about politics, but rather about the craving for power


Although I can see the argument, it's really difficult to untangle the two in this setting
But that is irrelevant


Boss takes you in and drops you off into this world of political machinations, power politics, dirty campaigning, and even municipal operations (we see almost as much of the city alderman and ward bosses as we do "the Boss" himself) to the point where this could be more Machiavelli than Royko, and anyone who is interested in how political wheelings and dealings occur in such a setting will almost certainly be fascinated


We see how the Boss faces every challenge, defies every obstacle, and navigates through (and between) deceit, both personal and political, to keep himself where he wishes to be, at the reins of this most central of cities.A small criticism of Season Two of "Boss" has been that some of the story lines become a bit more extravagant and difficult believe when compared to Season One
That may be partially true, but it's not a big concern
It is true that the first season stayed within a somewhat more constrained story line and that the second tends to open up multiple simultaneous lines


Some of Season Two can be a bit difficult to follow because of that very fact, and that's why purchasing this on disk is helpful, because you may very well need to watch the show twice to pick up all the twists and outcomes
But after watching Season One and have started Season Two, you'll likely be hanging on every scene to see how the stories play out
But the overarching story line is a somewhat unusual premise, a city boss with a terrible illness and a city to keep in his pocket while he keeps himself together
And Grammer does it superbly: this is certainly his best work to date, and you find yourself being drawn into the story because of the commanding performance he elicits
The excellent performances of nearly everyone makes it a great ensemble cast.There is really no reason to watch Season Two before Season One, and, in reality, due to the complexities built into the story, Season Two will not really make a whole lot of sense without having first watched Season One


Both seasons are out on Blu-Ray and DVD, so pick up Season One first, and work through those eight episodes, and then come to Season Two (ten episodes)


If you have a Blu-Ray player and a HD television, you'll see Chicago glisten in many of the shots

It's really a unique city that is almost always overshadowed by its noisier competitors on both the east and west coasts (and due to the Midwesterner's subdued demeanor) but nevertheless holds its own special beauty.Boss

It's engrossing, powerful, challenging
It's unusual

It's educating, in some strange way


It sports a superb cast, excellent production values, and doesn't insult the viewer by dumbing anything down


You'll be angry at the end of Season Two that a third season was not made, but don't let that deter you


There's really no way to rate this show as anything less than five stars.See also:Boss: Season One [Blu-ray]

$review_text.: MOVIE RATING:  3.5 starsDirector Thomas McCarthy's latest film, Win Win (2011) follows in the "youth" sports movie footsteps of such classics as Hoosiers (1986), Rudy (1993), The Karate Kid (1984), Peaceful Warrior (2006), and Remember The Titans (2000), not to mention several other sports-themed movies that would love to be in that group of classics. Win Win lands on the fence in my opinion...on the cusp of being included with the great sports movies. It probably just needs some time and repeated viewings to be fully appreciated. I saw the film back in the Spring of 2011 when it was still in the theaters. And I definitely want to catch it again on blu-ray. Win Win is a very good film, but it does fall prey to some typical cliches for the genre that I feel have been done enough and in better movies. So while Win Win was good, it wasn't as fresh as I would've liked it to be.Paul Giamatti is excellent as always, delivering a typical quirky performance that he is so well known for. The real surprise here is the hilarious and awesome best friend character played by Bobby Cannavale. Together, these 2 guys generate most of the laughs in the film. But supporting roles by Amy Ryan, Jeffrey Tambor, and Burt Young also shine. The real win in Win Win is the writing in McCarthy's screenplay. The dialogue is superb and the story generally satisfies in all the typical ways we've come to expect from sports movies. I only wish there was something new to grab on to. All the typical events that happen in these genre films happen here. There well done...yes. But too familiar to shine above those that came before.The production design, cinematography, sound, music, and editing are all well executed in Win Win. I saw this movie projected on 35mm film, and it did look a bit muddy on the big screen, but I have a feeling the HD presentation on the blu-ray is much better. You really can't go wrong with giving Win Win a watch. Even though it is a bit predictable, it's a fun, well-acted and enjoyable movie.

$REVIEW.: I loved "The Calamari Wrestler" from the moment the giant squid stepped into the ring and counters Koji Taguchi's signature Reverse-Inverted Full Nelson with a Northern Light Suplex to win the championship, shattering Koji's dreams, and making his fianc&eacute;e Miyako (Kana Ishida) cry. As Miyako ponders where she's seen that squid before, the trippy title sequence and theme music cries "Ika, Ika, Ika!" which is Japanese for "Squid, Squid, Squid!"Shortly after the credits we see the squid meditating at the temple, and find him to be a very peaceful creature outside the ring. We learn that Miyako used to date and still longs for the great wrestling champion Kanichi Iwata (Osamu Nishimura,) who contracted a rare disease. She believes him lost, but he actually went to Pakistan and became a giant squid as part of his life-restoring therapy. She suspiciously notes that the squid likes to eat red bean rice cakes with citrus dumplings, and recalls that those were Iwata's favorites. The squid tells Miyako that Kanichi is dead, but she quickly comes to terms with his simply having become a giant squid and falls in love with him all over again. The delicately framed shots of the squid stalking the countryside at sunset are beyond great, and when they walk hand-in-tentacle, the shots are even better. The two still clearly love each other, but it can be very dangerous for Kanichi to get too close to her. Despite the hazards, they dance in a park to celebrate, and finally Miyako tempts Kanichi too much, making him return to his human form, which makes him gravely ill. He returns to the temple to become a giant squid again, but it is extremely challenging.Koji is so upset at his professional setback at the tentacles of a squid, he goes to Pakistan to train and comes back a cherry red octopus. Battle "Cephalopoda" is on! The giant cephalopod costumes are absolutely wonderful, and the characterizations the actors give their tentacled characters are likewise perfect. The rematch is an amazing piece of athletic theater (more so than most wrestling, even) with not only a giant squid and giant octopus vying for the title, but a final surprise that is truly original and very amusing. I won't spoil the conclusion, but will just say two words: Squilla Boxer. (You'll see.)"The Calamari Wrestler" is part Japanese monster movie, part wrestling satire (I can't imagine that director Minoru Kawasaki hasn't seen "Rocky,") part love story, and bits and pieces of lots of other things. I loved everything about it from the subtle nuances of how the squid carried his shopping cart so properly while on an outing to buy bread and sardines (he politely gives back change when the shopkeeper gives him too much money back,) to the scene where he wears sunglasses in an attempt to disguise his identity. This is a squid to look up to, a role model for good citizenship and good sportsmanship everywhere, and I highly recommend "The Calamari Wrestler:" it is an utterly unique film, and is brilliant in concept and execution.The DVD has several extras, all of which are worth watching. First and foremost is an interesting "making of" feature, but there are also production stills, trailers, television spots, and even an extremely artsy music video about love and a giant wrestling squid. How could you not love this movie?

$review_text.: A movie like this goes a long way to show that experience counts for a lot  in acting business. What would normally have been a  nothing-out-of-the-ordinary funny movie is elevated to unusual height by  the excellent teamplay of the two leads, Martin and Hawn and Cless as the  crossdressing hotel manager. Without ever trying to steal each others show  they each contribute to what must rate as one of the most hiarious movies  ever made.  The story itself, elderly but still youthfull couple has  finally time for each other and they don't really know what to do now is  even preserved throughout the movie and doesn't get lost like it usually  does in comedies. And a continues flow of jokes keeps the pace to the very  end.

$REVIEW.: There is no denying that Phil Morrison's "Junebug" is raw, real and true. The film is free of the incessant emotional roller coaster that is common films made with lack of true feelings and the very emotion that it's reaching for as the sountrack purrs in the audiences ear signaling the cue for tears or laughter. By the time you've come to the unrealistically perfect end you've been told exactly what to feel regardless of your personal taste and views.Luckily great films are still occasionally made and "Junebug" has more life hiding in the dressing rooms than in many American films entire production. The film makers simply invite us to spend one weekend in the life of a family, and the climax is the entire film, every simple, straightforward frame of it.The film begins with Madeleine, an art dealer from Chicago, meeting George and they fall in love. Later, on a trip to North Carolina to meet up with an artist named David Wark, they stop by to visit George's family who live near their destination.George's family are an interesting bunch we learn for ourselves just before the couple arrives. Peg, his mother, is a strong and forward woman who maintains a nice house. Eugene, his father, is a withdrawn and kind man who spends his time in his wood shop in the basement. Johnny, George's brother, is also quiet but for different reasons as if afraid of what he might say or because he's to disenchanted to put together words. And Ashley, Johnny's sweet, innocent, relentlessly upbeat girlfriend. She is pregnant and longing for Johnny's appreciation and forming a bond with Madeleine, whom she's impatienly eager to meet.Upon Madeleine's meeting the family it's clear of the family's personality and intentions, she immediately admires them. She humors Ashley by staying up late and allowing her to paint her toenails. She gives her advice on the pregnancy and her relationship with the distant Johnny. She shares a quiet bond with Eugene who admires her good quality. She tries to help Johnny with studying for his GED exam. He mistakes her kindness and interest for affection, the kind he lacks with Ashley, which could be rooted to his fear and exitement of having a child.In the short time she knows these people she forms such a strong bond that when she finally has the chance to acquire David Wark's artwork she is forced to make a difficult decision to either meet with Wark or sacrifice the professional opportunity and be with the family at Ashley's side while she's giving labor.Ultimately she goes to meet Wark and Ashley loses the baby. Madeleine is crushed. Ashley is devastated. These are experiences real people go through; regret, loss, heartbreak and Morrison delivers these moments with brilliant honesty.There are many great moments in this film like the scene in the hospital with Ashley and George after she's lost the baby, the dialog is heartbreaking but not without hope, and not the hope forced onto characters in other films by just the right music on the soundtrack and the realization that the film is ending with the appropriate tone, but real hope from real people who are uncertain if tomorrow will be better but knowing that you just have to keep living any how.My favorite moment in the film is a scene during Ashley's baby shower. Johnny is sitting on the couch downstairs watching television when he comes upon a documentary on merecats, Ashley's favorite animal. He yells for her but she's engrossed in the party so he frantically hurries to find a tape to record the program. His actions are in vain though, he can not get it to record because the tab was removed. He gets angry and when Ashley comes down and explains his mistake he smashes the tape and goes back into depressive silence. Ashley says to him "God loves you just the way you are, but he loves you too much to let you stay that way"."Junebug" is a great film that ends the way it begins with the individuals living their lives, all of them seemily the same but somewhere deep inside, as with every human being, they have been affected by the events of their lives. The great films know that we don't need it spelled out for us.Thanks "Junebug".

$REVIEW.: Spoilers ahoy!Oh where to begin..


I've watched this show from beginning to end, and I have to say I like it

It's unlike anything else on television right now

If you likedThe 10th Kingdom,Shards Of The Glass Slipper: Queen Cinder, SyFy'sAlice (TV Miniseries),Ella Enchanted,Mirror Mirror, or any of the light to medium weight fairy tales retold, then Once Upon a Time is right up your alley


It's kind of a relief to watch after all these gritty, sometimes depressing and disturbingly violent shows likeGame of Thrones,Spartacus: Gods of the Arenaand Boardwalk Empire[Blu-ray].The format of the show may be difficult to follow, because the fairy tales are told out of sequence, as the parts told in our world happen in order

However, you could probably watch the episodes randomly and still understand what's going on
The premise is that Snow White's stepmother, The Evil Queen, has cursed all of Fairy Tale Land and transported them here, to a Maine town called Storybrooke


(Yes, seriously.) No one remembers who they are except for a select few, and time is at a standstill until The Chosen One arrives

Confusion may come when trying to remember all of the characters' names and/or titles
Regina/the mayor/the evil queen, is one example, but the stories are told in a way that eventually you know who's who.The show is written by some of the people from Lost, and apparently there are a lot of references to Lost on screen

I never watched Lost, so I can't comment on that


There are also many references to Disney both visually and in the plot, so that's kind of fun to see

Some people say this is family entertainment, but I have to disagree


I would be very uncomfortable explaining some of the plot points to young children


To be fair, the original Grimm tales are pretty grim as well, but this show uses Disney characters as a base

While Disney films have also had many questionable moments, I would not recommend this for the whole family.For one thing, Prince Charming/David/shepherd guy is married to King Midas' daughter/Princess Abigail/Katherine in this world
(Are you following all this?) He is cheating on her with Mary Margaret/Snow White/Princess Snow
Presented in context, it's understandable and even sympathetic, but they carry it too far

The pregnancy test drama simply piled onto the fact that David/Charming is a big dumb schmuck


In the finale, I was rooting for the dragon to win and for David to leave town.The worst thing about the show to me is the way adoption is portrayed

The themes seem to be adoptive parents' and children's worst nightmares
Emma is left at an orphanage as a baby and never gets a real family, bouncing around from foster home to foster home


Henry is Regina/mayor/evil queen's adopted son in, and from, this world

He keeps saying his mother is evil, and runs to his birth mother, Emma for help

Henry never shows any attachment to his adoptive mother, and Regina shows little true maternal instinct until the finale

Even then, it's too little too late
This is another thing the writers take too far when Emma threatens to take Henry away from Regina
The genre just isn't right for some of this stuff.Some religious groups will have a huge problem with nomenclature if they don't already shun the show because of magic


Emma is referred to as "the savior" throughout the series, and even begins to refer to herself this way in the finale

These are just a few of the awkward things about OUAT that would make me think twice about letting my kids watch

Your mileage will probably vary

You may not care, you may have mature kids who can handle the content-- I'm just telling you what's in there.Caveats aside, it's intriguing to watch character fairy tale back stories unfold, always in a way that relates to what is happening here and now
It's hard to understand how some of the events in our world could happen, unless you've heard director commentary on a 5-episode DVD that was available around Easter


They explain that time has kind of "stopped" in Storybrooke, which is why you see things that seem to be anachronisms and events that wouldn't seem likely these days

I don't think it's as obvious as they seem to think, at least not to me

As with all stories about time travel and manipulating time, I tend to go a bit cross-eyed


If time has stopped in Storybrooke, how did Henry age 10 years with no one noticing that no one else did? Maybe it's just magic, but sometimes it's hard to suspend disbelief.The plot is predictable at times, but is otherwise engaging
Regina and Mr
Gold/Rumplestiltkin are worth watching
It's not about police procedurals, doctors or lawyers

This show is very close to what I've been looking for-- something taken down a notch from all these shows that are too clever for their own good, something with characters, story and without the squick
It's something different and in my stomping grounds

I just wish the writers would stomp David/Charming into somebody that I could like


He's too dumb to win or live

In a game of thrones, he'd already be dead.

$REVIEW.: From my earliest involvement with horror films, or at least when I began learning about different directors and different approaches to the genre, I kept hearing great things about Nicholas Roeg's &quot;Don't Look Now,&quot; a 1974 adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's story of the same name. &quot;You just have to see this film,&quot; gushed many of my associates. When questioned further about plot, acting, and the like, all of them without exception just reiterated that it is a great, creepy yarn every horror fan should watch at least once. Since I couldn't find the film on VHS--this was before the proliferation of DVD--I briefly toyed with the idea of reading the book. Amazingly, I couldn't find a copy of du Maurier's story. I completely forgot about &quot;Don't Look Now&quot; until I stumbled over it recently during a DVD excursion. Hearing those accolades echoing in my head, I picked up a copy and headed home with high expectations. After watching the movie, I have to say that it was an extremely rewarding experience as well as a confusing one. Roeg's shocker doesn't lend itself easily to the sort of superficial viewing one indulges in when watching a typical horror film. Instead, this movie is a cerebral jaunt through the eerie worlds of psychic abilities, murder, and grief. Don't go into this one expecting a &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; sequel.John and Laura Baxter (played by Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, respectively) suffer an immense tragedy when their young daughter drowns in a pond at their house in England. The couple is obviously devastated by this incident, and in an effort to move beyond their grief John accepts a job in Italy refurbishing an ancient church. After leaving their other child in school in England, the Baxters move to the oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere of watery Venice. Things turn towards the bizarre very quickly upon their arrival: Laura suffers some sort of fainting fit in a restaurant resulting in a meeting with two extremely odd sisters who profess to have psychic powers. The two spinsters, one of whom is blind, take an immediate interest in John, perhaps recognizing in him some of the same supernatural abilities that they claim to possess. John scoffs at these claims even as he recognizes that his wife comes to revere the two because the women claim knowledge about their deceased daughter. As if this isn't odd enough, murder victims start turning up in the city canals, John nearly dies in an accident at the church, and a miniscule figure clad in the same attire their daughter wore when she died keeps popping up in the streets. When John starts seeing things that have no logical explanation, and as the two sister's pronouncements about an imminent danger become shriller, &quot;Don't Look Now&quot; assumes an even creepier mood.What does it all mean? I don't know, but Roeg's film sure has plenty of great camera work, good performances from its two leads, and a conclusion that is sure to shock the viewer in a way few movies can. Due to the glacial pace of most of the film and the confusing plot threads, I started to pay attention to some of the great scenes. The accident in the cathedral was wonderfully filmed, as were some of the unusual sightings John witnesses towards the end of the film. Of course, you don't know what they mean while you are watching them--you have to wait until the end to put those particular jigsaw pieces into their proper position--but they still convey an unshakable sense that something really wrong is going on. The nightmares unfold against the dreary backdrop of Venice, a town that tourists regularly crow about but a place that appears here as the height of sinister deeds. Buildings stand like mountains of despair, corpses fill the waterways, and the narrow alleyways often remind the Baxters of the daughter they lost whenever they see that little figure in the red coat running about. And that conclusion! Well, try and avoid reading about it in reviews until you see the movie lest you lose the chilling effect.Much has been made about the love scene between Sutherland and Christie. All I can say about this is that it is more and less than what people say about it. Roeg artfully and tastefully captures on film what was probably a quite explicit scene for the time. I cannot say I am all that impressed with seeing this much of Donald Sutherland. Watching him reach for a cabinet in &quot;Animal House&quot; wearing only a sweater did much to scar my young mind, so witnessing even more of Donald here induced nightmares for some time afterwards. As for Julie Christie, I can state with all my heart that she really needed to put on a few pounds. Some like to engage in a debate about &quot;did they or didn't they?&quot; with this scene, an argument that is completely useless and probably moot since Sutherland later claimed he was ill with a major cold when they shot the sequence. I did like how Roeg contrasted the couple's passion with rather mundane shots of the two getting ready to go out for dinner.Regrettably, the DVD only comes with a trailer. Fans of this greatly admired film would surely appreciate a commentary from Roeg, Sutherland, and Christie. You would think getting the three together to talk about the film wouldn't present any difficulties, but such is the way of DVD. Overall, &quot;Don't Look Now&quot; succeeds wildly in creating bleak atmosphere, a few intriguing scenes, and a grand conclusion. The molasses-like pacing and confusing plot will probably put many off, especially in this day of rapid fire editing and gory special effects. The movie remains an oddity appreciated by film buffs but neglected by the masses.

$REVIEW.: Inside the Third Reich purports to give the viewer a behind the scenes look at the inner dealings of Hitler's Nazi Party.  In many respects, it accomplishes this purpose admirably, but in many others, it must be  carefully weighed against other, more objective, sources.Rutger Hauer  does a commendable job of portraying Albert Speer, Hitler's chief architect  and one of the very few Nazi operatives to successfully stand up to the  Fuhrer.  He provides an excellent vehicle for depicting the petty but often  deadly jealosies that abounded within the Nazi inner circle, particularly  well done as relates to Martin Bormann and Josef Goebbels.Unfortunately,  the film attempts to all but whitewash Speer who, although not a major  player in many of the Reich's more notorious excesses, was nonetheless  directly involved, far more than revisionist historians wish to have  believed.Be that as is may, the movie itself is excellent.  The tone  is somber and studious, taking a near documentary approach in many of its  historical depictions.  Care is taken to allow many of the peripheral  characters to develop into fully involved human beings whom the viewer can  identify with, rather than mere statistics.  Strangely, however, this  careful approach does not extent to the major Nazi figures, particularly  Himmler and Bormann, who come off as near caricatures rather than  people.The story follows historical reality quite closely, achieving a  conclusion that is both unsettling and emotionally confused, a remarkably  accurate portrayal of the state of the German people at the conclusion of  hostilities.Derek Jacobi gives a powerful and surprisingly human  performance as Hitler, often refreshingly understated and only occasionally  reverting to the histrionics by which the dictator is frequently  stereotyped.This production is far from perfect, but it does give the  viewer a disturbing glimpse at the internal function of the Nazi decision  making process.  Whether viewed for its historical significance or simply  as a very good piece of drama, Inside the Third Reich will not disappoint.

$REVIEW.: I have never subscribed to the movie maxim that a great director makes for a great movie, but here it was never more true. Sydney Pollacks political thriller set inside the United Nations is a masterful pot boiler full of suspense, credible plot lines and directed with a masterful even handedness that is never overbearing. Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broom, a multi lingual translator working in the UN in New York, who overhears a plot to assassinate the dictatorial leader of Matobo (a war torn and divided African State). She is summarily placed under the protection of the Secret Service in the form of Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), an action that actually heightnes the nightmare into which she has become immersed, and the intrigue and suspense begins to build in even layers. Both Kidman and Penns characters are intertwined as they each deal with their own recent personal losses, but Pollack deliberatley steers away from a formula pattern of attraction, instead delving deep into character development and a great storyline. Is Kidman a target? a victim? or even a suspect? we find ourselves asking as the story unfolds. The two begin to play a gripping dance of evasion and revelation that keeps them both guessing as they head to stop a potential international crisis. There are some dramatic sequences, and thought provoking side comment along the way, giving the whole picture a complete and professional feel seldom seen in other films of the genre. The movie itself was groundbreaking as it is actually filmed  inside the UN (the first time this has ever been done), but this is just an interesting caveat to a great movie. Pollack himself pops up for a small but believable cameo (as he seems to do in most of his movies) but he takes a back seat to some top class acting, chiefly from Kidman and Penn in the lead roles. The early 2005 release will probably preclude an Oscar nod for next year, but this is right up there, and represents some of Pollacks best work, of the calibre of Three Days of the Condor, and The Firm to name just two. One or two very minor inconsistencies and flaws I felt personally, kept me from giving this 5 stars, but make no mistake, this is an excellent movie from all angles. Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: Olivia Manning was a British novelist of some renown, mainly due to her novels set during WWII in Bucharest, Athens and Cairo and based on the life she and her husband experienced as ex-pats and finally as exiles. During Manning's lifetime there were plans for some of her novels to be filmed but that did not transpire until 1987, several years after her death. At that time the BBC produced a brilliant mini-series called The Fortunes of War. Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh (who were later to marry and still later divorce) portrayed the characters of Harriet and Guy Pringle to such an effect that the viewer can feel these actors are indeed the Pringles (and by extension Manning and her husband). The DVD version that was issued in 2005 is a must-see for anyone who loves both literature and history and will enthrall those who celebrate the art of acting.Can &ouml;mlekiIstanbul Turkey

$REVIEW.: I think the reviews on this film are the least representative batch I've ever seen on Amazon

"Blue Demon" is a tongue in cheek film about a military research program that genetically alters sharks so they fight and defeat terrorists
If you can't see the humor in that premise, something's wrong.As you can imagine -- and, if you've been reading along, you see -- that things vary quite a bit from this premise right away
Something goes badly wrong with the sharks' computer program, they break out of their containment hatch, swim around in California waterways, eat some people, and more.The film has no real stars; DeDee Pfeiffer, a ringer for Cameron Diaz that has appeared in "CSI New York", is the main charcater with Randall Batinkoff, who plays her husband and fellow researcher; "Seinfeld" short person star Danny Woodburn, who plays their boss; and veteran character actor Jeff Fahey, who plays the military general behind the doublecross
None of these actors enhanced their careers with this movie but I'm sure they'd all agree it was fun to make.That's becuase it's fun to watch

I agree with the other critics that say it's inane; that's what makes it fun
And while the computer-generated sharks would never be confused with real animals...well, this is a movie, right? Did someone out there confuse this for a documentary? The sharks aren't any worse than other computer-generated fish I've seen in other recent films.My capsule summary is this: don't go into this thinking you're going to see one of the great action-horror films of recent years

But you can expect to be entertained by a fast moving flick that has a lot of humor and whose actors participate in the tongue in cheek format right from the first scene.

$REVIEW.: I re-visited this film the other night (on Thanksgiving) after not having seen it for some years. I remember when it first came out that I had mixed feelings about it and I still do. It's an interesting film (almost too interesting) but not really what I would call enjoyable. As portrayed in the film, Alice's Restaurant was not a particularly fun place to be.Part of the problem seems to the director's insistence on making the film "relevant" and "meaningful" in the heavy-handed manner that too many Sixties films did. The movie is most successful when following the mood and theme of the song on which it is supposed to be based; much less so when trying to pad out the plot. The Woody hospital scenes are a nice poignant touch, but the bike races are boring and the character of Shelly is just plain annoying. The acting throughout is inconsistent. Arlo Guthrie is likeable but lightweight and flashes his toothy grin once too often. Pat Quinn as Alice comes off best. Officer Obie is a nice touch but many of the rest of the cast seem to be Hollywood versions of very clean hippies wearing the latest fashions straight off the costume rack.The biggest problem in the film for me is the character of Ray who I find rather sinister. His background is never really explained and he comes across as a kind of cult leader, always going on about "our kids". His source of income is a mystery - he buys the church and sets up the restaurant but has to borrow $80 from Arlo. He's not very nice to Alice but she seems drawn to him. The hippies follow him without question, apparently happy to trade one establishment for another. The film seems unnecessarily dark whenever Ray is on the scene.I suppose it's interesting to see this film every once in a while, if only because it provides a kind of snapshot of the times. Perhaps not a totally accurate snapshot, but then memories have a way of improving on reality. For me, I think Alice's Restaurant would have been better with more comedy and less forced dramatics. But, after reading some of the other opinions on here, that is obviously a minority view and I expect the usual "unhelpful" votes for stating it. Peace, man!

$review_text.: Pete Walker's exploitation classics are a lot of fun to watch. I have only seen two at this point, his women in prison entry "The House of Whipcord" and "Frightmare." The former film is a seedy little picture that purportedly seeks to examine the dangers inherent in letting corporeal punishment and the legal system operate outside the bounds of society. That's the overt theme, but "House of Whipcord" is really an excuse to show a lot of young, scantily clad women with long hair enduring numerous brutalities behind the walls of a private prison. Walker pulled that film off with a bit of flair, I thought, so when I noticed he directed "Frightmare" I knew I needed to check it out. The two films couldn't be more different in execution and tone, but there is a passing resemblance between the two, i.e. both movies deal with the failures of the justice system. In "Whipcord," this meant extralegal activities of a decidedly unwholesome character. "Frightmare" examines what happens when approved legal mechanisms fail to rehabilitate the worst society has to offer. Yep, according to this film even those wretches addicted to dining on their fellow human beings can easily earn a second chance at free living.Edmund Yates (Rupert Davies) and his wife Dorothy (Sheila Keith) are just your average, everyday elderly couple looking to live out their remaining years in the comfort of a nice home. Unfortunately, we quickly learn that something isn't right with these two. They spent quite a few years in the confines of a mental asylum thanks to Dorothy's insatiable appetite for tarot cards and snacking on her fellow creatures. Edmund ended up incarcerated too, not because he took part in his wife's unsavory activities but because he knew what went on in the house and refused to stop it. Love makes us do silly things, doesn't it? Anyway, the authorities declare Dorothy cured and promptly release the couple back into society. As questionable as this release is, who can blame the good doctors and administrators at the asylum? Even if Dorothy somehow got a craving again, which she won't because of the curative abilities of modern psychology, both of these people are so old that they could hardly pose a threat to other citizens. It takes a lot of energy to hunt down humans, right? Wrong. According to Walker's film, all you need is good bait (an ad in the local papers offering a tarot card reading) and something heavy lying around the house with which to conk potential victims on the noggin.Alas, Edmund and Dorothy had two children before they entered the asylum. Daughter Jackie (Deborah Fairfax) now lives in the city with her younger sister Deborah (Kim Butcher). Jackie worked hard to shield her younger sibling from the horrors committed by their parents, and is convinced Deborah has no recollections of the unpleasantness or of the parents themselves. Unfortunately, the younger daughter is a major delinquent. She hangs out with a very rough crowd at the local pubs, and even goes so far as to goad her boyfriend into beating a bartender to a bloody pulp for refusing to serve her a drink. As we'll find out much later, Deborah is prepared to go much further than her ruffian friends where trouble is concerned. In the meantime, the two sisters battle incessantly about Deborah's problems, about her propensity for staying out at all hours of the night and her inability to listen to her older sister's advice. Jackie worries her sibling could end up in serious trouble with the authorities, a legitimate concern considering there has been a minor run in already. When Jackie meets a nice young man named Graham (Paul Greenwood), she tries to hide her embarrassing past from him. Suspicious that she might be seeing someone else, Graham follows her around and finds out far too late the bloody truth behind the Yates clan. As for Jackie, she discovers her efforts to keep sis out of the mix failed miserably.Gore and black humor is the name of the game in "Frightmare." "She's had a very serious relapse, I'm afraid," says Edmund Yates about his wife, in an understatement of hilarious yet frightening dimensions. As Dorothy slips back into her old lifestyle, the sauce starts to flow as thick as a river, especially when the old gal gets her hands on a power drill. The movie is so bloody, in fact, that it isn't surprising the British censors went after it with a pair of garden shears. Not that I agree with censoring something as minor as a horror movie, but the grue does occasionally achieve high levels. More important than the gory effects, however, is the performance of Sheila Keith as the depraved Dorothy. She oscillates between a lovey dovey attitude with her husband to pure nastiness with her victims, and it eventually becomes quite clear that this woman never had any intention of curtailing her grotesque habits. She is, rather, a schemer who treats strangers poorly because they represent nothing but food to her. When was the last time you treated a cow with respect? It's to Keith's credit that her nuanced performance keeps us in the dark as long as it does regarding the true, unredeemed nature of her character.Sadly, the DVD version of the film contains no extras. The picture quality isn't so hot, either. But none of that will matter after you finish watching this pitch-black horror picture. "Frightmare" contains everything a hardcore horror aficionado loves: gore, kooky characters in the throes of lunacy, great lines, good performances, nice looking young women, and a spooky conclusion that doesn't wrap things up in a tidy package. Between "The House of Whipcord" and "Frightmare," I would choose this film every time.

$REVIEW.: There have been four Crow movies, a TV series and numerous comic series and of all there have been, this rates at the bottom of the pile.  It almost felt like whoever put this thing together wanted to break away from the elements that made the Crow, in both movies and comics, work.The murder mystery wasn't very mysterious, it's always nice to see Kirsten Dunst doing work, but I wondered why she was even there.  The love story was based on her dead sister, so what? Another love interest?  It didn't play well.  The Crow, a normally trench coated avenger wore a trnchcoat in this for all of five minutes, and the educated evil police force was a serious stretch.All in all, I watched it because it was a Crow movie, a comic movie and hey, it had Kirsten Dunst, but it was far from something I'd spend serious time watching again though I do own it.  Whenever I need some background noise and want something to grab my attention only at certain times, this works if there's nothing else available.

$REVIEW.: By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MississippiLaw & Order: Criminal Intent is the third series connected to the Law & Order franchise. All were created by Dick Wolf. He got his start with Miami Vice (1984-1989). Dick did have help with Criminal Intent, Ren&eacute; Balcer, who also wrote for the series Star Trek: The Next Generation.Criminal Intent follows the Major Case Squad, a division of the New York City Police Department.In season 8, Detective Mike Logan (Chris Noth) is replaced by Detective Zack Nichols (Jeff Goldblum). I think even Jeff knows he's an aquired taste. In this case it works. We find out early that Mike is the child of two psychiatrists. His reason for becoming a cop seems to be a form of rebellion. The Jewish actor, however, has decided not to return to Criminal Intent due to persistent concerns about the program's future.Also included are Detective Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio), Detective Alexandra Earnes (Kathryn Erbe), Detective Megan Wheeler (Julianne Nicholson) and Captain Danny Ross (Eric Bogosian).Some of the key episodes are "Rock Star" in which Wheeler and Nichols investigate the stabbing of an artist, which is followed by a seemingly unrelated elevator death of a musician."Identity Crisis" where two young brothers are turned over to foster services after their schizophrenic mother is electorcuted in the bathtub. They are separated. One becomes successful. The other does not, but they are brought back together long enough for one to kill the other.

They figure the case is closed, but Jerry isn't satisfied, because he watched the way the poor wretch, who had some pretty severe and obvious mental problems, had been manipulated into confessing.Jerry does some digging and discovers that there have been three other murders in the area in the last several years, so similar that the victims were all blonde little girls in red dresses.

$review_text.: This film is to "Fahrenheit 9/11" what a symphony is to a ragtime pianist: infinitely more complex, multilayered, subtle and incisive...but also far less accessible to the average viewer with the typical 15-second attention span.I've never read any of Chomsky's books, only excerpts and reviews and lots of casual mention of him but in this film he comes across as surprisingly good-humored, down to earth and likeable.  Nothing like the raging paranoid ivory tower freak that the wingnuts like to caricature him as.Tons of "aha!" moments while watching...but try not to watch this film after a heavy meal.4.5 stars
$SUMMARY.: Awesome...if you're up to it.

$review_text.: While Gravity does have one minor problem in that it's really hard to base an entire movie around the concept of drifting in space, the film does do everything in its power to at least deliver as much as it possibly can with such a limited idea.  While I don't really care for either George Clooney or Sandra Bullock, the good news is that Clooney's smugness is somewhat reserved and Sandra's usual talkative whining is at least justified in this case since her life is constantly in the balance.  After all she's lost in space by herself.  She has to depend on herself and her limited set of skills to figure out how to launch her space shuttle homeward.  Not an easy task.Surprisingly Gravity does have its share of emotional moments, usually in the way Sandra reflects on her past and specifically a family tragedy that she constantly struggled with (and still struggles with).  The special effects are honestly amazing.  Whether or not teardrops and fire drops actually move as realistically in outer space as portrayed in this film is anyone's guess.  I'm leaning towards they are fairly realistic.  The film may be short at just over 80 minutes, but it's compelling enough that it's not a major issue.I'm normally not even a Sandra Bullock fan.  The last movie she starred in that I enjoyed was the Blind Side and of course, Speed will always be a classic in my book.  But she nails another nail-biting unforgettable performance here.  When things go array and she's desperately trying to cling onto any floating objects she can fearing she might drift away into endless space, you really hope she can grab onto *something* just for the slim chance she'll be able to continue surviving, which is exactly what a good suspense is supposed to do.Gravity proves one thing that used to be a personal problem I had in my late teens- knowing that outside of earth there's millions of miles of nothingness.  This can be the most frightening thing ever.  A lot of people think it's beautiful- floating around forever and experiencing nothing but silence, but I personally think it's terrifying enough to totally make me wish I was dead if I ever found myself in such a situation.  I'm not even exaggerating either.  This is why I was strongly against viewing Jodie Foster's Contact back when that movie was new.  In Gravity the camera angles do all kinds of twists and turns as Sandra and Clooney spin around which is enough to not only make me fear outer space even more than I already do, but can make a viewer dizzy.  It's absolutely brilliant the way the sunlight shines during certain dizzy segments, and its location based on planet Earth at the time these events occur.  It seems so realistic... but is it?  And by the way, Sandra and Clooney remain fairly close to Earth the entire time.On a side note, it's very strange how Clooney and Sandra are spinning and floating around in outer space and having normal conversations.  I'm pretty sure I'd be quite terrified!  Even when the two separate and desperation kicks in, there's still a temporary feeling of normalcy which is really bizarre.Overall I really enjoyed Gravity quite a bit.  Expect a slow, tacky and unappealing introduction since the movie basically just THROWS viewers into the outer space elements right away with very little in the way of a logical or appealing build-up, but I have to conclude that Gravity does its job in making me feel satisfied with the film.  The cinematography at the very least should be amazing enough to entice people to watch this.  Not for the faint of heart however- if you've ever had or currently have fears of what it's like to be somewhere other than earth much like the terrible thoughts that dominated my teenage years, this movie may sort of mess with your mind and make your imagination go wild in a frightening way, so be on the lookout for that.

$review_text.: Ivan Markov, a young son of poor peasants, is granted an officer's commission in Czarist Russia. He falls in love with Princess Tamara. Caught in her room, Markov is thrown into prison. But, then comes the Red Terror...In 1927, United Artists signed John Barrymore to a 3-picture contract at $100,000. each. The second of these projects was 1928's "Tempest".  Barrymore had starred in "Hamlet" in London just 3 years before. A battery of directors(Victor Toujansky, Lewis Milestone, and Sam Taylor) all worked on "Tempest". A fourth director(Erich von Stroheim) wrote the script. "Tempest" cinematographer Charles Rosher won the first-ever Academy Award for Photography for "Sunrise". Art Director William Cameron Menzies won the first Academy Award for Interior Direction for his efforts on "Tempest(He received another Oscar in 1939 for a little movie called "Gone With the Wind")". So much talent. So much promise....Recalling Jack Barrymore years later, co-star Camilla Horn reported that "When we were dancing together in a beautiful ballroom scene..He fell down with me on the floor because he was so drunk." Barrymore's acting here is fine. But his love scenes with Horn feel cold and contrived; a clear departure from his roles opposite Costello and Garbo. Grandly mounted and lavishly filmed, "Tempest" unravels as an expensive souffle; fattening and dull.  Image Entertainment's brand new "Tempest" DVD is a 1.33:1 full-screen release. A marvelous extra is the rare home-movie "Vagabonding on the Pacific". Filmed in 1926, it chronicles Barrymore aboard his 93-foot schooner, The Mariner, his holiday on Guadalupe Island, and rare elephant seals. The details can be found in Gene Fowler's "Good Night Sweet Prince". I enjoyed watching the fascinating Barrymore in "Tempest" for the very first time. But,non-fans may not be so intrigued. 1928's "Tempest" fared well in New York, and faded in the suburbs.  Barrymore's contract was not renewed. Happily, a brand-new cinema novelty was just around the corner. It would usher in some of John Barrymore's finest roles and greatest films...It was called sound.

$review_text.: Hollow ManScore: 45/100This is basically a double episode of the TV show The Invisible Man. There is not much else to be said, except how lacking this film is in both a horrific and dramatic atmosphere. No, wait! I forgot all the other bad things about Hollow Man! Oh, well, I might as well put them into a review. Here goes!A group of scientists, led by the brilliant yet eccentric twinkle-addicted Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), are successfully researching invisibility. Having accomplished making animals invisible, Caine insists on being the next subject for the experiment. Unfortunately, the serum effects not only the external physical nature of the subject, but morphs the internal personality too. And that's when things start to go horribly wrong...And that is also where the script and lots of other things start to go wrong in the film. Hollow Man starts promisingly, with a shocking opening scene and a thrilling gorilla chase, but it quickly puts itself down and starts to be overly-silly, using a whole bunch of original ideas to try and keep the audiences entertained, while all we're doing in our seats is yawning and trying to keep our eyes open as much as possible. The performances are awful, Elisabeth Shue is just so terrifyingly horrid in her role that she deserves a big, fat Razzie, and a gigantic knife in the back. Kevin Bacon overacts stupidly, and turns what could've been a chilling performance into one big joke. The characters Shue, Bacon and all their co-star's play are far from likeable, and Paul Verhoeven's direction effort isn't plausible, it seemed like all he was waiting for was the fake-looking and typical CGI ending we see in crappy blockbusters just like this ones.Not exactly the worst film of 2000, but this is far from been anything but a wannabe and completely pointless invisible man `thriller.'

$review_text.: This is a very intriguing movie, despite the fact that it is a silent film

It's very similar to the original novel by Gaston Leroux, except for in one significant detail..

In the original story, Erik (the Phantom) is psychologically unstable, unloved, and horrific in appearance and often behavior
However, he also mirrors what is intrinsically human: the desire to be loved and accepted as we are


The interpretation of the classic story denied the Phantom this sense of humanity, which left me feeling very dissatisfied with the ending

On a brighter note, Lon Chaney's makeup is fantastic and believable!

$review_text.: This will be my first review of a Spike Lee film, which happens to be Lee's first film. As I have begun for the Coen Brother's films, It is my goal (as I have the first five films sitting in a stack atop my DVD player) to review all of Lee's films chronologically as I watch them. Therefore, check periodically on my review page.  In regards to this review, believe it or not, this is only the second Spike Lee film I have ever watched, therefore I have little to say about how this film compares to his others.I'll start with the only problem I have with this film:In regards to the Coen Brother's directorial debut, "Blood Simple" (which I have reviewed as well), "She's Gotta Have" It is way more film schoolish.  I just have a slight bias against any film which gives the slightest impression that the film was for a Master's thesis or something of that nature. But Lee's choice of B&W; surely has a lot to do with this as does the nature of the script.And on to what I liked about the film:As for that script mentioned above, during the entire course of the film, the characters from the film are constantly communicating directly to you (the viewer), telling you their thoughts, concerns and annoyances.As film schoolish as this may be, it adds a wonderful dynamic to the film which calls for a more intimate viewer, where you have no choice but to get involved.This film is noted as a turning point in African-American film, away from the Blaxploitation era. Differing from this era, it is actually more real, more believable and Spike Lee is a brave soul for sharing these wonderful people with us. "She's Gotta Have It" brings us into the lives of what seem to be educated African-American living in and out of a very beautiful Brooklyn. I give one thumb up to Lee just for showing us the real Brooklyn and areas.All the things we are accustomed to seeing in African-American films or films that depict African Americans are simply not there. Their apartments are not run-down, they are not struggling with jobs, drugs or violence. All that we are really faced with is a group of four people who are fairly different from each other and are at different moments in their lives. The man who is ready for a real caring/trustworthy relationship, the man who is in need of a wife for reasons of social status, a "I need a sometimes girlfriend" man (Lee's hysterical character) and a woman who is playing the field.All in all, this movie is a wonderful character study of Nola Darling (played by Tracy Camilla Johns) who takes on what is most often reserved for men in movies (i.e. sleeping with many partners with little concern for morality.) Here is Lee's twist, and here is what makes this movie great. We see the many shades of a person expressed through her need for three men for three separate reasons: when she needs a laugh, when she needs a shoulder, when she needs a body. For his first film, Spike Lee does a terrific job in showing us how we all are a slightly different person to each person we know.

$REVIEW.: I rented this film after being impressed by James Garner's portrayal of Woodrow F Call in Streets of Laredo
 Most of the cast seem to be having a great time but too many jokes fall flat
 Neither Gibson and Foster seem to have a clue playing Western characters

 Like Billy Crystal in City Slickers with none of the irony
 The film is lighthearted with chuck wagon loads of old TV western cliches
 Guns being shot off peoples hands, Mel rescuing a run-away stagecoach, and a Royal Flush winning hand
 Yawn

(Which shows how brilliant Spielberg was in Raiders of the Lost Ark, bringing a fresh variation to a tired action sequence.)  Its all done by the numbers with no inspiration


 If you're looking for a film about clever slight of hand and humourous double crosses you're better off watching The Sting with Newman and Redford.The movie was a great re-union of old TV western stars, country singers, and modern actors
 I wish they remembered to make a movie worth renting.

$REVIEW.: Thank you, Criterion!  Now on DVD, THE raw story of survival in mid- nineteenth century Africa.  Cornel Wilde demonstrates his considerable acting talent and physical prowess against the backdrop of terrific settings and tribal communities - pitting himself against natural selection of a different kind.When Wilde's character sets out with other 'great white hunters' as part of an ivory-gathering safari, he soon realizes that his not-so-savvy compatriots have made a mistake when they refuse to pay tribute to a tribe whose property they have crossed.  In slighting them, they have set themselves up for a particularly brutal penalty.  While most of the safari members are killed outright, the leaders are singled out for summary judgement.  One is actually cooked on a spit and one is placed in a pit with a cobra. Only Wilde's character manages to face a true test of endurance.Reminiscent of the Old West "run of the arrow", Wilde is given a head start until he reaches a set distance - after which his able pursuers put him through the paces.  With the hunters determined to run him down and kill him, the pursuit takes us through many twists and turns as our hero manages to elude the relentless trackers.  In the interim, we receive the benefit of beautiful African scenery, magnificent animals, exotic tribal music, and a chase that is genuinely captivating.Criterion has actually isolated the soundtrack - something that I kept on an old vinyl recording from many years ago.  This is a splendid film, particularly for anyone who really has a genuine zeal for Africa!

$REVIEW.: an insightful and hysterical dark comedy that demonstrates what happens to our psyches when we live in an environment of lies, greed and superficiality


 the setting in this case is wall street, but wall street is really a metaphor for modern society at large

 the main character at first, acting on impulse, starts knocking off the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; of the over bearing, manipulative, pretentious creeps he encounters


 as his madness grows he loses sight of good and bad people and starts killing indiscriminately

 the main actor christian bale does a great job portraying the serial killer patrick bateman, in a stylish performane on par with richard gere's breakout role in &quot;american gigolo.&quot;  all this and a surprise ending that will keep you guessing and questioning after the movie has ended.

$review_text.: You know, if there ever was a director that I fully understood why people weren't into his works, that director would be David Lynch. Lynch's movies, with the exception of his excellent Disney escapade "The Straight Story", are frustrating unless you know what your getting into, are dense and heavy with imagery, and he spends little to no time expaining to you what these images mean, and he I don't really think he cares whether or not you get them or not. So I don't think your wrong if you don't dig the man. Just not into his flicks. Me? I think the dude's a genius."Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me", David Lynch's big screen prequel to his phenomnally successful, is Lynch at his most Lynchiest: the movie makes little sense if you're not willing to pay attention, is full of strange and at times complex imagery, is dark and at times disturbing and at other times funny. The movie was generally lambasted upon its release, hated by fans of the show. The movie is like the show with the volume turned all the way up and shot in a dark, rainy alleyway.But that's what makes "FWWM" such a good movie. The movie infurated its audience when it first came out(though in retrospect I bet many people who hated it have grown to see its point), and can be openly interpreted by anyone. Its not as cold as "Lost Highway", or as intriguing as "Mullholland Drive", but is still a movie that requires you to watch it one hundred percent from beginning to end.The acting in the film is all top notch, as is the camera work, but the real star of this movie, as in many of Lynch's crazy opuses, is musician Angelo Badalmentti, whose score evokes images in your mid that aren't even in the movie. The music he composes goes from dark and ambient to typical jazz suites to upbeat numbers without blinking, and all give the scenes that they are in a different mood and feel. To see how music can affect a scene or even an entire movie, "FWWM" is essential viewing.This movie isn't for everyone. The people who dislike aren't necessarily wrong, this just isn't their cup of coffee. But "FWWM" is a fascniating look at the underbelly of suburbia, and is one of Lynch's best flicks yet.Happy viewing.

$REVIEW.: We loved Rare Exports and we will definitely be watching this movie every Christmas.We are addicted to Scandinavian movies and books

Our family loved the original "Let the Right One In", "Dead Snow", "Cold Prey", "Troll Hunter"
I'm sure there are others

But also non-horror Scandinavian movies like "Kitchen Stories" and "Everlasting Moments"


We just ordered "101 Reykjavik".So we were surprised to learn about Rare Exports

We had never heard of it and NPR movie reviewer Bob Mondello was reviewing it one week or so before the holidays


I ordered the blu-ray right away and got it in time for Christmas Eve
What a perfect way to spend the night

Completely quirky and irreverent


An all out assault on Santa Claus


I'm PA Dutch and we have the Belsnickel and I don't want that guy sneaking in my chimney either.If you read the other reviews you can see the particulars about the movie starting off as a short


The shorts are included on the blu-ray version.

$review_text.: This story is a train wreck, and I'm not sure I mean that in a good way.  From the very beginning, you just know bad stuff is going to happen, and maybe it can't be put right again.  And the longer the movie goes, the more sure you are that this is an "E" Ticket to no place good, especially after dodging so many red herrings.  Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrance Howard and company perform beautifully (certainly no actress plays the distraught, disarrayed woman better than Maria Bello).  The pacing is slow and I just knew that even if the lost girls were found unharmed, the families would never ever be the same again.  It's a hard movie to watch when you consider the far-reaching consequences of the actions taken, but still I liked it overall.  But, then again, I'd watch Hugh Jackman cross the street.......
$SUMMARY.: Whoo!  What a ride!

$REVIEW.: The late 1970s and early 1980s were a groundbreaking period for science fiction films. It got kicked off by "Star Wars," which fueled the imaginations of many directors of the time. It also caused studios to trip over each other in their search for the next big space saga. Some of those films were fun like "Battle Beyond the Stars." Others were serious works of art like "Alien," "The Black Hole," and Peter Hyams' "Outland."Thanks to Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, "Outland" is available on Blu-ray for the first time. This was director Hyams' first journey into deep space. He worked in the sci-fi field once before with "Capricorn One," but this 1981 cult classic took him to another world... or moon would be more accurate. Some say this was Hyams' practice for the more complex "2010," which he helmed a couple of years later.Veteran Federal Marshal William O'Niel (Sean Connery) is assigned to a mining operation on Jupiter's moon, Io. He soon discovers the foreman (Peter Boyle) of the mine, Mark Sheppard, is supplying his workers with a deadly amphetamine that increases their work stamina but causes psychotic breakdowns and hallucinations. O'Niel finds himself going up against Sheppard's hired assassins with only the help of the mining operation's medical doctor, Lazarus (Frances Sternhagen)."Outland" has all the elements of a classic sci-fi film of the 1970s / 1980s era. You have the claustrophobic environment of the space station. All the corridors and living areas are metallic or medical stark white. Everyone wears military / law enforcement ball caps and jumpsuits of some type. Most of the men in the film have big bushy beards and long hair. They also smoke in environments where they shouldn't be.Jerry Goldsmith composed the soundtrack for the film. It resembles the score of "Alien" to an extent. There's a dash of "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" in it as well. I can't say the music is as memorable as either one of those, but it gets the job done.The movie is very much a sci-fi version of the classic western stand-off and 1970s drug smuggling drama. Imagine "High Noon" mashed together with "Serpico" but on a moon of Jupiter. One of its most effective elements is the digital clock countdown which shows when the ship is arriving that holds the assassins sent to kill O'Niel. It's nerve-wracking to watch Connery's character preparing for his lone stand against corruption.The practical and front projection special effects accurately reflect the time period the movie was made in. We get prosthetic heads blowing up, bodies bursting in space, and other visual atrocities. It's nice to see some effects reminiscent of "Alien," "Scanners," and "The Thing" versus all the CGI we're fed today.The high definition transfer looks great. The picture is as clean as it's ever been. It exposes some of the limits on the special effects of the time but there's always going to be a give and take in these situations. The 5.1 surround sound delivers an excellent audio experience. Every blast of a gun, hiss of an airlock, and note of the musical score jumps out at you.One thing consumers won't be happy with is the amount of special features included. There's commentary by Peter Hyams and a theatrical trailer. That's all we get. Where's the "Making of" featurette or documentary? Surely there's behind-the-scenes footage lying around somewhere.If you're looking for the best audio and visual presentation of this classic film, the Blu-ray version of "Outland" is pleasing. Just don't expect this new version to include a great amount of bonus materials. It's still recommended for people who continually seek to upgrade their home entertainment collections.

$REVIEW.: This is a great season of a great series... or a great series of a great show (depending on what side of the pond you happen to be on... )  Christopher made an excellent return for the Doctor and his performance is often underrated in my opinion.  I could go on and on, but the basic idea is if you are looking at this, then you probably already have some sense of what Doctor Who is and, while he is no David Tennant or Tom Baker, in the history of Doctor Who, there had been no one who better portrayed the torment of the Timelord adrift alone, returning to humanity and having his own &#34;humanity&#34; returned to him.

I am a fan of slap stick comedy like A Fish Called Wanda and Highheels and Low Lifes but how can they beat a movie that has all these zany characters on a farsical race to get stolen loot that none of them have any right to. Sid Caesar and Edie Adams may top the list when they get locked in a hardware strore. Then try on Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett who try a short cut by flying ends up with a drunk pilot (Jim Backus) that can't fly and Paul Ford along with Jesse White trying to give them instructions to land is hilarious. And don't forget the fisticuffs between Terry-Thomas and Milton Berle. This will have you laughing all the way through.

$review_text.: Georgina Terry plays Pollyanna with a sweet faced, ever-happy style that suits the plot. It's pretty faithful to the original plot of the missionary's daughter, orphaned and coming to live with a strict aunt. As Pollyanna plays her "Glad Game" and teaches it to the problem characters, the villagers' lives are transformed. Everyone from the reclusive misanthrope to the chronically ill to the town doctor find new ways of looking at life from interacting with the little girl.The very name Pollyanna is now synonymous for unreasoning optimism due to this book. I loved this story when I read it as a child and am glad they treated it well in this remake.The costumes and setting fit very well (although the original book was not English) and have the usual high quality of a Masterpiece Theater production.I had to knock off a star because sometimes the actors spoke too fast or breathlessly so some of the dialogue is lost.

$review_text.: The female cast here is very strong with a powerful performance by Malin Brystrom as Donna Anna and a delightful performance of Zerlina by Sunhae Im.To me the male singers were let down by Allessandro Guerzoni in the role of Commendatore whose voice lacked the the commanding authority needed in the role. After a hair raising scream by Malin Brystrom in the last act, the entrance of Alessandro down the aisle of the audience towards Don Giovanni was an anti climax and waving the red curtain to simulate Giovanni's descent into hell was unconvincing. The use of red strobe lighting was an obvious omission and made this last scene less dramatic than it should have been.Apart from that this production is most enjoyable with great acting and singing accompanied by glorious orchestral accompliment. So, recommended but with the above caveat.
$review_summary.: Very competent and enjoyable production, spoiled a little by the Commendatore

$review_text.: We get it, Carl, you hate God, and everyone who likes him is dumb.Moving on. I can't analyze all the big theories and allegories this movie undoubtedly has. I'll leave that to people who claim to be experts in the fields of space stuff and God stuff. Or movie stuff. I can however say for the moderately inquisitive and curious readers and watchers of sci-fi, who hope that the center of the universe isn't our little marble, and maybe, just maybe, there's room for more people and maybe even a deity out there, that this was a pleasant movie if you can get past all that bile-raising stuff. Sagan wasn't so much as educating the uneducated as bashing and berating those who do not agree with him. I think he had the opposite effect, unless that was his sole intention, to seem small minded and angry. If I make a movie about space, hope, and the future I'll probably try to not degrade over half the people of my planet and fill it full of politics and hate.It kind of makes me think if there were someone else out there they'd watch how we belittle each other (as per this movie) and pass right on by.But it gets an "A" for effort. I'll take away this part of the movie (unless I made it up myself). The future could use more open minded and enthusiastic hopeful people.

$REVIEW.: It's a common belief that John Woo lost his way when he moved to Hollywood, but in truth his career was always highly erratic even in his Hong Kong days. For every Better Tomorrow or The Killer on his resume there's at least one disappointment on the level of Bullet in the head.On paper Bullet in the Head looks like John Woo's most ambitious and under-rated film, but sadly it turns out to be an entirely derivative and largely ineffective shoot-em-up that blows its few good ideas in all the overkill. There's the germ of a good idea in its sprawling tale of three friends who skip the rioting Hong Kong of 1967 to make their fortune in the chaos of Vietnam, but it's quickly lost amid the cartoon carnage - this is the kind of film where Woo will add a bomb disposal man having his arms blown off to the background of a romantic parting, and that's one of the more subtle scenes. Clunking construction and wild leaps of logic abound (it's hard to take Jacky Cheung's cries of "Don't make me commit murder!" seriously after we've just seen him gun down thirty people) and the tragedy of Vietnam is reduced to the level of a video game in several over the top and largely uninvolving action scenes.There are a few mildly effective moments, such as Simon Yam's memorable introduction, but the lasting impression is of a hack who has seen The Deer Hunter and The Killing Fields several times without ever really understanding them. Horrendously disappointing. No misjudged underappreciated lost masterpiece, just a mess - and even more so  in  this  cut  DVD.

$REVIEW.: FARSCAPE: THE COMPLETE SERIES (15TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION) is produced by Jim Henson Productions, Hallmark Entertainment, Jim Henson Television, Nine Film & Television Pty. Ltd., Nine Network Australia, and the Sci-Fi Channel. DVD distribution for this release is being handled by Cinedigm and New Video.My wife discovered this series in bits and pieces over the last six years or so on random discovery trips into our satellite stations. We did not have any cable or satellite available to us where we live when the series first debuted so it was all-new to us.My wife enjoyed the episodes we watched so when I saw it on sale I bought the entire series and the Peacekeeper Wars for her as a birthday gift.The first two years of the series were interesting, full of humor and bonded us to the cast and concepts.In the third season they went &#8220;off the reservation&#8221; with a lot of repeated scenes from previous episodes and a god-awful cartoon parody that was, for us, one of the most annoying episodes of any show anywhere ever. Two Crichton's was another distraction.It was an amazing feat that even with all the distractions we viewers were able to see the cast rally and destroy not only a giant Peacekeeper station but also overcome masterminds and insurmountable threats.The loss of the redeemed Crais and Talyn was regrettable.Then the diabolical Furlow not only gets the drop on Chrichton and Aeryn betraying them to the enemy but she is able to destroy the benevolent and super evolved &#8220;Old One&#8221; most primitively and destroy half of John Crichton. If there was a message in this we didn&#8217;t get it. We were thinking &#8220;say it isn&#8217;t so&#8221;.The loss of Zhaan (played by Virginia Hey) was a huge blow for us and Stark (played by Paul Goddard) morphing into a pathetic fool from a gifted spiritualist and then somewhere in between seemed out of character.For us Scorpious probably should have been killed off or at least banished to somewhere to emerge from time to time in his real form by the end of the third season. He was a character we had loved to hate and then he became an almost father figure to the fugitives on board Moya. We had some empathy for him when his early years were revealed but he committed so many dastardly acts We did not see anything hastening his path to redemption.The introduction of Commandant Grayza and Sikozu kept the plot moving along but WE felt the ever-changing loyalties and ridicules and childish acts of endangering the group by Chiana and Rygel flew over the cookoo nest once too often. Sikozu could have had a Mr. Spock quality with her scientific knowledge and penchant to plan well. She would have been greater in our opinion as a rival leader to the charismatic Chricton and the authorative D&#8217;Argo instead of a constantly inconsistent Scorpious acolyte.Season 4 started with the John Quixote, Kansas and Bad Timing episodes and these were distracting and trite as far as we were concerned. Events with far reaching disturbance to the space-time continuum offered nothing new and the Chiana foolery was annoying.It is our belief that this could have been one of the all time great Science Fictions series. Season three jumped the shark with the cartoon episode and then the subsequent poor start to Season Four sunk the series. We started to go from dying to see the next episode to falling asleep in the middle of them.The sound quality of the DVD was poor. There are no sub-titles available in the set up but we were able to synchronize the DVD with the internal close captioning in our Sony and that helped immensely.All in all the series was probably a lot better than average but what started out with so much promise just fizzled for us.  It is no small wonder there was no season five for the writers to pull things back together and bring the faithful back to the fold.The cast was wonderful and we recognized a few of the guest characters from other shows like Legend of the Seeker. They did a great job. We suppose that with all the makeup and costume changes it must have been insanely difficult for them. They should get ten stars as a group!The special effects, mix of puppets and the living, the various sets and the ship Moya itself was amazing and worth the full purchase price. We would encourage everyone to purchase Farscape there is nothing on today that we can acess comparable or better overall. So many of the episodes were five star quality.

$review_text.: "Top Secret!" is a classic example of that wildly popular film genre, the "combination World War II spy movie and Elvis movie romance/ comedy/parody".  I'm being silly, but my dumb joke essentially sums up what's good and bad about this goofy romp: if you're familiar with the genres being raked over the coals in the movie, you'll have a good time.  If you're not so familiar with those types of films (in other words, if you're under 30 and only watch new stuff on TV), this movie will mostly leave you at sea.Myself, I'm not so old but DO like to watch a lot of old stuff on TV and DVD, so I had fun with the jokes and the sensibilities being mocked.  Having said that, though, I still would rank "Top Secret!" only somewhere in the middle of the Abrahams/Zucker film canon.  There just weren't enough laugh-out-loud moments, and a couple of the gross jokes were a little too, well... gross (not that I was offended, just kinda nauseated).  On that last point, let me share a bit of advice: you might want to scoot the kids and pre-teens out of the room before you watch this movie, unless you feel like answering questions about the outrageously-in-bad-taste "marital aid" featured in the prison cell scene with Val Kilmer.  Or the "violation" scene when the two guys are wearing the cow suit.  I admit I'm chuckling a bit now as I think of those scenes (see, I'm not a prude), but I'm certainly glad it was just me and my wife in the room when we recently watched the film on DVD.Oh, and if you think MY comments about the movie are only lukewarm positive, wait'll you hear the commentary track.  The Abrahams/Zucker folks, though dropping a few affectionate comments here and there and admiring a sight gag or two, essentially hate the movie and wonder what they were thinking when they made it.  Myself, I think they were being a little harsh.  If you don't expect the world, "Top Secret!" is a tolerable and moderately entertaining bit of silliness.

$review_text.: I bought this DVD in April 2004 and did not have the time to write a review.Contrary to others, I do not see a Love story here but a metaphor on how twisted Life can be, with great or tiny tragedies and how people deal with them.I have read some reviews and I agree that this is a kind of a movie that you either grasp it or miss it altogether. The slow pace is painstakingly slow indeed, but that is another facet of the movie that ads to the kind of impact it causes: you don't feel it, you just want to know how the story ends, you just want to see how the movie wraps up. And when it ends, you feel your heart all taken by the story: "Hiromitsu loves Sandy"I have seen this movie over and over - even bought the CD with its soundtrack, for I loved it - and every time I marvel with Toni Collette's and Yumiko Tanaka's performance in the scene at the airport, when they come to terms with dignity.One must understand the Japanese mentality to truly grasp the meaning of what Sandy did and why, for she was able to figure out the Japanese way and how important it was to Hiromitsu's wife, who would have to deal with a lot of unanswered questions in her heart for the rest of her life. And likewise, then, one will understand Yumiko's "thank you"

$review_text.: I was only 12 when I saw this the first time, and my father actually had to push me into watching it. Well, now I know more about the cross parents are forced to carry for the sake of their children. The movie is a crucial study, although I suggest that parents wait until their children are of a certain age first. (After all, some of the history is quite brutal. Ex The scourging of Christ.) But the movie is VERY well done. The scenery is dramatic but realistic. (A rare combination these days!) The acting is captivating but not hammed up. The 4 different gospels are harmoniously intertwined. Also, although the movie is over 6 hours long, it is never boring. Perhaps the greatest thing about this is the director's combination of speculation AND fact. On one hand, he shows us the events of the gospels. But, he ALSO offers an interesting interpretation of events not in the scriptures. (Ex. Peter flies into a rage when Matthew 'the tax collector' joins Christ and Andrew has to hold Peter back.) Now this is not in the scriptures, but the apostles were after all human, and this event is not outside possibility. The director reminds us that the apostles had weaknesses. Also, the director allows us some possible insight into Judas. (Judas being tricked by the authorities into betraying Christ is not implausible.) My only complaint is that the ressurection could have been given some more time. (But maybe after 6 hours everyone was getting tired.) I feel this is a crucial study for all members of the church.

$REVIEW.: I was a huge fan of this show. I thought it was a different kind of show with a lot of promise. I never missed an episode nor did I ever think it was like Highlander (One of my all time favorites). The two shows are so different; how people keep comparing the two is beyond me.In this show you have the honorable hero(Raphael Cain), his wisecracking sidekick who always gets in trouble(Goodwin), and a parapsychologist who invented a demon-summoning machine(Dr. Sara Beckman). Each episode is filled with action, awesome effects, great writing, and excellent acting. You also get to watch the big storyline (Rafe trying to find his daughter, Kiyomi) unravel with each episode.

$REVIEW.: [For fans]  This is a righteous blast from the past..
a no-holds-barred, edgy head-trip of pure heavy metal goodness that got up in peoples' faces and said **** you man!!![For non-fans] Think of classic Hanna-Barbera or maybe even a medieval wood engraving for both the character rendering and animation featured in this extremely dated film where most of the artistic effort was apparently infused into the barbarian chick (more like "Fire & Ice") and some of the scenic artwork from the last 10 minutes thus leaving the remainder embarrassingly deficient


 As far as plot synopsis, it's basically a group of pointless short stories (emulating anthology, comic mags that were big in the 70's & 80's) strung together by a talking green globe, all really meant to be a vehicle for the much talked about soundtrack

 And finally, for the much talked about soundtrack..


it's pretty much the same stuff you'll hear endlessly on just about any classic rock station.[For fans] Dude..
you should totally get this...
no price is too high..

Then it was strange because I felt like I was watching two movies at once, one pretty good, &#34;heist gone wrong&#34; flick with Jason Statham and then one really really bad stupid comedy/drama movie with Jennifer Lopez who walked all over my guy movie. Don't get me wrong, I like Jennifer Lopez as much as the next guy but not in this movie please. It's almost like somebody &#34;wrote her in&#34; to the script for some bizarre reason. I love women in guy movies but only to a certain extent. They need to talk very little or be as cool/tough as the lead male character such as Michelle Rodriguez.

$review_text.: Is there anyone left on the planet who does not know MARY POPPINS?  Made in 1963-1964, after a thirty year battle to convince a very stubborn and possessive P. L.  Travers  to give Walt Disney the rights to her book(s), it may be the Disney Studios' crowning film achievement.  It is a wonderful movie, a flawless blend of live action and animation, with some of the most beautiful and detailed matte paintings in movie history.  Julie Andrews, who won a Best Actress Oscar in her film debut, is the perfect nanny in 1910 Edwardian England to Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber).  And the movie won four other technical and music Oscars, with a still untopped thirteen total nominations.With chimney sweep/street artist/best buddy Bert (Dick Van Dyke in peak form), Mary Poppins leads Jane and Michael on many magical adventures.  These include a live-action/animation day in the park ("Supercalifragilisticexpealidocis"), a tea party on a ceiling with Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, the hauntingly beautiful "Feed the Birds" with bird woman Jane Darwell, and the Oscar-winning "Chim-Chim-Curree" on the rooftops of London.  (Peter Ellenshaw allegedly did 100 breathtakingly beautiful and detailed matte paintings for this movie, winning a well-deserved visual effects Oscar.Meanwhile, the Banks family is controlled like clockwork by Mr. Banks (a perfectly cold and stuffy David Tomlinson, who turns 180 degrees over the movie's fast-paced 140 minutes.  (Cotton Warburton won an Editing Oscar.)  Glynis Johns is an ideal and likeable suffragette and feminist Mrs. Banks.  Mr. Banks works in the bank and constantly wants his kids to open a bank account, but they are always off playing with Mary Poppins or  Bert.MARY POPPINS is a fabulous feast of a movie, with some of the greatest visual effects and most beautiful matte paintings I have ever seen.  The cast is perfection, the writing something that even grouchy Pamela Travers should be pleased with.  And the 40th anniversary restoration on DVD has shimmeringly rich color, crystal-clear image clarity, and awesome 5.1 Home Theatre Mix THX sound to top any theater sound system.Disk 2 runs over three hours and includes composer Richard Sherman giving us deleted songs that ended up in other Disney animated movies, were cut for sheer length on a movie that runs almost two-and-a-half hours without them, and chats with Julie Andrews and Dick Andrews.  A full hour behind-the-scenes documentary shows how most of the magnificent visual effects were achieved, should you want the illusion spoiled.  We see the battle to get P.L. Travers to let Walt Disney film her precious baby of a novel over three full decades and working over the screenplay to make it all seamless plot-wise.  Finally, we have long lost footage of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre Los Angeles world premiere in August 1964 and various movie trailers for those who want to know how this very magical masterpiece was marketed.The two-disk 40th anniversary DVD of MARY POPPINS belongs in every house with kids--and kids at  heart.  With it, a hundred filmmaking aspects come together perfectly to create a masterpiece that gets my vote as Walt Disney's crowning film achievement.

$review_text.: This is a "B" movie in budget only.THAT means the actors are "unknown" and the effects are not up to the standards of a Summer Blockbuster with big name stars.The story and acting is good...and so are the effects when budget is kept in mind.The beginning of the movie shows a B-17 during a bombing mission. Disaster strikes...but it is only a glimpse of what the future of the war has in mind for the young men that crew the "Lucky Lass".Tears and laughter kind of live in the same bed during a war. Tempers and lives are quick to come and go.Fortress is a glimpse into the World of the young men of the USAAF. Attrition was about 2%...and a guy had to fly 25 missions before he could go home. That meant that your life was literally a coin toss.....50%...the odds of you living (or dying) were 50%.Is a very good movie in its own right.

$REVIEW.: The trailers for &quot;13th Warrior&quot; looked pretty exciting. But, this film about a poet forced to become a warrior (Antonio Banderas), is a waste of talent.The incoherent story makes almost no sense (apparantly there were editing problems) -- things happen way too fast and are never explained. This is the biggest flaw of many about this film.For other  . . . customers who are planning to see this film, don't. This movie  is a rip-off of Akira Kurosawa's &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. The battle  scenes in &quot;13th Warrior&quot; (and even some of the characters) are  stolen from that great samurai masterpiece.Avoid this unfocused piece of  rubbish and see &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, because that is an amazing film  with a coherent story and better effort put into it.

$REVIEW.: Stallone's response to Burt Young's question 'what do you see in my sister?' (Talia Shire) is kind of like Costner, drifting in an alcoholic fugue, the glory days as a Detroit Tiger (Denny McClain?) over, with the horribly emotionally wounded Joan Allen.This movie is reminiscent of the Diane Lane "Under the Tuscan Sun" story several years back. I found "Anger" much more engaging and was frankly bored by "Tuscan Sun."Part of that is due to Allen's brilliance and her ability to do more with what she was given than Lane was. And, frankly, Costner is better now aging than he was before saving the world and being heroic. I liked "For the Love of the Game" and I thought "Open Range" was one of the best westerns ever made.Here we deal with Allen's anger and the impact it has on her four daughters ranging from 15 to I imagine 23-24. Mike Binder knows that anger is like a drug and like a drug it allows us destructive self-pity and the excuse for not changing.Why Allen's husband disappeared is almost irrevelant as her rage is so close to the surface. That rage fuels the first 3/4ths of the movie.Costner plays sort of a sounding board and his accptance by the daughters as a friend-father-figure comes really earlier than his acceptance by Allen as a partner and a friend.My only criticism is that Binder does too much with the issues. The acting talents of the daughters are never really used and they drift from one crisis to another. Allen's 'my life just fell apart so let me be a psycho-witch' becomes tedious and her explosions, while brilliantly acted, causes one to wonder if her husband had the right idea.All of which is a credit to Allen and her own range. Here's a note on Costner. In both "Open Range" and "Anger" he acts a secondary role with brilliant actors (Duvall; Allen) and they draw from him his own deep talent. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury

$REVIEW.: Oh, dear, somebody thinks they're Guy Ritchie. Judging by the reviews of 'Swept Away', It's lucky somebody does. The two leads are incomprehensible so It's just as well they do most of their talking with their fists. Dumbest scene has the hero except a silver case after screwing up a job with some heavies. One sight of this and the global audience is yelling "it's a bomb!" But the coolest of the cool, one step ahead of everybody Transporter does not smell a rat. He obviously had not seen the old silver case ploy in 'Ronin'. But he shouldn't have to. "This film is fun" one of the film makers tells us in the special features. Yes, I love seeing two policemen murdered by the indirect actions of the dirtbag hero while carrying out their lawful duties. And the police chief just let's him off the hook? Bet that made him popular back at the squad room. Anything else? Yes, Jason Statham, get thee to stage school (he said at a discreet distance.)

 As a perfect counterweight to "Alexander," definitely do rent/buy "A Home at the End of the World," in which Farrell nicely pulls off a sensitive and even risky (to his macho image) role.Now, put that on the mantelpiece and line it up with two other recent roles as action hero ('The Recruit,' which I liked; and to anyone that didn't, I have two words: Bridget Moynahan) and the young tough (in the gotta-see "Intermission")


 That's an actor with some very impressive range.What I liked and took away - rather, what I hope others take away - from 'World' is: a family unit is what you make it

 It's a nice lesson to have reinforced every now and then.

$review_text.: While Cinderella is simpler and quieter than many other Disney features, the simplicity only adds to the beauty and magic of the movie


 The animation is frequently mesmorizing.True to form, Disney takes a universally known story, and adds characters full of personality to bring it to life
 Disney has always had a talent for developing loathsome villains, and Lady Tremain is among the most evil of them

 You can feel that she's bitter through to the core
 Many of the supporting characters lend a great deal of humor to the film

 Jacques and Gus are both hillarious and charming, and watching their exploits with Lucifer is a riot
 The poor Duke's interactions with the King are delightful, and the Fairy Godmother is quite a character.Cinderella herself is sugary sweet, and while she may not be the ideal role model for young girls in today's world of strong women, she is likeable and she shows us the value of friendship, hope, and faith.Cinderella includes a nice selection of original songs, including the adorable &quot;Cinderelly&quot;, the sweet &quot;So This is Love&quot;, and the classic &quot;A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes&quot;.This is a great choice for a movie to watch as a family, as it's entertaining for all ages, but it is simple enough and so innocent that your children can watch it by themselves and stay entertained time and time again.

$REVIEW.: Hordes of pilgrims flock to Shrewsbury's Abbey


The celebration of Cripples' Day promises healing from all mortal and spiritual wounds
Those who come seek a healing but in the midst of this dirty crowd a battered corpse is found in a sack.Just who this corpse is and why was he murdered is a mystery that only Brother Cadfael can solve or can he?This entertaining drama will hold you spellbound as Cadfael puzzles over the murder

The situation becomes more complex when three other pairs of pilgrims begin to add to the confusion
A young woman and her crippled brother are more than pilgrims and share some secrets
Two brothers, one of whom serves as an exemplary example of a penitent, have the favor of the Abbot
Then we have the slick merchant who is out to prey over the superstition of the pilgrims

Mix these elements together and you have a wild story of intrigue.The Pilgrim of Hate is more than a murder mystery

Through Cadfael's eyes we see meaningless suffering, misplaced guilt and the misuse of oaths to keep people entangled in emotional bondage


As the mystery unravels itself, so does the false &quot;spiritual&quot; modes of penance


Cadfael rightly declares that &quot;God doesn't require anymore...&quot; This is a captivating story and video presentation.

$REVIEW.: Howard Keel at the top of his form, with three co-stars who could really hit the high notes.  &#34;Annie Get Your Gun&#34; is worth the price alone, with rarely-seen numbers by Judy Garland before she was dropped by MGM that will give you a chance to compare Judy's performance with Betty Hutton's.  And all discs are closed caption for the hearing impaired.  Great.

$review_text.: The Island was released as a summer `blockbuster' movie but surprisingly, did not do well at the box office in spite of good reviews from the critics. Ewan Mcgregor stars alongside Scarlett Johansson, Steve Buscemi and Sean Bean, certainly big enough names to whet the appetite and to indicate a film worth seeing.McGregor plays Lincoln Six Echo, a man living in the sterile, self-contained city that lies beneath the Earth that was supposedly ravaged by contaminants and rendered uninhabitable. Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) is his friend although any close relationships are strongly discouraged. Life in this world is strictly controlled and anyone deviating from the `norm' faces a visit to sinister Dr Merrick (Bean). The only ray of hope in the citizen's lives is to win the lottery. Winners are sent to The Island, the last uncontaminated place on earth where people can live free and breath fresh air. Lincoln Six Echo starts to question his existence, becoming increasingly unsettled; this concern is rapidly increased when Jordan wins the lottery. He snoops around before she has to leave and what he discovers about `the island' sends him and Jordan fleeing from the safety of their world to the outside. A crack team of mercenaries, hired by Merrick, are sent to capture and return the fugitives.The Island is a fast paced, action filled, special effects packed movie and certainly a high quality production that deserved better recognition than it got, Any fan of action films (not just sci-fi) should enjoy this. The downside of the DVD is the lack of extras but this seems to increasingly be the norm, as distributors seem to delight in bringing out `special' editions several months later to encourage buyers to part with more money. The only extras are subtitles, theatrical trailer and a `making of' featurette. The quality of picture and sound are, however, of excellent quality so unless you are desperate for extra features I would go ahead and get the film now, it's worth parting with your pennies for.

$REVIEW.: Read some good things about this movie, so I bought the DVD on a lark

$15 down the drain

Apart from the opening sequence, which showed some real promise, I can't understand how anyone could call this lumbering beast a great movie
Painfully slow, as it introduces the main characters with minimal dialog - a lot of people staring at one another

An undistinguished plot that is leisurely revealed, cumulating in a big nothing

Another cookie cutter storyline, the sort that put the western on life support before Clint and Costner made it respectable again


I never believed for a minute in any of these characters

(*Spoilers*) Charles Bronson's motivation is not revealed until the end of the film, and it has nothing to do with the rest of the story


Tacked on justification for his inexplicable behavior


Jason Robarts ultra-lame death scene is laughable
Particularly after he must have been wounded for quite some time and gave no indication that he was injured in his previous scene


Henry Fonda is an effective bad guy, until he opened his mouth

His characteristic drawl is forever linked to the likes of `On Golden Pond' and `Mister Roberts' and no steely blue eyes or two day stubble can change that


The only high point is some interesting camera work

Unfortunately that is only one piece to a very incomplete puzzle

This film does not even belong on the same shelf with `A Fistful of Dollars' or `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'

I was wondering why I had never seen it before

$review_text.: Since when are the oscars giving the good awards to the good artists ? ? I had completely giving up on the academy since the "A BEAUTIFUL MIND" disaster. Best Director and best film the year David Lynch helmed Mulholland Drive !!So, I was watching the Oscars the other night (Chris rock OK but so out of place),and at that time i hadn't seen MILLION DOLLAR BABY 5film got out in march in France). Quite frankly, despite the fact that I thought "The Aviator" was within the three worst Scorcese Films of all time (the two others being "Gangs of NY" and "Bringing out the dead"), I was hoping that they would give him an Oscar so that he would finally stop to be such a "good boy" and do the film Hollywood are expecting him to do. In his unnerving quest to be so loved, scorcese has forgotten what made his talent, his cynicism. "Please give him something so that he will do goods movies again" i was yelling in fornt of my scren but they finnally gave ot to Clint. Again.And then I saw Million dollar Baby. I am 6foot1, 240 pounds. I was crying for the last hour of the movie, and again for two hours afterwards.MDB is for sure for now the best film of this century, probably Eastwood's best. Where did Eastwood found inside of him, this somber pain, this gentle despair. How can someone so painfully describe the depths of a man's soul.I never saw an audience gasp like when Eastwood gives the meaning of the two Irish words that everybody in the room was waiting for. Everone was waiting for this moment to happen, but everybody in the room couldn't stop crying.Eastwood is like a boxer, we know he is gonna hit us, we know how he's gonna hit us, but still it hurts. He found news ways to show us the gentle and the painful, the other side of the American Dream the lengths of solitude.As an actor, I always thought eastwood was bad but here he is for once is not acting too bad, when we see tears rolling down his grand canyon of a face, well it is breaking our hearts, over and over. Freeman is like always, honest.Hillary Swank is beyond everything I have seen. Giving her the Oscar is almost an understatement. She's the part, she breaks your heart. She's so remarkable; I wonder how she got away from this movie unarmed.Eastwood is giving, movie after movie, incredible presents to his actors. STREEP, WHITAKER, HACKMAN, even COSTNER for godsakes, were at their best with him. (I didn't like too much PENN in River but, well, he got away with an Oscar, right?)Eastwood is gently (again this word) giving us incredible films that we will remember forever. I thought he would never outperformed his 90's trilogy (MADISON, PERFECT WORLD, UNFORGIVEN), and quite frankly some of the late movies were a bit lazy.Million Dollar Baby is a gift to the audiences and I had forgotten how pleasant it was to leave a theater aftr having cried for 30 minutes.Thank you Clint.
$SUMMARY.: So perfect it hurts. One of the best movies ever.

$REVIEW.: Danny Kaye plays a stodgy and reclusive music professor who is working with a group of similar doddering oldsters who are attempting to catalog the roots of music from the ancient past to the present, but due to their ivory tower studies, they've missed the big band, bebop, rag and jazz sensations that were sweeping the nation in the early part of the 20th century. Virginia Mayo is the moll of a local gangster who needs a hideout to lay low in and stumbles on the mansion where the musical research and recording is going on, meets Danny and his long-hair group, and exposes them to these modern rhythms, changing the direction of their work considerably.The music performances are terrific and don't bog the flow of the movie. The comedy is typical Danny Kaye and delightful without getting too silly. The improbable love story between Kaye and Mayo actually works and is cute. This is an unusual case where the remake is better than the original movie.A treat is that big band leader and clarinetist Benny Goodman appears as one of the professors, and provides a quite acceptable performance both as a book-wormish scholar, and as a musician who discovers he's got jazz chops he didn't know he had.Mayo plays her usual voluptuous self, the glamorous and sophisticated showgirl on the lam.This is a classic light movie that showcases some great musical talent and is very entertaining. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: I was introduced to Silent Hill 3 by my roommate, who was a huge horror buff.  He had nearly every horror flick you could imagine, and the games to go with them.  Posters around the room foretold the end of the world.  Yet, all of this combined paled in comparison to the experience of playing Silent Hill 3, which made the grotesque look amicable, and made Jason or Freddy Krueger look like your after-school music teacher (which may be good or bad, depending on your music teacher).  I still remember how, while running through a subway corridor, the green/brown walls all of a sudden began to pulsate and drip with blood, only to return back to the sewage-filled, rusted facade three seconds later upon reaching the end of the cooridor.  We both looked at each other, and said "WTF"!I tell this to the readers who are either new to Silent Hill, or have played the game.  To both readers, the above description is basically the "allure" of this franchise - you will have never seen such displays of utter horror - and this movie will not disappoint.  After watching this movie, all I will say is that I will never think the same way about an air siren again.To the former, it ends there.  The plot is skeletal, enough to justify the amazing scenery, and enough to please gamers who have immersed themselves into Silent Hill lore.  You will not find Oscar-winning acting, nor much rhyme or reason.  You may even be slightly annoyed (as I was) when the screen turns white, and someone begins a narration with "Congratulations..." as if you had just beaten a game, and are watching the ending.  My advice to you is to basically sit back, and prepare for a visual nightmare which has, until now, yet to erupt onto the big screen.To the latter, I really think everything good about the game is in this movie.  The plot may make a little more sense, and the similarities of Sean Bean to the Silent Hill 2 protagonist, and Rosa to the Silent Hill 3 protagonist, are uncanny.  There's even a mention of Alessa and "rebirth", which were central to the plot in 3.  The characteristic "snow" pervades the street-level, and the sick and unforgiving nightmare of the hospital is prominantly displayed.I give this movie 4 stars, and I'll tell a story to justify it:I saw my roommate playing Silent Hill 3, and I still remember him going through the church.  The map, the MAP, out of all things, spooked me so much that when I played it myself, I never got past the hospital.  The map is an innocent child's drawing of the church, and the juxtaposition of that with the climax of the nightmare that is Silent Hill 3 was a bit too much for me.  This movie does not come close to drawing out that kind of response from me - I'm sure due to the mainstream appeal of this movie - and for that reason, I cannot justify giving it a higher rating.  I saw this with both eyes open throughout the entire movie, and outside of those damned air sirens, found myself more fascinated than spooked.  Of course, my opinion may change while watching this movie alone in the dark...

$REVIEW.: June 8, 2003Tokyo, JapanAnother great Pride fight card and another night of great fights.Nino "Elvis" Schembri vs. Kazuhiro Hamanaka:Schembri is fresh off of his upset victory over Sakuraba. Hamanaka is making his Pride debut. This fight has some very good action and Schembri shows some of the same great knees that stopped Sakuraba. He constantly pulls guard when he gets into trouble, which is annoying and also stalls the action temporarily. This is a very close fight until the 3rd round, when it truly gets interesting.Anderson "Spider Man" Sliva vs. Daijyu Takase:Silva is making waves in Pride by this time. He is expected to walk through Takase. Takase dedicates the fight to a man who is suffering through a terrible disease and he does far better than is expected of him. Silva looks out of sorts in this fight. Almost the whole fight takes place on the ground and it ends there, also.Alistair Overeem vs. Mike Bencic:This one ends in exciting fashion with a flying strike in the first.Quinton "Rampage" Jackson vs. Mikhail Ilokhine:Mikhail looks stiff coming into this fight, whereas Jackson looks determined and unwaivering, as usual. In this bout, we actually see Jackson lift Mikhail up from the guard and attempt a slam. This is not something I'd ever seen before, but that is the kind of fighter Rampage Jackson is: exciting, very talented and very different. He tries things that other fighters don't even think of. Rampage gets this fight to the feet after spending some time on the ground. Here, he almost ends it, but Mikhail falls through the ropes to escape the barrage. Rampage takes over... He tough-talks Wanderlei Silva after the fight, commenting on Silva's shoving him in the ring after his win over Kevin Randleman. He goes at Silva hard, verbally, which will stir "The Axe Murderer", I'm sure.Emelianenko Fedor vs. Kazuyuki Fujita:This is an exciting fight!!! For the first time, we see Fedor get rocked. How does he handle it? It he a TRUE champion? It is all revealed in this fight. A must-see!Mirko CroCop vs. Heath "Texas Crazy Horse" Herring:This is a great matchup that I was hoping to see for a while. Herring comes out a bit overexcited. CroCop remains calm and eludes Herring's attacks, before beginning to launch his own offense. There are a lot of kicks thrown in this fight and it is a kick to a very specific area of the body that ends up stopping the fight. Awesome striking display. Great fight!Mark "The Hammer" Coleman vs. Don "The Predator" Frye:This is a rematch 7 years in the making. Frye lost to Coleman the first time around. Frye trains for this fight with Frank Shamrock, hoping to get the edge this time. There is a good buildup to this fight - perhaps too much. The fight itself is a slow-paced battle for positioning. The fight doesn't have any distinguishable high points. The man who wins simply does just enough to squeak out the win. Nothing too interesting and I would call it something of a letdown.Great bonus footage, as always. I highly recommend this DVD.

$review_text.: ...Rocky won best picture at the 1976 Academy Awards anddeservedly so.  The film is a study of a lonely man trapped in anunforgiven city who doesn't pretend who he is not.  The film is brilliantly directed by John Avildsen and backed by an emotionally charged soundtrack written by Bill Conti.  Rocky is an inspiring film rooted in one man's goals and limitations.  Balboa's character traits dominate the film.  We are uninterested if he has any siblings, parents, or friends; the focus is on Balboa's struggle for acceptance and identity within society.  The fight premise is based on former heavyweight unknown Chuck Wepner (The Bayonne Bleeder) and his bout with then heavyweight champ Muhammed Ali.  The Ali- Wepner bout lasted a suprising 15 rounds, highlighted by Wepner's dramatic knockdown of Ali in the 8th round.  Ali rose and went on to win via a decision as did Apollo Creed, but in both instances the decisions were anti-climatic.  Unknown white heavyweights are not supposed to last 15 rounds against the greatest heavyweight champs real or imagined. Rocky's struggle to reveal Adrian's fear of living brings about his own insecurities and failures.  When Balboa gets his title shot he knows that he cannot win, but reconciles that his mere courage and manhood will transcend the outcome of the fight.  The film contains poignant and introspective scenes that open up Balboa's screen presence without annoying voice-overs or histrionic flashbacks. When Balboa picks up a picture of himself as a boy, we need not know about boyhood stories, the story is parlayed in Rocky's adult face.The scene where the cantankerous Micky humbly comes to Rocky's apartment asking for redemption is emotionally draining.  When Balboa explodes and Micky exits, we have an inclination of what might happen next. The brief reconciliation between the thick necked loser and father time is shot from a distance without any audible dialogue.  This distant shot on a cold, dark, Philadelphia street needs no dialogue; it is one of the most engrossing frames in the film. Even the turtle pets in Balboa's apartment reveal his hardened surface and nonthreatening underside. Balboa may look intimidating as a collector with his black leather coat, black hat, and black cut out gloves; but his reluctance to break an overdue bettor's thumb reveals more about the man than his attire.  Balboa's revelations with Paulie, Adrian, Gazzo, and Micky are the essence of the movie.  The fight between Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed serves as the canvas for Rocky's emotional, physical, and psychological emergence.  I had the pleasure of meeting Chuck Wepner some years ago, he is a successful liquor salesman.  Why couldn't Rocky Balboa be as lucky?  END

I have been waiting for a long time for this movie to come out and I was let down


For one the acting was horrible, the screen play wasn't great and it just wasn't scary, at all
The whole movie looked low budget, which it was, but they could have done a better job with it
The only redeeming things about the movie are the premise, which is great, and the ending, which had a twist
Other then that, not good, if you want to see it, wait till DVD, it not worth seeing in theaters, I'm sad to say.

It's my husband's opinion that they are there so that men will watch the movie.  The other problem is that this version is trying so hard to be politically correct that it bends Shakespeare's meaning to suit a twenty-first century audience.

$review_text.: I dunno what show you people are reviewing, but it is obviously Season 1 (brilliant masterpiece), and not Season 2 (tepid cliche) of "Breaking Bad."The character development, dark humor, nail-biting suspense, and ingenious plot devices... all gone, replaced by an endless segue from "soap drama moment to soap drama moment." Look at the actors, they -know- it's dreck they are phoning in. Tell me you can't see it in almost every scene.Completely extraneous subplots are introduced (Skyler's work flirtation, ill-fated romance between Jesse and "OD waiting to happen" girl) that add -nothing- to the basic premises developed so well in Season 1 other than perhaps to appeal to the teenaged female vampire melodrama set. In fact, the gripping, absurdly believable "dying chemistry teacher meth cook" premise is all but back-burnered while we get to watch "touching" scenes of Sonograms, young flirtation and love, endless cancer conferences (yay! feelgood moment!), and endlessly verbose hyper-dialogue drama moments one can almost hear an "awww!" "booo!" or "tada!" after.To add insult to injury whoever wrote this mess decided that a highly coincidental plane crash needed to be added in as opposed to developing the very solid core concepts Season 1 was laden with. They could have put this show on auto-pilot by continuing awesome themes from Season 1 (boorishness of the bro in law, kleptomania of the sis in law, interaction with students in class v meth cook, ballsy use of dark side MacGuyver type tech to screw a-holes over... all interesting and smart, all tossed away inexplicably in favor of pure formulaic dreck).Instead they neutered a masterpiece and drained every loving ounce of testosterone out of the show. Don't be fooled by viral marketing shills posting "objective" reviews here, three stars is a stretch for this tedious snooze, I gave it two because it is so very obvious that many of the fives are shall we say "bought and sold."

$review_text.: "City of Men" is a feature film version of a blockbuster series that ran on Brazilian TV from 2002 to 2005. It is also a sequel of sorts to the earlier "City of God," an award-winning movie directed by Fernando Meirelles.Paul Morelli's "City of Men" focuses on Laranjinha (Darlan Cunha) and Acerola (Douglas Silva), two honorable teens who are struggling to make a decent life for themselves in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.  The former is searching for the father he's never known, while the latter is only beginning to learn what it means to be a father to his own son.  Their personal story is set against the backdrop of a violent turf-war between two rival gangs that are battling it out for preeminence in the city."City of Men" reveals its origins as a TV series in the novelistic approach it takes to storytelling and character development.  From the beginning, we feel as if we have been thrust into the midst of a story "already in progress."  With little explanatory background, the screenplay (by Elena Soarez) introduces us all at once to a multiplicity of characters, whose relationships with one another we are forced to pick up almost on the fly as it were.  This allows us to become both an observer of and an active participant in the drama that unfolds.Certainly, one of the most important characters in the movie is the city itself, since it is this very environment of poverty, hopelessness and violence that, in large measure, determines the kinds of lives these people will lead and the types of futures they will have.Morelli's directorial style is up-close-and-personal in the more intimate moments, and vivid and exciting in the pulse-pounding "action" sequences.  The sense of immediacy that he and cinematographer Adriano Goldman bring to the work acts as an effective counterweight to some of the more melodramatic elements that creep into the screenplay towards the end.With excellent performances and a surprising amount of optimism given its generally depressing milieu and setting, "City of Men" is a tale of friendship and adult responsibility that will move the spirit and touch the heart.

$review_text.: Have you ever wondered why most horror films are so awful these days? Let's take a look back into 2005, one of the worst years in the history of cinema

A year in which the majority of the films that came out were really bad
This was one of them and went down as one of the worst horror films of all time (A score of 9 out of 100 on Metacritic), which is ironic because in the same year we saw one of the best horror films ever made, The Descent


Since 2005, Hollywood has not recovered and continues to deliver a lot of awful films
Uwe Boll, I'm willing to defend the House of the Dead film you made, but only because it was so bad it was hilarious
Alone in the Dark on the other hand is one of the worst horror films ever created

This film makes House of the Dead look like a glorious George A
Romero zombie film

Here's what the film is; take Alien, take Resident Evil, and take AVP, butcher the hell out of them, stitch them together and call it Alone in the Dark

It doesn't even have the "so bad it's good" vibe going for it

This film easily lands itself a spot in my top five worst films I've ever seen list

Now let's review this horrendous film.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: You know the film from the beginning is going to be an atrocious mess when you have to read a long line of text that is narrated to you because test audiences complained they didn't understand the plot (Though I'm pretty sure that wasn't their only complaint)


10,000 years ago, the Abkani people were an advanced race of people who mysteriously disappeared overnight after letting an evil force of mysterious creatures loose
The film's main focus is on Edward Carnby, played by washed up and long-forgotten actor Christian Slater
Edward Carnby had a rough childhood, he grew up in an orphanage and was experimented on by a mysterious organization


Fast forward years later into adulthood, and Edward Carnby is a paranormal investigator who searches for remnants of the lost civilization
The story is also focuses on an archaeologist named Aline Cedrac; played by Tara Reid (The worst actress I've ever seen) who just so happens to be Carnby's ex-girlfriend

 When a mysterious artifact is salvaged from the bottom of the ocean and opened the creatures once again roam the Earth
Now all the children (Who are now adults) who were experimented on at Carnby's orphanage are going missing because they are infected and are becoming the creatures


Now Carnby and Cedrac, with the help of Carnby's rival government agent Richard Burke; played by Stephen Dorff must stop these creatures by means of shooting them in a bunch of lame action scenes and investigate the remnants and artifacts


A series of horribly scripted plot twists occur from then on.MUSIC: This was one of the only redeeming qualities of such a horrendous horror flick


It actually has a nice score to it.ACTING: Oh my God


This film contains some of the worst acting in the history of cinema


Christian Slater's performance is utterly atrocious to watch and plagued by horrifically bad dialogue


Tara Reid's acting is even more appalling
The only thing worse than her acting is her cottage cheese thighs and a$$
Stephen Dorff's acting is slightly better, but that's not exactly saying anything

Most ironic of all, is the fact that two actors from House of the Dead appear in this film despite the overwhelmingly negative reception of the film


That right there seems to suggest that these actors sold their souls to Uwe Boll, there for never earning another role in anything again
If you play in a Uwe Boll film, you're lucky to get a role in a crappy sitcom that won't even last two months on the air
These actors had their careers officially destroyed by this film, and now they will never get a respectable role in anything ever again
No part of the acting is believable and it seemed as if the actors had to improvise at times
It makes the House of the Dead actors worthy of Oscars compared to this.ACTION: If you thought the Matrix-style/martial arts action in House of the Dead was bad, this film makes it look like a brilliantly choreographed action flick
The gore is the only good part of the badly scripted action scenes

The film is loaded with bad camera angles and they obscure the action scenes
Not to mention, most of the action scenes don't even make much sense like the car chase at the beginning of the film

Worst of all, the shooting scenes in the film are boring to watch (How the hell do you accomplish this?)
This film also runs into the problem of being too dark to see (Think about the awful AVP: Requiem film, but much worse!)


The creature designs look like reject alien creatures from the Alien films
The CGI in this film isn't the worst, but it certainly is bad and poorly done

For an action-horror flick it's really boring and utterly atrocious
Oh, this film is also the 23rd zombie film I've watched because it does feature the zombies, and it's earned the nomination as worst zombie film I've ever seen, on top of being one of the worst films I've ever seen.OVERALL: Don't even think about it


This film is an abomination of man who's only home should be in landfills or your garbage can


This film will die in the bargain bin.THE GOOD: The music and the gore.THE BAD: Everything else.

Tunney performed excellently as a victim of such a horrific crime. She possesses a personal quality not only making her a great actor but giving her the ability to transform herself into that role. The Writer/Director, Mia Goldman, being a victim herself many years prior to the making of this movie,("Open Window") expressing in her own words a very emotional story only adding an certain understanding of the part being portrayed by Tunney.

$review_text.: Have you ever seen a film where a really great actor or actress pulled the weight of a miscast but beautiful/handsome partner?  Sometimes it flops, sometimes it flies. In Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, it flies. Surinder (Shahrukh Khan)'s love interest, Taani (Anushka Sharma) offers a relief from the parade of Bollywood film actresses that have airbrushed, transitory good looks, with questionable dancing and acting abilities. She does an excellent job of portraying genuine happiness. However, she falls a bit short of believability with portraying "flamboyant, fun-loving, and vivacious" portraying rather, petulant, erratic and careless behavior ... sometimes puppies just aren't that interesting.  To get to the heavier acting, she's also not that convincing with grief, unless you believe having someone sit on a bed and feign crying and gazing off into the curtains suffices for a portrayal of the loss of a loved one. She possesses a beautiful smile, a Bollywood-ready figure and she really pulled off her happy dancing moves!She's a new talent, and may be going places after this smash hit, too soon to tell.The fact that the lead actor, Shahrukh Khan, is much older than his leading lady is muted and explained by the initial sequence where his mentor makes our hero promise to marry his daughter. It helps that Shahrukh Khan looks so young and is in great shape, otherwise its Harrison Ford-land with an incredibly young starlet swept off her feet by daddy/granddaddy. Surinder Sahni passes as a credible "love interest".Our hero, Surinder Sahni is a very dull but loyal character. He falls for Taani instantly, and offers us glimpses of unrequited, painful love. He's got a great guy friend, Bobby (Vinay Pathak) who gives Surinder great outfits, hair styles, and how-to-be-macho advice, as well as the loan of his smokin' motorcycle. Surinder stumbles upon the path of dual identity, and becomes polar opposite as a braggart, flashy annoyance named Raj. The charade ultimately results in resolution and a merger of the personality split. Love conquers all, no giving-away-of-the-story here.The imagination of Bollywood leaves behind all the grime and grit of the streets, offering up filmi set scenes, and people prancing around in outfits, that I've never seen anyone in India, ever wearing, oh except when Brittany Spears went hang out with her choreographer, Sandip Soparrkar, in Dec. 2008, when Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi was a smash hit in Mumbai theaters.The beautiful Golden Temple scenes, and the devotion of the characters praying lends quite depth, not to be found much in similar fantasy films from the West. The "dark night of the soul" when Surinder gets drunk with his guy friend, Bobby, and talks to a mannequin, comes off as vapid, and clich&eacute;d; a potentially soul-filled moment is lost.The film would be a five-star film in the theatre with all the glitz and glamour. As a DVD, it retains the five stars because of the Disc 2 extras. In addition to being able to watch the dance scenes again and again, the special features include a magnificent interview with Shahrukh Khan candidly describing his mental process with his character, his relationship with the other actors and director. Get ready for some quality, one-on-one time with this Super Nova.

$review_text.: I give this three stars.Minus one for the wedding/reception scene being toooo long. It was well done and all, but still WAY too long.Minus another star, because parts of the plot made absolutely no sense. I'm not going to go all into that, because other people have complained enough about it, in good detail.Walken and DeNiro are great in this movie. Also, while some people thought they didn't "show enough Vietnam", I thought the time they took to instead build up the characters and their relationships with each other was very well done.This movie is worth seeing for anyone, and obviously worth owning for any fan of DeNiro or Walken.One last thing that I found hilarious: --->(SPOILERS)&lt;--- in the VA hospital when Mike goes to see Steven, Steven shows Mike all this cash that his wife at home has been receiving from someone in Saigon. Steven's wife Angela then gives it to Steven, hidden in balled-up socks. SOCKS! The man has no legs.... I don't know if they did that on purpose to be funny, but I roffled.

$review_text.: Intended as the pilot for a new series, this tv movie tested very poorly and wasn't picked up; not even as a mid-season replacement, which is telling.Opens as a 12-person crew is set to attempt humanity's first interstellar voyage, traveling to the star nearest our own sun. The catch: The spaceship Phaeton and its associated costs have been "sponsored" by a global consortium of corporations and businesses. To help defray their investment, the crew, a mix of scientists and cultural specialists, have agreed to be filmed reality-television style; their ten-year journey captured, edited and broadcast for a weekly show dependent on ratings and advertising.As they approach the final countdown to their go/no-go decision, a bizarre multitude of problems suddenly crop up - culminating in the death one of the crew. Was he the victim of circumstance a.k.a. bad luck, or is there something more sinister behind it? Can the remaining members continue under the scrutiny of the cameras, stuck in space for a decade with nowhere to go or escape, all while balancing the fear that one of their mates might be a psychopathic murderer?Sound silly? Sort of, because it's a bit like one of the 'Airport' movies.Would I have followed the show? No. For the exact same reason why I detest the unreality of Big Brother = contrived drama and the participation of self-indulgent narcissists. To be fair, the fictional crew of space travelers in 'Virtuality' aren't made up of the typical conniving megalomaniacs that normally populate such programs. But that's small comfort since, in some ways, they're worse.Reason: I can't begin to understand or imagine how most of the crew were selected. As many as a third have noticeable personality disorders, the others seem borderline incompetent. Would anyone really stock such a dangerous journey with these kinds of people? Would you invest so much effort and funds on a formula destined to fail?Or was that the point? And was the Commander's final scene a reference to a 'Total Recall' twist?Additionally, I question the producers and their thought processes: What market were they hoping to tap into? I'm actually more curious about whether or not research indicated that scifi fans also watch worthless shows like Big Brother or The Housewives Of Fill-In-The-Blank?Would dismiss the suggestion outright as pure absurdity, if I hadn't seen wrestling on the SciFi Channel. Which I can honestly say is one of the most surreal moments of so-called entertainment I have ever experienced.Clearly some freakishly twisted Venn diagram suggests the scifi/fantasy community and wrestling fans share some commonality. But I honestly cannot imagine what it could be.Seriously - wrestling?!&lt;shrug>So perhaps there was the tiniest iota of an idea here after all. But I can't conceive of what that might be.And even though the character clich&eacute;s were numerous, I did enjoy the production values, which were really good. No surprise as I'm a fan of Ronald Moore and Michael Taylor, the guys behind the rebooted 'Battlestar Galactica' and 'Caprica'. But I can't in good conscience say "I liked the show" just because it looked nice.Overall, one can see the pair attempting a similar effort as BSG, but most of the characters of Virtuality were not accessible, too damaged, or flat-out too abrasive to engage. Could they have turned it around, smoothed out the edges? Maybe. If so, the cast deserved at least that chance.Note:- Cast member Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (as the Mission Commander) would find much greater success in the past. You might've heard of this show, 'Game of Thrones'.

$review_text.: Much as we hate to admit, we want to be scared, that's why we watch the horror genre, and it's because of the high suspension of disbelief factor that we end up also seeing comic send-ups of the genre
The good news is that grand-master of comedy Zucker seems to be trying to get back more of the feeling of dead-on hits from earlier in his spoof career like the Airplane movies, Hot Shots, and Naked Gun

It's just too bad that elements from earlier in the scary movie franchise still haven't been entirely excised from the scary movie formula

In 4, the jokes that are arguably 'on', are more 'on' than in any of the scary movie series


And there are definitely a huge amount of 'on' jokes

But there's still also too much that makes it feel like just as scary movie 4 is  hitting it's stride toward comedic greatness, it's reigned back down a few notches
Plus, unlike the previous Scary Movies, there just wasn't enough spoofing going on
In earlier iterations, you could pick out jokes from literally a dozen or more sources, in 4 it seemed to just be spoofing three movies continuously, with an occasional pop culture reference thrown in
Come on, there have been TONS of scare-fests both good and bad that easily could have been targeted for pokes in the ribs

Scary Movie 5 has been a long time in speculation and I hope that the extra time means more of a comedic blood bath for horror fans to chuckle at
I'm ready to laugh, and even if you hated any or all of the scary movie series, you, like me, will plunk you butt down in a dark theater to giggle once more

$REVIEW.: First, potential viewers need to know that this film has what feels like a long beginning that includes high school partying and teenage relationships. Perhaps it was deemed necessary for the set up of the story but the opening would definitely appeal more to teens than mature viewers. The school assignment scenes involving the two main characters could have used a bit more elaboration. Less time partying and more time studying, with a bit more time spent on researching the assigned topic before the two make their discovery might have improved the beginning.If you make it through the beginning of the film, you will be treated to action, suspense, explosions, clever planning on the part of the youthful main characters, interesting though unlikely story, characters that appear trustworthy and some not so much.

B-17 Bombers that are enroute from the states to Pearl Harbor and run into the surprise attack by Japanese  December 7, 1941.  They do what they can in the fight, but many are shot down and are waved off by the base command to fly on to other bases in the Pacific. Unfortuntely, they find those bases also under attack.  They are forced to crash land in the Philippines.  The crew, now grounded, continue the fight on foot. This is gallant patriot effort.

$REVIEW.: It will always remain beyond me how such a breathtaking work of art was both kept on the shelves for two years, killing its chances of wide Awards recognition, and sold off as a mindless, heartless action flick derived from the mind of Quentin Tarantino and the "skill" of Jet Li, rather then giving those who deserve most of the credit any notice (i.e. director Zhang Yimou, the beautiful and talented Maggie Cheung, the profound Tony Leung). Also, though the action doesn't surprise me, I'll forever be disappointed in the media's constant need to compare it with 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' another martial arts film that is similar in nature, but not in structure, execution, or story.Let's get that part straightened out: just because both 'Crouching Tiger' and 'Hero' are from the same nation, are both action-oriented films, and both include Zhang Ziyi in its supporting cast does not by any means make them at all comparable to each other. At each's core is an immensely different film. I will end this discussion of the two here, because I don't want to fall in that trap of irrelevant comparison as a cop-out.'Hero' is first and foremost profound. Its imagery, characters, action sequences, and reality vs. internal portrayal storyline all interconnect with astounding cohesiveness, never separating from each other, working back and forth to create one of the best films of the year. Never once did I lose track of what the film was saying, or its nuanced emotional power. Most felt disconnected from it, but when you allow yourself to be embedded into the complexity of the human story (executed brilliantly with a finely crafted screenplay), 'Hero' immediately becomes three-dimensional, unfolding into something much more than an on-the-surface, mediocre war drama.If you happen to find Foreign films abysmal, forcing you to concentrate a bit too hard for your tastes, still take the time to see 'Hero.' It is most famous for its equally deep imagery. You know you're seeing something mind blowing and revelatory when a character's robes blowing in the wind are as accurately choreographed as Maggie Cheung fending off a barrage of arrows.What further elevates 'Hero's standing as a great film is its precise and intelligent use of its beauty. It is not simply appealing to the eye for the sake of having astounding visuals. The colors work into the story, changing as its two central characters, Nameless (Jet Li) and the King of Quin (Daoming Chen), reflect on their own interpretations of Nameless' explanation as to how he defeated three notorious assassins --Broken Sword (Tony Leung), Long Sky (Donnie Yen), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung)-- that have been out for the King's blood for years after he had massacred their people. The colors --red, blue, green, and white-- not only distinguish the separate versions visually, but also distill each's emotional foundation, causing the experience of watching this film to be much more involving.I should not focus too much on the imagery, however. If you enter the film concentrating on the visuals alone, you may risk distraction, ultimately ruining this particular cinematic experience. I highly recommend this film, but I advise those who are interested to keep its themes of inner conflict, abuse of power, and the hindrance of paranoia in mind. Luckily, Zhang Yimou has done such a fantastic job honing, polishing, and crafting this film, processing it may not be too difficult for some. The combination of this subtle emotional power, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung's masterful performances, Yimou's heartfelt direction, and Christopher Doyle's finely detailed cinematography proves to be one of the most satisfying, memorable, and epic experiences I've had at the theater in years.

I did not find it especially entertaining as it was very much "by the book" in the traditional PBS sense


I would have preferred that we had heard more from the actual people that were there rather than so many acaademics and relatives of those who it was about

Also, I know so many others have said it as well, but way too many movie clips and you never knew what you were looking at


People were not identified, etc


But, I applaud them for taking the time to make it and for putting it all down
Still better to have this than not to have done it.NOTE: I thoroughly enjoyed the extra interview footage
It is actually more entertaining and enlightening than the actual series


I wonder what they must still have and what they might have done with it?

$REVIEW.: With a wonderful cast, a meticulous script and an eternal story of battling against great odds, Seabiscuit is about as perfect as a movie can get.Writer-director Gary Ross allows this inspirational to develop on and off the track, the a real gem is the racing sequences, which place the viewer in the saddle of this oftentimes very rugged & brutal sport. The final race scene - as Seabiscuit takes aim for one more glorious victory - is worth the price of this two-CD set.Of particular interest in the additional material is the complete footage of the match-race between The Biscuit and War Admiral.This is an outstanding set which provides additional insight into the development of the film and why The Biscuit captured the hearts of a nation so many years ago and continues to captivate fans in the 21st Century.

$REVIEW.: An Amazing and entertaining behind the scenes look at Universal Studios' masterpiece remake "KING KONG" From the first shot to the last day, Peter Jackson takes through the biggest detail to the smallest. It's the most terrific behind the scenes I've ever seen, from the smallest leave in a Skull Island jungle to the very top of the Empire State Building. With the cast and Crew all on this treasure trove, Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow, Jack Black as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll and Andy Serkis performing the movements and facial expressions of "the Eighth Wonder of the World" "KING KONG" The DVD even features a behind the scenes look at the Kong and Rex battle, from the storyboard to the final results in the finished film. If your a Kong fan and movie buff like me, then most defintley buy this treasure trove. Jackson's the greatest director of our time.

$REVIEW.: It's difficult to make a movie about childhood and the teen years. When we're young, the world is a small and emotionally charged place in which mad things are taken for normal. It's a world of miniatures that seem huge and it's a claustrophobic place. All this is difficult to capture in a movie. Yet this movie succeeds brilliantly through a combination of outstanding camera work and deft direction and editing.Blanche Baker is superb as the small-scale Eichmann who vents her bitterness and frustration on the two girls in her care. She hits just the right note: neither underplaying nor overplaying her role. The "look-the-other-way" tendency of humanity was particularly in evidence in 50s American suburbia and that's also captured here with great subtlety yet force, in a way that reinforces the quiet insanity of "Aunt Ruth". Everything conspires to enable the abuser and disempower the abused.It's easy to understand why many people have difficulty in watching this movie. Unlike most of the schlock churned out by Hollywood, this has real emotional impact and it is about real-world events. The scene in which Aunt Ruth sadistically beats the helpless crippled child for whom she's supposed to be caring is authentically gut-wrenching in a way that no amount of fake-blood-Rambo-violence-stock-movie-effect can ever hope to approach. Everything here is with the volume turned down. It's the evil of banality, the evil of small but insidious things.One reviewer wrote that maybe some things shouldn't be the subject of movies but I disagree. If we don't acknowledge the evil we're all capable of, we won't try to prevent it from happening. As many scientific studies have shown, most people have the capacity for genuine evil within them. We all harbor the concentration camp guard or the exploiter within us. When society lacks the mechanisms to keep such behavior in check, it's all too easy for insigificant, insecure, embittered and inadequate individuals to become monsters. This is a movie about private hell and it's a salutary lesson for us all.

$review_text.: Movie - 4.5Having just seen this movie for the first time at the time of writing this, I'm amazed and shocked
 Amazed at how great a film this is, and shocked at why I never bothered to watch it until now
Steven Spielberg has long been a favorite of mine when it comes to directors, and I always thought Tom Cruise wasn't too bad an actor himself
But with that said, Minority Report is an excellent piece of science fiction that works on a number of levels
For me personally, I enjoyed a lot of the film's moral and philosophical quandaries about science in general, its eventual over-dependence by society, the analogies between it and religion, the flaws and doubt of systemization (particularly in law enforcement), and finally, the gravity of our choices and how they can affect the future

Spielberg does a tremendous job weaving all of these issues into a deep enough narrative that gets you thinking, but also manages to entertain, as seen by some of the very sleek action sequences and visual effects

I also enjoyed a great deal of the screenplay and how it dispersed just the right amounts of action, adventure, drama, mystery, and thriller, never faltering and building up to a very satisfying last act


If anything, I just wish the movie were longer and a little more focused on any of the story elements mentioned above as opposed to all of them at an equally sparse level

Regardless, though, it's an excellent movie crafted by one of the best in the business and well-acted by a great group of core actors in Cruise, Farrell, von Sydow, and even Peter Stormare with his brief appearance

Minority Report is a film that, like a lot of science fiction, has more questions than answers, but with a cool and stylish kind of gritty sheen that will probably satisfy serious and popcorn audiences alike.Video - 5.0This HD master is Spielberg-approved, so who am I to argue? Minority Report is presented by Paramount in absolute pristine fashion


From the very beginning of the film to its end Janusz Kaminski's dark, yet gorgeous cinematography his preserved to perfection
Colors aren't quite as vibrant in conjunction to the film's drab art direction, but I feel they're very representative of the story's nature
Sharpness and image detail also look quite good with a great deal of dimensionality and depth between the actors, visual, and CG effects
But the biggest positives are in the black levels and contrast


Blacks are extremely deep with fine detail between lines and shadows, never losing consistency or getting lost within the photography, thanks in large part to the complimenting contrast


Skin textures, objects, and backgrounds are as good as they'll ever look outside of 3D or holograms

There's also a fine layer of grain providing for a very commendable theatrical look as well, which in some cases reveals some tiny, tiny instances of artifacting and debris, but if you're not even looking for them, it's certainly nothing to complain about
Other than that, there don't seem to be any signs of image enhancement or manipulation whatsoever.Audio - 5.0Equally matching its video is a reference-quality DTS-HD 5.1 track
I actually hadn't seen a Spielberg movie on BD until Minority Report, so I was pleasantly surprised at what I heard


The first thing that struck me was John Williams' score (another BD audio-first) and it's subtle, yet immersive presence

It does a good job setting the pace and mood for the film and gives off some excellent fidelity for heavy string and percussion instruments in particular


Dialogue is always clear and understandable from the center channel as well and never suffers from dropout or distortion

In terms of effects, the sound design stays mostly quiet, as a lot of the movie is dialogue
But being the master film-maker Spielberg is, what action and chase sequences he does use manage to really give the sound system a workout


High and low ends for all the technology usage are pitch-perfect, directionality and separation are tight and discernible from one another, and LFEs, while not too frequent, really give the room a pleasant rumble when present

My favorite bit of sound display you could probably use for showcasing would be the Car Factory chase
It represents a little bit of everything from music to sound effects placement to a very cool bass effect in the Sonic Gun he uses to take down some of his pursuers.Extras - 4.5Minority Report comes packed with a lot of the special features from the DVD release as well as some exclusive material in HD to compliment this newly minted BD release

Amounting to almost three hours worth of information, I learned quite a bit from these extras and found it fascinating just how much work went into all the production aspects
Everything from casting and writing, set and prop design, special and visual effects, sound design, music composition, and cinematography are covered to great length


In particular, I really enjoyed the Phillip K


Dick segment and a lot of the comments from cast and crew about the film's production and adaptation
Although, I am a bit disappointed that the film itself doesn't have any kind of audio or P-i-P commentary from Spielberg


But with that said, the extras still offer quite a bit of food for thought.Overall - 5.0Minority Report is another excellent entry into the science fiction genre
In the hands of Steven Spielberg, he manages to infuse a very thought-provoking premise with a fun, action-packed screenplay making for a very entertaining, yet poignant film that brings about a lot of questions in the process

While the narrative isn't quite as focused as I'd hoped for in certain aspects, the film itself is still superbly produced, finely acted, and presented extremely well on Blu-ray by the people at Paramount
With reference A/V quality, a very informative plethora of extra features, and only an SRP of $29.99 (meaning you could probably get it for at least half-ish price), Minority Report comes highly recommended.

$review_text.: Making movies of comic book storylines can be entertaining and exciting.  When there is supposed to be historical basis to the story, however incidental, some nexus and grounding in the facts is required.  Nothing of the kind exists in Django.  This is an exercise in self-indulgence and a waste of time.  Not even as a comic book can this effort find a niche that should appreciate what it offers.

$review_text.: This was a great period movie for those who like and appreciate movies about the Civil War era with historical origins.  The sheer blatant manipulation of facts, ideas and witnesses during the trial held is mind boggling; but, was what could be expected in a situation and at that time under those circumstances.  Civilians were rarely tried in military court, although it was done.  I know of another instance where a military court pushed through a similar quick military trial of civilians and had them hung for their "war crimes" as Mary Serrot was hung for hers. You feel like you learn a lot about Mary through her attorney, Mr. Aiken as he goes through the process of trying to prove her innocence.Robin Wright brings a quiet strength to the character of Mary Serrot that is wonderful to watch.  Kevin Kline as Edwin Stanton, Secretary of War is another stellar performance.  Good direction by Robert Redford, once again.  Right on target.  If you are a history buff, like Civil War history or period stories, then you will enjoy this movie.
$SUMMARY.: Great period movie!

$REVIEW.: I love Terry Pratchett. I even love most of the actors in this film but I agree with the folks who didn't think this works: it doesn't. The portrayal of Rincewind is quite good and Cohen is effortless. Everyone else is less than successful.I think it's because in order to properly play a Pratchett character, you have to be a character actor. Sean Astin, a great talent, is great for playing realistic characters. His Twoflower is dreadful. The stilted I'm-reading-lines delivery is like summerstock quality acting. From Astin, this was both a shock and a real disappointment. I didn't even care that he's not Asian like Twoflower is supposed to be: he just isn't good. Most of the cast are like this. Tim Curry plays Tim Curry, as always, so it didn't feel at all like Pratchett. Just felt like Tim Curry. A few of the side characters do very well but the material is not well-scripted. Somehow the translation got from page to script without any of the timing that makes the humor work. Lines are slowly said, huge pauses grow between the question and response...the editing and timing just sucked the film dry. Visually they did very well on a TV budget but certain elements jar: elaborate velvet robes on the wizards work but putting Rincewind in a button-down oxford shirt under it made it seem again like amateur theater. It takes you completely out of the moment.  another example is a huge overuse of one 20' wall set of the Unseen University: you see it so much, you realize they built just this tiny peice and it again takes you out of the moment. Also it's boring. Likewise a lot of fans must have been used for crowd scenes: it shows obviously.Because it's made for TV, the FX are sort of mediocre. The dragon fight hanging upside down apparently was terribly hard to film and that's too bad: it's cropped so close and cut up so much it's impossible to follow what's supposed to be happening. The action sequences are so clunky and slow that I suspect the director is at fault for much of this; there's just zero tension. Any movie involving Rincewind is mostly action as he spends his life running. Somehow, there's no speed to any of this production. It's just slow, choppy, akward.And like Hogfather, if you aren't already aware of Discworld, nothing is explained to you, which leaves half the elements feeling like in-jokes. Why did Vetinari have to have his little dog? Anyone not a fan wouldn't know the difference and any fan would know we've never seen him with the dog. It's a good example of a detail included for the fan-base that is superflous and inaccurate. It's almost insulting--if you don't know about it, you don't need it and if you do, it's wrong. Jeremy Irons' Vetinari is actually pretty good though the lisp was annoying but again, script pacing and timing of pretty much everything needed to be rethought and re-edited. It would've been 40 minutes shorter but maybe it would've been good. And good grief, get actors who can handle characters that walk the line between real and allegoric.

$REVIEW.: I really do think that while this movie is not Roman Polanski's best films, it certainly is his most beautifully made. I think he really has a keener eye these days.Johnny Depp gives his usual dark intensive performance.  If he smokes as much in real life as in this movie, he should be dead from lung cancer within five years.  There is something extremely sexy about this character.  His character is believable as one could be as a book collector/dealer, that does not mind having very little scruples.Who here would not suspect Frank Langella as an avid book collector "only wanting Depp's character to compare pictures from three volumes of the same satanic book"?I enjoyed the comparisons in the mysteries of the three books, as well as finding the "girl" intriguing.  I also admit that the deaths of three collectors of the same devilish book, to be extremely comical.  The look on the face of the strangled wheelchair bound collector brought some humor to a very dark suspensful story.I enjoyed every moment of this movie, mostly because I like movies that delve into the dark closets of the mind.  I did find that the ending left me thinking I had missed something.  So I watched it again, and nope, I didn't miss a thing.  I then created in my own mind, what I thought it all meant.Watch the movie and enjoy being totally confused.  I loved Johnny Depp and all of his steps in becoming "all knowing".

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this movie! I'm sorry so many people seemed to hate it. I've seen many (of the seemingly thousands!) of Dragonball episodes and movies over the years, and I really liked the way they created this live version. They made some small changes to the story and some characters that I'm familiar with, but I thought the changes made sense in putting together a 90-minute movie. I especially like the change they made to Chi Chi. She's now extremely cute and not at all the screeching banshee that she mostly is in the cartoon series. I thought the casting was great all around, and even though Chow Yun-fat looks nothing like Master Roshi from the cartoon, it's Chow Yun-fat for cryin' out loud! He gets to play whatever part he wants! Emmy Rossum as Bulma!? Perfect! I've forgotten the name of the actor who plays Piccollo, but again, perfect! Anyway, I'm enjoying writing this goofy review in the same way I enjoyed watching this and pretty much every Dragonball episode I've seen. Its a very simple story, lots of great action and just a fun time all around. I thought the special effects and the look of the film were great and I'm really sorry that they most likely won't be doing a series of Dragonball films. I would have loved to see Vegeta throwing down. That would have been a blast! Or Frieza! Who's up for some world-shattering combat?!!Ahem. Anyway, to get a hold of my inner child for a moment, This is just a really fun film. They did a good job of bringing the characters and feel of Dragonball to life and I really hope to see all these actors reprise their roles in many more Dragonball films. Come on! Make it happen!Oh yeah, the picture and audio on this blu-ray are excellent, the special features are slim and you get a digital copy. I say, at 15 bucks or less, buy it!

Even though nearly 100% of this film takes place in one very small studio apartment, it's never boring, never loses momentum, and never releases its suspenseful "grip" on the viewer!  And we wonder, just as Jimmy Stewart's character wonders ... Was this murder?Kudos all around on a flawless effort here!  Favorite J.

$REVIEW.: During the 1960s, American International primarily introduced low-budgeted movies geared usually for drive-ins

By some mistake, "Wild in the Streets" turned out to be both a hit and a perennial cult favorite

Deservedly so

It is probably one of the most subversive satires ever produced for the American screen
In September of 2004, it was finally released as part of a double-sided MGM Midnight Movies selection on DVD
(The flip side is one of Roger Corman's worst movies, GAS-S-S-S-S, a sophomoric comedy doubtless inspired by "Wild in the Street"'s success


 Skip it.)What is particularly strange is that "Wild in the Streets" appears to have been unreleased as soon as it was released

If you check MGM's website, you will not find it listed in MGM's inventory

Nor will you find it listed as available on Amazon or most places
In fact, the only retail place online you can find it is at BestBuy

However, it does not appear to be available at most of BestBuy's actual stores

 Did the idea of a fascistic dictatorship taking over America somehow offend the current Administration or offend executives at MGM? Just a question since I'm not privy to why it's being censored.At any rate, I would suggest that the movie's admirers buy the DVD when or where they can, since they might not have a second chance
The movie itself was released in 1968 while the Vietnam War raged on -- and on and on and on

This is important to understanding the film in its historical context


"Wild in the Streets" has several premises


The first is that the old fogies in Washington are destroying the country

Although Vietnam is not mentioned (read Iraq, if you want to bring the premise up to date), the draft certainly is on the moviemakers's minds.The second premise is that 52% of the population is aged 25 or younger, and that America as a nation idolizes youth and spends considerable time and money pursuing the fountain of youth

Young people in "Wild in the Streets" are represented by the tuned-out hippie generation, who, thanks to a charismatic leader, soon become tuned-in.A popular young rock performer, Max Frost (played by Christopher Jones, who as an actor, always seemed to be channeling James Dean, which was perfect casting for this role), decides that young people are fighting and dying for the country but do not even have the right to vote


In a satirical progression, Max first manages to get the voting age dropped to 14


Next, he succeeds in getting an ex-childhood actress-current acid-freak, Sally LeRoy (brilliantly portrayed by Diane Varsi of "Peyton Place" fame) elected to Congress


 Since Max wishes to run for President himself, he needs to get the requirement age dropped from 35, which he succeeds in doing with a little terroristic help involving the lacing with LSD of the Washington, D.C., water supply

Once Max becomes President, he manages to make 30 a mandatory retirement age and 35 an age for people to be incarcerated in concentration camps, where they can spend their remaining days forcibly tripping, thus no longer being a danger to themselves or others


Soon Max realizes that he may one day get his own comeuppance since what goes around comes around.For a low-budget movie, "Wild in the Streets" managed to acquire a top-notch cast, including Hal Holbrook as a Kennedy-like senator, Millie Perkins ("The Diary of Anne Frank") as his wife, Shelley Winters as Max's monstrous mother (her screams of "I'm young! I'm young!" as she's carted off to a concentration camp are never to be forgotten), Ed Begley as one of the old fogey politicians, and a youthful Richard Pryor as one of Max's entourage, in his first screen performance


The period rock score is equally impressive.As a major part of Max's political agenda, he intends to make the world safe -- from America: "America is now planning to withdraw from its international commitments to the relief of many, the despair of few

In addition, your armed forces are to be disbanded."Folks who don't get the satire will most likely hate this movie with a vengeance (and probably hate this review as well)


 But those who get it, will also get it with a vengeance and will contrive to buy up all the copies they can to give as gifts for like-minded friends.

$review_text.: i suppose this film will be received like an unlabeled, home-brewed IPA showing up at a nascar tailgate party; generally unappreciated, not commercially identifiable, deep in character and savory flavors but rarely refreshing thus its outcry as non-potable from the masses. i enjoyed the movie immensely, and delighted in the fact that it has an appeal that does not cater to the general viewing population yet still stands true as a beautiful, wretched, mortal expression of organized (chaos theory applicable here) crime.  believable, shameless, tragic comedy...felt the urge to take a walk and breath fresh air afterwards, a tribute to its realism, grime and grit.  as to the critiques on the dialogue and its sometimes wandering banter, have you ever just shot the s*** or had someone verbally vomit on you just because they could...it happens in real life and you quizzically bear it, and move on....the violence is flinchingly real and appetite ending, can i get an amen from the choir of folks who have really been hit in the mouth or solar plexus?....you dont just bounce back with a dribble of blood in the corner of your mouth. there is also an understanding present of the undeniable emotional toll that killing, even within the ranks of lowlife murdering scum, still must weigh heavy on the human spirit, thus the desire to kill them softly. the musical score was applicable when present while the sounds of life accompanied the rest...heavy rain smacking on paper and leather has a special note unto itself. a nod to the strangeness of the political sound bites, i can only surmise they lent peripheral narration to the unbalanced and precarious struggle of our economy at all levels and the lengths that folks will go to cover their own asses first.  5 stars was generous, but its unrepentant presentation and believable premise garnered my honest and full accolades.

$REVIEW.: I love the Mama's family sketches from the Carol Burnett show. Most may compare this to Tyler Perry's Madea-and I would agree. This dysfunctional family  were great in short spurts.After the Burnett show left the air, Producer Joe Hamilton (at that time Carol Burnett's Husband) gathered Vicki Lawrence to replace Thelma Harper (Mama). Added to cast was Ken Berry, Dorothy Lymon and Rue McClanahan. with special guest appearance by Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Betty White. One would wonder why Tim Conway wasnt asked to guest star.Now the problem, these thirteen first season episodes are finely cut as they are syndicated versions. It seem jokes are missing, lines are cut-seems like this is a rough cut of the shows..this edited piece is fun, but it could be better, especially for the price you pay.There are not extras on these DVDs-one would hope Vicki Lawrence would tell stories about the character or the show-however this is not on this collectionBennet Pomereantz AUDIOWORLD

$review_text.: Philip Seymour Hoffman stars as the (in)famous writer Truman Capote (1924-1984) in one of the best films of the year, despite the problems of viewer identification that it might provoke
In researching his "non-fiction novel" In Cold Blood Capote befriended a young man who was convicted and eventually executed for the brutal murder of a Kansas family of four


The portrait of Capote that emerges is of a flamboyant artistic genius whose deeply complex personality reveals itself in decidedly mixed motives


He attracts, repels and fascinates us, all at the same time
In the film Capote befriends the young prisoner Perry Smith for at least four conflicting reasons
Capote was egotistical, vain, narcissistic, condescending and ambitious
Several times he lied to Smith in order to exploit him for selfish, professional purposes in writing his book

When asked if he "esteemed" Smith, Capote replies, "he's a gold mine." Second, Capote's gay lover Jack jealously accused him of falling in love with Smith, which also seems to be true

Third, interviewing Smith evoked powerful memories of his own childhood that resulted in an obsessive act of self-identification and emotional attachment with him: "it's as if we grew up in the same house, but he went out the front door and I went out the back." These memories include exclusion as an outsider, family suicide, alcoholism, and parental abandonment
Finally, Capote genuinely empathized for the young death row inmate, and the film provokes themes of social justice revolving around our penal system and pity for a criminal with a horrible childhood
Smith is not a monster, he insists, and Capote intends his book to "return him to the realm of humanity." Still, Capote chose not to do all that he might have to save Smith; he even wanted Smith to die to supply an ending for his book
When the film ends we learn that In Cold Blood remained an unfinished novel, and that it was the last book that Capote ever wrote, even though he lived another eighteen years
Badly missing in this remarkable film--the slightest mention of the murdered victims and their families

Capote won five Academy Award nominations.

$review_text.: "For Your Consideration" is amiable and amusing, but is not laugh-out-loud funny.  The cast is spectacular, and includes Christopher Guest's regulars, foremost among them Jane Lynch and Fred Willard.  If you liked "Best of Show," "Waiting for Guffman" or Guest's other work, you'll find this movie at least OK.  It's amusing, but generally is not a laugh-out-loud funny comedy.As with any of Guest's films, there is far more footage shot than is actually used; it's the nature of the improv-based movie that it is assembled in the editing room afterward more than written beforehand.  So, it's not surprising that there are 30 minutes of deleted scenes.  What is surprising is what was left out of the movie.  I laughed more at the first 10 minutes of deleted scenes than I did at the rest of the movie.  A few different editing choices would have made this a much funnier movie.

$review_text.: This movie was &quot;ok&quot; but not great


 Michael Constantine steals the movie about a nerdy girl who works in a travel agency

 One day she is attracted to a man that looks in

 The man happened to be someone she waited on in her father's Greek restaurant
 She decides to pretty herself up and then starts to date the man.There is a clash of culture as his family is definately not Greek

 The Greek family is shown to be very large and fun going while the young man's family is very stiff and proper.The highlight of the movie is the constant wanderings of the girl's grandmother and her father's constant insistance that every word in the English language comes from a Greek root.I liked it but I was not overwhelmed by it like some people


 Still it is better than a lot of the new movies out there.

$review_text.: Originally premiering on the Cartoon Network as 3 minute animated shorts directed by Genny Tartakovsky (Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack), Volume 1 of Star Wars: Clone Wars is everything that George Lucas' recent prequels weren't.  Bridging the events between Episode II: Attack of the Clones and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Clone wars is full of dynamic action, and even a little bit of character development, and it has just about everything a Star Wars fanboy could hope for.  On this DVD release, you can watch every episode as one seamless feature, with all the Star Wars characters here: Obi Wan, Anakin Skywalker, Amadala, Mace Windu, Yoda, Count Dooku, and even a first glimpse as General Grievous who is to play a pivotal role in the upcoming Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.  The only real problem with Clone Wars is the animation style.  Those who are fans of Samurai Jack pretty much know what to expect animation-wise, but it can be a turn off for some.  Despite that, there is a solid voice cast, some great writing (as a previous review stated, the few second scene between Anakin and Amadala was more poignant than any scene between the two in Attack of the Clones), and the classic Star Wars action that old fans would come to expect.  Now let's all hope that Revenge of the Sith actually lives up to the hype and it's brand.

$REVIEW.: Readers, when you purchase this dvd, put on the pilot episode (entitled "Man About The House"), and fast - foward to the scene were Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers) finds Jack Tripper (John Ritter) asleep in the bathtub, drenched in water. It is not only one of the funniest moments in tv history, but the scene that shows what a genius Ritter really was.The release of "Three's Company" on dvd is a bittersweet event for the show's fan. While it's great to have this piece of television history to watch anytime you'd like, it's also sad because comes just months after John Ritter's shocking and untimely death. But as a tribute to his life and career, it's great to have.And I'm not saying that Ritter was the only actor who made the people laugh. Somers and Joyce DeWitt (Janet Wood) set up most of the gags that happened on the show, and sometimes outdid Ritter. And who can forget the late Norman Fell and Audra Lindley as Mr. Roper and his sex - hungry wife Helen. Their one -liners against each other were every bit as funny as Ritter getting smashed by a door or Somers delivering one of her stupid comments. Making an early appearance is Larry, played flawlessly by the highly underrated Richard Kline. He appears briefly in "No Children, No Dogs".As for the episodes, the pilot is an absolute classic. "No Children, No Dogs" and "It's Only Money" are excellent as well (the former features some of the best insluts between Helen and Stanley). As for the other three, they are good too, but not worth mentioning.My only gripe about this dvd is that there are no extras. No advertisements or a making - of documentary. I do not know if Anchor Bay meant to do this right from the start or they did out of respect for John Ritter. But it doesn't matter, since the complete second season is coming out on dvd in March and is supposed to be loaded with extra. Until then, this will keep you satisfid for a long time and you'll remember that three's company, too.

 It makes you want to just start swahbuckling along with the characters
I was a bit skeptical of this film at first
Movies that seem to be inspired from rides, board games or video games can seem like dodgy business, but Disney and Gore Verbinski did a great job cooking up a decent plot and adding a little supernatural element to the whole story.You have hand it to Johnny Depp
 He definitely stole the show playing the quirkiest pirate that existed on screen who still exhibited warmth, wit and charm

$REVIEW.: Despite the plot's dainty pablum (morality plus blackmail in high quarters) and somewhat farfetched setup (even if Clinton and a certain intern may have made it very credible for recent generations), the strength of Absolute Power lies in its character interactions. It is simply captivating to watch stalwarts exchange fairly taut dialogue.The denouement comes a bit hot-footed and wraps up loose ends a bit too neatly, making you think "Why didn't they just do that earlier?" and leaving you with an after-taste that the film lacked consistence or even any real depth. E.g., couldn't we have done without the subplot involving the daughter? Why not use Ed Harris a bit more? etc.Nonetheless, while watching it is riveting in its buildup of suspense, and to its credit the pace doesn't dilly-dally. Certainly a very worthy rental.

$review_text.: I watched this film at home (alone) last night at like eleven o'clock.  It was extremely scary.  It could be the fact that I was alone, or just that it really is a truly terrifying movie.  Nonetheless, the fact that a film  is scary does not exactly mean it is good movie.  The best way I could  think to describe this movie is to think of an extremely sadistic, violent  version of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;.  Granted, most of the violence  in the film is offscreen, it still makes you shiver to think of the sick,  twisted torture the killer's victims are put through.  I call him a killer,  yet he really didn't kill anyone.  One victim died of cardiac arrest  (basically being scared to death), but the others he merely tortured to no  end.  One of the most terrifying things about this film is fact that this  could really happen, and maybe even does.  Putting yourself in the position  of the victims alone is enough to give you nightmares for weeks.  I guess I  should add a little plot summary for all readers wondering:  a sick, grunk  pyscho (the guy from Twisted Sister) is luring in young teenagers over the  internet by asking if they &quot;wanna come to a party?&quot;.  Those who  make the mistake of accepting his invitation are brought into his house of  horrors and tortured...

$REVIEW.: I didn't know the story of Jeremiah very well. I've only heard of him in passing so watching this movie was an all new experience for me and I'm very glad that I watched it.Patrick Dempsey played Jeremiah and brought him to life for me on screen. He went through so much to follow what God had asked him to do, even though he was scared, even though he was timid. Dempsey brought him to life in just the manner needed.The movie is one to watch if you don't know about this story. I think it's one that needs to be told far more often. Jeremiah tried to save the people of Israel and they failed to heed his warning, but were given a glimmer of hope that is fulfilled later on.

In one review the reviewer mentioned that seeing a flashlight roll around is not scary.  Part of the spookiness about several scenes in the movie is not entirely disclosing what happens before you, but to leave something for the imagination.  Having a 5.1 surround sound system definitely helps this movie as with all movies the sound makes it.  I would highly recommend for a chilling night on the couch with your girlfriend!!!

$review_text.: This extraordinary film serves skillfully as a poetic reminder of humanities startling capacity for insufferable cruelty towards one another and amazing capacity for kindness to one another in particularly difficult situations!  Although there are several scenes throughout this film that are dreadfully difficult to watch it is a film that should be watched and the reminders it displays continued to be learned in the sincere hopes that nothing like this ever happens again in the future of humanity.It is of little wonder that this film that is based on a true story won three Academy awards; Best Actor for Adrien Brody, Best Director for Roman Polanski and Best (Adapted) Screenplay for Ronald Harwood.  Adrien Brody's unforgettable performance is nothing short of stunning as he plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist caught up in the Nazi's war against the Jewish in Poland during World War II.  This extraordinary film wouldn't have been as nearly successful without the exceptional performance given by all the supporting actors in this film as well who all deserve as much praise as possible for their parts.Strangely enough, this is the first film I've watched that was directed by Roman Polanski, which is a mistake that will be corrected.  From the beginning to the end this film is a highly gripping one and I'm sure the credit for that goes just as much to Roman Polanski's direction as it does the script and the actors performances.The Premise:"The Pianist" is the true story Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish man of Jewish faith who, with his family and millions of others, was swept up in the Nazi occupation of Poland and their quest to exterminate the Jewish people.  Szpilman, being an exceptional pianist finds himself spared from the horrible train ride to a death camp but must bare the memory of watching his entire family take that ride as he continues to do what he must to survive to make it to the end of the war...It is exceedingly difficult not to find yourself shedding a tear for the events that go on throughout this true tale of survival during the holocaust, which brings that much more poignancy to the film and its story.  I highly recommend this film to any and all!  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-A Story of Survival:  Insight into the making of the film and its authenticity-Roman Polanski's own story of survival during WWII-Behind the scenes interviews with Oscar winners Roman Polanski, Adrien Brody and Ronald Harwood-Clips of Wladyslaw Szpilman playing the piano

$review_text.: Excellent "mambo" music and colorful characters made me rate this a "five-star" after the first viewing. After several looks, the novelty - how many mambo movies are there? - wore off and it settled into a still-good "four stars" film. One thing: it's always fun to watch.Armand Assante was particularly good in here and I was intrigued with Maruschka Detmers, a new face which at times looked striking. Since she resides in France and hasn't made many, if any, English-speaking films, we here in North America haven't really seen her since this film. Assante and Antonio Bandaras are the two leads, however, sharing the spotlight with the music. Both actors are excellent, maybe the best roles of their careers.The story moves best the first 40 minutes with a lot of that "hot" music but then gets a little melodramatic afterward. However, I found it interesting all the way through with a nice tale of brotherly love and devotion.For all you "Ricky Ricardo" fans of "I Love Lucy" television: if you want a real feel of Latin Americans-in America during the 1950s, check this film out

$REVIEW.: This is a rather excellent German science fiction film. The world has become uninhabitable through ecological failure, humanity has escaped into orbit and lives in overcrowded space stations. Their only escape is the new colony on Rhea, a planet paradise. Travel to this colony is expansive so a young daughter desperate to rejoin her family signs up for an 8 year voyage hauling cargo to the colony. On her solitary shift on the ship she thinks that she's not alone and discovers that what they are transporting isn't what they thought.The film opens with a glorious shot of the space station in Earth orbit, a veritable city in space. It's a wonderful opening sequence and while the rest of the film has a more claustrophobic feel it certainly drags you in to the world it creates.It also does a good job of the voyage, the life aboard ship is lonely and stressful, but doesn't drag too long before the story gets going. From that point it builds with some effective tension, the audio design adds to the atmosphere, in fact it reminded me of Dead Space in that respect.For me there were only minor issues with the film, first and foremost was while the future tech looked good, it also lacked a practical aspect that jars slightly. Not a big issue, but hard sci-fi buffs will notice it.Overall though it is an excellent watch, one I'm happy to recommend.

$REVIEW.: Me, Myself & Irene is Peter and Bobby Farrelly's follow-up to the enormously successful There's Something About Mary. They use the same combination of physical and dialogue-driven comedy here to produce another very funny, although somewhat less remarkable movie. While Mary created a cultural phenomenon, and paved the way for so many similarly plotted comedies to follow, Me, Myself & Irene is simply one of those followers. Although the formula is still successful, it just doesn't feel as fresh and new as There's Something About Mary, and it feels just a little as if the Farrellys are struggling to come to terms with their own success. Taken in isolation however, Me, Myself & Irene is very good at doing what it sets out to do - make you laugh by depicting the most absurd and often disgusting circumstances imaginable, and then taking a comic twist.The story follows Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey), an 18-year veteran of the Rhode Island State Troopers, and a loser whose wife left him for a midget Negro Mensa member, and whose three children are decidedly dark skinned - and rather smart. Charlie doesn't deal well with conflict, and spends most of his time being used and abused by every man and his dog (literally). One day, something snaps inside of Charlie, and we meet Hank (Jim Carrey). Hank loves conflict and will do almost anything to create it. Unfortunately, despite the fact that Charlie can control Hank with drugs, the State Troopers aren't exactly thrilled to have the possibility of Hank working for them. It is at this point that Irene Waters (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) is brought in on an arrest warrant from out of state. This seems to be the perfect job for Charlie - an easy trip to take Irene to up-state New York and hand her over for her warrant. Unfortunately for Irene, her ex-boyfriend and well-to-do hood gets worried that she might know a little too much about the shady dealings he has been involved in. It is up to Charlie and Hank to ensure that Irene survives not only the ex-boyfriend and corrupt cops, but himself, long enough to prove her innocence.This movie is very funny, and closely follows the formula laid out in previous Farrelly brothers movies. The final note to make regarding this movie is on the relationship between Jim Carrey and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger who had quite a public romance following the shooting - and an equally public break up. By all accounts, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger did not allow a romantic relationship to develop while working on the movie, and this seems to have created a good on-screen chemistry between the two. Certainly comparing this movie to Proof Of Life that involved the highly public Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan relationship, Me, Myself & Irene came away without any ill effects.
$SUMMARY.: Jim Carrey does it again!

$REVIEW.: I may be the only person still watching How I Met Your Mother (what can I say, I have to know who the mother is) but despite being the lead, Ted Mosby is the least interesting of all the characters.  So it was a little hard to get too excited to hear that Josh Radnor, the actor who plays Ted wrote, directed, produced, and stared in a movie.  It also did not help it had an overly pretentious title: Happythankyoumoreplease.  My keyboard did not jam, there is actually no spaces in the name.  The title is (almost) explained in the movie, but still annoying for how it is presented.  If this were How I Met Your Mother, the other characters would be holding an intervention for Ted.The movie follows six New Yorkers, three of which are friends, as they struggle to find, or keep love.  It is filled with so many young middle class white people problems, it is hard not to think of that other sitcom actor turned writer.  Really it is anti-depressants, death, and a move of a couple miles south away from being Garden State.  Well that and the soundtrack is not nearly as cool.But the performances are solid.  As usually Radnor is the least interesting as a failing writer who inexplicably picks up a young black kid on the subway and decides to take care of him while trying to pursue Kate Mara (Urban Legend: Bloody Mary), a waitress and wannabe singer.  Malin Akerman (The Watchmen) is a woman who cannot grow hair who has terrible taste in men, and cannot tell when a good one is right in front of her, even Tony Hale (Buster Bluth!).  While Zoe Kazan (I Hate Valentine's Day) and Paolo Schreiber (Bubble Boy) are a couple at that point in their relationship where it is time to make an ultimate commitment or call it quite.  At the end of the day Happythankyoumoreplease is completely derivative but still watchable.

$REVIEW.: Admittedly, this is neither Holden's nor Hepburn's premiere work. However, there is still some good writing in this film. Clever dialogue manifesting itself best in the recurring bit about the "liar and a thief suit" garners laughs fromk me and my family every time we watch this film. Some great campiness and send-ups of movie and book genres; and Tony Curtis making fun of Marlon Brando's acting style is classic.... It's not a perfect movie, but it certainly delivers in the humor department.

$REVIEW.: For all the "rave reviews" I've read about this movie, I humbly disagree


 I usually give 2 stars to movies that had little production value and OVER-achieve or high-budget duds

 This is an over-achieving small budget film


 To those who said that it was "the scariest movie i've ever seen" or "the best movie ever made" its neither


 After reading the back cover of this release, you know the plot in 3 sentences

 Bully picks on kid

Kid plots revenge with friends

Kid gets revenge (bully dies) but feels sorry about it
 Considering the overall age of the actors in this movie, I am surprised how well they pulled it off

 (It wasn't some super sweet teeny-bopper, gum chewing ala "clueless" style of movie) Other reviewers likened it to Deliverance (apparently if a movie involves a river, a boat, people and accidental death???)  Though I saw more shades of "Lord of the Flies" (I liked the original lord of the flies black and white/british movie better than this) as the absence of parents/parenting seemed a stronger theme in the situation presented
 My largest complaint of this movie is the excessively long scenes of the landscape and the pace of the movie overall
 Too much time was spent in silence with our protoganist staring out a car window, or looking at the sides of the river as we slowly row our way to the "climax"
 Frankly, I was getting bored waiting for the movie to "get on with it"
 I was also annoyed at the ending of the movie..
no real "catharsis" to it


 We are left hanging as to what happened next

 (Mind you, I wasn't looking for the typical Hollywood ending, but that doesn't mean you have to go out of your way to not give me any ending..


sheesh
 What is that, playing the bully's video at the end.
for what? to make us 'identify with the victim'..
hoofa


2 stars, good production and good acting by the cast considering their ages, but way too long in execution.
1.5 hours felt like 2.5

$REVIEW.: I don't really get this movie.  It isn't a father/daughter film, although it is touted as one by many.  The film does have a daughter and a single father element, but they rarely share scenes and they never really create a bond worth noting.  No, this is a film about a young girl coming to terms with death and love in a strange and not so compelling way.  In fact, the film lazily concludes the film in a rush that never really gets into the heart of the premise.  It is a clich&eacute; ridden, manipulative film that has stolen the hearts of many thanks to an endearing lead performance by a young Anna Chlumsky.  She is cute and conveys her character's uniqueness rather well, but in the end it is the script that fails the film so horribly.  Yes, it is no surprise that this script failed to pass the first round of the Nicholl Fellowship screenwriting contest.  It is a hole-ridden mess really.  Yes, it makes me cry (how could it not) but it isn't a genuine heart-tug.  It never really addresses Vada's issues with any true resolve.  It had the opportunity to become something more but it was too concerned with being `light family fun' that the more intriguing aspects of the film (like the fascination and misunderstanding of death) become underdeveloped side notes.  Oh well, Chlumsky is wonderful and Culkin is also rather good.  Aykroyd and Curtis are just mere props here, doing nothing much but serving as adult stand-ins.  And, to clear up a grave (and rather foolish) mistake, Curtis does not play Culkin's single mother.  How the sites reviewer got that from this film is beyond me.  Anyways; the movie is pretty awful, but I seem to be the only person to feel that way.

$REVIEW.: this is a lavish, wonderful production, with a cast that is so comfortable with the language

They bring out the beauty of the words, and clarity to their meaning.Norma Shearer, despite being more than twice Juliet's age, plays her exquisitely...I find her to be the loveliest and most graceful of the screen Juliets I've seen.Leslie Howard, who was 42 at the time, is splendid

With his perfect musical voice and enunciation, he's a joy to watch and listen to...what a pity that he didn't film more Shakespeare...a Howard "Hamlet" (which he had a huge success with on Broadway), would have certainly been a film treasure.Also great is John Barrymore's flamboyant Mercutio, and Edna May Oliver is my all-time favorite Nurse.Though I think the imaginitive and slightly bizarre Baz Luhmann/Leonardo DiCaprio version is fabulous and a must-see (as is the fight scene in the Zeffirelli production !) what makes this George Cukor version so special is the poetry of the language...if you want to hear the words spoken as I'm sure Shakespeare intended, give this film a try.

It is sad that Joseph Kearns, the man that played Mr. Wilson, died suddenly during this season.  I highly recommend seasons one through three.  I will get season four when it comes out, but am not sure if it will be as good as the first three seasons without Joseph Kearns and as Jay North gets older.

$REVIEW.: "Miller's Crossing" Is best described as that "stylish Coen Bros. Gangster Movie".  Instead of the southwestern types populating "Raising Arizona" and "Blood Simple", we have the "Dapper Dans" and fast-talking molls of some nameless Prohibition-era metropolis.  Seething with an endless array of illicit dealing (speakeasies, bookmaking, fight-fixing), the city is barely held together by boss Lee O'Bannon (Albert Finney).  Even the Police Chief and the Mayor pay unquestioned deference to O'Bannon who, when times get desperate, proves he's still an artist with a Tommygun.  Nobody gets big without O'Bannon's permission, but the crime boss has a weakness - Verna Birnbaum (Marcia Gay Harden).Lee's obsession with Verna proves fatal because he feels obligated to protect her no-good brother Bernie, an utter creep marked for death by lower crime boss Johnny Caspar.  Gabriel Byrne is Tommy Regan, Lee's right-hand man and also his conscience.  Regan cautions his boss to dump Verna - he knows that both she and her brother aren't worth going to war over.  But he's also fallen for Verna.  When O'Bannon ignores Tom, he sparks a mob war that soon threatens his primacy and catapults Caspar to the ultimate power.  Tom must navigate an uncertain path as Caspar's new confidante, one that brings him to blows with Caspar's right-hand man, and will see him realize his true feelings for Verna.This was a great movie, with an uncommon sense of sound and visual artistry.  Putting aside the plot, full of characters with shifting motives, the Coens display their great ear for unforgettable dialog and expression.  Their never-named city manages to be more cartoonishly realized than those that appeared in the many Batman-clones that appeared in the early 1990's when "Crossing" was released.  The Coen's rely on their gift for visual irony - their city is populated with Cops who strut proudly even though conscious that they are tools of the bosses.  (In my favorite scene, Tom takes a chair to an oversized enforcer sent to rough him up; his "victim's" expression - like a child on the verge of tears - is priceless.)At its heart, "Crossing" is an impossible mix of contradictions - with action both fast and slow, rough and smooth, heavy and light, best shown in a scene where Finney single-handedly turns the tables on would-be assassins, and the rat-a-tat of his submachine gun shares our attentions with the poignant sounds of "O Danny Boy".  Not quite the collection of sight-gags familiar in stock Coen fare like "Intolerable Cruelty" or "O' Brother", the film is best compared to a dream that Gabriel Byrne's character describes to Verna, of chasing his hat through the wind.  Byrne calls the sight of a grown man chasing something pathetic, but Verna thinks that hat an image that will change into something beautiful.  Even if you don't buy the story, the film's mix of imagery will prove unforgettable.

$REVIEW.: The cinematography was stunning.  The movie was so visually beautiful that I couldn't look away, so I did read all the subtitles!  Even across the language barrier, I felt by the end that I had known those chaacters for years, and known that village.  Some may say that there was little plot and that nothing happened. But the plot lay in the family tensions between generations, right down to questions of who would survive nomal life, and how.  Most of our life's dramas are played out on the small stages of families, villages, and in the character-forging drama of small, nearly-silent personal apocalypses.  The writing was spare and tight, almost Cormac McCarythesque.  Author Michael Lindvall once said that true heroism was in loving the same people for a long time.  This is a film about that capacity.

I really didn't like this movie because of all the big time evilness and corruption all for the sake of it
It's so terrible to see how a cop could be so corrupt and wayward, as well as the hierarchy rule in the police department and agencies, that I had to wonder if such a level of immorality could really exist


You then look at the world around you and know that this is exactly what goes on all the time

$REVIEW.: This set contains parts 1 & 2 in slimcase design, a feature I like because they're space savers.I remember going to see the first "Ghostbusters" & flipping for it (I went to the theatre FOUR times!)


This "special effects" comedy was really something else, and it still holds up pretty well today (who can forget one of the great movie sight gags involving a giant Staypuft Marshmallow Man??)
 It had a funny & loose script, terrific special FX, a great cast (even Sigourney Weaver showed she had a flair for comedy) and a good director at the helm (Ivan Reitman, who previously worked with Murray & Ramis on "Stripes")
All you have to do is watch it again to figure out why GB became the biggest grossing comedy of all time (that is, until "Home Alone" ousted it from its throne).GB2 came close but failed to top the original


Picking up five years later, weird supernatural occurrences (which seem to involve Dana Barrett's baby) prompt her to seek out the guys (who are now poor after New York City sued the GBs for damages from their previous film) for help


After narrowly escaping a "hangman's trial" by a ruthless judge by battling some pesky spirits (whom the judge had given the chair earlier), the boys are back in business

There are some good comedy scenes here, such as the "river of slime", the Titanic finally "arriving", and the "calvary" in the form of a slime-powered Statue of Liberty


Winston's (Ernie Hudson) role is expanded in this one, and look out for the actor who nearly steals the picture as the nerdy foreigner whose services are used by the creepy villain Viggo.The remasters are nicely done, and the booklet of information behind the making of the GB duo is a fun read

A "making of" featurette on the original is among the DVD extras, along with two episodes from the animated series.

$REVIEW.: The Matrix is a stunning sci-fi thriller from the remarkable Wachowski brothers, who CO-wrote and CO-directed it. With just a couple of small independent films under their belts, the Wachowskis were somehow able to propel themselves into the front line of big budget film making. So skittish was the management team at Warner Brothers over the project that it opted to take on an Australian finical partner. Making The Matrix in Australia further lowered Warner's risk. Now that the film is a worldwide smash hit, the company must split the profits and the credit. Welcome to the New Hollywood, a place run by business types who make decisions based not on gut instinct, but on a wealth of computer data. Ironically, The Matrix is about the fate of a world that carries its reliance on computers too far.The movie opens in the year 1999. Or is it 1999 at all? We find Tom Anderson living two lives. By day he is an employee at a powerful software company. By night he is a computer hacker known as Neo. Without giving the plot away, I can say that all his life, Anderson has felt that the world is somehow vaguely askew. In his secret life on the Internet, he has become obsessed with a man know only as Morpheus, who is wanted by the authorities for computer sabotage. One night he is lead to a disco where he meets a strange and beautiful girl called Trinity. She is also a hacker and can arrange for him to meet Morpheus. The plot then gets very thick indeed.In another irony, I have never seen a film that integrates computer graphics and effects into the story as well as The Matrix does. The subject matter demands a heavy reliance on special effects. In fact, prior to the introduction of digital technology, such a movie would have been extremely difficult to make. Its theme and tone are much like another sci-fi classic, Blade Runner, but that earlier movie did not have to bend the rules of space and time in the ways The Matrix does.Despite all it technical wizardry, The Matrix's driving force is its riveting thriller of a story. Glorious special effects, for once, enhance the memorable characters. The theme may owe its origins to the best of the comic books, but this does not detract from it, any more than it did from the first Superman and Batman movies.Keanu Reeves is excellent as Neo. It's not the kind of performance that wins an Oscar. It's the kind one remembers long after one forgets who won the Oscar. Like the late Cary Grant, Reeves is more star and personality than actor. Grant played Grant better than anyone else, and only Reeves can play Reeves. Laurence Fishburne gives his usual strong yet thoughtful performance in the role of Morpheus. Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity with both relish and style.The Matrix is a big, splashy show, and it is less spectacular on video than it was on the big screen. Still, most of the big events play reasonable well when shrunk down, and the story itself is perhaps a bit enhanced on video.Both a thrill ride and a thought provoking look at mankind's tenuous relationship with reality, The Matrix is unlike any movie you are likely to see this year. In fact, I haven't admired a high profile sci-fi thriller this much since Alien, Aliens and Blade Runner in the early 1980s.

$REVIEW.: Johnny Depp plays Paul Kemp, a New Yorker hired to work at a newspaper in San Juan (1960)

The paper is going down hill


The editor, Richard Jenkins, wants new blood, even though Paul appears to be everything he doesn't want in an employee


There is unrest outside, but no one at the newspaper knows what is going on

The humor is fast and witty
The man Paul is replacing was "artistic" and "raped to death" by sailors.Paul Kemp is a Hunter S.Thompson clone
He was hired because the editor likes his style of writing

He is placed in charge of writing horoscopes, something he makes up


He describes the obese Yankee tourists as "great whites" the most deadly creature known to man
They are afraid to venture outside of their hotel, spending their days bowling, gambling, and duty free shopping

The more you spend, the more you save


His writings tend to be cynical.Aaron Eckhart is a wealthy mobster/businessman, Amber Heard is his free spirited gf who causes everyone grief


Aaron needs a writer (PR man) with new eyes, and Paul sets his bloodshot eyes on Amber, a woman who considers clothes optional
There is also criticism of today's conservatives as Paul remarks about Nixon, "Some day some filthy hoar-beast will make him look like a liberal."  While watching the Nixon-Kennedy debate, through a pair of binoculars on a neighbors TV, Paul is able to predict a Kennedy victory because "I do horoscopes." The humor is off-beat, cynical, and hard hitting like Thompson

A local proclaims, "This country was founded on genocide and slavery...then they brought in Jesus like a bar of soap."The movie is also critical of the dummy-down media who kills stories so as to not offend their advertisers
In the film, capitalism is destroying Puerto Rico, creating a war of haves vs
have-nots while Cuba turns to communism


A rich man claims, "Liberals are college educated communists with Negro thoughts." To them the problem with the world is the communists


The movie takes a leftist look at the world as it plays out in the microcosm of Puerto Rico.Paul is caught between the two worlds and must make a choice.The movie is not all political

Just as you think Paul has reached bottom, he discovers "a drug so powerful that the FBI gives it to communists." NOTE: LSD in liquid form, administered to the eye should be done in split drops with three full drops being way too much, possibly causing hallucinations...or so I've been told.Good acting, good script, funny and very entertaining


Staunch conservatives might be critical of the leftist views contained in this Hollywood film


A must view for Hunter S


Thompson fans.F-bomb, excessive drinking, drug use
Was that Amber topless is a dimly lit love scene?

Sure, there's some cheap jokes, but this movie is based on character development (and EVERY character is great), and the quirks of each character makes the lines even funnier than they should be (sweet stache bro; Everyone was there, the gang, Cousin Ira)If you like movies like Royal Tenenbaums, Rushmore, Bottle Rocket, SuperTroopers you will like this
If anything, it's easily on par with the first two.

$review_text.: I was a little skeptical to watch this reboot of Judge Dredd, simply because I truly enjoyed the first movie, and didn't think the reboot would do it justice (no pun intended.)First, let me say, I am a Karl Urban fan

 I have pretty much enjoyed every character he's played, starting with that of Julius Caesar in the Xena TV series


 However, I wasn't sure he would be the hard-edge, muscle bound character like Sylvester Stallone's Dredd

 And he wasn't, muscle bound that is, however, he gave the character a harder edge, in my opinion than Sly did.The only drawback to this movie in my opinion, was the lack of character development, pretty much no back story, just straight to the action
 This wasn't a deal breaker for me as I did truly enjoy this movie.I would definitely be in line to see a Dredd 2 if it was released.

$review_text.: With Steven Spielberg providing us the story,and being Executive Producer, with Richard Donner as the Director (Lethal Weapon series)we get the greatest adventure and cast of unforgettable characters (Chunk, Sloth and Mouth to mention a few). This DVD provides us the way to this great &quot;Pirate Treasure Adventure&quot;!!!! In Summary: Taking place in the town of &quot;Astoria&quot; on the rugged coast of Oregon. A group of misfit kids &quot;nicknamed the &quot;Goonies&quot; by others in town. Find themselves in a difficult situation. There neighborhood is being foreclosed in 24 hours by the rich country club snobs for a golf course. (By the way, Astoria has a rich history of Pirates and lost treasure). The Goonies find a treasure map and decide to find the loot to save their homes. The race for &quot;One Eyed Willy's&quot; treasure begins and this wonderful cast of characters who are also pursued by a colorful group villians. The DVD extras include: The making of. Outtakes of scenes cut, including the giant octopus sequence. The commentary track includes audio and video of the original Goonies and the Director on a 16 year reunion reflection of their personal experiences making the movie as kids. This is a great family movie and the story line, adventure theme of &quot;Pirates Treasure&quot; is perfect! Once you see the &quot;Goonies&quot; in action, you'll always be a Goonie!!! Trust me this one is fun.

$review_text.: When Colin Farrell is in a movie I am never disappointed and here again I was thrilled to see him looking the part and bringing his body of work as an actor to do the best he could to remake a movie that has just been tarnished by the original star. But Farrell pulls it out and puts emotion, physique and believability to his character who we root and care for. Unlike the original drone-like actor who really depended on the set to move the movie Farrell plows through the set and pulls an otherwise sinkable script off the ground and gets us to care and believe in the world we see.Other movies where Colin Farrell brings great characters to live and have great scripts areIn BrugesandA Home at the End of the Worldbut each role he plays I applaud this once innocent young actor who has taken control of his craft and given us some great films to enjoy again and again.

I am glad they released this on DVD, and I watch at least an episode or two of Saved by the Bell before I go to bed. I think there should have been extra features on this, such as 'Where Are They Now?'. We all know what Mario, Tiffani, Screech, and Mark-Paul are doing now but what about the drama chick, Leslie and Rogers? I'm sure there are websites about them somewhere but I think since this was aired in primetime NBC should have put some TV promotions or at least something to spice this up. Otherwise you'll enjoy the incomplete college story of the former Bayside guys and Kelly.

$review_text.: THE NEW THREE STOOGES-COMPLETE CARTOON COLLECTION: Endlessly released, reissued and regurgitated during the DVD age, this animated version of every red blooded male's favorite numbskulls obviously can't compare to the original Colombia shorts with CURLY and SHEMP...or for that matter, not even the final full length flicks made with CURLY JOE DERITA. Although each five minute cartoon boasts MOE, LARRY and CURLY JOE's original voices (as opposed to the lame brained characterizations of the later ROBONIC STOOGES) and color live action wraparound segments, the storylines and animation are pretty pedestrian. The questionable quality of these prints goes with the territory of all public domain material, but at least this massive set includes all 156 toons in the series (although only 40 live intros were filmed) and a bonus cd of THE THREE STOOGES NONSENSE SONGBOOK and some cracked Christmas carols.

$review_text.: Ah, the experiences of childhood and the memories we procure from them. Looking back, we can see how they mold and shape us, crafting something from those moments that oftentimes plague our fragile little minds. In the case of our young focal point, for instance, there are the joys of baseball and watching your father coach little league, throwing out pitch after pitch while crafting in you a love for the sport that will never leave you. There are also the heroic moments afterward, like your father rushing in and saving a poor Haitian girl from the press of two thugs and their sexual exploits. And there are also those with darker tenses, like the hero finding himself shattered, folded into a ball with a knife wound ending his life. Still, these experiences sometimes make us indignant to the vile, keeping us on a path of the tried and true. Unfortunately, when that life is cut short as well, revenge and a debt from the past can be used as a calling card for those that are left to pick up the pieces, and the images in the mind can sometimes be used to recall the transgressions leading to our passing.Within Zombie Nightmare, there are some portions that are unintentionally funny, some that are stomachable, and some that are downright terrible. This makes a mesh of ideas and loosely contrived notions that are, in two words, tiring and worn-out. The plot, with its voodoo roots, is nothing groundbreaking and creates many a loophole within its questionable delivery system, leaving the viewer sometimes holding the always burdensome question "why." The camera play leaves much to be desired as well, accenting the fact that the storyline isn't the best by mesmerizing its audience with a collage of blurs and ocular metaphors that seem to puzzle even the most trained of eyes. Also added to this is the fact that the actors, aside from one of the supposed "bad guys," are extremely terrible and its hard to find a side to root for. Dice a little cheapness into your zombie creation, mixing the fact that it is undead with its need to cradle a bat and same things, and you have an equation of the unwatchable sort.

$REVIEW.: Just watched my copy of this and have a few thoughts for anyone considering purchasing this dvd.1. This is the "holy grail" of the commercially released visuals of Bauhaus back in the 80's on 2 vhs tapes. Since then, after going out of print long ago, they have been a mainstay on Ebay, etc. in copied versions for a good reason - this was a visual band and these tapes caught them at their zenith. An absolute must-have for fans and those curious about what the fuss is all about.2. For the fans, like myself, who have owned the original vhs tapes since whenever, don't expect a major upgrade in visual quality. This stuff was originally shot on videotape and it shows. This is the best it will ever look, which is great, but not a LOT better than the original tapes. The sound is excellent, however - I noticed no tape hiss and distortion, and there are a few audio options on the menu page.The band had nothing to do with this dvd release, so gripes about the artwork, etc. are redundant - Beggar's Banquet has sole rights to this footage and tried to get extras, like UK TV spots, etc. but were foiled by the owners of the rare footage. Bauhaus do not benefit financially from this dvd whatsoever, which is sad.Bauhaus were a truly original and fascinating band, and this dvd captures them at their absolute best. A true classic rock/performance dvd. Highly recommended.

The storyline is inventive and well planned...executed to perfection!I am a tough critic....loved this movie....will watch it over and over and each time I am sure I will get more out of it!

Maybe that's why so many actors and actresses that are normally great deliver such poor performances in this over acted, under directed, piece of formula writing. Though I am a fan of `bad' b horror movies, even my love of them couldn't help me tolerate this film.I thought about how to write this review without giving any spoilers, well, watch five minutes of the film, then think about the next formula, pat, unexciting thing that could happen, and boom, you're there, it just happened. There are no twists and turns in the plot, it's calm as a still pond and smooth as glass, so it had the general effect of luring you to sleep.Even the special effects are nothing new or exciting. Matter as fact, they're pretty amature, looking like they were created in Maya by a couple of college students that are getting poor grades in art class.If you're thinking about watching this, or worse yet, buying it. Don't. Howling is a werewolf movie classic and well worth your time. But if you invest yourself in Cursed, you'll just come out feeling cheated.Not recommended.

When I first heard about this movie I was a little leary about it due to some of the reviews I had read and the fact that it didn't earn a theatrical release here in the states. But I must say that I was very pleasently surprised when I popped into my dvd player yesterday afternoon.With this film, Jackie proves once again, that he is the man of action films. No one does it better. Period. The stunts in this film are amazing as usual and Jackie still looks in top form even though he's pushing 50. The fight scenes are creative and use Jackie's usual style of incorporating many different objects and people into the scenes. The best scene in the movie is a 10 minute fight fest that lands Jackie naked on the streets of Turkey. Very creative!The plot of the movie is pretty decent for a JC film. Basically, Jackie gets mixed up in a drug war between the Koreans and the Turkish. I watched the english dubbed version so I'm sure the plot lost a little bit in the translation. But the plot is not the main reason we watch these type of films right? The action is great and definately worth the price of the dvd alone.The dvd is ok. The picture and audio are acceptable but the extras and menus are not.

$review_text.: The fifth instalment of the Harry Potter series is not an easy read


It deals with death and loneliness and the "age of nobody understands me"
Despite facing death for the first time in the fourth book, this is the first time Harry is facing the aftermath of death and learning how to deal with death itself

The theme was clear right from the beginning when he saw the "winged creatures with bones on their bodies" drawing the carriage and nobody except Luna, who had seen death, could see it.David Yates managed to capture all these very well in his vision of the Harry Potter world
It is dark all through and the loneliness of the boy wizard that creeps in from time to time does show that the audience should now be ready for something more epical and drastic coming

Book five is a bridging book of the series and it is not easy to please anyone

So is the film

Critics have not been easy on the movie itself but a more closely look to the book, and then you will be able to appreciate more about the movie
There were lots of details from the book that were left out because of the natural confinement of the movie medium itself, but it does keep a lot of the originalities inside

The rendenz-vous with Luna is more memorable as compared to the book, but the whole nerdiness of the character was gone

Luna became a creepy, calm but very interesting character and Evanna Lynch did a fair job, considering the substantial change to the character in the script


The importance of the Order itself was shifted in the movie


As a result they became side line story instead and all the relationships among the people in the Order became unimportant in the movie

So if you are up for the Order you might be disappointed


However, it seems like the new Order is formed under the Dumbledore Army is being the new theme of the movie


The passing of the baton became very important as compared to the book

The more mentioned character in the Order is undoubtedly Sirius Black but that is understandable, considering his pivotal role in the book itself
However, the way he showed up in the flame this time is different as compared to Goblet of Fire


That might be the sort of details producers need to look at - how can the same magic performed by the same person in the same space look completely different between the two movies?Daniel, Rupert and Emma gave a fair performance but really in this movie they didn't really shine

Daniel looks angry all the time

Yes, the character is supposed to be angry but not superficially with an angry face and just panting heavily with a few water drops on his face


If his performance as an actor in Equus receives critical acclaim, sure he should be able to deliver more in Half Blood Prince


But again, is Harry a demanding character to perform? The screen stealer is no doubt Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge
Her appearances showed a well interpretation of aggressive gentleness - and she is not shy to deploy that on her students


Emma Thompson brief appearances were still very enjoyable although in the book her character is more important than in the movie


But again, the movie is now more about the younger generation.The special effects are up to standard as usual but a lot of familiar things are back, e.g


the moving staircases and of course the centaurs

The battle at the Ministry is a well orchestrated end to the movie and the swift movements between the Death Eaters and the Order certainly are cool eye candies for the movie
The youngster also played out well as the successors of the Order for the future

The battle between the opposites - light and darkness, fire versus water, were well done, though a bit obvious
The score of the movie is spectacular and captures the emotion of the movie extremely well

That added a lot of substance to the movie itself
For the well, kissing scene, it is just really overrated


Maybe it is an impact for kids, but for adults, it is just another kissing scene.Squeezing the book into a 2 hours or so movie is not an easy task

David Yates sure did a good job for the book
The book itself was not an easy read, so the movie will not be an easy watch for a lot of people, especially if you are expecting a standard Harry formula of just imaginary fantasy, because the fantasy is over

What is in stall for the audience this time is some serious action that will cause the lives of a number of characters in the upcoming finale

The Potter movie has grown out of the kids premises and like all teenagers' coming of age, it is not easy to handle and appreciate.

The main male character did have a pretty closed emotional outlook and the girl was not really distinctive. But this flick is full of side characters that were entertaining and, of course, event though he has a bit part, John Heder is always, always, always entertaining.

$REVIEW.: A woman and her two daughters try to cope after her husband goes off to war in 1944's SINCE YOU WENT AWAY, a four-hankie weepie made during World War II.  Boasting an all-star cast, Gone With the Wind's producer David O. Selznick, and epic length (nearly 3-hours, with intermission), this movie should be a revered classic.  However, like Gone With the Wind, it hasn't aged all that well.You can't, for the most part, fault the cast.  The redoubtable Claudette Colbert could play `ideal woman' with the best of them, and here her ability to portray quiet yearning for her departed husband is one of the movie's biggest assets.  The `ideal' theme is punctuated by Joseph Cotten, here an artist turned navy commander who loves old flame Anne Hilton from a flirtatious yet unbridgeable distance.  Agnes Moorehead as the somewhat shrill `bad' statesider is also effective.  Love to see those that sneer at rationing get their comeuppance, even if I have to wait nearly three hours for it. The revelation, though, is Robert Walker as the "Golly gee" youth who finds love with one of Colbert's daughters, played by Walker's then real-life wife Jennifer Jones, shortly before his unit is due to ship out.  The only other movie I've seen Walker in was Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, in which he plays probably the best film psychopath ever.  His role in this movie is as far away from Bruno Anthony as can be imagined, and it's terribly affecting.Monty Woolley, who made something of a career out of playing curmudgeons coming to dinner and nesting in a spare room, here plays a curmudgeonly retired colonel who rents a room from cash-strapped Colbert.  That he's the estranged grandfather of sweet young Robert Walker is a happy coincidence.  Shirley Temple, Colbert's other daughter, made something of a career out of charming old curmudgeons and crying on cue, both of which traits are severely tested by this movie.  It was effective when she was six, but at sixteen I found it, well, annoying.  In fact, both the Woolley and the Temple characters seemed a little convenient, a little phony.  Temple because she couldn't act, Woolley because he was too much Sheridan Whiteside from The Man Who Came to Dinner.  If they merely annoyed, Hattie McDaniel's `Fidelia' shocked and offended.  Fidelia was the Hilton's maid until Tim Hilton enlistment, at which point she was let go because the family could no longer afford her.  The movie has her returning to the Hiltons, as their maid, for no money because... well, because she loves the family so much and she can't stand to see them try to survive without her.  So, after her day job she will come `home' and play maid for the Hiltons.Look, I realize SINCE YOU WENT AWAY is supposed to be a sentimental celebration of the loved ones on the home front.  Much of it is moving and touching, especially the parts played by Cotten and Walker.  The rest seem conceits embraced by the greatest generation but dropped by their heirs.

$REVIEW.: A documentary which only tells one side of the story is clearly meant to promote the film-makers bias

I watched this movie carefully, waiting to hear from trainers who would give &#34;their side&#8221; of the story&#8230; not gonna happen


We simply get the inconsistent and shallow comments of disgruntled employees

&#8220;I was young and didn&#8217;t know what I was doing&#8221;
&#8220;I believed whatever Sea World told me&#8230; how was I to know?&#8221; Then we hear the &#8220;scientific input&#8221;: Tilacom was kept in a small metal box which clearly would lead any animal to become aggressive
(I agree)&#8230; HOWEVER, later in the &#8220;documentary&#8221;, he is used for breeding, and this statement is made &#34;How could Sea World breed an Orca who is genetically aggressive&#8221;

HUHHH?? Are you kidding me? What a bunch of rot! As proof of his &#8220;danger&#8221;, someone snuck into the park and was killed by Tilacom during the night
This docu-dummary goes on to say &#34;How could they keep such a dangerous animal in the park?&#8221; Huhhhh&#8230; Are you kidding me?? A meathead sneaks in and goes for a swim with a killer whale, and this is Sea World&#8217;s fault?? We are told by an &#34;expert&#34; that Tilacom &#34;stripped the man naked and ate his genitals&#34;

I'm sure there is NO possibility that he stripped down by himself

Even the best trainers are NEVER to be in contact without a spotter nearby

We are further lead to believe that the trainers aren&#8217;t told of the risks involved and that the Orca Show should never happen because people can and do get killed
Huhhh&#8230; Are you kidding me??? Well then, let&#8217;s outlaw any activity where someone may be killed


Does anyone really believe the trainers don&#8217;t know of the risk? This movie has some very good points, especially the first 35-40 minutes.We see true atrocities in the capture of baby Orcas and the small poor facilities at &#8220;Sea Land&#8221;- clearly abusive
It then becomes a pure mess of a presentation- it is highly manipulative&#8230; It is a great film to study the effective use of partial truth in propaganda
Here's the formula- 1.Begin with unbiased INFORMATION and comments that are reasonable and informative 2


Gradually, throw in OPINIONS from the aforementioned &#34;reasonable&#34; witnesses


3

Finally, cue the dark musical score, and present misinformation and bias based upon one-sided reports


Whatever you do, don't present any facts or testimonies from those who disagree with your propaganda


...Believe it or not, I am conflicted over the Sea World Orca shows
I'm not a &#34;Catch Willy and Make Him Do Ticks&#34; fan; however, I want to hear the whole unbiased story


 There are plenty of former trainers who would have presented the alternate view- I want a balanced debate- you certainly won&#8217;t get it here.


$review_summary.: Great for studying the art of biased propaganda.

$REVIEW.: FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE while being the second in the series to DR

NO is the first in which the James Bond popular culture came to know and love makes his appearance and is often considered the best of them all
Sean Connery plays Bond a bit different from the character on the pages of Ian Fleming spy novels as well as turning in an improved performance over his previous effort in DR

NO

Connery made a Bond better fit for the screen, giving the character more personality, more charisma and humor than Fleming's buttoned-up, bland English gentleman spy


As one co-producer of the Bond films says,"We always start out trying to make another FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and end up with another THUNDERBALL"


Well, THUNDERBALL is just another good Sean Connery Bond action film while FROM RUSSIA.

$REVIEW.: Here's an "epic" movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid 1960s such as Dr
Zhivago and Lawrence Of Arabia
Interesting to note that Omar Sharif was in this modern-day movie and Dr


Zhivago

Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because, thanks to the previews, they thought it would be an action-packed adventure story such as "The Mummy." Well, it wasn't and it was way too slow for them.Frankly, I thought the "slow" parts were the best and overall, thought the film had just the right amount of action, instead of overdoing it as the recent Mummy pictures did
Another big plus was the cinematography


This is a beautifully filmed movie, stunning in some parts
Another good point is the language: hardly a swear word.On the negative side, there was the usual political correctness, a la Dances With Wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at Wounded Knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys
The horse race had some credibility problems, too, as "Hidalgo" came back from the dead not once but twice to race like Secretariat!Anyway, if you are looking for a modern-day adventure story with old-fashioned storytelling and no language problems, this film is for you and the rest of the family.

$REVIEW.: George Lopez, came along way until I Love Lucy hit the air. Before it was George Lopez, there was I Love Lucy.  Where Desi Arnaz broke barriers of Latino Entertainment.  There were a few latins nobody ever heard of T.V., Lynda Carter who played Wonder Woman she was half latin and half white, Mario Lopez who plays A.C. Slater in Saved By The Bell was a Latino-American, Alexis Bledel who played Rory Gilmore in the Gilmore was a latino chick she's part Argentinian and Mexican and Charisma Carpenter who played Cordelia Chase is part white and Mexican.  I never have to worry ethnic backgrounds for a while.  Constance Marie who plays George's Wife Angie, she's looks and acts more like George's Daughter than his wife.  I always thought Angie was his daughter, not his wife.  Constance Marie doesn't look or act latin, she looks like a white girl than a latin chick.  Constance Marie has the greatest resemblance of Penelope Cruz and Gilmore Girls Lauren Graham. Masiela Lusha who plays Carmen, she has the greatest resemblance of Alexis Bledel from the Gilmore Girls and Katie Holmes.  It must not be easy being George Lopez.

There is also tons of great learning for adults as well it has a happy medium.  It's not too in depth but it is a really fun program to watch.  I am also surprised that the global warming card wasn't played stronger in the last episode it goes into the warming and changing environment but i didn't feel it was overboard in pushing an agenda.  Great fun and enjoyable to watch over a few weeks of time.+ great footage+ great narrating by David Attenborough+ interesting story-line, kids can follow as well as adults- some footage was recycled in separate episodes- they often return to the same subjects instead of finding new and different things...ie polar bears, killer whales, grey wolvesMy favorite footage has to be from the underwater ice and the caving on Mt Erebus, overall 4 for 5 for making entertainment meet learning.

$REVIEW.: I was a perfect candidate for purchasing this film.  Why?I own a copy of the CD and of the book that share the story with this film.  And I find it compelling, interesting, and fun to watch.  Anything with Lauren Ambrose is fun, and she shines as a normal, frustrated girlfriend opposite the awkward Mike Birbiglia.This film focuses a bit more on the growth of Mike Birbiglia as a comedian (er, sorry, Matt Pandamiglio) compared to the book and standup specials (part of the necessity of the story is understanding the narrator's voice), but the cameos by other comedians you'd probably remember from somewhere (though possibly find it hard to know exactly where) should make you smile.Overall, I love this film.

$REVIEW.: I read several different reviews of this movie before I decided to buy it


 I read several people describing it as "different", "unique" and "brilliant"
 I guess that's one way of looking at it...another would be "strange, yet boring"


 Deadgirl has it moments where it's entertaining but for the most part I found myself waiting for the movie to hit it's stride

 I found the story to be unbelievable...granted, it's basically a zombie movie, it's still rediculous, even by zombie movie standards

 During the movie I found myself wondering if the director was aiming for horror or comedy because there is plenty of both throughout the entire thing


 Bottom line here is that this movie is definately not an earth-shattering, genius movie


 I wish I would have rented it before I bought it because I probably wouldn't have purchased it had I watched it beforehand
 If anything this is a movie you can bust out just to show your friends that you have it because they probably have never heard of it before


 I don't really see myself ever watching it again unless it's just to show someone else and even then I'll probably be too bored to go through the whole thing again

 It is what it is I guess...if you want a cool-looking, obscure movie to add to your collection then here it is...if you want a film masterpiece then head somewhere else


 That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.

$REVIEW.: Some directors just 'get it.' They have a cool, easy sensibility and make their work look almost effortless. Robert Rodriguez is one of those directors. Like most directors he's not 100% but when he's good he's great. This made for Showtime piece is a ton of fun.Here's the scoop. It's 1956 and the U.S. is in the midst of the Eisenhower era with its near nondescript character. Rock and Roll is starting to happen, particularly in Texas where the film is set. Buddy Holly, Bill Haley and Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys are starting to shake things up. Dude Delaney (David Arquette) plays a mean guitar but is not in a band. He has a gorgeous Mexican girlfriend (Salma Hayek) whom he cannot commit to though he loves her dearly. The local sheriff (William Sadler) wants to run him out of town as he did Dude's father. He's using his son to do so. How will all this shake out?This is just a cool flick. It has a great Rock-a-Billy soundtrack with souped-up cars, roller rinks, greased-up hair and leather jackets. The bad guys are racist and stupid. Arquette doesn't cow-tow to the man. His close buddy (John Hawkes) is enthralled with the movie "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" which has just released to the theaters. It has a lot of great elements. Arquette has an epiphanal moment near the end where he sees the world like Kevin McCarthy sees it in the final scene of "Invaders of the Body Snatchers" where everyone is in danger of becoming soul-less creatures. He cannot let that happen to him so he needs to strike back.The acting and overall production values are good. I had some reservations about Arquette in the lead but I warmed up to him by the end. Some of the elements are definitely a bit "too", (too much grease, too much spitting), but the rest is so watchable I have to forgive the excesses. This is a way good time. If you want to recapture a sense of personal freedom, this is the film to give you a hand.

$REVIEW.: What a whirlwind year is Foxx having!!!  Nominated for three Golden Globes for "Ray," "Collateral," and the television film "Redemption," the actor is a shoo-in to get an Oscar nod this spring.  It is obvious that the former stand-up comic and television star is a force of reckoning in the entertainment industry."Ray" allows Foxx to showcase his superb gift of mimicry for he totally immerses himself in the role of the late musical legend.  In each scene in which he is featured, the actor is not just playing a role, he IS Ray Charles.Brilliantly supporting Foxx are Kerry Washington as long-suffering and supportive wife "Della Bea," Regina King as one Charles's back-up singers, and Sharon Warren is unforgettable as Ray's mother "Aretha."  Aunjanue Ellis is also superb as "Mary Ann Fisher," another singer that had her designs on Charles.Young actors C.J. Sanders and Terrone Bell are most effective as young "Ray" and "George," respectively.It is also refreshing to see Clifton Powell, an actor frequently cast as a "heavy," in the role of "Jeff Brown," a trusted friend and aide of the blind singer.Director Taylor Hackford also deserves credit for bringing out the best in each performer, as well as having a good eye for the period.  The costuming, the set pieces, and the tone of the flick capture the 50's and 60's marvelously.

It wasn't as true to the comic book as I would have liked. Frank Castle seemed to be playing a lot of games with the criminals instead of just killing them when he had the chance. Also, they made the punisher seem kind of weak in spots and not the unstoppable monster that he usually is.I will say that Thomas Jane is a better actor than Dolph Lungren and there was more of a story in this movie.

$REVIEW.: Jane Eyre,the new film by Fukunaga,is an attempt to take a well-worn subject by an outsider new film-maker, shows a film faithful to its source material,while Buffini's screenplay introduces flashbacks to avoid the straightjacket of chronology-the film opens dramatically with Jane(Wasikowska) stumbling across the moors in distress,she's fleeing from Thornfield Hall,from the gothic mansion full of Rochester's(Fassbender)secrets and her wedding to Rochester,which has been disrupted by her knowledge of his mad wife.The film hinges on Wasikowska's excellent Jane,the plain governess,with her mix of purity,independence,defiance and lonely yearning. Her scenes with Fassbinder are repletewith witty repartee, honesty,and understated repressed passion. There is an edge to their scenes together:"Your gaze is very direct Miss Eyre.Do you think me handsome?"-he taunts.After the opening introduction to St.John Rivers and his sisters we go back through a tale of sorry woe to her childhood.Sally Hawkins plays Jane's aunt with a Dickensian cruelty.Lowood,the charity school where she is bullied by sadistic teachers.She later becomes a teacher there.She becomes a paid subordinate in Thornfield.She first meets him by frightening his horse and he gets thrown and injured.She gets to know him through the kindly but fussy Miss Fairfax(Dench).Jane and Rochester become friends and she rescues him when fire breaks out in the house.The gothic nature of the house is highlighted by the candlelight,the oil lamps,the fire in the grate, pushing against the surrounding darkness,as well as the tales of secret people walking about,of hidden knocks, bangs,footsteps,laughter,cries.There is less light in this period movie.Jane's compelling directness and otherworldliness galvanise Rochester's jaded Byronism.The film's virtue is a straightforward sincerity,a quietness of style and mood suited to austere times.The style is neo-realism,a pared-down costuming,chilly natural light,slate-and-earth colour palette,precise cinematography,and the use of period language,intonation and dialect.There is a referencing of the spiritual and supernatural,the distancing sense of the `past as a foreign country'.Marinelli's classical score has a Romantic impulse between humanfigure and engulfing landscapes.The movement of the story is from Jane's "poor,obscure" selfhood and self-possession to equality with the older Rochester.We are immersed in a mythic,timeless narrative world:"I imagine things I am powerless to execute"in an "invisible kingdom of spirits".The darker elements of the novel,centred around Bertha Mason,her madness,the colonial Caribbean backdrop,Rochester's brooding intensity,are largely left out.Fassbinder is the actor de nos jours,but he lacks the depth of previous incarnations,Welles,Dalton and Hurt.A striking directorial achievement nevertheless,renewing the appeal of a timeless classic.

I love Horror movies more then most, and usually enjoy blood, guts and gore more then most, but here it's just overkill. Not a complete waste, I'm not going to lie to ya, there are a couple of cool death scenes, but most are lost in a bright shade of red blood and green and yellow insides and endtrails...........The monster themselves are very cheap and poor looking, and there movement kinda reminds me of the kids in South Park. Watching them 'mate' was not a fun sight to behold!! I apologize for being so negative about this, but trust me, no matter how many buckets of blood and gore you dump on this, it's still just a standard run-of-the-mill monster movie. We've all seen it before. A strong cast would have helped, but what small glimmer of hope we might have when we see Bruce Campbell in the beginning is quickly dashed as they kill him off 5 MINUTES LATER!!!! Huh?

$REVIEW.: I remember seeing this movie as a adolescent, and felt it was a little too wordy


Now I look at it, and discovered so many nuances not before acknowledge when I watched previously


I would have to say the movie was created years beore its time
I loved it, which I was I had to get so I can look at it again and again! I loved George Sanders easy manipulation of Dorian, who in the end Dorian gets his revenge


Throughout the movie, there were many other enchanting details


For instance, the look on Dorian's face as George Sanders narrates and seems to be Dorian's inner voice, and how Dorian's expression ties into it.Really loved the movie.Also, I've also seen the current Dorian Grey movie


It's good too! Definitely can see that this generation needs a little more graphics! Although, I did enjoy it as well!But I do like the classics!

$review_text.: I bought this movie based on a recommendation made by a British defence affairs blog.  It's based on a play written by David Haig, the actor who plays Rudyard Kipling in the movie.I learned something new about military history in commenting about this film elsewhere.  I thought the fact that the troops wore no helmets was a technical mistake.  The movie takes place in/around 1915 before steel helmets were issued to British and Empire troops.In spite of that, I give it 4 stars for the interesting way it shows Kipling's emotional/intellectual tug-of-war between believing in World War 1 as a just war (in spite of the scale of loss & sacrifice), and the agony of losing a son to said war.Didn't think of Harry Potter once when seeing Daniel Radcliffe playing Kipling's son, John.

$review_text.: Stalker girlfriend, evil cult, a serial killer, an insane vigilante, boy genius detective, international terrorist, kidnapping, murder, a mischievous imp, and the god of space and time are all key elements of this anime. This is probably the most insane anime since Code Geass. Plot twists are lurking around every corner, full of suspense. You can never expect the events in this anime, and when you think you have seen the craziest twist, another one will present itself to you later in that episode.Deus ex Machina, the god of space and time, declares to abdicate his prestigious throne to one human, but he must find a worthy candidate. He gives twelve individuals a future diary, a device that predicts the holder's future. Whosoever survives this game of murder will ascend Deus ex Machina's lead as the god of space and time. The game is sort of like the theme of anime like Fate Stay Night or Eden of the East. Also note that if the diary holder's personal journal should be destroyed, the user will die as well. The specifics are all explained in the first episode, and the rules of this game are not really difficult to follow.The main character of this anime is a middle school boy named Yukiteru Amano. He originally believed that he was the only one who can read the future, but is quickly proven wrong. As interesting as the plot is, the truly fascinating aspect is Yuki's stalker girlfriend, Yuno Gasai. She is a very unstable pink haired girl, who will do anything for Yuki. Her diary tells her about the future of Yuki in ten minute increments. It becomes disturbing when she knows exactly what he is doing at all times. She is also very skilled with knives, swords, axes, and anything else she happens to get her hands on. Her presence in this series is so frightening and unpredictable, that she becomes the true driving force of the anime. If she is not in the show for about 5 minutes, you start to miss her, even though she may be the most frightening and mentally unstable anime character ever.Notably Funimation had a good time with this anime because the show is so insane, that they could write anything for the script that they wanted to, and that is fine. However, the English dub takes a lot of liberties, and the dub seems quite "Americanized." Just be careful if you are used to the original version, and then go to the English because the lingo is different.Keep in mind that this DVD set is only for the first 13 episodes out of 26. Episode 13 does end on a cliffhanger, so it forces you to watch the second half immediately. The DVD does not have too many special features to speak of, but the limited edition set does come with 2 Valentine cards that are quite fitting for this show.Overall, this is probably the most exciting anime I have seen in awhile. Death Note and Code Geass are probably the only other anime that can attempt the craziness and the tension that this series exhibits.

$REVIEW.: I could not believe that no one had written a review for this lovely movie.  The story that is told here (with quite a bit of hollywood license) relates to an actual incident involving an US citizen Ion Perdicaris and his wifes' son whom were kidnapped by Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli - a bandit.  The movie changes the names and characters somewhat but stays true to the spirit of the times.  The Raisuli is played masterfully by Sean Connery - there is just the right amount of dash, ego and terror in the mix to make him memorable.  Candice Bergen plays Ms. Pedicaris (note the name/gender change) whom with her two children are kidnapped for ransom.  The interplay between Bergen and Connery is electric and suggests the clash between Muslim and Western beliefs that echoes on the horizon today in the modern Arabic states.  Equally satisfying is the portrayal of Theodore Roosevelt by Brian Keith - Mr. Keith brings the vigor, the bluster and the adolescent qualities that we think applies to Teddy Roosevelt to the screen.  Teddy is indeed bigger than life and ultimately too human as well.The movie is directed by John Milius - a man noted for his attention to detail.  So much so that the uniforms, the weapons and military procedure of the golden era are correct and are distinct characters within the movie.You will find an additional character actor of note - John Huston as Secretary of State John Hay - who counterbalances President Roosevelts' bluster with expressions of concern about political acumen and snatches of sarcasm. While some liberties have been taken with the original facts, this in no way detracts from the power of this movie as entertainment and provides this viewer with an occasional afternoon of enchantment filled with visions of warriors dashing across the screen fighting back the machine gun and modern weapons with the simple tools of courage, honor and the bluff.  Highly recommended!!!!!

$REVIEW.: The film only decribes a few of the battles that took place ine Gettysburg over the 3 days.  So this is not a full accounting.  Having just visited Gettysburg National Park, the battles and carnage are still difficult to imagine, and the film only partly explores this.  It's also got a dramatic flair and, I think, General RE Lee (Martin Sheen) seems a little too pie-in-the-sky Southern idealist to be perceived as a great tactican and important General.  All that said, the movie is one of the best depictions of the Civil War.

Still if you love the movie V:  than you will like these as well. There is plenty of suspense and action to keep you amused and some of the ideas are great. I rated this an A grade and is still very watchable. So collect your popcorn and retire to the television, prop your feet up and relax to a night of entertainment of aliens and humans.

$REVIEW.: I guess it's important to mention that I did, in fact, enjoy watching people talk about The Smiths. The contributors were journalists and critics as well as some producers and engineers who worked with the band; And let's not forget Craig Gannon, a.k.a. the 5th Smith. The commentary was more enjoyable than insightful for the most part. You'll get more out of reading the books that you probably already own. Although I found Gannon interesting in that he really seems to respect the band so much despite his obviously feeling that he got screwed over and badly mistreated.As others have noted, the quiz is fun... I also got 20 which graded out as "Excellent". Otherwise the extras are lacking. I was somewhat disappointed that the commentary basically just tracks the singles chronologically. I would've preferred more talk on the albums as a whole and also some talk from a wider range of critics about how the guys stack up in rock (or at least British rock) history.Oh well, it's not perfect but as a collector I'm not as disappointed as others.

When I first saw the trailers for it I thought it would not be that funny, but a friend convinced me to watch an episode. The blend of the surreal story-lines and tight scripts make it a comic masterwork. The box should include a warning that it may induce loss of bladder control.

$review_text.: At first glance and hearing, this colorful 1981 (so the credits claim) broadcast production of Smetana's 1870 comic masterpiece seems to be the ideal authentic Czech performance.  But the eyes benefit less than the ears (and maybe the salivary glands).  Singing and orchestral direction and execution are just about perfect, and the immediate yet reverberant stereo sound also satisfies.  But this turns out to be one of those made-for-TV-movies with post-dubbed sound and endless full-face closeups.  On screen, the singers pretend to sing but mainly act--very broadly as befits a folk-based marriage farce--while the music emanates from a place very different from the TV studio where the video was shot.  The "silent stage" result looks not operatic but more like a daytime soaper.  I envy the many viewers who won't be as put off by this effect as I am.  Smetana perhaps wrote more persuasively for the orchestra than he did for the voice, and it's the famous Overture and Dances that carry the opera rather than  the lengthy but less memorable arias.  Although the dancing--there's plenty of it--is very fine, the boisterous boys and girls of the ballet corps tend to intrude too frequently in almost every scene.  Musically the disc is a delight.  Also culinarily--does anyone have a recipe for the spectacular Bohemian "pizza" served and consumed with gusto and superb local Pilsener beer at the inn in "Act II"?  (No act divisions, curtains, or other effort to give the illusion of a theater in this production).  If Qualiton, the distributor, were to include a coupon good for some Czech pastries as shown in the film, I'd withdraw my objections.

$REVIEW.: I must foremost thank Wellspring, the distributor of this film, for releasing this Almod&oacute;var masterpiece on DVD..however..I am not sure who was behind this release..but, being familiar with the original release of this film..I was shocked and perplexed for the fact that this DVD issue is an EDITED version, cutting off approx. 15 mins of this film. I dont know WHy they did this, or what...I felt they cut off some important scenes..#1..Yolana Bell's opening number, where we first see her performing..she did  a song called &quot;Dime&quot; (which is in fact, a Spanish version of Morris Albert's &quot;Feelings&quot;)#2. a conversation among the Redeeming sisters and a redeemed girl from the past, where they run into each other on the Sister's outdoor stand, where they sell cakes, flowers and peppers.#3. The Sisters' explaining to nuns from their mother chapter, that they had been robbed, talking it over the punch bowl. Also cutting off a funny line, where the sisters gossip over a younger nun, saying that &quot;she's far to pretty for this vocation, but time will take care of that&quot;#4. A small bit of Sister Rat From Sewer's opening speech before Yolanda's performance for the Mother Superior's birthday party. in this DVD issue, they go straight to Sister Rat talking on stage, completely taking out her peeking out from the curtain and quieting down the crowd.but ultimately, I am happy that this movie saw the light of day AGAIN, it had been out of print on video for years..so, its a great buy, but be bewared that it's edited. If u have never seen this movie before, then it wont be a problem. Hardcore fans like myself might have a problem.

$review_text.: First off, I am a huge Tom and Jerry fan. The idea of cat vs mouse should not work so well, but it does. Even with little dialogue these are some of the funniest shorts I have ever seen. To me they are just as good as the Looney Tunes shorts. Although there are several single disc releases of the toons, I knew if I waited long enough we would get a box set of them. Also many of the single disc releases are censored, which is absolutely rediculous. Now we get a 2 disc set of 40 remastered shorts that are supposedly (and hopefully) uncensored. That would be the way to do it since they were meant to be seen in all of their original glory.I have searched everywhere but I can't find an episode listing yet. Maybe the studio hasn't released that yet, but I did find info on extras for the set:Commentary by Jerry Beck on The Zoot Cat, Heavenly Puss and Kitty Foiled. Also on Jerry Dances With Gene Kelly, Tom and Jerry Swim With Esther WilliamsBehind The Tunes:The MGM Orchestra--20 minute documentary on the music from the showHow Bill and Joe Met Tom and Jerry--origin of the series lasting 27 minutes.Sneek PeeksFrom the information we have been given, this looks to finally give the right treatment for some of the greatest toons of all-time. And I am hyped that Heavenly Puss will be on here, it is a favorite of mine. The price of this set is perfect, and for $[...] you get 40 full, supposedly uncensored Tom and Jerry shorts. Any fan of the series should not pass this up especially at Amazon's low pre-order price. Hopefully they will release an episode listing soon, but be assured that this promises to be a great release.

$REVIEW.: This movie, when made, was hard-core science fiction.  Hard-core in the sense that it sought to make realistic scenes.  Compare the silence of the spacecraft here to the arcade-style jet noises that accompany spacecraft in the likes of "Star Wars" or most other sf films to follow.  Also observe the stiff-legged walk of the stewardess in space, and the inelegant hats designed to keep long hair from floating haphazardly around the head.  Realism was sought, and successfully attained, to the satisfaction of hard-core sf standards.  This is one dramatic science fiction film, not the action/adventure sf flicks that one has come to expect with the rise of "Star Wars" and later movies.This movie is certainly a classic, and no science fiction collection is complete without it.  However, it is becoming rapidly dated (title aside) by obervation of the little things: clothing styles, hairstyles, the computer hardware, and even the space food.  Outside of these little clues that tell of the film's age, the story and movie is on a level all its own.

$REVIEW.: I am a big fan of Farscape in particular and science fiction in general. I watch Farscape for entertainment and as long as I am entertained by an episode, I give it high ratings.  Even so, Farscape is one of the most original series on tv.  There are good stories, interesting characters and the alien monsters are original and unique.  Some episodes are better than others I'll admit, but quite honestly I enjoy them all.  I am pleased to see the season two DVDs in a four episode format.  The more episodes I can get with one purchase, the better.  I too would like to see more extra features on the DVDs so the viewers can learn more about what it takes to product this great show and see what goes on behind the scenes.  I have all the season one DVDs and plan to collect all episodes that are released.  Thanks to Jim Henson and company.

$review_text.: This is such an awesome 2 disc collection.  I thought no DVD collection could top the Pet Shop Boys Pop Art but I think this trumps that.  The first disc contains a lot of INXS videos, I think 25.  The reason I say I think is because I have heard their are hidden videos.  Also, I noticed the video for &quot;Dancing On The Jetty&quot; isn't on here and I know one exists I saw it on Launch.  The videos look awesome and the title screen is easy to navigate and interesting to look at.Disc two contains mega extras like live performances and much more.  The packaging is nice and the discs are arranged so they almost lye on top of one another.  If you watch the videos on disc one in order you can hear commentary from group members.There are a few things that I noticed.  If you select a video and go to it on the menu and watch a video, it's followed by commentary of the following video.  You can just skip the commentary.  If you hit the skip, it will take you to the commentary for the next video, so essentially you have to go back to the disc menu to select the video.The DVD also includes a full color booklet.  It''s just a really great collection with a ton of extras. I will be enjoying this for weeks.

$review_text.: I first saw this in the 1980s late night on cable.  I loved it.  The unexpected humor, the Kick-butt female leads, the romantic hero, the crazy scientist, the "changed" cannibals, and let's not forget the comet.So many of the "horror" films during this time were the slash-em soft porn kind.  This one was refreshing as it actually had a beginning, middle and an end.  Regina, the older sister takes her responsibilities seriously while Julie the younger just wants to have some fun.  When I purchased this recently, I thought it would be too dated.  While the haircuts and language are definitely 80s, the story itself and the action was not.I had no problems with the physical disk or the quality of the picture.I HIGHLY recommend this gem of a cult classic.

$review_text.: I do not remember this movie being in the theaters, but am so glad I found it to watch at home.  It is not your predictable mystery.  There is lots of action to hold your interest.  And the ending was not at all what I expected.  Like most movies, this has its mistakes.  For example, how does he still have useable money after having been submerged in water?  Liam Neeson is not one of my favorite actors, but he did a great job in this thriller.  Highly recommend.

$review_text.: FBI agent Terry McCaleb (Clint Eastwood)is retired from the Agency when he suffers a heart attack while chasing a suspect. He has a heart transplant and one day a young woman Graciella Rivers (Wanda de Jesus) turns up at his boat asking him to find out who murdered her sister in a bodega robbery. She appeals to his sense of duty as the heart McCaleb has transplanted into him was that of Rivers' sister. Rivers' sister also had a little boy, Raymond Torres (Mason Lucero), and Rivers says she wants justice for him too. McCaleb agrees, much to the consternation of his cardiologist, Dr Bonnie Fox (Anjelica Huston). To help him get around McCaleb hires his neighbour boat-owner, Jasper `Buddy' Noone (Jeff Daniels). There are various red herrings in the investigation but the story is resolved convincingly in the end. There's also plenty of action - too much for someone with a new heart! But it's like a milder version of the Dirty Harry movies.

$REVIEW.: I was in love with Titanic and agreed that it should have won every award it did....that is untill I saw L.A. Confidential. This movie blew my mind. The plot was fascinating, an inside look of the workings of the L.A.P.D in  the 50's. The directing, cinematography, all of the designings were  astounding. Its also one of those rare films that the script pretty much  stick to the novel. The acting was flawless, Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe  (in a powerhouse performance) and Guy Pierce were all overlooked at Oscar  time. It truly is one of the best movies of the 90's, right up there with  American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List. If you havent  seen this movie yet, go out and rent it, and I doubt you'll be  dissapointed. However, I must warn you that the begining is a little slow,  but it soon picks up the pace....pay attention or else you might not get  the ending.

The actors are amazingly well selected, the soundtrack is epical, the non stop tension during each show, all the ingredients for a perfect tv series, even if you are not a sci-fi fan.The blu-ray edition is a giant step forward, the improvement on video and audio are definitely worth it!!!

$REVIEW.: We are in Moldavia, 1630. The beautiful princess asia and her lover Javuto are sent to death by Asia's brother. But Asa, who is a vampire put a curse on her brother's descendants and vows to get for revenge.Two centuries later, 1830, Dr. Choma and his assitant, Andre Gorobec travel through Moldavia. They are travelling by coach and a coach wheel breaks. So as it may be expected they have to continue on foot in the direction of a howling voice. Eventually they discover the tomb of Asa. A bat attacks Choma, he cuts his hand and the spilled blood drips onto Asa`s face.When they leave the crypt they find Katia who looks like a twin of Asa, who tells them about her impoverished existence with his brother and his father. While Asa is revived thanks to Choma's blood. She calls for Javuto and so he obeys her and he goes the castle and enter the Prince's room.But Choma mistakenly thinks Javuto is Boris, the servant of Katia and is fatallyambushed. He will become vampire due Asa sucks blood from his neck.Choma kills the Prince and then Asa asks for Javuto tio bring her to Katia because her blood will become her immortal.This is basically the main dramatic structure of a film based on a story of Gogol The Vij. The result was quite successful, not only because the full rounded and anguishing plot but the way the legend, the curse, the horror and the vengeance interweave roles becoming perhaps one of the three most reminded horror films ever made in the history of cinema.

$review_text.: If I could give &#34;North by Northwest&#34; 4 1/2 stars I would.  But that doesn't seem possible.  The storyline, cast, special effects, sets, and scenery are fine but I don't think the movie overall is quite as good as &#34;Vertigo.&#34;  That film I regard as Hitchcock's masterpiece and it wouldn't be right to give &#34;North by Northwest&#34; the same rating.As to the quality of the video and audio transfer, those are also topnotch in &#34;North by Northwest.&#34;  The scene in the open prairie with a crop duster chasing Cary Grant has to be one of the most memorable and well-done special effects in cinematic history.  Never mind that it doesn't make a lot of sense to the plot to have such a deadly scene in the middle of nowhere.Climbing around on facsimile faces of Mt. Rushmore is also very well done, but again implausible anyone could be allowed access.  As with other of Hitchcock's movies, we must learn to suspend logic and plausibility and just enjoy the ride.This is a long movie but worth the time in many ways.  Highly recommended action/mystery/thriller.

$REVIEW.: I'm pleased to see that the 2001 anime effort "Noir" is being re-released in the DVD market after having been unavailable for too long a period
With so much anime product (of vastly varying degrees of quality) hitting the home entertainment arena, it's nice to be able to recommend a piece that has always felt distinctly different amongst its competition


I would contend that "Noir" is a thoughtful, introspective, and moody series driven as much by character as by violent mayhem
In as much, it may not be the top choice for today's most action oriented viewers

Methodically paced and driven by a haunting score, this enigmatic tale will likely hook you or lose you from its earliest episodes

Unraveling its central mysteries like a fine novel, I was instantly intrigued by this show--and, although it wasn't exactly what I expected, I found this to be a top choice for adult viewers looking for a richness and complexity lacking from some other mainstream titles.Ostensibly a tale of female assassins, the primary focal point of "Noir" comes when a deadly contract killer is contacted by a young woman with no memory


The ladies form an unlikely alliance as both are haunted by the past and this new bond offers an opportunity to expose dark truths and a chance at redemption


Our amnesiac displays some uncanny physical abilities that seem perfect for this new violent lifestyle and the women soon find themselves enmeshed in some rather nefarious plots
But, at heart, this is very much a character piece

With frequent flashbacks, we are invited into the past experiences of both as we get up to speed on their current circumstances


And through it all, we're left to contemplate what the recovered memory will reveal and how it will affect this new found friendship.A quasi-feminist production, most men are presented as villains while women take most of the more traditional hero roles
The central action over the course of the show comes via gunfights and other hand to hand combat
For anime, it is not excessively violent or graphic--but there sure are lots of animated bullets flying! But again, for me, the action sequences served as back-up to the human drama
If you're looking for a slow build entertainment with a bit of moral ambiguity, this does spend considerable effort on character development and showcases how the choices we make shape our moral compass

Thoughtful and adult, I recommend this only to viewers who think that thoughtful and adult are plusses in anime
Quick fix action die-hards may want to peruse other choices

KGHarris, 4/11.

I probably missed it because the series was on cable which I still do not have.The show has a good premise, that in the future corporations call the shots on society whether it be law or politics.Robots and recall memories and virtual reality are all explored. The show is good sci fi entertainment and really deserves a look.I have been following sci fi for many years and was quite surprised this show was not heard from while on cable at the time it aired. I believe that more fans might have enjoyed it, if it saw sydication or a regular network slot. It is a good show and I do think the writing is up to par with other shows with much larger followings.Give it a try I hope you will enjoy it.

$review_text.: Eve's Bayou is a spectacular movie. The color and scenery is wonderful and the people are elegant and troubled. Even the character's names stir up visions of dark swamp water and sultry heat. The story is told and seen through the eyes of little Eve Batiste played by a wonderful young actress named Jurnee Smollett. Eve takes us deep into her world which is filled with colorful characters and complex personalities.Diahann Carroll is fabulous as the old fortune teller Elzora with her insane laughter. Debbi Morgan as Aunt Mozelle Batiste Delacroix is something to behold. Aunt Mozelle has promised her family that she will not use her &quot;second sight&quot; to tell fortunes, but neighbors won't let her keep her promise. They seek her out to find missing husbands anyway. Lynn Whitfied as the manor born wife is beautiful and poised as she tries to keep her family together in spite of her wandering husband (Samuel L. Jackson). Jackson is very sexy in this movie and his character has roving eyes as well as roving hands that don't stop even when he is caught in a compromising position by his youngest daughter, Eve. This starts a set of events that lead to the total destruction of an already deeply troubled family.Although this movie did not make history at the box office my guess is that it will become a cult classic. Years from now this movie will be viewed for what it is, a brilliantly produced film. You can literally feel the Louisiana heat from Eve's Bayou. Vannie

$REVIEW.: First, I don't understand the barage of bad reviews because of the home video-like filming of the movie.  This was one of the most publicized aspects of this film!  This is not Godzilla or Alien vs. Predator or King Kong.  The movie was made to capture the plight of a group of people as they try to escape the wrath of a huge monster destrying Manhattan.That being said, this movie was better than I expected.  And that's saying something, because I was amped to see this since the preview in front of Transformers.I loved the home movie quality that started with a going away party for Rob.  A party that had the normal scenes of a guy (Hud) shyly chasing after a hot girl (Marlena) and the tension between a guy and a girl that are obviously in love but won't talk to each other (Rob and Beth).  Just as the Rob-Beth issue starts getting old, all hell breaks loose.  From that point on the film is incredibly intense.Glimpses of the monster are seen right away as it dismantles the city.  We get a few closer looks of the creature as our heroes rush through the city.  And I have to say, this monster is awesome.  Nothing like Godzilla, King Kong, or anything ever seen destroying a city.  I recommend watching the extras afterwards to hear the writer, director, and FX folks talking about it.Without going into plot, I will say that I loved the story-line.  Uncomplicated and straitfoward.  Clover (as the monster is referred to by the director) is on the loose and wreaking havoc.  Will our band of party goers make it out of the city?  Will the creature be defeated?  What the heck is the creature?  It doesn't matter.  This is one of the most original horror/thriller flicks in a long time.  Intense, scary, funny, gory, and intense (did I say that already).  I highly recommend this film...but remember, it's filmed camcorder-style.

$REVIEW.: When I first saw this, I had took a double take and wondered if what I was watching was actually a serious production

It turned out to be so."Matthew: The Visual Bible" is an attempt to bring the Bible to life by using the script from the NIV translation of Matthew alone
There are no added bits or license taken with the version of the Bible used


What you hear is the NIV translation with some pictures to go with it

Of course, the characters themselves speak the words that are attributed to them, so it is more than just some pastor reading the bible to cute pictures.Probably the first thing to be noticed is the location used

It looks remarkably un-Middle Eastern, right down to the rather Scottish looking disciple, (I believe that was Peter), and the blue eyed Jesus

Sometimes the acting left something to be desired, and there was often a moment when a group of us were literally reduced to tears of laughter.However, in this production's defence, it did manage to bring a more humorous interpretation to the figure of Jesus, making him seem more human and reachable
There are times when you can also see the anger and the frustration that he felt, but the accessible nature of Jesus is always there
This was something I found to be appealing about the whole thing, and compensated somewhat for the el cheapo short-cuts taken in other aspects."The Passion of the Christ" this is not, and it does give some depth to the people we read about in the Bible

However, it is certainly not an epic production on the scale of "The Ten Commandments"

You might have a bit of a fit with a bunch of Americans dressed shabbily as first century Jews in Roman Judea.

$REVIEW.: I don't know why I didn't see this film on it's original theatrical run back in 1981. I saw &quot;The Jerk&quot; at least 3 times a few years earlier. Maybe I didn't want to see the &quot;wild and crazy guy&quot; in a dark role. It's just as well I didn't see it then because I probably wouldn't have appreciated the film's considerable merits. I'm not a big fan of musicals per se but the period music is great and the sets and dancing are good, too. But it's Steve Martin's performance as the heel that stands out. Why is this such a good performance? Because you hate the things that Martin's Arthur Parker does yet you do not hate the character. You can empathize with his explanations for his malevolent attitude. A bonus here is Christopher Walken's cameo as a lothario who seduces the &quot;good&quot; Bernadette Peters to the bad side. You can say this film was ahead of it's time, but it's doubtful that it would find a wide audience today. Because of the darkness of it's themes, I'm surprised it was ever made at all.

$review_text.: Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining is widely regarded as one of the best films of the horror genre and contains some of the most iconic images of not only horror films, but films in general. Like all of Kubrick's films, the initial reception wasn't very positive but time has been good to The Shining. Still today, it's a film that polarizes some viewers; many feel it's too cold, too slow-moving while others regard as it as another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces from the great director. Now, with its availability on Blu-Ray, one is finally allowed to fully appreciate Kubrick's perfectionism. I saw this film for the first time on television at the age of five, tuning in quite late but finding myself glued to the screen. Fourteen years later, and having seen it many times since, I still notice new things about the film. Watching it on Blu-Ray, I can tell you that the iconic images that make up this film have never looked better.Everyone is familiar with the beautiful, scenic opening helicopter shot and the haunting music that accompanies it. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a former schoolteacher, arrives at the Overlook Hotel to take a job as the winter caretaker. The hotel is closed between October and May, with the 25-mile stretch of road leading to it averaging 20-feet of snow. Jack intends to stay there with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd), while taking advantage of the seclusion to work on a novel. Once they arrive to begin their stay, Danny, who has been having horrifying visions of the hotel courtesy of his imaginary friend Tony, meets the chef Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers), who possesses a telepathic gift similar to Danny's. Soon, the family is all alone at the hotel and as the snow starts covering everything in sight, Danny's visions become more horrifying and Jack begins a slow descent into madness.Few films produce so many iconic images. Audiences that haven't seen this film can identify many of them. Danny riding his bike through the halls of the Overlook, the image of the two dead girls, and the blood pouring from the elevators are some of the most recognizable moments in cinematic history. Then of course there's the legendary scene with Jack Nicholson that is featured on nearly every piece of promotional material for the film. For all of its disturbing and even violent imagery, there's less blood and gore than one would expect from a horror film of this stature. The strength of Kubrick's filmmaking is that many people remember The Shining as a violent film, which it really isn't. Even with a miniscule amount of violence, this film contains some of the most nightmarish images in all of cinema. Kubrick strayed drastically from King's source novel, but the masterpiece that came as a result is much more psychological, ambiguous, and terrifying. Anyone who says differently must remember that nearly every truly iconic scene in the film comes from Kubrick, not King. The flip-side of the argument could be that, arguably, the scariest, most unexplainable, and downright creepy scene, which features a man in a bear (or is it a dog?) suit came from King's novel.Kubrick seemed to always be working with great stories when making his films, but his emphasis was always on form and that's what makes this film stand as tall as it did 31 years ago. The red color motif, the static images of two girls, the blood slowly pouring from the elevator, the score that wonderfully accentuates and strengthens the effect of the filmmaking; these are the things people take away from the film. Kubrick was a photographer before he was a filmmaker and this film really honors his ability to frame a shot of innocent, common things and make them terrifying. The film's majestic, jaw-dropping, unexplained and perhaps unexplainable final shot has baffled viewers for years and given them plenty to analyze/discuss. It's the poetry of these shots that make The Shining possibly the most elegant horror film ever made.The characters are also memorable, but this is because of the actors more than the characters. Not that the characters are underwritten, but the acting is what burns them into your cinematic memory. This is true also for the Overlook Hotel, which is the silent character in the film. As a concept, the hotel is terrifying but the way it appears under Kubrick's direction makes it all the more so. The performance Danny Lloyd managed to give without knowing he was in a horror film is remarkable. It's fine work by a child actor. The late, great Scatman Crothers has such a warm, endearing screen presence that can also be stern and frightening. Duvall must play distressed in almost every scene and the stress that she suffered during the shoot shows in her performance, giving it a real sense of intensity. Philip Stone gives the most oft-overlooked (no pun intended) performance as Delbert Grady. Rarely mentioned in discussions, I invite you to consider how quietly frightening his performance is and how quickly and seamlessly he goes from cheerful normality to terrifying menace.Then there's the legendary Jack as Jack performance. Few actors can conjure up genuine menace in quite the same way Jack Nicholson can, especially when they're going over the top the way Jack Nicholson does. Nicholson has been equally praised and criticized for his performance, with some calling it disturbing and others comical. Jack does go over-the-top, bringing a lot of manic energy to the role and yet, somehow, he's pitch-perfect. He's never unintentionally funny and his teeth-gnashing, vicious performance is unmatched in the realm of performances in horror films. Jack Nicholson may not be what Stephen King had in mind when he wrote Jack Torrance, but Jack Nicholson is Jack Torrance.The Blu-Ray is not perfect. Trivial complaints are that the film begins immediately without going to the menu and the menu itself is just the special features, reminding me of older Warner Bros. DVD's. As the film began, the picture quality was not 100% perfect, slightly fuzzy. Minutes later, the film looked stunning, crisp, and able to draw one's attention to the most minute details of a shot. Nearly every shot has so much more clarity than before. Warner Bros. has a habit of double-dipping with Kubrick films (and by double, I mean I've purchased four different editions of The Shining on two formats) so you may want to wait and see what happens before buying the Blu-Ray, but don't think for a second that you'll be disappointed. I'm sure even Kubrick himself would be at least 80% pleased with the result.To this day, The Shining is criticized for pacing issues but this complaint is all about audience response. I've always found the pacing to be an intoxicating element. The Shining is a rare horror film that gets under your skin and stays with you, growing better with each viewing. It has stood the test of time and will continue to grow in stature for many years to come. Its images still terrifying even with familiarity. It is one of the greatest horror films ever made.GRADE: A-

$REVIEW.: A very original and unique film very well regarded with douglas performance masterful and a minor character his orphan like son who is nicely pictured. The film is seen through a writers life,his perceptions thoughts and relationships...and there have been hardly any films like this. At first we have a pregnant mistress and a dead dog and a dead doctor's dog,with the police interested in the doctor's dog...with all kinds of wry comments directed here. We also have a party,a party of writers and nicely done conversations briefly on a writers life and a series of suicides,the link between creation and artistry and suicide, and the orphan son here(orphan as in being abandoned)gives a long series of artists who have succumbed to death,famous and enigmatic deaths like superman icon george reeves to those suffering madness like the once famous gene tierney, and living lonely and isolated lives. Loneliness and isolation are themes here. An image that appears throughout is joe dimaggio and marilyn..its only mr coffee,n,y. joe who really understands and loves marilyn(although they were married less than a year) but his love lasted until the very end,of not only her life but his own,a transcending like experience and hollywood itself was never really good to marilyn in all kinds of ways,even absenting itself from her funeral(ill write more on this when i review a recent book),but n.y. joe appears at her funeral. N.Y. is seen as a center of artistic growth and maturityand probably a source of much good film which is often forgotten,but it is the yankees imaged throughout,and the artists but the civic authorities evidenced are largely absent. The writer leaves his wife and his former wife in a brief scene(woman rarely appear) leaves him to his new found 'young beautiful' mate. Throughout the film in a past reference somewhat anachronistically the characters use the epithets 'jesus,..christ' which is not heard from much here. There is also a brief scene with a tony...and a tuba in a trunk...the oddness of the writer'slife. Throughout the film appears the further development of the murder of the dog,and the civic authorities here concentrated on what's important to the doctor,and there are scenes of the orphan son james addictions(not to mention douglas' addictions)..and the father exhorting addiction like soon youll be munching boxes of cardboard your mind is so addict like...perhaps a reference to upcoming youth. The Douglas character looks with favour to christmas morning,with a show viewed on the 'trick of self development'...a play on the word trick to a more spiritual plain...then the movie ends with the orphan boys book being published 'the love parade' a commentary on themes throughout...and a closing with Wlaton's actor richard thomas chronicolling his new book 'marilyn-joe the last american marriage' since love has lost its permanence in the old institution...and a woman laments on Douglas new book with its geneologies(like jesus geneologies) as being the work of an 'addict.' At the end the douglas character loses wife and everything and must start over...but does have a clarifying vision...the artists view...interesting look at life seen from the vantage point of a writer with views implicit on many things,and entertaining throughout..

Henry Silva gives a 5-star performance as Chino Rivera, the convict who chooses to participate in this &quot;Alien-Exchange Progam&quot;, and plays the part of the manipulative yet sympathetic criminal with great realism. Diana Sands is excellant as a sympathetic scientist trying to help Siva's charachter, and the Chromoite is one of the coolest aliens ever to grace The Outer Limits. And the end message is as stunning as it is simplistic... all they had to do was ask for help.A definate must buy for Sci-Fi fans.

Girl goes right from high school to a short immersion tour at space academy and immediately becomes not only a commissioned officer but a pilot too.  Meanwhile, her highschool boyfriend becomes a field grunt enlisted man.  The gore was really well done.  Denise Richards is hot but never nude.  The shower scene is a turn-on but not necessarily due to the brief nudity but at the idea that the male and female recruits are so matter-of-fact about showering together.  I am embarrassed at giving this really bad, bad film 3 stars, but it is a fun dumb escape on occasion.

$review_text.: BEFORE STONEWALL, though as documentaries go is a bit heavy on personal memories and nostalgia, is otherwise perfect

It explains in ironically straightforward terms the gay history of America

In fact, on second thought it may be that the personal reminiscences add to the flavor of the film, because the interviewees are so colorful and memorable--and they are eloquent


I particularly love listening to Harry Hay, founder of the old Mattachine Society.It is natural that this film can only probe as far back as the memories of the interviewees allow: lots of reminiscences of the "demimonde" or "twilight world" of the 1920s and 1930s
Mostly, BEFORE STONEWALL leans on WWII and the fact that any gay rights movement worthy of the name in America began in the military during the war

One very charming gentleman recalls attending a lecture by gay icon and scientist Magnus Hirschfeld, who was battling for gay rights since the end of the 19th century.While the interviewees reminisce about World War II and then the McCarthy crap, they give powerful insights to the state of the gay community

This film shocked me when it divulged that the gay generation it covers was a generation of isolated, miserable people who had no idea there were others like them

At the same time, the film covers some of the silly media portrayal of "homosexual perversion".There is nothing lacking in this documentary--but I am especially happy that it is very LOW on erotica

Too many gay-themed films are quite frankly so disgusting that I cannot bear to watch them (i.e., Stephen Fry in the title role inWilde)

This documentary, narrated by Rita Mae Brown, is almost clean enough to show in schools


In fact I think high school level kids could handle it in their stride, and they'd learn all there is to learn about our sad, revolting gay history.This does not shy away from the days when gay people were treated much worse than blacks, had no rights at all and could be jailed or institutionalized at the drop of a 6" stiletto-heel
It was riveting to hear the lesbian remember how she had been arrested for institutionalization--her own mother dropped the dime on her after learning she was a lesbian.This film is THE object lesson, and all interested folk need this on their DVD shelves.

$REVIEW.: Series creator J.J. Abrams scored a coup when he got international movie star Lena Olin to sign on for the second season of "Alias".  Playing the long-lost KGB agent mother of Sydney Bristow (series star Jennifer Garner), Olin adopted many of Garner's mannerisms (including gait, a slowly widening smile, and a distinctive tucking of her long hair behind one ear) to imply an inherited bond deeper than a 20-year absence would normally signify.To these Garneresque traits Olin added a fanatical focus on her (obscure) goals.  If you've seen "Romeo is Bleeding" you'll know just how intense Olin can be.  But instead of the manic glee of the movie's Mona Demarkov, in "Alias" Olin has the calm intensity of a Zen master.  She can be sitting, perfectly still, and still project deadly menace.Irina Derevko, Lena Olin's character, is pivotal from the very start of the season.  Walking out of the shadows we (and Sydney) first see her face.  Sydney says "Mom?" -- and Irina calmly shoots her daughter.I won't go into great detail to avoid spoiling the ride for all you current (or potential) "Alias" fans.  But it's thrilling to watch Irina Derevko promoting her mysterious agenda, with the audience and Sydney never knowing exactly where her allegiances lie.  There's the usual plotline driven by creepily avuncular bad guy Arvin Sloan and his quest for the workings of 15th century prophet Milo Rambaldi.  The series changes direction halfway through with the SuperBowl episode.  And of course Sydney Bristow continues to be slicker than James Bond, but she's being steered by her mother's invisible strings more often than not this time around.  If you want to know just how a superagent like Sydney Bristow can come to be, Lena Olin as her cooler-than-ice mother is the perfect recipe.  It's a shame Abrams couldn't get Olin to return for Season Three.Notable guest stars for Season Two include Terry O'Quinn, Patricia Wettig, Amy Irving, Derek de Lint, Faye Dunaway, Angus Scrimm, Olivia D'Abo, Ethan Hawke, Christian Slater, and Tracy Middendorf.Season Two of "Alias": Highly Recommended.

$REVIEW.: Kevin James trades in his delivery uniform for a mall cop's garb in the family-friendly "Paul Blart:  Mall Cop."It's been years since Blart's wife left him and his daughter alone

 The pair are living with his mother
 While repeatedly attempting and failing to pass training at the New Jersey State Police Academy (due to his hypoglycemia), Blart holds down a job as a security guard at the local mall
 With Christmas in the near future, the mall's business has picked up.Blart finds himself attracted to a new seller, Amy (Jayma Mays), at one of the kiosks in the mall
 Self-conscious and socially awkward, Blart struggles to start a conversation with her
 As the story rolls along, Blart does build a weak friendship with Amy and is also put in charge of training a new hire.When Black Friday comes around, all chaos breaks loose
 A group of skateboarding, BMX-riding thugs take over the mall and collect a small group of hostages (including many of Blart's friends and Amy) to hold off the police

 They plan to steal credit card codes from the higher end stores in the mall and make a quick escape.The only thing standing in their way is Paul Blart
 He stumbles, bumbles and rumbles his way through the scenery, chewing up the mall like a pretzel


 At first he is scared of the idea of taking on professional criminals, but when another person is added to the group of hostages, Blart goes into "Die Hard" mode and begins taking out the criminals one by one.The result is a very funny slapstick comedy for the whole family


 There's very little strong language, limited humorous sexuality, and the cast is, for the most part, very likeable.The DVD comes with many obligatory extras including previews and deleted scenes

 Also included are featurettes on the making of the film

 My personal favorite was the featurette on the many stunts featured in the film."Paul Blart:  Mall Cop" deserves a solid three-and-one-half stars

 It's silly and clean enough for youngsters to enjoy, and the actions of James and company are smart enough to make even the most intelligent adult chuckle.Recommended to families who are longing for a comedy to watch together that isn't animated


 Also recommended to fans of slapstick comedy.

$review_text.: A little disorienting at first, this movie is such a rich tapestry with several multidimensional characters that one can't be certain where it's taking us


 The America never seen in American films (except by Haskell Wexler) defines post-9/11 bewilderment within the context of poverty, legitimate faith, and paranoia

 A second viewing--during the director's commentary--reveals that (Leonard Maltin's review to the contrary) the narrative structure is tight.The central male character conjures up the anomie of the leads in THE PARALLAX VIEW, TAXI DRIVER, and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK


 The Christian heroine is a good and decent young woman, played with freshness and sincerity and not one whiff of cynicism
The black minister, performed by one of THE WIRE's wittier regulars, offers a more true-to-life representation of black Americans' core values than almost ever reaches American TV or movie screens, and without treacle or bombastics


 One regrets the absence of close-ups in the cameo by Gloria (TITANIC, INVISIBLE MAN) Stuart, but her scene is delightful.In his commentary, Wenders repeatedly extols the use of DVD cameras that allowed him to complete 60 or 70 set-ups a day in a 16-day shoot


 The cinematography (all hand-held) is astonishingly beautiful
 And Wenders rightly praises his set designer who had only $20,000 to work with and yet came in under budget!Doubtless, the German director's background affords him the distance with which to comment so cogently on America a couple of months after Bush declared the invasion of Iraq a success

 With its documentary feel and non-mainstream perspective, LAND OF PLENTY will increase in value over the years, as a photo album of conditions and attitudes we can only hope will continue to heal.

He plays a very lucky mobster that is put into a suburbia neighborhood to hide from his murderous mob colleagues.  Originally he worked in a auto chop shop, but had to leave when the mob got tough and he had to fight for his life.  Suburbia changes him as he meets the neighbors and finds true love.

$review_text.: Santa Sangre is that "one of a kind" film that makes you feel changed somehow after a viewing. Such a statement sounds dramatic, but there are those special films out there that make you think "I'm so glad that I did not miss out on this." For me, Santa Sangre is that gem.It's hallucinatory, frightening, amusing (black humor), surreal and ultimately...tragic and sad.I won't give an entire synopsis or play by play of the movie. I don't feel like spoiling the experience for potential viewers (that's what the Wikipedia page and other reviews are for...). I prefer going into films knowing as little about the movie as possible. Why open your Christmas gifts the day before Christmas, right?That said, Santa Sangre is told in flashbacks and the present. Felix is the film's protagonist and his journey is harrowing. In a strange way, Santa Sangre is more than a horror film or a surrealist's project: it's a psychological study of human bonding, family ties/loyalty, love and culture. It's a demented coming of age story...Like a good horror film (or film, period) should do, Santa Sangre conveys social commentary and sociological and psychological subtext.The imagery of the movie is gorgeous and horrific. Much like an Argento film, there is no shortage of color, quirky charters and elaborate set-pieces here.If you've yet to see this film and you're a huge fan of the horror genre, do it now. If you've yet to see this film and you love film, see this now. Point blank: see this now.

$review_text.: This is a fine example of the kind of mystery that little old ladies from Pasadena (or Russell Square) adore


 Perhaps Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) starring Cary Grant might be comparable in its genteel and bloodless ability to glue us to the screen.This is certainly one of Hitchcock's best, but most of the credit must go to a devilishly clever play written by Frederick Knott from which he adapted the screenplay
 (He also wrote the play upon which Wait Until Dark (1967) starring Audrey Hepburn was based.)  Hitchcock does a good job in not tinkering unnecessarily with the material


 He also has the exquisitely beautiful Grace Kelly to play the part of Margot Wendice.Ray Milland plays, with a kind of high-toned Brit panache, her diabolical husband, Tony Wendice, a one-time tennis star who married mostly for security
 John Williams is the prim and proper Chief Inspector Hubbard


 He lends to the part a bit of Sherlock Holmesian flair
 One especially liked his taking a moment to comb his mustache after the case is solved
 Robert Cummings, unfortunately plays Margot's American boyfriend as inventively as a sawhorse
 For those of you who might have blinked, Hitchcock makes his traditional appearance in the photo on the wall from Tony Wendice's undergraduate days.The fulcrum of the plot is the latchkey

 It is the clue that (literally) unlocks the mystery

 There is a modernized redoing of this movie called A Perfect Murder (1998) starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow in which a similar business with latchkeys is employed


 I am not very good with clues so it was only after seeing that movie and Dial M for Murder for the second time that I finally understood what happened

 Follow the latchkey!Of course I was too distracted by Grace Kelly to fully appreciate such intricacies


 I found myself struck with the ironic notion that anyone, even a cuckolded husband, might want to kill Grace Kelly or that a jury might find her guilty of anything!  She remains in my psyche America's fairytale princess who quit Hollywood at the height of her popularity after only five years and eleven movies to become a real princess by marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco


 Something was lost there, and something was gained
 She was in essence the original Jackie Kennedy Onassis


 I think, however, that the old saw about the man who marries for money, earning it, might apply to American princesses as well.At any rate, Grace Kelly's cool and sublime bearing was on fine display here

 Hitchcock cloths her in discreet nightgowns and fitted (but certainly not clinging) dresses that show off her delicate figure and her exquisite arms and hint coyly at her subtle sexuality

 She was 25-years-old, stunningly beautiful, and in full confidence of her ability as an actress
 She had just finished starring opposite James Stewart in another splendid Hitchcock one-room mystery, Rear Window (1954), and was about to make The Country Girl (1954) with Bing Crosby for which she would win an Oscar for Best Actress.So see this for Grace Kelly who makes Gwyneth Paltrow (whom I adore) look downright gawky, and for Ray Milland whose urbane scheming seems a layer or two of hell removed from Michael Douglas's evil manipulations.By the way, the "original theatrical trailer" preceding these Warner Brothers Classic videos is what we used to call the "Coming Attractions"--that is, clips directly from the movie and a promo

 You might want to fast forward to the movie itself.

There are some parts of the movie where I laughed and laughed some more This was a Brilliant film  for Will Smith-who is known for bringing moviegoers out of the heat-and into the wll air-conditioned screens of indoor multi-plexes during the hot summer months. Kevin James was great in his big-screen debut, Look for him doing movies whenever His Show, "The King of Queens" goes off the air. Eva Mendez looks absolutely great She'll probably be THE sexiest woman... Alive! She is so HOT!!!

But after seeing it I wished that I had rented the DVD and not bought it. &quot;Big Fish&quot; is not really a film that I would think that Tim Burton would make. It more of a story about the relationship between a father and son that have not spoken in many years. The visual are good, but they don't allow Tim Burton to show the viewer what he can do. And he is great director.  &quot;Big Fish&quot; is an okay, but Tim Burton was allow to show his best work.

The music is unforgettable and perfect for each scene they put it in, the acting is unforgettable and real.  This brings the myth of King Arthur and his beautiful wife, along with her tragic lover, to life in a beautifully haunting way that grabs your heart and doesn't let go.  The writing and photography is perfect in every way.  This is a movie everyone should see!

$review_text.: Based on Joseph Conrad's book "The Duel", the true story of a 30-year feud between two Napoleonic cavalry officers, "The Duellists" was Ridley Scott's first major film. Starring Keith Carradine as the pompous D'Hubert and a particularly menacing Harvey Keitel as Feraud, the film climbs inside the minds of two men for whom honor is more important than life itself.The two antagonists begin their series of bloody encounters when D'Hubert is ordered by his commanding general to arrest Feraud for wounding the local mayor's nephew in a duel. Feraud, in a hopelessly irrational state, challenges D'Hubert to a duel, which is carried out more or less on the spot. D'Hubert comes off slightly better in the initial encounter, which only serves to fuel Feraud's rage, and the course of the film is set.The cinematography of this film, shot by Frank Tidy, is almost beyond comparison. The previous versions on VHS simply looked muddy and rather washed out. The colors lacked any real saturation, rendering Feraud's bottle-green dolman black and it almost looked like a poor quality black and white in some scenes, especially those set in Napoleon's abortive Russian campaign.The DVD transfer, by contrast, is staggeringly beautiful and releases colors, which I did not realize existed in the original. I am, by coincidence, a professional cameraman and I rate this as the best shot film I have ever seen. The only criticism I have is a somewhat inconsistent use of graduated filters, which, whilst they were probably quite innovative for their day, don't always work well. Grads are always a problem and any film made since will tend to suffer the same way. A very minor point.The costumes and settings; mostly in The Dordogne, make the film not only totally authentic but defy the viewer to believe that it was made on a shoestring budget. The visual splendour challenges any modern filmaker to create the same effect without spending a vault full of money to achieve it. That is only part of the appeal of the film.The acting performances, particularly by Keitel, want for nothing. The scene with Feraud standing on a cliff overlooking the river valley, taken in context, makes you realise that his life and pretensions to honor have been for nothing. His mania for revenge has cost him everything. Melded to the other performances with superlative skill by Ridley Scott, this film is a masterpiece and has now gone from a film I liked a lot to one which is now firmly wedged in my top ten. Like as not, it will stay there for a long time.

$review_text.: The usually astute critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper declared Gus Van Sant's "Elephant" "brilliant" and Roeper put it high on his ten best list for 2003.  They especially praised Van Sant for refusing to provide any answers for the school shooting spree it depicts.  Sorry guys, you got it so wrong this time.  Yes, Van Sant is right not to present any answers to a problem that has none.  But shouldn't he have at least asked some relevant questions?What we have here is 60 minutes of absolutely nothing leading up to 15 minutes of vile and pointless carnage.  No plot, no character development of any kind, no humor, nothing.  The camera simply follows several high school stereotypes (the cute nerd, the photographer, the weirdo, the jock and his girlfriend, three anorexic bimbos, etc.) as they walk through the school during the same ten minute time span (viewed over-and-over again for one solide hour) then follows two homosexual psychopaths as they blow all but one away in sickening detail. Fade to Black.Actually, all through "Elephant" I kept thinking about the painter Jackson Pollock.  I can imagine Pollock accidentally spilling a couple of buckets of paint on a campus, then as a joke signing it and stuffing it away in storage.  After his death, this work of art is discovered and art critics everywhere spend hours studying Pollock's technique and declaring what was nothing but a mistake a brilliant work of art, while the public shakes their head in bewilderment.  That is "Elephant" in a nutshell.  It's as pointless as bad "art" can be, with no effort, thought or insight expended by its "auteur" director, who I wouldn't be surprised meant the whole thing as a sick joke and is sitting up in Portland laughing at those who think this pointless mess is somehow meaningful.As far as calling the killers homosexuals, of course I know Van Sant is gay and I doubt he really is trying to blame gays for school shootings.  But what then is the point of showing these two making out naked in the shower unless Van Sant is looking for blame (or a cheap thrill)?  It's confusing and insulting to gays who must be getting really tired of being scapegoated for all of society's problems.As for Gus Van Sant, this guy has to be the most overrated director of all time.  He's made two great movies ("My Own Private Idaho" and "Drugstore Cowboys"), one entertaining box office smash and its equally entertaining copycat ("Good Will Hunting" and "Finding Forrester") and everything else has been absolute garbage (the "Psycho" remake, "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues," "Gerry," this debacle).  And poor Timothy Bottoms.  He starts his career with one of the greatest movies ever made ("The Last Picture Show") which incidentally dealt sensitively and incisively with teenagers, and now in middle age he's relegated to playing second fiddle to a bunch of awful amateur teen actors from Portland, who wouldn't pass muster in a high school production of "Bang, Bang You're Dead."  Incidentally, buy the great Showtime version of "Bang, Bang..." starring Tom Cavanaugh and Ben Foster.  It covers the same ground, offers no easy solutions and gives us characters to care about to boot.Ironically, "Elephant" won grand prize at the Cannes film festival over Clint Eastwood's "Mystic River."  "Elephant" went on to tank at the U.S. box office while "Mystic River" was a solid hit, a Best Picture Oscar nominee and won two Oscars for acting.  In the meantime, the French look down on us dirty Americans for having no taste.  Then again, they think Jerry Lewis is a genuis and Gerard Depardieu was once one of their biggest sex symbols.  'Nuff said.Enter at your own risk, just remember:  you have been warned.

$REVIEW.: When this film came out in 1992, much less had been documented and published about the German resistance to Hitler and the Nazis than is now known. It was, therefore, an important film in its time. And although the film now therefore feels somewhat dated, some of the interviews (filmed in the 1980s) are invaluable. The filmmaker, Hava Kohav Beller, interviewed 30 relatives and friends of resisters, and 5 actual resisters. An interview with a former German army officer, Axel von dem Bussche, was especially riveting for his description of an SS extermination squad in the Ukraine, and how this changed him.

this is one of my personal favorites along with "Mr

 the plus is the stunning transfer of the film to DVD

 It is fresh and few flaws are visible on this version

 I saw the new version of "Sunset Blvd." just after seeing this film, and though "Eve" was made the same year, it looks far cleaner and crisper than "Sunset" does

 Bravo to the restoration crew here! The film itself, is of course, a masterpiece and well worth the purchase price

$REVIEW.: Whenever I get into watching the Sopranos, I find myself thinking about them all the time, as if their lives were more real and vivid than my own. It astonishes me that characters whose experience is so different from my own, basically violent ill-educated thugs and their dames, can be given such humanity. I think the fascination comes from the contrast between the criminal underside of the Soprano family and the comfortable domesticity of their life in the suburbs, where (for example, in this season) they confront such ordinary problems as their daughter's first apartment and the tiny rift caused by the sophistication of her Columbia education.No episode exemplifies this dichotomy more than the shocking ninth episode "Whoever Did This" -- the episode that brings an end to the sordid career of the sociopathic Ralphie. I don't want to ruin this one for a viewer who has not watched the season, but suffice it to say that Tony's contradictions are here on full display; never is he more violent, or in a more sentimental cause. For sure, Tony is evil (Ralph's head in a bag proves it). But he's still human enough for us to believe that someone like Carmela and his children can legitimately love and care about him. What a trick these writers have!The fourth season is my favorite because it is the season where this tension between domestic comfort and violence is the most dramatic, and not only in the ninth episode. This is really Tony's and Carmela's season, as the secrets deepen and  their lives begin to veer apart hopelessly, the season when the tension becomes too much until it erupts when Carmela confronts Tony with evidence of his infidelity. Edie Falco is unbelievably good in that scene in the final episode "Whitecaps," and James Gandolfino ain't bad either.

$review_text.: The 138 episodes (all in B&W;) of the police drama "Naked City" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1958-1963.  The series started in a 30-minute format (39 episodes), took a year long break and return in a 60-minute format.  The series was filmed in the old Biograph Studios in the Bronx, famous as the studio where D.W. Griffith got his start.  Image Entertainment's 3 DVD release "Naked City - Set 3" contains an assortment of  twelve of the hour-long episodes from the last part of season 4.  The titles, episode numbers, and original air-dates are detailed below.Although the title makes it sound like a racy exploitation series it is actually the total opposite.  Many consider this gritty crime drama the best ever of its genre and the title reflects a focus on stripping away the glamour off NYC and exposing its ugly inside; at least to the extent that they could get away with on broadcast television during those years."Naked City" is a follow-up to the 1948 film noir feature of the same name.  Both movie and television series utilized extensive location shooting and they definitely have a different feel than the Hollywood product of that era.  Also unusual was featuring jazz music by Billy May and Nelson Riddle.The show never stopped changing its cast and was a bit like "Police Story" in this regard,  as it designed to showcase its many great guest stars (it drew a lot of big names from Broadway); and this variety was the show's greatest asset.Then again, what do I know?

$REVIEW.: If Season One of "Gargoyles" was all set-up, then Season Two is all payoff - and a lot more, as further characters are introduced, past mysteries are solved and further avenues are opened for exploration.In the first season (of which all fourteen episodes are available on DVD) a clan of Scottish gargoyles are betrayed and transformed into stone for a thousand years till they awaken in modern day Manhattan. Under the leadership of Goliath, they attempt to make sense of the modern world and adapt the gargoyle credo of protection to include all Manhattan.On the way the clan made several allies and enemies, predominantly police-detective Elisa Maza and the amoral millionaire David Xanatos, who is responsible for reawakening the gargoyles from their stone sleep. And now the story expands. I won't describe every single episode, as the series should be considered one whole, with characters, motivations and story-plots overlapping and intertwining into a clever and complex whole.The clan must deal with the Pack, a group of television stars-turned-criminal who consider hunting the gargoyles a prime sport and with Coldstone, a resurrected gargoyle who is at war with the three gargoyle souls trapped inside him: one beloved, one malevolent. Then there's Elisa's partner Matt Bluestone, a conspiracy-theorist who's on the trail of both the gargoyles and the Illuminati (a world-wide undercover organisation), Elisa's brother who works for Xanatos and may be in over his head when it comes to handling his new boss (and his Mutates) and Thailog, the evil-clone of Goliath.All these story-threads are dispersed throughout the season, mingled with character development and major/minor revelations. For instance, Xanatos has always been a fascinating character, and one of the most likeable "villain" you're ever likely to meet, but here he gets even more layers; when he expectedly finds himself more in love than he thought he was when his fianc&eacute;e Fox (an ex-member of the Pack) is endangered thanks to a dangerous engagement gift.Likewise, the tentative romance between Goliath and Elisa is growing, elderly gargoyle veteran Hudson addresses the problem of his illiteracy and the young trio - Brooklyn, Broadway and Lexington - continue to find their place in a world they must hide from.And of course, no "Gargoyles" review would be complete without mentioning Demona and Macbeth. Demona is another survivor of the Wyvern Massacre (and one of the individuals responsible for it in the first place) who has lived a tragic and lonely existence throughout a thousand years, during which she forged a mysterious link with the Scottish hero Macbeth (who is not quite the guy you remember from Shakespeare).  Macbeth has already made himself known to the gargoyles, declaring: "Know [Demona]? I named her!" whilst Demona herself is Goliath's past love, but proven herself to be the clan's sworn enemy due to her intense hatred of humanity. The secret to their immortality and their on-going feud is found within the truly epic four-parter "City of Stone", in which present-day Demona places a spell upon New York City, resulting in all human beings turning to stone at night. Seen through flashbacks we see the Wyvern Massacre from Demona's point of view, learn the reason behind Demona and Macbeth's love-hate relationship, the beginning of the Hunter legacy (who'll turn up again later) and meet the mysterious Weird Sisters who seem to have a particular interest in them...The Three Sisters will arise again in the "Avalon" trilogy, in which an old friend from the past emerges in Manhattan and whisks Goliath, Elisa and Bronx to the magical isle of Avalon. Through another series of flashbacks we discover what happens to the rookery eggs that also survived the Wyvern massacre, under the care of Princess Katharine, the Magus and the peasants Mary and Tom. Meanwhile, in the present day, Goliath finds the Avalon sanctuary under attack by several old enemies, and a surprise in store... It's a great trilogy which answers several questions and adds much to the "Gargoyles" tapestry (and anyone who knows anything about Arthurian legend can guess who else pops up there).Two other particularly note-worthy episodes are "Vows", which manages to pack in a wedding, a time-travelling adventure, a talisman known as the Phoenix Gate and the poignant end to Goliath's love for Demona. Second is the brilliant episode known as "The Mirror", in which Demona steals a magical mirror and summons forth Puck (yes, another Shakespeare reference), who we have not met before...or have we? With this mischievous fey in tow, Demona wrecks havoc over the city - though its not always to even her liking.The DVD ends just as Goliath, Elisa and Bronx are sent off in what became known to fans as the "Avalon World Tour", in which they learn that they may not be as alone in the world as they thought they were...The release of the next lot of episodes on DVD relies on the good sales of this one. The fans will no doubt help move a large chunk, but if you are a newcomer to the "Gargoyles" series then allow me to make a huge recommendation. "Gargoyles" is as accessible as much to adults as it is to children - in some cases even more so. The deep character development, the intricate stories, the foreshadowing and continuation of even the smallest details, the superb voice casting, the references borrowed from Shakespeare and folklore...it's all here in a thoroughly entertaining, intelligent and enlightening show.

And if the third movie features The Rhino from the end of this movie, I will not be seeing it.  That character as it appeared briefly at the end of this movie was horrendous.  From now on I want in on the script or I'm not going to see the movie.  In fact, not just the script, everything must pass my approval.  I'm waiting... call me.

$REVIEW.: This BBC adaption of Mansfield Park faithfully follows Jane Austen's story of a quiet heroine who overcomes the odds to marry the man who has captured her heart.  Fanny Price must be a sore trial for an actress, for most scenes she must sit silent or speak just a few words.  Her body language is likewise restrained.  In this version we have a lovable Fanny who signals expressively with her eyes, indicating a depth of emotion and anguish that captures the heart.  She is supported by an able ensemble cast who are all flawless in their roles from the amiable Edmund Bertram to the evil Henry Crawford.In Mansfield Park, Jane Austen turns her caustic eye on the situation of the "poor relation".  Fanny Price is the daughter of a gently born lady who married a naval officer, now sunk by alcoholism and injury to a life on shore in Portsmouth.  Fanny's mother has two sisters: Mrs. Norris who married a clergyman and Lady Bertram, wife to Sir Thomas.  These two wind up off-handedly bringing Fanny to Mansfield Park as a child where the main object is to impress upon her how inferior her status is to her cousins and how grateful she should be.  Because of this dark undertone, there is less humor in the situation, but by the same token, Fanny's eventual triumph is much larger.If you want stars and glamor, go elsewhere, but for the money this is the best and most faithful rendering of Jane Austen's observant novel.

It seems that an odd movie is all you can make of this subculture.Meryl Streep in luminous, as usual and Nicholas cage pulls off a self-conscious screenwriter with bad hair, but it was Chris Cooper who blew me away with his Oscar winning performance of John Laroche.  That alone, was worth the price of admission.The ending got a bit out of hand, but by the time we get there, we realize that it fits perfectly onto this wacky, brilliant movie.

$REVIEW.: "Hackers", from 1995, is one of the weirder entries in the canon of hacker movies. Maybe that's why is has cult status in spite of not being very good. Dade Murphy (Johnny Lee Miller) has moved with his mother to New York City for his senior year of high school. Still on probation for a computer virus he unleashed when he was only 11 years old, Dade sneaks online to hack. At school, he immediately enters into a battle of wills with a comely hacker named Kate (Angelina Jolie) and begins to hang out with the hacker crowd. The newbie in the gang, Joey (Jesse Bradford), downloads a mysterious file from the computer system of Ellington Mineral, an oil company. He is arrested soon after, but not before passing the file on. The gang soon find themselves blamed for a destructive virus and in a race against time to unravel an embezzlement plot.The nice thing about hacker movies is that they tend to be clever in their own way even when they are bad. I've really no idea why characters in "Hackers" are so often seen rollerblading. They just skate around for no reason, like in "Xanadu". I've never seen a hackerspace that looks like an underground dance club with a giant video game screen, funky lighting that you can't see by, and lots of space to rollerblade. Computers in 1995 were not that fast or graphics that cool. There is no attempt to appear socially or technologically realistic. But "Hackers" exploits a number of hacker memes, and it's not afraid to make fun of itself. Joey's defense lawyer wants to claim he's "addicted" to computers, a common accusation, and defense, of hackers at the time. We see him in a 12-step program. It makes fun of the doomsday hacker hysteria spewed by law enforcement as well.Interestingly, Ellington Mineral's nefarious security expert (Fisher Stevens) tries to manipulate Dade by appealing to the hacker's ego, referring to hackers as "samurai" and "keyboard cowboys". It is almost warning the audience against falling for such flattery and self-importance. On the goofy side, these characters dress like a circus sideshow. They seem to have been selected by a bean-counter. There is a Hispanic hacker, a black hacker, a female hacker, and three white guys, one so odd that his very appearance elicits laughter -and incredulity. In a deft product placement, one of the hackers is called "Lord Nikon". There are also a Nikon camera and logo in the film, but I've never seen a character named after a product before. A hacking duel between Dade and Kate takes on real world proportions, as a kind of foreplay, because Kate is female. Perhaps the dream of many young male hackers. This was Angelina Jolie when she had chipmunk cheeks and a button nose, which is surprising in itself. It's not a good movie, but "Hackers" is fast-paced and funny.The DVD (MGM 1998): There is a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min). Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing is available in French.

$review_text.: "The Crush" is not a fantastic movie; it is a good movie that you can watch on a Friday night if you haven't anything else to watch
If your a fan of films that feature deranged women boardering on the line of insanity "The Crush" is for you
Alicia Silverstone plays a 14 year old obsessed by an older man, played by British cutie Cary Elwes (famous for his role in the first "Saw" film)
When the older man doesn't return the same feelings that the young girl inhabits for him, all hell breaks out for him and those around him including his girlfriend


"The Crush" is very similar in theme to movies like "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle", "Misery", and "Fatal Attraction", that feature beautiful women wanting to wreak vengence on those around them for one reason or another


I enjoyed the film since I love female villin films
For Cary Elwes fans there's a hot shower scene featuring his back side as well


The DVD of the movie is pretty much barebones, but the film is in widescreen, subtitles are in English, French, and Spanish, and there are cast filmographies.

 The characters are all very likeable and the movie has no sex or profanity

 There is very little violence and it is relatively mild


 This movie is very comparable to "Raiders of the Lost Ark" in the sense that it is a movie that everyone in the family can not only watch together, but also enjoy together.The DVD also has some nice special features, including a game you have to play in order to get to all of the menu items


 I didn't like having to jump through all the hoops, so I have yet to see all the available menus, but the features I did see were good

 This is probably the best movie for the whole family I've seen in a couple of years.

$review_text.: This is a good movie to watch during the wee hours of the morning, when  nobody is around to pester you and you're in the mood for some thrills and  chills.  Stir of Echoes has plenty of them.  The movie starts off with the  kid taking a bath.  His father, Tom (Kevin Bacon), is talking to him from  the bedroom.  But the boy is clearly talking to somebody else.  The camera  angles around when he is whisked out of the tub.  Nobody is there.Tom takes  his wife and goes across the street to join a party, where his  sister-in-law hypnotizes him.  The special effects in that scene were very  good.  I won't spoil them for you.  After he comes out the trance and goes  home, thinking he can sleep off the weird experience.But then the ghost of  Samantha, who disappeared about a year before, starts haunting him.  The  movie really takes off from there, catapulting Tom and his family into a  surreal and scary nightmare, where he can see ghosts and foretell the  future of his neighbors.  Samantha continues to haunt him until he is  forced to find out what happened to her.  The ending was typical of  Hollywood, but I was still satisfied.Stir of Echoes is based on the novel  that was written by Richard Mattheson during the 1950s.  Koepp had to  change the plot quite a bit to modernize it to the 90s, but he did a good  job.  The story was still virtually the same.  A ordinary man finds himself  in a strange world he doesn't understand, has to solve a mystery he doesn't  want to be a part of, and live to tell about it.

Sounds like the perfect Friday nights entertainment doesn't it? Well, it is for these guys.To be sure, 'The Gamers' is an amateur film comprised of amateur actors. In fact the cast is most likely comprised of real gamers playing themselves. Despite the lack of professional know how this film really works and is lots of fun for fantasy game players or those who just want to see a humorous depiction of what role playing is all about.How do you rate a movie such as this? Well the usual rules don't apply. I judge it by it's uniqueness and wonderful nerd factor which in this particular case is a good thing!

$review_text.: For the past two years, the Universal Legacy Collection has put out some of the greatest movies on DVD. Among the valued treasures are those that belong in the genre of classic horror. Please, if you want to enjoy a small, though significant, part of the Legacy, then purchase and watch the Creature from the Black Lagoon trilogy. You will be entertained from a variety of perspectives.For instance, one can easily derive campy humor from one scene to the next, especially with the sometimes cheesy special effects that accompany the recurring asinine dialogue throughout. As a case in point, there is a moment in Revenge of the Creature, where after a young college student is grabbed by the Creature and is thrown in midair, the student's body dips about six inches before briefly defying gravity only to rise and suddenly crash into a tree headfirst and die. Though I, myself, cannot recall seeing this kind of flaw in any other movie, there are other scenes prevalent that would give a whole new meaning to the somewhat nowadays obsolete term, trick photography.Along with the humor and the sometimes hilarious visual phenomena, the attempt at a science fiction storyline is also a delight, though laughable from the standpoint of a marine or evolutionary biologist. However, the mere idea of creating a missing link between fish and man did, after all, spawn at least these three motion pictures. The Creature was, in sum, one of the very few onscreen entities that could either permanently live on land or underwater (at least in the first two motion pictures, where it still had both lungs and gills).All in all, one will not have to look hard to understand or enjoy the plots or sequences to fully enjoy this DVD collection. Though none of the motion pictures is an outright masterpiece or fully epitomizes the presentation of what is suited for a thinking person, the Creature from the Black Lagoon Legacy Collection is, nevertheless, an altogether fun kind of packaging that one will repeatedly watch, especially when it is time to entertain kids who want to see monster movies during Halloween.

$REVIEW.: "Sometimes the green mile seems so long," an aged Paul Edgecomb laments at the film's end. I would have to say that this aptly describes my sentiments during some of the drawn-out stretches of this movie. However, besides it's length, The Green Mile is an otherwise extremely laudable work, displaying the best of cast and crew alike.  Though the screenplay was written and directed by Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption), The Green Mile is distinctly Stephen King, the story's author. This means you can expect a sharp plot line, emotionally tumultuous scenes, and novel characters so vivid that each is a story in itself. It goes without saying then, that the screenplay was a very true adaptation of the 6-part novel by King, the most accurate of any King work.The film begins in the modern day with an old Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer from Little House) accounting his past as a prison guard on the "green mile," the colorful name given to death row at Coal Mountain Prison in Louisiana. Though the movie has a slow start (which didn't particularly bother me - it's well-suited for the film), we quickly find ourselves in the mid-depression south, 1935, where the main story takes place.John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a gargantuan black man with a child's mind, is arrested for a crime  too deplorable to mention.  He finds himself on Cell Block-E, headed by Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), awaiting electrocution by "Old Sparky," the name given to the electric chair. (Yes, in a King story even inanimate objects are memorable characters.)Edgecomb quickly realizes that Coffey's nature doesn't match the heinousness of the crime he is accused of. What ensues is the relationship that develops between Edgecomb and Coffey, who seems to have an extraordinary gift - the power of healing. He starts with Edgecomb himself, healing his painful urinary tract infection, and then moves on to Mr. Jingles, the film's little mascot, a mouse that takes a liking to one of the inmates. Mice? Supernatural? Don't fret. Darabont successfully interlaces these seemingly unbelievable scenes so as to make them almost unnoticeable.What is less than subtle are the parallels between John Coffey and another famous J.C. from history, but this is typical of King's and Darabont's work together (Shawshank certainly had its spiritually metaphorical moments).There are two kinds of King movies, the sick-beyond-sick films (such as Pet Sematary), and the more dramatic, Oscar-type efforts (Stand By Me, Shawshank). Though of the latter breed, you'll still get a taste of the trademark disturbed King in the Mile - specifically in a 3-minute death scene, an execution in Old Sparky that goes nightmarishly wrong. (Not for the faint of heart.) The entire sequence is set off by the childish prison guard Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) who does as good a job as any antagonist ever at making us hate him. In fact, by the end of this movie you'll find yourself wishing for a fate worse than death for the little brat. (Be patient.) All-in-all the chemistry between the prison guards (Hanks, David Morse, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey DeMunn) is admirable as well as believable. This camaraderie culminates in their plan to sneak J.C. out of his cell for a special healing. This is the one incident I would call "a little too much" in terms of plot. Something more believable could've been used to accomplish the same plot purposes.  The positives are plentiful. For one, we now have a new star, Michael Clarke Duncan. He gave an emotional (though at times a little over-done) portrayal of Coffey; you'll fall in love with him from the get-go. Though there isn't a weak casting choice (hats off to Mali Finn), Duncan dominates the movie with his loveable character.The characters are as only King could conjure. Even in the few brief cameo moments we have with Gary Sinise we feel as though we have known him and his family for years. Also distinctly King? Mr. Jingles, the amiable mouse that frequents the green mile. Who else could successfully weave a mouse into an otherwise somber prison movie?Less than extraordinary are the bookmark present-day scenes, bracketing the beginning and ending of the movie. We see this in all the latest epics, don't we? Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, etc. It's overdone. Though it's far less annoying in the Mile than in Titanic, I found these flash-forwards to be even more unnecessary. They serve no discernable purpose. It could have been worse, however, since Darabont wisely wrote out a character from the modern-day segment, an orderly that was harassing the old Edgecomb (included as a typological Percy in King's original work).And finally, the one element missing that could have made this film that much more memorable would have been good music. Thomas Newman (American Beauty, Erin Brockovich) did not produce a score worthy of the cinematography. Zimmer or Horner would have been far superior options.Final word? Don't miss the Mile. It's an emotionally charged movie that may even be a little underdone (in a positive sense), something very rare in today's over-the-top flicks. But be prepared for a long sit and a few tears. The Mile hits you where it hurts, in seeing injustice done to the bearer of truth. Of course you'll also see the best side of Stephen King, and we, like Paul Edgecomb, will see that miracles can happen anywhere.

$REVIEW.: This WWII is a sleeper WWII Classic because it shows us the RARE EASTERN FRONT battle line.  This film depicts the turning point of the German invasion of Russia with the demoralized Russian Army making a last stand at &quot;STALINGRAD&quot;.Based on factual events the story really is about two men who are sent out to win for their countries this decisive physcological battle.  A (based on a real Russian hero) Russian shepherd / hunting sharpshooter Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law) turned sniper has the edge by becoming a political &amp; the peoples hero versus a Germany's #1 Marksman Major Konig (Ed Harris) who is sent to kill this Russian sniper hero.  The movie is a cat &amp; mouse game between these two experts with both countries depending on their respective man to win.  Mean while the &quot;Battle of Stalingrad&quot; continues.This Widescreen DVD captures the dissmal &amp; gruesome conditions of this wore torn Russian city &amp; its Army.  Well Directed and acted this movie is a great addition to your WWII DVD library.
$SUMMARY.: Rare Hollywood WWII film about Russian sniper hero !

$review_text.: Theodore Roosevelt--lover of the limelight, ambitious to the extreme at times, pain in the rear for anyone who got in his way or opposed him--externally, this man doesn't seem like much of an American icon.  Yet icon he is, for he stands for everything the ideal American should: Ambition, the drive to do what it takes to accomplish your dreams, the courage to stand up to the bully (in his case, big business) who no one else will stand up to.  Call him what you will, Roosevelt was an incredible man.This documentary is beautifully done.  Richard Dreyfuss is perfect as the voice of Teddy--I couldn't imagine a better match.  Clips of video, photographs, and splendid views of gorgeous scenery make this documentary pleasing to the eye, and superb editing and dubbing, coupled with relevant commentary and quotes from Teddy himself make it enjoyable to listen to as well.  These features combine to make Teddy a REAL person, with insecurities and fears to match his ambitions and acheivements, and serve to endear him to almost any viewer.I have studied almost nothing on Theodore Roosevelt, so I can't really comment on how accurate this is.  It is possible (it wouldn't be the first time) that the History Channel is a little hazy on some of the facts, but for all I know this film is accurate.  This is definitely one of the best new documentaries I have seen in a long time.

$REVIEW.: Let me get to the point. I am a very serious DVD collector. I have over 2,000 DVDs in my collection at present. I try my hardest to watch each and every DVD that I buy. I must admit that "Copying Beethoven" was one of those DVDs that did not get my interest even though I had bought it. After I bought it, the DVD sat on my shelf for about two years. I watched the other DVDs and passed on "Copying Beethoven" time and time again. Finally, finally I said to myself I need to watch it and decide if I wanted to keep it or sell it. I was stunned by the magnificent acting, photography of this unexpected gem. I'm not a favorite of classic music but I was mesmerized by this production. It was one of those unexpected surprises. I truly enjoyed this delight. Ed Harris and Diane Kruger were marvelous in their roles.Treat yourself to this movie!

$REVIEW.: Like to say I haven't seen the movie but I love to hear it once it's out on DVD pretty soon. Yep this movie talks about the basic story of basketball coach Ken Carter (excuse me did I got that right?) who's trying to teach or keep those kids from running away from school and be a person of somebody. He's trying to tell all the details of what to be a good basketball player but not a fake player. I think everybody should see this 'cuz it has Ashanti in it (whom it's her first acting role in the movie). I'm still a big fan to her and hopefully that I'll cop her album right after the movie's out or what. Anyway give it an A.

$review_text.: Rey Mysterio vs Kane in a No Holds Barred Match: Kane dominates a little but Rey reverses the Choke Slam into his 6:19 splash move to win the match.Evan Bourne vs Matt Hardy: This was one of the best matches of the night with many reversals and near pin falls. End comes when Evan reverses the Twist of Fate into a pin, Hardy kicks out and hits the Twist of Fate right after for the win.Santino vs Honkey Tonk Man: The 3 Legends look like they got in shape for the match but it was still a waste. Santino is entertaining but still no way should he have a long title reign. It was hardly a mtch because Beth Phoenix tripped Honkey Tonk not long into the match to cause a DQ. Then Piper and Goldust came out to get a piece of Santino. Meanwhile C.M Punk didn't even have a match and the Shelton Benjaman match didn't even air on the PPV! Benjaman beat R. Truth though with his finisher.Cryme Time vs John Morrison and The MiZ: That's right, fans actually voted for this over a tag team title match. The same thing happened that has always happens when the 2 teams have wrestled, Miz and Morrison won.Big Show vs Undertaker in a Last Man Standing Match: Big Show dominated a lot of the match and could have easily have won if the ref didn't pause in between each number while counting. One time it was clear that Taker didn't even make the count but the ref stood over him waiting for him to fully stand. End comes when Taker knocks out Show with that choke hold of his to win the match.Hardy vs HHH: Hardy really deserves to be champ. He took HHH to the limit once again and this was even a better match than their last. I think HHH is just on Smackdown though so he can beat Undertaker at WM. Beating Flair's title reign record and ending Taker's streak at WM would be impressive he wasn't just pushing himself. Anyway end comes when HHH stops Hardy from going high risk and hits the Pedigree.Batista vs Jericho with Stone Cold as the ref: This match wasn't a worthy main event to an otherwise really good ppv. Jericho jobbed on Raw the last few weeks, so I was really hoping he'd win this match. He took out Batista's legs a lot, hit him with the belt and JBL even made a run in but boring Batista still won.It's just because dumb Cena is coming back so they can wrestle again. Jericho deserved a longer reign though. If he was going to lose it, should have been to HBK. He hasn't even been champ that many times. No way, should guys like Batista and Cena be champ more than HBK. Hell I wish that even C.M punk was in this match over Batista, he hasn't even had a match at a PPV 3 in a row. If anyone was going to be a new champ tonight, should have been someone with actual talent, like Bourne or Jeff Hardy.

Intelligent, witty, articulate, interesting cases that you won't see on every other law or forensic program. Most of all you have to love the WIT-----and underneath it all, the finely drawn characters make you love them, whether you approve of a particular action on their part or not. There is an element of sorrow in both "Denny" and Alan"----yet you can laugh and really enjoy their wicked ways without guilt. This is a quality show and I wish it were still on the air.I am left with collecting all the seasons in order to enjoy these shows again whenever I feel withdrawal coming on.If you have never seen it, check your listings---no luck there? Then BUY season one and get hooked.

$REVIEW.: ***Spoiler Warning***Dreadful. Now that's a word I don't hear or use very often. But dang, it's the most appropriate term for this silly train wreck of a flick.Admittedly, I'm not a fan of auteur director Tim Burton. But this, this would be bad regardless of whatever name was attached to it. Had he adopted a pseudonym like say, John Smith, I would be here saying that Director Smith had pooped out a turd and called it a movie.Not sure if Hollywood has yet figured out that Burton's visionary talent is monochromatic astigmatism with a dash of delusional creativity. Like a street performer - while initially fascinating and providing a momentary diversion, quickly loses steam as one gets bored by the repetitive drone. You've seen it all before. The man is the definition of a one-string banjo with a bucket of white face paint and mobile airbrush on the side.Depp's vampire-outside-his-own-time bit quickly grows tiresome and honestly doesn't make the best use of the material. There were a multitude of lost opportunities as Burton went for the cheap easy laughs, failing to exploit anachronisms to their maximum potential. Sadly, there were only a few moments of pure cleverness. One of the best as Barnabus makes a quiet sideways inquiry on meeting the young Collins daughter Carolyn for the first time, to which she replies in a wonderful deadpan, "I think he called me a hooker." Unfortunate that there weren't more of those.The one performance I found enjoyable - Eva Green. To me, she struck the right balance of zesty campiness, sincere wickedness and forlorn love warped into vicious jealousy. Previously she's always taken the quiet, often low-key approach to her characterizations. But as witch Angelique, the funny comedienne emerged from her more established cool sensual persona. Fun and tasty, I like to think this role will broaden her appeal to differing filmmakers.The worst aspect of this production was that the entire film lacked cohesiveness. Various components patched together with no sense of a greater theme; scenes and cast that were disconnected and unfinished.Examples of script incongruity:- Victoria states she was always returning to Collinswood and back to Barnabas. When does she "always return" to the township? It's never explained. And that when she returns, it's always to him. Wasn't he stuck in a coffin all her life? So... &lt;shrug>- Another quagmire: How many ghosts inhabit the manor? Two apparently. There's the original Josette who haunts her modern incarnation Victoria. Then suddenly, and conveniently without any explanation, young David's mother appears in a pathetic deus ex machina cheat to save the day. Confusingly, neither interacts with the other. 'Natch, since we're only introduced to the other spirit toward the very end of the film.- Carolyn's lycanthropy. No seeming point to this other than as a hurried prop thrown into this weak monster bash. All that was missing was ol' Bolt Neck.Stuff like this irks since we're left trying to make sense out of the senseless; pressed to make our own mental jigsaw by forcing the various pieces to fit.Lack of directorial oversight and ignoring simple internal story logic.Mostly, I feel bad for the hardcore Dark Shadows fans. Can't begin to imagine their disappointment, frustration and anger. And in truth, if I were part of any iconic cultural heritage, and the name Tim Burton was suddenly mentioned in conversation, I'd be very, very scared. The man has the unfortunate black thumb of moviemakers looking to plumb the cultural bank. Planet Of The Apes, Mars Attacks, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory - the list of smoking craters and salted fields goes on and on.Honestly, you're better off watching the 'The Addams Family' reboots or kicking back with 'Hocus Pocus'.

$REVIEW.: This is the best movie in years! The fan base is strong on this opinion. It is the first and only time I can recall where the critics and theater owners were so wrong that it is still debated how bad their reviews and decisions were.When it came out to the theaters many patrons were shocked that it was not more like Star Wars. It does have Harrison Ford and Star Wars was still the new yard stick for being a film of the sci fi genre. Directed by Ridley Scott (Alien) it was slammed by the critics and public so much that it was yanked from theaters quickly.The film did get to the public when released on video years ago and has been going strong ever since. It is the film that would not go away. Retrospectives and internet dicussions are still giving this film endless reavaluatios and critisism.This version is excellent the transfers are very clean with no visible defects and sound is some of the best I have ever heard.If you have never seen this film I recommend it just for the visual style and wonderful noir atmosphere created for this future Earth. Those that love sci fi must take a look just to see what all the talk is about.

At least in seasons 1 and 2 I could still play them on my computer, but season 3 Disc 1 side 1, last episode (I believe it is "Someone to Trust") would not play on either of my DVD players nor my computer.

$review_text.: Nana: My grandmother, Anne GillisTHE ROAD TO THE RICHARD DONNER CUT:Starting in 1977, director Richard Donner filmed SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE and SUPERMAN II simultaneously. In order to make the deadline for SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, at some point in production it was decided to postpone filming the remaining scenes needed for SUPERMAN II until after SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE was finished.However, between 50% and 80% of SUPERMAN II was already filmed by Richard Donner before he was replaced/fired by the Salkinds, the producers / financiers of the films.And although all of his scenes had already been filed, Marlon Brando's footage as Superman's father, Jor-El, was to be cut from SUPERMAN II due to his litigation with the Salkinds and Warners.Richard Lester took over as director for SUPERMAN II, continuing filming in July 1979. Lester actually re-shot several scenes already lensed by Donner. Donner has suggested this was a move by the Salkinds to deny Donner a director's credit; other have suggested that in order for Richard Lester to earn a directorial credit on the film, SUPERMAN II had to contain at least 51% of his footage, necessitating rewrites and reshoots.SUPERMAN II, directed by Richard Lester and released in the US in 1981 (overseas in 1980), contained at least 30% (probably more) footage shot by Richard Donner. Although few people knew it at the time, the released version of SUPERMAN II was drastically different than what Donner originally intended. In fact, it was a completely different film than much of what had originally been filmed for SUPERMAN II.Nevertheless, SUPERMAN II was a box office hit, a critical success, an instant classic and a cherished memory for my generation and the next. I loved the film; have seen it dozens (if not over 100) times and it will always hold a very special place in my heart.But for almost a decade, as the Internet and Web grew, Superman fans were lobbying to see a Richard Donner Cut of S2; including ALL of the footage he (not Lester) shot. Specifically, they wanted to see Donner's original footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, as well as the different scenes that had been replaced / re-shot by Lester. They wanted to see Donner's vision, Donner's intended "companion piece" to SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE (STM).In 2006, that campaign paid off as Warner Brothers authorized the cut. Over nine months, editor Michael Thau located, restored, cleaned up and assembled the Donner S2 footage - six tons of it --- into a very different version of SUPERMAN II. Using the 1977 SUPERMAN II script penned by Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz (who, uncredited, also penned the screenplay for STM), Thau re-edited the film, and added several newly-filmed shots with CGI enhancements.Thau did a commendable job creating a "new" film version of S2 as close to Donner's original vision as possible some 25 years later. The film still included Lester footage, but had a decidedly different feeling and was very much a new film, much more in tone with the first Superman film, much more of a true "part two" to the original film. Over 50% of the RDC was footage never before seen.Part of my difficulty with reviewing the Richard Donner Cut of SUPERMAN II is that I know the original Lester-directed S2 so well (OK, I can quote the entire movie) that comparison is inevitable and unavoidable, and in some cases I balk when I see how different some scenes are. Some scenes feel "wrong" only because I am used to seeing them presented in the Lester S2 way. I had that knee-jerk reaction several times - hey, that's not the next scene! Where's the Eiffel Towel sequence? Where's the jump into Niagara's Great Gorge? Where's, "General, would you care to step outside?"Getting past that, the RDC is a very good - but not great - film. There's a lot to like, there's a lot to love, but there are also some parts to dislike and some questionable choices.After 25 years, it's unfair to say which film is "better" because we've known the Lester cut of S2 since 1981, and it was professionally polished, scored and finished, whereas the RDC is still, in some ways, a fan edit, complete with questionable editing choices in places, pacing issues, and poor music choices in other scenes. Despite being a finished product, there is a somewhat "unfinished" and "rushed" quality to it. And it can certainly be argued that most of the flaws in the RDC can be attributed to the fact that it wasn't finished in the first place.All that said, S2: The Richard Donner Cut is a treasure and Michael Thau has pulled the proverbial rabbit out of his hat and given Superman fans a true Christmas present. Considering the age (and disorganization) of the original footage, that Thau could produce a coherent, nearly complete Donner cut is a hell of an achievement that should not be understated. On the whole, his effort paid off handsomely. And he clearly put a lot of thought (and dare I say, love) into his efforts.There is so much about the RDC that is far superior to the Lester version of S2 -- the interaction between Margot Kiddor and Christopher Reeve seems so much more natural and fun, and anything with Brando as Jor-El is better than what Lester re-shot. The fact that these Brando scenes were ever cut is a crime. Brando makes this movie, and among other things, the inclusion of the Brando footage gives real weight and emotion to certain key scenes, and even finally answers exactly how Superman gets his powers back at the Fortress of Solitude.Yes, the RDC is a mixed bag, and as one reviewer said, "It is the ultimate deleted scene." But it's much more than that. It's the answer to a wish, a look into what could have been, and like most wishes, both good things and not so good things occur when a wish is granted.On that note, let's discuss specifics.THE GOOD (AND THE GREAT):The film is dedicated in loving memory of Christopher Reeve. In the audio commentary, Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz speak so fondly of Reeve. Very appropriate, very touching.I thought Donner's thank you video to the fans at the top of the film was very classy.As the villains break free from the Phantom Zone; Zod shouts, "Freeeeeeeee!" and the credits roll. Powerful! Scary! Throughout the entire RDC, the villains are much more serious, much more menacing. There is real danger here. All of the Lester slapstick and nonsense has been removed. The "cute" villain moments are gone. I'm amazed how such subtle editing changed the Zoners from campy to deadly.After the credits, the film opens with the New York skyline and a new image of the World Trade Center. It's a little jarring to see the WTC in a "new" film post September 11, but the twin tower's construction was completed in 1973, just four years before Superman was filmed. No effort was made to remove the WTC from the film, and I am grateful for that. Whether it's the Lester cut or Donner cut, visually SUPERMAN II is clearly a period piece set in the late 1970s and to remove the iconic WTC would be wrong.In a many of the scenes we have previously viewed, Thau uses different angles of the same take. Nice touch and adds to the "new film" feeling.The new opening at the Daily Planet in which Lois sees Clark's resemblance to Superman - fantastic. Reeve and Kidder look like they had so much fun filming this scene--it's playful, immediately shows Lois Lane is nobody's fool, and demonstrates how well Reeve played Clark Kent. Donner's direction really shows here.The additional banter between Lex and Eve is hilarious. Lex's comment that you never use the words "Lex and Wrong" in the same sentence is great. Some of their scenes go on a little too long, but usually they're worth it.Every scene with Brando as Jor-El is better than the Lester scene where he was replaced, although Susannah York DID do a great job in the Lester version of S2. Having Brando back as Jor-El adds such strong (and needed) continuity to the first film.Superman's identity revealed: Even though it's two different screen tests and Chris Reeve is probably 20 pounds lighter and made up differently in one half of it, the merged Donner scene in which Lois fires the gun at Clark, who is forced to reveal his true identity, is excellent. After Clark removes his glasses and admonishes Lois that had she been wrong, Clark Kent would be dead, Lois deadpans, "With a blank?" and then she smiles. "Gotcha." Brilliant writing and execution.However: Although this Donner scene is superior to the Lester revelation scene where Clark trips over the pink polyester bear rug, one crucial aspect the Donner screen test lacks is the follow-up between Clark and Lois. In the Lester version, after Clark has tripped and fallen and plunged his hand into the fireplace, his glasses come off and Lois yelps, "Clark! Let me look at it!" Clark fumbles to put his glasses back on and hide his uninjured hand but Lois can see he's not burned at all. It's an emotional scene, well acted, and tender.I miss that beautiful scene. Despite the setting - a garish polyester honeymoon suite - the acting is intense, sincere, and some of Kidder and Reeve's best work in the series and a triumph for Lester. It's a shame some sort of meld of the Donner scene with this Lester scene wasn't possible, but it would be too jarring.When the villains arrive in Midwestern America, the removal of the Lester lame humor and sight gags is very welcome, improves the movie dramatically, and gives the villains a FAR more menacing quality.The exchange where Jor-El warns Superman of the dangers of falling in love is powerful. This scene's exclusion in the original S2 is inexcusable and wrong. Brando is brilliant here. He is PLEADING with his son not to give up his powers.Think, Kal-El! I beg you! Think!And when Jor-El ask him, "Is this how you repay their gratitude? By abandoning the weak, the defenseless, the needy - for the sake of your selfish pursuits?" I loved Superman's incredulous, "Selfish, after all I've done for them? At least they have a chance for happiness! I only ask the same, nothing more." is excellent. And there's Lois, after making love to Superman, wearing only Superman's shirt and socks, watching. As Superman's powers are destroyed, Jor-El just stares at her hatefully- and she backs up, terrified. Love it.Great addition: General Zod smiling as he shoots people with the machine gun. Really shows how evil he is.Now we come to the money scene--A powerless and bruised Superman arrives at the Fortress of Solitude. (Only gripe--Lester's choice to darken the fortress a deep, gloomy green is much more effective than Donner's choice to keep the Fortress all lit up. In the Lester version, the fortress is dark green, cold and dead. Visually it made more sense.)That quibble aside, this is THE scene we have waited to see, and it was SO worth the wait. Jor-El appears, speaks to Superman, and dies in order to restore his son's powers.Superman: "Father... I failed, I failed you, I failed myself and all humanity. I traded my birthright for a life of submission in a world that is now ruled by your enemies. There's no one left to help them now, the people of the world, not since I... FATHER!"The Green crystal glows... He picks it up, inserts it into the control panel... He's shivering...Jor-El: "Listen carefully, my son, for we shall never speak again. If you hear me now, then you have made use of the only means left to you - the crystal source through which our communication was begun. The circle is now complete. You have made a dreadful mistake, Kal-El. You have abandoned the world for the sake of private ambition. You did this of your own free will, and in spite of all I could say to dissuade you. Now you have returned here to me for one last chance to redeem yourself. This too - finally - I have anticipated, my son. (pause) Look at me, Kal-El... Once before, when you were small, I died while giving you a chance for life. And now, even though it will exhaust the final energy left within me... Look at me, Kal-El!... The Kryptonian prophecy will be at last fulfilled. The son becomes the father - the father becomes the son. Goodbye forever, Kal-El. Remember me, my son..."And Jor-El appears in corporeal form and lays his hand on Superman's shoulder, as Superman shudders and white light engulfs him.IN-CRED-IBLE. This is the CORE of the father-son relationship theme of both films. The acting is compelling, poetic, and strong.HOW COULD THEY CUT THIS SCENE IN THE LESTER VERSION?Back in Metropolis...The battle has started! Great moment: Jimmy re-entering the office with Perry's coffee and Lex steals it out of his hand. Jimmy argues that the coffee was the Chief's and Lex counters calmly that, "The Chief's got it."I loved the new edits -- during the battle over Metropolis, the focus in on what's going on at the Daily Planet, especially with Jimmy, Lois and Perry--not on stupid sight gags and goofy slapstick humor, or people we don't care about (like Luanne).The battle over Metropolis, with a few exceptions, is pretty much the same, mostly Richard Lester footage and very good. Glad to see the slapstick (such as the guy on the phone continuing the conversation after his phone booth is knocked over and blown away) have been removed. This Lester-filmed battle was always VERY good, and Donner's inclusions of the few battle shots he filmed (such as Superman hitting and destroying the Statue's of Liberty's torch) is very cool.The final confrontation at the Fortress is far better than the Lester version. No silly "ray-beam" or "invisible" powers, no ripping the S-shield into a piece of cellophane. We just have Zod tell Superman, very matter-of-factly: "Your father once condemned us to eternal living death. Your fate shall be the same. You will live, Kal-El. Forever - as my slave. If not, then others will pay for your stubborn attitude. Innocent people, millions of them if necessary --- Beginning with her." and he nods to Lois.And in this edit of the film, that's all it takes, Given everything we've seen, we KNOW Zod will literally destroy the world to get his way. He's THAT dangerous.Impressive.After the final battle, Superman destroys the fortress and he and Lois end their relationship:SUPERMAN: "Look, Lois, I..."LOIS: (brave smile) "Hey. No... regrets, you know? I mean I did it, didn't I? I got the man I love to love me?"SUPERMAN: (Sincerely) "Oh, yeah."LOIS: "So okay, then. So they need you too. I'd be buying my personal little rainbow at the cost of all those people who say, "Help, come quick ... you think I don't understand that? It's the old eternal triangle, right? Except in my case I've got all of humanity in the next bedroom."SUPERMAN: "We'll see each other. All the time, like before. But it can't be like..."LOIS kisses him passionately. He responds in spite of himself. They break. She looks up at him, trembling.LOIS: "Just don't forget, that's all."Poetic, beautifully written and acted. Powerful. Poignant.Finally, the new wrap-up at the Daily Planet is very sweet, really showing the fondness Lois has for Clark, and I liked his offer to pay for the pizza. Just a sweet scene.Now we move on to the ... NOT SO GOOD:Many of my complaints about the RDC have already echoed by reviewers nationwide. The recap of the events in STM is just too long--well over five minutes. Lester's recap in S2 - with the credits interweaved with the relevant events of the first movie - worked much better even though it ran in about the same time.Bathroom humor. Why? Why in the world restore the god-awful bathroom humor? In prison, "Slasher Folgelstein is a bed-wetter." "Did you go pssht?" "Why didn't you go before we left?" And the absolute worst - a toilet flushing sound in the fortress of solitude. It's beyond juvenile - it's painful.The Music - Thau elected to reuse the John Williams score from the first film rather than the Ken Thorne composition of the Williams music from S2. The result is a decidedly mixed bag. The music just feels wrong in some places, or the wrong piece of music was chosen in many places. Since all the music is "reused" and wasn't written with S2 in mind, it never quite dovetails and is actually distracting in some places.Luthor's escape from Prison is waaaaayyyyyy too long.Editing / pacing: Maybe it's just that I know the Lester version of S2 too well, but some of the editing is just not too good. The smash cut to Niagara Falls is jarring, and in some cases the editing is a little distracting. The pacing is a little slow, and in this new film, Superman (in costume) doesn't appear in new footage until 40 minutes into the film, unlike the Lester version of S2 where Kent switches to Superman the first three minutes of the film.The courtship dinner at the fortress is cut before Lois says, "I'm going to change into something more comfortable" and feels rushed.There are two instances where Superman's "S" is clearly backwards. Sorry, but that's just sloppy.Biggest gripe of all--Superman turns the world around to reverse time - AGAIN? I understand that this was the original ending of S2, and at some point the decision was made to move this effect to the first film. In the Lester version of S2, Kent gives Lois the much-derided "memory erasing kiss" but everyone else remembers the attack of the Phantom Zone villains. In this movie, Superman reverses time to the point where the Donner Cut of the movie never even happens. I understand Donner would have come up with a new ending for SUPERMAN II had he been allowed to continue, but the time-reversal thing in two movies feels worse than a cheat.On that note, as many reviewers have said, if Superman has reversed time, why does everyone at the diner recognize him at the end of the film? Sure, it brings emotional closure to have Kent give Rocky the bully a taste of his own medicine, but in this "new timeline" the two have never met.However...HOW I WOULD HAVE ENDED THE DONNER CUT:REMOVE THE TURN-BACK-TIME GIMMICK COMPLETELY.After the Fortress battle...The Phantom Zone villains and Luthor are taken away by the Artic police. Why relegate this to the "Deleted Scenes" section?Superman destroys the fortress, and Lois and Superman end their relationship in the arctic.After Lois and Superman speak on her balcony, he flies off and DOES NOT TURN TIME BACKWARD. Since Lois has clearly accepted the reality of the situation, there is no need to make her forget anything. They're both adults. She understands. It would play so much better.Lois begins typing "Superman saves the world"Scrap the new Daily Planet scene. Since Superman didn't turn back time it would no longer make sense and isn't necessary to further the plot.Then, Kent returns to the diner and gets his revenge on Rocky.Superman flies the flag back to the White House (Lester footage but very symbolic and powerful)Superman flies into space / end credits.For me, it would just work better. Forget continuity (Lois knowing the secret). Superman III and SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE are forgettable and SUPERMAN RETURNS is a "vague sequel" anyway.SUMMARYIt would be unfair to take away anything from Richard Lester for his version of S2. While I don't agree with some of his choices and re-shoots, despise the slapstick humor (and SUPERMAN III - Lester's baby start to finish -- was horrible) Lester arguably did his best with what he had to work with in an awkward situation back in 1979, and many of his choices for "his" S2 were very good and overall, his version of S2 holds up very well even after all these years. I still love it; it's still a classic. The revelation to Lois, the powerless Superman returning to the dark, empty fortress, "General, would you care to step outside?" the Niagara Falls rescue, the Great Gorge jump, the majority of the battle over Metropolis are all Lester footage and very well done.I miss the entire Paris scene at the Eiffel Tower. I miss Kent running into the alley at the top of the film, ripping open his shirt to reveal the "S" and blurring at super-speed into Superman. It's a great effect, iconic. A few minutes into the Lester film, Superman is flying to the rescue. That moment ranks as one of my favorites in the entire series. In the Donner cut, we never see Kent change to Superman.And so I would be remiss if I did not say, thank you Richard Lester, for your Superman II. I still love it, warts and all.Two visions of the same film--both with great strengths and certain weaknesses and distractions.So much of the RDC is brilliant and one can really see how this "true companion piece" to STM would have unfolded.Had Donner been allowed to complete his version of S2 back in 1979, the issues with music and pacing and editing wouldn't exist. So while this review mentions the editing/pacing/music issues with this cut, it is certainly understood they would have been corrected in a perfect world.No matter what, Michael Thau has done a terrific job and made our dream come true. Many thanks to him, as well as Warner Brothers, for making it possible to see Richard Donner's original vision of S2.Thank you to all the fans who lobbied for this version of the film.And to Richard Donner, there are no words to thank you for all you have done to define Superman for generations to come. Thank you for your dedication, determination, and your vision. And thank you to everyone (especially Michael Thau) responsible for bring this restored vision of S2 to life. It was well worth the wait.

$review_text.: Frequency is a movie that entertains, thrills, and stimulates, but all that can be ruined if you think too much about it. Dennis Quaid plays Frank Sullivan, a firefighter killed in a fire in 1969. Thirty years later, his son, John (played by James Caviezel), finds his father's old ham radio. Through the miracle of the Aurora Borealis (how many of THOSE do you see in New York?), they manage to talk to each other through the ages. Through this communication, John saves his father's life, but he changes history so that a famous murderer is back on the lam, and he is going to kill John's wife. So far, so good. But soon after, inconsistencies pop up. All in all however, this movie is a fine story that was short-changed in the theatres. I would recommend it to anybody who likes these kind of cross-time magical movies.

For along time he and SYLVESTER STALLONE were the go to guys when it comes to the action packed 'shoot em up' type of movie. But as the years have gone buy new faces like Farrell, Vin Decil, Will Smith, etc. have filled the theaters. But Arnold comes roaring back after a decade of hiatus to pull off a very decent movie! It was like he'd never left. Maybe a little less physical (which Is understandable at his age) but you hardly notice. Small town sheriff with a few good deputies ( Johnny Knoxville pulls the side kick off with his usual quircky humor) fights off an army of drug runners, great!' would recommend this movie to all. Oh, and he always comes away with a new catch phrase: I'll be back, or the like....this time it's: This is my town!

$review_text.: The Helen Morgan Story is a formula biopic with equal parts soap, song and gin. The thing that makes it stand out are three very good performances and a wonderful parade of vintage 1920's hits voiced for the star by Gogi Grant.From the moment the film begins to unreel with its Broadway marquee titles you know you are in for a good old-fashioned tearstained campy drama. Loosely based on the life of Helen Morgan, who is most famous today for creating the role of Julie in the groundbreaking "Show Boat" in the 20's. The film centers on her rise and fall as well as her unrequited love for gangster Larry Maddux.Playing the title role is Ann Blyth who does her best to give Helen all the pathos, drama and tragedy required in such a story. She does a fine job but one can't help but recall her best work as Veda in Mildred Pierce. Some years earlier.The real stars of the show are comedian Alan King, TV star Cara Williams and a new guy to pictures by the name of Paul Newman. These three pros take a filmland formula and mix it until it explodes.Alan King is quite a fine actor as well as a gifted comedian. He imbues the character of Benny Weaver, Larry's partner with life and humor. As Helen's best friend and Benny's moll Cara Williams shines.But the best performance is given by a very young Paul Newman who shows us just what he could do with the good for nothing huckster role. He soars in the role and gives us a preview of some of the better roles he will fill out in the future from Fast Eddie to Hud.The black and white cinematography by Ted D. McCord is stunning as are the sets and costumes. And the Warner Brothers orchestra makes the mono soundtrack burst its boundaries to near stereophonic sound. The dirction by Michael Curtiz who had been making films since 1912 is solid and dependable.One hopes that there may be a DVD release of this film in the future.(February 18, 2009) And now it is out on DVD in all it's Cinemascope glory. It looks great and the sound is full and gorgous. A must have for any Paul Newan fan as well as fan's of great old standard songs from the 20's.

$REVIEW.: FIRST IMPRESSIONS: *** NOT A FILM SUITABLE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN ***The most amazing thing about "The Incredible Melting Man" is the trailer. It plays on a few other genre videos as a preview, and it is a very impressive, though not because of its high-production values. Essentially, a uniformed nurse is screaming as she flees from something which without warning bursts explosively through a glass door in pursuit. After seeing this trailer a few dozen times I gave in and bought the video.IN A NUTSHELL: RICK BAKER HAS WON 6 OSCARS FOR BEST MAKE-UPRick Baker does a decent job with the limited time and money available to create an ozzing, yukky glob-man. Due to a space-borne virus or radiation, [sci-fi connection] a recently returned astronaut, the sole survivor of a doomed expedition to the rings of Saturn, is compelled to eat human cells to relieve the pain. This, along with the extreme disfigurement, that makes him appear like a latex man covered in dripping maple syrup, has driven him into madness.SIMILAR TO "THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT" BUT MORE EXPLICIT HORROR:Yes, this is a lot like The Quatermass Xperiment, directed by Val Guest and released in 1955. The earlier British film had more plot, made more sense, and of course was quite chilling. The Incredible Melting Man, on the other hand, has most of the science-fiction and characerizations missing in exchange for a fairly grisly mutant-vampire rampage.-- PRODUCTION CREW -- [DELIBERATELY LISTED BEFORE ACTORS]-----*- William Sachs  - Director / Screenwriter-----*- Rick Baker  - Makeup / Special Effects / Makeup Special Effects-- PRINCIPAL ACTORS -------*- Alex Rebar  - Steve West, The Incredible Melting Man-----*- Burr de Benning  - Dr. Ted Nelson-----*- Myron Healey  - Gen.

It is well acted & has a very good story line.

$REVIEW.: Wow, where to begin with this movie. It was just plain dumb. It has bland terrible dialog, they overdo the fake blood splatter, and the actors have no emotion in their voice. A man named Bill Loomis (who plays himself) is called Mr. Halloween because he runs a cheesy haunted house in this garage. He kidnaps teenagers and uses their body parts as props. Jill, played by Shannon Eastman, is probably the only worthy character, and that's not saying a lot. It is very stupid, but somewhat entertaining. Unless you're desperate for a bad movie, I wouldn't recommend MR. HALLOWEEN!!!

Baby Galileo is very slow paced and my daughter will sit through it, but she does not enjoy it like she does the others. You should try other Baby Einstein DVDs first, especially Baby Mozart.

One of Steven Sondheim's most revered musicals and masterfully acted by Angela Lansbury as Mrs.Lovett and George Hearn as Sweeney with a superb supporting cast

The tale was beautifully presented on stage for television and now looks and sounds wonderful on disc
Played with all the demanding bravura a lurid Grand Guignol story like this calls for, the minimalist sets only enhance the spectacular performances and songs---including &quot;Pretty Women&quot;, &quot;Nothing's Gonna Harm You&quot;, &quot;Joanna&quot; and of course &quot;The Ballad of Sweeney Todd&quot;
Hearn is THE perfect Sweeney Todd, wielding revenge with his razor and providing Mrs.Lovett with the perfect meat for her failing meat pie business in a seedy Victorian London neighborhood

This is the perfect material for an off-beat musical with a grisly twist

Everything is ideal in this production and rendering to DVD making it an immediate collector's item


Thank you Warner Brothers, Mr.Sondheim and an excellent cast for &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;.

$review_text.: "Three Colors Blue" is the first part of Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy... "Blue" is set in France, "White" in Poland and "Red" in Switzerland, but all production was based in France... Not only are the colors of the trilogy those of the French national flag; the original intention was meditation on the ideals of the French Revolution: freedom, equality and fraternity... This suggests a political dimension to the work... But though like most Polish filmmakers Kieslowski had his difficulties with the Polish Communist system, its collapse by the early 1990s meant that he was not only free to work where he pleased, but liberated from the necessity for his films to engage directly in the political process...In "Three Colors Blue" Juliette Binoche plays a woman whose husband and daughter are killed in a car crash... Overcome by melancholy, she progressively withdraws from life, depriving herself of possessions and refusing relationships, a state of mind conveyed in part by the director's subtle use of color blue... But eventually she is able to accept the attentions of a lover and even to offer friendship to another woman who is pregnant with her husband's child... Finally, she completes the piece of music which her husband has been commissioned to write...The result is a work that has less in common with the Polish 'Cinema of moral concern' of the late 1970s than with the tradition of the mainstream European art cinema, in its concerns with alienation and the loss of feeling, countered by the transcendent power of love...
$review_summary.: The film represents the apotheosis of European art cinema just at the moment when its very existence seemed most uncertain...

$REVIEW.: "That woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die. But, then again, so does she."- Budd informs his brother, Bill, he isn't afraid of commitment in "Kill Bill: Volume 2".Something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue (in this case its a pregnancy test). "The Bride" finishes what she started as she closes in for the kill in "Kill Bill: Volume 2"."Vol.2" continues the story of "The Bride's" revenge with the chapters "The Massacre at Two Pines" (the viewer finds out it wasn't actually a wedding but a dress rehearsal), "The Lonely Grave of Paula Shultz", "The Sadistic Training of Pei Mai", "Elle & I", & finally "Face to Face" (for the record, O-Ren Ishii, a.k.a. "Cottonmouth", received a tragic brain transplant, while Vernita Green, a.k.a. "Copperhead", got "The Bride's" point over a bowl of "Kabooms" in "Vol.1").The film, like "Vol.1", has "cult film" written all over it (this has got to be, arguably, Quentin Tarantino's two best films). "Volume 2" is less violent than the first "Bill" and keeps the blood spurting in check. The action is still great (the fight between Hannah and Thurman is claustrophobic and has some funny moments, but, I couldn't stop thinking where in the hell that damn snake was hiding! Since I hate snakes, I was waiting for it to jump out!).The performances were great throughout. Michael Madsen gives an outstanding performance as Budd (its hard not to like the guy. Yeah, even after he puts 2 slugs (full of rock salt) into "The Bride's" chest & then buries her alive). He also has some of the better lines in the film ("Wrong brother, you hateful b*tch." , is his greeting to Elle Driver on his cell phone). Daryl Hannah is awesome as the menacing, hateful Elle Driver (it hurt to see Budd go into that final goodnight but it was great at what happened to Elle!). Uma Thurman's cold, pissed off, daggers in the eyes, facial expression's to Bill while she hugs her new found daughter was the price of admission alone and David Carradine, as Bill, goes from phantom menace in the first "Bill" to jilted lover in this film is quite a revelation. The final showdown itself is quite good but not what I expected.Tarantino's direction is great, as always, this time, paying tribute to the spaghetti western (think desert heat. Lots of it). Hittori Hanzo is heard but not seen. The soundtrack is outstanding, borrowing from the great Ennio Morricone and artists Chingon, & Shivaree (both play over the closing credits). "Kill Bill" is a must see for fans of the Shaw Bros., Sergio Leone, westerns and any and all action films of the genre.I'm anticipating "Volume 2" to hit DVD in Sept. or Oct. of '04 and hopefully, an ultimate box set with director commentary (Tarantino certainly has the mouth for it) with everything but the Vasilube thrown in sometime in the near future.Above all, "Kill Bill" is, basically, a love story. What a valentine. Thanks "Q & U".

$REVIEW.: Well, the first half of the movie should have been redone. [Or at least left on the editing floor.] The second half has humor and some sentiment but, I am hard pressed to see it's merits for children or even adults of a childish nature. You really need characters to whom one can be relate or are at least recognizable in some imaginary life. Same thing for the antagonist.  I have seen more dimension in a single blank sheet of paper. The underlying story of the hard hearted bad guy going soft over the helpless guiless child, needed a lot more development, that it did not get.  Whoever did the little yellow guys got it.  The director didn't, in my opinion.  If you get it half price and skip through the first half, then you might get your money's worth.

$REVIEW.: Although the title might suggest otherwise, "Dracula III: The Legacy" is not the final part of a trilogy but rather the second half of a story begun in "Dracula II: The Ascension."  In other words, you do not need to go back to "Dracula 2000," because there is really nothing in that movie that has anything to do with these other two.  This may or may not have anything to do with the audacious but rather ludicrous idea that the reason vampires loath Christian symbols is that Dracula is really (wait for it) Judas Iscariot, but except for the fact that at the end of "Dracula 2000" the title character is a charred corpse and at the start of "Dracula II" he is a charred corpse, there is really nothing else to connect the dots (and for what it is worth, yes, I buy the explanation for why Dracula looks different in each of these films).When we go to the "to be continued" end of "Dracula II," Luke (Jason London) is desperate to find out what happened to the woman of his affections, Elizabeth Blaine (Diane Neal).  Luke is traveling with Father Uffizi (Jason Scott Lee), a vampire killer who uses a scythe to decapitate the undead.  Uffizi remains at odds with the Church because his superior, Cardinal Siqueros (Roy Scheider), insists that the goal is not just to kill vampires but to try saving their souls as well.  Father Uffizi and Luke are making their way through the Romanian countryside where they have to worry not only about vampires, but revolutionaries and other people with guns.  They discover a British TV reporter, Julia Hughes (Alexandra Westcourt), who though she was covering the war but has stumbled upon Dracula's plot to use the locals to stock his blood cellar.  The whole concern about the scientific properties of vampire blood and the emphasis on all of those ancient Eastern European superstitions regarding vampires now take a back seat to rescuing Elizabeth and stopping the orgy of blood sucking taking place over at the Dracula place.This 2005 film is again directed by Patrick Lussier, who co-wrote the script with Joel Soisson.  Lee is certainly a compelling lead figure, and London manages to provide the comic relief without becoming laughable in the wrong way, but the problem is that in a Dracula movie the big bad vampire should pop up for more than the conclusion.  Granted, the film really is more about Uffizi to the point where you wonder why it has to be a Dracula film.  But then it would be too much of a Blade rip-off.  At this point it reminds me more of the "Hellraiser" direct to video releases where Pinhead usually shows up just at the end.  If you are going to go this route then you really need the journey to be a lot more interesting, but what we have here is nothing like going off to see Marlon Brando in "Apocalypse Now."Lussier filmed both "Dracula II" and "Dracula III" at the same time in Romania, but for some reason I have not bothered to investigate we have had to wait all this time for this direct to video release.  The production values are pretty good (you get your money's worth in Romania apparently) and I liked doing a contemporary film back on Dracula's home turf.  But Rutger Hauer is not simply wasted, his performance is counter-productive.  Ultimately the whole idea here is that Uffizi is arriving at a personal crucible, and the Dracula he finds at the end is not worthy of the moment, especially given the ending they want to go with for the movie (I was going to say for the series as well, but who knows: they might be trying to squeeze a few quarts of blood out of this storyline).

$REVIEW.: American Beauty does the perfect job of portraying a disfunctional family in this decade.Kevin Spacey is wonderful in his role as Lester Burnham.  Spacey's performance by far makes this film.  He adds many touches of  comedy and sarcasm throughout this ununusal tale.Annette Bening plays  Lester's disfunctional cheating wife Carolyn. Bening should have won a best  supporting actress award for her role in AB.From Spacey's sarcasm,  Bening's quirkiness, and Mena Suvari's seductive, yet sexy role as the  young Angela Hayes; American Beauty's tale of lust, infidelity and mid life  crisis is a real joy to watch.I can not recommend this film to you  enough! It is very much worth a purchase!
$SUMMARY.: An Excellent Movie!

$review_text.: this review is for the Complete Adventures/ Blu-Ray set. The picture quality and sound for all of these Blu-Rays is fantastic, I give them 5 stars, The only problem I have with this set is the packaging, the disc's are in very tight cardboard sleeves that can eventually scratch the disc's, so I bought a pack of Memorex DVD cases that are very inexpensive on AMAZON that are GREAT, and transferred the artwork from each movie sleeve to the new cases, it was a lot of work cutting and separating these sleeves with a razor blade, but in the end they look great and it was well worth it to be sure these fantastic movies don't get damaged. I don't know what they were thinking to package them like this, if you love these movies this is the set to buy, unless spending a few bucks more for cases and doing a little extra work is too much for you. I think the cases cost about $7 and change for 8 cases.

$REVIEW.: Even though &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; is a typically fabulous BBC period piece, it feels like a guilty pleasure.  It's chock-full of romantic intrique, not to mention lots of outrageous costumes - the hats deserve special notice here.  Not only is the art direction dead-on, but the acting is also uniformly excellent.  But don't think this is serious high-brow fare. This is the type of DVD that is best watched sitting in your jammies and eating brownies with your best girl friend.

$review_text.: Besides Star Wars, Back To The Future is quite possibly the greatest trilogy ever created! What bad things can be said about this almost perfect trilogy? Nothing. The acting in the film is great, but the real magic is in the stories. Being able to go into the past and the future, who wouldn't want to do that. No matter where they go in the movie, the scenes are fantastic and it looks like they are actually back in time. You forget that you are watching a movie and feel like you have traveled with Marty. Just about everything in this trilogy is brilliant, it is about the only series I know of that has the sequels be even better than the original while the original being amazing. Highly recommend trilogy that you are truly missing out on if you haven't seen these films. You have to see them or you will have never seen what a truly great movie is! It's a HAVE to see!!!!

$REVIEW.: I was not bothered by the new cg ship or all of the cleaning up that took place on this series, but rather thought it enhanced the already engaging story telling.  The special features are many (one per disk minimum) and well thought out.The crutch lays on the case design.  Sure, it looks cool, but it's a pain in the neck to get disks out.  First you open the clamshell, pull out the yellow case, shake out the disk holder (without losing the information sheets, THEN you can flip through the disks and hope nobody messed up the order cause you can only tell the disks by the tiny 5 point print around the center.Not only that, but this case is prone to breaking.  I've gotten one from the mail (here) and the second season from a store and both had cracks in the case.  To put the cherry on top, the guy that sold me his new copy through amazon neglected to tell me his was region 2 (instead of 1 like America).  I found a way to play it, but I guess that's what I get for ordering online.

$REVIEW.: Delightful rendering of adult romance in this entertaining but slightly overlong drama about an injured child, her harried and concerned mother, a damaged horse, and the man who becomes their saviour.When young Grace and her beloved horse Pilgrim are severely maimed in a tragic horseriding accident, it appears that they are both psychologically damaged beyond repair.  Against all the odds, Grace survives this accident.  Going against all veterinary advice, Pilgrim is not euthanased.  The frantic attempts of Grace's mother Annie to heal Pilgrim, and by extension to heal Grace and their somewhat disjointed relationship, draws the 3 of them into the orbit of Tom Booker, a gentle rancher who possesses a unique and powerful gift with both animals and people.Set amidst the spectacular scenery of the Rocky Mountains, &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; is a splendid tale which extols the wonderful healing powers of love - whether it be the love of a man and a woman, the love of a mother and daughter, or the love between a girl and her horse.

$REVIEW.: If I had never seen Star Trek TNG before watching this episode I'd probably give it a 5. But Knowing how awesome the Q episodes were from TNG and remembering the amazing dynamic between he and Picard had makes this episode fall flat just a bit.I mainly attribute this to Janeway, and her lack of chemistry on screen with the Q's. There was just something about her performance in this episode that annoyed me to tears. I think it's cause most of the time she is doing "The Rock" eyebrow stare as a substitute for acting. And you see a lot of that here because almost everyone else is absent (no B'Elanna, Chakotay, Kes, Paris, etc)But my personal nit-picking aside it's still enjoyable and I recommend watching it. Also to anyone who thinks this is an amazing episode also go watch the TNG Q episodes....they will probably blow your socks off all the way to the delta quadrant.

$REVIEW.: As a relatively new martial arts film addict, I have to say that I loved this movie.  American martial arts films pale in comparison to Hong Kong originals such as this, and Legend of the Red Dragon proved to be a great little detour from the road of hand to hand kung fu action I have been following for some time now.  The main weapons of choice here are spears and darts, and the many fight scenes are simply incredible.  The laws of physics get swept right out of the window, but that's okay be me; only one or two moves here struck me as patently ridiculous, but even these were exciting and thrilling.  The dubbing was indeed rather bad, but I came to this movie for action, and that is what I got.Jet Li stars as the warrior Hung Hei-Kwun, a loyalist to the Ming dynasty; as the movie opens, we see him return to his village to find everyone there slaughtered by the Manchus - everyone except his infant son Man Ting (Miu Tse).  Vowing revenge, Kwun lets his toddler (and fate) decide whether the boy lives to join his father's fight or joins his mother in death; the boy chooses wisely.  A betrayal of grand proportions soon finds Kwun surrounded by enemy fighters; many a martial arts hero has wiped out a troop of baddies all by himself, but Kwun does it with his infant son strapped to his back all the while.  When we next meet up with Kwun and his son seven years later, young Ting is the baddest little dude in town - a kung fu fighting machine, an incredibly disciplined young warrior, and a serious lad who probably has more self-control and wisdom than even his father.  Now penniless, Kwun agrees to serve as bodyguard to a wealthy merchant, and it is in his service that he gets to know Red Bean (Chingmy Yau), half of a mother-daughter con artist team currently plotting to rob Kwun's employer.  As all of this is going on, a master at the threatened Shaolin school is busy tattooing a map to the Shaolin treasure on the backs of five of his pupils in an effort to keep the treasure safe (although the fact the boys always seem to be together sort of defeats the purpose).  An old enemy of Kwun's, one whom he thought he had killed, wants that treasure, and he especially wants to kill Kwun.  This dude looks like he stuck his head in a pot of boiling water for about half an hour, but he is strong and invincible thanks to a witch's spell.  He also drives a metal super-car, something you just don't see everyday in films about the China of the distant past.  The Batmobile thing pushes the envelope way too far, but the movie is good enough to make up for the filmmaker's indiscretion.Anyway, Kwun and Ting must fight to defeat the evil man from Kwun's past, protect the tattooed boys and in doing so save the Shaolin treasure, and deal with his feelings toward the lovely Red Bean.  For the most part, he just fights.  All of the action sequences in the film blew me away (but of course I'm not hard to impress when it comes to this type of action); you've got claws and darts being flung pell-mell out of nowhere, sword fights galore, and a little bit of kung fu thrown into the mix.  Li and his fellow performers are lightning quick in their movements, the main female characters are a force to reckon with, and young Ting is just a joy to watch.  Not only can he lick five boys his own age without breaking a sweat, he is basically an equal partner with his father, fighting right alongside him when the moment arises.  Their weapons are a little on the souped-up side, but, boy oh boy, it makes for some spectacular fight scenes.The biggest mystery to me when it comes to Hong Kong films such as this is the comedy aspect.  As this movie progresses, an initially grim, sober tale is injected with increasing doses of comedy (only a small part of which can be attributed to the less than perfect dubbing).  Some of it is funny, but the movie suffers a little bit in the process.  Still, though, the amazing fight scenes alone make this a film that any martial arts fan should enjoy, and I might add in closing that the cinematography is also quite good, boasting one particularly beautiful scene midway through the film.

$review_text.: The BBC Earth documentary "Yellowstone: Battle For Life" is yet another triumph for the folks that have created all the BBC Earth documentaries


 The imagery is amazing; the vistas are sweeping; and the clarity of the interactions between animals is remarkable


 Overall, this documentary removes all of your preconceived notions about what you thought Yellowstone might be like; I, for one, didn't know much about the boiling pools and the sweeping mountain views.If I could give one piece of negative feedback, it would have to be Peter Firth's narration

 The content was fine; his voice is just not suited to a documentary of this type
 Now admittedly, he has a hard act to follow in David Attenborough, whose throaty voice dominated other BBC Earth documentary series; but his lack of intonation and flat delivery does take away from the grandeur of the series

 Others have recommended that you watch this on mute; I disagree because with the narration comes some spectacular music as well, which you wouldn't want to miss.Despite the less than perfect narration, this one's definitely a keeper and much in line with other BBC Earth projects


 I wouldn't hesitate to add it to your collection.

$review_text.: Let's face it, we've become pretty sophisticated, which means that Frankenstein and Godzilla don't really cut it anymore.  And the hack-n-slash gorefest crap that passes for horror these days is almost not worth the time it takes to yawn through them.  So when I find a good, solid monster movie that makes me tense up and say "Oh my god!" at least once, I know I'm on to something.If you don't already know, Cloverfield is set in post-9/11 Manhattan.  During a Bon Voyage party, something attacks the city, decapitating the Statue of Liberty, in a very memorable moment, and laying waste to the Empire State building, the two most enduring symbols of New York.  Add to that the memory of the events of September 2001, and you have the sense that this story isn't going to end well.There's a breakneck race through the streets and subways of Manhattan, and ever-longer peeks at the monster and its spawn, but there's never enough time to take it all in, never time to allow the mind to process exactly what it is that's happening, so the imagination takes over, which any old school horror aficionado will tell you is the most effective way to scare the bejeebers out of someone.  Let their mind do the work for you, let them imagine what is happening, what could happen, what will happen.The casting of relative unknowns and the use of a near-real-time narrative are both critical to allowing the audience to put itself into the story.  I only saw one actor with whom I was familiar, and it did push me right out of the film for a moment because it suddenly registered as just a movie, an entertainment.  Until that moment I was very caught up in the narrative.  I know that when I'm sitting forward in my chair urging the characters to "follow the rats, always follow the rats!" that I've been quite properly hooked.In the end, Cloverfield is really nothing more than a monster movie for the 21st century, but one which doesn't depend on blood and gore, or some lunatic with a butcher knife.  It's good fun.

$review_text.: The wide disparity between the previous reviewers may be likely due to the fact they may not have actually seen this DVD.It's stunning. Absolutely stunning. Here we have an entire Springsteen show (the first half aired live on MTV Europe) in front of a rabid Barcelona audience. There are things on this disc that you can show to people that aren't Springsteen fans that will make them convert. In a heartbeat.Barcelona is known for being particularly Springsteen-philic. It shows. I doubt if  you will ever see a concert where the crowd is so enthusiastic and appreciative, yet considerate (they shut up when they're supposed to...) and knowledgeable. The &quot;Rising&quot; album hadn't been out all that long, yet they're singing along to most of the then-new tunes.The picture is crisp and vivid, and the audio sounds terrific! My disc #2 had a little glitch where it wouldn't initially play, but it was momentary.The performance itself goes without saying. It is obvious that the E Streeters are energized by the crowd. Reaction shots of the various members throughout the show tell the story. The first portion of the show was pretty standard &quot;Rising Tour&quot; stuff, but it seems that every time the band turns up their performance, the audience rises to the occasion. Seriously...the crowd even sang instrumental parts! They knew the lyrics to the new songs, and mind you, this is Spain we're talking about. English isn't even their mother tongue.There's a two-song somber mini-set from &quot;The Rising&quot;, &quot;Empty Sky&quot; and &quot;You're  Missing&quot; that are simply haunting. The show then swells, a joyous &quot;Waitin' On A Sunny Day&quot; leading into &quot;The Promised Land&quot; and so on, until Bruce opens up &quot;She's The One&quot;.That song comes off absolutely ferocious...the band so tight you'll simply marvel. It's like they put their collective feet on some unseen accelerator pedal and took OFF.Then Bruce turns a relatively non-descript (for him) party tune, &quot;Mary's Place&quot;, into a barn-burner. It's a joy to watch...folding in several old Motown/Stax/soul songs into the mix. The Palau Sant Jordi literally lifts off.After the MTV Broadcast ends, he does several &quot;requests&quot;...songs not necessarily done night after night. Watching him call out songs, seeing the band scramble to get the right guitar, etc., is part of the fun. It happens several times during the show.Solo piano versions of &quot;Spirit In The Night&quot; and &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; are striking...it's hilarious when Bruce flubs a line during the latter tune.The encore opens with a tour rarity, &quot;Night&quot; (another request), a rollicking &quot;Ramrod&quot;...heck, you can see the setlist for yourself. It's one highlight after another.As he's bidding the audience farewell, after &quot;Land of Hope and Dreams&quot; (the standard second encore concert closer at the time), you can see him giving in to the crowd and calling out to the band for &quot;one more...&quot;Thunder Road&quot;.The performers all seem to be having a great time...smiles are everywhere. Their interplay is something you rarely get on concert discs nowadays.I honestly can't see the fault in this disc...I do not understand the negativity whatsoever! A 3-hour, reference quality complete concert DVD?The add-on mini-documentary is fine, with brief tantalizing clips of tours gone by...but make sure you stay through the whole thing.The &quot;Night of the Living Boss&quot; clip, hidden at the end, is a hoot. Shot at Fenway Park, it uses the opening &quot;Take Me Out To The Ball Game&quot; and &quot;Diddy Wah Diddy&quot; to underscore some amazing footage. It'll bring a smile to your face, Bruce fan or not.Now, it's time to start putting together the footage from the past. It's time for &quot;official&quot; bootlegs. There's GOTTA be footage from the &quot;Born In The USA&quot; tours, if not earlier. Let's start releasing those, huh? Please?

Yes, the beautiful Brit who played the sexy Margiana in 'The Golden Voyage of Sinbad' three years earlier is back as the scantily clad Princess Dia and she looks as incredible as ever.Watch Princess Dia in her two piece loincloth run from the dumbest looking bunch of blow-up dinosaurs and giant, woman eating, telepathic birds you've ever seen. Make no mistake about it, this DVD is for Caroline Munro fans only, a silly but lovely guilty pleasure to be sure.

$review_text.: I remember the first time I saw Jim Gaffigan's special "Beyond the Pale." It took me several days to stop laughing and I still to this day find myself in the grocery store, casually walking down the frozen foods aisle, pass the hot pockets shelf, and just start dying of laughter.Finally, Jim has a new special to follow up on previous awesomeness. I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of the special and it was totally hilarious. Not only will Jim Gaffigan fans love it, but anybody who enjoys laughing will love it. The genius of Jim's comedy is its accessibility. Grandparents and grade schoolers can all laugh at the ridiculousness of camping when you're a youngster.This special has a little bit of everything for everybody. I can't recommend this special enough and I suggest everyone watch it live on Comedy Central Sunday, March 29th at 9 PM on Comedy Central. Then, buy the DVD to see all the extras that are guaranteed to be as great as the special.

$REVIEW.: Many of the Amazon reviewers of "Burn After Reading" fail to understand, or they resent, if only dimly understood, the point of all Coen Brothers films: to provide an entertainment in which the audience can feel comfortably superior to characters that are in over their heads. All the stylistic and character aspects that many reviewers construe as flaws are in fact the entire point of watching a Coen Brothers film. Where else, other than as a Amazon film reviewer, can one feel so smugly superior and amused at the strivings and shortcomings of others, while celebrating the satisfaction of the bully, with the balm of comedy and farce, than in a Coen Brothers film? Not all of us can be paid to feel that way, some of us have to pay others, like the Coens, to provide us with two hours or so of escape to these wonderful sentiments. "Burn After Reading" is in fact yet another deliciously perceptive jab at the American reverence for and addiction to optimism, excessive self-esteem and non-judgemental behavior. The reason a lot of reviewers don't like this film is because the characters are probably a little too close to home for comfort.

In that light, it is a sadmovie.But going through life half the time lying creates difficulties andfunny situations.  Christopher Walkin is great in this movie, he is thefather.  Alessandro Nivola is new to me, I haven't seen him in any othermovie before, he is the son.  I thought his acting was great!  The situationsthat they get into are of course unrealistic, but very funny.I am giving 4 star for this movie, I liked it.  I hope you like it too.

$review_text.: Hardcore prisoner and unrelenting sociopath Lee Ray Olivier, (played by the fantastic Ray Liotta) is put to death by lethal injection.  When he wakes up again inside the morgue, things get weird for him.  Dr Michael Copeland (the fantastic Willem DaFoe), a Neuro-pharmacologist, is in the final stages of testing his newest drug - on humans.  Oliver is offered a chance to participate or go through his execution for real.  He agrees, but he's far from the perfect patient.At first he's atrociously violent, attacking guards and attempting escapes, but gradually the drug begins to work.  Oliver's tattoos are removed, preparing him for the final test - a normal life in public.  Dr. Copeland's dream is to take a violent offender and turn them into an average, everyday Joe.  Copeland makes sure Oliver knows, "You're only alive because of me."  Gradually, Oliver calms down and begins to exhibit rational thought.Released to work and live in a normal environment while wearing an ankle bracelet, Oliver meets Teresa (Michelle Rodriquez) and they become friendly.  But, can a sociopath actually become an empathetic person?  Can a conscience develop if it wasn't present before?  This movie has quite a few twists to it that will leave you on the edge of your seat.  Ray Liotta's transformation from the murderous killer to the pacifist is a landmark in his acting career, one of his best performances ever.While not as violent or graphic as 'Strangeland', another film of experimental pacification of monstrous personality disorders, 'Control' is still a very good movie.  My primary complaint is that the DVD did not have English subtitles for the hearing impaired, so crank the volume up.  Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: What a cheap way to exploit Jamie Lee's impressive lung power. If you can't figure out the killer after the opening sequence, you haven't seen enough horror movies. O.K., we know who the killer is, but he hides in costumes of his victims, not showing his face, so what. They spend too much time making it look like the magician or others. It does excell, in hiding him on the train, but we kind of know what to expect for an ending, at least I did. The acting is o.k., the movement of the film is rather slow, except for a great chase sequence toward the end with Jamie and the killer. David Copperfield should have been the first thrown off the train, what a cheesehead, stick to magic, your acting sucks. The effects are the worst I have ever seen, looks like a 3rd graders school project. Jamie Lee excels as usual, check her out in The Fog or Halloween, much better. This film was a quick buck during the slasher film era, Jamie got a check, and second booking, she has moved on. Serious, if anyone was surprised by the identity of the killer at the end, you really were not paying attention. The back of the dvd case even differs from the film. The banner by the campfire in the film says "Happy New Year", on the case, "Happy Halloween". Are they trying to trick potential customers that this is another Halloween themed film, pretty bad. Thank God for John Carpenter, he is God.

$REVIEW.: No, the endless rows of troops and supporters are not special effects - they're the real thing in all their terror and power.  Nothing like this can be seen in the world today except maybe in North Korea.  This movie is a priceless historical document and a study in mass psychology and propaganda.  Hopefully, it will always stay in circulation, where it best serves as a warning against the power of charismatic dictators and blind devotion to The State, and unlimited power.Maybe it would be best if this movie was sold back-to-back with footage and photos of the horrors produced by Nazi Germany, and hopefully end with some photos of the Red Army's vicious three-day pillage of Berlin, where soldiers were given 'liberty without restraint,' to punish the Germans in the most horrific ways, and the Soviet propaganda footage of a gigantic concrete Nazi emblem being blown to smithereens by dynamite.  That way you could see the gross effect of Hitler's spell over Germany, and the absolute horror of war - Hell on Earth.If you ever wondered how Hitler gained so much power, this movie will explain it to you.  A total loser and drifter for most of his young life, then-Corporal Hitler stumbled across his hidden talent as an orator when given an end-of-service assignment of preaching to troops exiting the defeated Werchmact about the dangers of communism.  His superiors immediately recognized his latent talents, and made more use of his speaking abilities.  From there he started his career in politics.  In 'Triumph,' Adolph Hitler is at his best - or worst.  Not only did Hitler have an amazing talent for public speaking, but he was a shrewd propagandist.  He once said that torchlight rallies were a favorite of his because it was easiest to bend people's will at the end of the day.  Anyone who looks at Germany and says 'that could never happen here,' is dead wrong.  All that's needed is a right ingredient mix of timing, politics, and the state of the human condition.  Then, add in a charismatic dictator, and watch the troops march and 'leftist' opposition get crushed on the road to nationalistic Armageddon.This movie will silence anyone who says that protest isn't patriotic.  While the leaders of any nation would pee their pants to have millions of people screaming 'heil' at each of theis 'seigs,' we now know all too well the results of blind devotion to a leader.  This movie is all the warning we need.  Watch it, at least once, so that you can recognize the traits of nationalism, and so you can gain a better sense of propaganda and rhetoric.  Too many people can't identify truth from schpiel already!Notice this movie doesn't show anyone countering the Nazi movement.  That's because anyone 'liberal' enough to say war is bad, would have, at the time this movie was made, found themselves wearing a piano-wire necktie.While it's tempting to ban this movie outright because of the horrific acts of Nazi Germany, that would be a massive mistake.  Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.-- JJ Timmins

$review_text.: If you're bored and want to waste some time, in a relatively pleasant diversion - similar to watching a well-stocked fish tank - this movie would work. I mean, the fish are never truly boring but they're never truly interesting. And every now and then, a big one eats a tiny one and makes it worth it.. but this almost never happens. Same with the funny moments in this movie. It's almost like the actors had a lot of fun, but it seems like watching an extended rehearsal. It's oddly disengaged (no pun intended) from the audience. And it is LONG. Longer than the actual clock time, which is some kind of quantum warp they accomplished. I think I laughed five times, chuckled six times, and smiled indulgently often. Then I started browsing online too, which made the movie go faster. Note: I like BOTH of these actors, a lot, so I wanted to like this movie a lot. Near the end, I admit I said out loud, "Is this thing EVER going to be over?" I also muted the volume for the last five or so minutes so I could focus on browsing the internet.Note: If you want the quality, really enjoyable romantic comedy that you will laugh AND care about - the way this one was meant to but didn't achieve - watch The Proposal with Sandra Bullock.

$REVIEW.: I, for some odd reason, didn't expect too much from this picture. I certainly didn't expect it to be this good. But it is.The storyline is fairly simple and is not new in itself (although the setting is new). A capable young chap is caught by some evil men, escapes and has to run for his life (and indeed also for his wife and childs life). However, it is all very well acted, directed, edited and scored. The cinematography is top notch and the actors well cast.I did get a feeling of it being a bit too modern in style though. Both in dialogue and action. Except for the fact that it is acted in ancient surroundings (and the human sacrifices) it's got a very modern feeling to it.In a word, it's one evenings worth of solid entertainment.

$review_text.: As many people from cities by The Great Lakes know, the lake effect can change with variable winds and bring snow squalls and rains unexpectedly
 The winds of change are presented in a relationship that straddles a time barrier, a time warp that is bridged by a magic mailbox where messages are transported back and forth between two residents of a specially designed "lake house"
 One resident is a Chicago architect, Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), whose father was the architect of the stunning, but idiosyncratic glass "lake house" on "stilts"

 He lives there in 2004
 Kate Forster, a resident doctor, lives at the residence in 2006


 She moves out, but leaves a message in the mailbox for the new owner to forward her mail to her new address

 He intercepts the note two years earlier and leaves her a note that her new address is under construction, and her reference to animal tracks left on the residence aren't apparent

 Both are curious by the discrepancies of the other's notes

 His letters have the heading 2004; her letters have the heading 2006
 Then a mysterious but lively exchange of letters takes place
 They address these concerns, and the movie makes us take some leaps to bridge the incredulity gap


 (Wouldn't most people dismiss the other as wacko with some sort of anomoly?)  Fortunately, even though there is enough effort by the audience to suspend disbelief, there is no magic Post Office actually delivering the mail

 Somehow they believe one another and fall in love.There are some connections made besides the mailbox over the two year communication gap:  One is the same resident dog who is present for both owners; the other is a copy of Kate's favorite book, Jane Austin's 'Persuasion'
 The former never forgets an owner, so his straying provides a meeting between the two during a time she wouldn't know the context of the letters in 2004


 It is her birthday, and her trusting, live-in boyfriend invites the stranger neatly enough when his dog runs to the new residence they share


 The event turns into a date that becomes awkward upon her boyfriend's discovery
 An emotional connection is made, even though Kate thinks of him as a newcomer in her life
 The book provides a tangible presence and a fine allusion to another story about an old-fashioned courtship where the protagonists wait for a romance tested over time.Alex has two barriers to straddle


 He struggles with a hard-to-please architect mentor father who in Alex's own words, "...knew how to make a house, but not a home."  The emotional baggage is telling between himself and his father, especially when his dad's health heads south
 (And all of this is presented well with the friendly sibling rivalry with his brother, Henry.)  But the biggest barrier is trying to schedule a date with the future Kate

 He goes to Chicago's best restaurant to make a date two years in advance with her and shares his plan in a letter
 He does his best to keep the engagement, yet she is stood up, and from there she abandons hope of them ever connecting
 That is until she discovers the reason for his failure, and this leads to a chance..

a chance that one can alter events and change the future.'The Lake House' is a pleasing and manipulative romantic movie
 It plays upon all of our buttons

 Relying on narrated letters, the movie draws upon films like 'Sleepless in Seattle' and its follow-up, 'You've Got Mail'

 Romance mainly emanates from the longing presented, and the narration of the correspondence crossing the two-year distance for both would-be lovers


 As languid as some of the scenes linger on, the resolution is strong enough to recommend this stylish and heartwarming flick about love that is meant to bridge the gap of space and time

 Just like "the lake effect," 'The Lake House' sneaks up on one and provides powerful changes that neatly blow away the debris and provide a clearer day.

$REVIEW.: Quite literally. As a technical exercise in film making this is impressive and clever. As a 'moral lecture' it is execrable. We witness a family, including their child, being tormented, humiliated, tortured and murdered by two psycopaths. It is truly shocking and offensive, so yes, job done. The target audience may be the people who 'enjoy' the 'Hostel' and 'Saw' franchises, but are they going to (a) see the irony, or (b) care about it if they do?  Haneke subverts conventional narrative and plot, puts our demons up on the screen, has them run riot and emerge triumphant. This is a technically accomplished exercise in egregious sadistic nihilism masquerading as an indictment of other, less cold blooded, examples of the genre. No story is played out. There is no hope, no help, no catharsis, no justice and no judgements are made. The viewers deep need to protect and avenge the family is provoked, toyed with (one of the 'Funny Games') and denied. This is one of the occasional horror stories that emerge from the real world presented without narrative or plot. In what sense does this confront cinematic violence, except perhaps to remind us that justice is seldom done in this world?The conceit behind the film is therefore obvious, have the audience identify with the family and abhor their merciless tormentors, yet have the family progressively lose all hope and the perpetrators walk away free to do it all again. Its not even a clever conceit. The onscreen violence is minimal, but its basically psychological warfare against anyone with a decent mindset who is unfortunate enough to view it. Against this background it makes no valid points about onscreen violence because it doesnt really address the subject. The target seems to be the moral hypocrisy of a society that consumes 'torture porn' but Haneke and his clever fanbase are missing the point. There is nothing inherently wrong in presenting nightmares in entertainment. That is as old as the human race and started when we were in tribes listening to storytellers around campfires. Portraying our demons in fiction for our heroes to destroy is a classic way of exorcising them. We know real life can be appallingly cruel, that why art developed to enhance the good and mitigate the bad. Does that seem reasonable, Michael?Another reviewer posted a positive review with the argument 'we're talking about it, so mission accomplished'. The same could of course be said about 911 or the Beslan massacre. I dont know how many casual readers there will be of this piece, and I know if there are, this will only add to the curiosity, but I would seriously urge anyone to avoid this. It is almost diabolically wicked and I felt like I needed a bath after watching it. Tim Roth apparently turned it down at first, pondered the kind of film he was in during shooting and has apparently refused to watch it since completion. I only wish I'd followed his advice. The only small mercy is that Haneke has found film as an outlet. One wonders where his moral superiority, contempt and righteous anger at society might have taken him had he not.

$review_text.: Besides garnering two Oscar nods for Best Score and Sound, the 1942 re-release of Charlie Chaplin's THE GOLD RUSH is superior to the original for a few reasons:1.) Charlie precisely recalls the dialogue. His narration syncs up perfectly with actors' mouth movements and eliminates the need for intertitles.2.) It's projected at natural speed, not the supersonic kind we often associate with silent movies. None of these pre-sound works were ever meant to be seen at such distortedly fast speeds.3.) This one includes a rewritten Chaplin score, plus some occasional enhancing SFX.The only downside: Soundtrack-added dub is forced to sacrifice edges of the original silent print.Famous sequences: Charlie with a live bear, dressed in a chicken suit, eating a boiled shoe, in a cabin teetering on a cliff edge and doing the dinner roll dance. An absolute classic.Also included is the half-hour short, PAY DAY, a battle of the sexes farce.SYNOPSIS-- In order to keep her bricklayer hubby, good time Charlie, at home, Mrs. C. confiscates his wages. Charlie manages to lift her purse and goes on the town anyway. Guess what awaits him when he finally calls it a night?Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll ratings.(8.3) The Gold Rush (silent-1925/sound-1942) - Charlie Chaplin/Georgia Hale/Mack Swain (uncredited: Fred Karno Jr./Lita Grey/Sid Grauman/Heinie Conklin/Tiny Sandford)(7.5) Pay Day (silent-1922) - Charlie Chaplin/Phyllis Allen/Mack Swain/Edna Purviance/Syd Chaplin

This is the work of genius?  This is nothing but a strange and weird animation.  First clue to the reviewer that giving tips on how to watch this movie: a movie shouldn't need cliff notes.  Nothing, and I do mean nothing in this film makes one ioda of sense to me and I can't believe I'm wasting more time in posting a review this garbage.

$REVIEW.: This yoga workout is perfect for de-stressing and relaxing at the end of the day.  Since it is a gentle practice, it is appropriate for even beginners.  However, there is not a great deal of time devoted to instruction in between poses; each pose flows into the other.  So if you have never done yoga before, you may want to watch it all the way through before attempting to do it, or try a more instructionally focused DVD to begin with.From the picture on the cover and the title, I figured the set would be softly lit for this practice.  Not so.  It was brightly lit and airy, but candles were everywhere.  Although it was not what I expected, the set was still nice to look at.  There are several stretches that are done with eyes closed or facing the ground, though, so you won't be looking at the set all that much.The music is gorgeous, new agey with nature sounds such as birds chirping and flowing water.  This helps to set the tranquil mood.The poses consist of stretches, nothing too strenuous.  Some include the cat stretch, forward bends, and a brief vinyasa (movement flowing with breath).  At the end of the workout, I felt amazingly relaxed and healthy.

$REVIEW.: I've seen the various adaptations of Jane Austen's "Emma," but no movie (or actress) really seemed to capture the lighthearted brightness, romance and sweetness of that book
Fortunately, such is not the case with the BBC's latest adaptation -- it's a sunlit, enchanting little story that dances along at a leisurely pace, and has a brilliant cast headed by the astonishingly good Romola Garai.After matchmaking her sister and her governess Miss Taylor (Jodhi May), Emma Woodhouse (Garai) fancies herself an expert on human nature, and on "nudging" couples into matrimony

The acerbic Mr
Knightley (Jonny Lee Miller) isn't impressed.And after Miss Taylor becomes Mrs

Weston, Emma ends up becoming best buddies with Harriet, (Louise Dylan) a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the illegimate daughter of "somebody." Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her, and focuses her efforts on matching Harriet to the rather smarmy but charming Mr

Elton

When Emma's latest matchmaking attempt falls apart, she vows not to mess with people's lives again -- but she can't help but be interested by Harriet's potential suitors.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard of her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill (Rupert Evans), and the reserved and "perfect" Miss Jane Fairfax (Laura Pyper)


Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax -- and ends up alienating her further on a disastrous day out
And as she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, "Emma" is the frothiest and lightest, and this adaptation reflects that well -- it's bright and sunny most of the time, full of "fairyland" balls, lush green fields and forests, and the a quaint little village

There's some moments of seriousness (such as the somber, rainy examination of the similarities between Jane, Emma and Frank), but nothing that keeps Emma Woodhouse's sunny charmed life from proceeding as usual.Fortunately, the story also explores Emma's maturation over the course of a year or two, and the writers also expand on the feelings and lives of Frank, Jane and Mr


Woodhouse

Ir's laced with plenty of clever dialogue ("That man is so full of himself, I'm surprised he can stay on his horse!"), gently barbed humor and beautifully orchestrated moments of subtle romance, such as Emma and Knightley's dance together or Emma's simple declaration of "I began to examine my own heart, and there YOU were."And Romola Garai makes the perfect Emma: young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but  also naive and a little snobbish


She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, and Garai makes her lovable and endearing even when she screws up


Jonny Lee Miller is similarly brilliant as the restrained, stern Mr
Knightley with his sharp wit and unconventional habits (such as when he tells Emma why he rode a horse to a dinner party).The supporting cast is also brilliant: Michael Gambon is of particular delight as Emma's dismal hypochondriac dad, who still tried his best for his daughters, and Jodhi May is amazing as Emma's ex-governess


Dylan was adorable as the naive Harriet, and Evans and Pyper are excellent as Frank and Jane


Tamsin Greig, Blake Ritson and Robert Bathurst all do good jobs as well -- and Christina Cole is wonderfully horrible as the snobby, domineering Mrs


Elton.The newest adaptation of "Emma" is enchanting from beginning to end -- beautiful direction, solid writing, and an amazing cast


Definitely a must-see for Austen aficionados.

$review_text.: At the time of this review, here are the bonus features included in this two-disk set.  Keep in mind, this could change, so take it for what it's worth.*Deleted scenes*Music videos by A-Teens and the Hawaiian Chorus*Lilo and Stitch Island Adventure Games*Disneypedia: Hawaii*A Stitch in Time*(more to come)To say that this release has been a long-time coming would be an understatement.  As a huge fan of this film, the three that followed it, and the television series, to finally see this movie given the royal treatment is a real treat.While Disney's 2-D animated films of this decade have not exactly set the entertainment world on fire, I have enjoyed many of them very much, "Emperor's New Groove" and "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", included.  This movie was the next in line after those two; it went on to gross $127 million at the box office and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature."Lilo & Stitch" is the story of a young Hawaiian girl, Lilo, who chances upon what she thinks is an unusual-looking dog in an animal shelter.  She takes this strange creature into her home...and everything goes completely nuts.  The blue "abomination" (as he is called in the film) turns out to be an alien science experiment gone awry, with a renegade spirit and a hunger for distruction.If you haven't seen this film, I won't go into many more details, because I don't want to give the movie away.  But trust me when I say this: "Lilo & Stitch" is one Disney animated film that is worth your time.  It is funny, touching, engaging, witty, heartfelt; you name it.And for those of us who have seen this movie, who LOVE this film, who consider it to be one of the best things to ever come out of the House of Mouse...this two-disk set is a long-time coming.

All of this comes brilliantly delivered from Dame Judy Dench and Geoffrey Palmer who are both world-class actors and masters of their craft. They are incredible to watch and my husband who usually doesn't go for this kind of programming could sit and watch this show for hours. I strongly recommend that everyone give this show a try. It's a prime example that excellent television doesn't require sex, violence and rampant profanity.

$review_text.: The new Night Stalker seem a TV clone. They smell and taste  like the X-Files, Twilight Zone, Outer Limits and Dark Shadows, with a nod of the hat to the classic Kolchak The Night Stalker.When Dan Curtis produced this show in the 1970's, the show had an edge of the occult-it was so mysterous. Then there was Files and many shows like it.The new Carl Kolshak, played by Stuart Townsend, seem so too cool for the role, not like Darrin McGavin did in the 70's. He drives a hip car with police scanner,  nice pressed clothes rather than a wrinkled suit nand over equiped for every mysteryThis Kolchak show seems to act more and more like Fox Mulder, than a hard hitting news reporter. His back story acted like the Fugitive, with the supposed killing of his wife as part of his Mythos.Gabrielle Union , who plays  Perri the "senior crime reporter" who has worked at the LA Beacon for all of four years, seems wasted in her role  of second Banana to Townsend's Kolchak. Union is a good actress normally. However she is NO SCULLY, trust me...she acts like eye candied, girl wonder to Kolchak..and fails badly. There could have been mjore fleshiness to her character, other than the one dimension she shows here.Lets say the acting is good NOT great and the storylines are bad VERY bad. Most of you WILL feel as if you watched them before...X-Files fans take note, YOU ARE EXCUSED from watching...files did a better job!The show lasted six episodes of TV. When it was merrifully pulled for ABC TV, the show  had 4 episodes unaired . This set includes them..and a DVD rom feature is a missing script which was not shot, due to the series being canceledI usually like a box set of limited/one season show--this is one i should been left on the shelvesBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD

$review_text.: The new installment of the "Bourne" franchise stars Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, an "Operation Outcome" agent, and Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing responsible for his medical check-ups. The filmmakers of "The Bourne Legacy" should thank their luck that they were able to have these gifted players, for without them, "The Bourne Legacy" would have been a total mess.The storyline of "Legacy" itself is not complicated. Now that some of the CIA's top secrets are publicly exposed, Edward Norton's character Eric Byer is hired to erase all the evidences that would lead to further investigation. "The Bourne legacy" is not about Jason Bourne, but a chain of events that was triggered by his action seen in "Ultimatum."However, despite several fine action sequences, "Legacy" tends to be tedious, taking so much time trying to explain everything. Locations are interesting, and Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are both impressive, but the film lacks suspense, suffering from the heavy-handed narrative. Also, the character of Aaron Cross is not very interesting, lacking the complexity that Jason Bourne is allowed to have.To make a new Bourne film means to give a new story and characters to the audiences who have enjoyed the Jason Bourne story arc. Tony Gilroy (screenwriter of the three previous Bourne films) is in charge of this difficult job of expanding the trilogy's universe. To do so, he not only employed ideas like brainwashing and chemicals; the new director called back some of the franchise's supporting players including Joan Allen, Albert Finney and Scott Glenn. Neither of them works. The scientific elements are pretentious and clich&eacute;d while, as to the presence of these veteran actors, they only help remind us of the merits of "Ultimatum," which knew how to entertain the viewers.After all, what is the point of making another "Bourne" movie when Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is not coming back? In spite of the electrifying acting from Jeremy Renner, "The Bourne Legacy" will not answer that question. Perhaps things would have been better with someone as director, who remembers the Bourne trilogy was first and foremost made for entertainment. As it is, "Legacy" remains a so-so action movie with A-list actors.

Hellboy is near classic of great proportion as played by the underrated Ron Perlman (Beauty and the Beast) Perlman is an actor you probley wouldn't recognize as he has had to wear so much facial make up in his career. Also he played in a lot of low budget movies. He imbues 'Hellboy' with a real humanity and a scathing wit. How am I ever gonna get a girl when I drive around in a garbage truck? John Hurt as his father has a little to do but that he loves Hellboy there is no doubt having to rescued him on the night he came from hell. Dr. Broom adopts the boy and they live at the Center For Paranormal Studies in New Jersey with a fish like creature and a fire starter girl who Hellboy loves to pieces.

The much talked about first half-hour of the movie is indeed gruesome. If you have a weak stomach or can't stand the really horrible war pictures you can skip this, there is no important storyline in it and therefore unimportant for the rest of the movie, it is however a brilliant piece of filming.The movie itself is mostly set in shades of green and grey, making the imagery beautiful and therefore worth seeing. It's again a great Spielberg movie, especially in its realism and if you want to get a good view about how D-Day was see this, maybe together with the great mini-series Band of Brothers.

Just as every other live action Trek series, this is definitely a series that is worth to be called Star Trek. The writing is just as sharp as the original series and the animation almost matches the look and feel of the TV show. What makes this a really cool series and makes it even better is the fact that the real actors, except for Walter, return to reprise their roles from the TV series. Overall, if you are a fan of the first Trek series, then you will LOVE this. Worth having in your Trek collection for sure!

$review_text.: I confess, I am a Music Man freak.  I sing allong to the soundtrack at least once a week, and I still can't get enough of it.What makes me love the musical so much is that the music and the settings make me feel like I really am in &quot;IOWAY&quot;.  I see Professor Harold Hills all over the place in real life, and this play shows you that they can be human beings and have anima (soul).  Robert Preston was born to do this role.  It is a true shame that after the fame he achieved on the stage and in this film of The Music Man, he did not recieve as much fame in his later movies.  It's hard to believe that he was a common secondary actor in westerns and had never used his singing capabilities before The Music Man.I know of many well- educated Marian Librarians who need Professors like Harold to show them that they are special and better than any other kind of company.  When Sirley Jones sings &quot;And if ocassionaly he'd ponder, what makes Shakespeare and Beetoven great, him I could love till I died.&quot;  My liberal arts mind melts into putty.The movie never looses the touch that the original cast had to the play.  The reason is because the director, Da Costa, was the director of the play on Broadway as well as the film.  The scenes and lighting move allong in the film as they would on a stage.  Most of the scenes, for example, are concluded by a shillouette light on a main character that fades.  The choreography of the dance scenes are spectacular, and very well constructed, like you would expect them to be on a stage.The DVD comes with a lot of great extra material.  Shirley Jones is the narrator of two doccumentaries.  Much behind the scenes infromation is unvieled in these doccumentaries.  A feature that I use a lot is the English subtitles, which are placed in the black part of the screen so you can easilly sing allong to the wide array of songs.  There are the usual talent files, original trailers, and more.  For any fan of musicals, the doccumentaries are a treat all by themselves.I have not focused  a lot on the story of the movie, because I suspect you have already seen this classic film or have heard of the play.  If you have not seen or heard of the play, I won't tell you the story anyway, you have to see it for yourself.  Believe me, it's worth it.  Before you know it, you will be singing &quot;76 trombones&quot; to your hearts delight.

After the first 30-40 minutes of watching this boss abuse everyone, I wanted to stop watching, but I decided to suffer through to the end to see what the point is.  Truthfully there IS no point, other than the horrible way people treat each other, and it doesn't end good. There is no redemption, and it's obvious that the abuse will continue. Absolutely terrible.  And God help us if this is an accurate portrayal of the movie business!!

$review_text.: A dark tale based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, one of America's first female serial killers. Wuornos had a difficult and cruel childhood plagued by abuse and drug use in Michigan. She became a prostitute by the age of thirteen, the same year she became pregnant. She eventually moved to Florida where she began earning a living as a highway prostitute--servicing the desires of semi-truck drivers. The tale focuses on the nine month period between 1989 and 1990, during which Wuornos had a lesbian relationship with a woman named Selby. And during that very same time, she also began murdering her clientele in order to get money without using sex. This turned the tables on a rather common phenomena of female highway prostitutes being the victims of serial killers--instead Wuornos, herself, carried out the deeds of a cold-blooded killer. Charlize Theron's performance in this movie is so incredible. It is a sad and moving movie. Never have I felt so disturbed yet riveted by a movie such as this one.

$review_text.: &quot;The War Room&quot; is an interesting documentary that shows you just exactly what goes on behind the scenes of a presidential campaign and all of the problems that can arise.  Mostly centered around the Clinton campaign, we get a look at a man who is determined to be the next President of the United States.  James Carville and George Stephanopoulos are the main brains behind the campaign, and they show it with their rapid thinking and reactions.  The road to the White House proves to be a bumpy one for Clinton and company, as scandals surface and tabloid articles flood the newsstands.  The people behind the campaign of Bill Clinton never get a break as they always have to be on their toes and figure out damage control.  Even though you know how it all ends, it is still a tense and shocking film.What I love the most about this documentary is that there is no overall narrator, and there really isn't an agenda to it.  The film doesn't force-feed you a likable Clinton.  The film's real purpose is to show you what happens during these campaigns.  Even though it's centered around Clinton, this film really could've been about anyone.  The film doesn't sugarcoat anything as it gives you the raw footage and shows you how both sides can play dirty.  It was amazing to watch Carville and Stephanopoulos work the way they did, as I had no idea how much of an important role they played in Clinton's campaign.I think this documentary can be enjoyed by anyone who is interested in how the system works.  You really don't even have to like Clinton in order to enjoy it, as the film isn't trying to make it look like Clinton is a saint or anything like that.  It is about how dirty people in these campaigns can fight, and it occurs on both sides.  And since there is no overall narrator, there is really nothing in here that tells you that you should feel a certain way about it all.  The DVD contains no special features, which is a shame.I really enjoyed &quot;The War Room,&quot; and I'm not a real big fan of politics.  I think it presents an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes.  If you're looking for an entertaining documentary that is funny and tense, then this is definitely something you should consider checking out.  A big triumph on all fronts, if you want my honest opinion. -Michael Crane

$REVIEW.: Black Death is an intriguing movie set in 1348 in England - and the black plague is wreaking havoc. Many of the medieval folk feel this disaster will destroy everyone if it's not somehow stopped.Black Death From a medieval person's point of view, they didn't know much about biology. When entire villages were wiped out by a mysterious, nasty disease, they thought it was either caused by witches or by an angry God. They flailed around trying to do something - anything - to get it to end.Into this mix comes a group of religious men. Osmund is a quiet monk who is torn by his love for a woman. He wants her to get somewhere safe from the plague. Ulric is a knight who's on a quest to examine a village which apparently is safe from the plague. Along with them go various other miscreants.The movie keeps you guessing. Are there supernatural elements? Is what they are seeing real? This is useful because it helps the viewer get into the mindset of medieval people. From their point of view, some elements of human biology *were* supernatural. I wasn't that fond of the ending, as I find it doesn't add to the story, but I'm sure others might find it fitting.They did a good job on the historical side. Not perfect, but then again most movies are far worse. The plague years were gritty, run down, rough, and full of intense emotion. People had no idea what to do. It seemed as if the world were about to end. The clothing and architecture is fairly accurate. So many movies make the middle ages seem like a eat-off-the-floor-clean wonderland. It wasn't. Especially not these years.Interestingly, for Game of Throne fans, both Sean Bean (Eddard Stark) and Carice van Houten (Melisandre) play key characters in this movie.Well recommended.

$REVIEW.: This is just a great production of The Six Wives of Henry VIII.  It was sensational in 1970 (in the US, 1972) and is sensational now.  The restoration is very good and I appreciate the work that went into it.  Some people may be put off by the videotape and stark lighting and contrasts but the BBC didn't have much money.  You can still see a bit of problem today with production values.  They just don't have as much money.What the BBC does have is dedication to quality shows, acting, writing and direction.  This show is beautifully written and acted at every turn.  The direction is fine also.  It is difficult to create a 90 minute production out of every wife Henry had.  All the wives get equal time here.  Catherine was Henry's wife for many years.  Instead of only showing the end of their marriage, the show also brings out what she went through before she married him.  He made her wait 7 years before he finally committed himself to marry her and she lived off of the dowry she was supposed to give him.  She couldn't leave because of the disgrace of being rejected.  Catherine was married to Henry's brother but he died shortly after at age 15.  Anne, the most pivotal marriage is picked up after the wedding.  The marriage ultimately lasted only two and a half years.  Jane lasted a year and the episode about her is very poignant since she died giving birth to a son for him.  Anne of Cleves was a washout.  He married her for only 5 months and she was lucky to escape with her head and volunteered to take care of his children.  Catherine got her head chopped off, her cousin was Anne Boleyn, didn't she think?  Catherine Parr could have got her head chopped for conflicts with religion.  She was lucky.  All the wives get 90 minutes and their stories are quite interesting.  Watch!

It was in no way disrespectful of our beloved 16th President, and it stayed true to history, as far as Abe's history is known, and I enjoyed every page of it.  Consequently, when I learned that a movie had been made of the novel, I was immediately interested.  I pre-ordered it, from Amazon, and waited.  When finally it was released, I couldn't wait to see it.  Well, the movie did not disappoint!!!  One added thing; my wife really liked it, too, and she's very hard to please.  I would unhesitatingly recommend this book to everyone.  The CGI is great, and the action is non-stop.  Plus, Rufus Sewell is a great bad guy.  'Nuf said!  Buy this movie!!!

$review_text.: This film is funny and a comment on the changing face of England in the 1970s. There have been accusations that the film is racist in its portrayal of the South Asians depicted in it, but why has nobody ever taken the negative portrayal of the English into account? As somebody of British descent, I could be just as easily offended by the stereotype of the English people as crass, ignorant and racist, but I recognize that, in this story, there is a degree of truth(I'm left with the impression that many of the people I've discussed the film with don't get the Enoch Powell reference). And I think if we get offended, we miss the point. When I saw the film, my impression was that its theme was the dangers of forcing your children to be something that they are not and the pitfalls of clinging to your past. Both the Pakistani and English characters in this film are guilty of that. I think this film has a valid message that everyone, regardless of their ethnic origin, can share.

He really seems to connect with the audience and brings out his own poeticness in his rendition of the songs. What an awesome performer. They are all having a great time and loving it and you can see it in this dvd. I have always loved the doors and the cult and when I found out Ian Astbury was doing this just recently, I had to see what it was like. And, I was very pleasantly surprised. They couldn't have made a better choice than Ian Astbury. Ray and Robbie are awesome too and are obviously enjoying themselves; and I think Robbie looks great in his military fatigues? He's really on with his guitar playing as well. I liked the interview clips in between the songs as well. We all love and miss Jim Morrison. He was one of  the great ones and his legacy will live on. And, we can still enjoy listening to his music and the music of the Doors. But, I believe Jim would love that Ray and Robbie are still out there performing their music and would love that one of their admirers/fans, Ian Astbury, is singing his songs with such feeling, and doing an amazing job of it.

However, the 2nd season seems to be lacking a considerable amount of budget money as the camera filming is atrocious. I think Discovery already knew after season 1 they were in trouble and did not put any money into this season. In addition, there was poor character building and considering a few of the men were repeats from last season, they should have focused on other climbers, not the ones who failed to make the top last year.

$REVIEW.: I remember first seeing this film as a young teenager on the late show.  I'm so glad it has been released on DVD.  I won't go into specifics on the story because that has been done by previous reviewers.  What I will say is that the DVD transfer is excellent....both sight and sound.  Stanwyck was positively the greatest actress of her generation and possibly the greatest actress of all time.  So honest, sincere and talented.  This film shows her at the peak of her craft....a true artist.  The story is engaging and keeps you in suspense from the first moment to the last.  Not one wasted reel.  Directed by Mitchell Leisen, it is film noir at its best.  The interesting thing about this film is that Stanwyck did all her stunts in the train wreck scene, along with Phyllis Thaxter.  Jane Cowl is deliciously sympathetic as the grandmother.  Lyle Bettger is a true menace and John Lund, though bland, is made to look good by Stanwyck.  This is one of her best!!
$SUMMARY.: Stanwyck was the Greatest!

$review_text.: This is a brilliant film. It starts right out of the blocks, with Fred's tap barrages disturbing Ginger's sleep...and logically moves into the great comedy of the buggy scene...and the thrill of the pavilion dance in the rain. The first 25 minutes are beyond the pale of criticism...It is PERFECT....and it's pretty rare to employ that word.I think it drags just a little in the middle...until the climax of the great, evocative, and extremely graceful "Cheek to Cheek" song and dance. Punctuated by Fred getting slapped.As their first original script for them, it's an example of the "integrated" musical. But what is interesting still today, is that it is not overly integrated. There's something lost, imho, when too much integration makes the numbers too flat with the plot...so there is no anticipation, and no high points, no low points...making the plot dominate over the brilliance, and often...as in this film...the incredibly rich nuance of their dancing...supported by one of the greatest music scores of all time, by Irving Berlin.The end of the film is also quite rightly capped by a brilliant dance of joy and celebration..."The Piccolino". It just doesn't get any better than this...at least until "Let's Face the Music and Dance"...and of course, the even greater...to many viewers..."Swing Time".Generations of audiences, way into the far future, will be delighted with the sparkling intelligence that went into the creation of this timeless film.

$REVIEW.: Mike Hammer is transplanted to the left coast in this overrated but entertaining cult classic.  Rather than being a two-fisted gumshoe, here Mike does sleazy divorce work and practically pimps out Velda.  The picture starts off strong, but sinks into a very convoluted plot.  The thrills come from the ahead-of-it's-time violence -- some of the most sadistic of which is handed out by Hammer.  The picture also takes the cynisism of 50s noir and extends that to the political climate with it's much vaunted apocalyptic ending.  This seems to lay the groundwork for 70s thrillers like Parallax View and Three Days of the Condor with their paranoia and suspicion.Meeker's okay, but the picture might play better if the other women were as good as Cloris Leachman in the opening scenes.

$REVIEW.: A good movie, not great, that garnered tremendous support at the pinnacle of the Vietnam War, as a type of returning to reality, American style. A large segment of the population was fed up with war movies, "Easy Riders", "Midnight Cowboys" et al and naturally radiated to Erich Segal's simple novel transformed into a simple film. They got their money's worth. Crowds openly hissed and booed Milland's every move, a sure sign of his commendable performance as the bossy, conceited establishment figure. O'Neal's hatred of him could be felt right through the screen.Macgraw gives an uneven performance; one is often at a loss as to whether her attempts at one-upsmanship over O'Neal are reality or teasing. Whatever, the couple is apparently truly in love as the bedroom scenes (tastefully done) seem to indicate. The ending seems to convey the couple's atheism; a truly loving God would allow this to happen? In summation, this is a timeless movie, well worth your attention.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed this movie
It was definitely an improvement from the movie version of "I Can Do Bad All By Myself", however I did feel somewhat disappointed when I left the theatre.There were two things I didn't like about the movie
The first one is Troy's storyline (Sheila's husband) about being unemployed was too similar to the Lem character in "Soul Food" and the second thing I didn't like was the ending.I don't want to give the movie away for those of you who haven't seen it yet, so I'll just say the wrong character was chosen for that particular scene

Maybe after you've seen it, you'll agree

Maybe, you won't but I've dealt with something similar and it takes a lot longer than a year to bounce back from that.I do know that all movies don't have a happy ending but that whole scene should have been re-written so that the movie could have ended on a high note.Overall, it was a very entertaining movie and I enjoyed it

I just didn't like the ending, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5

Also, Janet Jackson acted her heiny off
She has definitely come a long way from "Poetic Justice." All of them did a great job acting but Janet was the centerpiece
Hats off to you, Janet!Keep up the good work, Tyler! Still a fan and still in your corner.

$REVIEW.: Masters of Science Fiction: The Complete SeriesThis was surprisingly a pretty good short-lived series that came out last summer (summer of '2007) on ABC...and amazingly good talent such as Sam Waterson, Brian Dennehy, John Hurt, Terry O'Quinn, Anne Heche, Malcolm McDowell and Sean Astin. Just a bit frustrating that ABC like many networks just don't give science fiction much of a chance to really succeed and build an audience, of course it's not going to do well during summer evenings, because that when most of your potential audience is out of the house and not watching TV. Anyway, to science-fiction fans, this is a must-see. But I also encourage casual fans who love good acting and writing to check this out.

$REVIEW.: Dear god where do I begin?This film had so much potential. Uschi Obermaier is a former fashion model, actress and one of the protagonists of the 1968 left-wing movement in Germany. She is considered an iconic sex symbol. She also wrote an autobiography of her wild life called Das Wilde Leben which was a best seller.This film was *suppose* to be based on her book. Some parts are some aren't. For starters I think they did a terrible job picking the actress to play Uschi. The girl looks nothing like the real Uschi Obermaier. The real Uschi Obermaier was so gorgeous it hurt to look at her. To know what I mean, google her name and look under images. Natalia Avelon is pretty but she is all "makeup pretty". No natural beauty like Uschi Obermaier. Another thing is the badly done chronological order. "Uschi" looked exactly the same from 1968 all the way through 1983.All in all, just rent this movie. If you're a guy you might like the film a lot since "Uschi" is naked 90% of the time she's on screen.Also they left out the music video of Summer Wine starring Ville Valo and Natalia. Very very stupid thing to do seeing that was the best thing about the film. The song.

$REVIEW.: I'm a big fan of "Family Guy" and Seth MacFarlane but I generally don't like movies with humans and uh...stuffed animals who can talk.  In this film, also written by MacFarlane, young John Bennett gets an oversized Teddy bear for Christmas.  John is even less popular than the Jewish kids who are beaten up each year by the Christian kids.  He wishes his Teddy would become human and be his lifelong friend.  Bang!  It happens and the two form a bond.Years later as a 35 year old desk clerk for a car rental agency, John still has kid-like tendencies but for his 4 year relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis).  Lori puts an ultimatum to John.  Rambunctious, profane Ted must get his own apartment or she will move on.  This of course doesn't sit well with Ted who enjoys his pot smoking time with John.  Ted (MacFarlane) enjoys the best lines and while they aren't consistent, some are damn funny.  MacFarlane's humor is fast and he doesn't give you much time to absorb it before moving on to the next joke.  I also suspect many of quick hits will sail over some people's heads.Joel McHale and Giovanni Ribisi are along for the ride as foils for John and Ted.  Sam Jones enlivens a party at Ted's pad.  He of course is from John and Ted's favorite movie "Flash Gordon" from 1980.  The bit is funny with some recreated scenes from the film.  Also look for Patrick Warburton and Ryan Reynolds in a hilarious brief cameo.  Finally, Norah Jones, playing herself, helps Ted and John try to mend fences with Lori in a scene you won't believe.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this
 I recently saw &#34;The Mathew Sheppard Story&#34; and also bought this item because Amazon recommended it (buy together and save.)  It was indeed a wonderful project about a heinous hate crime


 I'm glad so many big/semi-big stars, many of whom have Emmys and Golden Globes and are Hollywood veterans, pulled together to lend their talents to this very special production


 I know the Sheppard homicide was a long time ago now and even this tribute movie was done more than a decade ago.However, it is important that it stays out there and keeps being watched

 Hopefully it has gotten more people thinking about sexual equality and obliterating homophobia

 It's time for it all to end...it won't be gone within my lifetime, I'm sure


 But maybe in 100 years it will be, and that would be incredible.

$review_text.: I originally saw this film in the theatre, and after having bought this particular package, I have to say it's a much better movie with the extra footage.If you watch the both versions back to back, the omissions are glaring in the theatrical cut
 The film would likely have garnered more Oscars than nominations had this footage been in the theatrical release.No matter, for those of us who have a love-hate relationship with the DVD industry, this is one director's cut that justifies the format in every single way

 Oh, did I mention the performances?From top to bottom, everything about this movie is perfect
 From the casting to the editing, from the music selection to the writing, there isn't a weak link in the chain
 Cameron Crowe seemingly goes from strength to strength, and this film represents the pinnacle of his life as a filmmaker.Although I grew up with a big crush on Drew Barrymore, I have to say that Kate Hudson (at least in this role) was MADE for the big screen
 Hopefully she'll get more dramatic parts, but I have a feeling this will be the crowning gem in her career


 She's absolutely luminous, and has you alternately saddened and infatuated at various times throughout the movie.Frances McDormand is also stellar in her supporting role; she gets the biggest laughs
 Just when I thought Crowe wouldn't be able to top "Say Anything", he pulls this one out of thin air


 Stunning.

$review_text.: This review petrains to the anime as a whole. I cannot review this set as it has not been released at the time of this review.This series bassed on the manga by Rikudou Koshi is in my opinion a classic that all manga/anime fans should own along with the originol manga (at the time of this review their are 22 volumes of the manga).This series follow two teenage girls just out of high school, Excel Excel and Hyatt, who are members of a secreet organization ACROSS (named after a center in fukkuoka in Southern Japan) headed by Lord Ilpallazo (the Ilpalazo is a trendy hotel in Japan) intent on domination. They decide to foucuss their efforts on taking over a city, F-City (I assume refers to Fukuokka) as a step to world domination.It is loaded with parodies of Japanese manga and anime as well as parodies of american movies and comics.It is an extreamly hillarious comdey spanning 26 eppisodes.In my opinion any one who is a fan of manga or anime should own both this anime and the manga. The manga in my opinion is even better and has a different story and more characters, though the anime also has originol characters.

$review_text.: In this comic Western, Melody Jones (Gary Cooper) and his crusty sidekick George Fury (William Demarest) happen into the Southwestern town of Payneville and into the tangle of their lives.  Melody, it seems, bears a superficial resemblance to an infamous son of the region, one Monte Jarrod (Dan Duryea), who not only killed two members of a powerful local family some years earlier (preciptating his abrupt departure from the locality), but has recently returned and held up a stagecoach for some $40,000.  Between the outraged Cotton family, the sheriff and his posse, the Fargo agent trying to recover the stolen money, various amateur bounty hunters looking to cash in on the bounty offered for Monte, and Monte's boyhood sweetheart, Cherry deLongpre (Loretta Young), who inexplicably makes up her mind to get Melody out of town before someone shoots him in the back, Payneville and its environs are not a healthy place for the two partners to be.  That Melody is as inept with a gun as anyone you'd care to meet, and Monte is both vicious and ruthless, doesn't help.  But Melody discovers that he doesn't like to be used and manipulated, and in the process he finds out some important things about himself and Cherry.Cooper spoofs his "strong-and-silent" archetype with unexpected skill (it might be worth keeping in mind that he played in several "drawing-room" or "screwball" comedies during his glory days in the 1930's), although the extensive use of back-projection and sound-stage "exteriors" is distracting.  Demarest provides excellent comic relief, Duryea is at his usual psychotic best, and there's a good bit of steadily-increasing tension too.  This is one of my favorite light Westerns and one I was delighted to find on DVD.

They remind her of home, so not a week goes by that something Australian isn't playing on our TV. This week, it was Tomorrow, when the war began.Normally, I am not a fan of Australian movies, however this one was different. It had good acting, and great special effects, which is in my opinion, unique for Aussie movies.The movie played out quite similar to Red Dawn, and if you are a red dawn fan, you most likely will enjoy the film. Like Red Dawn, some level of suspension of disbelief is required, however overall the film is extremely entertaining. The variety of character archetypes is well balanced.Not the best film i've watched lately, but is one of the better films, an definitely is the best Australian film i've ever seen. In fact, this movie has made me seek out the book, as well as Marsden other books. Yea, it's that good.

$REVIEW.: The Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection is six hours and fifty - four minutes and was released on DVD on November 9, 2004. In this collection you have the first five Marx Brothers movies; if you don't include Humor Risk. In this collection you have Chico, Harpo, Groucho and Zeppo. Zeppo would leave the group after Duck soup and the brothers would become a trio. I would like to know the real truth why Zeppo left and not some crack pot fan excuse. In the Paramount Pictures collection the brothers just act zany with no real story behind it; Monkey Business is the best example. Starting with MGM the Marx Brothers start to help people. In this collection three of the films have trailers to them. The downsides to this collection are the book that comes with it. The book is glued in the case and you can't take it out and read it. Second it the Bonus Materials disc; basically you get three Today Show interviews with Harpo, Groucho, and Harpo's son William and that is all. In my opinion not much of a bonus. With some of the movies I wish they came with an audio commentary so one could learn something behind the making of the movie. The Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection is a great addition to any Marx Brothers fan and gets an AAAA++++.The Cocoanuts is one hour and thirty - three minutes and was release in theaters on May 3, 1929. The main plot is that Mrs. Potter valuable necklace is stolen and the wrong person is accused of the crime. The Marx Brothers clear his name and bring the two guilty people to justice. Actually only Harpo and Chico try to help clear Bob Adams name. That is basically the whole movie in a nutshell. Basically the Cocoanuts in the four Marx brothers acting zany throughout the movie. You have the famous "why a duck" scene with a lot of musical numbers thrown in. My favorite number is the Tale of the Shirt. Some footnotes about this picture are the Marx Brother were doing double duty, they were doing the Broadway version of Animal Crackers at night and in the early morning hours working on the Cocoanuts. Another thing is that Harpo's wig is much darker in this movie; in Animal Crackers and on he would wear a lighter color wig. Also in the stage version Chico and Harpo are giving names and in the movie version they have none. One final footnote is Zeppo gets first billing. Granted their names are left to right, but his is first. In the next four films the credits are as follows: Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo. The Cocoanuts is a good movie, but in my opinion not a great a movie. The Cocoanuts gets a B+.DVD EXTRASScenesLanguages* Spoken Languageo English* Captions & Subtitles for the Hearing Impairedo English* Subtitleso Espa&ntilde;olo Franaiso NonePlayAnimal Crackers is one hour and thirty - five minutes and was released in theaters on August 23, 1930. This is their second movie that was adapted from their play. Of the three Marx Brothers Broadway plays, I'll Say She Is, The Cocoanuts, and Animal Crackers, I'll Say She Is was the only one not made into a film. The film plot is that Captain Spaulding has come back from an expedition in Africa and Mrs. Rittenhouse is throwing him a return party and presenting Captain Spaulding with a painting. The painting getting stolen and the rest of the movie is trying to find the painting with mini subplots in the movie. Some lines from the original play were cut out and the only downside to this movie is the ending. Animal Crackers is a little bit better than The Cocoanuts.

Basically the four brothers are stowaways on a ship and get mixed up with Mafia bosses. Groucho and Zeppo get mixed up with one of the Mafia bosses and Chico and Harpo become body guards for another. That is the basic storyline; during the rest of the film it is the Marx Brothers being their zany selves. This movie has a few firsts in it. This the first movie that was actually written for the brothers. The last two films were adaptations from their Broadway plays. Also this is one of the few times that Margaret Dumont is not in a Marx Brother movie. Though he sang in the last two movies, Groucho does not sing in this movie accept when he is hidden in the barrel early in the movie singing Sweet Adeline with his brothers. Zeppo gets more screen time but few scenes where he actually speaks, however he does get to play the hero at the end of the movie. With this movie there is an ongoing debate whether or not Harpo joined his other three brothers singing Sweet Adeline in the barrel scene since all four were hidden in the barrels at the time they were singing the song. Also Zeppo finds Maurice Chevalier passport and all four Marx Brothers sing You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me. When it is Harpo turns to sing You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me, he uses a mini phonograph and it Harpo's voice or Maurice Chevalier singing the song. Monkey Business gets an AA++ for being zany.DVD EXTRASScenesLanguages* Spoken Languageso Englisho Espa&ntilde;ol* Captions & Subtitles for the Hearing Impairedo English* Subtitleso Espa&ntilde;olo Franaiso NonePlayHorse Feathers is one hour and six minutes and was released in theaters on August 10, 1932. Basically Groucho, Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff, is the new president of Huxley and his son Frank Wagstaff, Zeppo, convinces him that what the college needs is a strong football team. Professor Wagstaff goes to a speakeasy and recruit the wrong guys. He winds up with Pinky (Harpo) and Baravelli (Chico). The best thing about this movie are the plays called by Baravelli, an example is: Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Professor Wagstaff gets the ball. Of all the Marx Brothers movies and that include those made after Zeppo left the group, this is the shortest movie of them all. Also this was Thelma Todd last movie with the Marx Brothers. Starting with Duck Soup and continuing to the Big Store, Margaret Dumont would be Groucho woman. This is a movie that was almost not made, Chico was in a car accident and production was halted for two months and Zeppo was already thinking about leaving the group. In this movie he was giving a bigger part to convince him to stay. Zeppo hung around for one more movie. Horse Feathers gets an AAA+++.DVD EXTRASScenesTrailerLanguages* Spoken Languageso Englisho Espa&ntilde;ol* Captions & Subtitles for the Hearing Impairedo English* Subtitleso Espa&ntilde;olo Franaiso NonePlayDuck Soup is one hour and eight minutes and was released in theaters on November 17, 1933. The main story is Rufus T. Firefly, played by Groucho Marx) takes over a bankrupt country called Freedonia and in the end has it going to war with its neighboring country Sylvania. Some facts about this movie are this would be Zeppo's last movie with his brothers and this would be the last movie the Marx Brothers would make with Paramount Pictures. Duck Soup did so poorly at the box office that Paramount released them from their contract. Some good laugh scenes are the motorcycle and side car. Each time Rufus tries to go somewhere Harpo leaves him stranded. In the last one where Harpo drives off in the sidecar and Groucho gets left behind on a stalled motorcycle he quips this is the only way to travel. Also you have the famous mirror scene in it as well. By the way some info about the title, Duck Soup is slang for something easy to do.

Tom Baker is still of my  favorite actors to play Doctor Who! Too bad they have not released the  rest of his stories to video!

$review_text.: I think this could have been a much better movie

 Robin Williams and the supporting actors Diane Lane, Brian Kerwin, Fran Drescher, Jennifer Lopez and Bill Crosby are capable of much better acting and deserve a MUCH better script and directing
 Mostly, Robin Williams seemed kind of creepy and so did Bill Cosby

 We did not find this to be a funny movie and were glad when it ended

 Big disappointment...

$REVIEW.: As a fan of the first two 'Wrong Turn' films, especially the first, 'Wrong Turn 3' is absolutely terrible and one of the worst sequels of the year
This film should have never have been a part of the series, as it feels nothing like a 'Wrong Turn' film


Well, apart from the presence of Three-Finger - but then again, he's barely in the film.The script is awful and the whole prisoners aspect just didn't work for this film
All of the prisoners were unlikeable and stereotypical, with very little development
The lead girl was not lead girl material, and was either screaming, crying or standing in the background doing nothing

The dialog, especially in the opening scene, is so god-awful I wanted to hit mute
The acting ranges from horrific to bearable, with no memorable performances

Most of the actors are Brits playing Americans, and most of them keep slipping in and out of their accents.There are no memorable horror sequences and absolutely no tension
Every character either steps into a trap, gets killed off-screen or is CGI'd with incredibly fake blood splatter

The film reeks of 'SyFy channel', which isn't surprising considering the director, Declan O'Brien, has an entire resume of SyFy productions and the same production services were used
Whether it's the cheesy 'TV movie' soundtrack playing constantly or the horrific CGI and green screen backdrops, it's really horrible to look at and makes 'WT2' look a blockbuster.Where did it all go wrong? Wrong Turn 2 is one of the most well-received horror films of 2007 and one of the best DTV horror entries available


It received tons of praise from horror critics and fans, and I loved it


You'd think the series could only get better, but instead they give us this piece of sh-t? I know the trailer looked lame as hell, but I still wasn't expecting a terrible film.The only worthy aspect of the film is the presence of Three-Finger and the fact the movie takes place on night, which was the main weak point of WT2
Everything else is a very low-budget SyFy channel flick merely posing as a sequel to what was once a great series

Prepare to be disappointed if you are a fan of the series.2/5

$REVIEW.: You've heard about southern prejudice where humans are hunted for sport. Ernest Dickerson does a good job of balancing his cast where he establishes that this story is not about white on black crime. Ice T is a transvient  who becomes convinced by Charles Dutton to accept an offer to go hunting.  After being flown to a remote cabin in the woods, T finds out that he is  the one being hunted the next morning. Ice T is convincing but works little  on dialogue to make his character likeable and Dutton is so likeable that  he fools everybody. The setup is too confusing. Not until Gary Buseys  dinner speech do we feel something is about to happen. Ice T could've been  less hardened at first making his heroic chracter more likeable. The  scenery is beautiful and editing well done. Good performances by some great  actors like Gary Busey and F Murray Abraham. This adventure into the dark  side of the human mind is very predictable with some minor surprises. Not  executed well enough to be for everybody. If you like psychologcal  thrillers, you'll accept the movies shortcomings. Ice T as well as many  actors from hip hop need to work on they're three dimensions of character.  To Ice T's credit though he's good at geting the bad guys!

$REVIEW.: I personally think this film is underrated, compared to all the praise Argento's Suspiria receives

That's also a great film, but Tenebrae is often overlooked

The story is about a horror novelist who travels to Italy to promote his new book, called Tenebrae


Soon, some murders start happening that link the author to the crimes
The usual giallo business, yes, but this film is different


It contains some of the most powerful scenes Argento has ever filmed


Not to mention a huge body count


About 20 minutes into the film there's a very haunting flashback that gives me chills every time I see it

It's a beautiful scene

Some other highlights include the infamous (and very gory) arm-chopping and the extremly tense scene of a girl being chased by a vicious dog

Some parts are silly, and the ending is a bit confusing, but I still consider this a classic, and one you shouldn't miss.

$review_text.: For the record - I am a HUGE Hunger Games fan and have been of the books for over 2 years


Please do not read this as a rant, but rather a fans opinion.This movie is garbage in the representation of the books
It was created specifically with Twilight fan-girls in mind
The first chunk of the movie is very, very slow and does not explain anything well

If you did not read the book (or books, actually, as the movie jumps a bit ahead on features), I cannot see something really understanding what is going on


At the very least, the true meaning from the book is lost."HEY! Movies can't be exactly like the books!" you may say
Yes, I agree with this but to a point

The books revolve around the main fact: the Capital forces two children from each district to brutally murder each other to survive
The film makers took this and decided - for the young children audience - that the kids would fluff each other to death

Deaths magically become fuzzy or shaky, with music or odd sound overlayed to the scene.I went to see this movie opening night at a nice theater - it cost me about $20 a reserved seat which I purchased first available day


It was packed 90% with teenage girls who screamed over the barely-there deaths and gasped out loud over the kiss which, if you read the book, is not a "real" kiss
Before the movie 12 year old girls were running around yelling "TEAM PEETA!".Greed took advantage of what had amazing potential


Money was the key factor - young girls will be running out to buy the "team" shirts and action figure toys


A rated R movie would have been true to the story, but would generate a mere fraction in sales.

$REVIEW.: From 1963, Doris Day stars as a woman returning home five years after being stranded on an island and presumed dead in a plane crash. She arrives in America to find that her children don't recognize her and her husband has just declared her legally dead, clearing him to marry the vapid but beautiful Bianca. The film was originally intended as a Marilyn Monroe vehicle, but was rewritten for Doris Day after Marilyn Monroe's untimely death. This is a silly movie where the viewer is to expect James Garner to be insanely jealous because his wife was stranded on an island with another man after a plane crash. In this movie, Doris Day is stunningly beautiful and in her prime as an actress.Comedy (AMC 331/1)

$review_text.: As a hardcore Futurama fan I enjoyed Bender's Game even though it does not measure up to the very best of Futurama
 While there are times when the storyline drags, there are lots of funny "bits," with nods to numerous SF and fantasy movies/shows, along with moments that hark back to episodes in the Futurama TV series
The quality of the artwork is noticeably better than it was in the original series, and the DVD includes a good selection of extras

Overall, Bender's Game is a worthy addition to the series


(BTW: While the movie's title is a play on Ender's Game, it has nothing to do with that classic science fiction novel.)

$review_text.: Get the hook! Get the hook! When "Hook" came out the buzz was that is was a sub par performance from director Steven Spielberg--an epic flop--but my niece said it was really good, so I gave it a spin. My verdict was that it was pretty good and I enjoyed it. Why did the public stay home in droves?Spielberg's appeal has been and continues to be that he maintains his connection to his inner child. Kids like dinosaurs. So he makes a movie about dinosaurs. Huge blockbuster. Sometimes he manipulates his audience--and the audience is only too happy to be manipulated--until they become aware that the director is manipulating them, and he knows he is manipulating them, and he might also be laughing at them, and how easy they can be manipulated. How dare he? Backlash.Hook, and the whole Neverland, Peter Pan, franchise is all about getting in touch with your inner child. If you believe and think your happy thought, then you can fly! It would seem to be a perfect fit for Spielberg, but it exposes his method. Even Hook knows that he is just a character in a story. During a fight he tells Peter Pan that he is going to wake up and realize that it was all a dream. While watching "Hook" the audience realizes that they are being Spielberged, making it harder and harder to hold on to that happy thought. I just made up that word, "Spielberged" by the way, but I am sure you know exactly what I am talking about.There was also a backlash against Robin Williams underway at that time that may have contributed to the film's cold reception. Perhaps it was Patch Adams that drove people over the edge, but Williams had taken on too many cute roles and his appeal was starting to grow thin. Since that time he has declared Death to Smoochy and tried for edgier roles. If anyone saw him in "What Dreams May Come" they might notice that it bears a lot of similarity with "Hook" in that it is rumination on the power of dreams and the imagination, but it is balanced with a darker side. One Hour Photo is perhaps his edgiest role to date, but take August Rush for an example. He plays a Fagin-like character who tries to exploit the musical talent of the lost boys he finds. He has a bit of the Robin Williams whimsy we've all seen in him since the days of Mork and Mindy, but it is balanced by his sinister side, so his character never becomes cloying and overly sentimental. Williams has been trying to find that blend of dark and light with varying degrees of success. I think he got it in "Hook" but at the time people were either sick of the too-cute Robin, or not ready for the dark side to be revealed.---------------Peter Banning: You're not old enough to shave! What are you doing with a sword? I've been flying around - This is an insurance nightmare! What is this? Some sort of the "Lord of the Flies" pre-school? Where are your parents? Who's in charge here?=====================Once the backlash started, it only picked up momentum with rumors that Julia Roberts--who does she think she is?--as Tinkerbelle was nicknamed 'Tinkerhell' because she was so difficult on the set. Since she spent so much of her screen time hoisted aloft on wires she had a person whose sole job it was to make sure her feet were always clean. Tinkerbelle had a sublet apartment in an empty cuckoo clock and there was a gold MasterCard (or was it Visa?) sitting behind her on an easel. It was kind of cute, in a Spielbergian way, showing how tiny she was, but it was like putting a commercial right smack dab in the movie. Product placement gone amuck. And some people might not want to see a full-sized Tinkerbelle smooching Robin Williams, even if this was a movie about what happens when Peter Pan grows up.Bottom line is "Hook" is a very entertaining film with great performances by Dustin Hoffman, as title character Captain James Hook; Robin Williams, as Peter Pan/Banning; Bob Hoskins as First Mate Smee; Maggie Smith, Charlie Korsmo, and the lovely Julia Roberts as Tinkerbelle. It stays true to the original J.M. Barrie material while asking the question: what would happen if Peter did grow up? It was unjustly maligned, but if you keep an open mind perhaps you'll find that you do believe in fairies after all. Kids will enjoy it but there is something for grown ups to think about, too. Watch for cameo performances by Glenn Close, Carrie Fisher, Gwyneth Paltrow, David Crosby, Jimmy Buffet, George Lucas, Phil Collins, and also from the band called Genesis: Mike Rutherford, and Tony Banks. The cast and crew all seemed to be having a great time, even bringing their kids, some of whom also appear in Hook. At one point a complicated scene had to be cut, but Bob Hoskins bought a round of beer for 300 + extras out of his own pocket. With all the fun that went into this film, you can't help but have a little fun watching it.----------Smee: I've just had an apostrophe.Captain Hook: I think you mean an epiphany.Smee: [gestures his fingers to his head] Lightning has just struck my brain.Captain Hook: Well, that must hurt.=================August Rush(2007) Robin Williams was Maxwell 'Wizard' WallaceCloser (Superbit Edition)(2004) Julia Roberts was AnnaThe Chumscrubber(2005) Caroline Goodall was Mrs. ParkerMona Lisa Smile(2003) Julia Roberts was Katherine Ann WatsonCan't Hardly Wait(1998) Charlie Korsmo was WilliamDick Tracy(1990) Dustin Hoffman was Mumbles and Charlie Korsmo was KidMona Lisa(1986) Bob Hoskins was GeorgeMidnight Cowboy(1969) Dustin Hoffman was RatsoThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie(1969) Maggie Smith was Jean BrodieThe Graduate(1967) Dustin Hoffman was Ben Braddock------------Tinkerbelle: That's right, Peter, second star to the right and straight on till morning.=================

I have watched it ever since I was a girl and have thrilled all over with the mystery and wonder that comes from this great Alfred Hitchcock film. It was one of his very best ever made.

I could think of no better pair to execute this story than Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. There is nothing better than the original, and Hitchcock was the original master of suspense in hollywood!

$review_text.: In 2008, the Dutch war film "Oorlogswinter" (Winter in Wartime), an adaptation of the popular 1972 Dutch novel by Jan Terlouw is directed by Martin Koolhoven ("Suzy Q", "AmnesiA", "Het Schnitzelparidjs")  became one of Netherlands top grossing films.Winning multiple awards and receiving rave reviews from critics worldwide, "Winter in Wartime" finally receives its long-awaited Blu-ray and DVD release (via a Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack) in America courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics in July 2011.The film would introduce young actor Martijn Lakemeier ("Lover and Loser", "Sonny Boy") and stars Yorick van Wageningen ("The Chronicles of Riddick", "The New World", "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"), Melody Klaver ("Dusk", "Doors") and Jamie Campbell Bower ("The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn", "New Moon, "Camelot").To help people understand what "Winter in Wartime" is about, first I must explain the context of where Netherlands was back during World War II.As a neutral country during both World Wars, in 1940, the country was invaded by Nazi Germany.  While the Dutch were able to fight off the Germans, during a time with negotiations between the Dutch and Germans, miscommunication by the Germans led to the accidental bombing of Rotterdam where 950 civilians were killed and the area was devastated.  The Germans used the incident as a way to make the Netherlands surrender and eventually, the Dutch surrendered.During Germany's occupation of Netherlands, the Netherlands was controlled by a German civilian governor and Germany tried to make the country to an Aryan nation and Jews in the country were persecuted, socialists were imprisoned and Roman Catholic priests were deported to concentration camps.Meanwhile, civilians were forced into labor at German factories and food and goods in Netherlands were scarce. So, many Dutch had hatred towards the Germans, a few collaborated with them.Many people were driven away from their homes and because the Germans blocked food and fuel shipments from farm areas, many people starved and people died from "The Dutch famine of 1944'."Oorlogswinter" (Winter in Wartime) is a film about innocence lost because of the war.VIDEO:"Winter in Wartime" is a film that is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and the cinematography by Guido van Gennep is wonderful.  One of the goals by Martin Koolhoven was to make people feel that they were in the area while watching the film.  Capturing the frigid cold winter in the Netherlands and the cinematography is just beautiful as it showcases the arctic environment but also in HD, showcasing the amazing detail of the clothing, the bark on the trees and also capturing the emotions of the family.It's a film that was well-planned for its sequence and I have to agree with many film critics, "Winter in Wartime" is wonderfully crafted and looks absolutely great on Blu-ray!  I saw no banding, no artifacting, no speckles or dirt or any problems at all.  The picture quality is wonderful!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:"Winter in Wartime" is presented in Dutch and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  While the film is crystal clear in dialogue, there are some scenes where surround sound usage is well-done, a few scenes with LFE usage as well but it's important to note that the film is primarily dialogue and ambiance driven.There are scenes where you hear the Germans on their motorcycles, the squeaks of Michiel riding his bike, a scene where the ice beneath the bike breaks and shatters and several moments of gunshots and one major plane explosion.  For the most part, this is not a war film in the sense where there is constant action but a war film that focuses on its dramatic elements.SPECIAL FEATURES:"Winter in Wartime" comes with the following special features:The Making of Winter in Wartime - (24:24) An interview with director Martin Koolhoven and the cast of "Winter in Wartime" about their involvement in the film and their thoughts of their character and scenes in the film.Theatrical Trailer - The original theatrical trailer of "Winter in Wartime.EXTRAS:"Winter in Wartime" on Blu-ray also comes with a DVD version of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:"Winter in Wartime" is a powerful film that features beautiful cinematography and a wonderful performance from the young Martijn Lakemeier!When it comes to World War II-era films that are about children, standout films that come to mind are Mike Herman's 1998 film "The Boy in Striped Pajamas" and also Roberto Rosselini's 1948 "Germany, Year Zero" to name a few.  While the efficacy of both films is the fact that they are though-provoking, especially the latter which was shot not long after the war ended, Martin Koolhoven's "Winter in Wartime" gives us a perspective that we really don't see much of, what was happening to the young in Netherlands during German occupation.While Paul Verhoeven's 1977 film "Soldaat van Oranje" (Soldier of Orange) is a classic war film that takes place in the Netherlands and my favorite Netherlands World War II film out there, "Winter in Wartime" is one that tries to maintain the theme of lost innocence and betrayal.  Where "Soldier of Orange" focused on college-aged kids choosing their own path and direction, "Winter in Wartime" is a film in which a boy, can't understand this world around him and why the adults would try to make peace with the men who have brought suffering to his country.Too young to understand his father's delicate place in negotiations when it comes to the release of people who get into trouble in their town, but also a boy who looks to his Uncle Ben as the primary source of heroics.  But for those who follow history, especially in the Netherlands and knowing that like other countries who were faced with occupation, one had to make choices for survival.  Hold in your hatred towards the Germans and find a way to fight or join them and become a traitor to your own country and people for the sake of survival or other reasons.For Michiel, anyone who fights against the Germans are heroes to him.  Those who talk and laugh with them are not and thus the resentment he feels towards his father.There are images that we see throughout the film that capture the historical situations of Netherlands quite well.  From those who were forced out of their homes and must walk the frozen terrain looking for food but to see certain people with power who do try to work with the Germans, are in a much better position.Filmmaker Martin Koolhoven tries to capture those situations that he felt as a young boy growing up at that time and brings it to a new generation of audiences who are not familiar with the fears that existed at the time.  In "Winter of Wartime", the focus is on innocence and innocence lost.  Although young Michiel gets into trouble and his father has to bail him out, it's not because he's a bad kid but it's because he can't understand why people are to suffer because of the Germans and the fact that he is the mayor's son and never gets into trouble, makes him more confident in pulling off things because of his father's status.  And of course, when many fathers including Michiel's own father are taken as prisoner by the Germans, he quickly learns that his family is not immune and their status in the Netherlands can easily be taken away from them.The film works because of its great cinematography and its performances by its talents.  Primarily the work of main, young actor Martiijn Lakemeier.  To see the transformation of his character of Michiel from the beginning towards the end of the film was done quite well.But while a powerful film that is wonderfully crafted, features wonderful performances and has beautiful cinematography, there was one action scene in the film that pulled me out of the zone.  I just felt that the filmmakers tried to include an action sequence that felt out-of-place.  Something that would seem suitable for an "Indiana Jones" type of film and surprisingly, even actor Jamie Campbell Bower used "Indiana Jones" as a reference to the scene in the special feature included on the Blu-ray release.But aside from that one scene, the overall film was entertaining and enjoyable.  But its unfortunate that the film was rated R.  If it was because of one or two spoken words of profanity that the film which is based on a novel targeted for young people could have been easily accessible for children.In fact, because of its rating, people may think that this is a violent war film but it's not, especially when compared to other films that are far violent and are given a PG/PG-13 rating.  The film does have a sex scene (nothing is shown), does have a scene of a wounded leg (not graphical at all) and yes, guns shooting at other people but nothing graphic.  This is one of those instances where a film should not have been given an "R" rating.As for the Blu-ray release, once again Sony Pictures Classics delivers in PQ and for a film of this type that is a war film but more dialogue and ambiance-driven, the lossless audio works very well for "Winter in Wartime".  Special features were more on the short side of this Blu-ray release as only one "making of" special feature was included.Recently, Sony Pictures Classics have been including Blu-ray and DVD combo packs of their films which is quite surprising but you know, as long as it's not sold to expensively to consumers, I do like the practice of giving cinema fans the best of both worlds as many movie fans are beginning to migrate from DVD to Blu-ray and by including both, it helps bring more people in watching their films in HD and this is one film that definitely looks wonderful on Blu-ray!Overall, "Winter in Wartime" is a film that is powerful and even memorable for its scene and performances.  Fortunately, it's not another "Soldier of Orange" (which is a great film) but a film that chooses to find its own path through a country in war through the eyes of a boy.Another solid release from Sony Pictures Classics.  Recommended!

$REVIEW.: Funny scene where they are supposingly looking on a laptop for information, yet it's not even on.I think the reason why many people don't find this one as scary is because they know it isnt real. There was so much hype and speculation about the first, it really bummed people out when they found out the truth. Still not as many "events" going on as in the first. The first was much better. Still a unique new way to bring "horror" to the screen.Side note. I want that house.

$review_text.: Princesses have come to Disney's rescue more than once. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs took Walt Disney and his studio from short subjects into the much more prestigious world of feature films. Cinderella brought the studio back from the WWII setbacks. And The Little Mermaid re-ignited Disney animation, officially launching a second golden age.It also redefined the musical form of animated features for the first time since Snow White. That is due largely to the vision of lyricist Howard Ashman, who can be seen on the bonus features conducting one of his insightful lectures. With the spectacular music of composer Alan Menken (who made his debut as an underscore composer with this film), the results reverberated throughout the entertainment industry.Those of us who still pine for cel animation (or 2-D, which seems dismissive) have so much to savor in this film, in particular Glen Keane's animation of Ariel herself. Even though elements of earlier Disney heroines were referenced (including Alice), no previous Disney animated lady ever had the range of expression as Ariel, thanks in no small part to the live modeling done by Sherri Stoner, who you can see in the best of the numerous bonus features, "Under the Scene: The Art of Live Action Reference." (Fans of Animaniacs also know her writing and acting in that great show.)As to acting in The Little Mermaid, the cast is superb, from the leads like Pat Carroll as Ursula to little gems like the seahorse voiced by Will Ryan. What might be overlooked is the fact that Jodi Benson plays two roles: Ariel and her "evil twin," Vanessa), both so distinctly that it's easy to think of them as two different voice actors). A little bit of trivia, too, about Sam Wright, who voices Sebastian: he was one of the featured players in the 1974 Broadway show, Over Here!, the first such show with music and lyrics by Richard and Robert Sherman (check out the cast CD, it's great).One quirky note: Is it just me, or does Prince Eric look a lot like David Seville from the '80s Saturday morning cartoon version of Alvin and the Chipmunks?If you want to have the lion's share of bonus features on DVD, keep your Platinum Edition or find a used copy.

$review_text.: Four cartoons in all. Others: &#34;Pluto's Christmas Tree&#34; and &#34;Santa's Workshop&#34;.  The Santa short is actually half of a 2-parter and should have included &#34;The Night Before Christmas&#34;, showing Santa delivering the toys. The Small One is an Oscar-winning cartoon by Don Bluth about a little donkey that has to be sold due to his age. He is sold to Joseph for Mary to ride. The transfer shows some wear and dirt --not cleaned up, but otherwise a nice copy. &#34;Pluto&#34; is the cartoon where Chip and Dale come home with the Christmas Tree that  Mickey chops down.Mickey's Carol seems to &#34;run fast&#34; as it's timing is only 28 minutes. However, no scenes seem to be cut, unlike the recent airing on network and cable. Note: Film can be sped up to 26 FPS and beyond. (Watch the sit-coms on TVLand and notice how &#34;high&#34; everyone's voices are!)  A very good value for $10! Four cartoons for the price of one. Running time: about 80 minutes.

$review_text.: Our Idiot Brother is, at its heart, the story of what one guy will do to get his dog back.I'm gonna get this out of the way from the get go, I loved this movie
It's full of true to life situations that happen everyday lead with standout performances by some of Hollywood's best up-and-comers...and Paul Rudd

The way they approached the situations, the way you could see these characters flaws and cracks, and the way they presented a normal family life were all so well done that, at times, I found myself wondering what I would do in that situation.Make no mistake, Our Idiot Brother is not the laugh riot it has been made out to be


Yes, it has some very funny parts and I did chuckle throughout, but it wasn't laugh out loud funny
I'm okay with this though

I like movies that portray real life objectively.In my eyes, Ned isn't even an idiot per se

I think he just cares too much and trusts too easily


Idiot qualities? Sure
I found myself sympathizing with him more times than not


Therein lies the reason I probably enjoyed the movie so much...I have those same qualities


I found myself getting mad at his family for treating him so badly and being so quick to pawn him off on someone else or talk down to him for no reason

But that works

They don't understand why he is the way he is

Like I said earlier though, once they start to understand you see that guilt, those cracks, and you genuinely feel like they want to right the situation.For everything we were promised through trailers and TV spots, Our Idiot Brother delivers something better, something with more substance and believability
The laughs are there though, and the acting is perfect from beginning to end
Highly reccommended.

$REVIEW.: Curiously this DVD does not offer widescreen (an automatic star loss). The &quot;Making Of&quot; featurette is a charming &quot;day-in-the-life&quot; type of documentary filmed and edited by Kubrick's wife. It opens with her  following him into his bathroom and then downstairs for filming. Jack is  his nuerotic and entertaining self the whole way. Highlights include the  little boy saying confidently that he was probably earning &quot;$500.00 or  $600.00 dollars&quot;, and Kubrick yelling at doe-eyed Shelly Duvall trying  desperately to defend the fact that missed her cue. As for the film itself,  we've all seen it. Kubrick's signature is lingering shots with haunting  music. Mood is his canvas, and it is very attractive. No other S. King film  is anywhere near &quot;The Shining&quot; in class and style. Jack  Nicholson's most intense roll to date. I suppose Duvall was very effective  in that I spend most of the movie wanting to slap the sh*t out of her  myself. Another trailer would have been nice because I don't remember this  one. It is merely the elevator door blood thing and the title. Anyway, a  nice addition to any DVD collection.
$SUMMARY.: a classic accomplishment for Kubrick

$REVIEW.: My first reaction to this film was to want to puke. I have seen pretty bad horror stuff but this one was filmed in such a deliberately believable/documentary style with a chillingly believable premise. There is something about this film that is just wrong.At the same time, if you read this review carefully you'll hopefully see that this film is more complicated and metaphorical than one would give it credit for. For example, notice that:SADI(e/st) is appropriately named.Some have remarked the soundtrack seems out of place, but the soundtrack matches perfectly with the scenery and with Mari herself; it all represents beauty and innocence, or being carefree. The soundtrack NEVER plays while the girls are in Manhattan; the city represents dirtiness. Later, natural and lyrical beauty is chillingly juxaposed with the most evil violence possible.When the girls are together drinking wine Mari is talking about the onset of winter and her breasts filling out. This is a scene of dark foreboding, though we won't realize it in the first viewing. Winter is the season of death, and Man's fall from grace in the discovery of sexuality (depicted here as Mari's womanhood) is a well known theme from the Biblical the Book of Genesis.The lines "and the road leads to nowhere" plays by itself at one point while the girls are driving into the city. The road to nowhere is the road to the city, the city is "nowhere" (when the gang's car breaks down one of them sighs, "Great. We're a million miles from NOWHERE, too"). Alternately, "nowhere" symbolizes death (the line is playing again when the parents are running down the road to the lake).When Krug sticks out the revolver for the first time to shoot Mari, there is one arm shot which is an exact imitation of the infamous 1968 photo of a South Vietnamese officer executing a Viet Cong. The gun used is the exact same type of gun. If you think I'm overanalyzing watch the Vietnam video or look at the photo in contrast to the scene; you'll understand.When he shoots Mari, she turns around to look exactly like Ophelia drowning from Hamlet, especially as depicted in Harold Copping's and John Everett Millais's famous paintings. She has long brown hair just like Ophelia's. If you don't believe me Google the paintings, especially Copping's. She's even facing in the same direction.Sadie is the only one to go entirely into the lake to wash herself out after the killings, afterwards she reaches her hand out and says "Help me out" because she can't get out of the water. Later she dies in just the same way. This symbolizes the inability to truly escape from the crime.When the criminals are eating at the parents' house, the red wine symbolizes blood while the meatballs and spaghetti symbolize blood and flesh. It shows them cutting and drinking heavily.When the mother asks Phyllis what her parents do, she says they are in "the Iron and Steel business," the mother replies sarcastically "Iron and Steel together, how unusual" and she explains it stupidly as "My mother irons and my father STEALS."Later when the father asks the criminals later what sort of business they are in, one says "plumbing" and the other says "insurance" and Sadie explains it that they sell insurance to the plumbing companies, adding stupidly, "You know, in case they STEAL some toilets or something."This parallel is significant because both Phyllis and the criminals later represent "Trojan horses", harmful people from the inner city intruding on the pure rural home in the guise of respectability.At the beginning of the movie Mari is debating the band "Bloodlust" with her parents, her father asks "Don't you feel sorry for the chickens?" and Mari replies sarcastically, "I couldn't tell you the nights I cried myself to sleep over that CHICKEN (emphasis Mari's)"Later, in the scene immediately after Mari's death, the police officers cannot get a ride on the black woman's truck because she's got "11 crates of chickens."The semi-toothed black woman's plot role is as a target of impatience/resentment here. It is just after the worst killing and the viewer is emotionally most upset, the last thing we want to see is someone laughing at the incompetence of the police. We desperately want people to respect and help the police so they can do their job and bring these bastards to justice. There's a similiar scene just before the killings where some hippies scream "We hate cops!" and give them the finger instead of giving them a lift. But it's the viewer who hates the hippies and their attitude. After all there is a girl being raped!Most controversially perhaps I will claim that there is a definite hard-right political edge running through this film. Besides the overarching vigilante theme (which is consistent with the backlash against crime more openly portrayed in films such as Dirty Harry (1971) or Death Wish (1973)), targets of impatience/resentment or symbols of foolishness include hippies, the city, a black woman, a drug addict, and most of all the rebellious daughters themselves. The police are also objects of derirsion but it's because they don't take crime seriously enough, they aren't hard enough on crime. Phyllis is punished for her rebelliousness wanting to buy marijuana and biting Krug when he opens the trunk (otherwise the cops would have found them), and Mari is punished for being with Phyllis and defending her against her parents' wishes. But Mari's death is more dignified in that she is spared the disemboweling. By saying the Lord's prayer she has cleansed herself of the rebelliousness displayed in the opening act.But the only unblemished dignity for most of the film is found in the conservative parents, representing traditional family values. In the end they are driven to craziness by the craziness around them... Much as American society is driven to the craziness of making films such as LOHTL as a response to the spiraling crime of the 1970's (The theme of vigilantism and the descent into insanity shows up in other works of this period, such as the much more appreciated Taxi Driver (1976)). Society was breaking down in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Everything previously taken for granted was being ripped into a million pieces. It's impossible for this movie not to reflect that, and perhaps not to be a part of the violent backlash. Later this quintessential model would be made more acceptable and repackaged, sparking off the 1980's horror genre, a kind of mass social therapy provided by Hollywood.

$REVIEW.: The other night, I went to see Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" again. I must admit I didn't like it any better this time. I thought that, on second viewing, the movie would just fly by, as so often happens when you resee a film. On the contrary, I found it long and, at one point, I actually started nodding off. (Not during the flogging scene, I can assure you of that. I felt more distant and remote then, less viscerally affected by the violence.)  While I didn't like "The Passion" any better, I did come away with a greater understanding of the imagery Gibson uses -- more specifically, its roots in scripture. For instance, I realized that he was portraying Judas as mad -- possessed, in fact -- based on the gospel verse that says, "The devil entered into him." At the beginning, when Jesus steps on the serpent and kills it, that echoes a verse in Genesis: "He shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for his heel." This verse has traditionally been seen as God's promise of a Redeemer for a fallen humanity.  The problem is, how many moviegoers today will be aware of these biblical references -- even Christians? Gibson's film is obviously a testament to his own faith. But he has made the assumption that everybody else shares that belief, and has thus made a film that, in effect, preaches to the converted. What about those who do not believe, or who simply do not know about Jesus? Gibson's "Passion" will not reach them because it does not speak, does not even try to speak, their language.  The other problem is that Gibson's version of the death of Christ is a hodge-podge of biblical influences, popular piety and his own idiosyncratic touches. Jesus's trek along the Via Dolorosa reflects, not the gospels, but the Stations of the Cross you find in every Catholic church. Many of the 15 stations portray events not mentioned in the gospels. Again, how many people in the audience will be able to separate fact from fiction?  One final note: "The Passion" has been accused of fostering anti-Semitism, yet it tells the story of One who was Himself a Jew. More than that, His death took place against the backdrop of one of the holiest days of the Jewish calendar, Passover. When Mary says, "Why is this night different from all other nights?" she echoes the question asked by the youngest male member of every observant Jewish family on Passover night. And Jesus's Last Supper was a Passover meal. This is hinted at, but not fully brought out in the film.  In short, Gibson takes too much for granted, assumes that his audience shares his knowledge of the Christian faith -- and misses a golden opportunity to explain that faith to others.

$review_text.: Charlie, a half-Irish, half-Italian restaurant manager (played by a very young Mickey Rourke) employs his young cousin Paulie (an equally young Eric Roberts) as a waiter.  Charlie wants to do better, and dreams of opening his own restaurant, but Paulie is full of tricks and schemes, always dreaming of ways to become bigger and better.Paulie spins a dinner check, and gets both Charlie and himself fired from their jobs.  Then Charlie finds out his girlfriend Diane (a young and stunning Daryl Hannah) is pregnant.  Charlie has enough problems with his ex-wife Cooky and supporting his son Vinnie, so Charlie needs to score big to change his situation.  Paulie's got the plan all laid out.The problem is, Paulie is a screw-up.  From investing in a racehorse to planning a break-and-enter, Paulie always seems to overlook the dangers of his schemes.  One of my favorite scenes, one that still after all these years brings a smile to my face and a chuckle to my lips, is Paulie's retribution to the surly street cop who administers parking tickets by immediately towing cars.'Pope' is a fantastic, low-key film with exceptional entertainment value.  A great movie from the early 80's that is still poignant.  Adding to the flavor, you should have a great time chuckling when you see all the shiny suits, tight pants, and permed hair.  The supporting cast is great, with Burt Young playing 'Bedbug' Eddie Grant, Kenneth McMillan playing Barney the safecracker, and Tony Musante as uncle Pete.  Put a nice soundtrack with Sinatra's 'Summer Wind' behind it, and you have a tasty, laid back treat to watch when you're feeling mellow.  Enjoy!

$review_text.: I was far from dissapointed in this movie, or in the series as a whole, though they did take some creative liberties. I usually don't mind about creative liberties, as long as they keep the original theme, the main characters, and preserve the flavor that the books have. Mr. Landon Jr. has, I believe, suceeded in this for the most part. The plot in this the fourth installment to the series is fuller and richer than in any of the preceeding films, with several sub-plots imaginativly woven into the main. Clark is finally reunited with his daughter, Missie, after taking a stage-coach out west to her and Willie's struggling ranch, and he meets his grandson Maddy, grand-daughter Kathy, and adoptive grandson Jeff for the first time, as well as the faithful old ranch hands Scottie and Cookie, who have stayed by the Lahayes through the thick, and, now, in the thin. The happy moment is shattered, however, when the "grim reaper" comes for one of the Lahaye children. Friends with overwhelming burdens in their own lives reach out to the young couple with love and compassion, but nothing can keep Missie from the troubling reality that she is no longer capable of coping with the responsibilities of school-teaching, thus putting Willie in a position of reluctantly accepting the local Mayer's offer of a job as Tetsford Junction's first sherrif. While a blosseming friendship between teenage Jeff and Colette Doros -- the Mayor's daughter -- takes an honest turn for romance, Missie and Willie draw into seperate islands of dispair. Only Clark's determination to peirce through the darkness enshrouding Missie, only her own realization that she must do something to help Willie when he comes to a crisis between friendship and the letter of the law, only God's love, and the promise of abiding joy to those who trust in Him . . . is able to bring their hearts to a meeting place once again. Beatiful filming and music, touchingly potrayed relationships between people all of America has come to care about, and a story that promises to inspire. As far as the P.G. rating goes, I think it would have been wise to rate it so even without Mayor Doros' low muttered "h**l", or the kissing scene between Jeff and Colette. The theme is very mature, and without parental guidence young children might become upset and confused as Missie and Willie deal with their grief and try to help their neighbors in difficult circumstances. But with parental guidence, I think it would do no harm for the whole family to watch this together. Three cheers for the 4th to come!

$REVIEW.: This 'movie' is really only two stories and no fun. the first is a story of a circus bear wanting to live in the wild. He escapes and meets a girl bear who slaps him. This apparently means she loves him. He won't slap her so the mean bear gets her and they battle it out. Second story is the Mickey Jack and the Beanstock, which I loved as a kid, but it is narrated by a weird guy with puppets. I'm sure this was great in the 60's but this is not even close to PC and the stories actually suck. That's right, I said it. It sucked.

$REVIEW.: Really I should know better than to enjoy this film that was so obviously made with kids in mind. Yet there was something about this film that I couldn't help but respond to. Maybe it was the fact that I, like the kids in this film grew up in a northwest climate during the eightees. Or maybe it was the fact that I too dreamed of pirates and finding buried treasure as a kid.Anyway, I really did enjoy watching this film. It has suspenseful moments, exciting action sequences, and incredible sets. The kids were all quite likable, indeed I remember kids like the goonies while I was growing up. I think all of us have met people like Chunk at some point, a worrisome, glutinous, but good natured kid. Steven Spielberg wrote the story for this film, and his influence can certainly be felt throughout. Interestingly, the climax of the film foreshadows Spielberg's "Hook" which he would make a few years later. I guess making that film was always at the back of his mind.  Richard Donner was the director.  Donner also directed "Superman" and adds an amusing little reference to that film.The DVD is well worth purchasing as it allows the film to be shown in its original widescreen aspect ratio. The Goonies was shot as a widescreen film, as a result the pan & scan VHS cuts out a lot of the image making it difficult to see what is going on.

$review_text.: This is a cute little movie about a hockey team from a British boys school on a road trip to Amsterdam.  The pompous coach dreams of glory for the school, but the boys just dream of meeting Dutch girls.  This movie is of interest not for the story, but for who is in it.  It's the early work of Colin Firth and James Wilby.  Firth, of course, went on to hearthrob status as Mr. Darcy.  Wilby has made a wonderful career out of starring in high tone Merchant Ivory films like Maurice and brilliant Masterpiece Theater works such as A Tale of Two Cities and Island at War.  Though Firth's become the superstar, it's Wilby who shows more potential in this movie, as he attracts your eye in every scene he is in.Firth plays Neil Truelove, a sensitive, brooding teen.  He spends most of the movie making sad eyes at the camera, and he was really a painfully pretty young man.  Wilby plays Philip Dundine, Truelove's best mate.  Despite being tall and gorgeous, and more outgoing and confident, he's not having any better luck with the Dutch girls than Truelove is.  A third boy is Lyndon, a pig of a lad who romps around in bikini underwear, despite having a body we certainly don't want to see in bikini underwear.  He's the houseguest from Hell to his Dutch host family as he gets drunk and throws up on the carpet, throws food around, brings a bimbo home to have sex with her in the living room, and never flushes the toilet.Although these fellows are supposed to be schoolboys in their teens, they can't quite pull that off.  Firth is still boyishly slender and has a baby face, but still doesn't look like a teenager.  Wilby, despite a teen haircut, has a man's body.  The actor playing Lyndon looks like he's about thirty.One bit of trivia.  The captain of the team is played by Daniel Chatto, who later married the Duke of Kent's daughter, which makes him a fringe member of the British royal family.Though this isn't a great film, it is interesting enough to entertain a viewer, though it probably won't go on anybody's top ten list.  Just a pleasant little bit of fluff made more interesting by the presence of Firth and Wilby.

$REVIEW.: Even though Yoshiaki Kawajiri--one of my favorite anime directors--was directing one of the three segments of this video, I couldn't help but feel a bit unsatisfied when all was said and done.  This is not to say that  &quot;The Cockpit&quot; doesn't have its merits...it certainly does,  particularly the art direction in the first two episodes.  Kawajiri's  story, the first, is a down-to-the-rivet recreation of the air war over  Europe--the technical scope of this piece is nearly astonishing at times.  Having the protagonist of this piece be a Nazi Luftwaffe officer is a  daunting task, but for the most part Kawajiri and his crew manage to pull  it off, if a bit melodramatically.  Unfortunately in the interview  following this segment, Kawajiri continually sidesteps the moral aspects of  his story, choosing instead to focus on the technical aspects of it.The  second segment also falls a bit short, and it is particularly disappointing  in this case, since the hero of this story is the Japanese flier who must  pilot an Ohka suicide rocket-bomb into a U.S. warship.  I was really  looking forward to a Japanese insight into the mind of a kamikaze pilot,  but unfortunately director Imanishi leaves too much unsaid--there is little  shown of the devotion of those pilots, not enough insights into what drove  these men to do what they did.  Nonetheless, what IS on the screen is  remarkable stuff.  &quot;The Cockpit&quot; is not superb, but it is very  good at times, story-wise.  And as usual, the technical achievements of the  animation, particularly in the dog-fight sequences, are often stunning.

$review_text.: I took my boy to this and we both loved it.  Am I the only one who noticed the Heavy Metal-ish animation?  The part where they end up in the ice crystal field is the best animation (and super sound effects to boot)I've seen in a long time.  The story is cool, although it drops the ball towards the end, it is overall satisfying. I read in another review that because this movie tanked at the box-office, Fox animation was shut down.  That is too bad, really because this film is very entertaining.  The one low point of the film is the pathetic acting.  Ive heard local radio commercials that had better dialogue delivery than this film did.  It almost seemed that Damon and Berrymore fealt this cartoon was beneath them to do and it showed.  With films like Bug's Life, you just knew all those involved were having a heck of a time playing their respective characters.  I just with the two afforementioned had the same kind of time making Titan A.E.  Overall, you will enjoy this film.  My son cant wait for dad to pick it up on DVD so he can enjoy the surround effects we enjoyed in the theater, not to mention to also enjoy the adventure along the way.

$REVIEW.: Going into this film, I had high expectations
 The information on the box make the movie seem a lot more "intense" than it turns out to be


 The film is about a supermodel (Jessica Alba) who is cheating on her boyfriend

 She goes with her new love interest to his home which happens to be located hundred of miles away from her place of residence, and is also rather isolated from others

 She is drugged and held hostage for several days by the now cruel and abusive man she thought she loved
 This sounds interesting doesn't it?  However the film contains too many gaps of almost nothing being done on screen in between the actual scenes that contain anything that could be considered as action
 There are scenes that fill you with suspense, however these scenes rarely occur and are too far apart from each other
 This often results in unnecessary dialogue that has nothing to do with the story in anyway, instead it simply distract from the suspense that could have been occurring in its place


 The film does pick up, and the ending is rather good

 Overall it is a decent film, however don't expect too much out of it.

$review_text.: It's a cliche but also true. It's just like two best friends saying "we can sleep together and still be best friends and not ruin the friendship" It's naive. And this movie is more complicated than that, and it's about a wealthy businessman (Robert Redford) who makes an INDECENT PROPOSAL to a young poor couple (Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore) and it's an offer of one million dollars for one night with David's (Harrelson) wife (Moore) It's amazing what rich people do with their money, and even more so it's amazing what poor people will do for money. In this case, the couple believes they have it all figured out, no feelings, no mind no heart just her body, just sex, for the money they need for their future that could last a lifetime. And the saddest part is when David actually wakes up, and realized he made a terrible mistake and runs all over the hotel looking for her, and then off she goes in a helicopter with Mr. Wonderful. Right then and there you know what's going to happen later on. Bitter feelings, jealousy, guilt, and hating her for doing it when it's himself who he hates more for actually letting her do it. No man should ever sell his wife, for one night, for one minute it just isn't right even for all the money in the world if you love her, never let someone try to steal her for cash. It's sleezy no matter how you look at it. Demi Moore is absolutely gorgeous in this film. And there was excellent acting by her and woody, and this is a very romantic movie. A little sad here and there but a nice message about what money can do. They say money has power over people, it's evil, and greed will always get you the short end of the stick no matter what. And even doing the wrong thing for the right reason doesnt mean it will turn out ok.

$REVIEW.: This movie stars Katharine Hepburn as Bunny Watson and Spencer Tracy as Richard Sumner.  Bunny is the smart and witty manager of the reference department at a big TV network.  She and her coworkers do their best to answer a large variety factual of questions in a timely manner, and they usually do a pretty good job.  However, the company sends in Richard Sumner to improve the division's perfomance, and suddenly everyone's afraid they're going to be replaced by a very large computer(aka EMERAC).  Bunny's boyfriend, on the other hand, is afraid that he's going to get replaced by Sumner.As far as the romance goes, this movie is lukewarm.  There's not a lot of romantic chemistry between Bunny and Sumner, although I do think that their conversations were a lot of fun to watch.  However, I thought this movie was really funny and clever.

The performances are so finely nuanced that they no longer seem like "Acting" as the movie barely seems to be "Directed"; the transparency that is achieved by this work of artistic creation will grow as the years pass by  -  as we strive, in contrast, fifty years from now, to remember the name of that year's oscar-winning director whose amalgam of sound and fury signify, ultimately, nothing.  -  I must add, four years later, that this film is best seen in the theater.  It is marvelous on DVD as well; it's just that there is something gained by this work when the images we witness are truly 'larger than life'.

$REVIEW.: To start out, just so there is no confusion, this is a GREAT film


 It is one of my favorites.But I'm not writing this review to gush about the film itself

 Many people have already done that here and quite a few have done a better job than I can do


 I am writing this to (hopefully) clear up some confusion about which DVD version to buy.There were a few negative comments about the film itself, but those people are probably the kind of morons who think an interesting film has to have car chases and lots of explosions


 I guess we should feel sorry for them and their pathetic lives.Virtually all of the other negative comments were praising the film but grousing about the quality of the DVD transfer


 The contrast was low (muddy grays instead of blacks and whites) and excessive noise on the video and audio

 But, strangely enough, others were saying that their DVD was fine
 All of the reviews about this movie were lumped together, but none of these reviewers mentioned exactly which version they were writing about.A number of people (including myself) wanted to purchase this film, but we did not know which one to order
 It turns out that my local library had a copy on hand, so I checked it out this morning

 We didn't have time to watch the entire film, but we did jump to various chapters to see how it looked.Apparently, we found the good version


 The blacks were black, the whites were white, and there were many shades of gray in between

 There was a little noise at the beginning during the opening credits, but otherwise the transfer was surprising clean for a movie that's over 60-years old.And now (drum roll please) the copy to buy is:The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)* Studio: MGM (Video & DVD)* DVD Release Date: July 18, 2000* ASIN: 0792846133It's the one with the red cover and the MGM logo at the top.This is the version Amazon is currently selling and they have a great price

 Go for it!  I'm going to order a copy right away.

At first this seems similar to the hit tv show &quot;The Sopranos&quot; in its concept and idea with having hitman Macy see a psychiatrist, ably played by John Ritter.  However, Tony Soprano fits into his mobster family's world a lot better than Macy's character Alex does.  Alex exhibits all the classic signs of someone who has been steamrollered into the family business, really doesn't belong there and wants out of it.  His conflict is with his father (Donald Sutherland), mother (Barbara Bain) and himself.  No other mobsters are even used in the film.  Sutherland and Bain are superb as the facade smooth parents who expect and get total devotion to their aims from their son and expect the same generation after generation.  The other main characters, Alex's wife, his girlfriend and his son, serve as contrast to the tension created by this deadly trio.  Alex grabs hold of the three of them, who have no idea of the nature of his &quot;work,&quot; as if they can keep the demons of his parents at bay. Macy gives a very subtly layered and nuanced performance that delivers a very profound look at the dark side of a middle aged man caught between his parents and his own desires.  I haven't seen Neve Campbell in many roles but she shows lots of promise for the future.  Traci Ullman as the wife does not give us her usual comic turn, turning in a solid dramatic performance as the wife instead.  Give this film a chance.

$REVIEW.: &#34;The Man Who Lived at the Ritz&#34; was based upon the bestselling novel by A. E. Hotchner and tales to story of an American artist living in Paris during the German occupation.  At first, the protagonist attempts to remain neutral but increasingly finds himself dragged into a world of cloak and dagger mystery as he is recruited by the French Resistance.  As far as historical accuracy goes- don't bother looking, you won't find it.  As a drama, it is a bit too melodramatic at times, but generally succeeds in created a fun adventure/romance film that almost feels like something out of the 1940s.In one way that it distinctly feels unlike a 1940s feature is the surprising amount of female nudity on display.  I remember watching this on TV as a kid with my parents and the nudity certainly wasn't there for American broadcast TV.  This was no doubt originally shot for European distribution, and I believe the film was a European production.  Despite that element, the film is really built upon an intriguing plot and genuinely engaging characters.  Perhaps the highlight of this film is Joss Ackland, who plays Nazi bigwig Hermann Goering.  While the portrayal isn't 100% accurate, it is nevertheless a lot of fun to see this under-appreciated actor steal every scene.  Cherie Lunghi was also quite good as the principle love interest.If you enjoy WWII era spy stories with a little romance, you should check out &#34;That Man Who Lived at the Ritz.&#34;

$REVIEW.: I have to agree with most of Toshif's DVD review (March 27, 2001) of THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.  In terms of the script, acting, and the historical accuracy, it clearly is a better film than GLADIATOR.  The latter film clearly borrowed copiously from THE FALL, why was this not acknowledged?  Alec Guiness is wonderfully cast as emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.  His performance is far better than the rather weak performance of Richard Harris in the same role in GLADIATOR.  I would like to touch on another film that seems to owe something to THE FALL.  My young son, on seeing Marcus Aurelius making his first appearance exclaimed, "That's Obi-Wan Kenobi!"  It is true, even down to the costuming and beard, the resemblance of the two characters played by Alec Guiness is startling.  We then looked up the biography of Marcus Aurelius in the World Book Encyclopedia and were informed that the Stoic emperor believed that all mankind was bound together by a "universal force."  This cannot possibly be entirely coincidental!  Is Guiness' Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight, in the STAR WARS epics a reprise of his portrayal of Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher emperor of Rome?

$REVIEW.: One of the best westerns made. It was released on laser disc a long time ago. Now they're finally getting around to DVD. Two venerable stars go out with a blaze of glory in this tale about the end of an era. Both in terms of time and setting of the film and also the end of Hollywood turning out westerns as standard movie fare. And as to the latter, I am sincerely regretfull. You have adequate folks laying out the story line here, suffice it to say it's about two old friends who have a falling out over a gold shipment they're transporting and their commitment to get it to the rightful owner, complicated by the marriage gone wrong of a young lady that joins them along the way. Just know that's it's done with class and a bit of reverence for the genre. As it should be.

$review_text.: Axed by Fox after airing eight episodes, Point Pleasant was another of a handfull of shows to never get the time needed to grow.  However, for everything that Point Pleasant does right, it does a lot wrong.  The storyline centers around a girl named Christina (Elisabeth Harnois) who is taken in by a family and is soon revealed to be none other than the daughter of Satan, and will play a role in the coming apocalypse.  The storyline is nothing new, but there was a lot of room here to work with to make the show something special, but thanks to Fox it never took off.  Grant Show is undoubtadly the best part of the series as the evil Lucas Boyd, but the rest of the cast isn't anything to write home about.  Besides TV veteran Richard Burgi and Starship Troopers' Dina Meyer, the rest of the cast is stiff and wooden, but when it appears that they were cast on mostly their looks alone, this isn't much of a surprise.  The story has it's share of fumbles and predictability and it's too melodramatic for it's own good, but that is something that occurs with most first seasons before the show really takes off (remember the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer?).  Speaking of Buffy, it should be noted that Point Pleasant is co-created by Buffy alum Marti Noxon (who it is rumored tried to recruit James "Spike" Marsters for the show in a guest role), so who knows what direction the show could have taken had Fox given it more of a chance.  Just like countless other sci-fi/dramas to hit Fox over the past decade, Point Pleasant was axed too early by the geniuses at Fox, but for die hard fans of the show, this DVD set is a must have, although a few more extras would have been more than welcome.

$REVIEW.: The Daimajin collection brings you a trilogy of the not well-known Daimajin kaiju. Leagues away from what you can expect from a Godzilla or Gamera film, these are much more dramatic films. The best way to imagine the feel of these movies is to picture if a samurai film decided that instead of the hero hacking his way to justice in the climax, a giant stone god would come to life to avenge the underdog. And it's no surprise that these have such a samurai film feel -- if you are familiar with the Zatoichi series, the directors of each film (Kenji Misumi, Kazuo Mori, and Kimiyoshi Yasuda) all directed multiple Zatoichi films.The films take place in feudal Japan and all three involve a corrupt warlord subjugating hapless villagers. The first film centers around the children of a betrayed lord who grow up in exile and return for vengeance and justice. The second features a greedy warlord scheming to overtake lands that are not his. The final film follows four children on a trek across the god's mountain trying to save a group of village men forced into slavery for another evil warlord.The plots are fairly simple, and the climaxes foregone conclusion, but the drama is done well. The first film has the most of that samurai movie feel. The second was the weakest of the three for me, but still it was not a bad movie by any means. The final one was the most charming, and least predictable of the three and I enjoyed it the most.All three have truly amazing cinematography. Not only are the films set against majestic landscapes, but each director had an unerring sense for what effects of the giant monster would or would not look good, and anything unsatisfactory must have hit the cutting room floor. All the effects have aged very well due to this, and are the most convincing kaiju effects I have seen from any movie out of this era, and even from most of them made in the decades to follow. By keeping the effects from being too "big" each director has kept the films from falling into absurdity once the 50 foot tall monster emerges.More high marks go to the scores, and with Akira Ifukube of Godzilla fame at the helm that is no surprise at all. All of the music enforces the magical feel of the movies and enhances the drama and destruction throughout.Kaiju fans will be very pleased with these more dramatic takes on the genre, and even non-kaiju fans can enjoy the films since they rely so much more on the characters than the creature itself.As for the Blu-Ray itself, these are some jaw dropping transers. I have other Japanese kaiju films from more recent times, and better selling franchises, on Blu-Ray and they don't look half as good as the Daimajin films do. Someone put a lot of love into these. The Japanese audio has not been modernized to a 5.1 surround mix, but the authentic 2 channel mix works just fine and that monster's footsteps still boom out. The English audio track is just slightly inferior to the Japanese track in terms of actual sound, however, I can't imagine anyone will listen to it due to the poor dubs that these movies have been given. The first two films are not the WORST I have ever heard, but the advertised new English language track for Daimajin Strikes Again is excruciating and will have even hardcore "dubs over subs" folks giving it up to do the Japanese audio with subtitles.Each film is accompanied by a 30 minute segment of a 90 minute total documentary/interview with cinematographer Fujio Morita. It features some good spots on how the effects were done, but for the most part only those very interested in either Daimajin or filmmaking from this time will want to sit through all of it as it seems to be largely unedited from the raw interview and is rather dry as a result. Still, I am impressed that such an out of the way type release as this got such a full documentary attached to it.Overall, great accessible kaiju films done by top notch directors with everything spot on from effects to music AND you have an AWESOME transfer of the films. It's an incredible set. I had only vaguely heard of Daimajin but decided to pick it up since all three were in one set and I am so glad I did.

$REVIEW.: Even though it has been over 50 years since the first episode of "Twilight Zone" appeared on TV it is still one of the best series of all time. The entire Twilight Zone series has been released on a series of 45 DVDs containing 3 to 4 episodes on each DVD. They then split up the DVDs into box sets with 9 DVDs each, a total of 5 collection boxes. Collection 1 has DVDs 1 through 9. Many of the classic episodes are in this collection. Way too many to list all of them but among the best of the best include "Time Enough At Last" (one of 4 TZ episodes that Burgess Meredith appeared in), "The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street", "Nightmare At 20,000 Feet", "A Game Of Pool" (one of 4 TZ episodes that Jack Klugman appeared in tying him with Burgess Meredith for the most appearances on the show. Jonathan Winters co-starred in the episode), "I Sing The Body Electric", "The Passersby", "Death-Head Revisited", "To Serve Man" (spoiler alert! it's a cook book) and "It's A Good Life". The picture quality is very good on these discs which just makes is all the more enjoyable to watch. Anyone who is a fan of the show will want this and all the other collections in their video library. It is a true must have.

$review_text.: I often think that David Lynch starts by creating his films by producing the soundtrack, then adding &quot;some visuals&quot; and the story evolves from it in an organic way. This certainly appears to be the case with  &quot;Lost Highway.&quot; If you liked Twin Peaks: Fire walk with Me for  it's general level of weirdness then you'll love &quot;Lost  Highway&quot;The film is more coherant than Twin Peaks - less strange  stuff for the sake of it. The symbolism is much more subtle and grafted  onto the plot. It's a terrifying film, not because there is anything in  there that is gory but it's so quiet, dark and moody that you get an  uncomfortable feeling watching it (now *that's* directing).The story?  Well, it's difficult to explain and makes Dune seem like &quot;The  Waltons&quot; in comparison. As Lynch puts it, it's about a man who  experiences a 'psychotropic fugue' to get away from his current  existanceThe soundtrack is simply staggering and I don't just mean the  music. Lynch seems like the only director who actually USES sound to his  advantage to tell the story, scare or horrify the audience. The music is  terrific, I bought the album straight after seeing the video, David Bowie,  Angelo Badalamenti all in one.Along with the Twin Peaks movie this is  Lynch's finest work (yes, it's better than Blue Velvet). Make sure you see  it in Widescreen too!

$REVIEW.: From the very beginning of the documentary, one can see the creative license of the producers by focusing the cameras on the sun-baked, glistening ocean scene of Newport. This brings us back to a much more simple and appealing era. The color of this movie is vivid for its time and the music of jazz is very intoxication. I loved the way the cameras showcased the legendary artists of this era. Some were great for only that time but others, like Mahalia Jackson reveal why her appeal was  and still is breathtaking, never to be forgotton nor possible to immitate. Mahalia sang her heart out and with such humility,  looks at the waves of applause from jazz enthusiasts ,who were captivated by her dynamic performance and very humbly declares with a motherly wit "You make me feel like I'm a Star" Mahalia was more than a Star and she did not even know it.

$review_text.: 24 is a class on its own. Even though there are some differences (explained above) between Season 4 and the previous three, the fact remains that this is a truly outstanding show.If you enjoyed the first three seasons, number 4 will not disappoint you. If you did not, don't waste your time. And if you have not yet watched any season, and even though #4 is great, my advise would be to start from the beginning, with #1. But if you don't have patience and want to move on to this one, go for it. Not having watched the previous ones will have minor impact on your enjoyment.24 is one of the most addictive action series ever. Its "live drama", simultaneous shots of actions happening in different places at the same time, its writers' willingness to create unexpected turns of events (those daring situations which usually you don't expect to happen), are some of the reasons why its so outstanding. You will be glued to your seat while you watch this fantastic show. Yes, it is not perfect: some characters (like the emotionally-challenged Chloe O'Brian and Edgar Stiles) are truly (and I guess intentionally) awkward and are not as believable as the rest. Still, this is one of the best things that have happened to television in the past years.

$review_text.: I love these big epics from the 30s-60s, and Samuel Bronston was almost as good at churning them out as the master, Cecil B. (besides El Cid, he notably did such classics as Fall of the Roman Empire, 55 Days at Peking and King of Kings), and El Cid is one of his best.It has awesome production values (a great climactic battle scene and the best one-on-one joust ever filmed, bar none) and a very entertaining story. The acting is first rate, not only from the stars (I think Heston gives one of his best, most restrained (if that is the right word) performances and Sophia Loren never, ever looked more beautiful) but also from the supporting actors, Raf Vallone and Gary Raymond, in particular.All in all, a very enjoyable way to spend a few hours.One other thing.  An aspect of films often overlooked is very much in the fore here, the background musical score.  It is an aspect of films, especially epic specataculars, that is absolutely essential to the complete experience and this one is scored by one of the great masters of the genre, Miklos Rozsa (Ben-Hur, Double Indemnity, Julius Caesar and so on ad infinitum), at the absolute top of his form.  I hope someday that someone does a release of the FULL score on CD and gives it full justice, something long overdue.I'm not one of those folks who necessarily thinks that older is better, but I do think Hollywood either has forgotten how to (or more likely can't afford to) make these spectacular costume epics like they once did.  Epics today are made for the MTV generation, which may not be bad, but it's certainly different and not as much to my taste.Test it yourself. Watch this movie and say Spartacus or Ben-Hur and then watch Gladiator and say any one of the Superman movies. You might be surprised by which one has more satisfying acting, writing, plot-lines, set pieces and music (although I must admit Williams' score to Superman I is one of the half-dozen best ever composed).At any rate, thanks for this one Sam.  You'll find it money well spent.  Bring on Fall of the Roman Empire and 55 Days, please!!!

$REVIEW.: From the previews it almost looks like a period piece which might turn alot of people off, but this movie takes place in 1997 the week of Princess Diana's death.  It shows the effect her death had on the british empire and around the world.  I was one year out of high school and on my way to basic training in 1997, to immature and wrapped up in my own mind to understand the impact it had on people, yet watching this movie and seeing the live broadcasts it was touching you could feel it.It deserves it's 6 oscar nominations and one win for Hellen Mirren who does an amazing job.The queen also received 98% positve feedback on rottentomatoes of 166 reviews who can all write better than me.Stephen Frears directs he also directed the grifters and high fidelity both with john cusack, both movies also received 4 stars from the grand pooba of critics roger ebert and made his personal top 10 lists the years they were released.  Roger Ebert being out due to surgery from salivary cancer still reviewed the queen and also gave it 4 stars last year.  You can tell Stephen frears being born in the UK had some fun with this as when Prince Philip tells queen Elizabeth "move over cabbage" when he jumps into bed.  His movie has a great flow and does a beautiful job with the buck and the queen in the woods which symbolizes Dianna as the queen tries to help it but in the end it was still hunted down by the trackers almost as Dianna was by the paparazzi.  He has a great eye for detail i believe i saw a playstation 1 or a supernintendo on Tony blairs tv set.The movie does not take sides, and it shows us a side of a woman that nobody would get to see other than in a movie, and maybe help the way she is remembered.Thanks for reading.

$review_text.: IMHO, Metallica only has two things over Megadeth....Hetfield's amazing and instantly recognizable voice, and the fact that Metallica has always been more of a "band" than Megadeth.  James, Lars & Kirk have managed to stay together all these years while Dave has had a large number of partners in that same time frame.  Not that each lineup hasn't been great, cuz it has, but Metallica just projects a more cohesive identity as a band.  That said, Megadeth is much more interesting in the guitar department with always having two really good players, while Metallica relies pretty much totally on Hammett.  And then of course there's the key element in every band, the writing.  Metallica's writing is very, very good, but Mustaine's writing is just...better!  More creative, more diverse, even more emotional.  I mention all of this cuz it was impossible not to compare these two giants of this genre while watching this DVD set.  I like Anthrax well enough, but they're just not in the same league.  Joey Belladonna seemed to struggle a bit here and there.  And Slayer.....well, what can you say about Slayer.  I will give them props for still being the the top dog of the thrash idiom after two decades (the only band of the four that you could really still call thrash), but Mustaine  was quoted some years ago as saying "boycott noise metal", and I think that pretty much says it all for me.  Dave Lomabardo was very interesting to watch though.  Almost seems like he's too good to be in Slayer.Mustaine was in really great voice for this show, and Chris Broderick was the hottest soloist of all four bands to my ears.  Metallica's set was very good, but it was still Megadeth for me.  Great stuff....buy it!

The point and beauty of Wilde's play is that the blackmailer (Mrs Cheveley, who thinks she's too clever for everyone) gets blackmailed in return (in the scene where the bracelet plays a major part)


The tagline of Wilde's play (in the backcover of the Penguin Books edition I own) reads: &quot;In order to be a successful blackmailer, one's own reputation must be beyond reproach&quot;

In Wilde's play, the &quot;bracelet scene&quot; involves the cool Lord Goring and the scheming Mrs Cheveley


Why, why was the scene omitted from the movie?! Did the filmmaker find it difficult to produce the special-clasp bracelet? As a result, the movie fails to capture the most important point of the play and becomes only an average fare with a plot that fizzles out in the end
Instead of an embarrassed and defeated Mrs Cheveley who unexpectedly gets a taste of her own medicine (as in Wilde's play), the movie gives us a rather smug, victorious (and heaven forbid, almost &quot;virtuous&quot;) Mrs Cheveley in the end
This is totally different from what Wilde intended in his play and I find the omission of the &quot;bracelet scene&quot; to be a bad and unforgivable mistake on the filmmaker's part


Ugh! Hugely dissapointing!Watch the movie if you must, for its fine cast, beautiful costumes and witty lines (many taken verbatim from the play, of course)


Just don't expect to experience the 'true spirit' of Wilde's play

The omission of the &quot;bracelet scene&quot; certainly took away all my enjoyment of this adaptation.

$review_text.: I came to this movie on the advice of a friend, and I have to say I was not sorry. Although predictable, it is graced with fine performances by its veteran stars and a really nice turn by its youngest. It in fact kept me up two hours longer than I had planned; I only meant to watch a few minutes after coming home from work, and ended up absorbed enough to finish it.Jennifer Lopez, playing Jean, a single mother in an unnamed Iowa town, suffers abuse from her boyfriend for the last time (haven't we already been down this cinematic road with her?) and takes her 11-year-old daughter, escaping from the  situation in an anywhere-but-here moment at the beginning of the movie. They run out of options and money and go to the only bolthole Jean can think of to regroup - her bitter father-in-law Einar, a semi-retired ranch owner in Wyoming. Einar doesn't want her - he blames her for the accidental death in a car crash of his son, 11 years prior - and is not aware that he has a granddaughter, who looks remarkably like his son. He grudgingly accepts them and an uneasy truce forms between Jean and Einar, with the understanding that the mother and daughter will stay only long enough to get back on their feet.Observing all this in his usual sage way from across the road is Morgan Freeman, playing Mitch, Einar's ranch hand, who the previous year was mauled by a bear and is undergoing a painful recovery, still largely bedridden and patiently attended to by Einar. Mitch has a strange affinity for the bear that almost killed him and, when it is captured near town and put in a small zoo nearby, insists on Einar looking in on it occasionally to make sure it is OK. Einar's granddaughter,11-year-old Griff, quite naturally gets involved in this venture, and that,with her other childhood activities, goes its way toward endearing her to her gruff grandfather.Robert Redford as Einar plays his role as it should be played, as the embittered old man deprived of the one person who he really cared about and who focuses on Jean as the cause of his loss. His granddaughter proves to be the wild card, and is aided by Mitch, who watches everything happening from his observation post across the road and provides the catalyst for change. Morgan Freeman - really the reason I rented the movie, as I don't think he's capable of a bad performance - is great as the invalid old ranch hand, forgiving and benevolent, who sees the necessity in getting past emotional obstacles and moving on.Jennifer Lopez was a nice surprise - who knew she could act this well - playing a woman on the edge of desperation with just the right intensity. Her character does have the unerring knack of finding the right person (or persons) to come to her defense; upon landing a job in town her first day, she homes in on not only the town sheriff but the town's most formidable cafe worker, making a romantic partner of the sheriff and a valuable ally out of the cafe worker. Her daughter, played by Becca Gardner, more than holds her own amongst the adults; she is polite and respectful (a nice change to the kids you routinely see nowadays in film) but still manages to get her point across when necessary.Overall, while this movie is pretty Hallmarkian in tone (be warned; there are two or three scenes definitely NOT Hallmark material), it did not lag; the acting was good, especially from Morgan Freeman and Robert Redford; and the scenery is breathtaking. Lately Hollywood has been making good use of the West; they can continue, as far as I'm concerned. After viewing this film, I feel like I've been on vacation.

$review_text.: Before you even think about buying this DVD or even renting it, you'd better be comfortable with (incest, torture, rape, bondage, child abuse, and manipulation) all rolled up into one sick package. I truly mean that. This was one act that was hard to swallow and this is coming from a horror fan.I guess what made this film, based on Ketchum's novel, chilling is the fact that it was inspired by true events. You just never know who that person is that you pass by in the market or on the street. You just never know who your neighbor is. That's one of the lessons you'll learn from this movie.Please don't allow your kids to watch this with you. And men, ask your girlfriends or wives if they're going to be comfortable watching something like this instead of surprising them. You may end up in the dog house for sure.

$review_text.: The strength of Steven King is being keeping his creepiness on the edge of what can be real or normal

This story, a remake of the Japanese film by Hideo Nakata and based on "Honogurai Soko Kara" by Koji Suzuki is one of those that are just on the edge of real.Probably mentally challenged Dahlia Williams (Jennifer Connelly) is in the middle of a nasty divorce and due to economics is moving with her daughter `Ceci' (Ariel Gade) to a creepy slum tenement


Her daughter is also going a little funny, seeing dead people and so are we

Can her mother turn this all around and pull us out of this slump with a happy ending? Only time will tell


Now sit back and do not get caught talking to the invisible or very visible Natasha Rimsky (Perla Haney-Jardine.)Dark City [Blu-ray] - Jennifer Connelly

$review_text.: Many people are, at first, turned off by the fact that the original crew is not a part of the series.  However, this movie (and the other OVAs) actually take place just BEFORE the Slayers, Slayers Next, and Slayers Try series.  Sure, there is no Ghourry stumbling about, but Naga and Lina make a good set of "rivals" as they steal/win tickets for an exotic resort that appears rarely.  There is magic, mayhem, mockery, and, of course, the infamous Fireball (best one ever in the entire series can be found in Motion Picture).  This movie can stand on its own merits.  As Naga and Lina attempt to enjoy their stay at the resort, Lina is plagued by dreams of an old man who carries a familiar-esque staff, who needs her help resolving the past, where he failed to save his true love (those who have watched the other series will go "Oh" regarding the Gabriev family).  There are also the usual stock villains and constant teasings about Lina's small chest.  The voices are different, but understandable, as Lina is younger in this movie.  Overall, a lot of fun, and the best of the OVAs.

$REVIEW.: Written by Aaron Sorkin (&quot;The American President&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;) based on his play, &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, the story is centered around the nature of an assault and subsequent death of a Marine by two other Marines at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.Was it premediated? Did the base commander (Jack Nicholson) or his lieutenant (Kiefer Sutherland) order it or know about it? Prosecutors Demi Moore, Tom Cruise, and Kevin Pollak are sent to Cuba to find out. The suspenseful courtroom confrontation results in an oft-quoting line from Jack Nicholson.Well acted by all, including JT Walsh, Kevin Bacon, Cuba Gooding, Noah Wyle, a nearly unrecognizable Christopher Guest (Nigel Tufnel from Spinal Tap), and director Reiner's former assistant Wolfgang Bodison.I did not care for Tom Cruise's character, Lieutenenat Kaffee, because of his continual smart-ass attitude. As a lieutenant with a single piece of fruit-salad on his chest, his behavior toward superior officers, including a Navy Lieutenant Commander and a Marine Colonel, is inexcusable and would have him in trouble long before. Some of the rare humor in the movie is based on Kaffee never having a pen when he needs one, and not knowing how to interpret military time. His complete disregard for things military, including saying &quot;yeah&quot; instead of &quot;yes&quot; to the judge as his first word at the pre-trial meeting is more evidence of his lack of maturity and disrespect. I understand the point of the salute at the end of the trial, yet I feel it was undeserved and weakened the ending. Those are my only gripes.&quot;You can't handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has walls...and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lieutenant Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago, and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know - that Santigo's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives! You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties...you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall! We use words like &quot;honor&quot;, &quot;code&quot;, &quot;loyalty&quot;. We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punch line. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide...and then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said &quot;thank you&quot; and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn...what you think you are entitled to!&quot;This is only one of a long list of good movies from Rob Reiner (Stand By Me, Spinal Tap, Misery, The Princess Bride, The American President, When Harry Met Sally).The reasonably-priced DVD includes the widescreen movie, director Rob Reiner's somewhat sparse commentary, a behind-the-scenes, a bit about the development of the script, and the usual trailers, cast/crew/production info, subtitles, etc. And Demi keeps her clothes on, thanks.

$REVIEW.: Put Kate Beckinsale in black Leather with those pale blue contact lenses and I'd follow her anywhere; yes, even to watch this movie

Her husband / writter should have known better


This came across as a final effort to milk the franchise for every last drop of blood (money) they could

Kate should have stood her ground and insisted that Scott Speedman reprise Michael Corvins' character

Trying to hold continuity by "Micheal's on the roof" just doesn't make it


They had a golden opportunity with the story line offered in Underworld Evolution


It would have made a great Beckinsale / Speedman trilogy


Too bad

Even Selene can't pull this one off.

$review_text.: Since 1999, "Naruto" created by Masashi Kishimoto ("Karakuri") has been one of the most popular anime and manga series in Japan and has easily become a favorite best selling anime/manga series among fans all over the world.For the anime series, since 2002, "Naruto" lasted until 2007 with a total of 220 episodes. The series would follow the adventures of a boy named Naruto Uzamaki, who may not be the brightest ninja from the Konoha Village but he makes it up with heart and also tremendous power as the killer beast known as the nine-tailed fox has been sealed within him.Earlier in the series, the anime series focused on Naruto and his team members Sasuke Uchida and Sakura Haruno as they would go on adventures and learn to become a team and also honing their ninja abilities. The series would then begin to introduce other young ninjas from the village who Naruto would be paired up with and the young ninjas would take on rival clans to helping people in need. But somehow as the series continued, Sasuke Uchida would then go off on his own personal mission to stop his brother Itaki Uchida, who murdered the whole Uchida clan and his family, only leaving Sasuke alive.Within those six years, we have seen Naruto and his friends grow as friends and also in their abilities. For Naruto, all he has wanted is to become the next Hokage (the leader of the village) when he grows older and to help his friends accomplish missions. He knows that to be a good leader, he will need to get stronger so he can protect the village once he grows older. Of course, there is so much involved in the "Naruto" anime series and what makes its special is its humor, its action but also how well the series integrates so many characters but yet features a good number of character driven episodes that makes the viewer appreciate many of the characters in the series."Naruto", the first series ended with the young ninja leaving to train with Jiraiya for two-and-a-half years.Here we are now with "Naruto Shippuden" (Naruto: Hurricane Chronicles), a sequel to the "Naruto" series and with the release of the second volume featuring episodes 14-26.In the first volume, Team Kakashi which consists of Kakashi, Naruto and Sakura are dispatched to the sand village after news that the Akatsuki (a criminal organization which includes powerful ninjas who defected from their villages and a group which include Sasuke's brother Itachi) members Deidara and Sasori have attacked the village and are after Gaara.  While the three hurry to get to the sand village, Lady Tsunade sends out Team Guy to provide as support (consisting of Might Guy, Rock Lee, Neji Hyuga and Tenten).With Gaara taken hostage by the Akatsuki, Gaara's brother Kankuro tries to save him but is stopped by Sasori of the Red Sand who literally beats Kankuro and injects him with poison, so he can suffer and die within three days.  Fortunately, Team Kakashi arrives and Sakura is there to use her medic skills to stop the poison but now they must go and save Gaara with the help of  one of the elders of the Sand Village, Grandma Chiyo. Who happens to also be the grandmother of Sasori.Here is a brief spoilerless summary of the episodes 14-26 for "Naruto Shippuden Box Set 2: Season One" included on three DVD's:DISC 4:* EPISODE 14 - Naruto's Growth - The Akatsuki clan sends out Kisame to stop Team Guy while Itachi is sent to stop Team Kakashi.* EPISODE 15 - The Secret Weapon is Called... - The battle continues as the Konoha ninjas take on Kisame and Itachi.* EPISODE 16 - The Secret of Jinchuriki - Grandmother Chiyo reveals of what happens to Naruto and Gaara if their beasts are removed from them.* EPISODE 17 - The Death of Gaara! - Akatsuki seal Gaara's beast which could be fatal for Gaara.DISC 5:* EPISODE 18 - Charge Tactic! Button Hook Entry!! - Team Guy is dispatched to destroy the barrier around the Akatsuki hideout.* EPISODE 19 - Traps Activate! Team Guy's Enemies - What was believed to be barrier seals ends up being a trap for Team Guy.* EPISODE 20 - Hiruko vs. Two Kunoichi! - Grandmother Chiyo briefs Sakura on Sasori and prepares her for battle.* EPISODE 21 - Sasori's Real Face - Chiyo and Sakura vs. Sasori (who reveals his true form).DISC 6:* EPISODE 22 - Chiyo's Secret Skills - Chiyo has to resort to using new puppets against Sasori in battle.* EPISODE 23 - Father and Mother - Sasori unleashes his Iron Sand technique on Chiyo and Sakura.* EPISODE 24 - The Third Kazekage - Sasori uses the third Kazekage puppet against Sakura and Chiyo.* EPISODE 25 - Three Minutes Between Life and Death - The battle continues between Chiyo, Sakura versus Sasori and with Sakura using an antidote to stop the poison, she has only three minutes to defeat Sasori before the antidote wears off.* EPISODE 26 - Puppet fight: 10 vs. 100! - Chiyo uses her "Ten Puppets of Chikamatsu" versus Sasori's "One Hundred Puppet Manipulation Jutsu".VIDEO:One thing I noticed when it came to "Naruto" is that the series has had its share of well-animated and well-painted artistic backgrounds but then for some of the filler episodes, has had a decrease in quality. Fortunately, "Naruto Shippuden" looks awesome. I really like how the characters look much older and the emotions on the character's faces to the action that takes place in the Sand Village is pretty cool.For the most part, these episodes for this box set is focused on battles, so a lot of the background scenes take place in a cave, above cliff-like areas or a hill.  So, there is more focus on the characters and the fighting sequences rather than overall setting.  But for the most part, the action was captured quite well and fans should be happy.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As for the audio, audio is pretty much Dolby Digital Stereo 2.0 Bilingual (Japanese and English). Similar to a series like "Dragon Ball Z", with "Naruto", I have always enjoyed the voice acting of the English dub series. It's well done and the voices fit the characters very well.  Especially Maile Flanagan's Naruto Uzumaki.  Personally, I didn't think there would be a voice actor that could capture Junko Takeuchi's Naruto vocals and sure enough, Flanagan does a great job.  But I have watched the series in Japanese and English and for the most part, voice acting for both soundtracks are well-done.Since the series is front channel driven, for those with a modern home theater receiver probably will enjoy a more immersive soundscape by selecting stereo on all channels.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:"Naruto Shippuden Box Set 2 - Season One: Original & Uncut" comes with the following special features:* Voice Actor Featurette: Sand vs. Leaf - Interactive Quiz Show - A video-based quiz show with the voice talents of "Naruto Shippuden" all competing (viewer needs to choose the correct answer and will be awarded points for getting 100 points).  Competing are Michael Lindsay (Kankuro), Liam O'Brien (Gaara), Tara Platt (Temari), Maile Flanagan (Naruto), Kate Higgins (Sakura), Dave Wittenberg (Kakashi) and a mystery host!* Relationship Chart: Team Guy - A text based feature showing the relationship of Team Guy: Might Guy, Rock Lee, Neji and Tenten.* Production Art - Using your remote, you can view 16 production art images.* Viz Media Trailers - Trailers for upcoming or current Viz Media releases.EXTRAS:"Naruto Shippuden Box Set 2 - Season One: Original & Uncut" comes with a slip case. It's important to note that the limited edition box set contains a mini ninja Naruto and an exclusive art card.JUDGMENT CALL:First, let me start out with how awesome "Naruto Shippuden" has been so far.  No slowdown or any weak filler episodes, so far every episode since the first have been all action-packed and intense.  "Naruto Shippuden Box Set 2 - Season One: Original & Uncut" continues that as the Konoha Leaf Village ninjas take on members of the Akatsuki.But with this volume, Sakura fans will be happy with this latest volume as we see how much Sakura has grown up and how her training as a ninja has literally brought her power to new heights.  Not only is she a medical ninja, she is now among the most powerful members with her ability to evade but also her ability of massive strength.  Never before have we seen Sakura put into a situation like this.  She was always the ninja that stood behind Naruto or Sasuke but no more.To watch Sakura and Grandmother Chiyo take on Sasori, this battle was action-packed, well-planned and it doesn't end quickly, there is a good build up of episodes and the cliffhanger that you are left with at the end of volume six makes you wanting even more!And also, it's not just Sakura that gets the spotlight in this volume, but we also get to see Team Guy in battle.  Especially Might Guy as he takes on Kisame Hoshigaki and seeing Rock Lee, Neji and Tenten get into it as well.  So, for the most part, it was great to see the characters all fighting in this episode and it makes you wonder when we will see Team 8 in battle.Overall, there are quite a bit of surprises, twists and turns but for the most part, another exciting, action-packed volume of "Naruto Shippuden"!  Definitely recommended!
$SUMMARY.: Sakura and Team Guy fans will definitely enjoy this latest volume!  Definitely recommended!

$REVIEW.: I saw &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; two times at the theaters, and the film kept getting better and better! &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; has more action, more comedy than the first film! And both Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan just couldn't be better...or funnier! It doesn't mean that the first &quot;Rush Hour&quot; was a bad movie, because I loved the first one as well


Remember in the first film when Jackie Chan was the fish out of water in Chris Tucker's world of L.A? Well, now, it's Chris Tucker's turn to be the fish out of water in Jackie Chan's world of Hong Kong

&quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; chronicles L.A.'s Detective James Carter (Tucker) and Hong Kong's Detective Lee (Chan) investigating a counterfeiting scheme that involves a dangerous Chinese triad leader (John Lone)
As far as the acting sequences go, Jackie Chan did an outstanding job as always


And hey, even Chris Tucker decided to get in on the action as well, and that was amazing! Zhang Ziyi (&quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;) did a superb job as well in her villainous role as the triad leader's henchwoman


In conclusion, if you want to see a typical buddy-buddy cop movie, then I suggest that you see &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; as soon as possible! A great DVD addition to add on to the first one.

$REVIEW.: Less than one year following the concluding season of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" in 1994, executive producer/writer Rick Berman, along with Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, created a fourth television series based upon the "Star Trek" universe originally created by Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's. This fourth television series, entitled "Voyager" (which is the name of the Federation of Planets starship used in the series), first aired in January 1995, and ran for seven seasons until it concluded in May, 2001. Because "Voyager" aired initially in the month of January (instead of the traditional September), only 16 episodes were filmed for the first season. The succeeding six other seasons had 26 episodes each, for a grand total of 172 episodes for the entire series.Unlike the previous three "Star Trek" television series, which (for the most part) took place within the bounds of the Federation of Planets (or in nearby sovereign areas of space, such as the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Empire) in the Alpha Quadrant, the starship Voyager is hurled tens of thousands of light-years from home into the previously unknown and unexplored Delta Quadrant, which is located at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy. Even while traveling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take Voyager several decades to return to Earth. Hence, the series focuses on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew, who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of doing. Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.The primary cast members of the second season of "Voyager" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Delta Quadrant native (Ocampan) Kes (Jennifer Lien), Lt. Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., "The Doctor", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr.  Tuvok (Tim Russ) and Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang).  Voyager's primary enemy in the second season is still the Delta Quadrant native species known as the Kazon.  With less sophisticated technology than the Federation, several of the Kazon desperately want to capture Voyager to use against their own warring people.  Seska (Martha Hackett), who left Voyager to join the Kazon during the first season, convinces a Voyager Maqui crewmember, Michael Jonas (Raphael Sbarge), to spy for the Kazon. Jonas' spying, the Kazon's desperation for technology and Seska's obsession for revenge culminate in the second season's cliffhanger final episode (a two-part episode that carries over into the third season).Through the second season, the holographic doctor's personality continues to develop as he works with Kes, the crew encounters the phage-infected Vidians again, Neelix's duties expand beyond cooking and B'Elanna continues her inner human-Klingon battle.  There are also several guest appearances from "Star Trek: The Next Generation" characters, including Reginald Barclay (Dwight Schultz) in episode "Projections", as well as William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Q (John de Lancie) in episode "Death Wish", which is one of the season's best episodes.  The best second-season episodes, in order of airdate, include "Non Sequitur", "Tattoo", "Resistance", "Dreadnought", "Death Wish", "Lifesigns", "Deadlock", "The Thaw" and "Tuvix".  The season's least memorable episodes include "Cold Fire" and "Investigations".Overall, I rate the second season of "Voyager" with 4 out of 5 stars. Sadly, the continued participation of the Kazon started to get old, as was the appearance of Voyager's second traitor (Raphael Sbarge's character of Jonas); but several of the second season's episodes clearly demonstrated that the show could have some very good creative writing.

$REVIEW.: This film is completely devoted to exploring life, dreams and hope of Wolfgang Amedeus' sister Nanerl Mozart.  She was older than her brother and very talented musician herself.  She played violin and piano and also had a voice of an angel.  This period drama explores how it was to be an entertainer and travel all over Europe at that time.  She and her brother were each other's companions.  Luckily, both loved music so endless performances and rehearsals came natural to them both.  The difference between the two was that in the time they lived, a boy had all possibilities open to him, while girl's options were quite limited.  It was unheard of for a woman to be a performer.  It was expected of her to be a mother and wife and if not that than she was to devote her life to God and church and become a nun.For most of her life, Nanerl devoted her life to tending to her father and his needs.  To some such demanding father may seem cruel; to others this father tried to teach his children music, grow their love for music and be a firm disciplinarian in order to ensure the highest level of music they presented in front of various european rulers.  He also had to adapt to the fact that his children will grow up into adults and that more permanent way of living arrangements and income flow will have to be secured for the family.  Not an easy task.There are beautiful costumes, make-up and interior design in this movie.  Music is fabulous too.  The shortcoming of this movie is that some of the scenes that involve singing and performing are so poorly dubbed it is impossible to ignore it.

$review_text.: Jan and Todd Wolfhouse are two american boys who are grieving the loss of their beloved grandfather.  His dying wish is for them to go to Germany (the old country) and spread his ashes during octoberfest...or so they think.  They meet their guide to go to the specific location in Munich to deposit the ashes, and he leads them to a secret location, and to BEERFEST.  At that time, they meet thier cousins, the Von Wolfhusen family, and uncover their shameful family secret.  Now, for the honor of their family, they must train and win at BEERFEST.  Together, with the competative eater "Landfill", The Jock who always "one upped" them in highschool, and the College Boy to understand the science of the games, they set forth to take Germany by storm, with a lot of mayhem along the way.This movie is clever, whitty, and right along at the same quality as super troopers.  The humor is classic, and easilly related to anyone who has lived through highschool and college.  The whole concept for this movie is just original and darn funny.  If you liked super troopers, they picked right up in it's tradition.  Go see this movie.  Well worth the price of admission.

Yes, the first few minutes to me by surprise, completely unexpected. I then went back to Amazon and read more reviews. I had no idea what to expect then. Someone wrote: Don't try to understand it, because you won't. Just hang on and enjoy the ride (or something like that)Great advice. I actually loved it. There were so many amazing acts and the story line was way different, but totally enthralling. What a beautiful love story it is.

$review_text.: This is not a film about a psychopathic child, this is a film about the mother of a psychopathic child, its her story. Imagine what it must be like to be the mother of one of the Columbine shooters, imagine the guilt, this film deals how a woman lives with the sins of her son after he commits a heinous act.  We know from science that psychopaths are born not made and good decent parents can raise a psychopathic child but this woman, played brilliantly by Tilda Swinton, blames herself because she never liked her son, she didn't want him from the beginning.  The character blames herself because she knew all along that there was something wrong with her boy.  She goes on to punish herself by remaining in the town where everyone knows her story, taking a job that's beneath her and even eating her son's favorite sandwich ( strawberry jelly on white bread).  By the time this film ends you'll be exhausted by the weight of this woman's guilt, you'll feel the pressure of her anxiety and soul crushing loss.  Its not a terrifying film, its subtle and nuanced drawing a profile of the mother's existence and her choices.  Only Tilda Swinton could have tackled this role.  The child is depicted a pure evil and its impossible to have any sympathy or empathy for him except at the very end of the film when you realize he doesn't understand himself and didn't understand the motivations of his own actions.  Its only at the end do you question whether the child is really a psychopath or just a boy he reacted to the knowledge that he was never loved by his own mother.  The final scene brings up a lot of doubt as to whether he was really evil or behaving so because he knew his mother thought that of him.  Every action on his part seems designed to hurt his mother which is why he makes sure she's left alive to live with his actions.  This is a very intelligent script and not your pedestrian gore fest nor horror type movie highlighting the exploits of a psychopathic killer.

$REVIEW.: What possessed Peter Jackson, after seeing the script for King Kong, to go ahead with the project at all?I mean, the man has talent. After the LOTR trilogy, that is an indisputable fact. So why he'd want to turn this GODAWFUL movie script into an almost-three-hour "Epic" is something I'll never understand. Perhaps he wanted to remake the original, as he felt it ought to be seen. Fair enough. Perhaps he saw the scope of the premise and thought it would make a stunning film. That's understandable, too.But the whole point of the King Kong story is that it's a simple retelling of the Beauty and the Beast fairytale. Or The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Or The King and I. Or Mask. Or the Phantom of the Opera. Or... well, you get my point.What all those stories have in common are Characters. Characters, people that drive a story forward by the strength of their personalities in the face of physical adversity. So why, tell me, does the script for 'King Kong' completely and utterly disregard all but the most perfunctory characterisation, and instead regale us with lots of stupid, stupid dialogue (there's no nice way of saying that) and *really* lousy performances from the human actors involved??No, from a storytelling point of view, this is not a good movie. Naomi Watts is very pretty, but it appears to be a skin-deep talent: any old actress can scream and look lovelorn. Adrian Brody is hopelessly underutilised as the Good Guy, and lacks entirely the physical presence needed to pull off the mode of Hero. And Jack Black??! What the hell were the casting people thinking?? Jack Black, delivering the line "Beauty killed the Beast. ", the last bit of dialogue in the film, with all the conviction and skill of a rhinoceros attempting ballet. None of it works, none at all.Extras are pretty blah, too: it's not possible to form any sort of bond with the crew of the transport ship because there's no time devoted to developing them as characters in the film: we couldn't care less about Jamie Bell, Thoman Kretschmann or Colin Hanks' characters because we never get to see or hear them do anything that sets them apart from the rest of the crew. And the grossly racist pseudo-African tribal dance of the extremely savage Savages isn't powerful or effective: rather than looking like devotees of a strange Ape-cult, as they are supposed to, they look instead like rejects from a bad David Cronenberg film.Which leads me to the real star of the show: Kong himself. Motion actor Andy Serkis must be given credit where it's due: the Ape, for the most part, moves in a convincing manner. And the computer-generated image of him works, too - this is a character with more personality than all the human 'cast' put together. It is a dreadful shame then, that Jackson decided to camp it up: the wholly unnessecary scenes of visual fluffing (the over-long Jurassic Park Throwback fight with the dinosaurs, the schmalzy and cheap ice-skating scene) show the one major flaw in Jackson's directorial style: egotism. A man who is seen to be able to do no wrong is a danger to his profession, and, very unfortunately, 'King Kong' suffers the very worst excesses of a director in love with his own image:We have an hour before the Ape appears, during which the one-dimensional characters are not developed, and a dull-as-all-hell storm scene rages on for ten minutes more than it needed to.A lot, a surprisingly awful lot, of the CGI scenes look cheap and basic: most of the time Naomi Watts is in Kong's hand, she either looks like a rag doll, or like she's outlined in blue. The sailors running from the dinosaurs looks ridiculous: the shadows don't match the background. And the fight between Kong and the T-Rex suffers from that fatal flaw of all CGI/Live-Action blend movies: the animated characters move just a little too slowly to be believable.The acting stinks. I know, I complained about this before, but it's just so necessary to complain about it again. Jackson was clearly far, far more concerned with coaxing better performances out of his cameramen and special effects team than he was with his human players - and in a movie where the whole point of the story is that it's driven by the ignorance and evolution of man's attitudes towards physical appearances, that's a fatal flaw.This dual DVD set is, if you're into this sort of thing, the best option: the picture and sound quality are great and the extras are nice to own - but for the most of us, rental is more than enough to experience the titanic failure of 'King Kong'. It is superficial, it is flashy, it is too long, and it's most certainly hollow.A big disappointment.

$review_text.: I CONFESS. THE TITLE OF THIS REVIEW IS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING. IT REFERS TO THE SAM RAIMI/BRUCE CAMPBELL CONNECTION TO THE FILM AND NOT ANY POSSIBLE ZOMBIEFIED BIKERS. SORRY. WE WILL NOW RESUME OUR NORMALLY SCHEDULED REVIEW."His name was Bruce, and only the day before he and his men the Bourne Losers had been riding that desolate ribbon of highway through the Arizona desert searching vainly for the answers to existential questions about Life, Death, and Draft Beer. That was when Bruce first felt a rift in the delicate fabric of the Universe and he found himself staring into the dark heart of Destiny."Wow. Not your typical biker movie, huh?That florid prose serves as our first introduction to our hero, we've already met our narrator, a reporter from the Des Moines Daily who is on assignment covering a series of baby nappings that has been taking place throughout the Midwest. We've also briefly met the members of a gang of female bikers known as  Women of the Wolf (WOW for short) and their leader She Wolf as they forced the reporter (played by Barry Livingston) off the road. We suspect that they may not be nice.The Losers help the nameless reporter (played by Barry Livingston) out of his overturned car and he joins up with them for the night. While making popcorn around their campfire later that night, the Professor tells the reporter about Bruce's strange past. It seems that while in Viet Nam Bruce (played by Paul LeMat) had been hit by a mortar shell which special guest star George Plimpton had been unable to remove completely due to its proximity to the nerve cluster in his brain--something writer Ivan Raimi would know about due to his time spent as an emergency room physician in Youngstown, Ohio.Well,it seems that following that incident Bruce developed odd psychic abilities that were studied at MIT, which is where the Professor( played by Jon Menick) first met him. After that Bruce decided to leave on a Great Quest and everyone who believed in him ( his friends from Nam, the Prof etc) got up and followed him. The Quest? To Seek out Evil, Destroy the Evil, and find a really great lite beer.While all of this exposition is going on the WOW are sneaking up on an isolated farm house in the middle of the night...on their bikes...with the motors racing. They tippy toe into the house and grab two babies, despite the best effort of the parents, and (for good measure)they blow up the farm house with what look like home made beer can bombs on pull string detonators. I told you they didn't seems nice. She Wolf it seems leaves little girl babies in the forest to be raised by the wolves,and sells the little boys on the black market.Bruce meanwhile has picked up the scent of all this evil and the Losers, with the reporter in tow, are on their way deeper into heart of Iowa.Soon enough the two gangs meet. Bruce doesn't recognize the evil in She Wolf (Eileen Davidson) when he first encounters her at a gas station.  They exchange steamy double entendres and then go their separate ways.I'm not going to tell you what happens next! You'll have to find a copy  of this obscure little gem and see that for yourself. But rest assured that the Bourne Losers are the most likable biker gang you'll ever encounter and you're gonna miss them when they ride off into the sunset. Yes, there's a lot to enjoy in this unassuming little comedy that is more than it seems to be. There is even a playful swipe at Eileen Davidson's career as a soap opera star if you look, or should I say listen closely?  And there are plot twists and revelations aplenty before we get to the ultimate showdown between Good and Evil in this hilarious comedy that reminds me of very early Coen Brothers, and why shouldn't it? After all the Raimis and the Coens worked together long before any of them were anybody!Please hunt it down and give it a try. You will be so happy that you did!EASY WHEELSDirected by David O'MalleyWritten by Ivan Raimi, Celia Abrams*, and David O;MalleyExecutive Producers: Rob Tapert and Bruce CampbellStarring: Payl Le Mat, Barry Livingston, Eileen Davidson, Theresa Randle, Jami Richards, Marjorie Bransfield, Karen Russell, Jon Menick, Carlos Compean, Joe Shea, and Ted Raimi*Celia Abrams  may be a pen name for Sam Raimi.

$REVIEW.: This original movie version of Shirley Jackson's highly esteemed novel &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; is definitely the finer;it faithfully follows the novel and captures it's intended creepiness.  Handsome Richard Johnson plays Doctor Markway (Montague in the book) who  invites three people to work as his assistants while doing psychic research  in an old New England house reputed to be haunted. Eleanor is lonely,timid  and impressionable;she spent eleven years caring for her invalid mother and  at 32,has never had a life of her own. Theodora is beautiful, bright and  vivacious;conscience to her is an attribute which properly belongs to girl  scouts-she's Eleanor's free-spirited opposite. The scene where the two  women, trembling from the cold, clinging to each other in bed as SOMETHING  is knocking at the bedroom door is genuinely chilling. When asked by Luke  (Russ Tamblyn) and Dr.Markway what happened the two women look at each  other in disbelief and Eleanor says &quot;Nothing in particular. Someone  just knocked on the door with a canonball, then laughed their fool head off  when we would'nt let them in,but nothing out of the ordinary!&quot;. As  Eleanor drifts slowly into dementia, it is obvious that the house becomes  her lover. If &quot;The Haunting&quot; is viewed on television, it's effect  is considerably enhanced if seen alone.

$REVIEW.: Stephen Daldry's "The Hours" is one of the more courageous and thought-provoking cinematic works of recent years


You will literally be thinking about the many themes this film covers for days to come after seeing it
While events never truly repeat themselves from era to era, there are certain experiences that remain constant


Such experiences echo throughout time but take on a new shape with each succeeding generation."The Hours" features three story arcs: the first is set in the 1940's and features author Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), the second is set in the 1950's and features housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), and the last is set in 2001 and features modern woman Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep)


All three women project strong facades to the outer world although each of them is suffering inside


The pressures of conforming to the role of nurturer expected of them continuously clashes with the cultural and social liberation they so desperately crave

There is sadness, despair, and guilt in all of these women's lives and the cold indifference in which their male companions regard their suffering forces them to seek support physically and spiritually in other women.&quot;The Hours&quot; does not directly link the three separate arcs together in any conventional narrative


The three stories exist to illustrate how events throughout time rhyme with each other rather than truly repeat themselves


This film provides unique, but indirect, insights into the female experience through nuance and metaphor

It will therefore prove disorienting to those used to more straightforward styles of storytelling

However, those interested in sampling something different will be rewarded with an emotionally powerful viewing experience

The cast is astonishing with Kidman, Moore, and Streep all showing why they are considered three of the best actresses working today


The supporting cast of Stephen Dillane, John C
Reilly, Allison Janney, Claire Danes, Ed Harris have enough talent themselves to headline their own film but distinguish themselves well in strong supporting performances
Mention must also be made of Philip Glass' musical score which works to accentuate the strong emotional states of the film's various characters


All in all, "The Hours" is an impressive feat of filmmaking that will not easily fade from memory.

Hilariously funny, the message is of love is conveyed well - where you don't always get what you want, but sometimes a trick of fate happens when we least expect it. The story line has relevance and periodicity in the gay culture. Cast really complimented each other quite well. Moreover, it is nice to see a race that is so misrepresented and misunderstood portrayed in a volatile way, beyond the hustler who is just looking for only a one night stand; rather, love is the optimal objective.

$REVIEW.: When I got ready to watch this again prior to seeing "Iron Man 3" I was really looking forward to it and I realized that I wasn't even thinking about the scenes like Iron Man and WarMachine duking it out or the incredible money shot of Whiplash slicing the racing cars in Monaco in half
 Nope
 I was looking forward to watching the the charactors playing off of each other, the actors acting

 Yes
 In a comic book movie

 And I kind of chuckled to myself.But it's true, if you haven't seen the Iron Man movies and have written them off as "comic book lowbrow popcorn films" then you have missed a couple of good movies with very good (accomplished) actors performing their craft in a winning way
 I was most looking forward to watching Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr., in case you don't live on planet earth) play matchwits with Pepper Potts (a very lovely Gwyneth Paltrow); to Tony Stark try to keep from making inappropriate advances on new assistant Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson, a.k.a


the undercover SHIELD operative Black Widow); to Ivan Vanko, the main villain of the film, played with actual subtlety and nuance by Mickey Rourke--he wasn't flashy but he did a great job
 But perhaps most of all I was ready to see Sam Rockwell's motormouthed nervous talker used car/ arms dealer salesman Justin Hammer spin his gums in his futile attempt to "be cool"; he really was so much of this film's comedy and he was just funny.But this is a superhero movie, right?  Yes, and we get the requisite superhero action but perhaps not as much as you'd think

 And that's a good thing because the movie takes its time to craft the characters, those inhabiting the suits and those who aren't, and makes us care at least a little bit about them

 Is this sequel as good as its predecessor?  I don't think so, but I do think that it is very good and compelling though there are a lot of storylines to keep track of in the film (a criticism I heard a lot of at the time of its release)

 The point is there is actually a lot of story and character here, and as I watched it again I was delighted several times to see some things that I had missed before
 Like Tony did in this movie you might find the cure for what ails you.

$REVIEW.: When our family (grown kids now living in several different cities) gets together for a holiday, one thing always on the agenda is to watch ISHTAR!  It's our favorite movie

 We just watched it again
 When our kids were younger, they had most of the dialogue memorized.I am always baffled by the bad rap this movie got


 It's funny and creative and an enjoyable movie to watch

 Almost everyone I've talked to who actually WATCHED it, loved it!  If you avoided this movie because of it's undeserved bad reputation, I'd urge you to give it a try!



$SUMMARY.: Our whole family loves this movie!

$REVIEW.: Pirates of the Caribbean is a action adventure story set in an era when villainous pirates scavenged the Caribbean seas. This  tale teams a young man, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), with an unlikely ally in rogue pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together, they must battle a band of the world's most treacherous pirates, led by the cursed Captain Barbossa, in order to save Elizabeth, the love of Will's life, as well as recover the lost treasure that Jack seeks. Against improbable odds, they race towards a thrilling, climactic confrontation on the mysterious Isla de Muerta. Clashing their swords in fiece mortal combat, Will and Jack attempt to recapture The Black Pearl ship, save the British navy and relinquish a fortune in forbidden treasure thereby lifting the curse of the Pirates of the Caribbean.Very few movies I've seen deserve 5 stars; if I could, I'd gives this movie more.  It has been ages since I've seen Johnny Depp in anything, and he played Capt. Jack Sparrow extremely well.  The attention to detail in this movie was amazing!  When the pirates moved into the moonlight, you saw them as skeletons.. even if an arm was only in the light.  It was amazing.
$SUMMARY.: Absolutely Brilliant

 A must see!

The director did a good job making a good dark, gritty feel to the movie, but needed to make a different ending.  I wouldn't recommend buying this, but renting it is probably best if you're still debating to watch it or not.

$REVIEW.: I've watched the series more than once. It continues to stun and enlighten me. It is both about the men who fought the war and the battles they fought. I learned a great deal about the European campaign from watching this and then researching the things that were new to me.The introductions and then the full interviews with the Veterans is not to be missed. These men are so honest in their emotions, their memories and about the job they did in fighting for years for our country. They are all to be admired.Anyone interested in WWII--both battles and about the men who fought them--has got to watch this series.

$review_text.: Many movies have told the story of the mysterious unknown hunter tracking human prey. Even though you've seen the premise before, you'll find yourself holding your breath as you watch this film.Quim (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is making a road trip to see his ex-girlfriend and maybe patch things up between them. He stops for gas and has an encounter with Bea (Mar&iacute;a Valverde). He realizes too late that Bea has stolen his wallet. So, when he sees her car ahead in the distance he decides to follow her.This is a particularly deserted stretch of road that winds through the forests and mountains of rural Spain. Both Quim and Bea are stranded when their cars are disabled by gunshots. Together they flee into the forest to escape their relentless pursuers.There are some surprising twists and turns in the plot. To say more would give away too much."King of the Hill" is very well made. The cinematography is stunning. Sbaraglia and Valverde took home the Festival Trophy for Best Actor and Actress at the 2008 Screamfest in LA for their performances. Director Gonzalo L&oacute;pez-Gallego won the Grand Prize of European Fantasy Film in Silver at the 2008 Amsterdam Fantastic Film Festival.The DVD has audio in either Spanish or English; subtitles are available in Spanish and English. There is also captioning in English for the hearing impaired. Do yourself a favor and skip the dubbed version. The original Spanish version is far, far superior. You'll catch a lot more emotion with the original language track, even if you're using subtitles.Parents should be aware that, although the DVD is unrated, the theatrical release had a well deserved "R" rating for sex and violence. The movie is disturbing. There are no noble or heroic characters here.

$REVIEW.: This murder mystery is very convoluted and moves so slowly at first that it is hard to follow. Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is a struggling actor who has landed the part of a vampire in a low-budget movie. When he comes home and discovers his live-in girlfriend having a sexual romp in their bedroom, he is suddenly homeless. In an attempt to advance his career, he takes acting lessons and interviews for parts.To his apparent good fortune, he meets another actor and is asked to take over a housesitting assignment. The deal appears even better when he is told that every evening at the same time one of the neighbor women does a semi-naked exotic dance. However, once Scully sees that another man is also watching he grows concerned for her safety.Scully follows the woman in an extremely clumsy manner. When the other man that is following her snatches her purse, he pursues the man and gets the purse back. However, his extreme claustrophobia overcomes him in a tunnel and he cannot recover her key to access her house.Scully then witnesses an Indian attacking and murdering the woman and that sends him on a journey into the dark world of porn. He manages to land a significant part in a film, where he meets porn star Holly Body (Melanie Griffith). The land of porn gives Scully some ideas, but the loose ends are not tied up until the last 15 minutes or so. The conclusion is an unusual one, extending beyond the literal unmasking of the real killer.The somewhat bizarre nature of having two movies inside a movie makes this one hard to follow at times. You are really required to think and there are a few distracters that are significant and at times difficult to believe. One of the best things about the movie is that even if you figure out who the real killer is, the final ten minutes is so unusual that it is impossible to anticipate.

$REVIEW.: In the wake of Charlton Heston's death, I decided to have a marathon viewing of his films. I rewatched many of my favorites and sought out some of those I had never seen."El Cid" was one I had not watched before, probably because it only recently became available on DVD. As he often did, Heston plays a real-life character, an 11th-century Spanish hero who sought to unite his country. It is one of those epic historical films Heston specialized in, and it does a good job of conveying that time and place. Although set 1,000 years ago, the themes of the story still resonate today.One of the things I like about these films is that they were made pre-CGI, so they were generally shot on location and much of the spectacle was actually staged for the cameras (No computer-generated armies here).The Cid was a complex character and, unlike some of his other roles, Heston plays him in an understated way. The Cid was valiant and loyal, a selfless warrior loved by the people. He preached tolerance and tried to show that all Muslims were not evil. But he was humble and deferential to a fault, putting his sense of duty to country and king before everything, even his family.There are some grand action scenes: a spectacular jousting duel and several large scale battles. The musical score is sweeping and beautiful. Yes, there is some melodramatic acting in places, but overall the performances are good.The central love story did not work for me, however. The Cid's relationship with Chemene, played by Sophia Loren, is up and down throughout the film: first she loves him, then she hates him, then she loves him. They do not spend enough time together to make a convincing case that this was a great love affair.If you like behind-the-scenes features, there are several interesting documentaries on the second disc: one deals with the making of the film, then there are bios of the producer, the director, the composer, and an odd little piece on some guy who works in film preservation.All in all I would recommend "El Cid" to anyone who likes Charlton Heston and big historical films. As they say, they don't make `em like this anymore.

It almost takes as  much time to read the titles of the featurettes as to watch them


 The Curt Schilling  a  Legend on a Legend is a whopping  2 minutes.If you don't  have the movie this is certainly the one to buy...if you do and  you just have to  have every scrap on Gehrig..then go for it
 If you want to learn more ..I'd invest in the Yankeeology DVD with an hour on Lou Gehrig...its got this beat by a mile.

$REVIEW.: Well, my major reason for buying this film is because I'm a big Rolling Stones fan and the plot seemed intriguing. When I first watched the first half of it, dealing with all those gangsters, I remember being really bored  and thinking &quot;I thought Mick Jagger was suppose to be in this  movie&quot; BUT after watching it a second time I realized both parts tie  together. The second half of the movie is the most interesting, and no, not  just because of Mick Jagger. It deals with Turner trying to warp and change  Chas' personality, and that is why Chas kills Turner in the end, for  intruding on his mind and personality. You have to watch it a few times to  really understand it though. Turner sees himself in Chas, at least who he  was when he was younger, before he lost his &quot;demon.&quot; Its a really  great movie and one of the only movies that Jagger is in that shows how  good he can act. James Fox is also a great actor and its too bad he went  crazy afterwards.

I was, and still am in love with the creativity,  the originality and the clever 'not-so-cliche-ness' of it all. The show was great... So when I heard there was a feature film called "Serenity"in the works, I was very excited.The movies feels like an enormous, well-budgeted mini series.. which is what I love about it most. The cast, visibly made 'more Hollywood' was superb in continuing the story that made this a cult favorite. From the very original story arc, to teh fantastic workings of the digital effects team... this movie is so much closer to the target when it comes to quality science fiction. A certain director of another 'war in space' set of movies.. could take notes.Please see this movie, love this movie, and own it when it comes to DVD. It is a forever favorite of mine.P.S.My only dissapointment.. why kill Shepard and Wash?

$review_text.: One of the greatest adventure films ever made, KING KONG has been one of a handful of films that have become an enduring icon of American popular culture and justly praised as a true motion picture classic; the film's lasting popularity is staggering! Since it's release in 1933, this film has become totally assimilated into American popular culture; it's become an American institution and is a very real figure to children and adults alike throughout the world. Max Steiner's score was actually one of the very first written entirely for any film and the trick photography during the making is legion, Kong, for instance, was all of eighteen inches. In 1976, 20 MILLION dollars was spent on an absolutely ludicrous version! An outstanding achievement in motion picture history, the Special Edition is clear and expertly colorized so get it and see for yourself!

$REVIEW.: A very entertaining show, surprising, sometimes deep, sometimes just enjoyable


A good mix of action, of suspense and a bit of humor as well


Though sometimes relying a bit too much on the supposed IT skills of one, and the martial arts of the other, the show mixes increasingly recurring characters (cops, Zoe, Leon..

and Bear) and new comers
The background is sometimes hinting at The Wire (deeper intrigues, politics, corruption), but stays on the easy watching and action side.Just like candies, it is nice to have a few, but not too much at the same time ! :)

$review_text.: Among the many things relating to &#34;911&#34; that might be classified as &#34;scary,&#34; by far the scariest is the simple fact that the truth of what happened was right there, staring everyone in the face, all along


 As this documentary painstakingly demonstrates, the very elements - atoms, molecules, metals and minerals comprising the buildings and planes - all point away from anything and everything laid out in the &#34;Official&#34; version and inescapably toward the use of explosives to bring the buildings down


Of course, many have already made the very arguments made in this documentary, but none have made these arguments so compellingly.Other than providing more than adequate evidence to support the controlled demolition dynamic, there is no agenda here
 No one is being blamed, no one is being exonerated


 Rather, the &#34;chips&#34; are allowed to fall wherever they may
 Step by step, each argument presented by the supporters of the &#34;Official&#34; version is examined and, ultimately, rejected as its various components are shown to be untenable
 And, along with the &#34;Official&#34; arguments, the smug self-assurance of their proponents is left to free fall into oblivion.This is truly the &#34;Gold Standard&#34; of &#34;911&#34; documentaries

 And, at the end, it's left to the viewer to decide if the case presented is valid
 There's no attempt to shove anything down people's throats, or to impugn anyone who fails to agree with the film maker's presentation


 There doesn't have to be: the evidence says it all.

$review_text.: The American Civil War, fought from 1861 to 1865, would have a profound effect on the country both during and after the war. One of probably the biggest effects the war would create on the people both in the north and south was dealing with death. For the first time Americans had to suddenly deal with death on a large scale. As the war dragged on and battle after battle producing thousands of dead soldiers that had to be dealt with Americans came to see and deal with death in a whole new way. Neither side at the beginning of the war had any kind of system to clear the dead from the battlefield or dispose of the bodies. But it soon became clear something had to be done to help relieve the problems that the military and its citizens came face to face with with the end of every battle.&#34;American Experience: Death and The Civil War&#34; looks at the situations that would arise from the war and how it would come to effect everyone and how it would change their views on death and dying. This is a grim subject matter to be sure. However it is an interesting look at how American society would come to change how it looked at death and prepared for it. I am a history nerd and a Civil War buff so I am sure this is something only historians would only find interesting to watch. It is I will admit a bit slow and dull at places but I would still recommend this to anyone to watch whether you are into history or not. Though a grim subject this documentary is still an interesting and important look at how an event like the Civil War would effect the country then and still effects the country today 150 years after the end of the war.

$REVIEW.: Released by Anchor Bay this 4 disc set (3 blu-ray's & 1 DVD) is a must own for fans of the movie. This set includes the theatrical release plus the directors cut of Battle Royale and also includes Battle Royale 2.The 4th disc the DVD has plenty of behind the scenes and trailers. The video and audio is excellent on the films and while it may not be the greatest its still very good and what we've come to know on the blu-ray format.The 2nd movie is only subtitled as there is no English dub, which is fine by me but I cant see that stopping someone from owning this set.The one complaint is while I love the package design and it actually looks like a book and if you remove the slipcase nobody would realize this wasnt a book until they opened it.My complaint is instead of cases the discs are in cardboard slips, which are slightly difficult to get out and put back in. However unlike the debackle from Universal with the Back to the Future trilogy this usnt nearly as bad and you can get the discs out without touching the back and getting fingerprints on it. I would advise extra care but its not as bad as it seems.Overall this set by Anchor Bay is a winner in terms of audio and video as well as transfers and while this may not be the crown jewel of your collection it is an excellent one

$REVIEW.: 3.5 stars.  The Amazon.com movie synopsis above is dead-on here.  This is a generic romantic-comedy with typical characters that are predictable and two-dimensional.  Except for the character of "Mike" played with impeccable comic timing by Ryan Reynolds.  I laughed hysterically at his scenes, nearly in tears at times, while only mildly chuckling at the situations and/or antics of the other characters. His time here is sparkling and is the epitome of comedic professionalism.  When you have a supporting role in an otherwise average film, you should make the most of it; and on the strength of his performance alone I can recommend this film.  As for the appearance of Alyssa Milano, she looked alluring as usual, but was otherwise just another disposable bimbo-type character that could have been played by thousands of other actresses with breast implants like hers.  Not to belittle her talent, but she has no scenes here worth mentioning.  As for her acting ability, try watching her television show "Charmed."  But for all the raging heterosexuals out there who want to see more of her "talent," you should all buy "Embrace of the Vampire."  She is absolutely luscious in that movie.  Overall, this film is typical romantic-comedy fare with a dash of comic genius via Ryan Reynolds.

$REVIEW.: The main problem with this film is there's just way too many songs- and NONE are enjoyable.With the focus of the movie being music, there really wasn't much done with the actual story. The plot is great- a young girl who wants to become a knight like her father (who was killed) goes on a quest to find the legendary sword, Excalibur, which was stolen and lost in the forest. They could have done so much  with this plot if they only left out all the music! Reading the description on the back of the box is much more enjoyable than actually watching how they ruined what could've been a really good film.

H.G awaits the arrival of a friend, John, before revealing his newest creation, a Time machine
Shortly after Johns arrival, the police arrive tracking the Ripper

They find John's doctor bag, which has evidence that he is the ripper


But Where's John? well, he disappeared...into time


He hitched a ride in H.G
Well's time machine
Now he is set loose on 1979 san fransico


H.G
Wells takes it upon himself to go to the future and track him down, fearing that he is disrupting the Utopian society that Well believes exists
Moving foreward through time, Wells is shocked to find the world is not a utopia as promised, and things have sped up quite a bit
Wells is befriended by a bank Teller, Amy, who helps him locate John
Amy eventually all but throws herself at H.G
Wells because he's cute, but in the end, she puts herself in danger because the ripper is after H.G

for the Key to permanently control the time machine


I won't destroy the rest of the plot

I take the movie at face value, and its not bad
But, if you want to tear it apart, why the heck doesn't Jack the ripper (John) just kill H.G


at the beginning, and steal the key


Instead, he spends half the movie running away from scrawny little H.G


wells
And the love line with Amy, I guess the seventies were much more free with love, a bank teller just throws herself after a 5 minute visit at H.G

wells, spend an entire day together, and they get hooked up

Oh well, its a movie about time travel
Still a fair job
A neat idea, but maybe overdone on the love stuff


Worth a viewing, and a late night semi-cult classic.

$REVIEW.: i was lucky enough to get a copy on blu ray from a small video website for 30 bucks, don't asked they are now sold out, (i tried to get the dvd version, thats how i know). and i have to say this is the best version of DAM period. after the crappy ADV release this is just great and i'm sorry but i love the AIP dub version! so much better and less cheese then the international. if you get this blu ray you will not be sorry, but its price tag is high, with this version being pulled from the stores, i asked mediablasters on their facebook page if they would release just a barebones copy of this on blu ray they responded with "if toho allows us to." so i don't know if it will happen anytime soon. i would like it on dvd, though. i don't see the price coming down on this unless rereleased by mediablasters, being its one of the favorite godzilla movies, its the best quality, and its never been released in japan on blu ray and their blu ray is the same region as ours. so you could wait it out and see if it gets rereleased or you could spend a lot of money on it. but the waiting game might be a long one since mediablasters is suppose to release megalon on blu ray and thats not here yet. but if you do buy it you will not be disappointed.****update**** I just received a copy of the new Destroy all Monsters dvd, I got from walmart.com. it does not have the AIP DUB. its the international English 2.0, Japanese 5.1, and Japanese 2.0. there are no special features on this release. the menu screen looks different from my blu ray version. it is in widescreen though.

$REVIEW.: THE GAME is another wonderful Michael Douglas film and I rate it at 5 stars


This film will really be appreciated by fans that enjoy dissecting a complex plot


The story, although hard to swallow and farfetched, was exceptionally engaging and kept my interest from start to finish
I thought on my first viewing that this film would have a sequel, but was proven wrong by events.THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COULD RUIN ENJOYMENT OF THE PLOT:Nicholas Van Orton played by Michael Douglas is a wealthy banker, but a loner who even spends his birthday away from people


In the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed suicide and on the verge of classic mid-life crisis) his distant brother gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS)

Giving in to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of weird things start to happen to him

Prior to admitting him to participate he is required to take a series of mental and physical tests which were apparently run to determine his strengths, weaknesses, and perhaps map out some sort of efficient "game plan" tailored just for him


One statement I remember CRS telling him is that if you don't go to THE GAME, it will come to you.He receives a phone call telling him that he failed the tests and is rejected by the organization


He forgets about CRS, but then overhears several people talking about "the game" and what life-changing opportunities it provides
He notices several such "loud" conversations in public, and goes to the trouble of introducing himself and speaking with a couple of apparently new members of his private club


All they will tell him is they wish they were just starting "the game" and one man quotes the bible saying "where I was once blind I now can see"
Once he is certain he has actually been admitted to THE GAME, he tries to return to the offices of CRS where he received his tests, only to find that no signs of their facilities remain and for all effects, this organization never even "existed".This initially "mild" form of harassment (i.e., being misinformed of his membership status, having drinks spilled on him in restaurants, strange people banging into him, folks behaving very strangely in rest rooms and other public places, empty toilets overflowing, his attach&eacute; case jamming at important business meetings, the pen CRS told him to keep leaking on his shirt, individuals collapsing in the street at his feet, etc.), gradually transitions to increasingly overt and often potentially life-threatening experiences which slowly work on his mental condition
All the more strange is the fact that he is provided the means of barely escaping his next experience by receiving an item or remembering a fact he learned during a prior event

 Some examples of these increasingly life threatening events include: his estate being broken into and ransacked, being stranded in a darkened elevator, his cab driver driving his CRS taxi into the river almost drowning him, large crowds of people disappearing in a coordinated way from public places, being drugged, attacked by hooded gun men emerging from a large van marked Cable Repair Services, abducted and ultimately waking up in a crypt and stranded without cash, credit cards or passport in Mexico).The mental harassment is designed at first to merely embarrass or make uncomfortable, mildly inconvenience, then to be serious and painful, and after enough repetition and conditioning for him to associate these strange events, to effectively torture and eventually drive insane


Since almost every detail is staged redundantly there are no correct decisions left for him to make, and no avoiding the sequence of painful situations
He is ultimately like a caged animal walking wall to wall in a classic avoidance-avoidance conflict leading to insanity

 The issue of the cost-effectiveness of this game plan is something the film never addresses, but we are too engrossed to think about this during the movie.One thing is certain, these people do not want to publicly kill him or leave any permanent record of injury due to anything other than a random event
The purpose of THE GAME seems not to be simple murder, but to professionally destroy, discredit and cause a very gradual physical and mental breakdown which will result in his being either jailed because of acting out displaced aggressions, hospitalized or institutionalized where he can "die" or be subjected to something while well out of public scrutiny.In his former professional life he could certainly have made enemies, and what better means could they use to destroy him with impunity? While his financial and mental conditions still enable him to investigate CRS, he believes he acquires "evidence" that one of the office workers at CRS was a hired professional actor, more likely to have been provided by Actors Equity than some private detective or intelligence agency (CIA?)
As the story unfolds this evidence was probably "fed" to him as part of the plot which is just full of strange twists and complications, all leading him no place.His entire personality changes as he undergoes transformation from a strong business-world predator to the cowering subject of physical and mental harassment

It is sad but interesting to watch his gradual disintegration as forces outside of his control consume him

The ending was a bit strange and is the reason I thought there would be a sequel.IF THE ABOVE MATERIAL CAN RUIN THE ENDING THE FOLLOWING IS WORSE:The film can only be said to have a rediculous ending when Van Orton confronts his brother who he now believes is in on the game plan on the roof of the CRS building

 At the end of the story after Van Orton believes he has shot his brother he actually jumps off the roof of the high rise CRS building intent on suicide because of his grief
 He is surprised to learn after smashing through the break away glass of a fake skylight, that he safely lands on a huge airbag carefully placed to break his tremendous fall
 He then sees his resurrected brother and all the other people dressed up in black tie to celebrate his birthday
 It was, after all, just a "harmless" gag.At the end of the story there are no hard feelings and all gracious smiles as he is presented with the check for the elaborate hoaxes that CRS has staged for his "entertainment"


Even though he has probably aged over 30 years as a result of continuous mental trauma in just a number of days, he goes from table to table thanking the guests for making it a very special party
He even asks out the very beautiful and treacherous lady who slipped him a mickey during the ordeal
Well, the film was too entertaining for that very weak and silly ending to ruin it, but it did erode what I thought was (up until then) a very well done and thought out thriller.

$review_text.: When I first heard about this movie I really thought it was going to be a true Disney Children's movie. I was amazed and maybe even a little disappointed that I would not be able to share this movie with my grand children. That being said it definitely not a children's movie but it was a wonderful mature version of a classic. While another review , who claims to be a " Christmas Story " aficionado really cuts the movie as a one star movie. They themselves even admit that the dialog is inline with the writing in the book. But I myself loved the visual adaptation and enjoyed the introduction of new visual aspects of the movie. I did not see the 3d version of the movie, I'm not really into the 3d yet, but I can see how a lot of what was added to the movie would have been awesome in 3d. All that said I thought Jim Carrey was amazing in portraying all the different characters that he did. And if you take the time to view the extras on the DVD you may actually come to appreciate more just how  Robert Zemeckis (Director) did an amazing adaptation of this story. Bottom line..... not a small child's movie but a wonderful rendition of a classic for the adults.Thanks Mr Zemeckis

$review_text.: Some critics have absolutely no clue!  'Waterworld' is a GREAT 'apocalyptic genre' sci-fi action movie, with a highly original plot and great action.  As far as I know, no once else before had attempted a movie based on the premise that our Earth had experienced a mass melting of our polar ice caps, which in turn submerged almost the whole planet, and made basic survival challenging.  Granted though, much of the film's post-apocalyptic desperation and fighting for survival in a world of scarce commodities reminded me of the the 'Mad Max' series, especially with the tone and color of the set decorations, but that's OK and to be expected with this kind of plot.  Costner, Hopper, and Tripplehorn were first rate with convincing roles, and I really enjoyed the hopeful ending.  The elaborately constructed, surreal sets and costumes alone make this film a surefire bet!
$SUMMARY.: Excellent, unique, and HIGHLY ORIGINAL sci-fi movie!

$REVIEW.: Before Blu-ray, the very best home video version of Vertigo was the anamorphic DVD that Universal sold only as one of the 14 Hitchcock titles in the Masterpiece Collection. (I believe this collection also had the only anamorphic DVD version of Psycho.) It appears that Universal has released its Blu-ray version of Vertigo only as part of two collections: The Masterpiece and The Essentials collections.I am glad that Universal has made Vertigo available in its far less expensive Essentials Blu-ray collection. In my opinion, Vertigo is not the greatest film ever made, but it is of special interest to me because of its San Francisco locations and overall Bay Area setting. Vertigo, along with Shadow of a Doubt and The Birds may also be of interest to Northern California natives. Anyway, here are my quality ratings of the 5 films contained in the Essentials Collection in order of their appeal:1. North By Northwest: I have seen nearly every Hitchcock film and this one is my all time favorite. It features outstanding video quality in nearly every scene. The contrast is almost perfect, the picture detail is remarkably-clear and the color is about as good as it gets on Blu-ray. The North By Northwest disk in this collection is exactly the same as the Blu-ray disk from the Warner Bros. 50th Anniversary Edition, with two exceptions: The artwork on the disk is different and the option for selecting a music-only soundtrack is not available on the disk included in the Universal Essentials Collection. If you can do without Warner's 44-page book and the music-only soundtrack, the Universal Essentials Collection is the way to go for this title.2. Vertigo: This film has very good to excellent color and picture detail. The Blu-ray version is a giant leap ahead of the anamorphic DVD and the sound is greatly improved. In view of the challenges encountered during the restoration of this classic, the quality of this latest Vertigo release is nothing short of amazing and Kim Novak's entrance in Vertigo is absolutely breathtaking. While it remains one of my favorite movies, Vertigo still has two insurmountable obstacles for me. First, I have trouble believing that shop girl Judy Barton could transform herself into a sophisticated Madeleine Elster. Second, I have no trouble believing that 50 year old 'Scottie' Ferguson could fall for 25 year old Madeleine/Judy, but I don't see how she could have fallen for him.3. Rear Window: The elaborately-detailed set featured in this film requires fine detail and accurate color. This disk delivers on both counts. There are some variations in picture quality when scenes change, but the overall film presentation is very well done.4. Psycho: The look of this black and white film is clear and well-detailed, with good contrast and enough film grain to avoid that pasty look so common in other black and white films transferred to Blu-ray.5. The Birds: The dated special effects didn't transfer well to this high-definition format. Some scenes are very good, but others are not so good. This film is not one of my favorites, so I am not too concerned that it doesn't look all that great overall. Still, the film is highly-watchable and the great improvement over its DVD predecessor is a welcome change. If this is one of your favorite Hitchcock films, you will be able to overlook the flaws.After reading the one-star reviews from 2011, I finally noticed that Amazon has mixed the Blu-ray and DVD reviews together. If I hadn't noticed this important fact, I would have been under the impression that these five Hitchcock Blu-ray disks from the Essentials Collection were made from out of date, vastly-inferior recycled masters. Then I discovered that Vertigo was first released on Blu-ray in October 2012. I already owned North By Northwest, which was released by Warner Bros. in 2009 and this disk is one of the finest Blu-ray releases that I have ever seen. So, when reading the reviews, keep in mind that many of them are for the DVD collection.
$SUMMARY.: In Search of VERTIGO.

In the cast are Alec Newman (Tv's Angel, Children Of Dune) and Lukas Haas (Mars Attacks, Boys). It's a bit of this and its a bit of that. The killings are predictable and the girls are so annoying with the screaming. Didnt we get enough of those Djinn a-holes from The Wishmaster movies?

$REVIEW.: Scripted by Oliver Stone, "Year of the Dragon" is a dark, edgy, and complex action film rich in weighty character study and politically incorrect social issues. Working with a huge budget, award winning director Michael Cimino suavely glides his camera through gorgeous detailed sets that range from elaborate urban settings to drab suburban trappings and even exotic global locations. Despite the early 80s setting and a few dated hair cuts, the film is strangely timeless, drawing heavily from the gritty look of classic gangster films. The shoot outs and chase sequences are small scale and spacious but bloody and shocking when they erupt at unexpected moments, escalating in brutality and emotional impact as the film progresses. There's also some impressive real car wreckage you just don't see in modern films.Already world weary and battle scarred, Mickey Rourke dominates the movie as its morally ambiguous protagonist, delivering a charismatic but layered performance that demands the audience understand him even if they don't completely like everything about him. He comes across as racist, sexist, and selfish but also genuinely tragic and heroic. The physicality he brings to the role is also impressive; his crude realistic punches putting the decade's bigger action stars to shame. The soft spoken John Lone is as classy and unusual as villains get, ruthless but cool and oddly likable. Tall husky voiced, Ariane Koizumi gives a strong supporting performance as Rourke's reluctant lover, their anti-cliche romance seeming geniune despite an emotional distance on the surface. Dennis Dun also shines in a brief but sympathetic role.-Dan S. of dangerdiablogik

$REVIEW.: Jackass presents Bad Grandpa made me and my brother laugh so hard we cry in mutiple scenes
 He bought it for my birthday and I watch it and again laugh very hard in the same scenes from the movie theathre


 If your a fan of Jackass stunts and humor then you will very much enjoy what this movie has to offer their fans

 But as fair warning to their fans their is many touching scenes between the grandson and the the Grandpa,  I will give you the example that made me actual cry was near the end of the movie with the bikers gang that take care of kids from bad parents and the one biker guy told Grandpa &#34;no matter what that boy will be taken care of.&#34;  I might be in my 30's but still a touching scene hit home in my heart
 But as for myself the scene that made me laugh the strongest was (spoiler) the talent show to find a girl to be a new princess and grandson posing as a girl to win the contest

 Still overall a great movie for laughs, touching moments between family memebers, and proves Johnny Knoxville can hit homerun with the laughs and at times be a serious actor in some of the scenes.

She is always looking for a way to better her prospects without going through the trouble of bettering herself.George Segal plays a con-man and gambler. He doesn't like the violent stuff but will take part if forced into it. He like decorative women and Goldie Hawn has definitely caught his eye. The problem is that she sees him as just another trick and, when she learns about some of his loot, another mark to be fleeced.Segal had taken part in a bank robbery by distracting the wife of the bank manager. When the robbery gang is pursued, he is doubled crossed and left behind without any of the loot. He was expecting the double cross, however, and he really has all of the loot while the robbers get away only with horse nuggets. This leads to a precarious state of affairs. The robbers are after Segal who has to leave the country. Segal is after Hawn who is herself after the contents of his black bag. Eventually, Segal and Hawn wind up together against everyone else to secure their fair share of their ill gotten gains.The whole thing is done with a sense of humor and is amusing to watch. It is fun.

$REVIEW.: Bella Mafia ( 1997 ) featuring the legendary Franco Nero andNastassja Kinski,  coupled with a litany of almost equally rabidcharismatic actors, such as  Jennifer Tilly, Debbis Farina, andJames Marsden, is definitely worth a rental or purchase!The strong point of the movie concerns the rivalry between 2Sicilian clans, in particular the natural struggle between them.and the conflicts in how they interpret and process rules,regulations (mores, norms, if you will) stemming from traditionshanded down over centuries over many generations surroundingrelations between people, and the black sheep in a family, etc.Another strength, is the dramatic nature of the story, a few timescoming close to over-reaching, (but never reaching that point) fromthe extreme behavior seen at various points and at several times inthe story, such as rubouts, the methods, the bloodlineintermarriages, business negotiations.The filming is flawless, the charisma of the casting spotless...impressive.On the other hand, admittedly, there is a quick pace in the storydevelopment, at times complex to follow.Alos, perhaps more music could have been added, and a more roundedstoryline at times, to make it more palatable to a larger audience,could have been the case.Overall, definitely a keeper for those with even a modest interestin dramatic, underworld movies. In other words, a classic.

$review_text.: Every time I come back from overseas landing at any US airports, I was amazed to see, 7 out of 10 people at the airport are obese as compared with my experiences at airports in Asia, Europe and South America. While overseas, I can easily spot an American from other Europeans or Euro people (one clue: Americans are HUGE in body shape).  In America, we have people so fat that at Safeway, they provide automated carts for obese people to ride/use, a phenomenon you don't see in other countries.  This movie provides ONE major reason why Americans are so grossly obese.  I don't think it it is the evil "corporate" that made us obese. The American diet in general are very unhealthy as opposed to an Italian, French, Brazilian and Chinese diet (countries I visited frequent).  Nonetheless, this is an eye opening movie and I hope parents go to see this with their children.
$review_summary.: Great Movie.  Should be seen with the whole family.

$review_text.: Good and fairly realistic rendition of a doomsday scenario. I found myself wanting more (and that is good from a movie). Yes, the hollywood factor is still in there and it shows in some of the over the top action sequences, also the CGI is way too evident in the animals and creatures and tends to take away from  the whole experience (i am not a CGI fan). Overall: WELL DONE.
$SUMMARY.: Better than expected!

$REVIEW.: THE SAFETY OF OBJECTS is a superb film directed by Rose Troche from an correlative collection of stories by AM Homes and delivered with touching dignity by a cast of some of our best actresses - Glenn Close, Mary Kay Place, Patricia Carlson,  Moira Kelley - and supported by actors including Dermot Mulroney and Joshua Jackson and Timothy Olyphant.  Just as in her book by the same name, there are many stories happening simultaneously and in the film adaptation they all interrelate even more closely than the book suggested.  This is the suburbia madness Homes knows so well - four familties living adajacently and bonded in various degrees by the near fatal auto accident of Paul Gold, a youth in his prime who touched the lives of more people than he knew. In the film he continues in a vegetative state, binding his caregiving mother (Close), offering food for longing for his secret lover (Clarkson), and providing a seemingly endless search for normalcy by the one in the accident who wasn't physically injured (Olyphant). Secrets, longings, and fantasies  play strong roles in the lives of all of the characters who are very realistically written and acted and it is to Rose Troche's credit that she keeps us involved and guessing until the final frame. A very fine, very challenging piece of film making.

$REVIEW.: I had not heard of this band since I am from the East Coast
I happened to see them on Palladia & immediately went Wow, I have to have these guys music

They have all the old Southern rock influences along with country intelligence


I will say this is my favorite new band in a long time

This is classic Southern country/rock @ it's best.

$REVIEW.: If you, like me, have been waiting to get a Blu-ray release of The Jackal that has the audio commentary and extras on the Blu-ray, then you will have to wait longer. Universal originally released the film as a dreaded Blu-ray / DVD flipper discThe Jackal (Combo Blu-ray and Standard DVD), and while the extras were present on the DVD side, the Blu-ray side had nothing but the feature film. It appears they released the same disc again with a Digital Copy hereThe Jackal [Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy].I bought this double feature release (Mercury Rising / The Jackal Double Feature [Blu-ray]) because I wanted to watch the extras (and specifically, listen to the audio commentary) while watching the Blu-ray of The Jackal. Certain information I had read led me to believe that this release had a single-sided Blu-ray Disc with extras. As you can see from the product images I uploaded, the disc is a single-sided Blu-ray, but there are no extras anywhere on the disc, despite the fact that Universal have listed the extras on the back cover!I'm not sure why Universal simply won't master the disc again and include the extras and commentary, but they will be hearing from me about this release and hopefully I can get them to correct it.EDIT: I have just heard back from Universal after weeks of back-and-forth:Dear Sean,Thank you for providing the information that we requested. We have taken steps to correct the "Mercury Rising/The Jackal" Double Feature packaging.Unfortunately, the bonus features are not available on any Blu-ray release. We would like to send you the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack of "The Jackal," which as you noted includes these features on the DVD side:* The Making of The Jackal* Feature Commentary with Director Michael Caton-Jones* Production Notes* Cast and Filmmakers* Theatrical TrailerIf you would like this package, please let us know your address.Thank you.Sincerely,Consumer RelationsUNIVERSAL STUDIOS HOME ENTERTAINMENTI think this is ridiculous and have asked for a refund. There should be nothing stopping Universal from mastering this properly on Blu-ray with its extras.
$SUMMARY.: No extras on THE JACKAL
