$REVIEW.: When Star Trek: The Next Generation entered its third season, it was in trouble. The critical reception to the show's second year had been mixed, producer and effective showrunner (under Rick Berman) Maurice Hurley had left and the cast were unhappy with the removal of Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher. As the third season opened, Rick Berman had to hire a largely new writing team, a new showrunner and had to bring back McFadden to appease the rest of the cast (particularly Patrick Stewart). Fortunately for his show and for the fans, Berman was lucky. The new showrunner was the talented Michael Piller and amongst the new writers were the young and energetic Ira Steven Behr, Rene Echeverria and Ronald D. Moore, all of whom would go on to define Star Trek for many years to come.Because of these changes, Season 3 was produced in a state of chaos. Scripts were being completed mere days before filming, leaving little time for pre-production. This can be seen in the reduced amount of location filming this season, with almost no time to book location shoots ahead of filming. However, there's a noticeable improvement in special effects thanks to the introduction of new, smaller and easier-to-shoot filming models of both the Enterprise and the Romulan warbird (which makes several appearances). New, considerably more comfortable uniforms are also introduced, to the evident comfort and relief of the actors.But what really makes the season work is the superior writing. Piller was keen to introduce more scenes of character interaction and development to the show. The guest cast are moved away from being the centre of the show, with their impact on the regular characters being more important. There's more continuity, with a recurring Romulan threat throughout the season (The Enemy, The Defector, Tin Man) and Worf's Klingon background being developed more thoroughly (Sins of the Father). Having been proven to be a sentient being in Season 2's excellent The Measure of a Man, Data's evolution continues through several episodes before peaking in The Offspring, where he tries to build a new android 'daughter'. Comedy is allowed freer reign, particularly in Deja Q, Captain's Holiday and Menage a Troi, which all feature a few good laughs (Deja Q may be the funniest episode the show ever did).But the third season's strong reputation relies on its two absolute stand-out, inarguably, stone-cold classics. Yesterday's Enterprise is a time travel story involving parallel universes which remains fully comprehensible, features one of the best space battles the show ever did and finds an intelligent and non-cheesy way of bringing back Tasha Yar. The writing is strong, with lots of moments of subtlety (the alternate Riker and Picard don't get on) and some impressive production values and details, such as the revamping of the Enterprise bridge.At the end of the season we also get The Best of Both Worlds, the show's first season cliffhanger and still the best one Star Trek's ever done. The return of the Borg, the outstanding music, the character interplay between Riker and newcomer Shelby, the effects and the doom-laden, hopeless atmosphere combine to make for one of the franchise's finest hours.Conversely, there are only a few weak moments in the mix. The Price, The Vengeance Factor and The Most Toys are quite dull, whilst The High Ground is a commentary on the Northern Ireland Troubles which misfires completely due to the writers' poor understanding of that conflict. Who Watches the Watchers? sabotages a good premise and some excellent Enterprise scenes with some dull guest cast performances. But it's more surprising how good the show has become compared to the first two seasons, with even minor episodes like The Survivors and The Hunted coming to life and being enjoyable in a way the smaller stand-alones of the first two years struggled with.On a technical basis, the HD upscaling of the show is again amazing, with the same team that handled Season 1 doing the job. That means some more beautiful 3D planet renders, some outstanding effects recreations and superior reproductions of the show's colours (Season 3 is more colourful than the first two seasons). After the slightly disappointing Season 2 upgrade (the company responsible for that is not being re-used, interestingly), the S3 update is even more astonishing. For a season that was driven so much by writing changes, the extra features do a great job of focusing on the writing team and how they went about creating the best show possible and avoiding the mistakes of the first two years.Ultimately, the third season of Star Trek: The Next Generation (*****) is outstanding. The writers, actors and crew are all on the top of their game, dragging the so-so show of the first two seasons up in quality to become something truly impressive. The season is available now in the UK and USA.

$review_text.: This film appears to have been written pretty much to accentuate Zeta-Jones appeal, but there is much more to this film, and even in its sensual parts it really does keep itself quite well to what is needed to support the plot.Three things in this movie really make it stand out.The first is the plot.  There seems to be a hidden meaning to every scene, and to almost every scene a twist that brings us into a totally different spot.  It's like a wild roller coaster ride in the dark.The second is the robberies.  It is amazing to watch the high tech devices in the hands of experts used to waltz through some of the most intricate security systems.  There are some minor slips in the robberies technically speaking, but nothing that destroys the film or even the robberies.The third element is the chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Connery is extremely intriguing especially because of the age difference.  And who's to say that normal people don't do strange things like that all the time?I'm tacking a fourth on here: In my opinion this film is the best work either Connery or Zeta-Jones has ever done.Also if you are looking for a similar movie with real style.  Thomas Crown Affair appears to be essentially it's counter part.  The only real difference is I think Thomas Crown Affair over did every aspect of itself.
$SUMMARY.: Didn't see that coming!!!

$REVIEW.: This is a fictionalized account of the all-black 92nd Infantry Division fighting in Italy in 1944

More specifically, it is the story of 4 black soldiers separated from their unit who come into contact with a young Italian boy and a family of Italian peasants


One of the soldiers particularly takes a liking to the traumatized boy-and his imaginary friend-and sort of "adopts" the boy as his own
In turn, the boy calls his new friend his "chocolate giant." The story is very Christian and religion is a major factor in bringing together these people from two completely different worlds


The brutal racism of the era is also well depicted and there seems to be sort of an epiphany on the part of the black soldiers when they come into contact with these "white folks" who do not treat them like animals.I'm not a huge fan of Spike Lee, but I do think he is a talented filmmaker who has made some quality films
Thus, I was disappointed with what I would regard as a somewhat amateurish production


The story was moving and had a lot of potential, but I think Lee blew it here

The battle sequences were awkward, the dialogue was often weak and inane, and too many of the characters were exaggerated to the point of near caricatures
I think this was a very important story that needed to be told, I just wish it would have been done a little better

All in all, it is worth checking out if the subject interests you, but I wouldn't expect to be blown away.



$SUMMARY.: Moving story, mediocre execution

$review_text.: "Source Code" is excellent! This is how the story goes: When decorated soldier Captain Colter Stevens wakes up in the body of an unknown man, he discovers he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train. In an assignment unlike any he's ever known, he learns he's part of a government experiment called the "Source Code," a program that enables him to cross over into another man's identity in the last 8 minutes of his life. With a second, much larger target threatening to kill millions in downtown Chicago, Colter re-lives the incident over and over again, gathering clues each time, until he can solve the mystery of who is behind the bombs and prevent the next attack.The cast led by Jake Gyllenhaal (as Colter Stevens), Michelle Monaghan (as Christina Warren), Vera Farmiga (as Collen Goodwin) & Jeffrey Wright (as Dr. Rutledge) is excellent. The directing by Duncan Jones (who also directed and wrote the story to "Moon" (2009) is excellent. The story & screenplay by Ben Ripley is excellent.The music by Chris Bacon (who also did the music to "Gnomeo & Juliet" (2011) is excellent. The cinematography by Don Burgess (who also did the cinematography, recently to "The Book Of Eli" (2010), the upcoming "Priest" (2011) & "The Muppets" (2011) is excellent.

The set decoration by Suzanne Cloutier (who also did the set decoration to "Taking Lives" (2004), "The Greatest Game Ever Played", "Lucky Number Slevin", "Get Smart" (2008) & "Punisher: War Zone" (2008) is excellent.

Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance. This is an excellent follow-up movie for Duncan Jones after "Moon". This is one of the best action movies of the year and one of the best movies of the year, thus far.

$REVIEW.: Everyone thinks that this is a Tim Burton film but he did not direct it
 The film is based on poem that Burton wrote and he produced the film.This film takes place where every holiday has a "Land"

Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon / Danny Elfman) is the king of Halloween Land
 Another brilliant Halloween is over and Jack is bored with Halloween
 Jack wanders the forest and finds the entrance to the other "Towns"

 He is drawn to the bright and shiny door of Christmas Town

 He is sucked into the portal and what he sees amazes him
 He is dazzled by the Christmas lights and snow

 And Jack decides to take over Christmas.Christmas Eve arrives and Jack takes over for Santa and delivers the presents made by Halloween Town
 Unfortunately, they are more appropriate for Halloween than Christmas.Sally (Catherine O'Hara) is the servant to the evil scientist (William Hickey) but she has a fascination with Jack
 When Oogie Boogie (Ken Paige) decides to take over Halloween Town, Sally comes to Jack's rescue.In the end everything works out.The story is well thought out and the dialogue is witty


 The production design and character design are outstanding
 They create the atmosphere of the movie


 Add to this a brilliant score by Danny Elfman

$REVIEW.: BFI is giving Criterion a run for their money.  These All Region Blu Ray's (I've also bought Jerzy Skolimowski's Deep End from them) are perfect: sound, picture, special features, packaging.  Just amazing!  This Blu Ray contains L'Age D'Or in Hi Def, as well as Un Chien Andalou, which is playable with two separate soundtracks:*Bunuel's definitive soundtrack, which he added himself back in 1960, comprised of excerpts from Wagner's Liebestod and Tristan und Isolde and a tango piece.*And a newly recorded score from Mordant Music, which give the short a very different feel.I was a bit skeptical about getting old black and whites on Blu Ray, mostly because the prints are so damaged by nature that it seems like a waste of extra pixels.  But these prints are as pristine as humanly possible given the source material, you can see the light from the projector glowing through the white letters of the opening titles.I've seen both of these films projected on the big screen, this Blu Ray version is better.  I would say, this is the only way to ever see either of these films.

$REVIEW.: I was very pleased with this film it was amazingly done and I would recommend to everyone.The horrifying true story of the Crowe family whose 12-year-old daughter, Stephanie, is brutally stabled while asleep in her own bedroom. As the family struggled to dissect the painful evidence of their daughter's death, the police pinpoint their prime suspect - her brother, Michael. Every tactic at the police's disposal is used to manipulate and bully Michael into confessing to the gruesome crime. But, is he truly responsible for her vicious death? The Interrogation of Michael Crowe stars Ally SheedyAn original movie for Court TV, THE INTERROGATION OF MICHAEL CROWE is based on the horrifyingly true story of the Californian Crowe family's double-victimization. When 12-year-old Stephanie is stabbed in her sleep, the police working on the investigation turn to the closest suspect: her 14-year-old brother, Michael. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the policemen are doing whatever they can to cajole a confession from the boy, convinced of his guilt by such peripheral evidence as his interest in Dungeons & Dragons. Starring Ally Sheedy (THE BREAKFAST CLUB, HIGH ART) as mom Cheryl Crowe, this tragic tale of injustice sheds light on some of the faults and holes inherent in the judicial system, among which human infallibility takes its place.

$review_text.: The latest entry in Soderbergh's non-Ocean's Xrepertoire is slight but effective.  Set in late 2008, it contains references to the subprime credit collapse and presidential election that render it almost instantly dated, but that is clearly on purpose.The Girlfriend Experienceis ephemeral by design.The movie is cut even more out of sequence thanThe Limey, so the story's main conflict takes on extra weight as we're forced to puzzle it together.  Kudos to Soderbergh for making a movie about prostitution that's not the least bit sensationalistic.  Though one of the film's core concerns is the way working as an escort can make it difficult to have a regular relationship, this arises organically from the particular characters, without a hint of moralism.  In fact there's almost no sex in the movie, just a lot of talk about money, which feels right and is a deeper taboo anyway.Given the lack of any explicit scenes, the casting of porn star Sasha Grey seems like a bit of a stunt.  Plenty of actresses could have handled the brief nudity, and plenty more could have delivered their lines with feeling.  Maybe she's giving a brilliant fake-naive performance, but it sure seems like Sasha Grey can't act.  Even this is not a problem, however, because everyone else in the movie can, so she comes off as stiff and distant which suits the character.The disc contains an alternate cut of the movie.  Nothing profoundly different--just a slightly different choice of out-of-sequence edits, but for my money it's tighter than the theatrical release so I'm glad it got to see the light of day.

I cannot stress this enough notice I use capital letters in the title also.This show like many shows nowadays on Showtime and HBO and AMC arE just plain incredible and should be watched from the very beginning. Now I 1st watched Dexter 2 years ago and I watched the 1st episode of season 5 with my parents now longtime Dexter fans will know that that was a huge gigantic mistake. (That's the season after the Trinity killer) OMG was that a huge mistake so dumb, so dumb.That's all it really have to say as my warning the show is great almost every season but my order of seasons that I love the best are in this order - season 2, season 1, season 4, season 6, season 3, season 5... and I'm really stoked for season 7 it's going to be great!So few have watched this do yourself a favor and follow love with Dexter he is so great.PS this show isn't really that scary like pop out and make you jump but it does have some Gore but you get used to that after a while.

$REVIEW.: I heard so many glowing reviews about this. So many of my friends kept gushing about it, tossing about words such as "inspired," "visionary," and the like. So, I decided I had to see what they were talking about.Unfortunately, I came to a conclusion very early on in my viewing, one that didn't change through the rest of the episodes. Other than the Holy Trinity of Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns, from which I can quote most of the dialogue and feel compelled to watch whenever I run across them on TV -- I don't like Westerns. I don't hate them but at best I'm just indifferent to them; they bore me.Being as objective as possible, I think Joss had an awesome idea. Sure, _Star Wars_ was the original Western in space, but Firefly didn't try to disguise it under a thick layer of pure sci-fi, it *was* a Western. It just happened to have spaceships and other planets. It's brilliant, really, and on the right network it should've run for a good five seasons. The acting was good, the plots were good and it had a loyal audience. FOX sucks as a network, that was the problem.But even if it'd had a seven to ten year run, I wouldn't have been one of the regular viewers. The only episodes I truly enjoyed were the ones that took place solely within Serenity or within space itself, where it became straight sci-fi with little to no western in sight. Once they hit planetside, my interest waned and I started looking at the clock on my DVD player, counting down the minutes until it was over.The theme song was pretty bad, too. Yeah, the words were good, but the tune sucked and so did the singing. But, then again, I think country music sucks as a whole, so I'm probably biased.This really wasn't the series for me, unfortunately, but that wouldn't stop me from recommending it to people who like westerns, which I've done many times since. This may not be a show I personally enjoyed, but I do think it was a good one and it shouldn't have ended when it did.

$REVIEW.: The movie is so sugary sweet  that one really needs a shower and an insulin shot. The Sherman Brothers are almost as shameful as Andrew Lloyd Weber when they play that incredibly annoying title song over and over  and over again. As if we didn't hear it  the first  seven times. It is one of the annoying tunes you can't get out of your head. Please make them stop.I'm a musical lover.  I saw the movie when I was 12 and thought it was pure  nonsense.  I remember everyone in school  called it Pretty Sh-tty Bang Bang.  So thirty years later  is my reaction the same?Yea!  It's way too long and much ado about nothing. It takes 14 minutes for the opening credits to give us the back history of the car which really has no bearing on the story whatsoever. Hadn't the producer or director heard of editing??  This is what killed the film musical.Dick Van Dyke is a ne'er do well inventor with two kids. Sally Anne Howes almost runs the kids over and come to talk to Dick Van Dyke.  Van Dyke rescues a car his kids love that is scheduled for the junk heap. He rebuilds it and they all go for a ride in it.  Van Dyke tells  a fantasy story  about Nasty Bulgarians wanting the car he has reconditioned. The fantasy story lasts two hours.  Boy did they take a wrong turn.The fantasy story is not as interesting as the original story of the romance between Sally ann Howes and Dick Van Dyke and this fantasy story takes up about two hours  of the three hour movie. About one hour and 45 minutes of the fantasy needed to be cut. But I guess they thought it was cute. I'm sure they also thought the title song was cute. I'm sure they thought those cute kids could sing.Sally Ann Howes has a perfectly annoying name--Truly Scrumptious. And those kids who can't sing (didn't anyone notice this?)  croon the "Truly Scrumptious" song to her. It made this twelve year old roll his eyes. The adult me had the same reaction.  Please make those kids  stop singing that awful song. It's enought to make one stop loving musicals.Okay Dick Van Dyke is likeable enough but not as effective as in Mary Poppins.  He shines with the song "The Old Bamboo" ( the best number) and his caring for the kids.  Alas, he's railroaded by the insipid story and material. Someone also told him not to use an English accent although his kids and father have one.Sally Ann  Howes is charming enough and perfectly cast in a part that Julie Andrews (the wise)  probably turned down.  She is railroaded by the material especially  that awful ballad "Lonely Man"  sung in an operatic style  that can not be appreciated by Musical theatre buffs, opera buffs  nor kids. Please make her stop singing it . Please make her stop twirling her skirt and running through the countryside. It isn't cute.I chuckled out loud at Lionel Jeffries'  travelling  song "Posh" which he sings  suspended in his cabin from a zeppelin while kidnapped.  An absolute highlight.  There is also some over the top annoying buffonery from Gert Frobe, Anna Quayle, Benny Hill  and the two kidnap men.The magical Dee dee Wood and Mark Breaux who wonderfully choreographed Mary Poppins and Sound of Music  ( and recreated Michael Kidds  Lil Abner) are apparently at a loss here as there work is almost entirely hack. The Sherman Brothers really needed to rewrite songs instead of the awful  mish mash they have assembled here.A spoonful of rewrites could have made the score go down!Put that in your candy bar!There is too much bad candy here and not enough substance. It isn't truly scrumpttious. It isn't Toots Sweet. It isn't cute. Run for your insulin.

Suspenseful. Proves that humans act, react, think and make decisions more often with their limbic brains than their frontal lobes. On the other hand, we can and often do the right thing in the end.

$REVIEW.: "A Few Good Men", directed by Rob Reiner and based on the screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, should easily make anyone's list of the top 50 films ever made.  However, the film does take certain liberties in its portrayal of Marine culture and military justice.  As a civilian myself, I am certainly not an authority on the subject.  However, it doesn't take Einstein to figure out that no Judge Advocates General attorney speaks to their superiors the way Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) does and gets away with it.  While I realize that Cruise aimed for a comic approach to his "boy entering manhood" trademark role, I was disappointed to see the rest of the cast seeming to play along with his irreverence.Nevertheless, his cavalier attitude towards authority figures sets up a few stellar rebukes from his costars, notably Lt. Com. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) and of course, the crowd favorite Lt. Col. Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson).  While Cruise probably had the best perfomance of his career (along with a strong supporting cast in Moore, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon, J.T. Walsh, and Keifer Sutherland), Nicholson steals the show.  His "you can't handle the truth!" monologue alone is worth the price of admission.The cinematography of this film is absolutely mind blowing, except for one matte shot of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba that looks very fake.  The Windward Division barracks reminds me of a base I saw in Key West, Florida.  The courtroom is shown from all angles, almost like being there yourself, and you feel a real sense of history in the place.  Pay attention to the lighting.  Reiner mentions the lighting in his director commentary, and yes, it does make a difference in how you experience the film.The widescreen special edition of "A Few Good Men" has the obligatory extras.  Reiner is not very talkative in the director commentary, which is disappointing.  However, there are a few bonuses, such as a special documentary made for the DVD, production notes, spoken language selections for French, Portuguese, Spanish, and plenty of chapter selections (for those who prefer to skip to their favorite parts).All in all, a great movie.  I give it three stars for factual accuracy, four stars for cinematography and musical score, and five stars for the over the top peformances of Nicholson, Cruise, and Moore.  These average out to the four star rating.  Buy it, forget about the flaws, and enjoy the performances of an A-list cast.
$SUMMARY.: One good reason to watch this film: Nicholson!

$REVIEW.: Here's the TV-movie version of the Buford Pusser story.  Although it is not nearly as gripping as the theatrical film "Walking Tall" (starring Joe Don Baker), it is definitely a cut above the awful sequels with Bo Svenson.  Brian Dennehy, as usual, delivers a solid performance, and his fans will enjoy it.  It's not a great film, but not bad, either.  It's definitely worth a look, just for Dennehy's performance.

$review_text.: Prometheus does really well as the prequel for Alien.  It spins a good yarn as they say but when you compare the special effects between the three movies you can see such a big difference it's almost painful.  My one big question is - WHY???? They never do explain that. What did we do? It also shows things like how the medical beds/capsules are more advanced in the past than they were in Alien/Aliens so yeah, some of the stuff really sticks out like that. That advanced medical bed would have helped Ripley out.Another big discrepancy are holograms in Prometheus where as I remember the scene in Aliens where they had the big screen looking for the colonists in the table looking for them in the sublevels, this was the movie made how many years later too!  Some of the alien eggs are different too.  As a matter of fact so much of the movie is different I need to get the book so I can better understand everything what was going on.  The ending was a bit trite and would anyone in their right mind do that after what he did?  I guess she didn't know what he did to her guy but eventually she'll find out.  One thing that was a high point of the movie is how they showed the "giant" chamber from Alien where they showed the giant on the "couch" with his chest blown out from an Alien. They show a scene where Hal? the android activates the Giants' system...that scene was way cool and how they accomplished that WOW!  I would definitely recommend this movie.

$review_text.: Amanda Root plays Anne Elliot wonderfully, though I think Ciaran Hinds was a bit over the top in his portrayal of Wentworth. I don't think Jane Austen had such a forceful Wentworth in mind when she wrote Persuasion.  All the  same, the BBC has come fairly close to rendering as faithful a rendition of  the book as can be done in a 2 hour film. They do a lovely job of bringing  a sad, worn woman back to youthful bloom as she is more in the sphere of  her old love. The actors who played Anne's sisters were terrific, but her  father wasn't near the &quot;fop&quot; in the book as portrayed in the  movie. The story is a terrific one, about love lost and re-won, and what  can befall you if you do not trust your own judgment even when it is  superior to those around you.  This is one of Jane's rare novels where she  takes you to different areas of England...from the countryside to Bath, to  Lyme Regis. It makes for lovely photography and creates visual interest.  This is one of those movies you'll be drawn to watch again and again.

$review_text.: There are some really artful moments captured by Braff, whilst Andrew's friends seek to null themselves in drugs he inversely begins to wake from such a state.The story goes on to resolve a number of important issues for Andrew, during which, Braff makes it clear that everyone around him suffers a similar fate. Everyone around him deals with issues of their own. In hindsight, its a simple story blown up to chaotic proportions, but I guess that is the story of many people from a higher socioeconomic background. It deals with suffering of the western man. Baff makes contrast of this with the "african brother" who's life struggles and accomplishments could put all of them to shame. Its a realization that goes begging... to each is their own I guess, for a state of depression is a curse just as awful as any other misfortune. Anyone who has suffered from it, can tell you this.There are many concepts to be drawn from this movie, which I found quite intruiging. However, I wish Andrew's life had not involved a tragic childhood experience and strong medicated drugs (Lithium), because often there doesn't have to be apparent excuses for such an incapacitated state. I feel that somewhat undermines the message of this movie.On top of that, it plays stage to one hell of a soundtrack with some of my favourites, such as 'the shins'. I would have never thought I'd see their "new slang" track on a hollywood movie back in 2001. Finally some indie rock getting the attention it deserves. Cleverly hand picked and incoporated by Braff. Respect!

$REVIEW.: Remember, like, in elementary school when someone farted?  And it was really funny?  Do you also think it's hilarious when someone gets hurt, like getting bonked on the head?  Over and over?  Well, then, you'll appreciate this movie.  Otherwise, you might be out of luck.  "Superhero Movie" is much better than the earlier "movie" parodies by the same people, but unfortunately, not that much better.  Drake Bell is appealing as the Peter Parker-type teen who gets bit by a dragonfly and develops superpowers.  Other cast members, including Leslie Nielson and Sara Paxton as the love interest (mugging like Kirsten Dunst) do a good job, too, but they can't make such a lame script funny.  Unless of course, you find flatulence really funny.  There's lots of farting in this movie.  And a few small clever bits, but they are few and far between.  These movies are like the Y2K equivalent of Tom Green movies, you can't figure out why they keep getting made.  Oh well, maybe they appeal to somebody.

$REVIEW.: Young Lucy Pevenise, along with her older brothers Edmund and Peter, and her older sister, Susan, are in London during the initial bombing raids of WW II. And like many families of the time, the parents decide to send them to the country for safer keeping. Peter, the oldest, is told by their mother to "watch over them" and make sure they stay safe. And although this seems like a fairly simple request, Peter's ability to protect his siblings will be put to the ultimate test. But not by WW II, but by an amazing secret discovered by young Lucy.Soon after being spirited into the company of a hermit-like professor's care (Jim Broadbent), they decide to play hide-and-seek, and it's during this game which Lucy discovers a mysterious wardrobe. She tucks herself inside and backs to the rear of the cabinet ...only to discover herself in an entirely different world. Here she meets up with Mr. Tumnus, a strange half-stag, half-human creature who explains much about the wintry landscape Lucy now finds herself in. The place is called Narnia, and it's been locked in winter for over 100 years by someone known as "The White Witch" (who claims to be the Queen of Narnia).Lucy, excited beyond words, rushes back to "the real world" to tell her brothers and sister about what she's discovered and, of course, they don't believe her ...until they all get into the wardrobe one day and find out she's been telling the truth.Soon a prophecy is revealed to the two brothers and two sisters: it is said that when Aslan returns, two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam will come back and reclaim the four thrones of Narnia. But first they have to battle The White Witch, struggle with the internal dynamics of sibling rivalries, and face the death of the very creature who helped create this strange world.______________________________________________________________________________Comparisons abound between NARNIA and THE LORD OF THE RINGS. And why not. Both are fantasy tales. Both authors (Lewis and Tolkien) were friends during the same era. And both stories have recently made it to the silver screen. And although my heart still rests with THE LORD OF THE RINGS, NARNIA deserves much praise.But this praise doesn't necessarily come from me...I went to the theater today (a weekend) and it was packed with children (ranging in age from their teens to five years old), and while watching it I noticed something intriguing: not a single interruption occurred during the entire 140 minutes. No crying child asking to go home; no temper tantrums; no shushing of mothers and fathers to their kids. I think this speaks pretty highly of how engaged this film kept its intended audience. I will say that when Aslan became "injured" there were gasps of dismay from a couple of kids behind me and they quietly asked their mother if "Aslan was going to be okay" (I have to admit, that was pretty cute).Georgie Henley (Lucy) was exquisite as one of the prime characters (move over Dakota Fanning). Her acting was spot-on and brought a lump to my throat several times. Liam Neeson's Aslan voice was also perfect with its deep resonance that seemed to echo through the theater (must've been a good sound recording). Tilda Swinton was also excellent as the sinister White Witch who rules Narnia with a cold, iron fist. And James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus was also pulled off very well.There've been several reviews (professional) that have been critical of the film's Christian-based theological leanings. Well ...yes. That's true. It does have that, but so did C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles novels. So did this bother me? Not at all. I don't prescribe to any particular faith, and if you go into NARNIA with an anti-religious chip on your shoulder, I'm sure you could rip the film apart. But if you go into the theater strictly to enjoy good storytelling and for entertainment, you'll probably delight in NARNIA just as much as the ten-year-old who sat behind me quietly throughout the entire movie.

$review_text.: I'll be the first to admit that GoodTimes has produced some, shall we say, &quot;less-than-perfect&quot; features over the years, but they have done very well here
 This tale was obviously made by people who have a great deal of love and respect for the 1964 classic original
 They have worked very hard to use computer animation to come as close as possible to the look of the old stop-motion animation, and I think they have succeeded


 The characters' movements are a bit smoother than the original, but that is about the only difference.Returning from the '60s are Rudolph, the reindeer of the famous shiny nose, his dentist/elf buddy Hermie, the whacked-out miner Yukon Cornelius, the Abominable Snow Monster (will he ever learn to swim?), Rudolph's girlfriend Clarice, all of the minor characters, and of course, Santa Claus


 They have come together to investigate the mysterious Toy Taker, who has managed to succesfully pirate all the world's toys, including Santa's workshop itself

 The new actors provided to give voice to the classic characters all sound perfect

 Richard Dreyfuss does well in a role as the obligatory snowman narrarator (though I do miss Burl Ives), and Jamie Lee Curtis puts in an appearance as the Hippo Queen

 Rick Moranis provides the voice of the Toy Taker himself.Like many others out there, I grew up watching the original stop-motion Rudolph every year


 I was a little worried that this wouldn't be any good, especially when I saw the GoodTimes label on it


 But, my kids LOVE it!  And, it was produced for them, after all


 This movie makes absolutely NO pretense whatsoever that it was designed and produced for anyone but preschoolers, and it certainly succeeded with mine.As adults, we see the world with different perspectives than we did as little kids

 Nothing, no matter how well done, will ever recapture the joys of the specials we saw for the first time as little kids back when you only had a chance to watch these shows once or twice a year
 Especially since now you can buy them on DVD or VHS and watch them over and over, any time you want


 Anything is more special when you are a kid and it is only availble to watch once a year.The animation is not the most top-notch out there, but then, it's not supposed to be


 It's more concerned with looking like the original, with all its flaws due to 60's technology


 And yes, the plot is not the most original in the world


 Any parent will figure out the identity and motives of the Toy Taker before the movie is half over
 But the kids will love it, and really, isn't that what it's all about??

$review_text.: is sort of a sequel to White Zombie. The director is the same for both movies and he reuses Bela Lugosi's eyes to show when the zombies are under control. The eyes float over the image of who is being controlled.That's where the similarities end. This story begins in World War I. An Asian priest offers them a secret formula to turn men into zombies, who would be the perfect soldiers. After a demonstration, the Allies decide this is too horrible and imprison the priest for life to prevent him from using it. The French representative decides he wants the formula, so he sneaks into the prison, kills the priest, and takes the partially burned cloth showing where the formula can be found in Cambodia.After the war ends, a group of Allies (including the French bad guy) heads to Cambodia to find and destroy the formula. One fellow brings his daughter who instantly sets up a love triangle. Most of the film is focused on this triangle. One of the guys discovers the formula before everyone else and uses it to get the girl.I found the film a bit disappointing. The atmosphere was all over the place (sometime it was light drama, sometimes it was a romantic drama, sometimes it was eerie, but hardly enough for a movie about zombies) and the zombies are basically hypnotized living people and not very scary. The story meanders around and a lot of stuff seems just thrown in to make the movie longer (like the native Cambodian woman dancing for the group).The video transfer is not too great and the audio was very muffled, which seems typical for less famous movies from that era.

$review_text.: I like this movie - A LOT. In particular, I like the pace of the film and the interplay between the Hackman and Baryshnikov characters. Also, the "confetti" jacket that G&eacute;raldine Danon wears when she meets Hackman at the restaurant deserves a look-see on its own. Finally, I was in the military on active duty stationed in Heidelberg, Germany during the time the movie was being filmed. Between 1990 and 1993, I also visited Berlin (both the former East and West), Paris (Le Tour Eiffel - but of course!), and flew in and out of BWI airport frequently. Every time I see this film I am transported back in time to those locations to recall exactly how they appeared back when. When this movie is on the air, I can't look away.

$review_text.: You couldn't find a bigger fan of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd going into the Christmas holiday of 1981...and then they released NEIGHBORS.At least with Spielberg's 1979 bomb, "1941", there was enough special effects and mayhem to keep the audience distracted from what a vapid stinkbomb that movie really added up to.When NEIGHBORS came out, everyone knew it stank after the first screening

 Siskel and Ebert's thumbs didn't know what to do

 All the elements were there
 How could this miss?If you read Bob Woodward's excellent book about Belushi's final days, "Wired", there was no hope WHILE THEY WERE FILMING IT


 The producers fumbled when they chose ROCKY director John Avlidsen to direct (their logic was that they could hit comedy gold by hiring a humorless, serious director--say, like a Stanley Kubrick--and letting him direct a dark comic screenplay--like DR


STRANGELOVE, for instance).Wrong

 Wrong, wrong, wrong

 Belushi wanted to kill the director just days into shooting, publicly announcing that Avlidsen knew nothing about humor or comic timing

 Switching Aykroyd & Belushi to play against type was a bold move but this movie just flogs along, never finding itself and definitely blowing any chance for a funny scene.It's too bad


 The movie sank like a stone in Christmas of '81

 On March 5th, 1982, John Belushi died on Sunset Boulevard, a sqaulid death and a Hollywood tragedy because he never got the chance to prove himself after NEIGHBORS
 Sad.At least we'll always have "Saturday Night Live" (which is being released by each season, thankfully) and NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE.

$review_text.: I loved it

All the actors were fantastic, with Mary-Louise Parker being so entertaining that even with such top box office draw as Willis, Freeman, Mirren & Malkovitch I enjoyed her scenes the most

She was just so genuine - be it really irritated or really entertained

Fantastic job.The story has a few unique twists and turns that keep the plot moving and interesting
Lots of action (which Bruce Willis is spectacular at IMO) and plenty of humor with some drama mixed in for good measure


Malkovitch plays an excellent nut job, and Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren are outstanding as always


I have to say - I prefer Karl Urban as a good guy but he does a good job as an agent doing his job even while you don't like him very much for it
I like him more as Bones in Star Trek but not because he isn't good here - he is
Just a personal preference.All in all a film I will watch and enjoy repeatedly.

$review_text.: I was surprised that overall vote gave Constantine only two and a half stars which I think this movie does not deserve, because it's worthy of more.Keanu Reeves, who plays the main role in the movie, is fit well for the role of Constantine, and plays very profesionally.The whole idea of the movie, is is based on the thought of angels and daemons, the God and the Devil. Constantine appears in this movie to be the one sending the deamons back to hell, therefore repaying all his sins with God, so that he can go to Heaven in his afterlife.He helps a girl find out the truth behind her sister's supposed sucide, which everyone but her believes that she comitted.The special effects in the movie, which are included in scenes where Constatine confronts these half-bloods are very good. The camera work in the movie is done very well.The plot of "Constantine" has lots of mystery and dark themes. If you wish to omit that, than this movie is not for you. However, if you support the idea and the religious beliefs of the director, I would recommend this movie to you.Thanks,mirage

$REVIEW.: This is one of those iconic films that is often referred to
 See it for that reason

 It isn't very well done
 The plot is thin, implausible (even for 1973), and predictable


 The acting is weak


 The rampant sexism and exploitation woven into the story is gratuitous for the main plot, but evidently serves as a way for the film to exploit sexuality
 Still, it has become something of a classic.

$review_text.: "Just you wait a little while,The nasty man in black will come,With his little chopper,He will chop you up!"It is interesting to see that the original iconic image for Fritz Lang's "M" was the letter written on the palm of a hand, which is what you see on the cover of the VHS edition.  Today the most famous short is what appears on the cover of the Criterion DVD edition, with Hanz Beckert (Peter Lorre) seeing his reflecting and finding the "M" imprinted on the back of his coat.  Certainly the latter image is the most memorable, but the former really does represent the film better.  Until the final scenes of the film at his "trial" where he gives his memorable speech, Beckert (Franz Becker in some translations) is more shadow than substance.  What stands out is the idea that the criminal underground would band together in an all-out effort to apprehend the child murderer, and would succeed where the legal authorities would not.  Even in Nazi Germany on the eve of the Hoolcaust, murdering children is beyond the pale for criminals.The opening scene of the film is the best part from a cinematic standpoint, as a increasingly worried Madame Beckmann (Ellen Widmann), waits for her daughter Elsie (Inge Landgut) to come home from school.  In the montage we see Elsie walking along the street bouncing a ball and then tossing it up against a light post.  The camera pans up to the bulletin asking, "Who is the murderer?" and then a shadow falls over it.  Whatever doubts we have are gone, for we know that poor little Elsie is doomed.  The strange little man in the black suit admires the ball and buys the little girl a balloon while her mother becomes more anxious at home.  Finally there are the shots an empty place setting at a table, of a ball rolling along the ground, and a balloon caught in electric wires before flying away.With the public's angry reaction to the death of yet another young girl, the police increase their efforts, raiding a bar to see what they can find.  While the police are trying to figure out what to do next so are the leaders of the underworld.  The break comes when the blind man who sells the balloons recognizes the tune the killer whistled the day he bought a balloon for Elsie.  Beckert has the habit of whistling "In the Hall of the Mountain King" from Edvard Grieg's "Peter Gynt" suite (the whistling was dubbed by Lang himself).  Beckert is followed as he stalks his next victim and the tell-tale "M" is placed upon the back of his coat.  Trapped in an office building, Beckert is captured by the criminals and then placed on trial for his crimes.Tried before a court of underworld criminals, a terrified and bug-eyed Beckert tries to proclaim his innocence at first, but then suddenly confesses in an emotional outburst, screaming, "I can't help myself!"  In time Lorre's performances would be reduced to caricature, easily imitated by even the most inept of impressionists, but here it is raw and powerful.  When he is confronted with the photographs of the young girls that he has killed, he flinches as if receive physical blows, which only serves to underscore the psychological nature of this classic film.  Up until this point the film has been more about technique and it is not until the child murderer is finally in their hands that the criminals try to come to terms with what sort of monster they have captured.Ultimately I think that in "M" the efforts of the criminals are best compared not with those of the police, but with the mob mentality that attacks one suspect on the street.  Such a scene presages Lang's first American film, "Fury," but it also recalls the scene in Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" where the mob inflamed by Antony's funeral oration kills the poet Cinna for having the same name as one of the conspirators (and his bad verses).  Given what was happening in Germany in 1931, it is interesting to note that the violence of the streets, represented by Hitler's Brown Shirts, is personified not by the authorities but by the average men in the street.  I do not want to read too much into what Lang is trying to say about the Nazis in this film, but those who want to make a case for that perspective will find plenty to work with in "M."What we now have available is a fully restored version of this classic 1931 film, courtesy of the Munich Film Archive, which features a restored soundtrack, including Lang's originally intended long periods of silence (remember, this is Lang's first sound picture), and the frame size restored to its proper ratio.  What this means is that if you have not seen "M" in a long while the time has come for you to see it again.  "M" still succeeds today, even in black & white with subtitles, because Lang invokes both horror and pity for the murderer and his victims, and creates a compelling "modern" city in which these characters live.  Besides Lang and Lorre, the third person who deserves lots of credit is cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner, who also did F.W. Murnau's "Nosferatu" (although the stories and styles are decidedly different).  The rest is still a notch below the highest rank of films for that time, but it is still qualifies as "must see."

$review_text.: This is one of the most engrossing and entertaining series we've ever seen!  It truly makes Roman history come alive--with all of its splendor--but also its seamier side-- and the political intrigues of the main characters are fascinating.  The story is told from the standpoint of two Roman Centurion friends--who are caught up in the shifting currents of Roman politics, sometimes benefiting and sometimes victimized by these changes.  As their stories play out, you witness the Roman transition from Republic to Dictatorship--and all the tumult that ensues.  The acting, staging and story-lines are first class!  WARNING - There is graphic sex and violence--probably not suitable for children under 17/18.

$REVIEW.: When I purchased the ECW best of.... DVD's, I expected blood, guts, gore, and all that good stuff ECW was so well known for.  And this one delivers.....sort of.  First off, there is a lot of "wrestling" in this DVD.  The DVD starts off with a 4-corners match with a young Chris Jericho, 2 Cold Scorpio, Pitbull #2, and obviously one of the most famous wrestlers ever in ECW, Shane Douglas.  This is surprisingly good, but long and drawn out.  2 Cold Scorpio(...).  Jericho looks really good, but is out of the match early.  When all is said and done, Douglas and Pitbull #2 start a long, drawn out feud when Francine joins up with Douglas.  Overall, this is one of the better matches on the DVD.If like wrestling, there's a lot more of it on the DVD.  The final match in ECW for two hall of famers, Dean Malenko and Eddy Guererro is a 5 star match, with too many moves to count and more technical wrestling than ECW had in it's final 4 years.  Psychosis vs. Rey Misterio Jr. is so overrated...it's not even funny.  The match is typical lucha style, and to call it a "classic" is giving it more credit than it deserves.If it's hardcore wrestling you yearn for, like I do, this DVD delivers with a surprisingly good Stairway to Hell Match pitting Sabu vs. The Sandman, with lots of (...)spots.  Ian vs. Axl Rotten is dull, but there is quite a bit of blood.  And of course, Rob Van Dam's surprising win over Bam Bam Bigelow is played up to be one of the best matches ever....and it isn't.  But it is decent, with Van Dam doing some incredible acrobatics.Overall, this is a 4 star DVD, and the second best "best of" by ECW.  If you are a casual fan with respect for a good combination of wrestling and violence, you will be pleasantly surprised by Path of Destruction.

$review_text.: One of my absolute favourite movies of all time and my best movie of 2005. I still recall my enchantment watching it in the theatre. Hands down, my best cinematic experience so far.It is a visual delight, an edge of your seat thriller, a love story of every sort and a laugh out loud comedy all rolled into one marvellous package.Peter Jackson is a genius. Spielberg is sooo yesterday. Peter Jackson is the new Steven Spielberg.Before King Kong, Naomi Watts was one of those actresses I see a thousand times and never remember. In Kong, she shines like a true star. She is beautiful physically and in her spirit and actively so.My favourite character however, just has to be the demented Carl Denham played to perfection by Jack Black who is no stranger to such roles but here, he takes it a notch further and it is a riot to watch his movie making passion degenerate into exploitative, desperate madness.Adrien Brody does an expected and usual fine job of being the noble, quiet and brave hero. I like him a lot but he does nothing new here.After watching it in theatres, I have seen this movie at least four or so times on dvd and each time is like the first time. Kong is a wonder. He is a hero and I love watching his love for Ann Darrow develop and blossom. His protectiveness is so endearing and the scene where Ann Darrow seeks his protection from the dinosaurs and Kong goes into alpha male mode shredding the dinosaurs to pieces is one of the highlights of the movie.On dvd however, I haven't been able to re-watch the scene where Kong gets killed. I just cant bear it and I hurt with Ann Darrow.I am very impressed by how tactfully and tastefully the relationship between Anna and Kong is treated. In our sex-drenched culture it could have easily degenerated into something perverse but it is instead sweet and affectionate.Any movie starring the very talented Jamie Bell is always worth my while even though he got nothing more than a bit part.I will be watching this dvd many more times and so should you.

THE BEST OF WRESTLEMANIA 1-15 is without a doubt the greatest wrestling disc so far this gives you highlights, matches, and storyline creations on the "biggest spectacle in sports entertainment." with that said i have one imperative to say:BUY THE "WWF WRESTLEMANIA 2000" DVD NOW!!!!

$REVIEW.: Unfortunately for &quot;American Psycho,&quot; the book has already garnered such a notoriously controversial stature that the film itself has a difficult task in trying to win over viewers. Like &quot;Natural Born Killers,&quot; many people may have already made up their minds about this movie long before they even consider watching it.Like &quot;The Fight Club, &quot;American Psycho&quot; is a movie that could not be more misunderstood. Sure, this is about a psychopath on the most childishly obvious of all levels, but most of all this is satire on the yuppies of the mid to late 80's. It is an exploration in the hollow, meaningless existence of a rich Wall Street stock broker. A man who's life is so consumed by greed and power lunches that he can only find salvation whilst murdering someone. All the best scenes of &quot;American Psycho&quot; occur in the first three quarters of an hour. Christian Bale meticulously describes his morning routine with hilarious results and constantly tries to explain the significance of 1980's pop music. &quot;The Greatest Love of All's transcendant beauty makes it by far Whitney Houston's most accomplished record&quot; he claims, before butchering two girls. There is also a perfect scene in which Bale and his peers spend ten minutes arguing over who's business card font is better.The violence (and sex) may be unsettling to some but is often times hilarious if you are willing to take it with a grain of salt. How can you not laugh when a bank machine asks Bale to &quot;feed me a stray cat?&quot;This is a very clever and sophisticated film that could be perceived incorrectly. It is one of 2000's finer movies and deserves something better than to be overlooked because of the book's notoriety.

I say that with John Cassavetes starring, directing several episodes, and having a lot of production input about the show, that it is more than just another 1950's private detective program.  You get the whole series (only 1 season BUT these were the days when TV seasons lasted practically all year round) for a very reasonable price.  Any fan of Cassavetes' acting talents should get more than their money's worth.  He was never a light-weight --- not even when he was this young.

$REVIEW.: Tom Hanks takes the helm in this intense recreation of a Somalian pirate raid-turned-kidnapping on the open seas
Although it's most intently focused on the high-stress elements of the experience, which admittedly make for some gripping, powerful footage, I was most impressed with how even-handedly the film treated the Somali interlopers


While making no excuses for their actions, it successfully conveys an understanding of the pressures and motivations that would drive someone to attempt such a brazen assault and, ultimately, lends sympathy to their plight


Hanks is, predictably, excellent throughout as the stern-for-a-reason captain, though his New England accent seems to drift away with the tide as events unfold


His emotional breakdown near the end of the ordeal is particularly memorable and stirring


Although the plot doesn't cover a lot of ground, Captain Phillips is nonetheless effective at ratcheting up the drama and delivering a charged, uncomfortable, claustrophobic atmosphere.

$review_text.: Arnold Schwarzenegger makes his break-through debut as one of the greatest fantasy heroes of all-time: CONAN THE BARBARIAN! A young boy is stripped from his homeland after a vicious warlord destroys his entire clan. Conan is forced into slavery and then trained to fight for his keep, but upon his release, he uses his new found strength and skill to track down the evil Thulsa Doom in his quest for revenge! The exotic locations and decorative set designs for CONAN exist far beyond the realm of our world, which allows director John Milius to transport us to a magical land that is filled with swords, giant serpents, and sorcery. Schwarzenegger is iconic as the legendary Cimmerian warrior, embodying strength, courage, and honor as he battles his way through the armies of his enemy. The rich storytelling and memorable characters help to transform the film into a modern epic. A large debt of this is owed specifically to the great James Earl Jones and his performance as the god-king Thulsa Doom, who commands the screen with his power and charisma. CONAN continues to rule as one of the defining films of its genre now nearly thirty-years after its release.Conan the Barbarian returns to aid a young princess in a quest to fulfill her destiny, facing a number of perilous tasks and ruthless enemies along the way. In CONAN THE DESTROYER, our epic hero is reduced to a mere shell of his former self in a weak story that would have been better suited for the comic books. Schwarzenegger is fed a number of ridiculous lines that cross the line from comical to laughable. He is joined by a colorful band of warriors that fight alongside him, but the main thing that the sequel lacks is a strong central villain to serve as its focus. Without a Thulsa Doom for Conan to conquer, the plot wanders through various castles and dungeons with no real direction or purpose. Wilt Chamberlain, Grace Jones, and Olivia d'Abo deliver adequate performances, but the sense of camaraderie that existed in the previously film simply isn't there. Richard Fleischer does deliver a strong visual style and a number of impressive sets, two of the only characteristics that are carried over from the original. As sword-and-sorcery pictures go, CONAN THE DESTROYER has enough might and magic to please most genre fans, but the empty plotting leaves much to be desired.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies

$REVIEW.: I sat through this last night on network TV. Wish I could have that hour and a half back. This movie shouldn't really be called Western. It's more like a strange, dysfunctional parody that isn't funny. The dialogue is so trite that it distracts from good scraps of acting. The cast could and should have been impressive. Gene Hackman reprises his typecast role as the resident control freak. Sharon Stone is the absurdly beautiful victim seeking vengeance. The ending fizzles. If you enjoy graphic violence and not much else, this is the movie for you. If you would rather have characterization, plot and maybe even a life lesson, consider the other Quick And The Dead movie that stars Sam Elliott.

Albert is engaged to Rosie (who wants him to be an English teacher, not a scientist like in the 1963 film version.) This is true to the original Broadway version. There are a few new songs, but they work very well. Jason Alexander and Vanessa Williams are wonderful! What a surprise to see both act, sing and dance (and well at that.) The only flaw is the casting of Cynna Phillips as Kim (she is much too old for the part.)Overall,  skip the 1963 version and see this 'Birdie'. You'll be pleasantly surprised and much entertained.

$REVIEW.: When I first heard of The Expendables film back in 2009 I was excited, and what man who grew up in the 1980's and 1990's. Sylvester Stallone was making a hall of fame and all-star action film that brought together himself along with Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Jason Statham, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Gary Daniels to name a few. You had action stars from the 1980's, 1990's and 2000's all in the same film. It seemed like a good and fun idea and I thought it would be a great action film. I went to see it when it first came out and leaving the theater I was disappointed. It was at best an action film, and it suffered at The Avengers suffered from. It's a great concept to bring together larger than life action or superheroes, but once you get by the excitement of seeing all your favorite action stars or superheroes in the same film you begin to see the flaw that are plainly there to see. The Avengers had them, but nowhere near as bad as The Expendables. For that reason I when I heard that there was going to be a sequel I wasn't excited. I was interested and paid attention to the news about the film, but I wasn't going to pay ten dollars or more for what I thought was going to be an average action film at best, and after seeing The Expendables 2 recently I was right not to waste my money.The Expendables 2 is much worse than the original. In fact after I watched the film and gave it time the worse my opinion of the film grew. The Expendables overall plot is about them trying to stop a cache of plutonium which Jean Claude Van-Damn is after. Yes I'm not even going to use their character names, because they aren't any characters in this film. I mean who cares about this men whether they live or die, or if you can understand them. Take the first opening action scene I couldn't understand a word they anyone was saying except the curse words, and maybe that's all that they were saying which also led to about a fourth of dialogue to be completely unrecognizable. Next they brought characters in and out of the film for real no reason except to show off as many action stars as possible while being detrimental to the film. For example Jet Li is a great action star, but they got rid of him with in the first ten minutes and introduced us Liam Hemsworth who I believe played Billy a sniper. On a side note Liam really needs to ask his brother Chris for some help with roles. I know he'll get more time in the sequel, but he had like two lines in The Hunger Games and he's just a throw away character that Stallone and the director Simon West try to make us care about. I mean they introduce him he shows off his ability as a sniper, talks about leaving to be with his girlfriend even though they don't we have no connection to the character or care what happens to him, and then he's killed off about ten to fifteen minutes after Li disappears from the film. Oh yes I forgot in the beginning of the film Stallone and his team go rescue some billionaire and end rescuing Arnold Schwarzenegger who is there for some convenient reason to say some funny dialogue and then vanishes. I know I know defenders of this film will say the action films are generally ridiculous and over the top, but The Expendables 2 is laughably ridiculous only in bad way. Most and good action films have a coherent plot and the viewer actually comes to care about the main character or character. The Expendables has turned into the action version of the Ocean films which is basically the same premise bringing together great actors, but studios, directors and even the stars need to realize that bringing together these stars may mean big bucks, but it doesn't mean the film will actually be good. This is turning into a long paragraph. I would talk about the acting, but honestly there is no good acting in this film. During the film Chuck Norris miraculously shows up for some convoluted and convenient reason and saves Stallone's team and then gives some reason about being a lone wolf and disappears again. There really isn't any reason to care about the story or the characters. To be honest each of these action stars films are better than The Expendables 2.All right enough about the bad plot, non-existent characters or the ridiculous dialogue, and let's move on to the action, which is supposed to be the bread and butter of this growing franchise. I have seen a lot of good action films recently in Skyfall, El Gringo, Dredd and Looper. I know I know again defenders of this film will say action films are supposed to be over the top. Yes if it makes sense like for example the Die Hard films. Sure there was some unbelievable action scenes, but they weren't outrageously over the top like in The Expendables films. Directors and actors should know sometimes less is better than more over the top action. Having so many action stars in the film makes the scenes unmemorable and unremarkable. Stallone has plane with a cannon in its nose and he crashes it into a mine, so what and who cares. They climax is in an airport with a hundred unknown or indefinable bad guys while the good guys just shoot their guns and spout some ridiculous dialogue. The action and fight scenes have no meaning and aren't entertaining in anyway.On paper the idea of the Ocean and The Expendables films is a good idea, but as it's put together things quickly fall apart with too many characters to care about, an average to bad plot, bad dialogue and average to bad action or drama, and that is what both of these franchised suffered from and to a lesser extend The Avengers. Like I said once you get over the excitement of seeing all these famous actors, action stars or superheroes together you see the flaws in the film. Overall The Expendables 2 is a bad action film which has limited value in seeing all these action stars together and a few funny lines.

$review_text.: Well, this movie did not really live up to its title. To me a movie can't really be a cliffhanger because we are watching everything in one straight shot. Doctor Who on the other hand was brilliant at just simply leaving the story hanging drawing the audience back the next night, or week, to see how the situation was resolved. Cliffhanger was not like that. It did not keep me gripping my seat and the only thing I was waiting for was for the bad guy Qualin (John Lithgow) to die and the movie to end.I could end here because to me there wasn't much in this movie that I have not seen before. The scenery didn't thrill me and the cinematography wasn't all that crash hot (unlike Bad Boys where it is brilliant). The reviewers seemed to have loved this movie but personally it may have been breathtaking in the cinema, but it was not at all breath taking for me. Stallone's character does not need a name because the character is simply Stallone. He is a very good actor but when directors cast him to be the typical brutal action hero then I am not really impressed. Tango and Cash was not Stallone and that is what I liked. Here he was a typical clich&eacute;d hero in a different role, where as he might be a cop in one movie, he is a mountain man here. No real point to it.John Lithgow and his gang of thugs are pretty poor. They are just too brutal and evil to really catch my interest. They may have been cool and calculating in the air, but on the ground in the mountains they are just desperate, sadistic, and just running around with signs on their back saying "kill me please!" John Lithgow puts it aptly in his line, "I guess you want to kill me, well take a number and get in line." That is in line behind all of the audience who simply want to see him dead for being such a pathetic bad guy. Bad guys are supposed to have style and sophistication. They supposed to know what they are doing and have a goal in mind. They are also supposed to be intelligent, especially if they are able to pull off a mid-air heist such as the one the pulled in this movie. Lithgow is none of these, he even lacks the intelligence to know that you don't kill, or even intimidate your guides. You play it nice and easy. But if they were to do that then there would be little room for your stunts. Personally, I could probably rewrite this movie to make it much better.

$REVIEW.: "The Searchers" is about a five year hunt for a White girl (Natalie Wood) taken captive by Comanche raiders in 1868. John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards,a pitiless, obsessed, ex-confederate soldier who leads the search. "The Searchers" is considered Director John Ford's masterpiece and one of the top 100 movies ever made.I like Wayne, Ford, and Westerns, but "The Searchers" is not one of my all-time favorites. Wayne made better movies: "Red River" and "True Grit" come to mind. And Ford made better movies: "My Darling Clementine," for example.One reason to see "The Searchers" is the scenery. Ford loved Monument Valley in Arizona and Utah and the photography is awe-inspiring. Nearly every scene takes advantage of the magnificience of the natural scene. A second reason to see "The Searchers" is John Wayne. I've never seen a better image than Wayne's during an encounter with White women who have become Comanche. Without a word, his expression, shaded eyes, and three-day growth of beard convey absolute malevolence."The Searchers" is sporadically brilliant, but uneven. Scenes of low comedy spoil the mood created by Wayne's menacing character and Ford's fine photography.

$review_text.: Wow! Did she bring the house down!!!Watching this exhilarating piece of jazz performance was an  ecstatic experience.  For the second half of the concert, especially when she gets to the song "I Don't Know Enough About you", Diana Krall clearly loses herself and melts completely into the music.  The music flows like a river.  There is no thinking, no skills, no space, no time, just pure joy of music.  The whole band are right there with her.Every once in a while, a performer will totally lose control of him/herself and achieve amazing feat.  For example, Michael Jordan's winning shot in the final game against Utah (1998), Martha Argerich's Rachmaninoff piano concerto live recording in Berlin (1982), Sarah Hughes' golden performance in the Olympic figure skating final (2002) and Jodie Foster's ecstacy upon hearing the greetings from the outer space in Contact (1997).  I love watching live music or sports performances because I feel that the performers communicate with me with more passion and less instrumentality.By the way, the first song of this DVD is called "I Love Being Here With You", which may explain her exuberant performance of the night!

 Bursten really shines as a widowed Alice with her young son, Tommy, who dreams of going to Monterey and becoming a singer

 Instead, she ends up as a waitress in Mel and Ruby's Cafe and trying to love again with a handsome farmer, Kristoferson
 Great perfomances are abound in this movie


 Dianne Ladd is wonderful is great as Flo, the independent woman who takes no guff

 Jodie Foster stars as a teenage delinquent who gets Alice's son Tommy drunk on wine and teaches him to shoplift


 A warm layered rich story.

$REVIEW.: Run Lola Run was most definitely the alternative hit movie of 1999. While many movies were excellent in the past year, this stood head and shoulders above most of them. A little, comparatively low budget film, its director  Tom Tykwer (with his meaningful, if not literal, film debut) and strangely  intriguing star (Franke Potente) draw you into a world of possibilties, 3  possible possibilities to be exact.While Lola (Potente) spends three 20  minute sections of the movie running, frenetically rushing about to save  her boyfriend Manni's (Moritz Bleibtreu) life, the movie shifts from  tripped out cuts to animated interludes all to a pulsating techno  soundtrack. The viewer is taken along with Lola to experience her choices,  even the most subtle, and how they affect not only the outcome but also the  world around her. Woven into it, however, are Lola and Manni's life  together and throughout the film, bits of their psyches can be pieced  together to discover their very realistic relationship. The way Tykwer  incorporated character development into three 20 minute hyper-paced acts is  brilliant.Run Lola Run is definitely a star film of 1999. It deserves to  be seen on the big screen, but the DVD or VHS widescreen would be  acceptable substitutes, as certain things are lost to the pan &amp; scan  cropping. Make sure to steer clear of the dubbed version; even those of you  who hate subtitles will thank yourselves.

$REVIEW.: At first I was expecting this to simply be a little kids movie, but as it went along I was more and more intrigued by the characters and their talent and wit/cleverness.Chancellor Miller plays Jupiter in an enjoyable story of three boys who love investigating and finding answers to the unanswerable. Jupiter's ingenuity is much greater than anticipated and was actually fun to watch for a person who is used to the best in detective shows and films. The two boys who back him, Pete and Bob, are entertaining and pleasant enough. Pete acts as the cautionary one who is always the first in the safe zone, but last into danger. Bob, whom some may recognize from Music Man with Kristen Chenoweth, plays the brainy sidekick. Oddly enough, he finds all his research through books, which is unusual to modern movie goers because all the slueth films today have the nifty computer gadgets. Supposing though that the movie was coming out around 2007 in Europe and 2008 in the US. Being made therefore before 2008, it can be guessed that this was around the time when computers and cell phones were just beginning to be a big thing (iPhones first came out in 2007).A fun and enjoyable watch, great for any young slueths out there who want to sit back and take in an investigation!

The original focused a lot more on the mind games between Ford and Heflin.  But doesn't mean it is all bad -Pros: Terrific visuals, costumes and sets. Plenty of action.  Blu-Ray is everything you would hope for.Cons: Awful screen play, with most of the dialog being mumbled throughout.  Character development almost none existent, and little interaction except when shooting or getting shot out.  Ending was totally unbelievable.I know movies are made a lot different now a days, and high body count certainly sells at the box office.  But that doesn't always result in a well made film.  This one is going into my trash bin.

$REVIEW.: Just released today on DVD by Facets Video so I ran straight down to rent it.  Unabashedly campy, Aventurera pays definite homage to the Hays-Code American film noir style of the 1940s, while still maintaining the very Mexican form of the cabaretera drama.  According to the DVD special feature introduction, Aventurera was re-released in 1996 to critical acclaim in LA and NY.  This release (as opposed to a slightly earlier one by New Form Video) is thus aimed at the upscale North American art house crowd.  It has white English subtitles, somewhat annoyingly burnt onto the original images (no switching on or off, and no other languages).  The image quality isn't quite Jeanne d'Arc, but the black and white is sufficiently crisp and clear.  I haven't seen the cheaper release, or the VHS, and so can't comment on those.  For some reason with these Mexican titles Amazon almost never provides links to different editions as they do on all other films.Back to the movie, it begins extremely campy and continues on in that fashion for some time, but the quick ending has more subtle and delightful noirish turns of fate than any film I can remember.  I wouldn't dare spoil it for you.  The story is well developed, the acting is above average, and the scenes are produced professionally.  The (melo-) dramatic segments are framed by lovely little urban shots of Chihuahua, Juarez, and M?xico cities, as well as some jazzy Latin dance numbers, giving the viewer nice breaks. Personally my favorite number was the Samba one, performed in Portuguese.  If it was in color it would have been as spectacular as those from Singin' in the Rain.Cuban immigrant Nin?n Sevilla stars.  Unlike most of her fellow cubano immigrants to Mexico, and despite her platinum hairdo, Sevilla's ancestry definitely seems to tend towards the Afro-Cuban variety.  She gives a wonderful performance and brings a buxom star-powered presence to the film.  Mexican film aficionados will note that the villainess is played by none other than Andrea Palma, who starred in the 1934 film La Mujer del Puerto.  Mexican super-regular Miguel Incl?n (Dona Barbara, Mar?a Candelaria, Enamorada, Fort Apache, Los Olvidados, etc etc etc) gives a subtle but satisfying performance as the reluctant verdugo/enforcer Rengo.Certainly this film is a bit overrated and overhyped, but it grows on you.  While some of it seems clich?, so does the Godfather, because it was so often copied.  Expectations mean so much when watching a film.  Keep them within reason and you might be pleasantly surprised by Aventurera before it's over.  It reminds me just a bit of Gilda (1946), and obviously came right on the heels of Emilio Fernandez's Salon Mexico (1949).  The sleazy border scenes also seemed to remind me of Touch of Evil.  I think it certainly compares favorably with other films of the era like Key Largo, All About Eve, or Nights of Cabiria.  Definitely worth checking out.

$REVIEW.: This is one of the better indi films that a lot of people missed
 Vincent Gallo did a great job directing, writing, producing, and starring in it


 He plays Billy Brown, a lonely man who was just recently released from jail, who's visiting home for the first time in years

 Before he was locked up, he told his estranged parents a pack of lies so they would never know he was in jail, one of those lies was that he married his "high school sweetheart, Wendy"


 His parent's acceptance is very important to him, so he kidnaps a dancer, Layla (Christina Ricci), to pretend to be his wife Wendy

 Their reunion is full of awkward, sad, and funny moments.As the film progresses, more and more about Billy  Brown's life is revealed, and you really start to sympathize with him
 He and Christina Ricci, both kind of outcasts, fall in love


 I don't want to give anything away because it's really interesting to find out about Gallo's mysterious character Billy through the course of the film
 Everyone was perfectly cast, Angelica Houston was almost unrecognizeable as Billy's mother and Rosanna Arquette's cameo was great

 See this movie if you're looking for a unique black-comedy with a great cast.

$review_text.: This is a great horror film, especially for a sequel, and it would stand quite well on its own too. Unlike the first film, it doesn't entirely take itself seriously it is very self-aware, and it is just light-weight horror entertainment; nothing thought-provoking here. There are quite a few moments of extreme tension and horror such as the car pile-up in the beginning, that elevator scene and especially dentist scene. :DI was very happy to see Ali Larter back, she was great in the first one and was just as good in this one.  Tony Todd who was, unfortunately, only in the movie for but a few moments, is always awesome to watch. :(  A.J. Cook, who I had never seen prior to this one, is very good as the girl with the premonition this go-around.  The rest of the cast is good too.The gore is top-notch, if you're a horror fan, it is a must-watch.  As all ready mentioned, this one has a sense of humor, and is very self-aware, it doesn't take itself quite as seriously, which helps distinguish it from the first film, and really helps it along and ends it with a "bang"!!! :pIf you are unfamiliar with the series, watch the first one, and then this one.  No, it's not gonna change a whole lot if you watch it out of order, but there is some continuity from the first to second film, and it may not make as much sense without having seen the first one.God Bless ~Amy

$REVIEW.: I looked forward to seeing what William Monaghan could do on his own, away from the watchful eye of Martin Scorsese and a seriously overrated film like THE DEPARTED. He seems to have a good head on his shoulders, and a good ear for dialogue. But where THE DEPARTED lacked in gravity, LONDON BOULEVARD lacks in just about everything.Basically we have an ex-con (Colin Farrell, looking like he needs some Grecian Formula), his crazed drug-addled sister (an amazingly bizarre Anna Friel), his idiot criminal friend (Ben Chaplin, channelling his inner coke-fiend), a damaged and agoraphopic film starlet (Keira Knightley, happy to finally be out of those horrible PIRATES films), her stoner caretaker (the brilliant David Thewlis), and a prerequisite volatile, vulgar and racist crime boss (Ray Winstone, phoning it in here).The main problem with this film is that it starts out strong with a not-entirely novel concept of an ex-con trying to stay as far away as possible from re-entering that life but keeps being pulled by two opposing forces, but it spirals completely out of control once Ray Winstone enters the picture. His character is less of a fleshed-out character and more of a gimmick. He exists solely to force the protagonist of our film to certain extremes. Character arcs as well as storylines are left incomplete. There seems to be a great deal of footage that was left on the cutting room floor that might elongate the runtime of the film, but it might help to complete and clear up some gaping holes. I will never say that I don't love a great film that makes you think or wonder after the credits start rolling, but the story has to make sense first.Aside from the solid work that Farrell, Knightley (who continues to impress after films like the brilliant NEVER LET ME GO and A DANGEROUS METHOD), and Thewlis do, this film is so far beyond making any kind of narrative sense, it's ridiculous. No character is given an opportunity to get fleshed out; the dialogue is pretty rote for this type of film; the direction by Monaghan seems inspired at first, but then becomes less of a homage to the 70's British crime films that apparently inspired it and more of a ripoff.There's almost no level that the film works at other than the three performers I mentioned already, and the ending is beyond moronic. It's very rare I find myself shouting at a film in incredulous anger, but LONDON BOULEVARD did it.

$review_text.: I'd never seen a CSI serial before purchasing this set, and wanted to see what all the hoopla was about. Unfortunately NCIS isn't free yet on Amazon Prime, so I purchased the DVD set (at &lt; $20, I'm willing to take a chance). I chose NCIS as my introduction to CSI franchise shows because Pauley Perrette's character seemed to have potential in providing ongoing appeal (a goth on network TV who isn't portrayed as a reject dunce? about time!)PROs+ the acting by Mark Harmon and Sasha Alexander is convincing+ Pauley Perrette's character is enticing and adds flavor to an otherwise bland serial (Ducky helps too)+ the austere character Gibbs is balanced out by the less jaded attitudes of the other protagonists+ exposure to bits of Navy/ Marine Corps culture (assuming that there is some degree of realism to the program in this arena) helps to keep the show from being too boring+ um... having trouble coming up with other pros... I like the music during the opening credits?CONs- Abby Sciuto is not a believable character, despite her glowing presence that steals the show. She would have about five PhDs to do her job as portrayed. "Oh Gibbs, I can figure that out! I did one of my dissertations on different types of pine bark!" I know people who work in white jackets in labs, and while they may be quite intelligent, they are not a Jack or Master of all sciences. Plus, while I like that NCIS is trying to portray a goth as capable and brainy, Abby is still a Hollywoodized version of a goth. But thanks for trying.- Gibbs walks around with a big stick up his you-know-what. Makes me wonder if Mark Harmon is like that IRL. I suppose it could be an effective trait for a lead investigator, but it's difficult to enjoy a serial in which the central character is off-putting.- I know this first season was aired only 2 years after 9/11, but really do we need a terrorist hiding under everyone's bed in every other episode? If there were as many terrorists in the U.S. as portrayed in this series, you wouldn't be able to go to the grocery store without brushing up against one.- Plot holes galore. I don't need to go into detail here since the 2-star review by C. Franz covers some of the blunders in NCIS season 1.- Something almost unbearable about Michael Weatherly's character Anthony DiNozzo, can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe he was funny 10 years ago or something.- The humor falls flat too often. I think this is partly because television has improved since 2003, but that may be giving NCIS too much credit. The back and forth between DiNozzo and Caitlin is already wearing thin by the end of the season. The trite dismissal of Ducky (whenever he speaks more than 3 sentences about something interesting) is predictable to the point of being annoying.Final verdict: 2.5 stars. I find the show ideal for falling asleep to at night (whereas good shows keep me awake too late because I want to see how the episodes end). This seems like a serial from the 1990s rather than the 21st century. So much for my experiment with CSI shows... they are no better than BONES, from what I can tell.

$review_text.: As 712 other reviewers have more or less confirmed, this is a tragic story.  If you have even a shred of a soul you will be moved to tears, but this movie will do more that that.  You will be a different person after you watch it.  Many movies are sad, but Grave of the Fireflies finds that part of you where hope and despair meet, and lays it waste.  Watching the innocent slide inexorably to their doom is hard, but there is more to it than that. One child is dead when the movie opens, and another soon dies in a railway station.  The cleaning crew dispose of his belongings, including a small tin box that once contained candy.  When the story finally ends, the memory of that earlier scene will haunt you for a long time.There is a power in the simplicity of this animated film that a live-action movie could never achieve.  There is hardly any graphic violence.  Many scenes are languid and beautiful, and some are heartwarming, which makes the ultimate heartbreak all the more devastating.  You may want to watch this film alone.It is essential to see it with the original Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles.  The rhythm of the language and the tone of voice communicate a great deal of the emotion.  The English dubbed sound track makes me cringe, particularly the squeaky voice used for the young girl.

$review_text.: The outline must have been brilliant, and the execution was so flawed....With the exception of the title character -- who actually grows by the end of the film -- there is nobody in this story to care about.  The love interest played by Kate Blanchett agonizes over a previous relationship we never really learn about, maybe she's in love with the Owen Wilson character, maybe not, who cares, she doesn't seem to.  Angelica Huston mostly seems to be brooding over how she will take revenge on her agent for getting her into this turkey.  Willem Dafoe maybe reveals too much in the extra features when he mentions sitting around the set all week to deliver one line, at least he had a few good lines to deliver, few other characters were so lucky. There are whole scenes with absolutley no relationship to the rest of the film, it's almost as if scraps of film were picked up off the cutting room floor and spliced back into the movie at random, surely the deleted scenes were chosen by flipping a coin.  I suppose some folks see this "no rules" style as a terribly artistic rejection of convention, to me it just looks sloppy and self-indulgent.  This movie could have been so much better with just a little effort, but from the director on down it doesn't seem like anyone cared to work up a sweat.  The video store would have to be out of stock on every other movie ever made to justify renting this one....

$REVIEW.: We see at the end of the movie how this disease originated--don't fast forward!  The movie is documentary style and thus more compelling

 We see what happens when so many deaths cause panic and societal breakdown, as in the times of Spanish influenza, bubonic plague (or anthrax), AIDS--fingers pointed, distrust of government, government posturing, loonies out of wordwork, prayer to saints


 The microbiologist reviewer feels 95% of us don't understand this movie

 No: that's why the plot unfolds as it did--so we would


 But I did not know what the CDC and scientists would have to face with political machinations and Big Pharma greed...I should have
 This is a cautionary tale in my eyes
 Instead of using evolution as a political knee jerker or religious boogeyman, can we not study and learn from it, and try to be prepared?  Everthing evolves just as this movie will tell you, and so, "War of the Worlds"  As this movie will show you: panic ensues when we don't use our rationale, objectivity and intellect
 Soderberg and his excellent cast got the point across to me.

$review_text.: Batman the Animated Series was a classic for many people back in the day, and it's great to see that they've gotten all three volumes out on DVD.  Much of what I experienced when watching the first volume crosses over to the second.  First, the voice acting and music are the some of the best that any cartoon has ever had.  Second, the artistic styling of the show is fantastically well-crafted and moody.  Third, the script and dialogue is by and large very, very good.  The downside, at least now, is two fold: (1)at certain junctures, the animation seems blocky and childish when compared to today's standards, and  (2) certain episodes you thought were great as a kid turn out to be a little flat.  However, this volume in particular distinguishes itself from the first and the third volumes by having some of the more classic episodes of the series, episodes that hold up to adult viewing and are in someways timeless and rewatchable.  While the Volume One had some great introductions for various characters (double episodes for Two-Face and Clayface, the famous "Heart of Ice" for Mr. Freeze), and Volume Three is by and large the most consistent in episodic quality, Volume Two is great for its stand-outs.  These include:Perchance to Dream: an episode I remembered vividly as a kid and one that was even better to watch now.  The plot centers around Bruce Wayne awaking in his bed to find out that everything, from his parent's death and his escapades as Batman, has been a dream.  Well-scripted, creative, and with a great one-on-one battle at the end, this episode is one of the greatest and most unique in the Batman canon.  Overall: A+Almost Got 'Im: An episode framed by the classic Batman villians (Joker, Two-Face, Penguin, Poison Ivy, and Killer Croc) sitting in a darkened bar while playing poker and telling stories.  The dialogue is excellent, the stories are entertaining, the the overall structure is truly superb.  This episode has great rewatchability, and certainly deserves the status of all-time classic.  Overall: A+Joker's Wild: while not containing the best animation of the series, this episode sets the bar high for all Joker-centric episodes.  The dialogue is very, very funny, with a great lead-in of Joker and Poison Ivy squabbling in Arkham.  The quality of the writing continues, as does the quantity of the action, which is excellent.  There's a prison-break, a car chase, Batman fighting some thugs, Batman trapped on a giant roulette wheel with a grenade, a hang glider-helicopter chase, and a one-on-one Joker-Batman battle inside an out of control helicopter.  This is Batman at its most entertaining, and if you like Mark Hamill as the Joker, you'll love him in this episode.  Overall: A+There are other greats, including "Robin's Reckoning," "The Laughing Fish," "Off-Balance," and "I Am the Night."  As for the rest, the Riddler keeps things interesting, as does Kyodai Ken.  Some of the other episodes are a little disappointing, but with the high quality of the better episodes, this volume remains a great buy.

$REVIEW.: Trying to please a date, I allowed myself to be dragged to this movie. It turned out to be one of those occasions that you're glad you went along. Since I am estrogen intolerant (chick flicks) and many women are testosterone intolerant (manly flicks), this movie strikes a balance.It begins with two old men performing acrobatics in a biplane over a Texas twilight sky. But on the horizon is a self-centered and irresponsible mother who drops her son with the two great uncles he's never seen before. The disinterested great uncles agree to take him for the summer. The boy notices a trunk his first night in the house and begins to look at the pictures and past of both of these eccentric men. He is intrigued and discovers more about their past with each event he experiences that summer. The more he learns, the closer he gets to his great uncles, and they with him.When the mother returns to pick up her son, the climax begins, but that would be telling you the end of the story. I recommend you see it instead.There is humor and action without violence. Language or skin are not a problem either. This movie is highly recommended for all audiences. It's a keeper.I don't see that woman anymore, but I have shown this to several new dates since! They loved it.

$REVIEW.: When ALIENS was released in 1986 the studio made James Cameron cut over 17 minutes of film because they felt it was too long
Still the released film was over two hours, but audiences didn't seem to mind
 The film was branded an instant classic, setting a new standard for sci-fi, horror and action movies..


all at the same time
 It even earned Sigourney Weaver (returning to her role as Lt


Ellen Ripley) a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar nomination
 ALIENS proved that a sequel can live up to, if not surpass the vision of the original
It has been imitated dozens of times, but is has never been topped.Ripley awakens 57 years after A L I EN, only to find out that no one believes her story about a monster that gestates inside of humans, killing it's host (rather violently) at it's birth, grows very fast, has acid for blood and is pretty much an "unkillable" killing machine


 So they fire her and threaten to sue her for destroying the Nostromo (the company's ship in part 1)
 She's forced to live in a run down apartment building and gets a job working on the cargo docks because no one else will hire her...However, the company did send out some colonists to check out her story
The colonists are unaware that for the past 20 years they've been sharing the same planet with Ripley's monsters.That's the setup before all hell literally breaks loose.James Cameron masterfully choreographs a decent into the bowels of a planet taken over by a demon monster and her brood (and there are many of them in this one)


 This DVD edition includes the 17 minutes of cut footage, which adds tremendously to the narrative, filling in some rather irritating gaps that were left in the theatrical version

 Ripley is given a past, making her relationship with the little girl Newt more understandable

You actually see how the aliens took over the colony on LV-426


 So when the marines arrive at the colony, you FEEL the loss


 The movie is an emotional roller coaster ride and at the same time, a well-crafted nightmare


 The final 45 minutes alone will have anyone literally sitting on the edge of their seats


 Followed in 1992 by a somewhat mellower sequel, ALIEN 3.

$review_text.: The trouble with biographical films is most people's lives make for unsatisfying stories. Such films usually feel incomplete. A story requires a beginning, middle, and end -- with the protagonist's story arc unified by some "life lesson" or theme. But real people's lives are not stories, but a series of disjointed and messy episodes.WithThe Doors, Oliver Stone tried to "explain" Jim Morrison's life by depicting it as Morrison's quest for death, sparked by his witnessing a car accident in his youth. It was an unsatisfactory explanation in a fascinating film.Director Ariel Vromen's THE ICEMAN likewise fails to find a unifying theme for contract killer Richard Kuklinski's life. What lesson is to be learned from this film? Who was the Kuklinski? Why did he become a cold-blooded killer? There's a brief flashback showing him beaten by his father, but most victims of child abuse do not go on to murder over 100 people, so it's an unsatisfying explanation. I guess the best explanation is that Kuklinski was a psychopath. Which is a label rather than a cinematic story arc.Ultimately, films like THE ICEMAN exist to satisfy the morbid curiosity of those wishing a safe peak at "true crime." It's also a painless way to get a brief history lesson, though filmmakers always alter the facts.THE ICEMAN is an artfully made film. The 1960s, 1970s period sets and clothes look accurate. It's well acted. Michael Shannon comes across as, well, icy. The other gangsters are well portrayed. Winona Ryder is sympathetic in a smallish role as Kuklinski's wife.I can't say I enjoyed THE ICEMAN, but it held my attention, the way a car accident might. Yet it left me emotionally unsatisfied, as biographical films often do. What was the point ofBasquiat's life? The film was an interesting peak into the 1980s New York art scene, but it meandered aimlessly, as does real life. As did Kuklinski's life, as did THE ICEMAN.If you like gritty, true-life crime films (e.g.The Valachi Papers,The French Connection,Serpico), you should like THE ICEMAN.

Without a doubt I enjoyed season three the most, mainly due to Piven's great story line, and Dillon's constant wry hilarity. This is also the season where Ari's assistant Lloyd comes into his own, and he does it very humorously. The writing is strong throughout, the cast thoroughly tight with their comic timing, and in general I laughed my ass off frequently.While not the funniest tv show ever, it's certainly one of the best of the last decade, and this is one season I'll gladly rewatch in the years to come when I need some good humor.

$review_text.: The animated characters are not really that cute or cool, but Aliens In The Attic (2009) is serviceable, through perhaps not outstanding family entertainment.  Featuring kids trying to save their clueless parents from destruction, the story is one that would generally appeal to teenagers and below, with special effects that are solid, well-executed, and generally funny.Brothers Stuart (Kevin Nealon), and Nathan Pearson (Andy Richter), bring their families together for the summer, renting a house near a lake in rural Michigan.  The Pearsons are just settling in, looking to do some fishing, when alien ships crash land in their attic with four pint sized aliens aboard, who are the advance team for an invasion fleet.  Using special weapons, they take over the minds Ricky (Robert Hoffman), the boyfriend of Stuart's daughter Bethany (Ashley Tisdale), and also grandmother Pearson (Doris Roberts), controlling them via hand held controllers, similar to a video game.Fortunately the alien mind control devices do not work on children, leaving the Pearson kids the only thing standing between the aliens, and world domination.  Cousins Tom (Carter Jenkins), and Jake (Austin Butler) lead the fight, mostly battling them using toys.  Tom's little sister Hannah (Ashley Boettcher) develops a special friendship with one of the visitors named Sparks, which proves decisive in deciding the fate of mankind.The film features some short but lively action scenes, and an extended fight between Ricky and nana that is ridiculously funny.  The film's final battle gets all the kids involved, and features a couple of the aliens blown up to gigantic proportions, bringing this lightweight tale to a close.Kevin Nealon, Andy Richter, Tim Meadows as the sheriff, and Gillian Vigman, all provide good performances, but don't have much to do beyond playing straight men.  With a real gift for physical comedy, seemingly inspired by Jim Carey, Robert Hoffman is one of the bright spots.  Animated and adorable, Ashley Boettcher is a talented little actress, who usually brightens up the scenes she is in.Aliens In The Attic isn't a must see, but it's well produced, fairly entertaining family fare that may be a pleasant distraction for kids.
$review_summary.: fairly good family entertainment, with some decent special effects...

$REVIEW.: My Favorite Brunette is a classic that has apparantly been rescued. Hope is cast as a Baby Photographer who wants to change careers. He wants to be a detective. His studio is located in an office building in San Francisco juxtaposed to that of adetective who is played by Alan Ladd in a cameo role.Hope is alone when Dorothy Lamour comes into the office and asks for help mistaking Hope for a detective. She says that she wants help in finding her missing husband she also gives Hope a map and instructs him to guard it with his life. She then gives him an address outside San Franciso where he is to meet her.Then the movie takes off. Hope encounters Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr. among others. Lamour's sanity is questioned. Hope goes from location to location trying to solve the mystery. Hope even ends up in the gas chamber for murder. It is hard to tell where it will end or what will happen next but is all great fun. The laughs never stop. The pacing is fast but easy to follow. The only caveat is that the copy is not as pristine as would be desired but it is probably the best that could be provided for the transfer. I believe that one reason for this is that for some reason it does not seem to be owned by Paramount and therefore has not been preserved except for what we have here. The sound track is better than I expected. I believe this to be one of Hope's best and is a "must see" for all his fans. Bing Crosby has a cameo at the end of the picture. Once you start towatch this picture you probably won't notice the quality of the print: it is that good !  The direction is excellent, the quality of the production is very high. That is my reason for the 5 Stars.

$REVIEW.: Without question, Charlize Theron is easily one of the most beautiful women in the world
The transformation she makes to play a famous female killer who ultimately ended up in the electric chair is no less than astounding
I remember watching the Academy Awards the year she was nominated


I was going to be very upset if she didn't win

Thankfully, she did and deservedly so


The movie is worth watching if only to see her performance.The story of Aileen Wuornos is noteworthy I think mainly because she was a female serial killer and in Florida (where Aileen did her slaying) we don't have too many of those
And, we don't usually reserve a place at the electric chair (once famously called &#34;Old Sparky&#34;) for murderers.

$review_text.: Aliens  DVDSigourney Weaver is superb in this sequel to the movie Alien.  In this one:It is nearly sixty years (57 to be precise) after the conclusion of "Alien," Ripley and Jonesy the cat are still quite happily sleeping away in their cryo-freeze compartment aboard the shuttle after sending the first alien out the airlock. The film opens with a salvage crew opening up the shuttle and finding her and the cat! After she's awoken, she learns that she's been floating around for fifty seven years and the company she works for is none to sympathetic to her cause, basically blackballing her. Unbeknownst to her, the "company" sends someone out to investigate her story and not too long thereafter nobody from the planetoid is heard from again. This of course prompts the company to send the space marines and Ripley as an advisor to find out what happened to the people.What follows from there is one of the best and most intense Sci-Fi action/thrillers to have ever been made and I would highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of films in this genre!This review is for the June of 99 DVD release. I found that the THX and 5.1 Surround worked quite well for this film. The seventeen minutes of the restored footage for this film is quite seamlessly added to film and serves extremely well in enhancing the experience of this movie.Highly recommended for fans of Sigourney Weaver, science Fiction, and good action movies.Gunner  January, 2007

$review_text.: Christopher Guest first came to prominence in 1984, as an assistant and star in Rob Reiner's hilarious &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;.Guest learned at the hands of the master, and the last 20 years of his career have been spent on mockumentary efforts ("Waiting for Guffman", "Best in Show", and, in 2002, "A Mighty Wind", where he decided to satirize the 60's folk music movement, something he and his fellow Spinal-Tappers had once done as a skit on Saturday Night Live)

 There are hallmarks in Guest's work
 He utilizes a co-writer, the newly popular Eugene Levy (the best part of Steve Martin's recent "Bringing Down the House"), he has a regular cast of character actors that ad-lib their way through zany and satirical situations in all three films, and he conquers the art form of teasing fans and popular culture icons with gentle spoofing, double entendres, hidden meanings, and really great filmmaking.Although I enjoyed the film in the theater, it really came into its own when I was able to watch the DVD where I could marvel at the details and depths of Guest and Levy's imagination, and the brilliance of their comedy
 It's strewn throughout the film, but a lot is captured and hightlighed in the DVD's special features.The premise of the film is simple:Irving Steinbloom, aged icon of the 50's and 60's folk music scene, has died in New York

 His son, who followed him in managing folk music acts, Jonathon (Bob Balaban)endeavors to create a "PBN" concert in his dad's memory, bringing together three of dad's oldest and most famous acts

 We get to see the faded stars in their lives today, deciding to do the show, then practicing, traveling to the Big Apple and enduring some mild hoopla and memories

 Finally, we see the big event.It was easy to pick out the most outstanding performance of the film, it belonged to co-writer Levy (as Mitch), who completely convinces you, iron gray wig and all, that he is an unhinged,  deer-in-the-headlights folk icon, with much of his early musical promise deadened by the cornucopia of meds he's taken over the last three decades, to try to capture some mental stability


 To fully appreciate his performance, and the droll wit that drives Levy, see his ad-lib in the Special Features press conference, where Mitch does a completely credible and incredible speech, comparing Rap music to folk music


 You gotta see it to believe it!Strolling through the DVD also brought out the idiosyncrasies in the film and let me marvel at the comedic turns of the delightful Jennifer Coolidge (as Amber Cole, eastern European escapee and PR agent) and John Michael Higgins (as Terry Bohner
Leader of the "New Main Street Singers")

 Both were completely over the top in "Best of Show", and even more laughable here


 Both are amazing scene stealers, but you have to think back over the scene to realize it.In the Special Features, you're really crushed to find deleted scenes that should have survived the film's editing (particularly Coolidge in a deadpan "piccolo" joke), memorable songs ("The Good Book", by the New Main Street Singers, is hilarious) and the unmatched wry and acerbic humor of commentators Guest and Levy


 Guest, with amazing attention to detail, even filmed the concert portion of "A Mighty Wind" with TV cameras to be able to recreate the concert as it might have appeared on PBS or public access."AMW" is not for everyone
 Those who won't want to probe for the humor or the double entendre or can't reminisce about the golden age and the innocence of folk music will probably think it dull, dull, dull


 I've rated it four stars, because it pales in comparison to Guffman and Best in Show, but I must say, I really enjoyed the film.Guest is a genius at understated, satirical comedy and at making gentle, loving jibes at pop culture stereotypes

 Although "AMW" may be the lesser of his three films, it still proves that he is truly the king of film comedy

 Can't wait for his next one!

$REVIEW.: One of the very first movies I remember seeing as a very young boy was Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein on Million Dollar Movie on WOR-TV, Channel 9 in New York, in the early '60's.  I was so enthralled with this movie, that as I got older, it easily became my favorite A&C; movie...followed by Keep 'Em Flying...This movie never fit into the continuity of the other Universal "Monster" films, as the Wolfman had actually been cured in 1945 in The House of Frankenstein.  But how wonderful to see Lugosi reprise his role of Dracula..only the second time he would play the role...the first in 1930 in the original film 'Dracula"One thing to note is that in the laboratory battle scene, Glenn Strange, who played the Frankenstein Monster, had broken his foot, and was not the monster in these scenes.  Some say it was Lugosi and other say it was Chaney who played the Monster in these brief scenes.  Look carefully.  Both men played the Monster in previous films.A&C; Meet Frankenstein has been included in the AFI's top 100 films of all time.  Quite an accomplishment!!!!!

I really enjoyed "First Edition" drummer (& actor) Mickey Jones insightful commentary on each of the artists. He showed what a talented, fun and compationate man he is. For music buffs, his comments and tributes to these great artists were just as good as the music. Just listen to the bonus feature on artists such as Jim Croce and you feel what respect (and for some, a sense of loss) he had for his fellow music entertainers. His "behind the scenes" stories were very enjoyable.I can only wish that additional footage from this show follows this high quality DVD.

$REVIEW.: US history drama. A who's who of 1970s-1980s TV. The first NYTimes triple best-sellers adapted (but not closely) to television and now it's debatable which is best, books or miniseries? John Jakes authored the novels. A stellar cast in each of the 3 adaptations, so huge it's impossible to list all. It is `70s TV filming with SUBTITLES added. The music is good, sets and locations quite believable. It's a walk through America beginning in 1771 up to and past 1814. A lot of history, pioneer life, war, political change, and more in America's beginning steps leading to world prominence. The story is all seen through the eyes and lives of the fictional Kent family.Over 3 hours for each episode. Action, adventure, history, romance, violence, & sexual situations make it for mature youth and older. So nostalgic to see all the stars, for those who lived in the 1970s.The BASTARDS: 1771-1772Philip Kent started as the illegitimate son of a Duke. Troubles led him to the new world to seek his means. Andrew Stevens is a believable Philip in "Bastards" & "Rebels." Through the encouragement of Ben Franklin (Tom Bosley), Kent seeks a printer's job and ultimately gets involved in early Boston activity (yes, tea involved) and men that forge a revolution toward liberty. The series was considered low-budget, but how could it be with the star-power.Kim Cattrall (Philip's wife), Buddy Ebsen, Lorne Greene, Harry Morgan, Patricia Neal, Donald Pleasence, William Shatner (P. Revere), Noah Beery Jr., for starters.The REBELS: 1775-1781Philip plays a large role in the Revolution, working closely with Gen. Washington (Peter Graves), John Adams (William Daniels), Tom Jefferson (Kevin Tighe), John Hancock (Jim Backus) and soldier friend Judson (Don Johnson) is back from `Bastards.' Also returning was Cattrall, Bosley, & Neal. You see some war skirmishes but most of the action is away from guns, and the womenfolk are involved too.You visit Virginia, Boston, Ticonderoga, Philly, Cambridge, Valley Forge and parts betwixt. You'll run into stars: Doug McClure, Robt Vaughn, Wm Conrad (Narrator), Tanya & Forrest Tucker, plus.It's different from the book, so sit back and enjoy a TV action adventure Revolution.The SEEKERS: 1794-1814 and more.In 3 hours viewers see 4 Kent generations. Abe Kent (Randolph Mantooth) is primary, son of Philip (now by Martin Milner). He rejects a Boston printer secure life for the West (Ohio) with sibling Elizabeth (young slim Delta Burke). The west is hard, emotional, and heartbreaking, for the Kents and the viewers.Serious drama of the Wild West filled with TV western stars. Like Edie Adams as a cat-house madam, river boatmen John Carradine and Neville Brand, Robert Reed and Julie Gregg running a trading post, trapper Brian Keith, print editor Ross Martin, Ed Harris plays Clark with Skip Riley as Lewis. Roosevelt Grier takes a whip, Geo Hamilton is nasty, and Harriet Karr beautifully nasty. Many names left out, not to mention author John Jakes (also North and South author) playing a role himself.Although fiction, it represents the reality of pioneer America. Although adaptations, it dramatizes the essence of the novels. Although 1979, it is timeless from an enjoyable educational historical viewpoint. If you like Americana historical drama TV, also try "The Adams Chronicles." You can't get too many chronicles.

Like everyone, Roarke has his fantasies too, one of which is revealed in the "Return" fantasy.In Season Two, Mr. Roarke continues to display his deep understanding of human nature.  In the first episode, Tattoo has become despondent; no one takes him seriously; everyone just takes him for granted.  There is some great, heart-felt dialogue between these two.  At the end of the show, Roarke has a large crate brought out.  "It's for you from all of us ... You see, we realize that sometimes ... the ones we love the most ... are the first ones we most take for granted. . . ."If you have watched Season One, you are familiar with the usual scene of the guests stepping out of their seaplane, being presented with colorful leis and offered a tropical drink.  As the guests deplane, Roarke explains each of the guest's fantasies to Tattoo.  When the last guest has their drink, a beautiful woman provides Roark a drink so that he can welcome his guests with a toast; alas, poor Tattoo never receives a drink, that is until. . . .In the "Mr. Tattoo" fantasy, Roarke is surprised when Tattoo reveals that he has arranged to fulfill the fantasies of two beautiful women ( Barbi Benton & Connie Stevens) who desire to marry millionaires.  When Roarke receives his glass, a little girl brings Tattoo a glass, and then, Roark and Tattoo toast their guests together. . . .Speaking of beginnings, on disc 6 are two episodes where the guest arrive in a hot-air balloon; both episodes were Fantasy Island Sunday Specials.Picture (DVD): 3.5 to 4.5.  Unlike the DVD for Season One, there are no Subtitles, Languages nor Special Features.

$REVIEW.: A terrific tale for children, `The Spiderwick Chronicles' shows the plight of a NYC family moving into an old, decrepit house in the country while the children discover an ancient book that brings faeries, ogres, and sprites to life. Led by chief, Mulgarith (Nick Nolte), the ogres try to steal the chronicles from Simon, Jared, (both played by Freddie Highmore) and Mallory (Sarah Bolger) while Hogsqueal (Seth Rogen), a hideous changing forms leader, tries to destroy the children. Enchanting, transporting, and whimsical, 'The Spiderwick Chronicles' aims to please, even as it might be a bit too frightful for the wee little ones.Merits:1.) The movie's a whimsical throwback to the stellar Spielberg days of `E.T.' and `Gremlins' with Highmore more than a passing resemblance to Elliott (Henry Thomas).  Thumblejack (Martin Short) is a charming (if not high strung) original.2.) Faeries, ogres, and sprites have their day once more in big screen splendor.3.) The haunting gives the house a personality, reminiscent of the quality of `Monster House' and `Poltergeist'.  Suspension of belief is in high size (as are the special effects).4.) Excellent portal for the imagination with a good plug for the magical powers of books.5.) The screen presence of David Strathairn (as past portal figure Arthur Spiderwick) and believable performances all around.Demerits:1.)  Some of the film's elements are familiar.2.) It could provide too many nightmares for parents with lingering images of tomato sauce splattered on the walls with holes poked through them.  Potential Amber alert false alarms are presented with missing children hunting down ancient ancestors and fighting goblins.

$REVIEW.: We LOVE Veggie Tales, own all of them, and are thrilled that our kids enjoy them.  That being said, "It's a Meaningful Life" was cute, but it just didn't have the same spark and Biblical connection that we enjoy from other Veggie Tales DVDs.  The last few have strayed away from the Bible stories and--while they still teach important lessons--we miss that.  I guess it appeals to those who wouldn't consider a Bible-based show, so it has its merits.  Larry and Petunia seem to be the main characters in so many of them lately, but maybe I'm reading too much into it?  The Silly Songs are as clever as they've always been, just amazing.  I actually like the newer songs more than the old school ones as they've been hilariously referencing pop culture.  I think this is worth adding to your collection if you're a VT fan, but our kids never ask for this one; "Little Joe" is our favorite and worth adding to your collection.  The "3-packs" are a wonderful deal, too, and an easy way to build your collection with some awesome Veggie Tales classics. :)

$REVIEW.: I Remember MamaI Remember Mama is a wonderful movie for the whole family with Irene Dunn in one of her best roles.  This is the story of a family in 1910 San Francisco, the children first generation Americans and the Parent emigrents from Norway.  The family is richly composed of the Aunts and Uncle Chris and the Woman.  I recomend this film highly as one of the great classics from the golden age of Hollywood.

$REVIEW.: I am a sufferer of multiple food and chemical sensitivities, to the point where I can barely go out into the real world myself and am forced to live a life that most people would find weird to the extreme, avoiding just about everything. That was why I decided to watch this movie. I thought that it was about time someone made a movie about the illness, which is a very real and serious disease. So I sat down to watch the film with an open, receptive mind, ready to be dazzled.I could not have been more disappointed. This movie was a steaming heap of garbage. The scriptwriter clearly did not understand the illness...that was glaringly obvious. Just as annoyingly, I don't think he knew how to write a decent movie script. It was slow and annoying, and don't expect to feel any empathy for the characters, even the sick ones. I kept waiting for the main character to wake up to just how insane the health cult she joined was, but she never did. I mean, telling people they were sick because they wanted to be? Please, how stupid would you have to be to believe something like that?This is a real illness, and a serious one. Immune system disorders are on the rise in society. More people are suffering allergy and asthma and diseases of the immune system than ever before. It's a medical fact, and one that needs a lot more attention than it's getting. But I would rather it got no attention at all than to have cruddy movies like this made about it!There is a good reason this movie didn't rake it in at the box office...it's not to do with the fact that it's about an illness; I mean, movies like 'Awakenings' and 'Lorenzo's Oil', not to mention all those movies about people dying of cancer, and the numerous tv shows set in hospitals and medical practices, prove that medical stories are actually box office and tv gold if they're handled in the right way by decent scriptwriters. But this film is just so DULL and idiotic and poorly written and badly filmed...you would have to pay me a LOT of money to sit through watching this again!This movie may have some limited appeal to people who know NOTHING about the disease it's supposed to be about. Voyeurs, the uninformed, posers who like 'alternative' movies no matter how bad they are, and people who like watching freak shows may find an interest in the film.  But for anyone who likes fast paced, well written entertainment, or who wants to learn about the FACTS of this disease and its true and devastating impact on the way its sufferers live, then I would suggest looking elsewhere.If you want to know more about the illness, I suggest watching two exceptional Australian documentaries, 'Canary in the Mine' and 'The Final Insult'. They're difficult to get hold of, but well worth seeing.

There really is no sense in describing the details as everyone knows. I only have one issue and these days it seems so immaterial but the leading women is having an affair and is willing to forsake her marriage. It seems that our society has a problem that it did not have in the older days but folks are not committed to marriage, and when I watch these movies I think I understand why.

$review_text.: Great production values & strong acting despite inferior, agenda-driven  writing. For example, the permanent resident is elegantly played with dazzling warmth & charm that would have been a trademark of someone in her position. The hall porter is beautifully acted. An interesting period of social change & increasing social permeability. Yet, I agree completely with the reviewers who note this is written with a strong (& very dishonest) modern socio-political agenda. This cultural dishonesty & inauthenticity mars an otherwise lovely series written by very clever technicians - not artists. Charles Dickens they ain't & Upstairs Downstairs this ain't . . . If the writers insisted on portraying prostitution/homosexuality/gang rape etc. they should have ALSO portrayed genuine Christian faith & piety widespread in England in this period. But the agenda was neither historical nor artistic truth. Classic political tripe: enobling the working class while portraying the advantaged as uniformly unethical & greedy. Burdened with cliches: eg it's OK to sell your body to make money, but pursuing money in business makes you an automatic bore or bad guy; eg all ex-WWI soldiers are portrayed as wimps, criminals, cowards or neurotics--unless they're gay & then they're stable & likeable. Not an authentic or truthful work.Tantalizingly underdeveloped because the writers abandoned very rich characters & nascent storylines to score political points. Watch for Snidely Whiplash, Little Nell, etc. The agenda-driven writing isn't subtle. Characters typically aren't fully developed because they exist to score points the writers are intent on making. That leaves one vaguely dissatisfied as characters with fascinating potential come, go, languish or morph in somewhat cavalier fashion. A flawed & dishonest work with a strong socio-political agenda. That rankles & keeps The Grand from being first rate.Yet, if you love the visual beauty of lush English period dramas, if you can enjoy melodrama, and if you are willing to overlook the inappropriate intrusion of 21st century PC thought police, this can still be worthwhile. With such technical brilliance in production values it is a shame The Grand could not reach its own potential because its own creators had other agendas. The writers and producers should re-visit Shakespeare to learn how to tell a ripping story with a full range of human behaviors from noble to base that is still compassionate, culturally truthful, and complex. In The Grand, Iago -- and Uriah Heep, for that matter -- would have both been downtrodden victims and we the audience would have been clearly instructed to admire them for for their resiliency and get-up-and-go.There's much to appreciate here, but much to be ignored...

$review_text.: In 1996, HBO produced a documentary, &#34;Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills&#34;, about the much-publicized murder case of three young boys, Stevie Branch, Michael Moore, and Christopher Byers, who were murdered in the wooded creeks called Robin Hood Hills near West Memphis, Arkansas. The local authorities were convinced the murders were enacted by three older male teens, Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley, Jr., and Jason Baldwin. According to the present film and the HBO documentaries, they were targeted by authorities as suspects in a kind of modern-day witch-hunt because of their interest in the occult, horror films, and Heavy Metal music. Echols was often seen wearing black clothing, an affront to the predominant Christian community of West Memphis. He later admitted to reading about Aleister Crowley but asserted he had never read any of Crowley's actual writings.The case against the three teens hinged primarily on the notion that the murders were committed as a kind of sacrifice in a satanic ritual. Also, dubious testimony, particularly that of Vicki Hutcheson and her son Aaron, was later recanted. Hutcheson claimed initially that she had seen the three teens involved in Satanic rituals and that Damien Eckles had bragged about committing the murders at the event. She later said she had been coerced by police to offer false evidence, fearing authorities might take away her son. Her son Aaron in a video-taped interview said he had seen the actual murders, but then later when he was older withdrew his testimony claiming he knew nothing about the crimes. Other evidence, such as the possible involvement of an African-American who ended up in the ladies' room and smeared blood on the walls at Bojangles Restaurant the night of the murders was never adequately followed up on. No actual physical evidence linked the boys with the murders. Their prosecution was mainly based on circumstantial evidence concerning their interest in the occult.Twenty years after the convictions of the so-called &#34;West Memphis Three&#34; and 17 years after the HBO Documentary &#34;Paradise Lost&#34;, the film &#34;the Devil's Knot&#34; based on the book of the same name was released, starring Colin Firth as Ron Lax, a private investigator who became interested in the case, and Reese Witherspoon as Pamela Hobbs, the mother of victim Stevie Branch. First off, the film is beautifully shot. The lush swampy areas portraying the Robin Hood Hills appear almost like photos you might see in a postcard. The night shots are particularly beautiful, although simultaneously horrific as the setting for the brutal murders.Critics claimed the film didn't add anything new to the understanding of the case, but I don't believe this was the filmmakers' intentions. The point of the film I believe was simply to tell the story in a dramatic/narrative format rather than a documentary. (HBO produced three documentaries in all about the case and probably assisted in the revelation about the poor police investigation, the witch-hunt sensibilities towards members of their community interested in the occult, and the dubious testimonies which led eventually to the release of the West Memphis Three.) Apart from whether or not audiences will believe the West Memphis Three are guilty or innocent, much of the film is about the complexity of such cases. Unless a defendant truthfully confesses to a crime, many questions and strange circumstances surround most cases. In many instances, the whole truth may be nearly unobtainable, such as questions which still surround the JFK Assassination.An excellent and underrated film. The main reasons &#34;The Devil's Knot&#34; works as well as it does is because of the fine acting, particularly Witherspoon, Firth, and an honorable mention to James Hamrick as Damien Echols, the wonderful direction, and also because of the film's point of view. The film shows both sides of the case. The local authorities were pressured by the community to find the three teens guilty since a rift between conservative Christians and those interested in the occult was growing wider. In the film, one character states that those interested in the occult were bound to become enmeshed in a crime case sooner or later. Of course, the most informative details can be found in the three HBO documentaries, &#34;Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills&#34; (1996), &#34;Paradise Lost 2: Revelations&#34; (2000), and &#34;Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory&#34; (2011).

When the first book, Hunger Games, was released in 2008, ever searching for good secondary, pre-adult literature, we found in it a strong, believable young woman to whom our daughters, which at the time were 12 and 15, could relate. The movie has it's weak points, diverges from the story line at times, some of the characters in the movie do not match the book characters, esp. Haymitch - played by Harrelson? just bad!, while Jennifer Lawrence was spot on for the title roll of Katniss Everdeen, but overall keeps the main theme intact.

$REVIEW.: "Below" begins as a pretty good WWII submarine action adventure, but slowly builds into a far above average supernatural thriller. The acting is very good, as is the score, the sound design, production design, and the editing - this is not some slapped together mediocre low-budget movie. The producers are clearly sincere in their efforts to convey a meaningful story (with actual character development and solid themes), while keeping things very creepy. One of the best aspects of the story is that the viewer is never certain whether the submarine is haunted (what a great idea! Horror fans love those isolated settings!) or whether what the characters are experiencing is the result of  O2 deprivation or stress. My only complaint is that the viewer is likely to be ahead of the curve with regard to the mystery behind the haunting - I think the director drops a couple too many clues too early on; but this is a minor complaint. Easily in my top 10 ghost story flicks.

The war is basically lost, but HQ has made it clear that these men, who are exhausted and nearly out of ammo, are to hold their positions. Well, if that's not bad enough, there is also the possibility that the bunker is haunted! THE BUNKER is a cool blend of WWII action and supernatural / psychological terror. While there are no flesh-eating zombies, nazi torture chambers, or other such things, there is a building atmosphere of creeping dread. The story is also sound w/ believable characters.

$REVIEW.: The movie begins with great flair. No one plays haughtiness better than Geoffrey Rush, and in this film he is so afflicted by it that we know he&#8217;ll be knocked on his ass in subsequent scenes.Something obviously shady is taking place between the auctioneer and an accomplice at the auctions&#8212;some kind of cheat. But it&#8217;s cleverly and enticingly concealed. The movie begins with power, and it draws the viewer in.The movie begins with mystery and an abundance of beautiful works of art. The visuals Rush encounters everywhere he goes are overwhelmingly rich. I was hooked at once, but it didn&#8217;t last for long. The motif of the audible but invisible damsel in distress, neurotically whining away in some hidden nook of a villa packed with fascinating artifacts, wears thin after only a few scenes. And that recurrent motif is beaten to death. Finally, one feels, the screenwriter had a failure of imagination. A plot held tightly together at the beginning begins to meander and drift, and by the time I ejected the DVD, forty minutes from the end, the script seemed as if it had been written by a committee in a bar over a couple of pitchers of beer and a joint passed around under the table. The structure is loosely, or even accidentally, held together. The dialogue lacks the tightness that all fine films require.The production designer created a fabulously detailed Geppetto&#8217;s workshop for the gear-head character. It&#8217;s a feast for the eyes. But without a plausible and engaging plot, no cinematic feast can satisfy the viewer.

$REVIEW.: There have been five of the "Resident Evil" movies now, all either written or directed by W.S
Anderson, who I'm not a huge fan of

When he brings his mind-numbing nonsense down to relatable level and doesn't get as ridiculous as he did with 2011's "The Three Musketeers", he has skill and he sure can bring the carnage like the best of them


So combining the ultra-popular genre of zombies with science fiction action appears to be a good recipe because this series, based on a very popular videogame, has been successful and has a reliable following.I have to admit, as much as I'm not a huge fan of Anderson's, I have enjoyed this series

There are requirements for viewing a "Resident Evil" movie
First of all, you have to know at least some of the background from the videogame and the characters


Alice (Milla Jovovich) is the most popular character and the one you need to know the most about

Course there is also Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) who had her own starring role in the video game series


In this film, she works for the Umbrella Corporation, a company bent on world takeover with a T-virus and cloning.There is so much back-story and history to this series that I couldn't possibly go into it and still write a review without losing you halfway through, so I won't

The movie even starts with a fairly long back-story, but even it doesn't help

You either know, or you don't.The problem with the "Resident Evil" series is the lack of feeling you get from endless gunfire and explosions
In a series that has humanity in peril around every corner, the lack of humanity in its storytelling has been its achilles heel

The action has always been cool and intense, but at some point or another, the relentlessness of it sort of desensitizes you
Eventually, the cool effects lose their impact


That being said, "Resident Evil: Retribution" did something about that

Nothing sucks an audience into a perilous situation like an eight-year old girl with a hearing impairment
As the movie unfolds Alice finds herself attached to her daughter, a clone, and you as an audience member are just as concerned for that girl's safety.The story is convoluted, but some of the best action sequences in the entire series are present here

They aren't overwhelmingly ridiculous

Insert some humanity and feeling in the form of an eight-year old deaf girl who is probably the only actor in the film who brings the movie down to reality, and "Resident Evil: Retribution" is one of the best of the series


I don't know how much that is saying

You're either a fan, or you're not

"Retribution" is a decent time at the movies.

$review_text.: I was surprised by this fast paced drama. It drops you right in the middle of the story, takes off and keeps on moving. The action isn't wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of each episode. Some mysteries go for several episodes while others don't take long at all. In that respect it's more like real life. However, there is a bit of a McGyver tone to this. Nobody in real life could ever have this much drama, coincidence, knowledge or luck. The fun depends on that being the case though, so just suspend reality and hold on for the ride!The story lines are touching. The viewer gets to see what motivates the main character and how he got where he is today. There are family and love elements that go along with the investigations that give it a bit of depth. The cast was well chosen. They did a good job- I especially loved the darling little girl/daughter! The scenery also captivated me as it is so different from what I am used to seeing.Case Histories is a different kind of detective series that is worth a look... but do leave the subtitles on if you are watching from the USA. Some of the characters are completely unintelligible.

$review_text.: Woody's heroes/heroines are the romantics of all epics, eternally uncertain of themselves & their place in the world (so he loves F. Scott & Zelda); but here he also professes admiration for the clear-sighted who offer advice to the lost romantics among us (so he loves Hemingway & Stein as well); and there's even a passing nod of recognition to the unhinged (Dali, Bunuel, Man Ray).His villains are those who use intellect or artistic talent as a weapon of seduction or social dominance. And American pragmatism/materialism that seems designed to alienate us from our finer qualities.With Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen continues his critique of American identity/aspirations. Like Henry James, he finds it easiest to study Americans when they are in foreign locales. But all of the old themes are here as well (underconfident romantic up against overconfident poser; romantic/artistic disappointment tempered by humor; bittersweet Chaplinesque ending).The only thing that makes the 70's Woody Allen films (Annie Hall, Manhattan) better than the current series (Match Point, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Midnight in Paris) is the absence of Woody Allen. This was not as noticable with Vicky Cristina Barcelona because the leads were female, but here its almost impossible not to imagine a younger Woody doing all of his signature things with this role. Owen Wilson does a fine job here, but Woody Allen himself playing this character and talking to Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Stein, Picasso, Dali etc....would have been out of this world.

$REVIEW.: A long-absent father returns after 12 years to his family.  Mother and grandmother are not at all thrilled by his sudden reappearance, and you get the idea that they're afraid of him.  Soon after his arrival, he and his sons embark on what is billed as a fishing trip.  The older son acts respectfully towards this stranger who hides his previous life from them, while the younger son is rebellious and disobedient.  The father acts sadistic and abusive as well as occasionally kind towards both, but they're basically terrified of him.  After driving and camping for a few days, they end up on a boat rowing to a mysterious island, where the father has something hidden away.  Not everyone survives the island, and we're left wondering what and who this man really is and why he came back.  A very atmospheric, moody film with many layers that I'm still separating out.  Definitely worth watching for the thoughtful viewer.

$REVIEW.: Killing Season (Rated R) is written by Evan Daughtry (Divergent and Snow White and the Huntsman) and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (Ghost Rider movies). The 91 minute 220px-Killing_Season_film_posterfilm stars two of my favorites, Robert DeNiro and John Travolta.During the war in Bosnia, DeNiro (portraying Benjamin Ford) and his platoon stumble on a Serbian soldiers who have decimated a village. They&#8217;ve raped the women and killed the men and children. Taking the law into their own hands they form a firing squad and take-out the opposing soldiers, shooting them in the back of the head. Travolta&#8217;s character (Emil Kovac) is one of those Serbian soldiers. Only he was left for dead.Angry, Kovac spends his life trying to track down the American soldiers responsible for the firing squad. Ford is a recluse. His marriage went to hell after the war. He barely knows his son. He lives in the mountians in a remote cabin and lives off the land.While on his way into town, Ford&#8217;s Jeep breaks down. Kovac, posing as a hiker on vacation, assists Ford with getting the Jeep started. They go back to Ford&#8217;s cabin and share dinner, and talk. Before long, it is clear that Kovac is there seeking revenge. Throughout, the two go at each other, back and forth. First Kovac has the upper hand. Then Ford. The torture they pour out is barbaric, and intense. (It almost is comical the cat-and-mouse game, if it weren&#8217;t so brutal).Basically, Kovac wants a confession. Ford wants to leave the past in the past. It seems like the only way this will resolve is if one of them dies &#8212; and they way they go at it, death seems highly likely!Killing Season was . . . good. I enjoyed it. It could be because of the actors, though. I am not sure. I do know I did not play with my phone during it. It held my interest. I could not wait to see what would happen next. It was neither actor&#8217;s best film, not by a long shot. But it was solid for a thriller. The story was interesting. Seeing each soldier&#8217;s different point of view was interesting. I give Killing Season 4 out of 5![...]

$review_text.: Just like the third book was by far and away the best in the written series, the 3rd seasonof the HBO series is absolutely exceptional. First two seasons I found myself intrigued by some of the storylines, but bored by some of the others. Not the case in the third season, at all. I found myself caring about every second of the show, from the titanic battle between the Starks and Lannisters, to John Snow's daring adventures amongst the Wildlings. I really can't think of one weak performance among any of the characters -- even some of the younger actors like the young man who played Joffrey just hit everything out of the park. Some of the actors are so good they actually improve upon their characters as they were written in the books -- the actor who plays Stannis Baratheon, for example, is just incredible and steals just about every scene he is in; or the actress who plays Ygritte, a very minor character in the books, but here you find you really care about the fate of this character (and her relationship with John Snow); or the actor who plays the impossibly evil Ramsay Snow, totally different from how I pictured him after reading the books (ie. he's small and kind of puny, almost looks like Elijah Wood's evil twin), and yet he is truly terrifying and utterly convincing as a pure and unapologetic sociopath. In short, this is by far and away the best installment in the TV series so far. Will they be able to continue the momentum into season four? If its only half as good as season three it will be absolutely worth watching.All kinds of pressure now for Martin to finish off books six and seven and really give this outstanding television crew something to work with.

$review_text.: "Five Star Final" is an expose of the morals of journalism which still holds true today. With superb Edward G. Robinson as the editor of the Gazette, the film investigates the repercussion of resurrecting a 20 year old murder case and the effect on the acquitted murderess and her family. There are really only 2 sets; Robinson's office and the home of the victims. Aline MacMahon, making her debut, inhabits the former as Robinson's secretary and she is outstanding, brilliantly conveying a whole life behind the facade of wise cracks and yearning for her boss. Boris Karloff, before hitting his fame in the monster genre, creates a particularly slimy character as Izapod, the bogus preacher and lecher who positively salivates at the destruction he causes. Marian Marsh plays the daughter of the murderess whose life is destroyed by the journal's actions. The climax of the film is her diatribe and she too is outstanding. The weakest link of the film is the antique acting styles of H. B. Warner and Frances Starr who seem to be from a different film and era. This may be due to the weak direction by Mervyn Le Roy for their scenes are staged very unimaginatively. In fact, the direction is mediocre all the way through but the players and the pungent script rise above it.The film has been issued in the Warner's Archive Collection which means it is very expensive, unrestored and contains no extras.  In this case, the theatrical trailer is included and the film has been remastered.  Note that remastered is NOT the same as restored for while the print and soundtrack are clear, it is not clean, stable or repaired.

$REVIEW.: This was a wonderful, subtle film about love, in its many different forms. Love in a failed marriage, high school crushes, the idea of a fantasy lover reincarnated, and the expectations of love placed upon the fantasy lover.Topher Grace was outstanding. There wasn't the barest hint of his character from That 70s show, which is refreshing, because in almost every Ashton Kutcher film there are plenty of hints. I always thought that Grace would be the better actor of the two, and I think we're starting to see that.Laura Linney turned in a wonderful performance as always. She's as reliable as a brownstone. I've never once seen an imperfection in any of her performances. Any scene in which she evokes emotions are perfectly done.One can't help but wonder how one would react in Louise's (Linney) situation, and the film did a very good job of sharing her reaction with us, so that we shared it with her. Her immediate attraction to Fran (Grace), and her immediate and passionate desire for sexual relations was compulsive. I found myself feeling sorry for, knowing that she wasn't having sex with him; rather, she was having sex with the F. Scott she loved from high school. It seems that she eventually came to love Fran for who he was, although the age difference was significant and didn't seem to be addressed at all. I would have liked to understand Fran's attraction to older women a little better. I certainly understand that very often younger men or women are attracted to older women or men (or the reverse), but usually each situation is unique, so to see what Fran's unique attraction was would have been interesting and very telling about who he is.To be honest, I wasn't expecting to like this film. The concept of reincarnated love is a territory that's been explored extensively (recently uncomfortably so in Birth, starring Nicole Kidman). I only rented the film to see if my estimations regarding Topher Grace were correct. Not only did I find out that they were, but I also enjoyed the film immensely. It was touching, intelligent, thought provoking, and layered. For a film marketed as a drama/comedy, that's fairly unusual - and refreshing.

The DVD version is nothing spectacular (no extra anythings) but it will probably keep forever now that it has been digitized.....so forget about the next generation in your family not being able to view the crumbling magnetic tape from your VHS copy.A classic for-the-ages Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton film from their peak period in 1967.  Directed by *the* Zeffirelli, what more could you ask for.  Oh.....you want a good score....this one is award winning.....Nino Rota.  There is absolutely nothing lacking in this version.....you can enjoy it every time.  It's one for kids to watch to see how much fun real Shakespeare can be.  It's one for budding actresses to watch to see Taylor at her best.  It's one for anyone studying the Bard in school to have under their belt.  And it's one for all the rest of us to enjoy again and again.

$REVIEW.: This film was shot in Yugoslavia in 1985, a few years before the Yugoslav Wars broke out. Watching this movie is not a bad way to see some Yugoslav scenery.As for the movie itself, it is so bad it is good, and it is tremendously funny at times. Some say that Gymkata is an unintentional comedy, but such a view requires an unimaginable level of incompetence on the part of the movie's producers, writers, and director. I suspect that the ridiculous campiness and the spoofing of the martial arts genre were intentional. Consider the line from our hero, Jonathan Cabot, as he tells the main villain to put his weapons away: "You can put your hardware back in your pants now." And then there is the exciting scene when the princess tears off her regal gown to reveal the sexy black ninja tights underneath. And the inexplicable scene when a crazy person deliberately cuts off his own hand. Or the touching moment when Jonathan hugs the father he thought was dead and the father is shot in the back with an arrow, but later comes back to town on horseback, still with the arrow sticking out of his back but otherwise looking fine. Stuff like this MUST be intentional! The only complaint I have is that none of the movie's worst villains die horribly or funny enough.I would recommend this movie to anyone in the mood for some silliness and laughter.

Other prefer &quot;King Creole&quot; ( A Stone for Danny Fisher) , myself I prefer this 1957 entry because it was his first color film..and much more.We are aware that Elvis, mom was in the audience during the filming in that theater scene. I suppose this was one reason why Elvis didnt watch this film much after the passing of his mom.There is nothing special abut the story ( its really his). The cast of Wendell Corey and Lizabeth Scott make it happen and adds some real character to the plot line. The songs , I think are Elvis, best. That includes the bridge &quot; Hot Dog&quot; and &quot; Cowboy&quot;Finally, this film has one of the few performances of Dolores Hart. Even the sweet Judy Tyler couldnt match Ms. Hart,s sincerity in performance. The original sound track on vinyl is worth big dollars. This is the way I like to remember Elvis.!!

$REVIEW.: Joss Stone has one of the most mature voices on a young person I have heard in ages!  Totally an old school feel, like back in the 60's when people could actually SING
 Her sultry, deep voice brings to mind a mix of --- a young Teena Marie, Mavis Staples, Janis Joplin --- and you just know she's got some skat in her like Ella Fitzgerald.It's cool that she got to write songs with Betty Wright, Lamont Dozier and other greats


 How this girl from the UK got so much soul....well, she just belongs

 I love her composure on stage when she puts her full passion into a performance
 And then you get to hear her giggle inbetween nearly every song
 Her slow delivery on "The Chokin' Kind" was beautifully haunting


 I can't wait for future projects from Joss because she can only get better

 AWESOME VOICE!!I give Joss 5 stars but I gave this DVD only 4, because as a lot of the other viewers mentioned --- the camera production totally sucked!  It's like they had 60 cameras and wanted to get shots in from all of them, so the angle kept changing every few seconds


 I bought the DVD to SEE JOSS
 A music DVD should make you feel like you were at the concert, with "some" added effects


 But they seemed to want every shot to be a special effect

 Totally, totally annoying


 I chose this DVD over her other ones because this included songs from 2 albums.I did catch Joss Stone's performance on Austin City Limits
 Even though it was only 30 minutes or an hour (Michael Mc Donald had the other half), it was easy to watch and an incredible performance


 I hope they will release it soon

 That performance was what made me look her up on a DVD.

The show is about two socialites best friends, Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie, and what their life is like when their luxury lifestyle is taken away from them and are sent to work and live on a farm. Paris and Nicole adventure is hilarious and entertaining as they try to survive life outside L.A. I watched this show on FOX because of all the talk about Paris Hilton, from her millions to party all night life to her infamous tape. I wasn't expecting anything that great but "The Simple Life" turned out to be the best reality show I've seen. Nicole Ritche, was more surprising, being open to doing all sorts of stuff. Nicole is also actually more fun to watch, but Paris still has her moments (ie "What's Wal-Mart?"). This is a DVD that you can watch over and over again.

It introduced some really interesting backstory to the mythology of the series, but it wasn't explored at all or even explained in any meaningful way. The spheres only make a brief appearance in the start of the film. Of course, all the original actors are back in this one. They're all a little older and a little balder. Before I saw this movie I had heard it was going to be the epic, final chapter in the series. This statement could not be more wrong. It was not epic and it was definatly not the last installment. I can only hope that this movie was lacking because it's giving you the info you need for the next movie, which I hope is the epic I've been waiting for.

 But then again, it's so different from the Da Vinci Code, it's really an entirely new undertaking with a whole new set of challenges


 The special features are fascinating, including how they had to build their own Sistine Chapel and St Peter's Square
 There's a nice documentary on Cern

$review_text.: By RivetAgatha Christie's Poirot, The Movie Collection Set 6, consists of three discs, each with one mystery by Agatha Christie the queen of mysteries. The three discs are approximately 267 minutes long; about 1 hour and 29 minutes each. They all star David Suchet playing Christie's favorite sleuth Hercule Poirot. Ariadne Oliver, a best selling writer of mystery novels and Poirot's friend, appears in Halloween Party. They have stereo sound and are in the 16 to 9 wide screen format. These are some of Christies most entangled mysteries, and one, The Clocks, approaches being a blend of  mystery and international intrigue.The Three Mysteries are:Three Act Tragedy, (1935) also published as Murder in Three Acts:Act one begins with a social gathering and dinner at the magnificent house of Sir Charles Cartwright perched high above the sea on a narrow rock out cropping. Charles Cartwright was a famous film actor who had just decided to retire and fill his spare time with a sparklingly beautiful, very young girl who called herself "Egg". The Dinner was originally set for thirteen, including Hercule Poirot and his batman Hastings, until Sir Charles's secretary, Miss Milray, who had an eye for Charles, volunteered to join them in order to avoid the unlucky number of thirteen at dinner. Cocktails were served on an open tray and as soon as a drop of the drink touched the lips of the Reverend Stephen Babington he gasped, bent over contoured, and dropped to the floor, dead.Act two takes place a week or so later, when during a similar dinner party, Sir Charles's friend and psychiatrists dropped dead after taking a sip of his wine.In Act three, several days later, a nice old lady staying in the psychiatrists clinic dropped dead after taking a bite of a piece of candy from a box that arrived by messenger. Autopsies prove that all three killings were caused by the rarely encountered deadly poison nicotine, a pure liquid alkaloid which causes respiratory failure and paralysis, killing the victim almost instantly. As you may remember Christie was exceptionally good with rare, untraceable poisons. Poirot assembles all of the participants and names the responsible party.The Clocks: (1963) The mystery takes place at Wilbraham Crescent, just before World War II. A dead man in a grey suit is found in the living room of a blind old lady who works for a near by photographer. The body was found by a typist-for-hire from the Cavendish Secretarial and Typewriting Bureau. There were five clocks in the living room but the blind lady insists that she has only one clock, a cuckoo clock. Poirot has volunteered to help a special section of the British Secret Service and was assigned to this case. He shares the spotlight with Colin Lamb, the son of an old friend. There are more killings and the authorities are stumped but Poirot solves the case, clears the typist-for-hire, and helps her find a husband, Colin Lamb.Halloween Party (1969): The fatal Halloween party takes place in Woodleigh Commons, which is about 30 or 40 miles outside of London. A thirteen year old girl who had boasted of having seen a murder is drowned while bobbing for apples. Who could have done such a cruel thing? Ariadne Oliver, the famous mystery writer who was a guest at the party, calls on her friend Hercule Poirot to come to Woodleigh and solve the mystery. Amid a large and beautiful topiary garden a number of people have gone missing. Every topiary garden must have a topiary gardener to care for it and this one is always looming among the plantings. Poirot solves the mystery and the solution surprises everyone.These are three delightful Poirot's by Dame Agatha Christie; they are must have for every collector of the best in British mysteries. Buy them and you will be able to enjoy them with family and friends many times over.

$review_text.: Blow Dry was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Alan Rickman, Natasha Richardson, Bill Nighy and Josh Hartnett among others, though by no means is it a bad movie.The British Hairdressing Championship competition is a broken family's last opportunity at reconciliation...In short, the acting is pretty good (though nothing great), the setting is average, while the dialogues and the plot are below average.The major setbacks are in relation to:1) The weak plot and especially the weak dialogues, for which the writers are to blame.2) Rachel Griffiths was not that great as Sandra.  Just as bad were the actors playing the minor roles.3) Josh Hartnett's attempt at a British accent was sad.4) Alan Rickman, Natasha Richardson, Bill Nighy and Josh Hartnett were given terrible lines.  What a waste of an AMAZING cast!It seems as though the actors/directors/producers went to England on vacation separately, while there they met up with each other at the hotel lounge over drinks, and then decided, on the spot, to make the best of their stay by doing a quick and easy film on the side for some extra cash/spending money.Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers.In a nutshell, it's an ok movie and that's about it; no masterpiece here... Wait till they show it on TV.

$review_text.: I cannot believe a movie that was over 3 hours long got so little accomplished.  Ther look of the film starts out very good but when they get to the island it is like watching a cartoon.  All that I heard about this movie was how awesome the fights are but they dragged on as badly as the rest of the movie does.  Jack Black is not bad playing an actual actor though he does not have a lot of range.  The thing that really set me off was that he has the final words of the movie and wtf, he ends up being the smart one?I hate to repeat something I have I have read on here about a hundred times but I must say it again, do not expect anything close to Lord of the Rings.  Overall there are some touching moments with Kong but I would really recommend this movie to children.

$REVIEW.: Like a previous reviewer stated, the title didn't catch me
 The cover (I was 8 and judging by the cover was the way to tell) looked bored and showed off a boring deal

 It didn't help that it looked rural

 It just looked dull!How wrong I was!  I haven't watched this movie in probably five years, but I remember it's magic


 It was just a great, simple movie
 You could relate to Jay-he was the troublemaker, yet often felt ignored
 Corey Sevier is one of those actors that you see everywhere but you can't quite put your finger on it--but he's great!The highlights of this movie are simple scenes, really

 Unlike most, there's no HUGE event that leads the movie


 That said, it's a simple movie that even young kids can enjoy


 Kids who's favorites movie list upon the Fast and the Furious, may not like it because it's not that kind of movie-but sensitive children are sure to love it!

$REVIEW.: STARSHIP TROOPERS 3: MARAUDER, third in the series and released in 2008, should thank its lucky stars that the truly horrid HERO OF THE FEDERATION came before it, in effect NOT making MARAUDER the worse entry in the series

Like HERO OF THE FEDERATION, MARAUDER is a direct-to-video release


And while not as cringingly unbearable as HERO OF THE FEDERATION, it's a pretty bad movie
Still, this one tries to instill a sense of humor on the screen, so the satire and campiness earn it some style points.A decade after the events of the firstStarship Troopersmovie, the future of humanity and the Federation is still very much up in the air

The alien bugs keep on pressing


Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), now a grizzled veteran and a Colonel, is still doing his part
Except he still tends to go his own way, instead of playing party politics

This lands him in trouble with a former friend, now an officious General
Court martialed and about to be hanged, Rico is given a last-second reprieve when he's offered command of a covert mission, the objective of which is to rescue troopers stranded on OM-1, a quarantined bug planet which houses possibly the most dangerous bug of all.Oh, man, STARSHIP TROOPERS 3: MARAUDER
So bad it's funny, and with enough cheese to get a decent wine tasting under your belt


Given, the budget is very meager


So right away you lose that epic scale shown in the first film


The special effects are, naturally, less than stellar


Explosions which won't wow anyone, cheap-looking shots of Federation vessels in space, gore which is more hokey than gory, and bugs which aren't convincing

The bugs here look like creatures on loan from Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers or, perhaps more aptly, from theRoughnecks - The Starship Troopers Chronicles - The Complete Campaignsanimated series

Not to knock the Roughnecks cartoon, because that was pretty awesome
But there's a difference between CG work in a cartoon and the CG in a live action flick


And, really, when the danger doesn't look real, how can you invest in the peril?The film title "Marauder" refers to the code name given to Rico's seven-man crew tapped to undertake the secret ops to OM-1

They get to gear up in the latest line of mobile infantry armor
Thing is, these gynormous armor suits only show up the last few minutes of the film, and they end up being more anticlimactic than anything else.And you can't blame the tiny budget on the dubious story and script

And the acting? Baaaad, brother, it's bad

Casper Van Dien, not about to ever win an acting award, is still the best actor here, which says something about the rest of the cast


But the film could've definitely used more of Johnny Rico in action and less of Jolene Blalock and her very exasperating group on the bug planet

I had some hopes for Jolene, she of the sexy Vulcan role inStar Trek Enterprise - The Complete First Season
But, it turns out, she wasn't good, either

By the way, after her years playing the stoic T'pol, it startles me to bits to see her crack a smile, let alone laugh

But whatever good will she'd accrued during the film evaporated with her ridiculous final 15 or so minutes on screen.Other than bringing back Johnny Rico, the thing that comes close to (but not quite) making MARAUDER watchable are the satiric elements

The FedNet just keeps on churning out those optimistic, jingoistic wartime propaganda
There are even scheduled hangings of Federation traitors broadcasted on air


You don't have to be a deep thinker to get all the not-so-veiled references to certain topical issues
Politics, religion, nationalism, the war on Iraq
Check, check, check, and check
They're delivered hammily and heavy-handedly, yes, but, here and there, they are insidiously enjoyable.To my shame, I also got a kick out of Sky Marshal Anoke, who is psychic and moonlights as a pop star


The Sky Marshal's hit "It's A Good Day to Die" can be seen in its extended version in the bonus features

Speaking of the bonus features, there are two audio commentaries, one by the writer/director Ed Neumeier and actors Casper Van Dien and Jolene Blalock, the other by Ed Neumeier again and also by the visual effects supervisor and the producer


That the cast and crew have the gall to be self-congratulatory in their comments boggles my mind a bit

But, in a weird way, props to them for being so audacious in turning a blind eye to what's really what


I guess, in their defense, what else could you expect them to say? That this movie is earth-shatteringly messed-up and you shouldn't see it? There are two featurettes: "Evolution: The Bugs of Starship Troopers 3: Marauder," focusing on the bug special effects, and "Enlist! Marauder' Mobile Infantry," the Making Of segment, spotlighting the cast.STARSHIP TROOPERS 3: MARAUDER isn't quite HENRY V

Not when the motivational speeches here go along the lines of  "You know what to do


Get in there and kill them all!" or that old chestnut "C'mon, you apes! Do you wanna live forever?" I read the Heinlein novel (Starship Troopers) and really liked it
And I thought that the first STARSHIP TROOPERS was just great, never mind that the critics panned it or that it never made huge box office duckets
Going in, I suspected MARAUDER was going to be weak, and it is
It doesn't even qualify as a guilty pleasure.And yet it's not as stinky as HERO OF THE FEDERATION, so that badge, at least, this film could wear very proudly.Irregardless, Johnny Rico rocks!

eddie murphy (who was funny in the 80s) manages the near-impossible: he makes jerry lewis seem sophisticated

now dont get me wrong; i love stupid comedy -- when its funny


murphy never convinces an iota here in the role of the HUGE professor klump

there is scads of humor to be mined in the struggles of fat people to fit into the normal world (take my word, i know about THAT) -- just recall oliver hardy's girth getting him stuck in a doorway during his attempt to escape bogeyland -- but murphy is merely contemptuous and nasty


well, contemptuous and nasty in a comedy i can accept, but it better be funny

$REVIEW.: This is a nothing of a movie. Really, I don't even know how to review it. I can only say it is the last gasp of a career that had a shockingly steep downfall. It's like a race horse that started out fast and great, but then got old and slowed down and finally died while watching what happened to The Happening happen.They called him the next Steven Spielberg when the hype for Signs was ramping up. What a joke. I wonder how he feels knowing that he crashed and burned, disappointed so many people, unknowingly lost his creative energy, and lost studio money. It must be a particularly cold feeling considering the way he virtually deified himself in The Lady in the Water, a movie that self-refutes because it has unbelievably high ambitions regarding art and the artist, and yet is so unbelievably poorly made.I apologize for this sorry joke in advance: The Happening is the question mark at the end of a sentence. And the question is, "what the hell happened to M. Night Shyamalan?"

$REVIEW.: That's all it takes to change your life forever.  Moral of the story?  When things finally start getting good in your life . . . stay off of bicycles!I'm just kidding!  You need to laugh after this movie.  It was a good romantic movie.  Realistic in it's message to all of us that you can't afford to play those "heart games" with life.  The notion that there will be time to correct the mistakes is an illusion.  Time is unmerciful. If you're fortunate enough to find someone worthy of loving in this world, you had better recognize it and act on it right then.What?  I'm a man and we don't talk like this?  Some of us do.  It's not just about that other thing.  Romance and the other thing are like peanut butter and jelly.  Both are good.  But put them together and you have something unique.  Something fantastic.  Something you can't live without.  If you like a bittersweet love story . . . Watch this one.  The story is touching.  The theme music is beautiful.  And the message is real.Skip the popcorn . . . and go make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich!

$review_text.: Star-director-writer Zach Baff's "Garden State" is a consistently engaging film although not a perfect one.  I thought when the film started off it was a little too quirky for it's own good.  It had kind of a sitcom feel to it which I found a little inappropriate for a film about a young man returning home for his mother's funeral.  The film got it's legs when Natalie Portman's character enters the fray as the epileptic love interest to Braff's psychologically damaged actor.  The chemistry between these two is palpable and unforced.  The film's main strength is when it focuses on their relationship.  Peter Sarsgaard gives an excellent performance as Braff's gravedigger buddy.  In smaller roles some older actors shine:  Ian Holm as Braff's father, Ron Liebman as a doctor, and Jean Smart as Sarsgaard's mother.  By no means a classic but I can envision this film developing a devoted cult following.

$review_text.: Robert Taylor was going on 20 years as a major male lead and {in the 1950s} on a box office roll and this 1955 movie showcases him perfectly. He portrays an poverty stricken aging "Knight Errant" who knows that his time has passed but nevertheless is going to stick to his principles of loyalty, honor, devotion to duty and bravery in the face of adversity.Picked by his ancient uncle as his emissary to judge the suitability of a French countess {lovely Kay Kendall} that he has arranged/contracted to marry  - Durward thru a series of double dealing machinations by King Louis X11 {A smug and snarky Robert Morley} runs the gaunlet of all manner of skullduggary, deceit, treachery, technolgy {gunpowder/guns versus his knightly sword} brigands and gypsies in order to get the countess away for Louis from a rival Dukes political machinations. Of course, Louis has betrayed Durward and the countess to the brigands for political reasons.R.Taylor is excellent as Durward gallant but shopworn and fully cognizant that he has become almost a parody where his loyalty, honor and devotion to duty is a signal for others to swindel and betray him - his portrayal as a insolvent "put upon" knight is a far cry from his noble portrayal of  a valiant knight in Mgm's big budget 1952 classic "Ivanhoe".Taylor plays Durward absolutely straight and his gradual adaptation to his new age "foul" environment he's stuck in, help from Kendal and a two timing gypsie and with more than a little "luck" is able to defeat the villians, save Louie's butt and gain the rich, landed countess as his bride. Director Richard Thorpe keeps the film smartly moving, the production values are outstanding and two bravera action sequences - a battle in a stable with Durward avoiding ax, pichfork and guns from a host of baddies with the countess providing a welcome last minute diversionary manuever and a battle in a bell tower with the chief baddie - both of them madly swinging from church bell rope to bell rope, bells pealing with a fire burning around them - both sequences are well conceived, executed and very entertaining.Kudos to Willfred Hyde -White as the kings barber who is the only man who the King trusts {because he shaves the king every morning with a straight edged razor} - he is properly unctuous and brazen in dealing with Louie. Robert Moreley is excellent as Louie a pilant schemer whose only ambition was to survive and eventually unite France. But this is Taylor's film and a great farewell to what he called his "iron jockstrap roles"  This is an under-rated and really excellent movie that I give 4 1/2 stars and strongly recommend.

$review_text.: I have a special affection for Van Helsing!I saw it in the cinema a week or so after breaking off what had become a rather joyless engagement. This film represented everything that I had been missing in my life prior to the break up: fun, adventure, fantasy, overindulgence, the list goes on. Van Helsing put a big goofy smile back on my face!All that aside, this is a mad, silly, overblown epic, that you are either going to love or hate. Its a bit like Hudson Hawk, you either get it or you don't. This film is homage to the old movies, not to the books of classic literature. Performances from everyone are over the top, not just ham, but great juicy ham and cheese croissants. In particular, Richard Roxburgh deserves a Hamoscar for his Dracula. It is truly a masterpiece of hysterical overacting (which Roxburgh clearly is very aware of) and worthy of some overblown Broadway musical. In fact, Van Helsing the Musical could just work!Visually, the film is an absolute treat, castles, landscapes, costumes, props, (the ladiezz), everything.Can I recommend it to you? Yes and no. Like I said, you have to get where its coming from. This is not a film to engage your brain, but a fast moving rollercoaster of spectacle. If you are up for it, then ride it!

$review_text.: This was quite a good movie, really a 3.9 star rating, just shy of four stars.  Certainly the storyline kept me involved, desiring to see how the characters might reclaim and reconcile love which had been shattered 50 years earlier in the violence and devastation of WWII.  The intertwining of the young and old generations, the cultures, and the modern-day with modern history gave this story great potential for success.  And anyone who sees the movie must admit the all-star cast and crew bring a level of talent difficult to surpass, thereby increasing the probability this one could have been a great movie.  But I think the movie failed to achieve its potential greatness because at the most fundamental level the writing wasn't great, and a weak screenplay prevented a great story from becoming a great movie.That being said, it's still a movie worth watching as I think it can - in some way - perhaps bring some understanding to our younger generations as to how personal the losses of WWII were to that generation, including the many lost loves.

$REVIEW.: Quentin Tarantino cops a little from about a million different sources, mixes in some clever (and occasionally overwritten) dialogue, about a billion ..., some standout performances from John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson (one super-bad cat!), Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis, and comes up with one of the freshest, most influential films in recent years.Travolta and Jackson play two dangerous men in black, paid killers for local kingpin Marcellus Wallace (a glowering, muttering-in-basso Ving Rhames) and they provide the film's central narrative thread.  This bantering pair weaves its way from an early morning hit that ends with a very freakish occurence to a grisly accident to a date with Wallace's lovely wife Mia (Thurman).  Told in a non-linear fashion, the story also manages to incorporate Willis as a pug fighter Wallace has ordered to take a dive (and who has other plans), a death-obsessed cabbie, a pie-loving potbelly-desiring cutie, sexual deviants, and a dance contest at a kitschy 50's-style restaurant.  And then there's the briefcase...Weirdly enough, the film amounts to a kind of hipster/mob sitcom.  Characters get themselves into outlandish situations, and a lot of the film's humor derives from their frantic dialogue as they attempt to extricate themselves.  It's full of quotable quotes, most of which I can't list here, and memorable bits by Christopher Walken, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and Harvey Keitel as Mr. Wolf, a guy who fixes problems.What's in the case?  It doesn't matter.  What matters is, like that fabled macguffin's mysterious contents, this film dazzles.  It even created a genre, and helped spawn an indie film renaissance of sorts.  Of course, we're probably all a bit weary of smart-alecs with guns popping off rounds and dialogue referencing 70s tv.  And don't worry:  "Pulp Fiction" is not nearly as violent as its reputation; for the most part, Tarantino actually cuts away from the gore and leaves a lot to the viewer's imaginations.  That in itself can be a bit off-putting for some.  For others, bite into this slab of cinema that's as meaty and tasty as a Big Kahuna burger.

$review_text.: The film is based on Czech fairy tale "Otes&aacute;nek" ("Greedy Guts")


It is a story of a loving but childless couple, Karel and Bozena whose biggest dream is to have a baby


To make his wife smile, Karel digs up a tree root and carves it to look like a human baby

So overwhelming is Bozena's wish to become a mother that by its power, the stump transforms into a living creature with enormous appetites
Very soon, the baby formula and carrot soup are not enough to feet the little monster and mysteriously, people begin to disappear."Little Otik" is similar to Svankmajer's earlier feature movies "Alice" and "Faust" but it is more plot-driven, has fewer stop-motion animation sequences that would not even begin until 40 or so minutes into the film


Another problem that has been noted by almost every viewer is that the movie is slightly (126 minutes) overlong and it drags a little toward the end
As excellent as Svankmajer is a live-action director, what makes him unique is the groundbreaking combination of both live-action and darkly-humorous, visceral, and surreal animation and I wanted to see more of it


Still, "Little Otik" is highly original, funny, dark, and sinister with first rate acting from live actors and many great scenes and effects


Young Kristina Adamcov&aacute; is especially good as Alzbetka, Karel's and Bozena's next door neighbor, precocious and very observant girl
I highly recommend "Little Otik" but I believe that the best introductions to Svankmajer are his short stop-motion and clay-motion films
The DVD includes the B/W 12 minutes long early film "Flat" (1969) - this is Svankmajer in his nightmarish best


We are in the claustrophobic apartment with the film protagonist where every object is an enemy and predator
Pay attention to the ending -"Abandon hope all ye who enter here".

$REVIEW.: The writers were unable to leave out their politics. Even though it may have cost them millions of dollars in lower sales.Prior to this movie, Superman was for: "Truth, Justice, and the American way".In this version, we get "Truth, Justice, and all that stuff".  I don't know what kind of motivation or agenda the writers, director, producers have, but I am SORELY disappointed in their cowardice in changing what an American icon Superman has been.Truth, Justice, and the American Way is not inane, it's idealistic optimism, which is exactly what Superman is.And then we get this line from Lois Lane: "The world doesn't need a Savior".You will find none of this type of dialogue in any of the  previous Superman presentations.Had they left their politics at home this would be a 4 or 5 star movie.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed Yogatopia.  I've been practicing yoga for around 6 years and have taught classes.  It's very difficult for me to find a DVD I want a unique, inspiring, and challenging practice.  Yogatopia delivers!  It starts off with a nice warm-up using cat-cow breathing and low lunges.  Then it evolves into a unique Salutation B (unique because rather than going from DD to WI to vinyasa it does three warrior variations).  After these salutations I'm already feeling very fluid and energized.  Then you go through a couple of standing series with reverse warrior, extended angle, and triangle.  The poses themselves overall are not very unique, but I love the sequencing and flow.  A few poses you will see (aside from the ones mentioned above and in no particular order) are dancer, crow, eagle, bridge, camel, side plank, reverse plank (which I love and rarely see in yoga DVDs), reverse triangle, and pyramid.Something that is unique is that she incorporates fire breathing in a few of the poses.  Also this video has one of the most soothing shavasanas I've found.  She doesn't talk the whole way through it, and the music is perfect.  Also, unlike most DVDs, she doesn't just leave you lying there but gently pulls you back.One drawback is that, like other reviewers have said, the voiceovers are WAY off.  The first few times I followed the DVD it was very frustrating, but once I got used to the practice it didn't bother me at all because I wasn't looking at the screen anyway.

 I was obsessed!  Like millions of other teenage girls, I couldn't get enough of seeing all those cute guys in their uniforms
 Not to mention Tom Cruise in the shower
 The story line was also a major reason teenage girls flocked to the theaters
 We had all seen the movie several times and knew what was going to happen, but we still left sobbing

 Timothy Hutton, Tom Cruise and Sean Penn all give excellent performances


 When this movie was released, nobody had heard of Tom Cruise or Sean Penn, so it's kind of fun to see them at the beginning of their careers before fame and scientology changed them


 I saw it for the first time in 10 years on cable the other night
 Wow, what memories


 If you haven't seen it in a while, you won't regret buying this DVD

 It's just as good today as it was 25 years ago

$REVIEW.: So many critics heaped so much praise on this movie, I came to it with high expectations. But I was very disappointed.Its idea of making a lobbyist for a tobacco consortium the "hero" of the film held promise. This could have been an opportunity to satirize a lot of the political correctness that has been surrounding the whole subject of smoking and health and big business. But I don't think that promise was even remotely fulfilled in this film.What I saw was essentially (and no doubt inadvertently) just another dreary public service ad like the ones that lamely try to convince people not to smoke. The ads on TV pander to teens with slogans like "Smoking stinks" or "Smoking isn't cool."  In this movie the clich&eacute;d message is conveyed by having anyone who ever smoked die. The Marlboro Man, played here by Sam Elliott painted in embittered wasting purple hues - dies. When our lobbyist hero needs to talk to Mr. Big of the tobacco consortium, played by Robert Duvall, our hero can't because, of course, the Duvall character has - died.  I expected a lot more of this movie than such obvious lecturing.In addition to its overall failure though, I found this movie to be made up of many little failures. It's a series of non-sequiturs, loosely cobbled together.  The disconnect starts early with the lobbyist's opening monologue when he says, "Manson kills; I talk."Later, he gets kidnapped by some unidentified group, and is plastered over with nicotine patches. He survives this assault, but his system is left so compromised, he can never again take even one puff of a cigarette without risking death. I'm not aware of any medical consequence like that. Nevertheless, when he later defies Doctors' advice and takes a puff, he does pass out with near-fatal anoxia. This and a dozen other scenes are not funny exaggeration - they are simply ridiculous, random insertions.The writer's/director's lack of any coherent vision for this film becomes plainer yet if you watch the DVD extras, such as the deleted scenes. One of these shows the lobbyist coming down the steps of the Capitol after having delivered a rousing speech on freedom of choice before a Congressional Hearing Committee. As he pauses on the Capitol Building steps, his son (about 12-years-old?) takes a cigarette out of his pocket and starts to light up. His father, glancing over in alarm, slaps the cigarette out of the boy's hand. What was supposed to be the point of this scene - that the father is a hypocrite and is willing to override any "freedom of choice" argument when it comes to HIS son who is smoking? But why would such a young boy even be carrying cigarettes to such a formal occasion in the first place and why would he choose that most public moment to flaunt his smoking habit? It doesn't make sense! But the writer/director didn't axe this scene on the basis of logic. They say in their commentary that they loved the scene, but were forced to cut it simply for reasons of pacing.The DVD commentary overall reveals how flimsy and illogical this whole project was. That commentary degenerates into what is essentially just a round of good old boy jocularity and mutual admiration. The men involved in this project congratulate each other on every point. They praise the tricky brilliance of making the blinds in one scene into the shape of enlarged cigarettes. This touch is absolutely undetectable to the viewers, and would be meaningless even if evident.Then the actors and director repeatedly laud Christopher Buckley, who wrote the book on which this script is based. I can't help but think his father William's reputation for verbal cleverness got transferred to Christopher, unjustifiably at least in the case of this film. Because really, this movie is just blowing smoke.

In fact, one could almost hear a Geiko Announcer or Toyota or some kind of car or real estate announcement at the end even though there isn't one.  The director has stated that he looks for simplicity and he got it, but it would have been very interesting if he could have pursued this idea further...  The film invites itself to expansion.  There is something interesting about this man, so oblivious to his -generic- surroundings that one house looks like the next house.  One Bedroom is reminescent of his own bedroom.  He seems just out of touch with modern reality like Tati's Mr. Hulot.  He looks for simpicity in today's supposedly complex world and finds everyone else confused.  But alas, all we have is Coming Home in three minutes...  I laughed, but not as long as I wanted to.

$review_text.: This is a fantastic movie, one of the best I've ever seen. It proves something I discovered a while ago but forgot: If a movie is great, what it's about doesn't matter at all.There's no way in the world I'd ever watch a movie about meth cookers in the Ozarks. Never. Never. Never. Not if you gave me a hundred dollars and a bucket of Original Recipe KFC would I watch a movie about meth cookers, in the Ozarks or anywhere else. Drugs bore and annoy me, and so do squalid, dysfunctional families, and that's all this movie is about. I only watched it to see what Jennifer Lawrence is like, and this seemed like the one to watch since I planned to watch only one.I'd never heard of her until a week or so ago, and from her photos online I figured she was just another of the countless dumb-as-posts bimbos (of both sexes), with armies of publicists and stylists but no more talent or intelligence than a cockroach, who have taken over the entertainment industry in the United States. I'm delighted to be proved wrong, about her. She is amazing.With not the slightest hint that she is acting, she carries this whole movie on her young shoulders and makes a squalid, stupid, barely believable story absolutely fascinating. The other actors are good but not anywhere near her league; and, although the writing, direction, and everything else are top-notch, without her this movie would hardly be worth watching. But WITH her it is the best movie I've seen in years.Whoever won the Oscar over her proves that Oscar voters are idiots (unless it was Natalie Portman, in which case it was just an unfortunate collision of great performances. You can tell I don't keep abreast of entertainment news, but I know a great movie when I see one).

$REVIEW.: If there's one film that exemplifies the true essence of a fairy tale, Jean Cocteau's 1946 masterpiece, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, is that film

The concept of "Beauty and the Beast" is as old as fiction, and while the story's ancient origins are unknown, Cocteau's film is more or less a faithful adaptation of its most popular, 18th century incarnation.Although the cutesy Disney animated feature is more famous, this French cinematic classic easily surpasses that version in, well, everything


By utilizing his unique visionary skill, Cocteau creates a hauntingly romantic, magical world that gives the effect of being awake in a dream

This is achieved through Henri Alekan's atmospheric photography, Christian Berard's ornate production design, Marcel Escoffier and Antonio Castillo's sumptuous, period costumes, and Georges Auric's magnificent music score


Jean Marais (in a great make-up job) and lovely Josette Day give poetic performances in the lead roles, with Marais also playing Beauty's handsome but greedy lover
Everything is weaved together by Cocteau's imaginative genius.The latest Blu-ray of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST from Criterion does ample justice to this exqusite film, restoring its beauty to the fullest degree


There's lots of enjoyable extras by way of two commentaries, a making of documentary, an interview with cinematographer Henri Alekan, a featurette on the film's restoration, the original trailer, and a plethora of production stills
There's also an alternate Philip Glass opera audio track which I frankly have no use for

I'm perfectly happy with the soundtrack that belongs with the film, thank you.I heartily give this excellent edition my highest recommendation.

$review_text.: This movie is now 15 years old and only sporadically shown on TV (not at all this year, as I can see, because of an outright explosion of new Christmas TV movies).  So, it is nice to have it on DVD.The plot for this movie had been filmed before, in the 1940's, with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck (titled "Remember the Night").  Pretty good back then, but a little on the dark side by modern Christmas movie standards.  This remake, makes it lighter than air, but also takes a little of the believability out of it.  However, the leads are great, and very likable, and who's to quibble.  It's a very entertaining way to spend a Christmas time evening.By the way, this plot was used again, in "Undercover Christmas" with Jamie Gertz, and Tyne Daly.  (Not yet on DVD in 2012.)

$review_text.: ROADHOUSE(1948)---Richard Widmark, Ida Lupino, Cornel Wilde, Celeste HolmThis is a very good film noir, with everyone involved turning in first-rate performances. Widmark plays the owner of the title establishment, Wilde is his childhood friend and manager of the roadhouse, and Lupino is a singer hired by Widmark to work in his joint. Widmark also nurses fantasies of having more than a "working" relationship with Lupino. Celeste Holm plays Wilde's "right-hand girl" at the roadhouse and she has a pretty thankless part as the girl who everybody takes for granted. In typical Hollywood fashion, this was the role that Holm was assigned immediately after winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in, GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT---go figure!!! This is Lupino's movie all the way---she really steals the show from her two male leads. She's tough as nails and is nobody's fool. I've always thought that Lupino was very underrated as an actress and this film is strong suppport for that argument.Anyway, after some verbal sparring and some very sexually charged exchanges, Wilde and Lupino fall in love, which does not please Widmark's character at all. The final third of the film is devoted to Widmark's reaction to the situation and his attempt to "punish" the two lovebirds. Widmark is terrific as the "nice guy turned psycho". He is in fine form as the deranged, giggling nut-job we know and love. This was one of Widmark's last roles as a mental case. A couple of years later, Widmark began to insist on being given other types of roles and began showing his versatility in 1950 in PANIC IN THE STREETS. Of course, in that same year, he played a "foaming at the mouth" racist in NO WAY OUT!!!Anyway, I digress. ROADHOUSE is a very good movie and I highly recommend it---as a noir, as a vehicle for Lupino, and for Widmark's excellent performance.

$REVIEW.: On the heels of "Saving Private Ryan", Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks co-produced this no-holds-barred HBO TV show that follows a single World War II airborne unit, Easy Company (Company E) from training to D-Day to Operation Market Garden to the Bulge to the kicking-in of the heartbreaking German concentration camps, and finally to the melancholy end of the war and, inevitably, the breaking-up of the unit as they take their first tentative steps towards becoming regular American citizens again.The show does not hold back from showing death and destruction. Characters we are just beginning to care about suddenly die. This recreates the terrible cost of friendship among the soldiers themselves.Some characters are incredibly brave. Others are cowards or incompetents. The key is to avoid cartoon depictions, and demonstrate the humanity of ordinary people placed in extraordinary circumstances. Along the way, they take to the challenges placed before them and accomplish the greatest victory in history. One is left with the inevitable truth that they have done the greatest thing in 2000 years of modern history, and a world has been saved by their deeds.

$REVIEW.: I guess those who enjoy movies from a box-seat of film-critiques find this movie superb, and I kind of get their points. It's a classic in its theme, content and emphasis on the story. But acting itself was centered on one person--the male protagonist. The female character was lacking in her skill as an actress. Also I find it annoying the way most French movies keep ranting about love. Give me a break! Love this, love that, yak yak, dreamy intellectualism and what not. I suggest you pass, unless this is a required movie for your Film 101 class.

$REVIEW.: At first I was kind of misled by the title but "Lil" was missing

 I rented the Blu Ray and I was not disappointed

I had to view it again  before returning it!  Filled with fast action and you have to watch it very carefully

 Had some great effects too!  Amanda Seyfried is at her best in this one of a kind movie
 Yes, they sneak in the fairy tale portion but it is only a minute, if that

 Since it takes place during medieval times, makes me wonder if that fairy tale was told back then.A wolf that terrorizes a small village and the people go after it, kill it, only to find others and cannot figure out where all these wolves are coming from and why they are attacking them

 This comes together in the middle of the movie and builds from there
 I enjoyed this movie!

$review_text.: Maybe because I saw 1408 in the movies, I have a much higher opinion of it than some others.  I was bowled over by John Cusack's performance.  My only complaint was that there wasn't enough of Samuel L. Jackson, who I think is one of our modern greats.  But when he's there, he's riviting - those eyes!  In the theatre, once things got rolling, there was never a moment's rest from the suspense and creeping horror.  And then, the constant wonder: was it really happening or was our friend finally just losing it for good?  I'm still not sure.I haven't seen the movie at home in any version, so I don't know how diluted the effect is.  I imagine this will be one of the movies that will make me long for a much bigger screen and expensive sound system I can't afford.

$review_text.: Absolutley Fabulous is undoubtedly one of the very, very best British sitcoms. Every episode is hilarious and it started a nation crying out &quot;sweetie darling&quot;. The pairing of Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley is priceless! These form a hilariously over the top duo who are  both in the fashion industry but do very little work and mainly leave it up to the incompentent and very dizzy Bubbles (played brilliantly by the talented Jane Horrocks) to do all the work even though she makes a shambles out of it most of the time. Theres also Saffron (perfectly played by Julia Sawalha) who is Edinas' poor, put upon daughter and comedy veteran June Whitfield as Edinas' batty mother. This is certainly a big highlight in the career of  the enormously talented writer and actress Jennifer Saunders. All of these 18 episodes are classics, made instantly memroable by its sharp, witty diaogue and magnificent comic playing. Its intersting to see Joanna Lumley escape her usual aristocratic image and play foul mouthed, chain smoking Patsy Stone. Saunders and Lumley have masterminded that essential comic delivery and timing brilliantly. It really iis impossible to select a favourite episode but could say that amongst the best are POOR (series two) when Edina and Patsy are arrested for drunk driving. One of the funniest scenes to take place in this episode is when Eddy and Pats are holding up traffic. A lady presses the car horn continually to which they jump out the car and go up to the car the lady is in and start hurling abuse at her. Classic stuff. Other excellent episodes include where they go off to Morroco to promote Edinas new business venture, Pop specs. An episode titled DoorHandle (series three) is where they travel all the way to New York in search of a new, hip, door handle for Edinas living room. FIRE is a great one when Eddy, Pats and Saffron are locked in a room together and they all reveal there darkest secrets. The quality in all three series' never once falters. A CLASSIC! HILARIOUS! A COMIC MASTERPIECE! Excellent comic playing and a hilarious, rollercoaster dialogue. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!

$review_text.: This film marks one of the high water marks of Bob Hope's illustrious film career. For the second time Hope is teamed with the beautiful and talented Paulette Goddard (why oh why isn't &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; available on video??) and the two have a wonderful screen chemistry that works wonderfully in this movie.I wont relate the details of the plot but to say that the film involves gangsters, spooky haunted houses, corpses rising from the dead,zombies,  thunder storms etc. It is an engrossing comedy/thriller from start to finish. Bob Hope has never been better with his lovable coward characterisation and the memorable quips along the way will have you laughing till your stomach hurts.The overraul look of the film is lavish and intriguing. Paramount obviously spent a fortune on the production and it shows. The spooky house on Black Island that Paulette inherits is one of the best haunted house sets ever constructed. It combined with the fog, strange animal noises really gets the chills going.Willie Best, a fine negro actor has a major role as Hope's man servant and he is wonderful in his performance with his one liners generating alot of laughs and he matches Bob Hope all the way.&quot;The Ghost Breakers&quot; is a superb spook flick which I know you will really enjoy. The VHS copy I have is really pristine so it is definately worthwhile in adding this classic to your collection. I love the Bob Hope films of the 40's and this is one of the best. Now can someone release &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; onto video? I'd truly love to see this great comedy duo of Hope and Goddard in their other famous screen teaming.

$review_text.: `Rumor Has It' has two good things in it: interesting cast including hilarious Shirley MacLaine, and Ted Griffin's curious and intriguing idea about the 'origin' of classic film `The Graduate.' For the reasons I don't know Griffin (who is attached to the film as director) left the set, and Rob Reiner took up the project. Then something happened to the film, which should be more original and intriguing. `Rumor Has It' is still cozy and charming in its own way, but is a great missed opportunity.The plot starts like a standard romantic comedy, but there is one clever twist in it; that is, Jennifer Aniston's heroine Sarah, already vaguely angst-ridden about her future, suddenly finds the `Truths' about her mother's life. Sarah comes to believe that her deceased mom was actually the model of Katherine Ross character in `The Graduate.' Charles Webb, she insists, wrote the story of Benjamin Braddock in `The Graduate' based on the real life of one Beau Burroughs, who is still living somewhere in America.Leaving behind her nice and understanding fianc&eacute;e (played by underrated Mark Ruffalo), Sarah travels to meet Beau (Kevin Costner). The consequences of their meeting should not be told here, but anyway you can tell from the miles away.Very clever and intelligent initial setting gradually turns into a middling rom-com path where so many others have already passed. It is Rob Reiner who once directed charming `When Harry Met Sally...' and we naturally expect something better or different. But sorry, no such luck here.Naturally (and deservedly) Shirley MacLaine steals every scene as the grandmother with an acid tongue. Richard Jenkins is excellent as Sarah's slightly odd father, cute Mena Suvari is cute as ever, and you even see handsome Mike Vogel. Uncredited Kathy Bates also appears (with a very strange hair), and Jennifer Aniston and Mark Raffalo are both good, the incarnation of nice, good-looking American couple, if nothing more. But Kevin Costner is a huge disappointment, who should have been the inspiration of Dustin Hoffman character in `The Graduate' but shows little of the charms of Ben of the Mike Nichols film.Oh, and the closing chapters are simply banal, throwing away any cleverness of the original idea about `The Graduate' or the life in Pasadena, and take the safest course throughout. If Shirley Maclaine had punched Costner in the face, the film would be much funnier. I expected to see something like that, but got no chance of seeing it. Just a comfortable, unoriginal, and insipid ending of `Ever After.'

$review_text.: Series 2 of Poldark is the 1790s. It's British Cornwall delightful; exquisite sets, locations, costuming & dialogue. Robin Ellis continues as Ross Poldark, and winning awards in the process. Writer, Winston Graham, gives us a sensual look at 18th century life in rural, SW England. It's no wonder the show has been considered one of the all-time great Masterpiece Theatre works. It is timeless, one you will watch repeatedly. Angharad Rees is Demelza Poldark, Jill Townsend is Elizabeth Warleggan, & Ralph Bates plays Geo. Warleggan, the villain of the series. You'll laugh at Jud (Paul Curran.)Two families become rivals in Series one and continue the same through episodes (called parts on the DVD) filled with suspense, ambition, swashbuckling action, romance, humor, heroics, historical drama, betrayal, and just about any other element of passion and emotion possible by bickering families. A saga you will enjoy, and don't overlook Series One, now discounted to a very affordable value.Series 2 is 13 parts, each almost an hour, all WITH SUBTITLES, and remarkably fine given the fact it was originally aired in 1977. BBC excellence. This second series also provides a different look at Jane Wymark (playing Morwenna) who is known for her role as Joyce Barnaby in "Midsomer Murders." She is good. Morwenna meets Drake (Kevin McNally-"Pirates of the Caribbean") & Judy Geeson is Caroline. Accolades could go on forever for cast and the story. Minimal musical background make "Poldark" seem something of a stage presentation with outlandishly sophisticated sets.Part (Episode) details:Part 1-Capt. Poldark returns from the military to find changes. Penrice Estate is now owned by George Warleggan, formerly Ross's Aunt Agatha's who yet lives there. Elizabeth, Warleggan's wife, if pregnant. Ross's wife, Demelza, causes a bit of family friction. Her 2 brothers, Drake & Sam, arrive as Methodists. Above all else, Poldark vs Warleggan hostility continues.Part 2-Damelza's expecting a child. Her brothers and their church activity causes added bad blood between the rival families. Friend, Dr. Dwight Enys is missing after his ship wrecks.Part 3-Ross continues his search for Dwight, almost loosing his life on French soil. Drake woes Morwenna who is promised to be wedded to another by Warleggan. Who will be successful?Part 4-Drake unhappily learns of Morwenna's betrothal to a fat parson. Capt Poldark makes plans to sail and help Dr. Enys escape from a French fort prison.Part 5-It's 1795 & Capt Poldark & the raiding party return from France but not all was success. Aunt Agatha is all agog over her 100th birthday plans. Some wedding plans also develop. But for whom?Part 6-Marital bliss has its ups & downs for Caroline and Morwenna. George seeks truth about Aunt Agatha's surprising words. A couple of religious leaders discover hanky-panky.Part 7-Warlaeggan runs for Parliament. Social status greatly interests Ross, Elizabeth, Vicor Ossie, and his wife's sis, Rowella.Part 8-Rowella's fling with the Vicar is fruitful. Problems among and between the WArleggans and Poldarks continues. Plenty of jealousy-with reason? Blackmail?Part 9-Rioters, mostly miners, steal corn and march singing hymns. As a Captain, Ross must help restore law but he also sympathizes with the poor. Elizabeth & Geo Warleggan have their own private battle. A delightful time seen of SawleFeast festival. Ross gets a huge offer.Part 10-There is much blight in marital bliss. Ross vs Demelza; Morwenna vs Vicar Ossie. More non-marriage conflict between Geo & Ross. A tense episode.Part 11-London society joins the Cromwellian elite for the Warleggan party extravaganza which includes an uninvited terrace meeting between Ross & Elizabeth. Oops. It's observed by a guest. Double oops. But there is an even larger tryst-OOPS.Part 12-Money, murder, love, espionage all play a roll in  relationships coming to an eruptive head. Even lives are at risk. Banking has Cornall in a whirl & Poldarks, Warleggins, and Enys are London bound. View high society in 1799 London.Part 13-(Unlucky only because it is the last of "Poldark") A duel. A death. A murder according to the law. Elizabeth seeks a doctor's remedy to pregnancy. Demelza runs home from London. What will be Morwenna's final chapter?YOU WILL LOVE THIS SAGA, SERIES ONE (16 parts) AND TWO.

$review_text.: I'm a big WW1 buff and really looked forward to this movie.Purported to be the real tale of the Lafeyette Escardrille, Americans who flew for France before 1917, it is only a disservice to those men. To look at it is very pretty and if you can overlook some flawed images, like all the Fokker triplanes being pained red, it looks good.Unfortuneatly this is where the good points end. Even without getting into the historical flaws the film rapidly become predictable, painfully so. You know who will die and can almost predict when and how an hour a head of time. A pointless love story with a french peasant is supposed to add an emotional touch but anyone familiar with a good war film knows this isn't needed. A crash in no man's land results in the feared German Army comming off more like the gang that couldn't shoot straight than the ravening Huns.The French officer is well done, but the actor can hardly turn in a bad performance even when playing opposite a CGI fire breathing lizard. The film even misses it's chance at the "Eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die" out look that developed among the real pilots on both sides as they realized the mortality rate would probably claim them long before the war ended. This was something touched on far better by the David Niven, Errol Flynn film "Dawn Patrol."Ultimately what I hated about this was not the historically flawed plot, I love Errol Flynn's films, but the unforgivably predictable altitude this falls to, all to fast.Get a parachute and save yourself.

$review_text.: While the setting of Asgard was a bit over the top perhaps, the story was good and in some places even funny. Odin is about to name the next king of Asgard, grooming both Thor and Loki to princely duties, but Loki's little prank goes awry when the Frost giants raid the treasury to try to retake the Casket of Winters. They are destroyed, and Odin is willing to dismiss it, but Thor is not, and leads a raid to Jotunheim to seek revenge, against his father's wishes. It is through Odin's intersession that the battle ends, but not amiably as King Laufy chooses to declare war on Asgard. It is in this battle that Loki learns his true heritage, that he is the son of King Laufy, discarded by Laufy, found by Odin and raised in Asgard.  . Because Thor in his arrogance, disobeyed him, he stripped him of his power and cast him from Asgard, until either he, or someone else can prove worthy to use Mjolnir,the magic hammer. Loki, in the meantime, demands to know more about how he came to be, and because Odin did not choose him to be the king, and Laufy discarded him,decides to take vengeance on both Laufey and Odin when Odin takes ill and falls into an enchanted sleep. Since Odin is asleep, Loki assumes the throne and leads the way for Laufey so that he may at last kill Odin while he is helpless. Thor on the other hand has problems of his own. Slamming into Midgard from above, he is anything but subtle. Taken to a hospital, he proves to be anything but the ideal patient and it is only through Jane Foster and her father that he manages to settle down so that he can try to find his hammer. He finds it, but so have others and SHIELD has surrounded it and taken all the scientific handiwork that Jane and her father had. It is when he fails to lift his hammer does he realize the truth. He must prove himself worthy once again or he will remain forever earthbound. This particular Thor is part of the Marvel Comics universe, but it is an interesting story in its own right and a fun romp through Marvel's version of Norse Mythology.

It's a staple in any college kid's collection and a movie whose references have seeped into young adult culture. Although it falls under the "stupid movie" category, it's very intelligently written and is a wonderful satire on both the fashion industry and Hollywood. To try to describe the plot would be difficult, other than the major premise that for hundreds of years male models have been used as professional assassins, unbeknowst to them. It's a great movie and Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson shine.

The premise is outlandish, and a great many sequences don't really make sense, but for those who enjoy some over-the-top special effects, it's worth viewing.  Just as one should never look to Hollywood for historical information, the same is true for science; Hollywood is out to sell movies, not educate the public.  So just get some popcorn, settle back, and enjoy this film for what it is.

$review_text.: I just viewed this film and was pleasantly surprised.  I am not an avid fan of film noir, but after seeing this gem, I wish to delve into the genre further.  The movie is akin to Hitchcock's "The Lady Vanishes", but exceeds it with grim tone and lighting.  The characters are brassy and fun and make for engaging entertainment.  The movie will keep you guessing until the very end and is highlighted by deft camerawork and tight angles.  The confines of shooting aboard a train (or sets that resemble one) give a claustrophobic feel to the film.  This uneasiness carries over to the viewer, making for an edge-of-your-seat enjoyment!  Remade in 1990 with starrer Gene Hackman.

$review_text.: This is a good historical family movie in the tradition of some that Walt Disney personally produced. There is action, suspense, drama and most of all heart to this story. Adam Beach is wonderful as Squanto. Squanto's encounter with the bear, his introduction to horses and his breaking of bread with the men of the Holy order are classics. I found it to be very entertaining.

$REVIEW.: Now that American culture has become so accustomed to movies that simply use formulaic ideas and contrived plot twists, this is a welcome return to the era of inventive filmaking. Being John Malkovich is great in many  aspects: it has great acting, a fresh plot, but most of all it succeeds in  the surprise factor. No, it doesn't use profane content to achieve this-  just pure bizarity! It's not completely unbound, however, and makes for a  funny and thoroughly enjoyable movie experience.Now, for those of you  who need a little peek into the plot, since you really have no idea what it  is about, I'll give away a little: A recently employed puppeteer finds a  tunnel in his new workplace that leads you into the head of John Malkovich  for 15 minutes- until you are dumped out by the side of the New Jersey  Turnpike. Sound interesting? Well, there's plenty more where that come  from.Overall, if you enjoy good movies, you must see this one! It'll  make you think, make you laugh, and it will probably make you dizzy.

$REVIEW.: Wow! O.O I think this is by far the best season of The Clone Wars


I got into this a little late

I was aware it was on TV, but never got around to tuning into it


So, I originally started the series on Netflix and bought the DVDs as they came out

It's been a wild ride, and after picking up the first season after it had been out for a while, the other seasons were picked up the week they came out

And this has to be my favorite season
The R2/3PO adventures were probably the only ones that are my least favorite, but the rest of the season is so rock solid that it is phenomenal


I got this on 10/29 and have watched it twice so far
The whole Ventress storyline, the Maul storyline, all of it is awesome

Not too much bad to say other than what I said for season 3: Where's the extras? I kind of like the whole video commentary idea, but I wish they added the artwork books like they did for seasons 1 and 2
But, other than that, live it, love it! Vive The Clone Wars!!!

$review_text.: This is a very likeable movie about the fantastic sharpshooter, Annie Oakley.  It doesn't deal much with her early life, but rather opens with the first shooting match against the world famous "Walker", who in real life was Butler.  We are treated to some delightful Wild West rodeo scenes.  And just overall the movie has a very likeable quality.  The love story is partially true and partially made up.  However, overall the basic facts are pretty accurate.  Barbara Stanwyck is a very natural choice for the lead role.  And the Chief who portrays Chief Sitting Bull is very charming as well.  This movie is suitable for family viewing and watch out, it will make you want to try out your marksmanship skills before the end!

$review_text.: "The Rules of the Game" directed by Jean Renoir, is considered one of the greatest movies of all time.  But, what makes a great movie?  I believe there are many aspects that go into a great film.  The title, plot, abstract terms, cinematic features, director, theme, actors, set design, mood and final scene all play a role in the final product."The Rules of the Game" is a story about the rules of love.  Of course there are very few set rules, which is the basis for this movie.  For example: Jurieu is in love with Christine, but she is already married to Robert; Robert loves Christine, but he is having an affair with Marras; and Marceau is in love with Madam Schumacher, but she is already married.  This carnival of love triangles continues to grow, and changes shape throughout the movie.  In the end, all the relationships are destroyed, which is due to the way those in the society interact with each other.The characters are used to represent the uncaring pleasure that seems to saturate the movie.  Robert's music boxes, as abstract terms, show how the characters can be fickle.  Just like the music box would play for whoever wants to listen, the characters would love whoever caught their interest at the time.  And, the camera seemed to follow the same method.All the cinematic features were used to pull the audience into the film.  The camera seems to flow around the characters as if it was one of them.  And, as the movie progresses, different characters gain its attention.  Renoir uses the depth of field in order to make the flow of characters, into the audiences view, seem more realistic and less conspicuous.  The depth of field is also used to balance out the scene.  For example, in the scene where Christine is explaining her relationship with Jurieu to the guests, Octave and Robert are right behind her lightening the mood.  Also, the sound was very realistic.  When there is music in the background, the audience knows where it is coming from.  There is no invisible band playing a score.The musical device is always shown.  For example, the masquerade music plays during a large portion of the chase and fight scenes.  These techniques add a sense of realism to the movie."The Rules of the Game" has a great director, Jean Renoir.  He is able to bring the movie to life.  Without his insight and talent, the film would not be as good as it is.  Renoir considered French society, "...rotten to the core."  He hoped people would realize it, and change their ways.  Renoir wanted the movie to be viewed as a real portrayal of the French society.  The only difference is, in his society no one wore any masks.  Also, he once stated that he did not follow the shooting script because his characters where always changing.  Renoir liked to be absorbed by the show, and let it dictate what should happen.  He did not create any main character, yet he uses society as a substitute.  Each person's life is a different thread, continually interwoven throughout the scenes.The actors themselves do not seem to be, in any way, special.  It is the way in which the film is made, and what it is designed for that makes the film a success.  Renoir could have chosen just about anyone to play the characters.  For example, the man who plays Robert was surprised that he was picked for the part.  In the past, he had only played villains and monsters.  For "The Rules of the Game," he became the imaginary owner of "La Coliniere.""La Coliniere" was not a set.  It was a true home, and the estate grounds were also real.  I am surprised to discover this fact.  Most houses are too small for shooting, but this one gave Renoir enough room to film with style, and to give his film a mood of its own.The mood of the film is summarized in the last scene.  Some characters, even though their issues are not resolved, stay at "La Coliniere."  This leaves the characters' lives open for more issues to come.  Reasonably similar to true life, there is no true harmony until a person is deceased.  Jurieu is the only one, which we know of, who will receive that peace.I liked the film, because it created a feeling of true real life action.  When the audience was viewing a single scene, the rest of the action did not stop.  In some movies, it seems as if the rest of the imaginary world stops, while you view a particular character.I believe, out of all the aspects that make a great movie, the director and his vision (which include the camera techniques that Renoir used) are what made this movie work.  The rest were little bonuses, which helped, but were not the cause of its success.  A movie can be told very differently from one director to another.  It is their vision that makes all the difference.  When the movie was first shown, Renoir was so controversial that someone tried to set fire to the theater.  If a person can create emotion like that from their film, it is bound to become great at some time in the future.

I bought it right here
Everyone else here stole my thunder, so I can only say what my favorite scenes are: - the opening scenes showing the train gliding through the European countryside - Celine sitting down across from Jesse and glancing at him..

twice - Their first kiss on the ferris wheel at post-sunset(VERY romantic)
- The 'telephone' conversation - Talking under the stars - Taking each others' picture - Saying goodbye
This movie contains the best goodbye kiss I've ever seen on film

When I first rented this movie, I tried to keep myself from watching it too often so that I wouldn't get tired of it
But it is really hard to get tired of this film.

$review_text.: The earliest and best H.G
Wells' adaptations is Island Of Lost Souls, based on The Island of Dr


Moreau

 After being rescued from a lifeboat by the S.S

Covena, Edward Parker ends up on an island run by the mysterious Dr
Moreau and his assistant Montgomery
 The Covena was delivering some animals, mostly dogs, for Moreau.The island also has some pretty strange natives, who are hirsute and barely human


 Fortunately, Moreau has a whip that scares them off

 Apart from Moreau, Montgomery, and M'ling the servant, there's Lota, a ravishing young girl whom Moreau introduces to Parker

 He is curious as to their interractions, as he secretly observes them.The natives also have a strange ritual


 Moreau asks them &quot;What is the law?&quot;  To which they reply &quot;Not to eat meat
 That is the law

 Are we not men?&quot;  And other replies
 The leader of the natives says of Moreau:  &quot;His is the hand that makes/His is the hand that heals/His is the house of pain.&quot;  Those who have read the book will know what's going on, but does not exactly follow it, as is the case with most future Moreau adaptations.Charles Laughton plays Moreau in a variety of shades, far from the typical mad scientist


 He's refined, reserved in speech (for the most part), and cunning


 His smile, and that weird twinkle in his eyes lends the hint to his (Laughton's) homosexuality, but his performance here demonstrates why Hollywood decided to protect him.Richard Arlen plays Parker as a bit of an uptight and conventional prude, and Leila Hyams as his fiancee Ruth is a perfect match for him.Kathleen Burke is a wonder as Lota--pity she didn't appear in that many films
 She gives a sensitive, sympathetic portrayal, speaking in a soft, child-like voice

 If I were Parker, I'd dump Ruth for Lota anyday.Bela Lugosi is barely recognizable in furry makeup as the leader of the natives, but once one sees those unmistakable eyes..


one instantly recognizes the man who lost his identity playing Dracula ad nauseum
 And whoever played the giant Ouran did so with great menace.As this was made before the Hays Code, some of the scenes and implied dialogue on the island is strong for that era
 That this was initially banned in many countries and in some parts of the U.S
is not surprising
 Pity they don't make movies like this anymore, because it stands heads over many.

$REVIEW.: Certain things should better be left alone. Like, for example, certain cult movies from the depths of the 70s such as the "Texas chainsaw massacre". Now, those who've seen the original know that it had cultdom written all over it because it had this feel to it as if it was done based on a true story. Kinda like the recent "Blair Witch project" flick but even more so.What the original didn't have was sexy babes runnin about in a hilarious scream-a-thon and a hillbilly family that wasn't scary but resembled rather the equivalent of Married with Children gone South.But lets get down to the painful details as far as this sorry remake is concerned. It'd be best if i went over a summarised list of the annoyances and nuisances in this movie:- The chainsaw wielding guy is so overused in this movie that in a perverse way it looked as if Black n Decker was doing a very advanced, cutting-edge, long commercial about its new line of products.- Not only was the chainsaw guy overused, but eventually he turns out to be a focal comedy point in the film, as he seems to be a moody fella. First he stashes his soon-to-be-victims away in his cellar (where they can have time to hatch escape plans, and practice some more screaming) and then quite whimsically he remembers that he's got'm all sweaty and waiting down there so he picks up his chainsaw and down he goes chopping up half the staircase in the process. Sounds like a parody? Yes, but the problem is it was not intended to be, or if it was, it stayed a well hidden secret from the movie creators.- The bizzaro-murdero-caniballo hillbilly family is so funny that it adds more howling laughter to be had and spoils whatever dim hopes this film had to be even remotely "scary". I know, it sounds like an intended parody again. Well, as i said above, it wasnt supposed to be.- The good guys, composed obligatorily of 2 categories: the babes, and the hunks, falls into one of the most horrendous cliches of bad horror films. That would be that according to such films the victims are always future catwalk stars. They are also (perhaps again obligatorily) surrealy dumb. Maybe this is supposed to kick some sense of justice into us as they become anatomy experiments by the chainsaw-wielding psycho? I don't know, but i have some notions about that...- The script, is, well, what script? To paraphrase a famous adage, the first casualty of a bad movie is the script. In this one here, the script is given to the chainsaw-psycho for practice BEFORE the movie gets filmed. It's all downhill from there.All in all, as remakes are rapidly becoming Hollywood's way of bailing itself out of a dire need for scripts, we're having a sad phenomenon where perfectly good movies are butchered in the search for mo'bucks. Younger audiences might not be as offended as older ones but the result is nevertheless poor, really poor.Acceptable for a night when you're snowed out and have a serious case of the flu to take care of, otherwise check out the original.

$REVIEW.: This should be regarded as a Hark Tsui film. Just a reminder, Tsui entered the Hollywood arena with &quot;Double Team&quot; starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and a few titles with Jet Li.Not that it's a earth-shattering title, but &quot;Time &amp; Tide&quot; does have its merit and I'm just going to stay on the merit.This is a story with a nice tie with the beginning and end scene that says the nature of men is good. That's nice, or nice enough. Inside this coating, is an action-packed feature film that reminds me heavily of &quot;Die Hard&quot;, actions based around elite force being bad guys, and a good guy that somehow (incredibly) negotiate around all the tight corners. For some reason, personally, I feel Tsui wants to show the movie-goers that he's a bit better than John Woo.Okay, it's an action film with a drama coating, but ultimately it has a flare of reality with Tse's character, someone silly enough to believe that a air-gun can make a difference. It's almost unfair to say this is Tsui's statement that he's better than Woo, but if you just want a lot of action-excitment, maybe you'd understand.

$REVIEW.: Of all the superhero films, I simply love the Xmen series the most. I enjoyed the first film immensely but the second film was just plain for me.  I have yet to see the Wolverine film, may be I still might. This particular film is set against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis as Charles Xavier ( James Mcavoy) is recruited by Mona Mactaggert to assemble a team of mutants to prevent World War 3. Casting is perfect and includes Kevin Bacon as the villain.The film works because all the characters are extremely unique and besides their unique skills, bring a drama and emotion to the film. X-men is first class and distinct, it not only revitalizes the genre but provides entertainment through superb background music, strong script, and direction. 4 stars. 10/25/2011

$REVIEW.: "Spetters," directed by Paul Verhoeven, tells the story of three young working-class Dutchmen who are into motorbike racing

 Their lives are all impacted by a vivacious gold-digging blonde who rolls into town with her mobile fast food stand


Before the film ends the characters' lives take some unexpected, and even shocking, twists

The film is in Dutch with subtitles."Spetters" is a remarkable film--a raw, gritty ensemble drama that is superbly acted


 The large, multigenerational cast includes familiar faces Jeroen Krabbe (as a sleazy sportscaster) and Rutger Hauer (as a racing champ idolized by the film's young characters).This film is packed full of life and energy--from a disco dancing homage to "Saturday Night Fever," to the motorbike racing scenes, and to the shockingly graphic [physical] scenes


 Also interesting is the film's exploration of religious faith and other sociological issues
The film dishes out ample servings of both humor and tragedy; the unsettling scenes of violence are offset by some moments of real sweetness and tenderness.The DVD contains a fascinating commentary track by Verhoeven

His comments offer a window not only into the making of the film, but also into 20th century Dutch society

He discusses in detail the actors, how various scenes were filmed, the challenges involved in getting the film made, the controversy the film ignited, etc
He places the film in context of his larger body of work


Often hilarious, sometimes touching, and consistently engrossing, this is a superb commentary that makes me appreciate the film even more."Spetters" is a thought-provoking and touching film that is ultimately curiously satisfying
It drips with blood, sweat, and tears; Verhoeven never flinches from showing the human condition in both its beauty and ugliness
It's a triumph of fearless, in-your-face filmmaking, and an essential entry in Verhoeven's remarkable body of work.

$review_text.: The Battle of Midway was the turning point of the US/Japan conflict in the Pacific Theater of WWII. In the early months of the war in 1942, Japanese forces were advancing rapidly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, and had even landed troops on two islands in the Aleutians (Attu and Kiska) - an actual invasion of an enemy army onto sovereign territory of the United States: the first time this had occurred since the War of 1812. In the first week of June, 1942, only 6 months after the attack on Pearl Harbor,  a carrier task force of The Imperial Japanese Navy, under the flag of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, launched an attack against the American military base on Midway, a small island only a few hundred miles to the west of Kauai. Opposing them was an American force of aircraft carriers and support ships under Admirals Chester Nimitz and Raymond Spruance. This movie tells the story of the ensuing 4-day sea battle. A few facts about the Battle of Midway: The opposing carriers were never within sight of each other - in fact their point of closest approach was about 200 miles - so that the entire engagement was fought by aircraft. Neither the American nor Japanese commanders or aircraft pilots ever knew precisely where the other side's ships were located, or when the other side had launched an aircraft sortie. The fact that American planes managed to sink four of the Japanese carriers and a heavy cruiser, while the Japanese managed to sink only one American carrier (USS Yorktown) and a destroyer (USS Hammann), was largely due to pure luck: American dive bombers happened to arrive at the Japanese task force at a point in time where most of the Japanese fighters were on-deck, being re-armed and re-fueled, so the dive bombers were practically unopposed except by anti-aircraft gun fire from the ships. In fact, the two American ship losses were not due to aircraft attacks: the Yorktown had been damaged, but was under tow, and would probably have made it back to Pearl Harbor for repairs, when she, and the USS Hammann, were torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese submarine I-168. Casualties were lopsided too: 307 American servicemen were killed, to 3,057 Japanese servicemen. The fact that this one battle eliminated 2/3 of Japan's front-line aircraft carriers effectively crippled their Naval air force projection capacity for the remainder of the war, and prevented any further attacks on Hawaii.The quality of the video capture in this movie is pretty good for a film made in 1976, but the quality of the audio track is pretty bad - the sound isn't very clear. I suspect that this may have been from too-aggressive noise reduction when the film was being digitzed to DVD. I have other movies from the 1970's on DVD and BluRay that sound much better (Blazing Saddles being one example). Surprisingly, the DVD has only one audio track: 1+1 channel &#34;surround sound&#34;. I don't know exactly how this is supposed to work, since I don't have a surround sound system, but on my laptop computer, running VLC Video Player, there is only sound on the left headphone channel. This is unnacceptable. There is no reason I can think of that this DVD should be lacking at least a regular Dolby Stereo audio track, if not full 5.1 audio. It's due to the poor audio that I give this DVD only a 3 star rating instead of four or five stars.  If there is a BluRay version of this film available, with a better audio specification, I would recommend buying that instead of this DVD.SUMMARY: A classic WWII movie with an international all-star cast, but the 1-channel audio track makes this particular DVD a bad choice, especially if you intend to watch it on a computer with headphones.  How they can call this DVD a &#34;collector's edition&#34; with such low audio quality is a mystery.

$review_text.: I must now make my anguished confession: I was one of those who let "Firefly" die. Not that my watching it when it was first broadcast 11 years ago would have saved it, but I certainly would have been one of the thousands of fans who wrote to the Fox Network and helped pay for trade industry ads in an attempt to save the show. Only just now have I watched the complete series--all 12 episodes of it--and I think it is one of the best shows in the history of television. It is witty, poignant, exciting, with a spaceship full of rich, fully realized characters played by a sterling cast. All the actors were so wonderful, in fact, that my favorite tended to be the one I was watching at the time.I like science fiction and love Westerns, and Joss Whedon's synthesis of the two genres went far beyond clever. In a mere handful of episodes, Whedon and his collaborators created a totally convincing fictional world, with consistent rules and very believable dangers. The "Making Of" documentary in this DVD set demonstrates amply the attachment the actors and crew had to the show, and to each other, as well as the disappointment bordering on abject grief they felt at the show's cancellation.I'm happy that most of "Firefly's" actors have gone on to success. But I'd much rather see Nathan Fillion as Malcolm Reynolds than as Richard Castle, and while I wouldn't give up Christina Hendricks as Joan Harris for anything, I will miss her as Saffron, the baddest bad girl in the galaxy. In any case, "Firefly" is a textbook example of a program that should have premiered on premium cable, where it would have had a chance for an audience to acclimate itself to the world of Mal Reynolds and his crew. At least I have the feature film "Serenity" to look forward to, and I can buy this DVD set, which I plan to do. But meanwhile, if Jayne Cobb decides to come after me, Vera in hand, all I will be able to say in response is, "Mea culpa."

$REVIEW.: One of the more scholarship-worthy films of the past ten years is A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.  The merits of the film do not lie in the plot, crafting or acting, but rather the happy dance of compromise by the two architects of the film, Steven Speilberg (director) and Stanley Kubrick (writer/developer).  With radically different ideas about drama, ambiguity and continuity, the marriage of these two artists seemed impossible.  But after Speilberg took over for the late Kubrick and picked up the film, A.I. became the most interesting collaboration in recent history, and to date is the most unconventional film of Speilberg and the most populist of Kubrick.The same type of compromise is at work in True Romance, a film directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun) and written by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction).  Without getting into filmmakers on the margins of Hollywood, no two creators are more different.  Disagree?  Try to find commonalities in Pulp Fiction and Top Gun.  And so, like A.I., True Romance becomes a child whose very existence speaks to the differences in the aesthetics placed on the craft of filmmaking by its two fathers.True Romance follows Clarence, a comic book store employee with a fascination for Elvis and Kung Fu, and his new bride Alabama, a former call girl who takes pride in only turning three tricks.  After they are married, Clarence goes after his wife's former pimp and comes away with a suitcase full of cocaine.  Unsure of how to unload their new score, the self proclaimed "minimum wage kids" head off to California to try to sell their product in one big transaction to a movie producer who is a friend of a friend of Clarence.  With mafiosos on their tall and the police closing in on them, the film climaxes with Taratino's favorite device, the Mexican Stand-off, with bodyguards, cops and mobsters all pointing guns at each other.A better cast has never been put together, but much of that is owed to luck, as future superstars litter the scenes in extra roles.  Made in 1993, the film features performances by Brad Pitt, Sam Jackson and James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano) all before they became Hollywood power-players.  In addition, the principle cast features solid stars like Christian Slater, Rosanna Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Michael Rappaport and Christopher Walken doing what Christopher Walken does: walk into a movie, spend five minutes on screen and create a moment that no viewer will forget.The earmarkings of Tarantino are everywhere: the long monologues, the super cool criminals and the references to Kung Fu, Elvis and comic books.  But Tony Scott creates a film from the original script that will be enjoyed by many folks turned off by Tarantino's avaunt gaurde form of directing.  The film does not contain a confusing narrative and does not end with ambiguous questions.  Rather, Scott does with this script what he does with most of his films: he makes a conventional film with a happy ending that most people will understand.  At the very least, this is a lesson in collaboration.

$REVIEW.: Like many parents, I want my kid to get a leg up on my life, so I sat my six-month old down in front of "Baby Einstein - On the Go - Riding, Sailing and Soaring", left to get a pack of smokes, and then returned 45 minutes later fully expecting a rational human being with whom I could discuss the implications of relativistic space-time on human perceptions of causality.I strolled into the playroom and casually asked my drooling tyke, "So, how do you square the idea of the universe emerging from a singularity, thereby implying a first cause, or at least, a prime event, with the later expansion of relativistic space-time and the apparent absence of an absolute reference frame?" I figured I'd toss the lad a gimme first, just to ease him into a productive dialogue. Little Albert (not his real name) just looked at me, made a squealing noise, and pumped his pudgy arms up and down. I figured he was gathering his thoughts together, so I waited several minutes for a response. Albert looked away and put several fingers in his mouth."Albert, did you hear my question?" I asked, and he turned to me, smiling and gurgling. This conversation was not going well. I pressed him for another hour, asking his opinions on a wide range of topics, sure that I would raise a subject on which he would have an opinion. Albert seemed uninterested not only in physics, but also in music, philosophy, religion, biology, history, art, current events, and even sports. Perhaps he hadn't existed long enough to form opinions, so I probed Albert's budding genius using a battery of tests instead, including the Wechlser Adult Intelligence Scale, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Rorschach, Thematic Apperception, and Bender-Gestalt. According to the results, Albert was the very opposite of a genius, and barely qualified as even conscious. I tried to contain my disappointment. Still, I was thankful that "Baby Einstein" uncovered the true lack of potential in my stunted offspring, and now I can save time and expense trying to educate a lost cause. My heart is heavy, but I am thankful I live in a community that has excellent social services and will provide Albert with the structure and care he needs to live out the rest of his life in as meaningful a way as his severely limited intellect will allow.

$review_text.: Wow. What a waste of time. I feel like I have just thrown away 2 hours of my life that I could have been doing something much more productive. Usually when good actors like Phillipe, Del Toro, and Caan come together, the finished product is one of greatness. Well, not here folks.I did not care about ONE of these characters. Not one. I never sympathized once with any of them. The criminals are stupid. I never really cared if they succeeded and got the money, or if they died in the next scene. The bodyguards of the wealthy man act like robots. Their dialogue seems forced, and, also ....robotic. Although she plays a very convincing pregnant lady, Julliette Lewis doesn't provide much. Long, pointless, dragged-out gun scenes plague the movie. Usually gun fights are cool, but I wasn't impressed. To all you reviewers who are giving this movie 5 stars...I ask, "WHY?!"  There are so many better films than this out there, with  better storylines and acting. This movie is not good. Plain and simple. And can Del Toro get any uglier? I mean how did this guy  make it in Hollywood? I guess Hollywood needs an ugly guy for roles like this. Skip this one, and don't be fooled by it's price. It's not worth it.

$REVIEW.: The Oblong Box is a good movie loosely based on the story of the same name by Edgar Allan Poe.  Honestly, it is probably my least favorite of the Price-Poe movies, but that still means that I enjoy it.  I think that Vincent Price and Christopher Lee are good in their roles, but the movie moves along a little slowly for my taste.  It is an interesting take on the story and real fans of Poe and Price will most likely enjoy it.I hadn't seen Scream and Scream Again until I purchased this DVD.  I was expecting something along the lines of Dr. Phibes or Theater of Blood.  I was a bit surprised when Price only appeared for a couple of minutes in the first hour, but he returns at the end to tie things together albeit loosely.  It did seems strange that one of the longest sections that didn't jump around between different characters involved a long car chase.  Now, I must admit that it is kind of a fun car chase, but it seemed a little long for this movie.  I really don't understand why the police wouldn't shoot the guy after he had attacked several officers, but that's just me.  It definitely has an interesting twist that I don't want to give away.  If you are watching it for Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee I have to give you a warning.  They are both brilliant in their parts, but their screen time is incredibly short.  I doubt that either movie will really scare you, but the stories are interesting enough that I recommend giving them a chance.  Everyone's tastes in movies change so these movies will appeal greatly to some and completely not interest others.

$review_text.: It's been a long time since I studied Documentary Film at University of Pennsylvania, but I recall the adage that documentaries are THE primary cinematic form, that fictitious film lay on a less elevated plane.While I don't agree with that, I feel some documentaries -- such as this warm and funny account of a co-curricular program in the five boroughs of Manhattan that took the city by storm a few years back -- simply break the mold.Imagine: 6,000 sixth and seventh graders with no ballroom dancing experience who enter a 60-school tournament which rises to an uproarious climax -- and victory for a handful of gifted students and teachers.Like the greatest documentaries about schoolchildren, this one reframes the mission of education and spurns the one-size-fits all curriculum. Writer, Amy Sewell and Director, Marilyn Agrello also allow their young students to share pearls of wisdom on relaationships between the sexes, on romance, marriage, families -- and more, conveying ulttimate respect to the kids on the way.If I could cite one thing I absolutely loved about this film, it would be  Claudia Raschke-Robinson's amazing camera. This cinematographer loves faces and allows the heartbreaking beauty of these emerging adolescents to shine through both physically and emotionally.  She understands the traumas associated with coming of age, with trying to dance for the first time, the awkwardness of locking eyes with a stranger during the first steps of the meringue.But there is much grace here and serious respect for children and pre-teens.  There is also eembedded here an homage to Latino musical tradition, much of it exported from Cuba, that deserves closer study.It questions the concept of physical fitness in public schools, and does it in a way that charms the shoes off the audience.  Would you rather do a squat-thrust or the mambo?I've seen this film twice in theatres and will watch it once or twice at home.  I have it slotted for five Christmas gifts -- most to educators and administrators, but also to a dancer I know.This is superb filmmaking -- and don't let the lala cinema purists whine about its "sentimentality" or its "formulaic" plot.  Having studied film and art history on the graduate level and produced a brrieef documentary myself, I can say that if you miss this one, you've really missed a winner.Ten stars.  No bull. And a marvelous film score, too.

$REVIEW.: Besides some classic Disney movies, the first film I really remember seeing in the theater was Star Wars.  Empire left me depressed, and I made sure I saw Jedi the day it opened in 1983.  These films were groundbreaking and breathtaking for their time.  Fast forward to the 90's, and I was somewhat depressed that a whole bunch of inferior films looked better than the Star Wars movies I had loved.Unlike some Star Wars &#34;officiandos,&#34; I LOVE the special edition versions of the film.  Although there are some gratuitous &#34;we did it because we could&#34; scenes added (I didn't like Jabba's band the first time around), the tie-ins to the 1st trilogy really make them feel like one long, epic story arc and the movies are much cleaner to view&#8212;particularly on our modern-day HD flat panel digital televisions.  These films look like they could have been made in 2007 instead of 1977, and my son, born in the new millennium, is also a child of the Force, like his father before him.

$review_text.: Harkening back to his earlier &#34;Crimes and Misdemeanors&#34; without a foil for Woody Allen himself (Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers is definitely not playing a caricature of Allen in any way). This is a story about a former amateur tennis player nameChris Wilton who almost made it big, has now moved to London to be a teacher and ends up at a very exclusive club. He soon gives lessons to a wealthy guy named Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and says all the right things (dropping comments about opera) to get invited to a family outing. There he meets Tom's sister Chloe Hewett Wilton (the always excellent Emily Mortimer) and she's immediately smitten. As are their parents Alec (Brian Cox) and Eleanor (Penelope Wilton) as Chris continues to strategically drop things into conversation (in an early scene we see Chris reading, ironically, Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky with a cheat guide and as Chloe whines to daddy Alec about whether he could help Chris get a leg up in the world, the father notes he and Chris had a really interesting conversation about Dostoyevsky). Chris is smart, savvy and step-by-step working his way into this family and their 1% world of power and wealth and boredom.And then he meets Tom's American fiance Nola (Scarlett Johansson) and becomes obsessed. The film covers most of the &#34;7 deadly sins&#34; as each character is not necessarily &#34;good&#34; and all trying to do whatever they can to get what they want. It is taught, sexy, dark and does not always go where you're expecting which is refreshing considering how many films follow a cookie cutter path.This being a co-production with BBC films and a love letter to London the cast is full of amazing UK actors in roles of varying sizes. For Doctor Who fans, you'll see multiple people who've appeared in that great series (Penelope was &#34;Harriet Jones, Prime Minister; Brian Cox was the voice of the lead Ood in &#34;The End of Time&#34; and played Sydney Newman in the anniversary tribute film &#34;An Adventure in Space & Time&#34;; etc.).So be prepared for a meditative, sexy, smoky, dark story contemplating the mean of life, the role &#34;luck&#34; plays in everything, sin and whether the choices we make have consequences and/or penalties (much like the tennis motif that leads the film) or if everything just happens from moment to moment and everyone's aggressively going after their own selfish &#34;wants&#34; with no concern for others.Where it goes might be hard for some people to watch, but it's an amazing film, well-written, acted, directed and far from the standard Woody Allen film in every way.

$REVIEW.: The reason Memento is so amazing is that it's told in reverse.  It's completely unique, a trend-setting idea.  There are small tidbits at a time, just enough to give a clue about what happened.  It's a truly amazing idea that keeps a viewer slightly off-center the entire movie.  Memento is truly ground-breaking when it comes to the movie-making aspect and story-telling style in cinema.The basic story of Memento is about revenge.  When someone wrongs someone you love, to what lengths would you go to avenge their death?  Now, throw in a slight road-block: you have no short-term memory.Leonard (Guy Pierce) wakes up unaware of anything.  The only clues he has are tattooed all over his body.  On his arms, on his chest, everywhere there is a patch of skin he has notes to himself.  The only thing he knows is that all his tattoos, and several polaroid photos, are clues towards the mystery that is his wife's rape and murder.The wide-reaching impact of short-term memory loss is immense.  A person could never go to school, learn a new language, quote a recent conversation, or visit an interesting site that was just happened upon.  And, depending on when the memory lapse hit, a person could forget something a simple as wiping after going to the bathroom.Of course, that could come in handy if someone happened to have a dreadful one night stand; they'd never have to own up to it.  Maybe they have a favorite book; each time it would be the best book ever.  Each surprise movie ending would be the same time and again (would really help when watching movies like Sixth Sense).Either way, the movie is incredibly well made, and a unique idea amidst a sea of retread garbage typically put out by major Hollywood productions.

I agree, this is Kill Bill meets Looney Tunes
Stephen Chow wrote and directed this film and I have to say that this is awesome! He is sure to be the next big martial arts star of Hollywood
The script is your typical Kung Fu story, but the fight scenes are excellent and I can't say enough and the fantastic special effects


The Lion Scream, The Buddhist Palm, I could just go on and on, this film is amazing.My personal favorite scene of the movie is when the kung fu masters fight the two assassins that play their instruments while tossing swords at their opponents

I have never seen anything like that in my life on a movie; the best part! Worth seeing the movie just for that battle sequence alone! If you love martial arts/kung fu movies this is for you!!!!

$review_text.: Merrill's Marauders is an excellent WWII movie dealing with a topic often ignored in war movies covering the Pacific Theater.  In 1944, the 5307th Composite Unit, Merrill's Marauders, 3,000 seasoned jungle fighters, march into Burma with the objective of the supply depot at Walawbum and the airfield at Myitkyina.  The Marauders must march across hundreds of miles of dense jungle, pushing themselves to their mental and physical limits, battling Japanese troops all the way.  Like most Fuller movies, Marauders has plenty of great action scenes as the 5307th trudges across Burma.  Along with the excellent battle scenes, Fuller includes several very powerful and moving scenes, specifically when the Marauders are resting in a Burmese village and are approached by the villagers.  At a compact 99 minutes, Merrill's Marauders is a quick-paced, action-packed, exciting war movie from Samuel Fuller.Jeff Chandler gives one of his best performances as Brigadier General Frank Merrill, the commander of the 5307th who must push his men to their absolute limit, physically and mentally.  Unfortunately, Chandler died before the film was released in theaters.  Ty Hardin matches Chandler with his performance as Lt. Lee Stockton, Merrill's long-time friend and leader of the 5307th's scout platoon.  Andrew Duggan plays Captain Kolodny, the doctor accompanying the unit.  Stockton's platoon includes Peter Brown as Bullseye, the platoon's sharpshooter, Claude Akins as Kolowicz, the tough sergeant, Will Hutchins as Chowhound, Charles Briggs as Muley, the mule-packer, and Pancho Magalona as Taggy, the Filipino scout.  Unfortunately, there is no DVD release of Merrill's Marauders, although this is one film that definitely deserves a release.  The VHS copy is of decent quality in pan-n-scan.  The VHS copies are getting harder to find, so if you locate one, pick it up.  Overall, Merrill's Marauders is an exciting, moving look at the invasion of Burma that has been unfairly looked over since its release.  Well worth it if you can find a copy.

$review_text.: I'm a big fan of True Blood, the HBO series, enough so that I've bought all of the DVD sets. However........Season 4 was pretty bad. I liked Eric as an amnesiac, and his relationship with Sookie (till he regained his memory).  That's about it.The other storylines rambled.  Numerous plot threads (such as Tara's career as a fighter, and a shapeshifter's impersonation of a human character's son) seemed initially interesting,  but fizzled midway through the season without connecting with the overall (muddled, rambling) story arc.  The writing was uneven, and made little sense.  The dialogue, which sparkled in the first two seasons, was frankly bad and hard to listen to, reminiscent of many poorly written sci fi channel series, in Season 4.  The vampire characters in particular were watered down and soppy.I've seen this sort of degeneration, with passing seasons, happen with other series; it's sad to see it happening with True Blood.

$review_text.: Q is a Larry Cohen movie, so b-movie fans know what to expect - a kinetic, almost documentary visual style, characters that are witty and behave like human beings, James Dixon (Cohen's Dick Miller), and little surprises to keep the movie from becoming predictable.  The basic plot has a rash of ritualistic murders linked to disappearances from rooftops in mid-town Manhattan (starting with the beheading of an Empire State Building window washer) leading to the discovery of a monster sized winged serpent.  Jimmy Quinn, a struggling former junkie/hood played beautifully by Michael Moriarty (Law & Order), stumbles across the creature's nest in the Chrysler Building (NOT the Empire State Building as some think).  After putting the creature to good use, Jimmy attempts to make a deal.  Police Officers David Carradine and Richard Roundtree are not amused.  For a bare bones disc (Q is presented in a widescreen 1:85:1 aspect ratio and that's it, no trailer, no commentary, nothing) this release is rather steep, but b-movie lovers will want it in their collection.  Recommended.

$REVIEW.: There is a scene early in "The Sum of All Fears" where Morgan Freeman's character, Bill Cabot (deputy CIA director), tells Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan (now, a young CIA turk) to "pay attention, because you are about to breath air that's way over your pay grade".  Freeman could very well have been speaking to Affleck in a real-life conversation in reference to acting.  Freeman's mere presence runs circles around Affleck's attempts to act.  Unfortunately, that is one negatives that prevents "Sum..." from being more of a landmark movie.  I struggled with the decision over whether to give this movie 3 or 4 star.  In the end, the acting deficiencies by some of main characters and some of the too-convenient plot devices, caused me to settle on 3 stars.While Affleck's acting left something to be desired, I can't be totally critical of his performance.  He really did try.  He put forth as workman-like an effort as anyone could hope for.  He just simply does not have the talent or presence to fill the formidable shoes of an action hero like Jack Ryan.  Action hero roles are proving to be a difficult type of acting.  Add to that the premise of this movie, a nuclear attack on Baltimore followed by mounting tensions between the U.S. and Russia in its aftermath, and you have a tall order for any actor to fill.  The true acting disaster in this movie belongs to Bridget Moynahan who plays his girl friend (soon-to-be wife) Cathy Muller.  Moynahan's most notable previous work was as one of the dancing waitresses in "Coyote Ugly", not exactly a stellar pedigree.  Maybe in time she will improve as an actress, but in "Sum of All Fears", Moynahan shows absolutely no acting or emotional range.  Baltimore is in ruins, her boyfriend is off risking his life to prevent a full-scale nuclear war, she has to deal with nuclear victims at her hospital and her expression would make one think she was annoyed at missing a sale at Macy's, not that she has just witnessed one of the greatest tragedies visited upon U.S. soil.Having said my piece about two the main leads, let me focus now on the rest of the movie.  The plot for "Sum of All Fears" is a very sobering one (and one that several real-life experts find to be very plausible).  With the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise to nuclear power status of many Middle East nations, it's not inconceivable that a terrorist cell could get their hands on a single nuclear weapon and transport it to the United States.  In this movie, an Israeli jet equipped with a nuclear bomb is shot down during a skirmish between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors in 1973.  Fast forward a few decades and the bomb has been unearthed by some scavengers who are unaware of its true purpose.  A group of Nazi-loyalists track down the rogue bomb and procure it for their purposes.  The purposes being destroying a major U.S. city and making it appear that Russia was behind it in order to start a full scale nuclear war between to the two nations.  In the aftermath, the Nazi's plan to use the chaos to reclaim worldwide power (at least that seems to be the plan.  It's not extraordinarily clear).  The concept of a nuclear terrorist attack is a very scary, very real scenario that hits home even harder in the aftermath of 9/11 and the discovering of an Al-Qaeda member planning to set off a radioactive 'dirty bomb'.  This situation is handled with appropriate degrees of plausibility.  The suddenness of the nuclear detonation in Baltimore combined its signature shockwaves and mushroom cloud are visions that are horrifying to view makes one hope to never have to in real life.  The reactions by the President (played ably by James Cromwell) and the rest of his cabinet seem very real and very human.  They aren't ice-cold, calm, and calculating in determining how to respond to this devastation.  They react emotionally, confused, and frustrated.  It is how one would expect leaders to react behind closed doors during such a tremendous crisis.  One would think President Bush and his advisors had moments similar to those in the movie in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.  The rising tension as one incident after another pushes the U.S. and Russia closer to nuclear war is palpable.  It's frightening to see how, for the right money and opportunity, such plans can come to fruition."Sum of All Fears" is a well-done movie and will leave the audience captivated as they watch the progression of events.  There is just a feeling, though, that this movie could have been something more with different casting choices.

$REVIEW.: As stated about Yoga Meltdown, I am not a true to form yoga fan


I took a yoga class in college and hated every second of it
It is too slow paced for me

I agree that it is a great workout, but it's not for everyone

Long story short, I picked up running in May and during these cold winter months, my flexibility has gotten bad


I asked for this DVD for Christmas

I tried out workout one today and am very thrilled to use this on my strength training days away from running.One thing I love about it is that Jillian still finds ways to implement cardio within the yoga poses
Rather than hold the pose for said amount of time, she makes you repeat the moves to help keep that heart rate up which helps burn those calories

Granted, it is not your normal yoga workout
If you are in to the tranquility of other yoga practices, this DVD might not be for you
Jillian is still loud, yelling at the camera for you to fight hard


There is nothing quiet about it


(Which is why I personally love it.)

$REVIEW.: My ultimate blu-ray wish is that Buffy be transferred to blu-ray full 1080p high definition with 5 channel lossless audio surround sound.  Like others, I would also love to see it in widescreen format, but I've heard there may be issues there (e.g., cameras, props, etc in the frame that wouldn't be seen in the 4:3 ratio but would in widescreen); however, with today's technology I am quite sure that could all be cleaned up.  Please Joss give your fans what they really want!  Would also like to see Angel released similarly.  Finally, I can't be the only one hoping that Joss is considering a full budget movie release that combines the Buffy and Angel series and brings a final closure to both series and brings Buffy and Angel together for good.  It's time to bring back Buffy, Angel, Spike, Willow, Xander, Giles, Fred, Wesley et al for one final curtain call!  Well, one can hope...

$review_text.: Michael Douglas often seems to unfairly get a bad rap; he's actually a marvelous actor--consider his superb performances in movies such as "The China Syndrome", "Fatal Attraction", "Falling Down", and "The Game", among many others, to be reminded. Douglas gives it his best shot in "Don't Say A Word" as well, playing a psychiatrist named Nathan Conrad.  Conrad's daughter Jessie (Sky McCole Bartusiak) is taken by a group of kidnappers lead by Patrick Koster (Sean Bean).  To meet Koster's request, Conrad must somehow pry a 6 digit number out of a mental patient named Elisabeth (Brittany Murphy).The key to a great thriller is its ability to really pull the viewer into its world and keep them captivated; "Don't Say A Word" comes up way short in this regard.  The movie takes itself super-seriously, and yet, there are lots of little details/ plot twists that are so far-fetched, they're eyeroll inducing.  In other words, you'll be saying to yourself "give me a break" time and time again over the course of this movie.  For one thing, the Brittany Murphy character is portrayed early on as an impenetrable, deeply disturbed patient who will "never tell" the Douglas character what he needs to know, but as the movie goes along, she alters her moods as a way of moving the story along--convenient, isn't it?--and for someone who's undoubtedly on some serious medication, this is hard to buy into."Don't Say A Word", as the saying goes, does have its moments, and it will keep you entertained throughout, largely thanks to a typically excellent and intense performance from Douglas.  Sean Bean's performance as the villian is actually pretty toothless, but Murphy does a convincing job of portraying a paranoid, frightened, and deeply disturbed mental patient, and Sky McCole Bartusiak is also commendable as the 8-year-old Jessie."Don't Say A Word" isn't a movie to go far out of your way for, but if you see the DVD real cheap in a clearance bin, it's worth picking up if you're a Douglas fan.  The bottom line is that it's good, but not great.
$SUMMARY.: far-fetched, and often laughable, but entertaining anyway

$review_text.: I'm not sure what I thought when this one was first released. Any fan of Batman knows there isn't "one Batman." I also remember that during Frank Miller's "Dark Knight" comics, in which he essentially reinvented and revitalized Bob Kane's character, there was talk floating of Clint Eastwood playing the character, which would have been AMAZING. The "Dark Knight" Batman was older, and in many ways, just as messed up as The Joker. Eastwood could have nailed it, but it never hapened."The Dark Knight" was released under the shadw of the untimely and sad passing of Heath Ledger. Ledger didn't do the campy, jovial buffoon of the late-sixties DC comics era, and he didn't do the over-the-top, scenery-chewing nutcase that Jack Nicholson portrayed in the Tim Burton film with Michael Keaton. Ledger's portrayal of the the character is based on a man who is GONE, and ain't comin' BACK.Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nothing more than a placeholder for Batman. Michael Keaton did well with the brooding, angry, insular world of the millionaire crimefighter, but Bale's Wayne lacks any true joy, charisma, joie de vivre...he's just marking time before the next time he puts on the suit.It's really Ledger's film. He's the reason to watch, he drives the plot, he has the best lines, he is the protagonist. He plays the character as if he's constantly on meds, flipping out only one time in the film (and when he does it's pretty chilling). If Cesar Romero played the role as Bozo the Clown, Ledger played it as John Wayne Gacy.It really is a decent Batman offering. I thought the first Bale film was weak, and I haven't seen the third. If you are in need of a Batman fix and you like your "Caped Crusader" dark, intense, and p*ssed off, this is the Batman film for you.

$review_text.: "The Video Show" is a collection of Genesis music videos from "Trick of the Tail" (1976), through the Phil Collins and Ray Wilson eras all the way to "The Carpet Crawlers 1999", which featured the reunited classic lineup. There's no concert footage from the Peter Gabriel era or anything (1969-1975), which is a shame. (unless you include the tiny pieces used in "The Carpet Crawlers 1999"). I'd really like to see some of that Peter Gabriel footage, and I think there is a DVD or two on amazon.com that contains some, I'll have to check them out...I'm a fan of both Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins eras (not so much Ray Wilson) and I really enjoyed the music.  The videos were an interesting look into the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, with all the various styles, budgets and locations (I love the brown urban locations in the "Keep it Dark" video). The 1970s stuff shows a bit more of their theatrical side with videos like "Robbery Assault and Battery", but its the 1980s stuff where you see a bit more of the bands personality. (The goofing around in "Invsible Touch", the concert behind the scenes of "Throwing it All Away", for instance.) There's a bit of silly character acting too, be it pretend Mexicans in "Illegal Alien", or the hypocritical televangelists in "Jesus He Knows Me" or Phil Collins slightly sleazy role as the main character in "I Can't Dance".A good deal of the videos features the guys performing on a stage or in a studio or something, which I don't really mind as it's interesting to see how they play the tunes (especially Tony Banks multi-keyboard work, my favourite one to watch him in being "Robbery Assault and Battery".) If it had been another band, these "performances" might not have been so interesting to watch.The menus of the songs are arranged like stacks of singles which you go down using the remote, which I thought was a nice touch. Don't think there are any Easter Eggs on here.  When you press the enter button just before the videos start though, you get a bit of information on each single, which is nice.Recommended for music video collectors. I think the "Land of Confusion" video clip, with it's puppets and silliness, is an essential. Benny Hill fans might also get a kick out of this, as the British comedian stars in the "Anything She Does" video as one of the Genesis tour's security guards.

$REVIEW.: Before &quot;Austin Powers&quot; there was BUCKAROO BANZAI - Poet, Doctor, Global Protector and Man-About-Town. Buckaroo made it to the 8th dimension a dozen years ago, but it took a minor miracle to get himself released on DVD - and at an affordable price at that!  IT'S WELL WORTH THE WAIT.  This is a hysterical, inspired movie that lets the audience enjoy a wild bumpy unexpected and thrilling ride (if you dare.)John Lithgow is brilliant as the hunch-backed mad scientist Lizardo.  He's a chameleon of an actor and here proves he can and will do ANYTHING to become his character.  With bad hair days  and bad teeth to boot, his Lizardo is a devilish creature you'll love!  Lithgow plays this part TO THE HILT.  Peter Geller looks great in the title role, but in his character's self-depreciating style, is regularly upstaged by Chris Lloyd and Ellen Barkin in flashier supporting roles.  Still, you can't help lovin' Buckaroo and his band of heros as they fight off the bad guys, tackle resident aliens, cure diseases, rescue entire nations, and go about their everyday humdrum Superhero lives.  Like &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; before it with its inside jokes, wild characters and odd edits, &quot;Banzai&quot; time warps, space-travels and shimmies.  Heck - the Banzai theme ALONE will keep you humming for days.  And when you least expect it, out of nowhere you'll burst out laughing thinking about a particular scene or character (and that's easy to do with names like Perfect Tommy, Penny &quot;Pretty&quot; Priddy and John Big Booty (John Big-bootaay.)Destined to always stand as a camp epic, movie-moguls and Broadway producers should consider varied versions for the masses(as in BIG BUCKAROOS). At minimum the film should have  extended run midnight show at the local cinema (like &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; ... a much needed alternative to Friday nights.)  I bet plenty of folks would enjoy experiencing Buckaroo on the big screen, since most of us missed it the first time around!Not only is this a fun family flick that withstands repeat viewings it also provokes uninhibited childish outbursts that we all need every once in awhile - especially these days.  PLUS,the DVD is chock-full of goodies that BUILD on the film experience, and tie some tangled pieces together for its audience (and trust me, you'll be confused.)  Yes, the sets are truly tacky at times, and Ed Wood-ish qualities abound.  But those exact same qualities make it that much more FUN!  In fact, as strange and as stupid as it becomes at times (and it WILL BE at first) part of the magic is letting it swallow you whole!  In the end, it may still seem stupid or inane, but I bet you'll never forget it!I'm suprised the BANZAI franchise hasn't been more deliberately marketed to new generations and audiences.  Most likely, no one can be really be expected to improve on this original and its  dishevelled work of genius.  Plus, the film's idiosyncracies and values might be doomed in an update or remake, and that would be a shame.  Think &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;.  THAT SAID, in the right hands, with its RAIDERS of the LOST ARK themes and STAR WARS shtick, I'd bet on Buckaroo!  Calling Dreamworks!  Again, the story needs repeat viewings to be enjoyed fully, but don't worry about keeping up - half the fun is not knowing exactly WHAT's going on, but experiencing it anyway.  Just listen closely and enjoy!  And remember - &quot;no matter where you go, there you are&quot;!!

Now I know rappers aren't the only ones ripping off other artists, for example, Lestat (Stuart Townsend) is ripping off Korn's lead singer, Jonathan Davis
He sounds just like him, it's amazing..

After many centuries of absorbing dust, Lestat the vampire finally decided to get out to become a rock singer? He ruined the vampire secret and exposed the world about their nature

Who cares? All of the vampires wanted him dead, except for one

Akasha (Aaliyah) wanted him to be her prince
Bad taste


She ruined the Death Valley concert to get to him (good job! terrible concert!)


There was one moment though that was memorable
The scene where Aaliyah was in a tub full of roses, it was hot! I'm sure this movie was nothing like the book, I don't know because I haven't read it


Aaliyah fans may be disappointed with the small amount of screen time Aaliyah had
It was good enough for me.

$review_text.: I was drawn to this movie from seeing the preview. It looked as if it was filled with mystical realism and an original plot. I needed to see this movie.It pulls you in with the two children, one crying on the street with her papers strewn about, the other: letting the schoolbus roll while the bus driver is helping the little girl. The students who tortured her roll down the street, screaming out of the back window. Let the game begin.They pass the tin can back and forth given to Julien by his dying mother, and the person who holds it must decide the dare. It can range from the very simple (wearing your undergarments on the OUTSIDE of your clothes) to difficult (standing on a train track with a blindfold, while a train is coming.)I enjoyed the whole idea of it. They were obsessed, with the game and with each other. The older they got, the more serious it became. Not only that, but they hurt each other, emotionally, over and over. (Hence the subject line.) If you are looking for a simple, happy love story, you are looking in the wrong place. This is dark and sad at times, with an ending that leaves you guessing.I think that the reason I scored it a little lower than the highest rating, was because once they became adults, it seemed to be the same thing over and over. One chases after the other, he/she runs away. Rinse, repeat. Unrequited love can get repetitive. I could handle the fact that both of them weren't very likeable characters. They were willing to throw everything away (and did) for each other, and this "game."Often compared to Amelie, I would say that this is similiar in style, but lacks in the "glass half full" attitude.If you are interested in deviating from the norm, I would recommend it. Just don't expect it to leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.

$REVIEW.: I've never been a fan of James Bond. Probably, because I grew up with Pierce Brosnan as 007 and he sucked. I decide to give the series another shot, not because of Bond, but rather Daniel Craig. I have been a fan of Craig's for some time, having seen several of the films from overseas. I knew then that he would be a huge action star and now he's 007. As for my first Bond movie, it was pretty good. Craig was fantastic and avoided much of the clich&eacute; Bond moments that most of us have come to loath. The film was entertaining, but also pretty predictable and much longer than it needed to be. I was also very unimpressed by the bad guys. I thought Bond villains were supposed to be classic, but these guys were rather forgettable. I'm not in love with the Bond character, but this film did open my eyes a little bit and I probably will check out Quantum of Solace in the near future.

$review_text.: The Land That Time Forgot (2009), is a modern interpretation, of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic fantasy tale, where travelers on a small boat, encounter strange circumstances during a storm, land on a small island, and encounter dinosaurs, and other travelers also trapped there, from various periods in time.There are several plots twists that keep things interesting, one involves the presence of a German WWII era submarine, and members of her crew, who considering the situation, turn out to be some very mellow sailors.  The discovery that there is oil on the island, provides a reason for the survivors to work together, to try and find a way to escape, as they set up their own refinery.A film of the same name was released in 1975, and this version has kind of a retro 70's vibe.  The feature could easily have been more harsh or violent, but things are rather subdued.  The one gunbattle that takes place, is sanitized, and no one gets hurt.  The German sailors are cooperative, instead of being hardened killers.  The special effects are not bad, and the raptors that are the main threat, are fairly well done.  Dinosaurs do chomp a couple of people, but that is the most violent thing you will see, in this lightweight adventure.C. Thomas Howell (The Hitcher), both stars and directs this feature, that has decent production values, and a fairly competent cast, that also includes Timothy Bottoms, Scott Subiono, and Darren Dalton, who also wrote the screenplay.  If you happen to see this on your cable schedule, you might what to check it out.  Although recently released on DVD, another less expensive version is also available.
$review_summary.: a so-so made for TV dinosaur movie . . .

$REVIEW.: This is a truely memorable film


 What makes it even better is that it was a WWII film but could be about the aftermath of soldiers returning home after any subsequent war.William Wyler was a master at his craft

 And he had the ability to get a great cast together
 These are A actors past their stardom and B actors that never got a chance to show what they had

 This film showcases them all.Fredric March won his second Oscar as a vetran returning home
 He adds depth and passion to his charachter.Myrna Loy once again showed us why every actor wanted her to play his spouse

 She creates her own character while adding dimensions to her husband.Four years after her first Wyler film, Mrs


Miniver, Teresa Wright showed she was no flash in the pan
 Her performace as the daughter, had a fine line to walk and she did it to perfection.B actors Dana Andrews and Virginia Mayo play the marry in haste couple


 Neither actor had a better chance to show they could handle more difficult roles.Of course the find was newcomer, Harold Russell


 This first time actor without any formal training played his role of the truest victim of war


 The soldier who came back with the loss of his arms
 He truely deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar.In the end, you will be moved by this portrait of soldiers returning home after The Great War.

$REVIEW.: The print used for the DVD transfer is bright and clear without a trace of dirt or scratches*, the best this film has looked in years or decades.  Although the slight graininess of the original 16 mm print is visible in this digital restoration, as is the slight hiss from the 37-year-old soundtrack, neither detracts from enjoyment of this classic tale of debauchery and image shifting in swinging London.  Like "Blow Up" and "Morgan!" it documents a time of endless experimentation in life and the arts, and it's fun just to revisit these old haunts in my dotage.The extras on the disc are pretty neat too: an original trailer from Warner Bros. (who had absolutely NO IDEA how to market this film), a period hagiography of Jagger full of misinformation about him, the film and the "Moooog synthesizer" [sic], and a 24-minute featurette of recent interviews.  Included are Pallenberg (who DOES show some "dirt and scratches"...), professor/producer/movie critic Colin MacCabe, 'Performance' producer Sanford Lieberson, associate producer David Cammell (brother of the late co-director Donald Cammell), editors Antony Gibbs and Frank Mazzola, cameraman Mike Molloy, Jack Nitzsche's son and Fred Weintraub from Warner Bros.  Their reminiscences and analyses are illuminating.In all it's been an arduous, unaccountably long wait but the result is pretty wonderful.  "You're going to look funny when you're 50..."* - Except for the scene under the covers, which might be by design?

$REVIEW.: Jim Carrey is Jim Carrey


He always will be this guy will never change

So why do so many people slate this movie? We currently sell it at work, and I've gone to buy it a couple of times, only to be put off by someone telling me "it's not the Jim Carrey we know & love"

HOW exactly? Is he not funny? Is he not as rubber faced as ever? Sure a couple of his more recent movies haven't got good reviews, but who's to say you won't like them as soon as you soon see them? Personally, Liar Liar & Bruce Almighty will always be my favourites


Liar Liar is hilarious.What will happen if you slip the cable guy $50? You'll get all the film channels (including the dirty ones) for free

And if you're unlucky, you'll also get a new friend


Enter the very lonely, eccentric, Jim Carrey as a loveable cable guy, who speaks with a lisp, and is desperate for a friend

He latches onto Matthew Broderick when he mistakenly asks him his name
He then discovers that Jim's character (does he ever give his REAL name? There's Chip, there's Larry - lets call him Chip) will not leave him alone
They're now friends for life.Friends for life can mean different things


It can mean supporting someone through the good times & the bad


But it can also mean phoning someone 11 times and leaving 11 messages on their machine; cutting off their cable cos they won't answer their phone; landing them in jail and being irritating
Jim does this role to perfection, pulling the funniest faces which you just can't help but smile at, playing basketball (which he can't actually PLAY!), and ab-libbing
One of the latter's examples is during the scene at Medieval Times (look out for Janeane Garofalo!) where Chip asks for Steven's (Matthew Broderick) chicken skin and then performs his Silence of the Lambs impression was all improvised

During one take, Jim asked for the chicken skin out of nowhere


After doing the "Silence of the Lambs" bit, director Ben Stiller loved it and wanted to keep it in the film even though it wasn't in the script
If you look at Matthew's face during this scene, you can tell he is cracking up


His reaction is a genuine laugh.I had no idea before watching this film that Ben Stiller was a director first, before he became an actor and churned out a million movies a year

(Even if he does include himself in this film - see if you can spot him.) Look out for Owen Wilson too, who stars as an arrogant jerk who gets him comeuppance.The movie is very funny, but the most memorable scene is Jim's outrageous performance of "Don't You Want Somebody to Love"


You'll never hear this song again, without seeing his outrageous, OTT performance


It will definitely put a smile on your face.For many people, you're either gonna love or hate this movie


If you love Jim, and hate this movie, stop reading this review

And don't even give me a negative vote
You can't call yourself a Jim Carrey film and hate this film!

She calls him Flynn after her favorite character in a book, hides him from her widowed Mom and turns him into a nanny candidate, as the poor prince has forgot his identity.Valentine's Day arrives with Flynn's memory but he hesitates only to be found out. Gwen, Zoe's mom has fallen for him and he leaves to resume his real life.  Will Prince charming return or does it turn into a tragedy?  You will just have to watch the movie to see the ending...

$REVIEW.: Monument Valley never looked as breathtakingly beautiful as it does in this exquisite, richly faceted Western, perhaps the most accomplished film in John Ford's oeuvre. Wayne gives the performance of a lifetime as the obsessed, enigmatic Ethan, while young Natalie Wood is indelible in a brief role as Debbie, the kidnapped girl caught between worlds. Ford described his ambitious masterwork as a "psychological epic," and this gut-twisting, high-lonesome tale certainly grows more nuanced with each viewing.

$REVIEW.: I never read the original books the movie was based off of, but when I rented the movie I was very much aware of the negative press that came from this so I was not sure what to expect

I wouldn't say I was pleasantly surprised with the movie, but it is definitely better than its been given credit for by mainstream media and critics

The overall story is decent, the acting is ok, and I never found myself bored at any point in the movie
What I watched didn't look like a $250 million dollar movie though, especially when compared to a movie like Avatar, that didn't even cost as much.A couple of things really hurt this movie

The first is the name

I cant understand how Disney could allow such a horrible name for a $250 million dollar movie
The name John Carter does not make people interested and was never going to get anyone to spend money at the theater


This is just stupidly obvious


I'm pretty certain that if the movie had been called Princess of Mars it would have made millions more just from that since the focus would be more on the beautiful princess than on Taylor Kitsch
The smaller issue for me is the setting


When the books were written our knowledge of astronomy was much less than it is now, so I found myself uninterested in going to the theater to watch a movie about all this life and fighting on Mars, when that's not even remotely possible


Avatar was based on a fake world so you could more easily connect to the story than John Carter, when its based on the planet next to us that we know is cold, barely has an atmosphere, and has no intelligent life.Once the movie was available to rent from home I was interested because I enjoy sci-fi, and it was definitely worth renting, but the horrible marketing for this movie really hurt it, and for some of us the unrealistic setting also detracted from the movie
It was nice in 1917 when the book was written, but just doesn't work as well in 2012
Its too bad because I think Andrew Stanton did a decent job making the movie, but I highly doubt we will ever see the sequels.John Carter is not really worth the $10+ to see in a theater, but it is worth the $3-4 to rent on a evening when you just want some decent entertainment.

Freddie and Sarah remind me of Xander Harris and Willow Rosenberg in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Freddie Prinze Jr is like Xander Harris and Sarah Michelle Gellar is like Willow Rosenberg.  Freddie and Sarah are like Jim Levinstein and Michelle Flaherty in American Pie. Freddie Prinze Jr is like Jim Levinstein and Sarah Michelle Gellar is like Michelle Flaherty.  The fight scene that Sarah Michelle Gellar had with that wrestler where she threw him off glass painted window in Scooby-Doo reminds of Buffy throwing the master off the glass painted window.

$review_text.: I have come to this series late, even my 88 year old mother had seen it on TV and loved it; so how bad is that when she beat me to it? Recently my boss watched this, and when he finished he immediately went to the Library to get the books


I knew then it MUST be good

A friend lent me his set and I watched the last one last night; truly it's such a let down when it's over


I too am in the process of buying a set of these, all 8, and will watch them repeatedly


My favorite part of this story is the interaction between Pellew and Hornblower
Pellew is terribly fond of Horatio, is basically his father figure, and their scenes together are always superb, sometimes heartrending

Robert Lindsay is wonderful as Capt

Sir Edward Pellew, and it goes without saying how believable Ioan Gruffudd is as Hornblower
It's also great to see the British when they basically 'ruled the world' and the sun didn't set on their empire

The only other series I can compare this to is "Island at War," which is also absolutely excellent
Oh, I had to laugh, someone on here mentioned their next pet would be named "Horatio." I have to confess, I had thought the exact same thing! All in all, this series is worth whatever it takes to own it.

$review_text.: It was the storyline/group that lead the change of wrestling to the point where "sports entertainment" was at it's most popular than it's been since the 1980's as what started as a hostile takeover became a revolution as you saw the infamous logo almost everywhere & the notes from the theme song are still memorable to this stay...all of this can be put into 3 letters, n.W.o.  This is WWE's second (and better) presentation discussing the history & evolution of this group with new comments from people such as Booker T, Arn Anderson, Dusty & Cody Rhodes, Bill DeMott, Diamond Dallas Page, Kevin Nash, Billy Kidman, Sean Waltman, Vince Russo, Matt Striker, Ted Dibiase, Joe Hennig, Mike Rotundo, Big Show, Lex Luger along with archival comments from Vince McMahon, Eric Bischoff, Scott Hall, Jimmy Hart, and Hulk Hogan.The documentary stars off talking about the signing of big stars from WWE to WCW such as Scott Hall & Kevin Nash going into the details of how everything went down & how the timing was just perfect before discussing how things were done to make the perception of the angle look very realistic & the reactions to the reveal of the infamous "third man" at Bash At The Beach.  The new members added to the trio were discussed such as how one man lost his purpose when Eric Bischoff joined the group followed by how the concept of their "The Following Announcement..." was created along with how everything they did looked like real chaos to the point where Cody Rhodes told the story of what his Dad told him when he saw Rey Mysterio threw into the trailer.  The popularity of the group was discussed in details about how they were anti-heroes to the point where one current WWE superstar had nWo jerseys for his baseball team, how that came about with unpredictability & realism, and how things got so huge it became it's own brand.  Issues with the group becoming so large was talked about with them adding any wrestler who had some value with Cody & Joe giving their memories on their fathers being the in the group, how it became like a real life gang backstage, how some felt it should have been more exclusive with one talent talking about how he was invited but turned it down, and how there were so many problems (such as the Souled Out PPV) that people just started to not care anymore.  Sting's role against the nWo was briefly discussed before going into the media crossover of celebrities such as Dennis Rodman & Karl Malone & Jay Leno involvement with this group with people giving their different opinions about it including one going as far as to say WCW "prostituted" themselves.  One of the biggest highlights of this presentation was discussed next in the beginning of the end of the group starting to the formation of the Wolfpac, the creative control issues, how it started to become overkill with other groups, how evil always won, Vince Russo himself discussing why nWo 2000 failed, and the WWE revival of the group before ending the documentary talking about what the legacy of the group with one person probably saying it best, "We weren't the Beatles but we were definitely Zepplin."Matches include:Scott Hall & Kevin Nash vs. Sting, Lex Luger, Randy Savage - This match was subtitled "The Hostile Takeover" as this was "The Outsiders" in-ring debut after appearing on WCW's television shows for weeks. It should also be noted that this was suppose to be a six man tag with WCW's team against Hall & Nash with a mystery partner only for Hall & Nash to go it alone & Luger being knocked out in the opening minutes making this a regular tag team match. This was a good tag team match with each man playing to their strengths (Nash's size & power, Sting & Hall's in-ring ability, Savage's unpredictability) along with Hall & Nash doing the classic "double teaming behind the referee's back" tactics various times. The ending with Hulk Hogan transforming into Hollywood Hogan & the birth of the nWo became one of the most infamous moments in wrestling history.WCW Bash At The Beach '96[nWo: Back In Black]Hollywood Hogan vs. WCW Champion Giant - Hogan's first match since revealing himself to be the third member of the nWo complete with a new look as he was starting to grow in the black beard with the red & yellow colors replaced with black & white.  The first couple of minutes into the match was a game of "cat & mouse" as Giant initially kept cutting Hogan off from coming into the ring only for Hogan to keep going to the outside whenever Giant executed an offensive move or his offense didn't work.  Giant showed he had the superior strength advantage causing Hogan to resort to dirty tactics like pulling hair to keep Giant down & the fight to the outside with both men using the ringpost before Hogan got a taste of his own medicine when Giant "hulked up" on him.  The match itself wasn't much but showcased the new heelish in-ring style of Hogan with the biggest story behind what happened after the match when the nWo definitely "left it's mark."WCW Hog Wild '96[Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Collection]The Outsiders vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat - These teams were almost mirror images of each other as they had the combination of the in-ring worker (Hall & Booker) having a bigger & stronger partner (Stevie & Nash) as Hall & Booker started out as Hall was hip tossed over the top rope at one point before Stevie Ray took a shot on the outside that caused Hall to spit at Stevie before tagging in Nash only for Stevie to take down Nash & give Hall a receipt.  Both teams showed that they had no problems bending the rules to their advantage as they used the same tactics against each other such as taking shots being the referee's back & double teaming with Sister Sherri even getting involved from time to time before she got caught by Hall & got a taste of "machismo" for her troubles.  This was the only time I recall these teams facing each other (which is a crime) as they worked well together & had a very good match.WCW Halloween Havoc '96[Allied Powers: Wresting's Greatest Tag Teams]Syxx vs. The Bounty Hunter - This was only on here to showcase the "nWo Saturday Night" concept (which Nash went into details about on the "Legends Of Wrestling" on the blu-ray) which was completely different than what you saw in regular WCW matches from the production to the nWo members themselves doing everything from the ring announcing to commentary but the in-ring action itself was nothing more than just an "enhancement" match."nWo Saturday Night" Nov. '96WCW Tag Team Champions Outsiders vs. Steiner Brothers - For those who don't already know about this event, this was the New World Order's solo PPV meaning that it was completely different than any other WCW PPV with Eric Bischoff & Ted Dibiase providing commentary, Nick Patrick refereeing every single match & a completely different look even down to the fact that only the nWo members had entrance music.  The dream match was Scott Steiner's second match back after his back injury as both teams were evenly matched & traded momentum throughout the match causing Hall & Nash to take shots on Rick behind the ref's back to get the advantage building the hot tag to Scott before all four men ended up brawling with Nick Patrick getting caught in the line of fire causing someone else to take matters into their own hands.  Both of these teams would go on to feud over the titles for the rest of the year but this was one of their best encounters in the feud.nWo Souled Out '97WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Roddy Piper - This was the rematch from their previous Starrcade encounter only with the WCW title being on the line & Piper coming straight from spending a week in the Alcatraz prison before this match.  Piper went after Hogan with a vengeance here starting in the isle breaking any rule he can from eye rakes to low blows to choking before even using a chair before taking out other nWo members at ringside.  Hogan was able to regain some control working over Piper & trying to keep him grounded before Piper was able to make his comeback but it was an unexpected presence that would not only turn the favor but also result in a new member of the New World Order but overall it was what you expect from Piper & Hogan although not as competitive as their previous match at Starrcade.SuperBrawl VIIHollywood Hogan & Dennis Rodman vs. Lex Luger & Giant - One year later after the New World Order was born, NBA star Dennis Rodman makes his WCW in-ring debut here with Randy Savage being in their corner.  The match started out with Hogan & Luger going back & forth before Rodman was eventually tagged in complete with him still wearing his bandana & sunglasses showing up Luger with an armdrag before Luger returned the favor arm dragging Rodman's sunglasses & bandana off his face & out the ring but Rodman got more serious leapfrogging & shoulder blocking Luger down before he eventually got caught by Luger & again when he tried to do it against Giant.  Hogan & Rodman worked together with double teaming including a hip toss on Giant & double clothesline while Rodman also threw some elbows in the corner before all four men were in the ring at the same time leading to a special appearance & also a "Sports Center" moment.WCW Bash At The Beach '97Death Match: Randy Savage vs. Dallas Page - After having an intense feud for over the past 6 months, their final encounter had to be held under rules where it didn't end until one man was the last man standing.  DDP came in not wearing his ring gear but jeans & t-shirt with his ribs taped as both men started the brawl on the outside with Page choking Savage with his own shirt with Savage targeting Page's ribs with stomps & kicks while also hanging DDP on the ring ropes & both men being so intense that they knocked each other out with a double lariat at one point.  DDP went outside of his usual offense pulling moves like a springboard over the top onto Savage but hit his ribs on the guardrail with Savage hitting a double axe right onto the ribs before continuing the brawling not only on the outside but destroying the stage as well & heading back to the ring where a television camera got destroyed & Elizabeth got involved too many times for one woman's taste as well.  This match was no different than their entire rivalry, intense from start to finish & even after the match too.WCW Halloween Havoc '97Hollywood Hogan vs. WCW Champion Sting - The was the rematch from controversial Starrcade the night before with Hogan being in the usual position of "challenger."  Hogan went on the offense early as he jumped Sting the moment he came into the ring followed by elbow drops & chokes before Sting was able to rebound & took the fight to the outside where Hogan was thrown into guardrails.  Both men traded momentum with the referee getting in the way resulting in a bigger controversy in regards to the World Title than we had already had going into the match but it was a better match than their Starrcade one & as a side note, this match was shown from start to finish unlike when it was originally aired."WCW Nitro" Dec. '97No Disqualification Match: WCW Champion Randy Savage vs. Hollywood Hogan - This was one of the most unique matches in the history of the not only the WCW Championship at that time but also the nWo as the group had officially split apart into two factions earlier in the night with Hogan in his own Hollywood group & Savage being in what would eventually be known as the Wolfpack while it should also be noted that Savage was coming into this match with a bad leg.  Hogan worked over Savage with punches & choking along with a chair on the outside while The Disciple got in his shots at well.  Savage was able to make a comeback such as using the weight belt but would also end up hurting himself with his bad leg with his offense allowing Hogan to work it over.  Things started to get out of hand with the no disqualification rule with various people getting involved before one unexpected person would end up being a difference maker resulting in a match that was as you would expect from these two at this stage in their career with the No DQ rule helping the match."WCW Nitro" Apr. '98WCW Tag Team Champion Sting vs. WCW Tag Team Champion Giant - For those who don't know the story behind this unique match, Sting & Giant were scheduled to face Hall & Nash for the WCW Tag Titles leading into the previous PPV of Slamboree but Giant joined nWo Hollywood the week before the match as they won the tag team titles only for Sting to not join Giant in nWo Hollywood & join the nWo Wolfpack leading to this match where the winner gets possession of both tag titles because these two were unable to work together to defend the titles.  Giant walked into the match smoking a cigarette & blew it in Sting's face leading to Sting to respond with a slap & attempting a "stick & move" offense by hitting Giant with moves like the Stinger Splash but Giant's size allowed him to block some of these attempts including Sting just bouncing off him when trying a crossbody & powering out of the Scorpion Deathlock causing Sting to resorting to dishing out extra amounts punishment to try to keep Giant down.  The match was pretty short & sweet.WCW/nWo Great American Bash '98Hollywood Hogan & Eric Bischoff vs. Dallas Page & Jay Leno - Leno made his present felt early on as he threw his drink onto Hogan & Bischoff on the outside while also taking a slap at Hogan when he was locking up with DDP with Kevin Eubanks even throwing Hogan back in the ring when he went to the outside before he was eventually the legal man against Hogan playing the game of "cat & mouse" eventually getting Hogan in an armbar & working with DDP for moves like a double clothesline.  Bischoff played the old "Bobby Heenan" role where he would only tag in whenever one of them was down with Hogan coming into save him whenever he was in trouble but we did get the eventual Leno vs. Bischoff showdown.  Seeing the names involved with this match (Bischoff & Leno), you got what you would expect with Hogan & DDP doing most of the in-ring work with Bischoff & Leno there more or less for entertainment/comedy relief (depending on your sense of humor) as it was Kevin Eubanks on the outside who got more physically involved in the match than both Leno & Bischoff.  While this was would be acceptable for a match on free TV, this match was the main event on a PPV that didn't go over well with critics both in & outside of WCW.WCW/nWo Road Wild '98War Games Match - Team nWo Wolfpack vs. Team nWo Hollywood vs. Team WCW: Kevin Nash, Sting, Lex Luger vs. Hollywood Hogan, Stevie Ray, Bret Hart vs. Dallas Page, Warrior, Roddy Piper - While this War Games match was still contested with a roofed steel cage surrounding two rings, the rules were slightly different all the previous years in that there were three "teams" & you could also win the match by pinfall as well as submission with the person getting the fall challenging WCW Champion Goldberg at Halloween Havoc.  This match told a bunch of various stories & had unique situations such as Bret & DDP starting off the match, what Stevie Ray's intentions were, Roddy Piper showing that it was truly "every man for himself", the interaction between Bret & his own teammates, and the Warrior/Hogan confrontation.  This match resembled all the previous War Games matches in recent years where the violence took a backseat to pushing the storylines going forward.WCW/nWo Fall Brawl '98No Disqualification Match: Kevin Nash vs. WCW Champion Goldberg - Goldberg's streak was at 173-0 going into this match with both men taking & countering each others offense causing them to go outside of their comfort zones like going for submissions with Goldberg's anklelock & Nash's cross armbreaker before the hits got more impactful like a punch that knocked Nash down, Nash powering Goldberg down with a clothesline, Goldberg with a spinning neckbreaker & later spinning dropkick along with a snap slam, and even Nash using the low blow.  For two guys who have been know to be very limited in the ring, they gave a good "big man" power match with the only negative being the chaotic ending...which is typical of the nWo.WCW/nWo Starrcade '98[nWo: Back In Black; Starrcade: The Essential Collection]WCW Championship Match: Bret Hart vs. Goldberg - This match was during the initial "Vince Russo" era of WCW & happened the night after Starrcade where we got that "screwjob" ending in the match between these two resulting in Bret Hart forfeiting the championship & having a rematch here to determine the true champion. Goldberg showcased early that he had the clear power advantage before both men decided on the same strategy on working on each others legs with Goldberg executing an anklelock while Bret did a figure four. The big picture though was how everything went down during the match that led to not only a champion to be determined but also "The Band Is Back Together!""WCW Nitro" Dec. '99[Best Of WCW Monday Nitro]Hollywood Hogan, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash vs. Steve Austin & The Rock - This was the in-ring returns to the WWE of Hall & Nash in 6 years while it's been 9 years for Hogan...and also to my knowledge, this was the first "official" time that just the original members of the nWo in Hogan & Hall & Nash have teamed together.  Rock was clearly distracted as he kept trying to get at Hogan every chance he had which kept giving the nWo the advantage as Hall & Nash worked him over allowing Hogan to take in & get his shots in whenever Rock was already down while using the strategy of double & triple teaming when Austin was the legal man as well.  This was more of a short teaser match for their upcoming WrestleMania X8 matches but a fun RAW main event overall & as a side note for those hardcore wrestling fans, this is the closest you'll get to a Stone Cold vs. Hulk Hogan match as they did get physical a few times."RAW" Mar. '02[nWo: Back In Black]DVD extras include moments such as Scott Hall & Kevin Nash's debuts, Roddy Piper confronting Eric Bischoff, the night after Starrcade when Hogan not only confronts Roddy Piper but someone else who keeps "dropping the ball", and the nWo's WWE debut while Blu-Ray extras include various promos from the group.  One special bonus on the Blu-Ray edition of this DVD set is the "Legends Of Wrestling" roundtable that airs on the WWE Classics On Demand channel with this discussion revolving around the New World Order group with Michael Hayes, Jim Ross, Gene Okerland, J.J. Dillion, and Kevin Nash with them showing various clips (some taken right from the "Rise & Fall Of WCW" DVD) to showcase the top discussion at hand.  Things started off with Nash discussing who the middle man was doing the negotiations between Scott Hall & Eric Bischoff going into the deals of the contract being offered such as "Sting Money" & "favored nations."  The details of some of the concept was discussed next such as if Eric Bischoff really took credit for this idea, the type of deal Hall & Nash were working under that would later benefit them, what had to be done both in-front & behind the camera to put over that the nWo was separate from WCW, what was incorporated from crossover music into their own image, and who was going to be the "third man" if Hogan didn't do it.  The discussion then turned to the idea that WCW wanted to put WWE out of business with J.J. Dillion giving a very detailed answer as to why that was never going to happen regardless of what the ratings were before Nash went into the unorganized issues he had behind the scenes such as royalties for merchandise.  How the nWo changed the business in both a positive & negative direction was up next before going into the problems within the storyline with Nash telling his story behind the infamous "finger poke of doom" & why it didn't work (although his timeline for events was WAY off).  The controversial mockery of Arn Anderson's retirement speech was talked about in detail along with the relationship between all the "Kliq" members despite being in opposite companies before going into the constantly leadership issues, lack of motivation, behind the scenes politics, the Wolfpack vs. Hollywood feud, and the legacy of the group ended the discussion.The only real fault I can say is that the documentary only went around an hour long which sucks for those buying the regular version of this set but not that big of a deal for those getting the Blu-Ray as the roundtable went into more details.  I liked the matches as they didn't reuse matches from recent DVD releases (except Bret/Goldberg but that's understandable) and put a lot of matches that were previous unreleased or so old that it's nice to see them released again (like the ones from the original nWo DVD a decade ago).  In the end, I recommend this to a fan of the nWo/WCW/"Monday Night Wars" period of wrestling but if your strictly about the matches then the regular version while those who like promos & discussion & documentaries would be better suited for the Blu-Ray edition.

I rented this because James McAvoy is brilliant in The Last King of Scotland. Well, he's brilliant here too! This guy is the real deal. Like Daniel Craig before him, McAvoy just needs a huge juicy part to become an international superstar. For the moment I'm thrilled just with his acting. Oh, and he looks damn good too. Even in a wheelchair. Bravo to one and all.

$review_text.: In many respects "Two Orphan Vampires" epitomizes the films of Jean Rollin. Its subject matter is Rollin's favorite: murderous but strangely vulnerable vampires.  His protagonists are (as usual) two girls--possibly lesbian, certainly vampiric.  Furthermore, the film's overall atmosphere, a disquieting blend of elegy and fairy tale, is typical of Rollin's work.  Nevertheless, "Two Orphan Vampires" stands out as the great director's finest masterpiece--a poetic gem whose underlying theme is nothing less than the Imagination itself.Though the film's predacious central characters, Henriette and Louise, are raised in a Catholic orphanage, thence removed to the Parisian mansion of their adoptive father--their actual home is within their own minds.  Typically adolescent, the two girls share a secret fantasy world based largely on all the forbidden literature they can borrow or pilfer--fantastic picture books, penny dreadfuls, horrific chapbooks, etc.  Absolutely Romantic, they allow their Gothic imagination to enter the real world in a quintessentially Gothic form: they practice vampirism.Who can blame them?  The normal world, as presented by Rollin, is unbearably dismal.  Initially it is symbolized by the orphanage's monotony.  At the film's close the world contracts to an indifferent, motionless swamp.  Given these prospects, along with the apparent death or slumber of God(s), Henriette and Louise declare bloody war against the status quo.  Vive L'Imagination!  Rollin's idea, expressed through his heroines' actions, couldn't be clearer: "I think I am a vampire; therefore I am a vampire."  (My apologies to Descartes.)Naturally, Henriette and Louise lack a classical vampire's superhuman powers.  Though they claim to have night-vision, they use a flashlight to read one of their fantastic books at night.  Furthermore, one of their first victims (legendary Brigitte Lahaie) observes that even their vampiric fangs are fake!  Their limitations notwithstanding, the two girls manage to bring down a number of victims, usually by well-coordinated surprise attacks.  Of course, as their vampirism springs from their inner Romanticism, their relish for blood is quite excessive.Unfortunately, as the young vampiresses' contempt for the all-too-human world becomes more pronounced, their attacks grow more audacious--which makes their defeat inevitable...Perfectly cast as the film's title characters, Mlles. Alexandra Pic and Isabelle Teboul are a joy to behold.  While each possesses a unique beauty, together they are downright sublime!  Combining youthful playfulness with a true longing for adventure; infinitely tender toward each other, while despising everyone else as something akin to sacrificial cattle: Alexandra and Isabelle are at once wonderful and malefic--perfect emblems of Romantic Imagination!  Thus they've earned a place among the greatest horror film girls--Ingrid Pitt and Soledad Miranda.  And that comparison alone indicates that "Two Orphan Vampires" is as excellent a film as "The Vampire Lovers" or "Vampyros Lesbos"--classics of the genre.

$REVIEW.: Just saw this movie on Showtime.  There was slim pickings on TV so I gave it a shot.  I liked Chris Pine from Star Trek & giggled that Elizabeth Banks is Wyldstyle in the Lego Movie.  A lot of the premise is given away before you even start watching so you kind of know where its going the whole time.  It did bring tears to my eyes at a few moments that were touching.  I would say that its not a waste of time to watch, the acting is decent and the ending makes sense, so all it all, not a bad movie.

$review_text.: The first season of Modern Family was hilarious. When I started watching season 2 though I noticed I decline in quality. Season 2 was still funny, but it was not as good as the first. Then came season three, season 3 was just awful. They were trying to be a "smart show", they kids on the show were treated like adults, and that annoys me so much! The one thing that bothers me the most is that Ed O'neil got his start as Al Bundy on Married With Children. Married with Children started the trend of family TV shows that were kind of realistic. In Married with Children Al Bundy didn't have a good relationship with his kids, his wife and he had arguments, and as a Dad today, when I watch those Married With Children marathons on TBS. I can relate to them so much! But Ed is now on a show that his original show was once spoofing. I really wouldn't recommend this if you want a show that you want to watch ALL of the episodes, because the twenty something episodes on this are the only good ones.

$review_text.: I'm in my fifties, and I use to watch The Smurfs show on TV when it was in carton version.  I loved Gargamel, but especially Azreal his cat.  The movie version looked interesting, so I bought the DVD.  The human characters were good, and the acting was good to, but the stars had to be the 6 little 7" smurfs, that stole the show.  Granted I wanted the movie to be in the medieval times as the cartoon version, but the plot was interesting.  My only disappointment, New York,  WHY New York? but, Ok I digress. Anyway won't go into plot of movie.  Gargamel, Azreal, and the Smurfs stole the whole movie for me. Exciting, had a good moral for everyone in this movie. In it's funny brought the whole family devotion and importance in to being without being preachy. Saw another whole side of Smurfet that I never knew.  I always wondered why only one female smurf for 99 male smurfs.  OH WELL, story for amother day.  Anyway watch this movie, very enjoyable and a great lead-in to a sequel that I knew was coming.  The human actors were pretty good to not well known characters, but were talented enough to carry it thru.  Will be watching the sequel when it comes to DVD soon.

$REVIEW.: These DVDs are fully utilizing UOP (User Operation Prohibited).This means that the author of the DVD is limiting what your remote control can and will do

So, with a standard DVD player you will have to endure the commercials and FBI warnings.However, if you are fortunate enough to have a DVD player where UOP's are disabled, you can skip over these annoyances.Also, this series was put together prior to president Obama canceling our return to the moon.

$review_text.: ORPHANSTARRING: Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jimmy Bennett, Aryana Engineer and CCH PounderWRITTEN BY: David Johnson and Alex MaceDIRECTED BY: Jaume Collette-SerraRated: RGenre: Horror / ThrillerRelease Date: 24 July 2009I'd be lying if I said that Orphan didn't have all the little moments you have seen a thousand times in horror flicks and thrillers. You know the ones I mean; the loud noises, the fast camera jerks and the annoying false-alarm-scares. It has them all. So why did I give it such a high rating you might ask?Because although it has all of those little tidbits that feel like fillers and has a premise that's been recycled countless times, it has much more than any of the films you are thinking of. It makes movies like The Omen and Rosemary's Baby look like Disney films in comparison. Orphan is beyond disturbing.We feel like a silent guest in the home of Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) Coleman. We feel their love for one another and the love for their children, Max and Daniel but we also sense dark secrets and an essence of mistrust as well. The family is holding it together but there have been some issues, for sure.Kate is a recovering alcoholic and has miss-carried their third child in a very late stage of pregnancy. She had a name picked out and everything. She even dedicated a patch of rare flowers that she grows indoors to the unborn child.This is obviously why things are a bit off with the family, so she and John agree to look into adopting. They've done a pretty decent job raising the two kids they already have, so it's no wonder they are fond of nine-year-old Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) when they meet her at an orphanage. It's almost hard to believe she can be just nine. She is a very talented artist, plays the piano effortlessly and insists on dressing elegantly all the time. Despite all of this, she is without a doubt creepy.As you may have guessed, at first everything is great. She gets along with the other kids, the parents love and adore her and all is well. Then things start happening. There is a close call here and a questioning concern there and then things get nasty.What sets Orphan apart from similar films of its genre, is that things don't just get bad, they get really, really bad. This kid is one disturbed little individual.Perhaps what made kids scary in movies in the past, was that they were just kids doing bad things. What makes Esther so terrifying is that she acts like an adult when she does them. She's too mature and smart for her own good and that's more horrifying.At times it's almost like she is more aware of things than the parents. I think another factor that works is the way she dresses. They could have very easily tried to make her look eerie with dark clothes and Goth makeup and have her not say anything. Instead they chose to dress her up like a little church girl, complete with ribbons in her hair and dress shoes and they gave her a huge vocabulary and a grown up sense to know things that no child should know.Another element it has that most horror films lack, is good acting. Every character is portrayed so well, it's insane.Vera Farmiga makes us feel her pain in every scene. She is an extraordinary actress and is severely underrated. It was nice to finally see her in a lead role.Peter Sarsgaard may very well be one of the best actors out there. I have seen several of his films and he has so much diversity between his characters. Here he plays denial that anything is wrong with Esther to a T and his chemistry with Farmiga is always believable.Even the other two child actors who play Max, (Aryana Engineer) and Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) did amazing jobs. They both are so convincing that they're horribly scared, you can't help but wonder if they will need therapy after making this movie.The director, (Jaume Collette-Serra) clearly has a knack for horror films, a previous film being 2005's House of Wax, which was also done very well. He keeps you on the edge of your seat and rips amazing performances out of all the actors.The third act of the film was by far the most interesting. All bets are off for predicting anything that will happen. I was shocked repeatedly and amazed by the ending. This was easily the most original ending I have seen in any film since The Sixth Sense.It's good to see that there can still be some decent horror films made. And it's reassuring as an avid horror fan, to know that good solid actors like Farmiga and Sarsgaard are interested in the material and that talented directors like Collette- Serra are behind the reins. Even mainstream icons like Michael Bay, Peter Jackson, Sam Raimi, and Martin Scorsese have been conjuring up new horror films.It will probably take several years, if ever, for anyone to see Isabelle Fuhrman as not creepy. She does for scary little kids what Anthony Hopkins did for deranged serial killers. I wonder how this role has affected her because she conveys such evil in her performance, that you are impressed and repulsed simultaneously. And I also wonder if her parents will have any trouble finding a babysitter after this.

$REVIEW.: Even though I have grandchildren plenty old enough to watch and enjoy anime -- and, in fact, I introduced them to it -- this animated version of Kiyohiko Azuma's manga series about everyday life among a group of slightly ditzy Tokyo high school girls is terrific and I can watch and greatly enjoy the silliness all by myself. I prefer the subtitled edition so I can hear what the characters are meant to sound like: Chiyo-chan, the sweet-natured ten-year-old prodigy, whose self-reliance is a little scary even to her friends, though in many ways she's like any other kid that age; Sakaki, tall and athletic, reserved and somewhat introverted, and with a thing for small, furry asnimals (alive or stuffed); Kagura, the jock whose competitive drive Sakaki doesn't really understand; Yomi, of the glasses and black stockings, who's mature and long-suffering; Tomo, manic, bossy, yet not very talented at anything, and who drives Yomi nuts; "Osaka," the transfer student saddled with that nickname, who's quiet, shy, klutzy, and a little dumb; and, of course, Ms. Yukari, the sometimes pathological English teacher who drives her best friend, Kurosawa, to distraction with her demanding self-centeredness. The artwork is nicely done, the humor swings between sly and endearingly dopey, and I've watched adults crack up over such scenes as tossing-the-vollyball and losing-the-hiccups. I've heard it said this series is about "nothing," but that's not true (any more than it was true for "Seinfeld"); it's about the day-to-day trivial things and the relationships with peers and adults that make up most of life for adolescents. A plus for me is that, given the relatively simple vocabulary and the fact that the characters generally speak at a reasonable pace (Yukari-sensei being an exception, of course), I can follow maybe fifty percent of what is said with only an occasional glance at the subtitles. That's a much better score than I manage when listening to NHK online!

$REVIEW.: G:80 wasn't the best. Most episodes sucked. It jumped the shark. It was kiddie Galactica with worse plots than Superman III and IV.But we got Adama (with a fake beard) Boomer, Boxey (now Troy), and even Starbuck showed up at the last minute. Plus Wolfman Jack!The original concept for this series was with Adama, Starbuck, Apollo, and Baltar (having been cleared of genocide and promoted to president of the Council of Twelve). But the scripts we so bad that Hatch and Benedict wanted nothing to do with the show. So ABC changed things.So if you miss the original series and are tired of Moore-Ron's version with Vipers that shoot bullets (Huh?) that takes itself too seriously, and is afraid to be campy, rewind and bit for some fun and stupidity.  If anything, buy this for the final episode "The Return of Starbuck".  G:80 was also the first BSG series to feature humanoid Cylons.But if you prefer rape and violence, watch Moore-Ron's so-called Galactica. . .if you can stay awake.

$review_text.: This film has an unusual, very sober plot line, deals with a fortune teller and ghosts, but is not a frightening movie, and it is worth seeing because it is so unusual


Zel lives in a house that has about a dozen ghosts, all dressed in white, which only she can see

She gets along nicely with the ghosts and they with her

There are essentially three kinds of ghosts: There is a set of blind musicians who play strange repetitive music throughout the film, which helps set the film's mood

There is another group of ghosts who do not seem to interact with the musicians, including a clergyman who was struck dead by lightning and a bride who hung herself with "something blue." These two spirits constantly make out with each other

There is also a man who drank rubbing alcohol and a woman so attached to carbonated drinks that she took a bath in it

The drinks killed both of them

There are also others
The third "group" is a single young girl who is very attached to Zel

She is moot, but she helps Zel perform many psychic feats, such as getting rid of a woman's headache, helping this woman talk (actually squabble) with her dead husband (a humorous interlude), and telling a gambler which horses will win races
This young girl does not interact with the other spirits, but watches them
We have no idea how the ghosts came to live in Zel's house, and neither do they know


Zel sometimes wants to be alone, so she cuts off the ghosts from entering her bedroom by pouring salt across the threshold.The relationship between the house occupants is good until the ghosts realize that at 3 AM a very bright light appears
They understand that if they enter the light, they would be free from the house


However, when they try to leave the house and enter the light, they are inflicted with enormous pain
They tell Zel that they now know that Zel is imprisoning them, and they want her to let them go.Viewers will discover where the spirits came from? How were they imprisoned? How long were they in the house? Will Zel help them leave and thereby loose her ability to use psychic powers? Who is the moot young girl? Why does she show special love to Zel?

$review_text.: I bought this at Costco today -- this is as cheap as Warner can get, four BDs in a case designed for 2 with double-height spindles. So it LOOKS like you're getting 2 Blu-ray discs, but there are four.That's it. Four discs. In a 2-disc case. Why, Warner, why??As far as BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS, all the extras from the two-disc Special Editions are here. Unfortunately, Warner couldn't care less about the quality of the transfers. Sure you can see more detail in these BD releases, but there's been no restoration. Matte lines are starting to show, and in the case of BATMAN, very clear sprocket hole wear in the master print results in the main title jumping considerably. Paired with Danny Elfman's soaring crescendo when the title appears, the crisp gold title jittering about is pretty disappointing.I only bought this for the first two (Tim Burton) films, and at Costco the price was less than the two as individual releases. So no great loss, but still another poor customer experience from Warner Bros.

$review_text.: Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine is a fine documentary, as far as the art of the documentary is concerned--good camera work, juxtapositions by montages, scene building, and even some traces of a plot--but its point of view is slanted to the point that the film loses, consciously one must admit, all sense of objectivity. Rather, the object seems to place practically all guilt for the shootings on gun ownership and the NRA. It is also determined to debunk Charlton Heston, laying on him the onus of insensitivity, and even stupidity. Moore, doubtless, is presenting his film as an indictment of the the far right and its obsession with guns, and he is honestly concerned about the violence and the carnage in this country, blaming it all not just on the mentality of some people and groups of people but on the right to own guns. It is not people but guns that kill people. While all this is abundantly documented (without actually violent scens one might expect), the film only gives superficial explanations as to the causes that produced the killings. The comparisons are given between countries with extremely low crime rates (Australia, Germany, Japan, and others) and America--comparisions overwhelmingly depressing if you are American--do little to offer insights into this horrendous gap. A documentary has to have a point of view,and this one does: I am against guns, and the NRA is the major culprit, Moore says. Yet, the documentary, meritorious as it is on a certain level, fails to offer a truly insightful and convincing reason why "we" are what we are; to say that the NRA (and Heston) share the blame for the carnage is one thing; to fully explain where the desire for gun ownership comes from is another.

$REVIEW.: You can only be horrified by this movie if you are a devout Christian
Otherwise it's a dreamy folkloric movie

 Half way into  the movie you figure out why's Howie there and what's gonna happen to him


So the finale doesn't come as a shock, but is still powerful to a certain extent.The Jesus parallels, the true meaning of sacrifice, the nature of faith, questioning the New Testament's Christ died for our sins rhetoric(or was he sacrificed in hopes of favorable crops), pagans avenging a Christian; they are all beautiful concepts.The movie lacks a feeling of suspense and mystery say like in Don't Look Now where the eerie atmosphere builds up to an unexpected finale

It is also detached in tone, so the viewer is kept at a certain distance at all times.It is definitely not a horror movie, not even a thriller or really eerie but still provides some unique moments, especially via very authentic lookingrituals and aforementioned concepts.I also read that a longer version of the movie is available which provides more psychological background on Sergeant Howie and more blasphemous footage

I thought it was nicely shot and edited considering this was directed by a first-timer(and later on butchered by the studio).You'll enjoy this if you like off-beat movies and have interest in theology and paganism


But if you are a Christian who takes the Bible literally view it at your own risk.

$review_text.: I didn't want to watch this movie to begin with, because I figured it would be exactly as it turned out
 I further groaned when one of the trailers was for the "American Pie" spinoff "Band Camp", and another called "Undeclared", which looked like it was in the same vein

 Here we go, another American sex comedy that treats sex like something to snigger over.I just also saw a very good French film called "Fresh Bait"
 It had nothing to do with "40", and in fact the lead characters turned out to be murderers
 But what stood out in the French film was the much more mature attitude the characters in general had about sex
 The French movie has a lot of nudity and some sex, but it's just part of the plot, and handled like the perfectly natural function it's supposed to be


 The actors in the French film were in their 20's, the ones in the American film were in their 40's, yet the maturity level of the characters in the French film (at least when it came to sex) was much higher than that of the Americans.We have a messed-up outlook towards sex in this country


 At one end, we have forces trying to stifle any type of sexualty in all forms of media, usually as a ploy to gain political or religious power
 At the other end, we have a huge industry that tries to get away with everything they can, usually in ways that really denigrate the subject matter.What we get are almost weekly releases of movies that treat sex in the "American Pie" vein


 Several guys in the movie will be hard up for sex, while making no effort to build a relationship first
 Women are mostly bimbos, and have their obligatory nude scenes that are done in a titillating, voyeristic manner
 Serious looks at the subject, or even plots where sex is treated as more of a positive, natural thing are few and far between."The 40-Year-Old Virgin" is different in that it shows what the "American Pie" crowd would grow into
 The men ARE more mature, but women are still objects


 Even though they are trying to de-virginize our hero, none seems to have a healthy sex life of their own

 Trying not to give too much away, the young blonde that our hero gets involved with early in the movie gets cast aside like trash when it befits the ending of the movie that we knew was coming from the first ten minutes of viewing the film.So why not one star instead of two?  There is talent in the movie


 Practically every role is well-acted

 Some of the stuff is funny

 As is a lot of "American Pie"

 I guess this was a very popular movie
 But for that part of the crowd that went to see this movie to see the "good parts", go find yourself a copy of "Fresh Bait"
 You'll get a lot more "good parts", you'll be more entertained, the people are better looking, and then you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

$REVIEW.: Firstly, i must say that this has to be the worst paced animated show I've ever watched. That is a characteristic you MUST get used to in order to enjoy this set as much as i did. Other than that, and the unchangeable fact that some of the jokes show their age...painfully, this show ranks up there with the smartest and most biting of all sitcoms. Sure this point is covered up by the rampant childish humor, but that is also the genious that was meant to be seen. A show where you must peel away the ill-contrivances to see the true core-meaning of it. It is stupid for the sake of being smart. I think that confusing point i just mentioned was the reason why this series was so short lived. People ,all to often, do not want to think about what they are watching. And since the obvious things that occur in these shows, on the face appear insipid, underneath they are genious. Jon Lovitz is a creative mastermind, (NO i am NOT Jon Lovitz....),who deserves to have his own show. And, the writers of this program worked together perfectly to deliver a show that was worthy of him. Too bad it was not worthy of network television. Actually, i guess that's a good thing.

Although I did not hang out in the Castro (I was more to be found with the riskier trashier bunch on Polk Street) I was familiar with that area and ventured there myself once in a while. I met Harvey as I was entering the evening show of the first week of the The Exorcist, he caught my eye and we got to be talking, his warmth and ability to reach out stunned me...I liked him instantly and he stayed with me for a while after I went into movie house.Mr. Dead man Walking freaked me out, I didn't know he had "this" in him...it was prefect...that slight Jewish nerdiness...the sense of conviction and the way it affected others, he was a man on a mission and you knew it right away. Personally I always thought he was the gay movement's JFK, reflecting all the hopes and dreams and sadly carrying with him the dark omens of a bygone era at the same time and a hint of tougher years to come  and as one reviewer remarked this is a film that can be enjoyed by all gay, straight and whoever finds themselves lost and wondering in between. I can relate to that.

Dumb, stupid, inane, horrific acting, bathroom humor, first grader dialog, sad, trite, pathetic.When watching it I felt I hadn't finished high school, was shopping at a walmart or had a career in middle america as a checkout clerk at a costco. Truly I've rarely had a film dumb me down enough to feel sorry for myself. Big Trouble easily made me feel sorry for everyone involved in making this. They must have known how truly miserable this film was the entire time they were making it. I believe the only other time I felt this way was watching Escape from LA, oh wait...

$review_text.: I'M YOUR SECRETARY! I'M YOUR SECRETARY! Punishingly funny. Sick, disturbing, entertainingly silly comedy. From subtle, to heavy-handed, to unpredictable.You're not sure if you want to like, hate, or pity the main characters; Mr Grey (James Spader - Stargate, The Practice, Boston Legal) or Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal - Donnie Darko, The Dark Knight). But there are some outrageous scenes that make up for the somewhat (ahem) sick sexual practices that the boss and secretary go through.Jeremy Davies (Saving Private Ryan, Solaris, Rescue Dawn), as Lee's spaced-out boyfriend Peter, lends welcomed comic relief to some pretty dark and painful scenes (pun intended).This movie is definitely not for the straight-laced; even though you've got to keep reminding yourself "It's only a movie."  Not be be taken seriously. The tomato throwing scene was priceless.

$REVIEW.: Kind of a Rashomon type tale of what happened on a dangerous planet as retold from the point of view of several different rescued characters. There is a wrap-around story of each character being drug into the clutches of malevolent, scientific interrogators. That part is the weakest in the movie. It is done in some kind of really bad computer rendering or something that just didn't work well. The more conventional animation of each vignette was not great, but alright-- way better than the wrap-around anyway. They were more serviceable.Sometimes a character can change dramatically in look, as has been observed by others. I'm guessing that's deliberate in depicting the different points of view; i.e. to show that people think of themselves and others in dissimilar fashion. I can give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard.However, the character development and storyline were just too trite to give more than an average rating.Extras on the DVD were basically other available movies. Some of them looked interesting.

$REVIEW.: I bought the DVD box set for the series, and decided that I would give this compilation movie a try. What are the results?The movie itself is ok, it's good but not perfect. Alot of the footage from the series has been modified for the movie, but there is also scenes specifically for the movie, which makes it a bit more original. The story is very different from the series, and it's ending is a bit of a shocker. Don't worry, it's not a bad ending like you'd see on most Outer Limits episodes, but it'll leave you feeling weird.The story mostly focuses on Yuji and Marlene, and pretty much rightfully so, since those are the two main characters. However, the draw back to that is that we don't see many wonderful characters that were in the series. Some roles for characters are even switched around a bit.This movie goes to at least 95 minutes. This is I think another small weakness for the movie. If there was an extra 10 to maybe 20 minutes, the movie could've played out a bit better. Like the series, it's not without some weaknesses, but they aren't overpowering.But on the plus side, you get most of the story in one setting, alot of action, and a fairly decent romance between Yuji and Marlene. Unlike the series, this movie has no fan service at all, which makes it more friendly to viewers in one way. But the violence and dark aspect of the movie go up as a result.Overall, this is a fairly decent compilation movie. Fans of Blue Gender who want to get everything about it will probably get this movie to complete their collections. I myself like Blue Gender, and getting this movie in my opinion was well worth it. However, if you see the movie first, it may seem different, and especially more so if you've seen the series first. If you're new to Blue Gender, it is mostly better to see the series first, then see the movie, even though this is one 95 minute setting. If you are unsure, rent it first if you can before you buy it.

$review_text.: Weeks away from his imminent re election Jay Billington Bulworth (Warren Beatty) hires an assassin to take him out. He has lost his faith in politics and can't bring himself to appear before his supporters and spout the same old speeches full of lies. Knowing that his time is limited Bulworth feels invincible and starts telling his version of the truth at his last few campaign stops. First up for the Senator is an all black church. He gets up to the pulpit reads the first sentence from his prepared speech and then goes hilariously off the script. What he says is both hilarious and shocking. One of the women in the crowd the beautiful Nina (Halle Berry) can't believe what she's hearing and waits for the Senator as he's leaving. Her and her two friends want to be campaign volunteers. His top advisor (a hilarious Oliver Platt) hesitantly gets their information and by the time Bulworth arrives at his next stop they are already working as valets. His next meeting is with Hollywood insiders and that ends by the Senator chastising them for wanting so much money and making so much crap. He also calls them  a bunch of Jews. Bulworth is having the time of his life but his aides are besides themselves. They go into serious crisis control and begin issuing statements about the Senator's poor mental health. Bulworth spots Nina and offers her and her friends a ride. Nina decides to take the Senator to a hip hop club. After they go through the metal detectors Nina takes off leaving Bulworth to wander around on his own. He smokes a joint, gets mistaken for George Hamilton by a bartender, and starts rapping. From this point on Beatty raps all of Bulworth's speeches. After Nina gets back her and Bulworth dance into the early morning hours when he realizes that he has to give a speech at a lunch. When a rumpled Bulworth shows up at the banquet and delivers a tirade about big oil, health insurance, and the media in a rap that he made up on the spot everyone thinks he's lost it. The raps are clever and often funny but the joke gets old quick. Beatty is brave to go all out for this role complete with hop hop clothes knowing that some people will find it an embarrassing move by an old white guy. This is the film's biggest problem. It is an uneven mix of political satire and a man's immersion into black culture that feels awkward and potentially offensive whenever the jokes don't pan out. Beatty throws a very questionable character into the mix as well. He is a homeless black man that magically appears at all of the Senator's campaign stops and mutters some gibberish to Bulworth. He's hilarious don't get me wrong but why is he here? The last act of the film is more of the same. Nina takes Bulworth to South Central where she hides him with her family. In South Central his eyes are opened to kids as young as 13 walking the streets with guns and selling drugs. Bulworth learns that they work for a neighborhood dealer named L.D. (Don Cheadle). When Bulworth confronts him he explains to the Senator that he is doing these kids a public service since no one else would take a chance on them and give them a job. He laments the lack of education in public schools and how they are underfunded and says that that is why so many kids are choosing an easy life of crime. Bulworth takes these words to heart as they appear in his next rap on his final campaign stop an interview on live T.V.. Valid points are being brought up throughout the film although the message is lost in their questionable delivery. The other distracting problem is the identity of the hit man. At several points we see a gloved hand spiking drinks or loosening balcony railings. When the real hit man is identified it doesn't add up. The ending is a major disappointment and an easy way out. Beatty even has the audacity to stage it like a political assassination of the 60's. This film has a lot that works however. Beatty and Berry have a terrific chemistry between them. This is in evidence during their hot dance in the club. Oliver Platt is so entertaining as Bulworth's top adviser who is losing his mind. Fed up and unable to cope he starts snorting coke and lashing out at the press and anyone else who questions the Senator's behavior. According to IMDB West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin and writer/director James Toback (a very close Beatty friend) did a lot of uncredited rewrites to the script which was Oscar nominated. Bulworth is a great movie that just leaves a few too many loose ends and that let's the gimmick go on a little too long.

$REVIEW.: I very much enjoy the well thought-out plots of the Special Forces Unit


The action is mostly portrayed as difficult, dirty and dangerous (as it is in reality) but sometimes I think the soldiers/actors look far too 'pretty' after the action in complete and we never see an episode when their equipment fails, guns jam, a storm knocks out communications, etc


This show could really benefit from a researcher with actual, real-life ARMY experience where the families are concerned as well


My pet peeve with this show: PLEASE, for goodness sake (!) STOP referring to ARMY installations as 'Bases&#34; - Army facilities are correctly referred to as a POST or a FORT
(Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and Marines have &#34;Bases&#34;)

$REVIEW.: I knew within the first 90 seconds (near record) that this made for TV film was going to be a ff (fast forward) genre movie. The give-away - you ask? A script that is 90% pointless fake military jargon e.g. "clear" and lots and lots of swearing. It's obvious that the script writers, actors and director have a psychological issue with how they've spent their lives in Hollywood boutiques and are overcompensating by creating toughness the easiest way they know how - let's talk tough. Besides the totally, totally unbelievable tough guy/woman acting was the single day rental fee for a helicopter and some industrial warehouse basement to provide the obligatory concrete passages and steam piping. The story was nothing more creative than the time worn plot of the military hiding an alien or devil or whatever. Finally, the prosthetic makeup infected skin and gunshots were so juvenile dumb - yawn.

$REVIEW.: 'Gargoyles' is a made-for-television movie from '72. I fell in love with this film immediately. How could anyone resist, ancient creatures thought to be nothing more than myth and legend are living in an isolated American desert region patiently breeding in the darkness of caves and caverns watching their numbers grow as they await the day to step out into the light of day and wage war against mankind as they did in aeons past. Now that's a storyline I can get into!Cornel Wilde plays the part of a university professor specializing in demonology who uncovers the gargoyle community with his daughter played by Jennifer Salt (I had a crush on her for awhile).Good, old-fashioned '70's entertainment that was able to frighten the viewer without having access to all the special effects one has come to expect today.

$review_text.: Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.The casting was perfect.  The actors really embodied their character-counterparts and brought them to life.  Jace was just as overconfident and funny in the books, and Simon was SPOT-ON! He looked and acted exactly how I pictured him in my head.  I will admit, I was sort of disappointed in Magnus - I was expecting more sparkle, but I suppose he did OK.I really appreciated that the storyline and plot was swift without feeling rushed.  Anyone who hasn't read the books would have an easy time following the story.  They didn't go as in-depth on the shadowhunter history, but they touched on all the highlights that were important to the story for everyone to understand even if they didn't read the books.I like that they sometimes went "off script" from the book sometimes.  For example, I liked the way they flipped the sequence of the poetry reading and the club.  It somehow made more sense to me that way.  I thought it was hilarious when Simon met Jace and he asked if he was the gatekeeper and alluded to the keymaster (from the original Ghostbusters movie).  I felt that it gave the movie a funny & ironic twist.Another thing I liked about going off-book-script was the whole "rat scene" that was omitted from the movie that was in the book.  I realize the importance of that part in the book, but I think the CGI execution of that would have been ridiculous, so I'm glad they didn't go through with it.There were a few things that weren't my favorite:* I didn't like that they gave away some information in this first movie that didn't come out until later books (2 & 3).  I suppose it isn't a HUGE deal, but when I was reading the books I remember thinking "OMG ! THAT'S what's wrong with Clary's mom!!!" or finding out what Valentine really did to Clary & Jace before they were born. Minor details, but they irked me nonetheless.* Magnus was kind of boring.  When he was talking to Clary at the party, I felt like he was reading the book to me.Despite that, I REALLY enjoyed the movie - even with the "twist" ending. I've heard that the City of Ashes movie has been shelved "indefinitely" because this movie hasn't been a blow-away box office hit, but I really hope they pursue filming City of Ashes.  They did a fantastic job on City of Bones and I would definitely see City of Ashes if they filmed it.

$REVIEW.: I was expecting a cross between The Aviator and The Good Shepherd -- a thrilling and epic portrayal of a great man hiding serious psychological issues, as he battles communism or racketeering behind closed doors using methods that often cross moral lines.Instead, it was a documentary about a man suppressing his homosexuality -- the FBI is just a backdrop for this romance, not a focus of the movie.Why would you take America's most controversial bureaucrat and focus on his possible homosexuality instead of his famous actions in office? There are way more interesting homosexual couples to build movies around.This movie is neither a good crime thriller like The Untouchables nor a good romance like Brokeback Mountain -- it's nothing and it will be forgotten.

$REVIEW.: Walt Disney made five television shows about Davy Crockett with Fess Parker in the title role and Buddy Ebsen as his sidekick George Russel.  You can now own all five of these television shows in two versions.  This version presents all five television shows as they were first presented on ABC in the mid-1950s.  There is also a two-movie version that combines these five television shows into two movies.  I personally prefer the Disney Treasures version.  This version also includes additional material that may be interesting to a fan of the series.  The gem of the additional material is the interview with Fess Parker.The television shows in this set are diverse in style.  The first three television episodes are "Davy Crockett - Indian Fighter," "Davy Crockett Goes to Congress," and "Davy Crockett at the Alamo."  These television shows have some basis in historical fact, though many of the things portrayed in these shows are wrong.  For example, Davy left the rifle he called "Betsy" back in Tennessee when he went to Texas.What is amazing about these television shows is the response of Americans.  Suddenly children everywhere were sporting coonskin caps and carrying replicas of muzzle-loading rifles.  It became unfashionable to be a Native American, and very fashionable to say "bar" instead of bear.Though Davy did not survive the events at the Alamo, Davy's popularity was such that Walt Disney brought Davy back in two additional television adventures, "Davy Crockett and the Keelboat Race" and "Davy Crockett and the River Pirates."  According to Walt Disney, this second set of adventures was based on stories created about Davy Crockett, who had become a legend in his own time.  The stories were more humorous than the first three, and showed an even larger-than-life version of Davy Crockett than the first three adventures.What is most remarkable about these television shows is how well they hold up.  The story of Davy Crockett is timeless.  Davy's attributes are those that form the basis of how Americans see themselves.  Self-reliance, honesty, keeping your word, and being plain-spoken remain characteristics that most Americans value.A viewer does have to forgive several things that we now regard as politically incorrect, particularly in the first part of the first movie, where Davy seems to have little regard for Native Americans.  However, in later episodes Davy clearly values his friendship with Native Americans and attempts to honor the commitments the U.S. government made to them.I allowed my children to watch these movies when they were very young.  Yes, there is some violence in these movies.  However, Davy and George Russel used violence only when there appeared to be no other reasonable way out.  Given that the era depicted in these movies was violent, I think the movies were directed and produced well.These movies are a great way to introduce your children to an era when the American ethic for honesty, hard work, and trust were formulated.  Davy Crockett was instrumental is being an example we can all follow, perhaps now more than ever.  This movie is a must for every family film library.  Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: A woman (Deborah Harry from Videodrome) is busy preparing for her roasted paperboy dinner. Said paperboy (Matthew Lawrence) comes up w/ a plan to forestall his grisly fate by telling the crazed cook some stories. In LOT 249, a college nerd (Fargo's Steve Buscemi) uses an ancient mummy to exact vengeance on his idiot tormentors (including Hannibal's Julianne Moore as well as a seemingly 12yo Christian Slater) w/ surprising results. Next, in THE CAT FROM HELL, a zillionaire (William Hickey) hires a hitman (David Johansen) to terminate the family cat. Johansen is great as the smug killer, overmatched by the ferocious feline. Finally, we have LOVER'S VOW, where an artist (James Rebar) witnesses a murder-by-hideous-gargoyle one dark night. The creature spares his life, so long as he never tells a living soul about what he has seen. Can our hero keep his trap shut, or will he blab? This one features the breathtakingly-beautiful Rae Dawn Chong! TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE is one of the better horror anthology movies. It's up there along side of CREEPSHOW, CAT'S EYE, (the original) TALES FROM THE CRYPT, TWILIGHT ZONE, and DR. TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS. DARKSIDE is certainly one of the more solid, consistent, and gory of the bunch!...

 A story of youth that learns the lessons of selfconfidence, hard work and perserverance under conditions which she did not ask for, nor for which she was prepared to face at the age it was thrust upon her
Amazing film work for the year it was produced.

$review_text.: I had heard of Howard Stern before this film came out, usually in the context of some trouble he'd got himself into through his radio show, but as I live in England, I had never heard his show. Opinions ranged from &quot;genius&quot; to &quot;drivel&quot;, but most people agreed that Stern set out to shock and most of the time succeeded. The film doesn't shock that much, but it is very funny. It is basically the story of Stern's life and career, told very much from his point of view and featuring Stern himself in the lead role. Stern makes a good job of this and is a genuinely endearing character. He retains the audience's sympathy even when he is seen to treat his wife badly, but especially when he faces the crass radio bosses who don't understand his humour. For authenticity, Stern's co-peroformers in the radio show play themselves, and Robin Quivers shows herself to be a good actress as well as a professional radio host.

$REVIEW.: This is a movie about revenge.  It's about the quest of one man, Taw Jackson (Wayne), to get even with the man who set him up and stole his ranch.  To get his vengeance, Taw puts together a small group of men, including a gunfighter who's been hired to kill him (Douglas), to help him rob the "War Wagon," so named because it is an iron stagecoach complete with a gattling gun and a large complement of mounted guards.  The five men scheme, plan, and concoct a plan to steal the wagon, and Taw and Lomax (Douglas) try to refrain from killing each other in the process.This is not meant to be a completely serious Western, and in fact it is quite lighthearted.  It is also funny, with just enough comic relief to keep things lively.  Douglas and Wayne are absolutely fabulous together, and the rest of the cast works well too.  This is a great all-around Western.

$REVIEW.: Winner of the best director award in the Cannes film festival in 1978, and seen as a companion film to "In the Realm of the Senses", Nagisa Oshima's "Empire of Passion" is based on the book by Toko Nakamura and produced in France. At first look, the film looks a like your run-of-the-mill Japanese horror film in the tradition of "Onibaba" and "Kwaidan",  but "Empire of Passion" is much more. It is an erotic melodrama that uses horror elements, and has very strong commentary about desire, sexual independence, fallen women, social relations and political resistance.Japan 1895, in a small Japanese village, a comely woman named Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is married to a rickshaw driver named Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). Seki is a lot older than she looks, she barely looks 30, and is only a few years younger than her husband; they have two kids and although they lead a hard life, they seem content. Her youthful features make her the apple of the eyes of an ex-soldier named Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji). The two develop a friendship, often flirting, until Toyoji forces himself on Seki. Seki tries to fight him off but eventually gives in, and the two begin a forbidden affair. The couple plots to kill Gisaburo and to throw his body in an old well, but this crime would carry a heavy toll on the guilt-ridden lovers. A constable named Hotta (Takuzo Kawatani) is finally drawn by suspicion because of the rumors around the townsfolk, and to make matters worst, Gisaburo's ghost begins to haunt Seki..."Empire of Passion" may carry strong elements of horror, the film only uses this as a backdrop. The film's main premise is very simple, but it is structured well around the destruction by one's succumbing to passion. As I've mentioned, Oshima intended this film as a companion film to his "In the Realm of the Senses", they have similar themes of fallen women, both have a strong social commentary, and both films express the idea that desire may lead to destruction. The main characters of Sada and Kichi in the film "In the Realm of the Senses" carry parallels to Tomoji and Seki's characters in this film. The two pairs from two different films experience uncontrollable desire and lust that ultimately leads to their destruction. Both films are subtle in the commentaries against a totalitarian rule, and are both controversial in their themes of sexuality with women more seen as victims.While "In the Realm of the Senses" express voyeurism within the supporting characters, (geishas and cleaning women; even Sada watches Kichi make love to his wife), the townsfolk in "Empire of Passion" are the kind that gets repulsed by an affair; they gossip and talk about Seki and Toyoji, they renounced the suspected affair but they enjoy talking about it. Both films make a powerful commentary of female sexuality. Seki is a woman caught in the heat of the moment, she refuses but her body gives in to Toyoji's sexual advances. It was quite interesting and the film received widespread criticism when Toyoji rapes Seki while her son Isichi is crying in the other room. Seki's body betrays her and she ends up giving in. Yes, the film contains graphic displays of sexual intercourse but very TAME when compared to "In the Realm of the Senses". Matsuda and Fuji who played Sada and Kichi in Oshima's "In the Realm of the Senses" were actually 'doing' it while Fuji and Yoshiyuki in this film only had simulated sex scenes. Toyoji;s scene with Seki's `shaving' signifies a change of ownership which may be the reason as to why Seki shed tears when Toyoji shaved her private area. Their most erotic scene together maybe the scene when Seki and Toyoji are almost totally covered in mud, until they are caught naked by the constables. All these factors express an ideology to rebel against authority and to make a statement against the expectations of society. While both of Oshima's films express the idea that the law triumphs over desire, it does provide a balance to its indictment of adultery--when the two lovers are tortured by the constables, Oshima expresses a powerful indictment of the wrongs done by some authority figures to lowly folk.This film does have its share of unsettling scenes which enforces its supernatural backdrop. The film is beautifully shot and the cinematography by Yoshio Miyajima looks very good. The shots by Oshima give the Japanese town a certain characteristic that adds to the film's characterization. Oshima also intentionally shoots the folks who gossip as either having their back turned, or their heads turned slightly sideways--to express the idea that gossips are damaging to one's character (true or not) and that there is no way to root out the source. The ghostly scenes looked very surreal and has that ominous feeling of dread, that you know something horrible is about to happen. As with classic films of Japanese horror, the ghost in "Empire of Passion" has the ability to interact, eat and drink. Gisaburo's ghost may mean no harm to Seki, and all he may want is to live in his own house. "Onibaba" obviously has influenced this film, as displayed by the well. I also thought that it was curious to see the autumn leaves being thrown into the well. Oshima also shows the passage of time through the seasons."Empire of Passion" may falter if you look at it from a horror perspective, the film wasn't supposed to be scary but more of an erotic melodrama. The actual antagonist is the situation itself and our protagonists' uncontrollable desire, its consequences expressed by karma. The film was also criticized by being too conventional, and doesn't have that Japanese feel to it, funny, conventional storytelling was began by the Japanese. The one flaw I can say about the film is that it began to lose gas near the end, that some scenes felt a little too stretched out. The film is definitely "kaidan" in its nature, and fans of classic films like "Onibaba" and "Ugetsu" will no doubt enjoy the film. The film carries elements of  a traditional Japanese ghost story with strong social commentary about sexual transgressions, accompanied by eroticism. Those impressed with Oshima's "In the Realm of the Senses" owe it to themselves to see "Empire of Passion". This film is a lot tamer than Oshima's highly controversial film, but it just makes it easier to connect with. After all, how can you resist an erotic film with supernatural elements?Highly Recommended! [4 Stars]

With characters ranging from the hopping undead, a succubus ghost, a loopy priest, and abratty love interest, Mr. Vampire will keep you laughing in its splendid badness. I hear there are 2 more sequels to it that I just may have to check out.

$review_text.: Great gangster movie. A nice departure from usual organized crime films about italian families or the modern day rap star gang bangers. Denzel Washington is a fabulous actor. He consumes the leading role of Frank Lucas, a man from Carolina that is tutored under a crime boss in Harlem for 15 years. After his mentor passes away, he fights to maintain the "kingdom" that was established. He revolutionizes the way that his "type" of business is conducted. Being a true story, I'm glad they didn't only glamourize the gangster lifestyle. They show the way that the drug trade affects the everyday people, including showing junkies passed out on filthy floors while Frank and his family eat Thanksgiving dinner. There's a certain morality to the story once you reach the end of the film. I've loved every movie I've seen where Washington plays the heel.

$REVIEW.: It's hard to imagine an "abortion film" that presents a fairly even-handed view, or at least would be seen as such by the polarized factions eager to cram their politics down your throat, but I think "Vera Drake" does a good job keeping perspective.Vera is a interesting figure, a dowdy, kindly, but almost nave about the gravity of what it is she's doing, namely, "helping" to induce miscarriages among the impoverished young girls, in her threadbare community.  She's definitely not the callous, rubber gloved, bloody smocked-wearing back-alley abortionist, who lights a cigarette and says "next" after doing his evil deed. Yet, in spite of her well-intentioned motivations, she takes no real responsibility for what happens to the girls she administers a unsanitary "home-cooked" douche to, and watching the understandably terrified girls receive this treatment is meant make us shift in our seats. However, Vera recives a rude awakening when (SPOILER ALERT) she eventually does time for her actions, and she meets those who have also performed similar abortions (but for profit) and appear to have no remorse for the girls they've injured or even killed. She also finds out her "friend" that set up her meetings, has been charging the girls, and pocketing the money.Mike Lee sets Vera Drake in post-war England, in a time when a nave, young girls could still find themselves "ruined for life" in the eyes of the community and by their own families, for having babies out of wedlock. The gravity of their situation is illustrated by their very willingness to have these dangerous, painful, and illegal procedures performed on themselves.The men of the time are clearly a mixed lot as well. Vera's own son is unable to forgive his mothers actions, but earlier is seen "eyeing-up" the young girls at a community dance as potential sexual conquests. This scene resonates later, because in spite of his moral indignation toward mom, he could easily be the father of one of the girls she treats.Many of the reviews here, appear to me to have been written by people who haven't actually seen the film, and just want to spout off. My opinion is see it for yourself, judge for yourself, and allow others to do the same. It's a highly complex and thoughtful treatment of the issue at hand.

$REVIEW.: It is very hard to decide which version of Queer as Folk I like best the American or the British.  I watched the British version first and absolutely loved it but was sad that it ended so quickly.  Now I have the first season of the American series, which took the scripts of the British series and adapted them to fit a series that is a long time continuing drama.  (For those of you who love the American version and have not seen the British version I highly, highly recommend buying and watching it.)It was really interesting to see all the changes they made to the British scripts in the American version.  Like the Phil/Ted character who dies in the British version survives the drug overdose in the American version.  I really liked that change.  In fact I have to say that I liked almost all of the changes that the American version made.  Like the fact that the Stuart/Brian character has a more long-term relationship with the Nathan/Justin character.  In my opinion Brian's on going relationship with Justin makes him much more likable than his British counterpart Stuart.  I also like the fact that the Vince/Michael character's relationship with Cameron/David character lasts much much longer in the American version and also has Michael actually moving in with David.  When I really think about it I have to say I like the American version better mainly because it doesn't end.  Because of this it gave the writers of the American series time to fully develop the story lines that ended so abruptly in the British version.

$review_text.: I didn't care to watch it when it was in theaters and I was right. I just watched it on DVD and really sorry for the time wasted. Staring at the wall for 2 hours would be more rewarding.The movie is a set of disjointed action sequences (which are nothing special by themselves) following each other with no rhyme or reason. Daniel Craig is another in the line of impostors unsuccessfully trying to fill Sean Connery's shoes (even Pierce Brosnan was better then DC, and PB wasn't very good either). Other characters are not even 2-dimensional - they are one-dimensional. Really bad acting all around. I was constantly annoyed by something until I figured out what it was: facial expression of the actors when they were saying their lines was irrelevant to what they where doing.

$review_text.: Glazier College will never be the same after The Ghoulies take over the campus! The creatures are unwittingly summoned by one of the professors during fraternity Prank Week, where they get in to more mischief as they terrorize the students

John Carl Buechler assumes the director's chair for the first time in the series after having designed the puppets since the original

GHOULIES 3 combines the college sex romp comedy with the zany cartoon antics of the Looney Tunes characters, going so far as to give the awful little creatures speech (not to mention their cheesy one-liners)


Buechler has further improved upon their design as well for increased mobility and facial articulation
While the film strives to become the next ANIMAL HOUSE or REVENGE OF THE NERDS, the repetitive plot, forgettable characters, and endless amounts of toilet humor cause it to fall desperately short
GHOULIES 3 is just stupid and silly enough to be enjoyable, falling somewhere between the first and second film in terms of overall entertainment value.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies

$REVIEW.: 'To Serve Them All My Days' was published as a book in 1972, and made for telly in 1980. It is, to my knowledge, one of the first series that Andrew Davies wrote the screenplay for -- before going on to 'Very Peculiar Practice' and excellent adaptations of 'Vanity Fair' and 'Pride and Prejudice'. Apart from the last episode in this series, which is a bit of an anti-climax, he does a superb job throughout. The actors all put in career-best performances, which does have a down-side for John Duttine, in that he is still best-known for one of the very first things he did.The potential problem for this series is that it immediately invites comparisons with two other productions. The first is 'Goodbye Mr Chips', which took Robert Donat through his earliest days as a teacher, his loss of his wife and baby, and eventual death in retirement at the school. The second is Michael Palin's first Ripping Yarn, 'Tomkinson's Schooldays', which was filmed at the same location (Milton Abbey School), only a few years earlier. It doesn't help that headmaster Herries is played by Frank Middlemass, who also played a wonderfully sadistic retired general in another Ripping Yarn.But the plot is so good here, and the characterisation so well done and endearing, that the three works seem to enrich each other. Maybe it is because all are sympathetic to the English public school, despite Delderfield putting a socialist headmaster in charge of the senior school and his socialist wife in charge of the prep school. (I haven't read the book, but I assume that these details weren't added just to add piquancy, given that the first transmission was during the early Thatcher years.)If you choose to buy this series in parts, then part three is the most dispensable. The plot loses a bit of momentum once the South African headmaster has died, and frankly the woman that Powlett-Jones chooses to pursue in part three isn't as desirable as the two previous women in his life. The plot becomes so predictable in part three that you half-hope Carter comes back on the scene to antagonise old PJ.The nice little irony at the end is that it isn't necessarily PJ who serves the school all his days -- that honour goes to Howarth.As other reviewers have mentioned, the extras are nothing to write home about: no commentary, no sub-titles or alternative languages, and glorious mono sound. The picture is occasionally jittery -- I assume because a few frames of film were damaged. The BBC would have done a better DVD production job, had they not sold the rights to AcornVideo, but we mustn't grumble.I suspect this is a series you will want to view very swiftly -- perhaps even more than one episode a day if, like me, you have trouble restraining yourself. Depending on the size of your DVD collection, you probably won't watch it again more frequently than once every five years. But you'll really want to lend it to friends and family, just to hear their pleasure at seeing this marvellous series again.

$review_text.: Upon Family Guy's debut after the 1999 Superbowl, Fox had a hit that had sparked a major public interest. Combining elements of The Simpsons and The Critic, Family Guy is the perfect hybrid of comedic genius. While such racy shows as South Park may have hogged the spotlight, Family Guy was able to hold its own on and off for 3 seasons.What makes this show so interesting is the style of animated comedy used. Often in the show, the characters will say something along the lines of &quot;you remember what happened when...,&quot; and a ridiculously funny flashback will show some whacky situation.  For instance, in one episode Peter, the father, recalls his Mexican relative training as a cockfighter (Peter's relative is about 8 inches tall, wearing boxing gloves, and beating up a chicken)Bottom line, this show has a lot of ridiculous humor and I strongly recommend the DVD set for anyone who misses the show.

Richard Lewis and Jaime Lee Curtis fit surprisingly well into the sitcom format.Anyway, when "Seinfeld" came out a year or so after this, I watched a few episodes, didn't care much for it and, said to myself, and anyone else who would listen, "poor Jerry Seinfeld, his show will never take off and be a hit, like Richard Lewis' show."At the urging of some friends, I picked up on Seinfeld in their second season and the rest is history.Regardless of all that, I can't wait to watch these again.

$review_text.: This excellent film is probably the best movie made by the talented Australian director Peter Weir.  While Weir has a made a number of very good films, notably The Year of Living Dangerously and the recent Master and Commander, the subject matter of Gallipoli is the most serious of any of Weir's films.  Gallipoli is the general title for the series of WWI battles in which the Western Allies attempted to force the Dardanelles and knock Turkey out of the war.  Some, including Winston Churchill, himslef one of the prime movers behind the campaign, argued that Allied success at Gallipoli would have been decisive.  This has been disputed by recent historians.  The Gallipoli campaigns were the first large scale attempt at amphibious assault and were an organizational and tactical disaster.  The Allied commanders flubbed several chances to beat the Turks. The Turkish defense was tenacious and much of the action became the trench warfare characteristic of much of WWI.  The Allies failed, at great cost, though Turkish casulties were also quite high.Gallipoli holds a special resonance for Australians.  The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) was the first major overseas participation of Australian and New Zealand troops fighting as national formations.  The ANZACs fought courageously, prefiguring the outstanding performance of Australian and New Zealand infantry in both World Wars.  Gallipoli appears to occupy the place in Australian history that the Civil War occupies in American life.  Australia (possibly also New Zealand) is the only country that regularly celebrates a major military defeat.Weir's movie is a powerful depiction of the Australian experience at Gallipoli.  The story is simple.  A pair of friends from Western Australia enlist, are sent to Gallipoli, and one of them dies in one of the famous and bungled attacks characteristic of the campaign, indeed of the whole war.  Weir uses this conventional war movie formula in particularly creative ways.  A good deal of the movie takes place prior to enlistment.  Weir uses these scenes to convey his image of Australia as rural, provincial, starkly beautiful, and in important ways, profoundly innocent.  The war scenes are beautifully prepared and photographed.  Weir and his team apparently used a careful study of photographs from Gallipoli to construct scenes in the movie.  I recognized parts of scenes as being almost identical to some famous photos of trench life in Gallipoli.  The scenes before and during the climactic assault are devastatingly powerful.This film was made in Australia, by Australians, and for Australians.  Some important aspects of the story are simply assumed.  These are things that would be known by Australians but not by Americans.  The infantry assault depicted in the film were diversions and part of the Battle of Suvla Bay, an attempt to break out of the limited beachheads established in the initial landings.  Had the Suvla Bay attacks been successful, the Allies would have beaten Turkey in 1915.  Suvla Bay almost succeeded and failed largely because of poor leadership and communications.  Because of the latter, the sacrifice of the ANZACs was entirely wasted.  Australian audiences would know this and this fact gives the ending of the film a particularly bitter flavor.  The end of the movie shows the suicidal attack of the Light Horse on entrenched Turkish positions.  The Light Horse suffered 50% casulties that morning.

No matter what political affiliation you have, we must keep checks in place so nothing near this can happen.

Afterwards, I'm told, it wins severed hands down, the award for the most use of blood and guts, ever.  The five star rating comes from the reviews of family and friends who enjoyed it.  It is subtitled, but even that won't deter you if you're a fan of 'slash then dash', 'cut then gut', horror.

$review_text.: First there is a splash screen warning that they didn't have an original master or something to transfer, yet the quality of the finished product looks great to me.Second, the three actual stories were quite good, well acted and filmed. They were based on the work of a lesser known horror author with the same name as the John Carradine character. More information is in the DVD extras.Third, much of the extra material on the DVD was welcomed additional information. The bios and the production notes, for example gave me a lot of knowledge about this movie which doesn't have a lot out there. Some people may enjoy the musical soundtrack which is included. I didn't personally like the music but it's nice to have it as an option.Now the bad parts:4) The wraparound segment introducing portions would have made the movie much better without the annoying musical numbers. The poor production values of this part detract from otherwise great horror stories. The chit chat between John Carradine and Vincent Price is okay, it's just those awful musical numbers that stink. I think that its what kept this little movie from taking off. Please get the movie and give the little stories a chance and go raid the fridge during the musical numbers.5) The bonus "commentary" track is dreadful. I mean awful in it's most terrible form. Two guys of whom I have never heard, prattle on endlessly with little attention to the movie. Occassionally we have to wait while they apparently "look up" information without stopping the prattle. They even get things wrong about the progress of the movie. They would have done better with some bored high school kids.

$REVIEW.: As someone who got hooked on the Amazing Race during season 2, I didn't wait too long to run out and buy the first season so I could go back and see how it all started. It is definitely a trip to see how different the game was when it started, from the rules to things as simple as the color of the route markers. It was definitely interesting to see how people played the game before they had seen people play it before them, so they had no strategies or anything to work off of.Even back in the first season, they still had all the requisite teams. Older married couple, older "life partnered" couple (who I noticed chimed in with their own review already - kind of unethical in my opinion, but after watching them play the game I'm not too surprised by that), parent/child team, separated couple, best friends, and several young couple teams. There were definitely some good moments, and it was fun watching teams who had never left the U.S. before keep up with the world travellers who snubbed their noses at them.My biggest gripe about this season is the lack of special features. There is a roadblock that was not seen in the original season when it aired (although the task was recycled to be used in a later season), commentaries on a few episodes that I will probably never listen to, approximately 90 minutes of extra footage, and a couple other special features. I think my biggest disappointment is with the extra footage. The producers decided to go the way of putting an icon on the screen when extra footage is available and you have to click the enter button to see it. For the amount of money I paid, I would have appreciated it if they would have blended the extra stuff in with the rest of the show. Obviously, there must have been literally weeks worth of extra film taken during the course of the season, and I'm supposed to be grateful for 90 minutes, some of which is already in the episode, and not even get that mixed in with the show?Anyway, I'd definitely recommend at least renting this season if you're a big fan of the show but missed the first season. If you caught it the first time around, there's really not much here to make the purchase worth it, unless you're such a huge fan that you just have to have it.

$review_text.: This wonderful film is loosely based on director Woody Allen's memories of his boyhood in Rockaway, in New York.  A vignette near the beginning of the movie contains a  poignant scene of a rainy and windswept day there.  Practically everything here is based on Woody's fond, and sometimes not so fond, remembrances of the huge affect the radio had in his and his family's lives in the late 1930s and early to mid-1940s.  Many of Woody's memories are incredibly funny, especially Mia Farrow's experiences as a cigarette girl in a nightclub and later, her budding career as an actress and radio commercial personality.  Rarely have I laughed so hard as the time when Ms. Farrow was practicing her elocution lessons.We get to meet some of Woody's teachers including a Hebrew School teacher who thinks he knows how to discipline children better than Woody's parents and a gorgeous elementary substitute teacher that causes one of the male students in his class to believe that he is going "straight to hell."  The film covers radio crime shows (the Masked Avenger, starring the much less than heroic looking Wallace Shawn), morning shows about rich and famous New York swells avidly listened to by Woody's envious working class parents and aunts and uncles.  Diane Wiest is wonderful and very sympathetic as the maiden aunt who wins some money on one of those radio quiz shows. Let me just say that the quiz question is related to a brother-in-law's obsession with fish.  Ms. Wiest also has a less than great adventure concerning a timid date who abandons her in his automobile during the infamous Orson Welles radio broadcast of the "War of the Worlds."  There is also a sad news broadcast concerning a little girl who falls down a well and the efforts to rescue her.  Woody and his family are arguing at the time about some petty mischief young Woody had gotten into, but the family stops to listen to this saga that brings his family and probably the rest of the country together.As in many of Woody Allen's films, the popular tunes of the period provide enjoyable and nostalgic background music to the film.  What more can I say: I loved this film and recommend that you either rent or purchase it as soon as you can.

$REVIEW.: Four great seasons of the ultimate gangster saga.  The fifth and (final) sixth should firmly cement the legacy of this stalwart series.Season One is the best of the group, as it usually is with most stellar series.  The best episodes:  #9, #12 and #13.  Season Two's finest moments are with the epitome of all evil, Richie Apriel, played with intense sinisterness by David Proval, and the David Lynch-esque finale.Season Three welcomes Ralphie C (Joe Pantaliano) and Season Four ushers him out in grand style (that will prove to be a defining moment in the shows history).  Season Four also has some sensitive moments from Tony Soprano himself:  His all night vigil with a sick horse (as Dean Martin sings &quot;My Rifle, My Pony &amp; Me&quot;), his tolerance of Christopher's drug addiction (and the hilarious intervention that follows).  Great series, great set.  Watch them all.

I had high hopes going in given the amazing critic reviews and I was not let down in any way
Robert Downey Jr


lays down a great performance that easily ranks as one of the best ever in this genre of film

He is funny, smart, cool and just a unique individual
The supporting cast from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jeff Bridges are in fine form as well

The main reason I loved this movie so much was the fact that the cheese factor was very low (more like Batman than the cheese heavy Spiderman), not to mention all the cool tech gadgets

The CGI is only used when needed and looks realistic.My entire sold out theater went crazy throughout the movie and I must admit I even did at times


While The Dark Knight looks to be the film to beat this summer, Iron Man is truly a worthy foe

Now bring on the Iron Man 2!

$REVIEW.: This film, in many ways, is a perfect Rivette film.  It is the perfect example of his work and his total universe.  It possesses many traits of his finest films.  There's so much to enjoy here that it's hard to really write a review, but I'll try.The film really doesn't have a huge amount of plot.  It's essentially two women, Celine and Julie, talking about a haunted house and hanging out there with the spirits who inhabit it (or it could be all in their minds.  Rivette doesn't specify).  Celine and Julie meet at the beginning of the film in a wonderful, dialog less sequence running nearly 20 minutes.  Celine becomes fascinated with the more free spirited Julie, and they become friends.  That's really the summation of the plot.Celine and Julie Go Boating (great title, by the way) has ethereral scenes that are sometimes startling and haunting.  It is also whimsical (the scenes where Julie and Celine keep visiting the ghosts over and over again, and doing something different each time, is completely engrossing and could make a seperate feature film in itself), and cats make some memorable appearances here as they do in all Rivette's films.  And it has a completely enigmatic, sudden ending that makes it more haunting.  Rivette's magnum opus, Out 1, ends like that, along with much of his work.  The only other filmmaker I know whose films just end is Manoel de Oliveira.  Rivette's films are criticised by many for being long (this one runs 193 minutes, average for a Rivette film), but they are so full of invention that the time just flies by, quite like the films of the above mentioned Manoel de Oliveira.  This is a wonderful film that should be better known, as it is one of Rivette's true masterpieces, along side Out 1, La Belle Noiseuse, Secret Defense (his most underrated work), and L'amour Fou.
$review_summary.: One of Rivette's signature films, a masterpiece....

$review_text.: Based on a novel by Irving Welsh, this film focusses on the adventures of a small band of friends united by their dependency on heroin. They have good times and bad times and eventually, they set out on a scheme to make  them all rich.The characters are, in no way, every day people but the  film makes them all believable and, in the end the viewer finds that they  are relating to the characters and caring about the outcome. Despite the  hysteria that greeted this film in the UK's conservative press, in no way  does it glorify the use of heroin. Instead it paints a pretty offputting  picture of the drug.The film ranges from sad to funny and it is always  gripping. A great film.

$REVIEW.: Two days ago, I saw this movie for the first time. I was blown away!I've been reading the other reviews of this movie here. It's not in my nature to repeat what others have eloquently pointed out. But there was one thought that kept coming back to me again and again while I watched it. And in doing so, perhaps I will contribute to the uncovering of this movie's artistic value.There was absolutely nothing in the behavior of the various characters in this movie that human beings in our own society have not done again and again since the beginning of recorded history. We haven't changed much at all. We've only refined the more or less same primate behavior that was portrayed in this movie. In the end, all technology is a prosthetic of human imagination; whether it's a stone ax and crude fire making, or vast communication networks and arsenals of enough weaponry to destroy all life on this planet 100 time over. The motives are the same as always.There are very few exceptions to this - but perhaps enough to inspire optimism for the hope and future of humanity.

It starts off with a farm kid getting snatched from the corn field leaving behind his older brother and father who can't belive wht they witnessed.The main story revolves around a high school basketball team on a bus. The Creeper has homemade throwing stars (made from human parts of course) to flatten the tires. He then snatches them up one by one for feeding time. The kids try their best to defeat him with a javelin and a flaregun.But the farmer returns with a homemade, gas powered harpoon. After some fighting and struggling he thinks he defeats the Creeper, but he's only sleeping.We exit 23 years later with the farmer ready to face him again. The Creeper hangs from his barn ceiling and you can see it for &quot;Five bucks a gander.&quot;Not the greatest horror movie of all time, but better than average.

$REVIEW.: This movie touched my heart! It was a beautiful love story, that transcends time, and it is about a handsome, modern day playwright, who falls in love with a photographed painting, of a very beautiful woman, who lived in 1912!I loved Richard Collier's handsome self! Christopher Reeve (Richard Collier), was so good looking and handsome, and so full of charm, this is the type of man that can take a women's breath away, by just being near him! Richard feels so empty in his life, as a famous playwright, until he takes a vacation, and sees the painting of Elise! Elise was a very famous actress in her day! Richard can't get the picture of Elise out of his mind, and then Richard finds a way to travel thur time, so that he can meet Elise! During Richard's research, he also finds out that in his modern present day life, that he has already met Elise, when she was old, and at that time, he did not know who she was! But she immediately knew, who Richard was, and she even spoke to him!I loved the scene where Richard and Elise ( Jane Seymour) meet when Elise was young, while she is walking by the lake! I thought Jane was perfect for this part, she was so beautiful! I also loved the scene where Richard came to Elise's room to ask her to take a walk with him! I also loved Elise's beautiful clothes, and hats, and I loved the way she did her long, pretty hair!In this movie I so loved ,the heartfelt emotion, and passion, that Richard and Elise had for each other, it was so profound! I loved the chemisty between Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour
The theatre scene where Elise yearns for a man to touch the secret regions of her heart was awesome! And one small scene that really touched my heart, was the scene showing, how that photograped painting of Elise was made, that Richard fell so in love with, Wow!I also loved , the beautiful, soul stirring music to this movie, it says it all! I thought all the actors in this movie did a outstanding job, especially Christopher Plummer, (Elise's manager, and mentor)! You will need tissues for this movie, I have seen it many times, over the years, and I cry each time! I highly recommend this, awesome, special movie!

$review_text.: This movie brings life to a story that I admittedly knew little about despite the coverage it had. What really sticks out to me is that the movie doesn't do the story the disservice of painting Oscar Grant as a saint. He is represented as a mere human- flawed but loving, with a past but trying to do his best now, a young man who loves his family even though they may clash. Michael B Jordan did a wonderful job portraying Grant.The only criticism I have is that I think the story was a bit short. It seemed like something was missing from the story, either before Grant goes to jail or after he is tragically killed. Consequently it felt more like a longer docudrama (albeit one with great performances) than an actual movie.This is an heartbreaking story that needed to be told if only to bring Oscar Grant and his family a little justice.

$REVIEW.: 1

This is not a childrens' Anime just like most Japanese Anime
This is not Disney/Pixar
Most Japanese Anime are darker than any Watchmen or anything American ever was and will.2
As with most Japanese Anime, it contains extreme propaganda agenda of the creator

Unfortunately this anime is about Victimization of Japan during WW2 by American aggressors.I am shocked and horrified by the Anime which is very widely embraced and praised

Ever so lovely Setsuko who seem to be around 4-5 year of age is constantly begging for viewer's attention and love


And she is a lovely baby girl
Pure and innocent, obvious victim of nuclear bomb whose body is fading away but her spirit is high with love and attention from Seita who is also dying from American nuclear bomb.Amazon's Editorial Reviews claims that the "strength of Grave of the Fireflies lies in ** doctor, ** aunt, ** cousins" That's simply not the case if you see the it

Anime is from the start to the end begging for sympathy for Victimized Japanese of WW2 who suffered terrible tragedy through air raids and nuclear bomb dropped by evil American Empire

It starts out with the bomb, and every few minutes you are reminded through air raid sound and scene why Setsuko is suffering

The whole movie is about 2 most innocent Japanese victims through the hands of American nuclear bomb and how it should not be repeated

Sadly, for every Setsuko there were 100 if not 1000 other Asians girls who went through bigger tragedy

And this movie wasn't about Japan's imperial ambition which brought such tragedy by one nation to whole of Asia
It isn't about how Japanese should recognize what they did to cause 1000s of Setsuko around Asia and even in US through their dead GI dads


This is solely about how "innocent" Japan was victimized by nuclear bomb carrying evil Americans.If you have watch the whole movie and didn't understand its powerful propaganda I don't know what to say

What if the boy was German boy near a factory in Dresden, would you have caught what it was trying to say?I guess it comes down to a question of whether propaganda is an art or not

Or maybe people enjoy well made propaganda as much as any other type of art
Even if it was saying Japan the rapist, murderer of millions were the 4 year old victim of WW2 by Mighty American nuclear bomb


Will you teach your kid that lesson?--All propaganda has to be popular and has to adapt its spiritual level to the perception of the least intelligent of those towards whom it intends to direct itself.-A
Hitler, Mein Kampf

$review_text.: "Being There"-- so what DOES the title mean? Ilana Douglas, (real-life granddaughter of Melvyn Douglas, whose impeccable portrayal of the old tycoon justifiably won him his second Oscar in a long and worthy career) in the short reminisce that comprises the entirety of the "special features", said that to her "Being There" meant being in the moment. That Peter Sellers' characterization of the man known alternately as Chance the Gardener and Chauncey Gardener was so strong it kind of drug everyone else in and there was a kind of onscreen reality, if you will, a "being in the moment" that happened and made this film the profound masterpiece that it is.I am not one to disagree with that take. It is equally viable as any of my own thoughts on the subject, (depending on your point of view) yet perhaps there is more to it than that. I have found that many trully great pieces of art posses a certain ambiguity about them that goes beyond anything the author originally intended. A meaning that is only revealed through the realization of the work itself, a force which surpasses any conceptual inspiration. I think this is the "Being There" that Ilana Douglas refers to. When Peter Sellers went "full-on retard", as it were, "full-on shut-in" rather, the rest of the cast could not but help to follow suit in their portrayals of what are essentially cultural caricatures, and magic was made in front of the camera lens. No denying that. However, there is another aspect of "Being There", something that may in fact be more intentional and blatant as conceived by the author of the book this film is based on, yet, because most people aren't willing to climb the ladder's top rung, usually remains much more evasive.Follow me if you will down this rabbit hole;I couldn't help thinking that it harks back to the old adage about "being a fly on the wall". Have you ever had that notion when thinking about how the corporate sector and the political structure of our country and the world is really run at the top? To be a fly on the wall during those subtle, intimate moments when old, bloodless creatures congregate and deals are struck, policies are shifted and Atlas shrugs? Of course we are able to see the aftermath of many of these moments, which allows those of us who get beyond the smoke and mirrors and dog and pony tricks to understand the nature of the course our society is on, and where it is being steered-- but to hear it from their own curmudgeonly lips! To hear them acknowledge public sentiment against their tyranny yet justify it as necessary for the good of the species in the long run!-- perhaps just after they've been pumped full of another fresh batch of blood to keep them in good spirits as per Chance's first encounter with old Ben Rand. "Some call me a 'kingmaker', but I've stayed true to myself, and that's what matters most of all , my boy."Wasn't this concept (the fly on the wall, the emotionless being who likes to watch, etc.) the onus of what this film was actually all about? One of the most cleverly disguised depictions of what life is really like at the top? To be a master of the world, to live as if life will never end, as if you will be at the controls forever, and yet, to still be powerless against death when your time has come. To have it all, to live in opulence and luxury while the rest of the world goes to the dogs,(as so poignantly depicted when the Gardener leaves the house he's spent his whole life shut up in for the first time) yet, in the end, to be drug down to Sheol with the rest of us.So it is that we get to observe our overlords (or at least their caricatures) throught the glinted eyes of a perpetual voyeur (the fly on the wall), the only one of us "down-to-earth" enough to be allowed within their hallowed walls. A character sought after and hobknobbed by the upper eschalon by virtue of his rare optimism and seeming lack of judgementalism, a trait which tends to infect all those of us not quite placated enough to be content to just watch.Which begs the question concerning the "common man"'s role in modern civilization; are we nothing more than voyeurs? Our thoughts shaped and controlled by the fabricated envoirnment we live in on this tedius journey through life, watching the big men make their moves on deck while kept safely locked away down in the holding regions below?How about that tomb, eh? A beautiful, little beady eye that makes the one on the back of the dollar bill look like a pale imitation. A legacy for a proud, life-long upholder of The Code, a fitting monument, built in finely hewn stone, built to last. The pallbearers hastily deciding momentous strategy in hushed tones while bringing the old man to his tomb-- er, ah..."final resting place". The show must go on, plenty more runners to snatch up the baton and carry on.Jack Warden as president!! The first time he appears onscreen is from afar, yet I recognized his craggy features (talk about finely hewn!)from that instant and it filled my heart with glee. What a man, eh? From "Twelve Angry Men", to "...And Justice For All", to "Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead", one was never disappointed with a performance from old Jack. Or his cousin Robert Loggia, for that matter. (Somehow the two are inexplicably linked within the caverns of my mind.) Fitting how his character eulogized the deceased, his own doubts and impotence weighing on him like a roped man at the gallows.Yes, a lot to digest in this flick, many a hearty meal for the cranial sponge to soak in. Watch it again and again, let it marinate your senses.Other musings gleaned in passing: *The firm handshake and stiff upper lip. *An ascot and fine taste in all things good. *The rich are fanciful creatures-- they can afford to be. *A proper gentleman, a pillar of stregth to those that succomb easily to temptation and desperation. "I like to watch..." yes, I do too.

$REVIEW.: If you recognize the name Ellen Aim you know your cult sci-fi rock movies, or, as director Walter Hill called his 1984 film Streets of Fire,  your "rock and roll fable[s]."Ellen Aim and the Attackers are a band that plays in an alternate version of the eighties, or maybe an alternate version of the fifties


 It's either the eighties that couldn't let go of Elvis and pre-British Invasion rock and roll, or it's the fifties anticipating an urban underclass where everyone is on the edge of violence

 Walter Hill loads the movie with a retro neon look, blending genres, similar to what he did in 1979's The Warriors, where he mixed the post-war social-issue movie with the seventies exploitation film, along with some ancient Greek history
 (As Cyrus, the would-be savior of all the warrior gangs, booms at us, "Can you dig it?")Michael Pare (as Tom Cody) stars in Streets of Fire
 Cody's just out of the army in a what-if America that still has the social restraints from fifties Tab Hunter movies, but wallows in the corruption and depravity of Reagan's eighties
 On this particular morning in America it's raining and everyone's on the verge of killing someone


 Willem Dafoe's first appearance as Raven, the villain in black rubber, fresh from God knows what perversity, to the song "One Bad Stud" performed by the Blasters ("If he likes your baby, you can kiss your baby goodbye"), may be what got him typecast as a psycho in so many movies.But in a fifties movie there has to be a love story


 You can't have a guy without a girl

 There has to be a Natalie Wood for James Dean, even if the romance is between James Dean and Sal Mineo


 In Streets of Fire, Michael Pare's Natalie Wood is Diane Lane as singer Ellen, who Aims her Attack straight at your heart while she caresses one of those old round microphones that look like a hood ornament
 Raven kidnaps Ellen and her old boyfriend Tom Cody (Buffalo Bill to the rescue) is called to save her

 Unfortunately, Lane doesn't get to do much more than play the frail here.Cody's real emotional connection is with McCoy (Amy Madigan), another vet who makes Cody hire her to rescue Ellen

 McCoy brushes off Cody's half-hearted passes with "You're not my type."  McCoy wears greasy old clothes and fixes cars better than Cody so I think I get the point


 Especially when McCoy leers at a female nude dancer at the club where Ellen is being held


 It seems like the movie was going to be more explicit about McCoy's sexuality but chickened out.I won't spoil the story but you know how it ends.I have a soft spot for movies that are original, even if they're not entirely successful

 The music's good, the look of the film pulls you into its unique world, and the story is one of those mythic restatements that move you even when you know they're corny.

$REVIEW.: Sometimes we leave wondering why Verdi's opera was not titled PHILIPPE II, ROI D'ESPAGNE. On this occasion, however, we might feel it should have been called ELISABETH DE VALOIS, for the Queen is the most interesting and fully realized figure in stage director Nicholas Hytner's production (shared by the Met, Norwegian National Opera, and Royal Opera House Covent Garden; EMI's DVD is a composite of three summer 2008 ROH performances). Hytner and soprano Marina Poplavskaya have brought much care and imagination to the heroine's gradual progression from coltish, mischievous young girl to fatalistic, disillusioned monarch, and their work is persuasive. They make Elisabetta's every look, gesture, and attitude seem integral and supported by text and music, whether the choice is traditional or not (e.g. Elisabetta's helpless look back at Carlo as she is carried away in the celebratory procession at the close of Act I; the flash of anger aimed Filippo's way during the farewell to the banished Countess, a solo thankfully given its full two-verse due here; the sprinklings of pride and haughtiness amidst the protestations of innocence in Act IV Scene 1). Poplavskaya, as always, is a fascinating face to watch, and she looks show-stoppingly glamorous in a series of period gowns by Tony Award winner Bob Crowley. Even the changes in her coiffure from scene to scene tell us something of the character's inner life.If the voice that comes out when this sensitive actress opens her mouth is not the sort we think of as that belonging to a "Verdi soprano" in the classic line, it is an interesting one in its own right, and it is the one belonging to the woman attempting the part. With adjustment for vocal category, the same could be said of other cast members. Both Simon Keenlyside (Rodrigo) and Sonia Ganassi (Eboli) must work hard for the high notes to which their music frequently guides them; each sounds most comfortable in the midrange. Keenlyside's portrayal seems unfinished. It is difficult to know whether stray tics and mannerisms we see, little smirks and squints, a curious rigidity of posture at baseline, are the character's or his own. At the Met, with a different eponymous tenor (Roberto Alagna) opposite Keenlyside, Hytner seemed to me to have encouraged a subtext to the Carlo/Rodrigo relationship that probably had not occurred to Schiller, Verdi, or the librettists, but is increasingly fashionable in modern stagings. For example, Keenlyside obviously was playing barely concealed delight when Alagna's Carlo began to confide his "sinful love," and when the object of the sinful love was revealed to be Carlo's stepmother and not Rodrigo himself, the baritone played disappointment along with the usual shock and revulsion. This is less obvious on the ROH DVD. Ganassi is a considerable improvement over the unfocused, pitch-indeterminate Anna Smirnova, who replaced her for the 2010-11 Met performances, but Ganassi is another in a long line of mezzo-sopranos who lack the flexibility for the Veil Song. Her native credentials serve her well in terms of both style and delivery of text, but her deportment works against the concept of a glamorous seductress of the royal court; she is less than an ideal foil for Poplavskaya's elegant Queen.Ferruccio Furlanetto has previously appeared on video as both the Grand Inquisitor (the 1983 Met/DG) and Filippo (the 1986 Karajan performance of the four-act abridgement, on Sony). Here, all that mars a powerful portrayal of the King is a tendency to depart from the sung line by shouting, modifying pitches, and cheating note values. I prefer to believe these are Furlanetto's crafty ways of working around narrowing resources, because if they are expressive choices, they stand out starkly against the greater portion of his contemplative work. Eric Halfvarson is also an old hand at the Grand Inquisitor (over a decade earlier, he appeared in the French-language Chtelet performance with the same conductor, also on DVD). At this point, so entrenched is the practice of casting basses who have the remnants of a voice as the Inquisitor, I no longer go in expecting to hear the musical line honestly, securely sung. This seems to have devolved into a character part, where stage presence, skill at declamation, and the ability to look and sound convincing as a 90-year-old relic are prized over absolute musical values. Within those strictures, Halfvarson does accomplished work. Robert Lloyd, having progressed in previous years through Filippo and the Inquisitor, completes his trifecta of this opera's bass roles by appearing as the Monk, and he is effective in the brief role.The major liability, sadly, is Rolando Villaz&oacute;n as Don Carlo himself. This ROH run occurred between his first and second withdrawals from the stage, before his vocal cord surgery, but no knowledge at all of his medical biography is required to hear that he was in serious trouble and would have been wiser to cancel. When the music lies low and the specified dynamic is undemanding, there are reminders of the fine instrument with which he first appeared on the international circuit; but the voice is dry and lacking in polish, core, and stability, and the resulting performance consistently strained. With three dates from which to compile, the makers of the DVD have kept out major calamities, but the tenor constantly sounds on the verge of cracking, and any listener who knows where the music of this long and difficult part is leading, what hurdles lie ahead, is likely to be kept on the edge of his/her seat in the wrong way. It is unfortunate that Jonas Kaufmann's assumption of the role in the ROH's subsequent revival was not chosen for preservation instead. Villaz&oacute;n's fans are better off with the earlier DVD of Willy Decker's Amsterdam DON CARLO (four acts, on Opus Arte). Here, he hobbles through with a likable personality and not much more.Antonio Pappano's conducting has matured since the previous Kultur DVD of an eccentric pick-a-mix edition (frequently misadvertised as "the original French DON CARLOS"). The ROH Orchestra plays very well for him, and they are well recorded -- the high-quality audio and video are major pluses. Hytner's physical production has been controversial for its hard-edged, none-too-lavish scenic design (e.g. the bright-red "Lego wall" before which Eboli entertains the ladies of the court) and for the addition of an actor delivering spoken dialogue as a fanatical priest in the auto-da-f&eacute;, covering Verdi's cornet solo (ceremonial music frequently cut altogether, it is worth noting). But the director is alert to character possibilities, most successfully in the handling of the Queen but also in the central confrontation between Rodrigo and Filippo, the motivations, conflicts, and agendas of which emerge with force and precision (Keenlyside and Furlanetto are at their best in that duet too, and everyone benefits from Pappano's clarification of the musical development). Hytner also attempts with some success to unify this sprawling work by isolating Carlo at scene endings, "orphaning" him on the stage by lowering a wall behind him that hides everything and everyone else from view.My first choice DON CARLO/S DVD at the time of this writing (from a field encompassing both languages and several versions of the score) remains the first video of the opera released in any format, the Met 1983. This offers a generous performing edition (everything the ROH 2008 has, plus the rarely performed opening scene for Elisabetta and her war-deprived people), impressive orchestral playing under James Levine, John Dexter's evocative traditional production, and a cast including several great 20th-century singers in roles with which they were closely identified. Even if no one was having the best day of his or her life, they come out well ahead of most of the competition. The new ROH, more clearly a product of our present age in its state-of-the-art technical credits and its director's attention to matters of acting, is a respectable contender for the "place" position.

$REVIEW.: It seems a shame that Greta Garbo ended her illustrious career at the age of 36 with this ridiculous mistaken-identity marital romp

Coming off the success of her first romantic comedy, Ernst Lubitsch's masterful "Ninotchka" (1939), where she was ideally cast as an austere Russian envoy, Garbo is reunited with her leading man Melvyn Douglas for a sitcom-level story that has her playing Karin Borg, a plain-Jane ski instructor who impulsively marries publishing executive Larry Blake when he becomes smitten with her

Once he makes clear that work is his priority, Karin inadvertently decides to masquerade as her high-living twin sister Katherine to test her husband's fidelity when he is back in Manhattan.It's surprising that this infamous 1941 misfire was directed by George Cukor, who led Garbo to her greatest dramatic performance in 1937's "Camille", because this is as unflattering a vehicle as one could imagine for the screen legend


Only someone with Carole Lombard's natural sense of ease and mischief could have gotten away with the shenanigans presented in the by-the-numbers script by S.N
Behrman, Salka Viertel and George Oppenheimer
MGM's intent behind this comedy was to contemporize and Americanize Garbo's image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested in the tragic period characters she favored in the thirties.However, Garbo appears ill-at-ease mostly as the bogus party girl Katherine and especially compared to expert farceurs like Douglas and Constance Bennett as romantic rival Griselda
Photographed unflatteringly by Joseph Ruttenberg, Garbo looks tired in many scenes and downright hideous in her teased hairdo for the "chica-choca" dance sequence


The story ends conventionally but with the addition of a lengthy physical sequence where Larry tries to maneuver his skis on a series of mountain cliffs that unfortunately reminds me of Sonny Bono's death
Roland Young and Ruth Gordon (in a rare appearance at this point of her career) show up in comic supporting roles as Douglas' associates


This movie is not yet on DVD, and I wouldn't consider it priority for transfer as it represents a curio in Garbo's otherwise legendary career
She was reportedly quite unhappy during the filming
I can see why.

It's still a fine film non the less and the DVD transfer looks nice and crisp,....I noticed some blurs here and there, but that could be from the original source.

$review_text.: You know the story. Ian Curtis, lead singer/songwriter for Joy Division, tragically ends his young life just as one of the most influential post-punk UK bands from the late 70's begins their climb to fame.This movie begged to be filmed in black and white, and thankfully Anton Corbijn had the good sense to do it. The cinematography, score (if you want to call it a "score" - it is mainly songs by other artists, such as Bowie, Lou Reed, and Kraftwerk, that influenced Curtis), and casting are all top notch. Sam Riley is uncanny as Ian Curtis, and Samantha Morton as Debbie Curtis and Alexandra Maria Lara as Annik Honore probably could not have been cast better either. Tony Kebbel is a kick to watch as Rob Gretton.As long is one is aware the movie focuses primarily on Curtis's relationship with his wife and his affair with Annik Honore, all is well. And there is enough musical footage thrown in to satisfy most Joy Division fans, which, I might add, is as about as realistic as one could ever expect from a movie. There are however, two or three parts of the film of which I must be critical. The first is technical in nature but to me is huge. There is a scene in the studio when the engineer is taping "Isolation" - Ian is laying down the vocal track to the already existing band tracks. Why in God's name, after putting so much effort into getting Riley to sound like Curtis (which in 90% of the movie was amazingly successful), do they allow him to sing Isolation in a way which sounds nothing like Curtis at all? This scene mystifies me completely. Riley sounds like a sick choir boy, so I was expecting the engineer to say "Ian, what's wrong?"...but at the end of the song he tells him, essentially, "great job, that's a wrap". Sorry, no. That vocal track isn't even close to reality. The second issue is with the ending. Corbijn seems to be suggesting Ian took his life primarily as a result of his anguish over relationship issues, his love for Annik and guilt over what he had done to his wife. This is of course a distinct possibility, and no one will ever know the truth, but to those who know the history, the music, the lyrics, the environment, the epilepsy....this implication seems a little over-simplistic (although to be fair, since the movie was based on Debbie Curtis's book "Touching From a Distance", perhaps Corbijn was trying to stay true to what she had written, and I have not read that book). Also, Corbijn made it seem Curtis's suicide was almost a "last minute", or at best, a "last hour", decision. Again....maybe. But it didn't ring true to my sense of what was likely. Your mileage may vary. Finally, I was disappointed there was no mention of the album "Closer", even though we hear tracks from it. Odd to say the least.Certainly a film worth seeing, but for the true Joy Division aficionado, get the documentary by Grant Gee. Superb.

$review_text.: The Blu-Ray AND the regular ("Ultimate 2-Disc Edition") dvds have the best prints I've ever seen of these films
 The Blu-Ray is marginally sharper, but you really have to compare the two versions back-to-back and almost microscopically to tell the difference (I do have both versions).The "Three Ages" is a problematic film due to nitrate decomposition; I agree that on both films, Kino would have done us a big favor by "enhancing" the movies with some digital cleanup: given the clarity of the Blu-Ray, I believe you would never notice any "compromise" in the quality of the picture even with the digital noise reduction

 At the very least this should be done in the titles and the fade-outs, where scratches are most noticeable


 (I certainly see no loss of quality in the digitally "enhanced versions" on Kino's set of Keaton's 19 short films.)  Nevertheless, the image itself is certainly as sharp as you're ever going to get, and the pictures have adequate contrast but with lots of detail.The music is a different matter

 I very much like the Robert Israel soundtrack for "Three Ages"

 However, it seems to be out of sync around the middle of the film (sound is a few frames late to the picture), then goes back in sync a little later

 It's not terrible, but I always notice this when it happens (when Keaton whacks his rival on the head and there is a musical highlight at that moment, I just naturally expect the sound to match the picture, and if it's late I'm disappointed).It surprises me that given three different sound tracks for "Sherlock Jr." not one of them is completely successful

 The Mont Alto score works the best for me


 Mont Alto is a very professional small ensemble and they always play pleasant and winsome music

 But their skill at matching music-to-picture is wildly variable

 They do such satisfying work with their scores for the Flicker Alley anthology "Georges Melies: First Wizard of Cinema" that I have often put on a film just because I like their music so much!  On the other hand, their music for "Chaplin at Keystone" ranges from pleasant to curious to maddening: Chaplin is dashing about, leaping and (literally) kicking rear-ends; people are tumbling and flying through the air madly at super-sonic speeds..

and the Mont Alto is playing a slow waltz
 What in the world were they thinking?  Were they even watching the movie?Similarly, in "Sherlock Jr.", there are times when the Mont Alto players seem unaware that there is actually a COMEDY going on
 They begin the film with mock-serious music to play along with Keaton's character, who is taking himself too seriously; but the music is so austere and lacking in whimsy that it stops working for the irony and only bogs down the comedy (their 'crime-investigation' music, see below, is much better)


 But their next couple of choices are better...until the Other Suitor enters the living room

 Here the music is pretty cold
 One moment in particular leaves me shaking my head every time I think about it: while Mont Alto plays slow and frankly rather gloomy music (as if for a tragedy!) Keaton takes a mind-boggling, back-breaking prat fall; the music just continues to drone on slowly and grimly
 Rather than being funny, the effect is odd
 A little later, when the movie actually becomes, temporarily, tragic, the music is very effective.Even given their many miscalculations, I still prefer the Mont Alto soundtrack over the Club Foot Orchestra, which quickly becomes annoying, and over Jay Ward's scratchy and hissy "vintage jazz score", which is not sensitively compiled

 The Mont Alto score is full of engaging and memorable tunes
 And I must give them their due: once they decide to play more up-beat and up-tempo music to match Keaton's rhythm as he "shadows the suspect", their music becomes a perfect match to the action, and really charming
 Their `crime-investigation' music (while Buster plays pool) is a good fit to the picture, being both mock-serious AND very witty; but they start this particular music about a minute too late (it should begin just after Keaton enters the home and removes his coat)


 And their chase music (again, they start too late) is great stuff, really adding to the delight of the film

 They end the movie with appropriately thoughtful  music


 The music from the chase to The End fits the picture so incredibly well, is so appealing and rememberable that it is now impossible for me to imagine the movie without this music.So, 10 stars out of 5 for "Sherlock Jr." as a masterwork of cinema, 4 out of 5 for "Three Ages"; 4 out of 5 for Kino's crisp and clear reproductions (minus half a star because they did nothing to clean up the scratches, and another minus 1/2 for the sound-sync problem), 4 stars for the music to "Three Ages" (both the music for the complete film, and the organ scores for the re-cut versions are good), and varying from 2 to 5 stars for the music to "Sherlock Jr."If you've got the extra money, love Keaton, and you do not have a local vintage theatre that shows these films with excellent live accompaniment, then I do recommend buying this dvd.

The beginning of the movie kinda reveals the thrill level of the entire movie-- boring. At first, I thought perhaps it might be like Cloverfield (which was, surprisingly, a good sci fi movie, slow start, great finish) but it was not. If you do not mind watching a movie with low budget special effects, tons of unanswered questions, and rather average to poor actors, this movie is for you; however while watching, I suggest you sit comfortably and have a fluffy pillow handy cause your gonna need it.

$review_text.: I saw this movie waaaay back as a 17 yr. old.  Today on the oldies station, they were playing the BEATLE's Sgt. Pepper's music...YUCK! As far as I'm concerned, P. Frampton and the Bee Gee's version was beautifully done.  Also, loved the female who sang Strawberry Fields. I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this movie back then...and I'm going to order it and see how I feel about it now that I'm well into my 40s.  Peter Frampton, the Bee Gees, Aerosmith...wow...they were "IT" back then!

$review_text.: To this day, I watch this trilogy over and over again, and its still as great as the first time I watched them!  Whats interesting to me is the future scene 2015, and how the screenwriters envisioned the future


 Now that we are in the year 2007, its interesting see some of these things exist now, like marty's shoes look alot like some of the sneakers of today, the women with the breast implants! some of the building and car designs are pretty close also

 The only thing they were really off on, was the flourescent in the clothes, the flourescent stuff was big IN the 80's how would that be the style 30 years later?Very Classic trilogy if you ask me!![...]

$review_text.: Pink Floyd singer and guitarist David Gilmour just released his new DVD entitled Remember That Night - Live From the Royal Albert Hall and is indeed a MUST for all David Gilmour and Pink Floyd fans.I got the Best Buy version (with a bonus live CD including the AOL Sessions EP) and I have already watched this DVD three times and it is SUPERB! For those who were at The Royal Albert Hall and/or any of his solo shows (I envy you) this is a great souvenir and for those of us who weren't (like me) it shows us what we all missed.There are 23 (technically 25 counting the outro and the intermission) songs on the concert disc of 'Remember That Night', which documents the Royal Albert Hall shows of May 29, 30 and 31, 2006.Gilmour was backed onstage by fellow Floyd member keyboard player Rick Wright, PF 1987 alum which were keyboard player Jon Carin and bass player Guy Pratt, Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera and drummer Steve DiStanislao. Plus, there are guest appearances by David Crosby, Graham Nash (2/3 of Crosby, Stills and Nash and/or 1/2 of Crosby Stills Nash and Young take your pick), Robert Wyatt and the Thin White Duke and rock music's real chameleon David Bowie.The first set begins with three from Dark Side of the Moon which are "Speak to Me", "Breathe", "Time" and "Breathe (Reprise)" (all are excellent versions). Next is the On an Island portion and "Castellorizon" is amazing live, "On An Island" (with Crosby and Nash) is excellent, "The Blue" (with Crosby and Nash) is just awesome live, "Red Sky at Night", "This Heaven", "Then I Close My Eyes" (with Robert Wyatt) is an excellent version, "Smile" is good, "Take A Breath" is excellent live (this track was first released on the OAI CD/DVD set as a taster for the DVD), "A Pocketful of Stones" and an excellent "Where We Start" to finish set one of the first DVD.Next is the intermission film, quite funny.The second set starts with "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" (with Crosby and Nash) then a spirited "Fat Old Sun", "Coming Back To Life", "High Hopes", a spellbinding version of "Echoes", "Wish You Were Here", "Find The Cost Of Freedom" (with Crosby and Nash), a stellar "Arnold Layne" (with David Bowie) and a jawdropping version of "Comfortably Numb" (with David Bowie).The second DVD contains other Royal Albert Hall performances of "Dominoes", "Wots...Uh the Deal", "Wearing the Inside Out" and "Arnold Layne and "Comfortably Numb" (sans Bowie but doesn't include Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason out of fear of Pink Floyd reunion to boost sales).The second DVD also features three documentaries (one called Breaking Bread Pouring Wine (documenting the tour from March to August of 2006 and there are cameos by Nick and (shock, gasp, horror) Roger Waters who wished David good luck on his second leg and vice versa and seems the feud between them is finally over for good, I remain a swan song from PF is in the cards and Nick Mason and Rick Wright and even Roger Waters want to resurrect PF one last time whilst Gilmour is a bit reluctant to do it at the moment), another documenting DG and company in Los Angeles (funny stuff) and the other is the OAI EPK with some different bits as opposed to the original one on the internet) and pieces from the Mermaid Theater concert from March 7, 2006. Also Island Jam 2007 is included recorded at Gilmour's home in Sussex, England. "Dark Globe" is also included and some Easter Eggs that I cannot give away and you will have to see to find out.This DVD is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

$REVIEW.: Interesting and entertaining enough to watch Halle Berry, Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving, and a host of other wonderful actors portray a multitude of characters, interwoven into one story that spans half a millennium. It falls a little short in that the connection between the stories never reaches any profound conclusion; we see how they are related, but the total impact is never fulfilled. Aside from that, the other pitfall is the departure from the traditional arc, when the film fails to reach a climax.

$review_text.: Great serialized plot, although somewhat different to Jules Verne's novel.Capt Nemo is presented as a hidden recluse, toying with the island's castaways, using them as subjects for his rather pointless twisted experiments, all recorded with introductory phrase "Modification of human behaviour experiment number ..."There is no escape from the island in the last episode, only betrayal, as the plot diverges as far as possible from the novel, possibly to pave the way for a second season. Though none was made.Alan Scarf plays Capt Cyrus Harding to perfection, only a few years before his great performance in time travel sci-fi series "Seven Days."If you're a Jules Verne fan, get these great prints, and enjoy.

$REVIEW.: I was so worried that the second offering would be a repetition of the first volume
 If that happened, the whole cinematic experience would become lame


 If you could remember the first volume, it was depicted in many styles and I was happy to inform you all that the second volume was a continuation of that

 Quentin said it well that whilst first volume was paying homage to the Eastern elements and second volume was paying homage to the Western elements
 The soundtrack was done by Robert Rodriquez (of Marichi's fame) and it fitted this movie very well


 For (violent) movie enthusiasts, I couldn't say this enough, this movie was made by someone who was passionate about his craft!  For those that missed Quentin's dialogues as we witnessed in Pulp Fiction, we gotta see heaps in this offering

 As David Carradine explained in the behind-the-scene, Quentin's movies were never about violence but providing us with an insight of how bad people ticked

 Thus, his willingness to partake in this project


 Gordon Liu was back second time around to play Pai-Mei (a bad arse kung-fu master who taught the Bride her martial arts skill)

 This movie contained a lot of surprises like cameo appearances by the least expected persons, additional footage if you are willing to wait to the VERY end of credits, and we got to find out the real name of the Bride's name!  Highly enjoyable and truly watchable

 You would be crazy to miss this one
 Strictly for the Quentin's fans only

$REVIEW.: Donal Logue (Sean Finnerty of Grounded For Life) plays a heavyweight ladies man who is well read in the classics particularly eastern philosophy which he uses to rationalize his lifestyle. He and his friends divide the world into Steve's (the cool guys) and Stu's (the gomers) and have some witty exchanges around this.Logue's character lives a stoner existence and is having an affair with a friend's wife until he inevitably meets the woman who changes his perspective and he falls in love.This is a very entertaining romantic comedy with several engaging characters and it is beautifully filmed in the Santa Fe area.Logue is believably shallow but still likeable in the lead role.

$REVIEW.: Great movie for anyone who can sympathize with a boy who can't grow up.  Some dialog was not taken from Barrie's novel, but it fit in perfectly.  "Sir, you offend reason.  I should like to offend it with you!"  Its a heartwarming family film featuring several young, nearly undressed, athletic boys.  Some moments really layed the love story on thick, and even alluded to some inappropriate content (Peter and Wendy both look down, roughly in the area of Peter's midsection, then smile at each other).  Either way, the DVD has an alternate ending that is less sad than the theatrical ending, but I prefer the original.  Kids don't seem to appreciate as much as adults do, perhaps because a small amount of the language is complex (read: British).  Overall a great film that brings out the kid in everyone.

$REVIEW.: For those of you who are old enough to remember what watching TV at Christmas time was like back in the 50's, 60's, 70's and even 80's, this DVD will surely bring back a lot of incredible memories


 I can clearly remember waiting patiently each year for Bob Hope's Annual Christmas Special on NBC
 This DVD did not disappoint me in anyway
 There is footage of various skits with Bob Hope and just about every famous celebrity of that era


Even the bonus material containing a number of bloopers was great to watch.Back in those days, there were only three stations or three networks to watch (ABC, CBS and NBC), but it seemed that there was always something great on TV, no matter what night of the week it was
 NBC was lucky enough to have Bob Hope for so many incredible years

 I truly have to applaud Bob Hope for entertaining our troops each and every year at Christmas and this DVD has quite a few memorable clips from the 50's through the 80's of Bob in some foreign Country with a great looking gal, parading around on the stage


If you are a fan of Bob Hope, or you'd like to experience just one more of Bob Hope's Annual Christmas Specials, then do NOT pass up this unique opportunity


 I assure you that you will NOT be disappointed

As far as the quality is concerned, it's not HD but it's still pretty darn good, even on a 55" screen.I have already watched this DVD two nights in a row and I will probably play it again some night before Christmas this year
 This is clearly one of my favorite DVD's of all time.

$review_text.: After reading some other reviews and due to the fact the whole concert was not on this release, I had just about made up my mind not to buy this. After watching my old VHS copy the other night, I changed my mind. I'm glad I did. The bonus disc in this release makes it very worth the money. Pennebaker's interviews with the band were priceless. The changes that each of the members have gone through over the years really made you realize how much time had passed. I can't believe it's been 15 years! Dave has settled down, Martin looks like the average family man and Fletch, well, is still Fletch. Ironically I even enjoyed the interviews with the tour bus kids. I agreed with Martin that at first I didn't really care for them in the film (I hated how I had to fast forward through the tape all the time), now I see some of the value it did add. The bonus concert feature is still heavily edited, but we are treated to 'Somebody' and 'Pleasure Little Treasure' (notice how some girl storms up on stage and races at Dave). If you still find yourself wanting to skip all the escapades, it will come in handy.The only negatives I found were, for one, the picture quality of the movie was somewhat grainy. My VHS copy has a better picture. Also of course, we don't get the show from start to finish, and probably never will. Blows my mind how such important footage could be lost forever. At least we will always have the CD release and like someone else said, we get about 80% of the concert. I would also add I am disappointed Alan didn't take part. I've always admired and respected his work, especially with the band. I think this was a tad petty. At least he should tell people why.At any rate kudos to Chris and D.A. for their hard work in making all this happen. True Depeche Mode fans should be grateful.

The story is engrossing and the Jim Henson puppet creations are odd and exceptional. Was the reverend a pedophile? Or does the attention that he lavishes on "Alice" represent a deeper connection? Might one go so far as to call it love? Whatever your conclusion - you will love this now-nearly-forgotten gem!

$review_text.: This is one of the better zombie movies. What could have made it even better was more attention to either of the potential romantic couples: the black gang boy and his friends' sister or the young cop and the Hispanic gang leaders' girlfriend. More attention should have been given to either and one couple should have survived. The chemistry between the young cop and the Hispanic lady came to late in the movie. The chemistry between the black gangster and his friends' sister did not go anywhere. Blossoming love, even in a B-level zombie movie always adds to the quality. There was too much profanity. I love the fact that this zombie movie was in the "hood". I also liked the fact that the zombies looked more than like people with flour splashed on their face, but not their necks, and dark eye shadow painted on. The script was not the best, but this was one of the better zombie movies. I will definately watch this one again. With very little tweeking this one could have been a -4-. I hope the dead  will rise again, only with a little more romance and a little less profanity.

$REVIEW.: Before Jane Fonda got America to its feet with exercise-in-your- home videotape series, the only serious participants were dancers, athletes or the very experienced exercisers.In this video, her core exercise group seems to be those very fit and trim people who had exercised to sustain their body for their profession.It is very clear to say that Jane Fonda's early videos, like this one, Complete Workout, Easy Workout, Prime Time Fitness, Workout With Weights, and the tough Jane Fonda Challenge Workout are all very good workouts.  These were done prior to the massive surge of competition that flooded the market, where everybody sold an exercise video.Hence, Fonda's later videos suffered in quality!  Those being:  Lean Routine, Step Workout, Lower Body Solution, etc.The Baby of 'em AllThis 1982 classic video is the baby of 'em all.  The video comes in two sections, Beginners - 30 minutes and  Advanced - 60 minutes.In her warm-up, she even does jumping jacks also with great stretching routines, and you will see movements that today's exercise gurus don't do anymore.  If you are new to exercising, you will feel the pain.The basis of this workout is certain repetitive movements that focus on single muscle groups against the resistence of your own body weight.Fonda works with every part of the body, from deep stretching to great waist work, grueling crunches, tendon stretches and serious deep lunges.  She uses repetitive counts for each segment.  At times, her voice overdubs the program to give advice and offer proper techniques while working out.This is a tough workout, and if you are serious for strenuous workouts, and if you desire to improving your fitness regime, do this workout.  And get the companion book "Jane Fonda Workout Book"Then, try the Jane Fonda Challenge Workout, it has a very challenging aerobic section that is even tougher.  .....Rizzo

$REVIEW.: If you have owned a television set in the last several decades you have heard or come across episodes of "The Flintstones", one of the very first animated cartoons ever broadcast on American network TV. Originally airing in the early sixties on ABC from 1960-1966, "The Flintstones" has a place in American pop culture forever and thanks to timeless reruns and the advent of DVD these exceptional shows will live on in posterity. This beautiful set contains all 166 shows of the series run, restored with exceptional audio and video clarity. You will find the original openings of the show's first two seasons in this set, an opening that was ultimately replaced on all subsequent syndicated airings with the more popular opening from season three and on. However, what you won't find are the rare cigarette commercials certain characters did from the original network airings in which tobacco companies sponsored the show. "The Flintstones" never left the top 30 of all network shows during its first three years and it went on to enjoy immense success in syndication and eventually the DVD market, spawning theatrical features as well. This set contains some neat bonuses, including the original pilot of the series called "The Flagstones", as well as interviews with those who worked behind the scenes on the making of this television treasure. Sit back and enjoy Fred, Wilma, Barney, Betty, Dino, Pebbles, and Bam-Bam forever in the comfort of your own home without the hassels of TV commercials.

Others have already touched on the mediocre story and predictable "coincidences". I haven't read through all of the reviews so maybe someone else has mentioned this problem. Basically, as of this review, the voices/sound of the actors on the dvd is horrible. It's as though they ran out of money so they couldn't afford to overdub the actors voices and simply went with the sound that was recorded in the scene no matter how bad it was, ie; reverb, echos, barely audible, etc. I gave it 3 stars just because I love Stargate and the actors, but it's sad to think they are ending these adventures with this substandard last entry.

$REVIEW.: Another low-fat review by yours truly. A truly weird and amusing film, made better by the fact that the characters plausibly accept the completely weird world they occupy. A puppeteer finds a gateway into John Malkovich's head on the 7.5th floor of his office building? The film deserves an award just for the industrial-strength suspension of belief it achieves. Now, the gist: 1. Acting rocks, uniformly. Whoever did the pupeteering for J. Cusack deserves worldwide fame. Was it special effects or was it real puppets? I don't know, but I REALLY thought the puppets were something special, literally. As metaphor - they work. 2. Plot - whatever you think you know, you're probably right, but it does work, somehow. 3. Special effects / production design / cinematography - Works well. The 7.5th floor set is very amusing (I'm a cubicle-bound trog, so I'm biased). Most noteworthy - the "Malkovich in his own head" scene. I wake up in a cold sweat just thinking about it. Finally, the key issue - you can take a date or friend to see it. It is weird enough to be interesting, but not weird enough to put off the average multiplex-goer with a reasonable tolerance for something "different." Art-house lite, if you will. You can think about this film, or not, and enjoy it either way. In a nutshell - rent it first.

$review_text.: This is an excellent compilation of four History Channel/A&E; programs dealing with Christmas, all wrapped into one DVD.1. "Christmas Unwrapped" (available as an individual DVD) is a delightful history of the holiday from pagan times to the present, along with the origins of several Christmas customs.2. "It's a Wonderful Time to be Weird" is a holiday offering from the popular series WEIRD U.S. where the odd and unusual are documented from coast-to-coast.  It's a Wacky Wonderland of Christmas.3. "Santa Claus" (available as an individual DVD) is from the BIOGRAPHY series and traces the roots of Father Christmas through the centuries.4. "Christmas Tech" is a holiday episode of the series MODERN MARVELS that explores the high-tech aspect of the celebration, such as the annual Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and Macy's festive store windows.Getting these four programs for less than the price of either one of the previous individual releases, is 2008 holiday bargain.I'd recommend enjoying each program individually, rather than sitting through a Christmas overdose of 200 minutes.  However, as a big fan of all things Christmas, I found the four flowed quite nicely all in a row.These are rarely found in stores, so have Amazon put this DVD in Santa's sleigh this holiday season.

$REVIEW.: Evan (Wes Bentley), an apparently unemotional introvert who appears to lack any feelings, makes his living writing suicide notes. He also likes to attend the funerals of those who have used his services. This is where he meets Charlotte (Winona Ryder), the attractive sister of one of his clients. Having no idea as to his connection with her brother, she becomes fascinated with him and eventually romantically passionate about him. While he resists her advances for quite some time, eventually he succumbs and they become romantically involved, that is, until she discovers what he does for a living as well as his connection with her brother while going through his papers at his apartment.Comic relief is provided by a client (played by Ray Romano) who thinks he wants to commit suicide but never finds what Evan writes for him satisfactory because, well, he has too much to live for to commit suicide just yet.Although the premise that someone would be able to make a living writing suicide notes is implausible, if you can get beyond this, it's a great movie. Evan's transformation from a complete and misanthropic introvert to a person with passion and character as he becomes romantically involved with Charlotte is entirely believable and really quite charming.

$REVIEW.: The first time I saw this film, I knew I was in love.Howl's Moving Castle follows the story of Sophie Hatter, the eldest daughter of the Hatters who starts to work at her father's hat shop after his death

Her life in the hat shop is closed off, and restraining her potential, but she gets an opportunity to go out into the world after she is cursed by the Witch of the Waste

Her only hope to get rid of this curse is to get help from the frightening Wizard Howl who eats girl's hearts.As in all Studio Ghibli films, the scenery is magnificent and Miyazaki portrays many different types of places such as busy cities, lone country side, and the deserted Waste


What I most enjoyed from this film is the themes that it has

As the eldest child, Sophie thinks of others, and has low confidence in herself and her looks, but upon meeting Howl and becoming entangled in a magical battle, she gains courage and grows to love herself and Howl as well
Another theme portrayed is that of not running away from the past


In order for Howl to truly be free, he has to stop running away and face his curse

Howl and Sophie, both cursed must find a solution to be as they once were and in doing that, they become happier and even stronger than before


Both previously been lost and doubting themselves, they become whole and like two halves, they come together in one of the most heart-pounding Studio Ghibli romance stories ever!I love this film, that I cannot tell you how many times I have seen it


I recently read the book and it was equally as great
In short, the story is just amazing and Howl will melt your heart as well!

$REVIEW.: Everyone who's written reviews below about "Earl" talk about how funny the show is, and it certainly is hysterically, laugh-out-loud, funny, featuring terrific dialogue and genius timing. But no one's mentioned that every episode is also quietly moving and elegant in its structure, without ever feeling forced or preachy. In every episode, thanks to Earl's good deeds, everyone gets what they deserve, good triumphs over evil (or over just stupid and venal) in a structure as elegant as any on t.v. The show's a marvel, and its ability to move from screwball farce to gently moral tale takes it from solid craft into the realm of true art. If it can't be sustained for years and years, let's just be grateful for Season 1.

$review_text.: This is an interesting movie that explores the concepts of capitol punishment. The movie claims to be neutral, but it does seem to be against it.Very quickly, Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) is visiting Sean Penn who is sentenced to die for having a part in killing 2 teenagers. Sarandon tries to be compassionate, but she realizes that Penn at the very least has issues. She is trying to get Penn to believe in Jesus (seeing that his days are numbered). Penn denies responsibility for the deaths of the teenagers, so Sarandon does everything within her power to see that he gets fair chances of appeals. Needless to say, the parents of the victims just want Penn executed. (This begins an interesting subplot that will come full circle.)Penn may have gotten some miles in his pleas, but he makes the DUMB mistake of praising Adolf Hitler on television. Granted, innocent people have been arrested and executed, but Penn has now shown his 'issues' on television for all to see. Needless to say, Sarandon is annoyed.Perhaps due to Penn's acting abilities, we come to care about his character despite his crimes and mental issues. We then see that his execution is inevitable, and Sarandon has to go through the difficult job of being at Penn's side to the end. The methods of execution start to look cold and calculating. And we start to wonder what gives us the right to take the life of even a criminal. We can see that Sarandon gets little help from those she should. While the Prison Chaplain coldly says: "The Old Testament says 'an eye for an eye,' Sarandon bitterly counters it: "What about the NEW Testament where Jesus says: 'A man is greater than his worst sin?'"There is some release of tension as Penn has a moment with his family. Once he confesses his guilt, the writer does not allow our newly won sympathy for Penn to slack for a moment. It will in fact increase right up until the end. Sarandon's arguably strongest moment is when she tells Penn to just keep his eyes on her face as sentence is carried out. In a way, Penn does have a final triumphant moment when he can honestly say: "Killing is wrong, whether it's me who does it, or your government." In other words, Penn has shown his executioners as well as others that they have become what they accused him of being.If you are for capitol punishment, you are probably not going to like this movie. But if you are against it, you probably will like it a lot despite its profound sadness.

$REVIEW.: A look from the other sideNetwork TV likes to show war at a distance--smoke billowing from a distant hillside, a devastated apartment block, burned out vehicles - but rarely deals with the loss of the people on the ground


"Under the Bombs" is an exercise in changing the dynamic, showing what life is like for one Lebanese family during the war of 2006

The story is simple - a distraught mother is looking for her lost child, and is aided by a taxi driver who will help her for cash
 Inevitably, the characters learn to sympathize with each other as they navigate the desolate, war-blasted landscape following clues, dodging militias and beseeching foreign aid workers.Telling much more than this would spoil the plot
But "Under the Bombs" shows situations and characters that are believable and that tug the heartstrings

Tony is a man's man, by turns brooding angel and horndog


Zeina is a mother focused on finding her son, but also beset by the guilt of her divorce
Together, they drive along the thin edge of hope and hopelessness, attempting to find small victories in a sea of death, despair and confusion


His is not a political movie, except that it shows that Muslim Lebanese as sympathetic and human

A well-crafted and deeply affecting film.

$REVIEW.: After watching the TV trailers for this film, I had absolutely no interest in it. They emphasized the scene in the library which made this movie look just like any of dozens of pseudo sci-fi "fight the monsters in the dark" films. I've enjoyed some films of that type but after 30+ years they've worn thin by now.Just for the heck of it, my wife and I just watched this on streaming video and found a VERY different film than expected. With a few action scenes worked in here and there, this is actually a very thoughtful and surprising post-apocalyptic sci-fi story.Set about 70 years in the future, the Earth has reportedly won a war with alien invaders by resorting to the nuclear option. The relatively few people left have abandoned Earth to live on Titan (a large moon of Jupiter), and the few people left hanging around are protecting large machines that are generating needed power for the colony by sucking up the Earth's oceans.Tom Cruise plays Jack, one of these survivors whose job is to repair weaponized drones which protect the power generating machines. Along with a female partner, they spend their nights in a luxurious base and their days working to find and repair drones downed by the remnants of the invading army.The surprises in this film won't be shocking for highly experienced sci-fi fans, but their gradual revelation makes for a very intriguing and very thoughtful story. Jack's increasing self-awareness and his struggle to arrive at the truth is a fascinating story which is 180 degrees different than the movie suggested by the ads ... and trust me that's a GOOD thing! :-)Well, any more than this and I'd be getting to spoiler territory ... as if there likely aren't hundreds of reviews with spoilers out there anyway. LOL I'll just say that we found this to be an excellent film with plot twists that kept us guessing for quite some time. Cruise leads a cast full of the excellent acting performances that drive this first rate plot.The special effects are clean and convincing. The HD streaming version looks great, although the dialogue at times seems to be a bit low compared to the surrounding ambient noise and audio effects.Highly recommended.

$review_text.: I think it's important to judge movies (or books or anything else really) not based on what I want them to be, but what they are attempting to be. And that's particularly relevant here.Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not a direct adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved children's story The Hobbit.  And if that's what you want, you will be disappointed.This is a prequel to the movie trilogy The Lord of the Rings. Something that became apparent within the first 15 minutes of the movie. It's clearly framed as that. If you didn't like those movies... you won't like this one.It is not a stand alone story. If you want something that is complete in and of itself... you won't like this movie.On the other hand. If you enjoyed The Lord of the Rings movies and you like spending time in that vision of Middle-earth there's no reason why you wouldn't enjoy the prequel. Visually this is clearly the same place and while the tone is lighter you can see how it would progress to the darkness of LOTR.A lot has been made of the fact that a small children's book has been turned into three movies. To be honest I always thought it would need two in order to be done thoroughly. Because the Hobbit at some 320 pages (depending on the version you have) is not actually that short. Most movies if directly transcribed would really only make up a short story.One of the pleasures of An Unexpected Journey was that everything was there. It was frustrating to me in the Lord of the Rings movies that so much had to be either skipped or rushed (and I'm not even talking about Tom Bombadil who I don't particularly care for). That isn't a problem here.In fact the humor and lightness of The Hobbit is actually present in the film, particularly in the earlier scenes. Complete with songs. And yes we get Dwalin, Balin, Dori, Ori, Nori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur, Fili and Kili and of course Thorin Oakenshield all introduced in suitable and largely comic fashion.And it's a huge credit that despite the huge number of dwarves, many of who are not terribly distinctive even in the original text and who in some cases only get a few lines of their own, each of them does seem quite distinctive.But what Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boyens have done is to blend those lighter elements into the grimmer back story. We get to see what was going on while Gandalf was not with the dwarves. And this isn't just made up. It is based solidly on the material in the appendices from The Lord of the Rings. I should know, I read them often enough.Perhaps that is why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did. I love that material and I loved the time it got here. I loved that they were able to finally slot Radagast in after he was removed from the original trilogy.Speaking of Radagast the Brown, he had some of my favorite moments in the movie despite that being perhaps the biggest stretch from any actual Tolkien text. Yeah maybe they over-egged the drug user references with both the pipe-weed sequence and the mushrooms comment, but Sylvester McCoy honestly did some of his finest work in this movie.By this point the Tolkien purists will be ready to strangle me I'm sure. But this was not a movie for the purist.Tolkien in fact would have hated it. But then I suspect he hated most movies. He disliked technology, he didn't like noise and generally speaking he was a grumpy stick in the mud. And the movie wasn't made for him either.The introduction of the additional material actually helps the narrative considerably. In truth The Hobbit is a story about a bunch of random events that are tied together with references to luck and fate. By emphasizing the back story we get an enemy and something driving the plot forward.There are some liberties taken with characterization. Probably less than in The Lord of the Rings but the dwarves in general and Thorin in particular are less incompetent than they were in the book.The same is true of Bilbo here who by the end of the movie actually stands up for himself.The party are still heavily dependent on Gandalf to arrive in the nick of time and save the day. But you do get the feeling that if he hadn't they would have gone down fighting rather than totally ineffectually.What you're getting here isn't a children's movie. It's a modern action movie. Complete with scenes that might have appeared in a video game. Jackson's signature swooping camera is very much in evidence and the scale of the sets is huge.In terms of acting, Ian McKellan is of course always brilliant. And of the dwarves Kenn Stott as Balin in particular just nails his role. In fact if I had seen this first I would have been much more affected by the tomb scene in Fellowship of the Ring because you can feel a connection between Balin and Bilbo and you can see why he's respected.James Nesbit as Bofur, Aidan Turner as Kilie and Richard Armitage as Thorin all excel in their roles as well. And of course there is Andy Serkis returning to the role of Gollum.The Riddles in the Dark sequence is another of my favorite bits in the movie. A tense sequence that blends comedy and tension right down to the ending.Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!Which brings me nicely to Bilbo Baggins himself. As portrayed by Martin Freeman. Freeman gets to use his comedic chops throughout the movie, but also has to dig a bit deeper for some scenes. And while some of his mannerism, the same ones we saw in The Office and Sherlock are there, within the first 40 minutes I was watching Bilbo on screen, not Martin Freeman.Which brings me on to time. This is a long movie. The running time is 169 minutes. So almost 3 hours. I can see that in the cinema I might have found that too much. But sitting in the comfort of home with the ability to stop whenever I wanted to get a drink or use the bathroom, I had no trouble with the length at all. The movie kept me interested the whole time.So where does that leave us?I loved the movie. Enjoyed all of it. Purists will hate it. People who just wanted The Hobbit will hate it.  Some people may well find it too long and just not be as interested in the Middle-earth background as I am.

$REVIEW.: The film continues to shed light on (the very well known by now) Harry Potter, as he attends his fifth year at Hogwarts
 As his powers are growing and the mystery surrounding his true purpose in life still evades us, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher proves to be much more than most can handle, disrupting Harry's already fragile state of mind in the process...Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with strong elements of fantasy, not to mention some very witty humor.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, David Thewlis, Alan Rickman (!), Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.The concept, the plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music, are all EXCELLENT!  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is guaranteed to provide a great deal of entertainment
 In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over


 In short, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection when it becomes available!

$REVIEW.: Recorded less than two years before his untimely death, this is Bob in all his glory. Full of energy and spirituality, Bob commands the stage with his timeless music and lasting message of hope, faith, unity, and equality. His accompanying band, The Wailers are also in fine form, and the audience is very involved with the performance and adds greatly to the atmosphere.The songs featured a veritable mixture of Bob classics with a few rarer numbers thrown in. Among the highlights are the opening "Positive Vibration," a powerful "I Shot The Sheriff," a lively "Africa Unite," a passionate "One Drop," a bouncy "So Much Things To Say," the legendary "Jammin'," a beautiful "Is This Love," a nosstalgic "Stir It Up," and a fiery "Get Up, Stand Up," among others. The major high point however, is the blistering rendition of "Exodus," perform with a soulfulness and energy not heard even on the album version. Bob also performs several songs from what would be his final album, "Survival," all of which he performs beautifully.The dvd comes with several bonus features that are a t reat for Marley fans. The booklet, with liner notes by Chris Salewicz, is a very detailed behind the scenes look at the show as well as the tour, and is beautifully written. There's several bonus features on the dvd. The documentary "Prophecies & Messages" is a great archival look at Bob, Salewicz gives a nice video interview, we get a bonus performance, "War / No More Trouble," an interview fans at Bob's November 27, 1979 show at The Roxy Theatre in L.A. to benefit The Sugar Ray Robinson foundation, and an interview with Wailers keyboardist Tyrone Downie about Rastafarianism.This dvd is an excellent look at Bob and his impact on the word as well as his fans. It is a must for all fans of Bob, his music and his message.

$review_text.: on the surface, Astronaut Farmer appears to be ordinary wholesome family fare (though rated PG, not G, because of one gory scene)

 yet, scoop away the corn pone, and it is as subversive a movie as i have seen in the past 30 or more years.imagine an American-made film depicting an intact nuclear family in which the white male father is neither molesting his children, nor physically or emotionally abusing his wife, nor a drunk, addict, philanderer, or even a compulsive gambler


 (alright, at one point he is diagnosed as clinically insane, but let's not quibble.)  as if that were not implausible enough, he's a southerner -- indeed, a *Texan!*  (had he been, say, a working class Italian American with no connection, of any sort, to the Mob, it would have pushed the envelope of credulity beyond the tearing point.)the first question one might ask would be:  how could such a project ever get financed in the first place?  aside from a nutcase such as Mel Gibson, who would risk capital on such an implausible premise?  as it turns out, this indie project is, in part, a vehicle for two child actors, Jasper and Logan Polish, who are daughters of this film's writers, producers, directors Mark and Michael Polish (additionally, Mark plays an FBI agent on screen)
 i guess there's nothing like putting your own daughters in your film to motivate an 'unorthodox' perspective on fatherhood.perhaps what made this otherwise impossible premise acceptable by Hollywood PC standards were two (otherwise completely gratuitous) auto-de-fe's by the father (Billy Bob Thornton, who is actually from Arkansas, not Texas -- but let's not get carried away)

 in the first, he speechifies to a committee of officious Washington bureaucrats who wickedly want to stop a private citizen from launching a manned Atlas rocket from his backyard, words to the effect, ~if another country tried to land men on the moon, the US would probably declare war on them~

 (the last i read, Japan and China have such ambitions; but, so far, there are no plans for war with either country on Dick Cheney's desk
 [come to think of it, cross your fingers.])in the other genuflection to the Hollywood Left, Thornton, responding to a rumor that violent force will be used by the US government to prevent his launch, says something like, ~they're pretty good at killing people with dreams.~  (conspiracy theories, anyone?)the ever-radiant Virginia Madsen (why hasn't her career been at least as big as, for example, Jessica Lange's?) plays Thornton's wife, who stands by her man
 Bruce Dern is, as always, convincing -- in his role as Madsen's father.bring the kids

 if none are handy, bring the kid inside yourself.

$REVIEW.: While I wouldn't call this a great movie, it is highly original and definitely has some memorable moments, including the sacrificial temple scene.  Mel does a very good job of capturing the savagery of the times, and his actors are all quite believable in their roles.  It's not an historical epic film in the sense that it only depicts the fictional story of a small group of people over a short period of time in Mayan history, rather than giving a broad overview of the decline of the Mayan civilization.  In this sense, it is similar to Mel's Passion of the Christ, which took place just over a few days or hours.  Both are highly creative and original movies.

$REVIEW.: I just adore this movie. Great acting, sweet story, lots of culture and absolutely fabulous music... I listen to the soundtrack all the time.Barbara Streisand is perfect at playing an intelligent, yet vulnerable  woman in a time and place in which women were supposed to be illiterate and  considered to be silly. Her father was a more forward-thinking man in a  culture that considered teaching a woman to read something perverse and  criminal. When her father dies,she loses everything... women can't read,  own property or make decisions concerning the course of her life.She  decides that her persuit of knowledge of the holy scriptures is too  important to let the opportunity slip through her fingers, so she cuts her  hair and lives life as a male Rabbinical student. Life takes a twist she  doesn't expect when she falls for her classmate and subsequently is forced  to marry a young girl.There are a lot of laughing-out-loud moments, but  this is mostly just an extremely sweet story of love, sacrifice, tradition  and freedom. It's definitely a feel-good movie that will put a lump in your  throat. I highly recommend this film.

$review_text.: If you have not yet seen 'Once Upon a Time...' I envy you. It's probably my number 1 favorite Western of all times. So that you can weigh my opinion, I add 'Lonesome Dove', 'Tombstone', 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', and 'My Darling Clementine' to round out a top 5 list of Westerns to have with you if trapped on a desert island and you must watch them over and over. If they gave me 5 more it would likely be the remake of 'True Grit', 'Open Range', 'Stagecoach', 'The Magnificent 7', or any of the other Wyatt Earp movies except 'Wyatt Earp's Revenge'. I suppose 'Unforgiven' should be on the list, but I have never been able to see what others see in that movie. Have patience with me... I'm also a sci-fi aficionado, yet it took many viewings of Bladerunner before I really got locked in.What you are about to see is the ultimate 'revenge movie' in a western setting. If you have ever seen Sharon Stone's revenge flick 'The Quick and the Dead', fuggedaboutit. Spaghetti Western director Sergio Leone holds court on how to properly serve up this genre in 'Once Upon a Time...'.Here are some things to know about the movie up front without spoiling it for you:1) It's a bit slow. This is NOT Short Attention Span Theater. The pace of the movie is deliberately slow. It's more like eating a simmered roast than a minute steak. Have a beer or a bowl or whatever to let yourself synch down to the pace of the film.2) Every character in 'Once Upon a Time...' has their own music. Famous composer Ennio Marricone scores this epic film and endows every character with the exact right music to set the appropriate mood. Much of this film is about the score, so tune in and enjoy the ride.3) If you get confused as to what the hell is going on in the movie don't worry. It's not atypical on the first time through. To help with that, don't assume all the apparent bad guys are in fact all bad, and don't worry if there appear to be NO good guys for quite some time. It all works out most deliciously.4) There is an early scene where the Italian beauty Claudia Cardinale walks into the railroad station after disembarking the train. A crane shot follows her into the station and then seamlessly tracks up above the station to reveal the town she has arrived in. It is a breathtaking shot with Claudia's character music blaring. An unforgettable moment! Sergio Leone had the town extensively built for this one single shot.5) The DVD has one of the best commentary tracks I've ever heard. It not only explains the movie, it explains "the western".Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: Joel McCrea is one of Hollywood's most underrated actors. Like his contemporary with whom he is often associated, Randy Scott, he greatly enjoyed making Westerns. And he made some very good ones. While THE GUNFIGHT AT DODGE CITY doesn't rank with RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY or perhaps with some of McCrea's earlier work with Universal-International, it is a solid and enjoyable oater which repays re-watching. It is well cast and nicely filmed. Let's hope that this release will signal additional releases of McCrea Westerns....CATTLE DRIVE, SADDLE TRAMP, BORDER RIVER, STRANGER ON HORSEBACK....

$review_text.: The 1975 version of Edgar Rice Burroughs' "The Land that Time Forgot / The People that Time Forgot (Midnite Movies Double Feature)" with Doug McClure featured lame puppet-type dinosaurs, but made up for it with well-developed characters and a huge subtext, which was surprising for such a seemingly simple story.This made-for-TV 2009 version changes everthing and I'm sort of glad because we already have the original that followed Burroughs' book pretty faithfully. The only similarity between this version and Burroughs' story is that there's an uncharted island, castaways, Germans, a U-boat and dinosaurs. That's it. This version features some sort of dimensional gateway where modern people and others from the last century meet on Caprona, the island. They try to figure out how to escape, how to get along and how to contend with dinosaurs, mostly a T-rex. Speaking of which, the T-rex doesn't look too bad for this type of micro-budget sci-fi, just don't expect "Jurassic Park" quality (although the story's arguably better).C. Thomas Howell directed the film and is also a member of the likable cast. I appreciate the camaraderie that develops between the Americans and the Germans. Speaking of which, the WWI Germans are pretty convincing.As far as women go, Lindsey McKeon is the highlight as a shapely brunette, but there's also a good-looking blond (Anya Benton).FINAL WORD: Although it doesn't follow Burroughs' book at all, this 2009 TV version of "The Land that Time Forgot" is a worthwhile lost-on-a-deserted-island flick in the tradition of "Mysterious Island (Widescreen)" and others, like "Planet of the Dinosaurs". If you enjoy movies of this ilk, you'll probably appreciate this one.The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, Long Beach and Malibu, CA.GRADE: B-

$review_text.: This isn't really a stand alone movie. It's actually the wrap up for the TV series that SCI FI stupidly cancelled (yet has wrestling, that makes sense). The plot in this movie was actually intended to be the last three episodes of season ten and the first three episodes of season 11. Then the show got cancelled so they held off production and those watching the series never had a wrap-up. What does this mean for the viewer. It means that if you weren't watching the series, you may not get a whole lot out of the movie because it relies heavily on what viewers have been watching for the last 10 seasons. If you're looking for a stand alone wait for the next one.

$review_text.: Before watching this film, I read a critic that called it Oscar bait. I wasn't quite sure what he meant. I suppose people shouting impassioned arguments at each other while holding back tears is what he meant. The thing is, there's nothing new here. There's nothing new about a priest that (possibly) had improper relations with a young altar boy. There's nothing new about the clash of the old ways and new ways in the Church. The only new thing I saw was the great (and short) performance by Viola Davis as she was willing to let quite a lot pass for the sake of her son. Meryl Streep is yet again amazing at keeping in character so that we firmly believe she is a real person and not just a stage character. The movie ends too soon. There is punishingly little understanding from the POV of the young African American child who should be the center of this entire production. The most we get out of him is a few lines and a lot of scowling and sniffling. I wanted to know more about him. How does he feel to be in a an all white school. How does he feel about the Priest, really? How does he feel about his father who beats him. The lack of a climax to the story leaves the viewer a bit underwhelmed and cheated even.The Bronx set (I had no idea where it was. It could have been Boston for all I knew) was great reminiscent of the autumnal images evoked in the Exorcist. I wish there could have been more speculation about the cause of the raging winds in addition to the Priest's low-key speech at the last service in the film.

$review_text.: First, let me say that Spielberg did an outstanding job and this is an important film with great acting.  It is up there among great war films, but ones such as Das Boot, Apocalypse Now, Catch-22, and Full Metal Jacket  still stand out as the tops.  I urge you to check those out first before or  in addition to Saving Private Ryan.I would say that Saving Private  Ryan had impeccable and more realism in the D-Day and battle scenes.  Yet  in a way it detracted from the real suspense and horror of war by just  handing the viewer graphical depictions -- limbs on a silver platter, if  you will.  The other movies I mentioned show the real face of war -- it's  atrocities and absurdities.  While the plot of Saving Private Ryan dances  around those things also, I believe it gets buried in the audio and video  technological wizardry.  It becomes a case of &quot;less is more&quot; in  my opinion.

$REVIEW.: SpoilersSpoilersSpoilersDays of darkness is a surprising good low budget zombie flick.  It has group that is isolated and barricaded in trying to survive, and there are antagonist between the survivors leading to hot tempers and flared rivalries.  The movie also has  some "night of the comet" action thrown in, where everyone that was drinking or had alcohol when the comet hit were immune to the zombiefication process.The reason everyone turns into zombies is also a unique perspective, because of alien organism and parasitic entities that attach themselves to the host taking over the host and going on a zombie killing spree to propagate the alien species.All in all i find this movie a decent zombie flick and better than a slew of others on the market, and props have to go to the makers of the movie for thinking outside the zombie box and  bypassing the usual cookie cutter zombie checklist that makes up the usual movie.

$REVIEW.: "Sherlock" impressed me. It has a brilliant cast, and amazing dialogue, plot, and photography.  The creators' ideas put unique spins on the show while still remaining in line with Conan's intent.  If you are a real Holmes fan, the frequent (and sometimes humorous) nods will be fun to see.The second season is even better than the first, in terms of writing and filming.  The character of Sherlock is fascinating and well-played; the humor is sly and surprising; the scenery and sets are gorgeous.  Certain parts--especially the scene at Buckingham Palace and the cunning sequence between the Irene Adler's living room and the moor--stand out for their amazing photography, while the rooftop/phone call/season ending was so tense and heart-wrenching it held me spellbound.  I had to watch it twice.As usual, the characters are fun and compelling--I especially enjoy dear Mrs. Hudson and sweet, sweet Molly; while the normal, "mundane" but enjoyable characters of John and Lestrade nicely balance Sherlock's quirkiness.  The partnership between Sherlock Holmes and Watson was even more evident this season; each of them had to frequently give up something...time, trust, and more...to keep their friendship going.  Both John and Sherlock make each other angry from time to time, but in the end (literally), John remains unshakably loyal and Sherlock turns from his philosophy ("Alone protects me") to adopt John's ("Nope: Friends protect people").Every second of this series is utterly enjoyable, and is without a doubt my favorite British show ever.  It is smart and addictive, perfect for fans of mystery thrillers and good drama.  Please, don't miss it!

 The main reason we bought the DVD was as a memento of our trip to Australia
 This adaptation may serve as a way to introduce kids to opera (in the way that The Nutcracker is a good way to introduce kids to ballet)

 It is sung in English, the characters are "clown like" and there are lots of puppets and "flying" birds
 In other words, it is full of fantasy - ideal for children; never the less worth watching.

$REVIEW.: I hadn't seen this award-winning film in decades, and wondered if it would be as good my teenaged memories of it -- but my fears were groundless. While nostalgia certainly colored my viewing, I found it just as moving as I had so many years ago, when I was far less experienced & at an emotionally uncertain age -- not entirely unlike its two protagonists.This sort of story isn't in vogue today. No doubt most filmmakers would be reluctant to touch such a gentle, bittersweet story, since it deals with the relationship between a lonely 12-year old girl & a psychologically wounded 30-year old pilot. I'm afraid the sexually over-saturated atmosphere of contemporary culture would make the story just a little suspect, casting it in predatory terms.That's a shame, because we're in somewhat symbolic territory here, a landscape of the psyche as opposed to the "real" world. In fact, trying to judge this as a completely "realistic" film just doesn't work. It's true that some of the supporting characters are hard to accept as people you or I might know. But they aren't supposed to be, because this is a story of innocence -- its power, its fragility, and how a supposedly more "sensible" world distrusts it, distorts it, and ultimately destroys it.Hardy Kruger is very good as the shattered pilot, but young Patricia Gozzi is even better as the emotionally abandoned little girl. What an expressive face she has! Their relationship is tender, mutually supportive ... yet the director is honest enough to acknowledge a certain erotic undercurrent, where the purity of their love is tinged by something slightly more -- something unspoken, never to be acted upon, but still very real. Again, this would never be acceptable today.Each of the two protagonists is searching for a lost Eden, a redemption that exists in the private bubble of their relationship, a projected ideal each sees in the other ... but their idyll is finally ephemeral & doomed, just as we're all doomed to grow up. The ending is all too predictable & inevitable, of course. Could it really ever have ended any other way?The only drawback is that the film is only available on VHS, in a so-so print. This is crying for restoration & DVD release, as it's too good to be forgotten. Heartbreakingly recommended!

$REVIEW.: While Lucas is a touching story of a boy who wants to impress a girl by changing his image regardless of the fact that nature dictates otherwise, this movie is worth seeing just to stare at Charlie Sheen who is in his teens at the time of this film.  Why is he so beautiful?  N-E way, he is really cool in this movie which only adds to his complete and total hotness.  What I like about this movie is how confident Lucas is. He is a nerd but can he really be described as a nerd? He likes bugs and he is really smart, but he is very confident, not at all a victim, even though his life is a sad and tragic story with a absent mother and alcoholic father that is not seen but only talked about during the film. He lives in a ratty old trailer park and works for a gardner. He is bullied on a regular basis but endlessly fights back against the bullies. In a constant battle to demand his right to exist he finally earns the respect of his peers in a very moving and powerful end.

$REVIEW.: Two sisters, Rose and Maggie, at opposite ends of the spectrum, and life. Rose, high pressure wallflower attorney spends her life caring for beautiful, aimless Maggie, harboring a hidden secret of her own. At first, it harbors the appearance of "chick flick", especially when you find out Shirley MacClaine stars as an aging grandmother who lives in a Florida retirement community. But what Curtis Hanson has crafted is a smart, sharp drama that is compelling, emotional, and wonderful.It could have very easily slipped into becoming a Lifetime movie of the week, but Hanson's expert direction, and the excellent performances, allow this movie room to breathe and grow into a fine ensemble piece. Each performance is nuanced and balanced. The always strong Toni Collette pulls off her role as Rose with rage and understanable heartbreak. Cameron Diaz turns in another surprising turn as Maggie, proving she's more than just a pretty face. The two are magic together. Shirley MacClaine's Ella is understated and brilliant, making her all the more believable.I really enjoyed this movie, and I think you would too.

The whole movie is dependent on the cute smile of B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo, who is delightful, but it takes more than that to make a good movie.

$REVIEW.: I'm too much of a Romero zombie fan to give an objective review so I'll just give my impressions.Despite giving this 4 stars this is a movie that people seem to love or hate so you should try before you buy. If you think that the best romero zombie movie is the first then I think you'll enjoy this. If you think the second one is the best then you I'm not so sure.This movie seems to follow the Night of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead mold where there's more character development but not as much action as in Dawn and Land of the Dead. This is a plus in my eyes considering that most of the recent zombie movies seem to follow the Dawn of the Dead mold as seen in the remake and in the 28 series. If you have different taste however you'll probably be left wanting for more.The special effects where very good and work despite the fact that Romero starts goofing around in some scenes as usual. Thankfully he decided to not do something as ridiculous as the elastic zombie in Land of the Dead.The one big negative I see is that the movie looks too clean for its own good. Had this movie been made earlier with old school grainy film I could bet that it would get a cult following from people who think the original NOTLD is the best movie in the series. Unfortunately the crisp visuals can make follwing the movie distracting and some people just won't be able to relax and let themselves be entertained.

I'll even address their complaints in my own non-reviewIts not Tsuburaya releasing it: They had NO interest in releasing their shows in the US(at least at an affordable price), so if they had to lose a lawsuit for me to finally get some subtitled releases SO BE IT!There is a missing episode: it was banned in Japan so it was not included in the masters. This ep was shown dubbed on TNT so you can buy a bootleg if you want to see that one ep.Its not dubbed: Boo effing hoo.Shout has done a great job with the treatment of other TV shows and I suggest that fans support this release. I started watching the fan subbed versions of this show and its really good, not a silly or lighthearted as the original could get, but a very cool show.I'll update this with a real review when it comes out, till then I just wanted to counter the Comic Book Guy's and their whining.

Soar among the flying Banshees. Fight alongside Na'vi warriors. Return to Pandora and immerse yourself in the greatest adventure of all time, as one man's quest for redemption leads him on an epic journey beyond imagination!Cast: Sam Worthington, Stephen Lang, Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi, Joel David Moore, Dileep Rao, Zoe Saldana, C.

Regarding the technology used for shooting &#34;AVATAR&#34; in stereoscopic 3D, the Fusion Camera System was used. Having been developed by Vince Pace and James Cameron, their Fusion 3D HD system involves the use of two customized cameras, and reportedly Cameron used a specifically designed system all on its own just for &#34;Avatar&#34;. According to an article in Popular Mechanics, this camera's viewfinder also offered the filmmaker the opportunity to watch the live actors as they are integrated by the system in a provided CG environment, as it senses its position on a motion-capture stage.As for the actual 3D presentation itself found here on the Blu-ray 3D let me discuss lots of great examples -- with timestamps and screenshots -- of scenes that impressed me. It doesn't take but until the 1 minute 15 seconds mark when you'll really start to notice some 3D that stands out like the tiny water droplets floating in Jake`s cryo chamber. 15 seconds later you'll really start to be amazed by the 3D presentation in terms of depth when you get to see the almost visually endless corridor full of other cryo chambers. This is the first instance you'll also notice that the character of focus and objects in the foreground really stand out from the backdrop. The people floating around helping others out of cryo chambers look very cool as well during this sequence and seem to stand out from the backdrop. At the 2 minutes 15 seconds mark the ship coming at you holds lots of depth and pop to it. 45 seconds later the ship really starts to look amazing as it's flying above Pandora which seems as distant in terms of depth as you'd expect. Once the shuttle carrying humans to Pandora departs from the main ship at the 4 minutes 40 seconds mark and approaches for a landing you'll start to notice it stands out and the backdrop has some serious depth to it. It's also at this point that you'll be noticing even more that human characters' silhouettes and other objects stand out from the background -- the interior of the shuttle. 6 minutes or so in when Jake is exiting the shuttle and getting his first look on the ground of &#34;Pandora&#34; you'll be starting to be impressed and get a taste of that to come in terms of the 3D. At the 11 minutes mark the first subtitles to the Na'vi language being spoken will stand out from the background -- making them easier to read. You'll also this point notice that the computer monitors and tablets really stand out in terms of 3D pop. We're only at roughly the 10 minute mark here and it's already starting to look extremely cool. Keep in mind some folks believe that 3D can take up to 10 to 15 minutes before your eyes adjust and start to see it in its full potential. With that being said, let's move on to further timestamps of scenes that I found to be impressive.I could go on and on and on with examples of scenes that impressed me but let me now discuss some particular things that impressed me throughout the film. First off, the reflections on glass and (possibly) plastic surfaces as well as the reflections on water look superb. The sense of depth here is truly breath-taking, at some times more-so than others. Sometimes you'll really almost feel like you're right there in the middle of things thanks to the benefits of this 3D presentation. In fact, this almost seems like a totally different experience in 3D than it ever did in 2D. Just because you're viewing it in 3D behind glasses don't expect things to be overly dim or colours to seem dull, the black level is solid, the colour palette comes across really vibrant and the flesh tones during the live-action shots seem accurate. Objects really stand out here in terms of 3D pop just as you'd expect for a film shot on state of the art 3D stereoscopic cameras. The floating objects really seem to be the stuff that will amaze most viewers such as insect-like creatures and those seeds of the sacred tree which are a highlight of their own. This offers the most consistent and impressive 3D presentation on the Blu-ray 3D format that I have seen to date and I feel totally sets a benchmark in terms of 3D quality that no other release is going to come anywhere close to anytime soon. There's so much in your face intensity here in the last hour of the film it'll leave you astounded. The live-action scenes and CG animated scenes both look great here but obviously the CG scenes are the strongest in terms of the 3D effects.In closing, in regard to the 3D quality on this release, this is hands-down the most impressive title available on the Blu-ray 3D format. This is the reason you bought a 3D display or perhaps what will make you consider buying one. This as I've said countless times with my examples is both jaw-dropping and eye-popping in terms of 3D. Simply put, this is THE title to use as &#34;demo material&#34; to show off your 3D display. As you would expect &#34;AVATAR&#34; on Blu-ray 3D earns itself a perfect unprecedented &#34;5 Star Rating&#34; for overall 3D quality. Let's hope some other titles come out that can come close to looking this amazing in 3D.NOTE: This not only contains a Blu-ray 3D presentation but also a standard 2D presentation that will play as a Blu-ray Disc on a 2D SMART TV display. Both versions are contained on the same disc.Blu-ray Video Quality - Video quality on this release is in the full 1080p awesome image in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio. It is very much worth noting that this video presentation has been THX Certified -- just as with the two previous Blu-ray Disc 2D releases of the film. It's obvious, as noted that the &#34;3D Quality&#34; was shot in true stereoscopic 3D on a very advanced camera system. That translates into this having one amazing visual presentation either in 3D or 2D.A significant topic that was buzzing about the film's original debut to home video was the aspect ratio it would be presented in. Of course, this release and the two previous 2D releases of the film are presented in the 1.78:1 aspect ratio, and Cameron has mentioned in press conferences that this choice was made as to offer more visual depth in long and open shots, and more of the &#34;claustrophobic&#34; effect in close-ups. Another thought to ponder regarding the film having been filmed in stereoscopic 3D, even when you pause the movie, you do see not only what could otherwise be considered motion blur, but the slight dual-focus you may expect from a 3D presentation.Not to be left unmentioned is the equally valuable work of those from Stan Winston Studios who provided many of the physical on-screen character effects. The amount of &#34;3D pop&#34; in 2D is excellent and you get a really great sense of depth and such even in the 2D presentation of the film. The 2D version of the film certainly has a few pros to viewing the film in 3D, with the availability to see so much of the detail, the beautiful saturation, and a solid black level. With no disrespect to the audio presentation, you will perhaps find yourself more taken up with this phenomenal video quality so much that the audio track may be only background elements to you upon your first viewing.It should really come as no surprise, this once again earns itself a perfect &#34;5 Star Rating&#34; for overall video quality and is still the utter definition of &#34;reference quality&#34; in terms of Hi-Definition visuals. In either 3D or 2D, you'll be amazed by the video quality found on this release.Blu-ray Audio Quality - Audio quality on this release is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. First, note that just like the video presentation, this audio presentation too has been THX Certified. As this audio track simulates the fictional world of Pandora, the 5.1 setup offers an amazing audible performance that is well representing of the story's sci-fi and ethereal nature, making it nearly impossible to decide on where to start in describing this presentation. One of the first things that will surely charm your ears is the original music composed by James Horner, perfectly conveying the tones of both worlds; the humans' camp with a more hearty and war-like brass sound, and the natural world of the Na'vi, translating a more tribal and passive sound. Composer James Horner was also responsible for the original music on the films &#34;Apocalypto&#34;, &#34;Troy&#34;, &#34;Titanic&#34;, &#34;Apollo 13&#34;, and &#34;Braveheart&#34; to name just a few. In the scene involving Jake`s avatar being captured by the tribe, the background chatter of the surrounding Na'vi people fills the soundscape, providing 360 degrees of voices that simulate the feeling of truly standing within the action. This for instance is a great example of the superb usage of all the channels in the 5.1 setup, however, when it comes to this release, generally it is not even necessary to pinpoint a specific scene, as one could basically scan through the film on Blu-ray and be impressed.All general sound effects are impressive, offering multiple channel usage, panning at times, and simply a general clarity of sound. You've really got to hand it to those behind the efforts in the sound department here in having created the sounds of imaginative fictional creatures, sci-fi machinery of multiple sorts, and even a setting that, though merely portraying the paradise-like world of Pandora, is itself absolutely glowing with subtle sound. The dialogue is presented perfectly on this release, as both the live-action organic recordings from the live actors on set, and the presumably voiced-over dialogue of the Na'vi characters.Overall this is once again just downright impressive, almost as much as the visuals in terms of sound mix and very much worthy of deeming &#34;demo material&#34; in terms of audio as well. &#34;AVATAR&#34; in its much anticipated retail release to Blu-ray 3D earns a perfect &#34;5 Star Rating&#34; for audio quality -- just as the film scored in the debut release and re-release (both of which were 2D). I'm happy to report that much, I really am, and I think the fans will once again be very, very pleased with this awesome stunning audio presentation.Finally, it remains to be seen whether a title of even this astronomically high profile can push 3D hardware sales so long after its general release and after the initial hype behind 3D TV have said things have died down a bit, but I disagree, as I love any 3D Blu-ray discs. While AVATAR remains a big favourite of mine, and maybe Blu-ray fans have perhaps moved on to fresher releases like The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises and may see this AVATAR release as another money grab on the way to the so called up and coming &#34;Ultimate Version&#34; and we really mean it this time! No really, this is the one to buy! It really boils down to this: AVATAR fans now have the 3D version to watch that doesn't cost an arm and a leg to acquire, and folks who already have the Panasonic branded release don't need to buy again, unless a new artwork and the slipcover is brought out. Who knows what future editions will hold, other than that there will be future editions and that there probably will be new material in them. As it is, this is currently the best way to watch AVATAR in 3D in the home and the price doesn't really hurt. Certainly one can see why AVATAR is an important and destined-to-be prominent film through the rest of the history of the medium not only as a clear-cut fan-favourite but also as a hallmark visual effects movie that will be remembered alongside the likes of Star Wars, The Last Starfighter, Jurassic Park, the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Toy Story. Overall the bonus material here is a huge disappointment but let's face it, you've most likely bought the &#34;Extended Collector's Edition&#34; Blu-ray Disc set that actually contains bonus materials. That release also contained two other cuts of the film; whereas this only contains the original 162 minute theatrical cut. Sometime soon maybe we'll see a fourth and final release in both 3D and 2D that contains those other two cuts of the film and bonus materials but for now if you want to see those you'll just have to go back to (or consider purchasing) the &#34;Extended Collector's Edition&#34; 3-disc set on Blu-ray. I saw AVATAR in the cinema in 3D and was sort of impressed, but now seeing it in this amazing Blu-ray 3D disc, it looks even more superior and I am glad I waited for this Blu-ray version to be released and I have been more than impressed and now it is a great honour to now having this added to my ever expanding Blu-ray 3D Collection.

As a fan of "The World At War",this series ranks right up there with its insightful treatment of the 1914-1918 Conflict. The producers have even included COLOR pictures from the period. As a previous reviewer mentioned, this series does for World War I what "World At War" did for World War II. I will be watching this series over and over again.

There is so much common sense in them yet back then, you could laugh at yourself or others without it being taken as a belittling gesture.  You have to be able to laugh at your humanity in order to get through this life successfully; not thinking too highly of yourself.  Nowadays in this great nation, no one can be a loser...no one is taught how to.  That's why I like old movies.  That's how we should live.

$review_text.: Back in the 1970's every other film was a disaster movie and in many respects most were truly disastrous ('Piranha 2', `Jaws 3', and `Earthquake' to name a few) and then there were some good ones and `The Towering Inferno' was one of them that could survive more than one viewing as well as `The Poseidon Adventure'. This then is Koreas take on the classic tower on fire scenario.We get all the scene setting, the single dad with the crush on new girlfriend, the devoted mum with ungrateful son, the working class lottery winner and selfish VIPs. Then we get to meet the fire crew led by a tough veteran and his loyal crew and the rookie that has only joined the team that day. Add to the mix a corner cutting building firm and make it all happen on Christmas Eve and you have the potential for one helluva movie. And yes it works there is sentimentality by the bucket load, excellent CGI, over acting a Pantomime Dame would kill for and unashamed attempts to get you to blub - I ruddy loved it.This is not high brow, but it is packed with action, thrills, misery and heart rending stories that all go to make an excellent disaster film. And at 117 minute just flies by with more cliff hangers than a cliff hanger convention - probably. If you want to just be carried along by a plot then you could do a lot worse than this; in Korean with rather good sub titles and it's got two towers not just one like the original so double the fun.

$REVIEW.: In this DVD, yoga instructor Sarah Powers offers a unique blend of yoga practices.  As she explains, her work strives to integrate the Yogic and Buddhist traditions and to encourage balance by providing both Yin practices, which are more receptive, and Yang practices, which are more active.  Given this, the DVD includes six main practices:  two active flow practices, two Yin practices, savasana, and meditation.  In all of the sequences, Sarah is leading a class of 7-8 participants, each of whom are practicing the postures at different levels.  Sarah frequently walks around the class performing adjustments, and she encourages modifications as well.The Main Menu of the DVD is set up to allow the user to select Vinyasa Practices, Yin Practices, Savasana & Meditation, Guided Sequences, and Special Features (includes Sarah's Biography, Teachers, and other info).  I have broken down each segment as described below.VINYASA PRACTICESIn each of these practices, Sarah places a strong emphasis on focused breathing, particularly integrating the prana from the upper half of the body with the lower.1. Sun Salutation Practice (40 mins.)  Here Sarah methodically leads the class through a slow and deliberate series of sun salutations.  Each round includes a different lunge variation, ending with hanumanasana (splits) in the final round.  Sarah adds some strength moves, such as chaturanga repeated three times in a row, as well as some other unique variations, such as a simple locust with the legs moving in and out.2. Vinyasa Flow (55 mins.)  The first 15 minutes of this series opens with a very slow round of sun salutation B.  Sarah then instructs what she calls a standing sequence flow.  Staying all on one side, she leads the class through warrior 1, warrior 2, reverse warrior, and then a series of variations which move between intense side stretch and warrior 1; this was a physically demanding series which really worked the glutes.  She finishes with revolved triangle and standing split before moving to the other side.  Next comes some simple backbending with a locust series and camel, and then the practice finishes on the floor for a reclined hand-to-foot series and happy baby pose.YIN PRACTICESA 7-minute "Notes on Practice of Yin Yoga" precedes these practices; Sarah explains the three principles of Yin Yoga (finding edge, practicing stillness, and holding poses a long time).  During the Yin practices, Sarah weaves in talk of Buddhist theory and includes stories and anecdotes; however, both practices also include an "abbreviated audio" option.  Most postures are held for five minutes.1.  Yin Kidney (49 mins.)  This practice focuses on the Kidney/Urinary channels, which means that the emphasis on backbending postures; simple twists are included as well.2.  Yin Liver (57 mins.)  This segment, which address the Liver/Gallbladder meridians, focuses more on hip-opening postures.  However, this practice also includes a few backbends, twists, and forward bends.SAVASANA.  This is an 11-minute sequence that can be added on as an option to the vinyasa practices.  It includes both spoken guidance from Sarah and time for silent reflection during the second half, which includes a singing OM chant.MEDITATION.  Sarah begins this 31-minute segment with a 7-minute introduction to meditation practice.  She describes the three stages of meditation--outer, inner, and innermost--and explains how these stages move from the most basic, mainly focusing on the breath, to the more complex, involving other sensations.  She also reviews the three inner attitudes involved in meditation (impartiality, non-judgmentalness, and cultivating interest).  In the final 10 minutes of the meditation practice, Sarah's talking becomes less frequent, allowing more time for silent reflection.In the DVD's liner notes, Sarah offers tips for how to sequence the practices to best suit your needs on a particular day.  However, the DVD also includes a "Guided Sequences" section, which contains 10 pre-arranged practices ranging in length from 60 to 154 minutes.  Sarah encourages the user to listen to one's own experience to chose how to best use this DVD.  Overall, this DVD provides an excellent introduction to Yin Yoga with the additional option of more traditional vinyasa practice, although those who are used to more fast-moving "power" vinyasa yoga may not appreciate Sarah's more methodical style; similarly, some might find Sarah to be overly chatty during the Yin practices.  Personally, I found Sarah's voice to be soothing, and I thought that her storytelling added a distinctive element to the sequences, but I did find the Yang practices to be a bit slow for my liking.  I would recommend this DVD to all levels of yoga practitioners who are interested in experiencing Sarah's unique approach.

$review_text.: I love this chunk of the show, what with krillin riding a horn through his guts like a rodeo bull and eventually (many episodes later) popping like a grape as piccolo get his chest swiss cheesed by a finger beam. Oh yeah. It's that kinda program. And now its available cheap but cropped. Im used to it now, and having it in perfect japanese format is worth it. I will have episodes 13 of original dragon ball (why they havent gotten through to kidmark and bought back the rights to those first twelve episodes, we may never know) through the end of the show in uncut bliss after I buy this and the android/trunks set. That accounts for almost ten years of collecting tapes and later dubtitled first copy dvds and then when funimation got its 5h1t together and decided to do it right, they split up the cell dvds and skipped to boo. I waited through 2002/2004 and then they finished cell, and then GT, then finally the movies over the past couple of years and milked this cow dry. Now with the redos, they are sorta making up for it, but the widescreen thing was of course sand in our faces, and we may buy the definitive boxed set on blue ray or some other funky format in the future that is considered by hardcores as perfectly perfect. So what. If that thing is like 30 bucks a pop, I may pick that one up too.

$REVIEW.: "Earthquake" (1974) won an Oscar for its special effects, and it was originally presented in the ground-breaking "Sensurround" format, in which an extremely low-pitched sound system literally shook the theater seats whenever the movie's tremors and quakes would hit


 As a result, it was a monster hit at the theaters
 But was it any good?  Let's put it this way

 "The Towering Inferno" is considered a mediocre film at best and was such a hit it was nominated for Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy


 "Earthquake" was released the same year and was passed over, except for a special Oscar for its admittedly stellar special effects


 That the Academy wanted nothing else to do with it speaks volumes


 In a word, it stinks.Actually, the title conflagaration doesn't even happen until nearly an hour into the film

 Until then, the audience suffers through 60 minutes of dreadful exposition and laughable character development:  Architect Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner as a bickering middle-age couple, Lorne Greene as Heston's father-in-law (!) and boss, Genevieve Bujold as a struggling actress and Heston's would-be mistress, George Kennedy as a suspended cop, Richard Roundtree as a pathetic Evel Knievel wannabe, Victoria Principal as a sexy Italian bombshell, Lloyd Nolan as a doctor and Barry Sullivan as the director of the Seismatological Institute
 But top casting honors goes to the bizarro miscasting of Marjoe Gortner as a National Guardsman and sex pervert who attacks Principal after the quake hits

 And, yes, that is an unbilled Walter Matthau providing unneeded comedy relief (the film is unintentionally funny enough as it is) as a drunk who drinks his way through disaster.Other than that, the film has no plot whatsoever


 The quake hits, lasts nearly ten minutes (instead of several seconds like normal quakes) and destroys all of Los Angeles, killing millions in the process
 It's up to Kennedy and Heston to rescue everybody, then half the cast dies and the film ends, leaving the rest of the cast standing in the rubble

 In all, it's a depressing experience.The cast, with one exception, is mediocre to terrible


 The exception is Bujold, who acts with sincerity and restraint, making her character the one human being among a bunch of cardboard cutouts

 Heston is properly heroic but exhibits none of the charisma of his late '50's-'60's heyday

 Gardner is unbearable as his wife--vulgar, foul-mouthed and irredeamably b*tchy; it's hard to believe she was once a desired '50's sex symbol
 Greene, Nolan and Sullivan do their best with underwritten roles, and Roundtree looks like he wants to fire his agent for his ridiculous role in which he exhibits none of the charisma of his famous "Shaft" role
 Kennedy overacts wildly and joins Heston in watching his career go down the drain in a series of dreadful disaster flicks
 As for Gortner and Principal, they are both absolutely horrible, but at least Principal is sympathetic


 Gortner's pervert is simply an embarassment.As for the technical aspects, the effects are stellar for the era, although the film also contains one of the cheesiest special effects shots I have ever seen:  the blood splattering at the end of the collapsing elevator sequence

 (And do we really need to see the victim with glass in her eye?)  The editing and cinematography are cut-rate at best, and Mark Robson's direction simply stinks
 As for the script, "The Godfather"'s Mario Puzo reportedly submitted a draft that was heavily rewritten by George Fox, so primary blame for the horrible dialog, cardboard characters and lack of coherant plot has to be placed on Fox and Robson, who handles everything like a blind traffic cop
 In short, it's a mess, and viewed without the sensurround, the film loses the only jolt it packed in the theater


 The only good thing about the film?  The eerie musical score.As for the DVD, even if you disagree with me and like this film, skip this presentation

 It features horrible sound and a mediocre picture and is typical of Goodtime Videos cheapjack presentations


 It's in panavision widescreen, but still looks awful, and may be prone to "sticking," much like other Goodtime titles


 My advice, wait for Universal to release a remastered DVD version, if you must have this atrocity

$review_text.: Sitting through a showing of David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive" is like being attacked by a gang of psychotic thugs..you beg for them to stop but they keep coming at you; in this case for an interminable 2 1/2 hours.Ever since 1986, Lynch, in one way or another has been trying to recapture the success of "Blue Velvet," a totally original, cult blockbuster that boasted some of the weirdest images in film history (who can forget, for example the sight of Dean Stockwell in drag lip-synching Roy Orbison's "In Dreams" into an industrial lamp while Dennis Hopper, his face contorted in pain, mouths the words along with him).Once you make a film as completely over top as "Velvet", any attempt to recreate the feel is bound to end up in silly self-parody.In the case of "Mulholland Drive," a couple of clever Lynchian moments(the meeting between the film director and "The Cowboy," for example) aren't enough to save what is essentially an incomprehensible mess of a movie that seems to go on for centuries.It's not a good sign when you watch a film and start praying for closing credits that never seem to come.***Special features on the DVD are practically non-existent, save for the theatrical trailer...in the case of "Mulholland," that's a blessing!

$review_text.: Dennis Franz is spectacular in this role and with out question the reason the show was such a hit. Dennis Franz was there from the first through the last episode of "Blue" and just became better and better with each season.  The only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 5 is due to the presence of Caruso who only served to drag the show down.  True acting genius is when a really nice guy has to play the part of a first rate Ass**** and manages to do it with a serious degree of humor, just as Dennis Franz did for the shows entire run.  A miserable, self centered individual just acting the part is nothing special.  I was glad to see Caruso go.  Jimmy Smitts was a much better fit by far.  Over all, it's the best Police drama ever. A series that was able to touch on if not explore every conceivable human emotion; giving due validity to all, while managing to keep it real.
$SUMMARY.: If Not for Caruso It would have been 5 Stars...

$REVIEW.: If you are considering this DVD, know that it is part of a BIBLE COLLECTION BOX SET of 6 DVDs, at less than half of the price of buying them one by one, (featuring ABRAHAM, JACOB, JOSEPH, MOSES, SAMSON & DELILAH, and DAVID), the Box Set is currently under $50, while separately they sell for at least $15 each. The Box Set is definitely the way to buy if you are building a Bible DVD collection!In ABRAHAM, Richard Harris is perfectly cast! He looks like the classical image of Abraham, and his acting carries the whole film effortlessly, brilliantly.Barbara Hershey almost redeems herself as Sarah, after having played Magdalene in the awfully foolish THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST film.This movie covers most of the Bible writings about Abraham, in the book of Genesis.  They show pretty much all of the major points. I like that they show Abraham's father, Terah, as well as Lot and his wife and daughters. Eliezer, Abraham's right-hand man, is also shown.They cover Abram leaving the land of his father's. They have God speaking to Abram, sometimes the viewer can hear God, sometimes not. They show the trip to Egypt, and lying about Abram's wife/sister.  They actually are pretty in-depth, beyond scripture, up to this point.They have Lot moving to Sodom, getting kidnapped, and Abram rallying his men to rescue everybody. They show Melchizedek, the High Priest of God, but don't show Abram doing the first tithe in the Bible.The scenes with Sarai and Hagar are all good. Actually, it is interesting how they show that Sarai is a midwife for helping to deliver babies for their people, which could be Scriptural, when Sarai says Hagar will deliver Abram's son on Sarai's  knees, I think. At least a lot of these scenes are so close to Scripture that you have to look them up to verify them, or not! I like that! It makes you learn and remember more about Scripture, in a fun way, by watching a movie as a supplement to regular Bible reading.They cover the destruction of Sodom, and don't avoid the homosexual aspect, but only show it briefly.The movie pretty much ends after the sacrifice of Isaac scene.This is probably one of the best of the 9 movies made by LUBE Productions, in the 1990's. THE BIBLE COLLECTION BOX SET  has 6 of them, which are all 3 hours long, except for JACOB at 90 minutes. You can get the other 3 LUBE movies in the BIBLE SERIES Box Set, which has ESTHER, SOLOMON, and my favorite LUBE film, JEREMIAH!
$SUMMARY.: Richard Harris is Great as Abraham! Lots of Bible Scenes, but Missing Details

$review_text.: As in seasons eight and nine of "Smallville", this tenth season will appeal to fans of the "comic action-adventure" variety.  Those looking for solid writing, richly developed characters, and legitimate, non-predictable "wow" moments have likely trickled off after seasons 5-6.  I have been with the series for the long haul and, while thoroughly enjoying the first 5 seasons, liking 6-7, and despising 8-9, I cannot give the final season good reviews based on nostalgia perpetuated by the show's ending.There are a few basic plotlines that run throughout this final season, all of which fall flat in one way or another:-The U.S. government's reaction to superheroes: an almost blatant rip-off of many themes from "The Dark Knight".-The Clark/Lois relationship: Should work, but (as writers) you can't have Lois be EASILY the most annoying character on the show for six seasons and then expect us to put all that aside and love her in the seventh.-Clark Kent coming to terms with the hero he is destined to become: Pretty much every decision/conclusion Clark comes to this season in terms of embracing his destiny is watered-down due to botched attempts in previous seasons.  Because the show was on a year-to-year basis for so long, the frequent stops-and-starts in Clark's transition to Superman rendered that penultimate transition without much drama.Really, there are only three things that I enjoyed about this season (aka the reason I can give it 2 stars instead of just 1):-The "Earth 2" plot arc, which allowed us to see some characters that hadn't been around for awhile.  The alter-universe characters kind of muddy things up in the end, but it is nice to see them as "themselves" once again.-The episode "Homecoming", where the Smallville writers give a not-so-subtle nod of acceptance to fans like me who became disenchanted after the season five episode "Reckoning" and the slow bleed that followed.-The "Finale" episode, where us long-surviving fans finally get the payoff that we've all been waiting for.Thus, it basically comes down to this: If you loved "Smallville" in the early goings and feel it has declined since "Reckoning", this season won't change that opinion whatsoever.  However, if you still got enjoyment out of the later seasons, you'll probably like this one too.

$review_text.: As a kid, I thought it was entertaining to squirt ants with my water gun and see if they could get away without drowning.  I'm not proud of that fact, but I daresay I'm not the only dumb kid who ever tortured ants for fun.  You can't tell me you've never kicked over an anthill before.  For centuries, ants have also paid the price for the "crimes" committed by their nastier cousins (bees, wasps, etc.) because they are the perfect scapegoats - you can find them anywhere, and they're oh so harmless (well, except for the likes of fire ants and soldier ants).  Just think about how many ants you've unknowingly squashed under your shoes over the years.  Even those who "wouldn't hurt a fly" have probably sent countless ants to that big ant hill in the sky.  If I were an ant, I would hunger for revenge on all the ruthless humans.  Here they are, mind bogglingly more powerful than the mightiest of their tormentors (no human can lift something twenty times his own body weight), veterans of interspecies warfare, more organized than even the mightiest of human armies, and yet they can do nothing but wish they were large enough to really teach humans a lesson.  Ironically, human beings actually grant them their wish in this seminal science fiction/horror classic.Nothing much happens out in the New Mexico desert - until now.  It's a big mystery at first, as Sgt. Ben Peterson (James Whitmore) and his partner pick up a shell-shocked young girl wandering aimlessly in the desert, then discover an abandoned car trailer down the road that has been ripped apart pretty good.  The only clues - a bloody shirt, a mysterious print in the sand, and some scattered sugar cubes.  The situation gets curiouser and curiouser when they check in at Gramps' store and find it all smashed up, just like the trailer.  Neither the cops nor FBI Agent Robert Graham (James Arness) can make heads or tails of it all.  They are still grasping at straws when Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn) and his daughter Pat (Joan Weldon) from the Department of Agriculture arrive in town.  Their suspicions are soon confirmed - it's an ant problem.  A really, really big ant problem.  A really, really big problem with really, really big ants.  Nine years after the atomic tests in that area of the desert, the radiation has caused the most unnatural of genetic mutations.  The brass wants to find and bomb the nest, but the good doctor points out the futility of such an act.  It's not just a matter of killing the gigantic ants - they have to make sure no queens have escaped to parts unknown.  If that has indeed happened, a whole army of Orkin men couldn't save mankind.The idea of giant ants terrorizing the countryside sounds pretty hokey, but Them! is fantastically successful at presenting the story in a serious, plausible manner.  The question of whether or not to inform the public is given due consideration, for example, and the giant ants themselves are pretty impressive, especially for 1954.  I doubt they would scare even the youngest of kids in our day and time, but they are not ludicrously constructed, ridiculous looking "monsters" (OK, I'll admit those giant pipe cleaner antennae are borderline adorable) or the product of superimposed images of ants run amuck.  You also don't get too many shots of them along the way, and this helps the film generate an impressive amount of suspense early on.  Throw in some pretty good acting (Edmund Gwenn and James Whitmore are especially good, while James Arness' voice alone lends a serious air to every scene) and a minimum of nuclear bomb moralizing, and you've got yourself one of the best classic monster movies ever made.

$REVIEW.: All Mine to Give(released April/57)stars Glynis Johns(Mary Poppins)as Mamie,Cameron Mitchell as Robert,Alan Hale(Gilligan's Island),and a host of others.This 50s film is just one of a few  minor entries Warner's has issued in recent times around Christmas,such as It Happened on 5th Avenue,Holiday Affair or Blossoms in the Dust.Since all these films are of varying degrees of quality,and none too spectacular,I suppose they figure why not bring them out,dust them off and see whether or not they can make some money off of them from an entirely new generation.I had seen this film on TV way back in the early 60s,I think,and I didn't think much of it.But looking at it now I have a bit higher opinion of it than I originally did.The story finds an immigrant couple fresh off the boat from the Shetland Islands,Robert and Mamie,seeking a new life in Eureka,Wisconsin in the late 1800s.They come to seek out a relative who lives just outside town but are told that the house burned down just three weeks earlier,and that the relative perished.They sit in despair,but not for too long.Mamie is pregnant and winter is coming on and they decide to stay and build a homestead right beside their relatives burned down home.At first Robert is doing everything by himself,but eventually the nearby towns folks come along and chip in to help him and his wife build the house and welcome them properly into their town.Robert gets a job in a lumber camp over 20 miles from home.The boss is a cantankerous Irishman(Hale)and the two are constantly butting heads.Eventually a fight man to man changes their feelings towards each other,and they become fast friends.One baby comes along,followed by another and still another until there are six children in all.Robert quits his lumbering work and starts a boat building business beside their home.One day one of their younger sons contracts diphtheria.Robert takes the children away for a spell and the crisis soon passes.However Robert himself comes down with the disease and succumbs to it.Mamie takes over as head of the household but she becomes worn down to a frazzle and succumbs to typhoid fever,leaving young Robbie,their first born,as the head of the household.It is Christmas eve and they bury their mother,but as the children leave the church,young Robbie talks with the doctor about their future.Everyone is concerned for their welfare,but Robbie persuades them to put off a proposed meeting to deal with them until after Christmas.The doctor and others present acquiesce to his request.Once home Robbie gets to thinking that Christmas day might be the ideal time for him to start farming out his brothers and sisters to proper foster homes in the area.It is a good idea as Robbie does indeed spend a long and emotional Christmas day making sure each and every sibling is taken care of.The film ends as Robbie heads off alone to work in a lumber camp,in the deep snow.The film takes a while to warm itself up to its viewing audience.Mitchell's Scottish brogue leaves alot to be desired,and the couple is your usual Hollywood stereotypical Scots.I can see someone from Edinburgh sitting there saying"You have to be kidding me".It's not until the couple finally begin having and raising their children that the film really starts to get a little interesting.We also wonder while this is happening what the picture has to do with Christmas,but of course the pay off finally comes near the end.The film is a good family picture though and has alot of real family values,warmth and heart.That is the key message that comes through loud and clear after all is said and done.Very few films are made like this today,unfortunately.Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is in wonderful viewing condition.There are no extras.All in all a nice little family film,gushing with family warmth,togetherness and heart.Once over the obvious flaws in characterization,and the slow beginning,it does eventually start to pay off and the Christmas connection is more than apparent with its bitter sweet ending.Recommended.

$REVIEW.: I found this to be rather lame what with the long and boring beginning, and I also found it to be very unfunny. I actually tried to make out with my fiance during this movie it was so terrible. I think the plot was good, but the direction, and the performances were rather lackluster. I just don't feel that Eastwood is cut out to do comedies. "City Heat", "Every Which Way But Loose", and "Any Which Way You Can" are the 3 worst Eastwood films that he ever did, and they all have one thing in common; they are all comedies. I got in bad with my fiance for wanting to make out with her, but I told her I really didn't want to watch this movie. I feel the reason for this film was because of the fact that it was during the time that John Glenn went back up into space in his 70's. James Garner was 72, Eastwood had just turned 70, Sutherland was 66, and Jones was 54. I just think that this was a waste of money, and time. The ending I couldn't figure out at all, and I regret having said to my fiance that we could watch this with her girlfriend, and her husband.

$review_text.: It's about time! I waited for the DVD package for well over a year. Two of my all time favorite movies, and 2, well, may as well have the set. Maybe they play better when I'm drunk or something. On to my reviews.The first Superman on DVD. This is a great movie with plenty of extras. But there is a flaw. Warner Brothers did not provide the original edit of the movie. Sometimes this is not a bad thing. Many of the other DVDs I own offer up two seperate edits of the movie &amp; I usually select the longer take. But I probably would have made an exception for Superman. There are 2 inserted scenes that I had problems with. The first was early on in the movie where the council sends a guard to arrest Jor-El. The guard goes on his way &amp; disapears. Undoubtedly he was killed en route when Krypton blew up, but it felt like a hanging plot point. The other problem scene takes place after Superman reveals himself to Metropolis. A certain tone &amp; pace is established in this movie at that scene which is thrown off by a sudden cut back to the Fortress of Solitude where Jor El counsels Superman on the importance of maintaining a secret identity. It isn't a bad scene, but it throws off the pace of the movie. The commentary track by Richard Donner &amp; Tom Mankiewicz is informative and makes me wonder how much more wonderful Superman II would have been had Donner been allowed to complete the picture. Apparently they had filmed Marlon Brando's scenes for the movie &amp; for reasons I will never understand, those scenes were excised by Richard Lester. It made me crave a completely alternate edit of Superman II. I would also like to have seen the original ending for Superman I which was also discussed in the commentary track.Superman II. Great fun. Effects aren't as good as the first Superman, &amp; the disc is woefully light on extras. One can also see camp elements at times threatening to overwhelm the picture, particularly when the three villains are blowing at the citizens of Metropolis. Scenes like that didn't bother me before, but annoyed me here. Maybe I'm getting old. Still the movie carries on quite nicely from where I left off &amp; is highly satisfactory as entertainment.Superman III showed the Salkinds getting desperate with their franchise. Or maybe they just didn't know how to manage it. The camp buries all sense of adventure &amp; wonder in the first two films. The only way they could have excused such silliness is if they had made the villain Mr. Myxlptk or whoever the little irritating imp is in the comics who turns up to harass Superman every now &amp; then. That would have provided an excuse for scenes involving walk &amp; don't walk street lights getting into a fight with each other. Margot Kidder was written out of this movie because she protested the firing of Richard Donner during Superman II. I hope she laughed in the Salkind's faces after they released this one.Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. This was the first time I actually sat all the way through this movie. It has lots of problems, beginning with Superman saving a runaway subway train when the driver suffers a heart attack. Lois Lane is on the train &amp; when it speeds up she is the only one screaming for help. The other passengers are jostled a bit but nowhere near the panic that Lois is displaying. That is very out of character. Then, when Superman stops the train, he actually keeps some rescue workers from getting to the injured driver so that he can deliver a short speech on the safety of Metropolis's subway system. Not so super. Scriptwise they were about 4 drafts away from something presentable. In terms of special effects, this is diametricly opposed to the first Superman movie. The special effects in Superman I were great with one or two bad effects shots. In Superman IV the effects by and large were bad with one or two good effects shots. And why did they have Nuclear Man take Mariel Hemingway into outer space? It was a very very stupid scene. It would have played better if they were just high over the city. Yet all in all I am satisfied by this set.

$REVIEW.: Ok, I'll tell you that this is a movie that's full of suspense and terrifying special effects of giant tornados wreaking mass havoc through middle America. That right there is pretty entertaining, and is about all you should expect from this movie - but you'll notice I gave it 4 stars.I'm a *huge* tornado buff; I'm fascinated with and utterly terrified of them, so the special effects were enough to keep me gripping the theatre armrests the first time I saw it, and the couch the next several times. The plot...well, it's a love story/good v. evil/scientific competition/buddy movie...sort of. Phillip Seymour Hoffman probably has the most interesting role in the film, and pulls it off exceptionally well, The rest of the characters are largely forgettable, with lines of dialogue that, by and large, range from the bland to the outright annoying. Still, there are some genuinely funny moments, and a line here or there that made me laugh out loud.Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton are two storm chasers in the midst of a divorce. They have gone their separate scientific ways, after almost completing a special set of instruments that will gather large amounts of data from inside the tornado itself. The movie is the story of how they get the instrument to work, their relationship as it develops again throughout the course of their travails, their sidekicks, and the &quot;bad&quot; scientist (Cary Elwes) trying to beat them to the punch with the device. The supporting cast are all able actors, and do a fine job with what's given to them.The thing that really, *REALLY* bugs me, though, is the horrible science! This is, after all, a movie *about* *tornadoes* - it seems that they could have easily done a bit more research and gotten the majority of the details right. Ah well, c'est la vie, c'est la guerre.The effects, though, are fantastic! ILM has once again worked their particular brand of wizardry, and for most of the time, the twisters look absolutely genuine. Fabulous. The suspense and the effects pretty much make the lack of plot and horrible science forgiveable, and we're left at the end with the satisfaction that comes from having sat through a horrifying vicarious experience.Good stuff, overall.The DVD extras aren't exceptional, but there's a good bit about &quot;the making of,&quot; and some commentary tracks.

$review_text.: Almodovar here fashions a film unlike any of his others; he's a master at creating unique scenarios that defy easy categorization. An Argentinian reporter living in Spain, Marco, meets two people by chance--a female bullfighter, Lydia, and a male nurse, Benigno. He falls in love with the bullfighter, and forges a friendship with the nurse when Lydia is struck by a bull while in the ring and goes into a coma.At the hospital where she lies, Benigno looks after another young woman in a coma, Alicia. It is there that the two men begin a friendship based on their mutual concern for the two women they are attached to.The ending of this film is one of the strongest things about it; in fact, it's one of Almodovar's strongest endings of any of his films. It's brilliant, proving that fate often does come full circle in our lives. To say any more would be to give away the supremely clever, emotionally gripping plotting of this one of a kind film. What can be said is that Benigno belies his name; Marco is more tender than he might appear; and there's a surprise American actress in the story as well (yes, a real American actress who speaks surprisingly good Spanish).It's always a real pleasure to see an Almodovar film and this is certainly no exception. The trademark infusion of Spanish culture is here as well, with scenes in a bullring--and there's also a concert of music by the great Brazilian composer-performer Caetano Veloso which is attended by Cecilia Roth (from All About My Mother) and other well known Almodovar actors.There's also a very strange sequence of scenes from a fictional (i.e., made up by Almodovar himself) Spanish silent film called (English translation) The Shrinking Lover based largely on The Incredible Shrinking Man but also on Almodovar's fiery imagination, that has to be seen to be believed. The last little scenelet from this film-within-a-film is absolutely wacko.Definitely recommended.

$REVIEW.: One day when I was about 13, I bought a old VHS of Night of the Living Dead at Wal-Mart for $5.  I had no idea what I was buying and no idea what kind of horror I was about to witness.  I made the mistake of watching the  movie by myself in a dark room that night.  Halfway through the movie I had  the light on and was peering out the window and looking at the door to the  TV room.  This movie scared the heck out of me.  Anything to do with  Zombies would forever scare me especially when I watched the other movies  by Romero and played the Resident Evil Games on Playstation.  That was then  and now I am 27.  I still have the VHS copy of Night of the Living Dead.  I will never get rid of it because that movie still scares me to this day.  Then I am looking thru the DVD movies and I come across this movie.  Night  of the Living Dead - 30th Anniversary Edition.  My first thoughts were,  Awsome!  I then sat and watched all the aspects of this DVD.  I cannot  believe they tried to milk this movie again and all they accomplished was  defiling this great horror classic.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was  because the new score music was pretty cool, but did not belong in this  movie.  What they should have really done was code this movie to DVD  without altering it at all.  The new re-edited, re-scored, extras scene  added version of this horror classic is a horror to watch.  The new added  scenes actually had me laughing at the bad acting.  I know many of you are  saying, bah!  What do you know!  Let me explain.1.  The added scenes  where completly horrible and full of bad acting.  Yes the scenes were added  seamlessly because they remastered the movie.  The preacher was a horrible  Billy Zane wannabe and the zombies in the new footage could not even walk  like a zombie.  Another scene had a car crash where the driver hit the  winshield and lost his brain, and the wife in the passenger seat and two  daughters in the back of the car have no injuries and seemed to have  remained in their seats and not sprawled all over the car after a head on  collision with a tree.  They were not even wearing seatbelts!  Many of the  Zombies just walked normally, how horrible!  And they spent money to add  this footage?  Total rip-off! 2.  The added score is completely awful.  This is a old movie and needed the old sounding music from the orginal.  They try to add the new score everywhere in this movie!  Someplaces in the  movie need to have no music!  This sets the mood and has the audience on  edge.  The orginal score, what they called &quot;library music&quot;, was  better than the junk they added. 3.  The totally ripped and hacked the  movie cuting out dead scenes that took up space.  This space is needed to  again keep the audience on edge and have them thinking what will happen  next.  So what do you get?  I hacked and cut movie where some parts are cut  to add the 15 minutes of new footage.  A total waste. 4.  All the extras  are just a waste of time to watch.  If you have to have this DVD to add  to your collection, don't say I warned you.  It is horrible, horrible,  horrible.  You are better off finding the movie un-edited.  Yes the  re-mastering cleared it up, but the blurryness of the orginal added to the  horror of the movie.  On a final note, if it aint broke, DON'T FIX IT!

$review_text.: As this movie opens, things are looking up for mutants


 A new President (Josef Sommer) is so sympathetic to their concerns that he has created a Department of Mutant Affairs, helmed by one of their own--former X-Man Dr
Hank "Beast" McCoy (Kelsey Grammar)
 At Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, the mansion has been repaired after the commando incursion ofX2 - X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition), and students of all sizes scurry through the halls at class-change time

 Even Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seems to have settled in as part of the team, although in Danger Room simulations he still has a tendency to bend the rules


 But Scott Summers (James Marsden) is so consumed by grief over the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) that he's abdicated his position as leader, forcing Storm (Halle Berry) to step into the slot--a job she doesn't want

 And Magneto (Ian McKellen) remains at large and a matter of deep concern to the government
 Then Jean is unexpectedly resurrected from the depths of Alkali Lake

 But Prof

Xavier (Patrick Stewart) fears what the strain of saving herself may have done to her Class 5 mutant powers


 Meanwhile, Warren Worthington II (Michael Murphy), head of a great pharmaceutical company, has announced the creation of a vaccine that can suppress--permanently--all mutant ability

 Despite assurances that taking it will be entirely voluntary, Magneto, that survivor of the Holocaust, fears what its existence may mean and begins assembling a mutant army called "The Brotherhood."  In the end, it's five Xavier students against a mass of raging outlaw mutants with a weapon that may mean the end of the world.This splendid climax to the X-Men trilogy is worth every cent of its cost, from the sensitive portrayals of inner conflict suffered by Wolverine, Xavier, Storm, and Jean to the thunderous John Powell score (X-Men:  The Last Stand (Original Motion Picture)) to the introduction of imaginative new mutant characters (including Ben Foster as Worthington's son/namesake, Angel, with his gorgeous 20-foot wingspan) to the stunning special effects
 (I'm only disappointed that Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler didn't make a return appearance.)  Note: If you didn't see it in the theater, DO NOT stop the player until after the credits have rolled


 You'll see a short scene that hints of more to come--and if it's as good as this, I can't wait!

The DVD picture is pretty crappy, but it's not the worst I've ever seen (if that makes you feel any better). This title is available on about a hundred other bargain bin DVD sets (anything with &#34;sci-fi&#34; label on it and chances are &#34;Embryo&#34; is stuffed away on there somewhere) but I wanted the single DVD edition because I'm a chump. Barbara Carrera is a doll, and she's on full display here at a couple of points, but this really isn't an offensive movie. The ending, while typically tragic, is also very 70's: unpredictable, unusual, and effective. B-

$REVIEW.: &quot;With Six You get Eggroll&quot; bowed in the nation's theatres in August of 1968.  It quickly became a popular success at the box-office thanks, in large part, to the enduring popularity of the film's star, Doris Day.  Although some critics compared it, unfairly, to another comedy success, &quot;Yours Mine, and Ours&quot;, &quot;Eggroll&quot; can more than stand on it's own merits.The story about a widow with three children who falls in love with a widower with one daughter, is not new or original. However, thanks to a charming script, smooth direction by Howard Morris and the cast headed by Day and Brian Keith, who have a great onscreen chemistry, it's a delight. By the film's conclusion, audiences have shed a few tears and had more than a few laughs.Doris Day plays the 40ish widow with charm, sex appeal, and a great deal of warmth.  She is completely convincing and it's in her small touches that she especially proves her mettle as one of the most natural screen actresses ever.  Keith is manly and real, and the supporting cast which includes Pat Carroll, Alice Ghostley, George Carlin, Barbara Hershey, Jamie Farr, and the popular rock group, The Grass Roots, lend credible support.While the film, the first production of the CBS film wing, may betray it's television roots, seeming at times like a pilot for a sitcom, it is ultimately a fine working of a winning formula.This was Day's cinema swan song, after two decades of enormous popularity, and it's a film that none of the participants need feel anything but pride in.

$review_text.: ... did I return a perfectly good dvd of this film. The kind folks at my local LOCAL  store (really, they still exist) empathized and allowed me to return the dvd for full credit toward the blubook purchase. This, after only watching -for the first time- the first 30 min. of this film ("Wow! this warrants the best available package!"). ADVICE to those receiving dvd: IF you want the 64 page book -which my dvd label said was included- and the dvd weight feels no more than the disc itself- you will need to return it (don't open it!)and repurchase blu. Contact with Warner Bros yielded nothing (many distributors, at what point sticker misplace?, maybe you find success if..., blah blah). $10 now doesn't sound like too much extra after all, dvd > blu. If not for want of book, would have been content with dvd: it has the same features, just no printed extra. Stellar quality on 'lowly' dvd: crisp/clean print, nicely transferred color tints, love-the-Carl Davis-score, vintage studio tour f-ette ('25). If you don't own a blu player, despair not! You will still be more than impressed with the dvd quality. I realize that "blu ray books" by definition include such literature, but WB (or whomever!)should not have included such a misleading sticker on the dvd if they were not planning to follow through. (They could have offered it as a video supplement on dvd -saving cost and heft of 64 pages-, but they didn't.) UPDATE #2: just bought blubook, which had exact 2 stickers as dvd. Me now thinks it's lazy manufacturing, instead of WB's fault. Anyway, the blu set is simply magnificent in materials used and design: "worth the price of admission"; the blu itself? EXQUISITE! Dvd is mighty good, but I can definitely notice an uptick in blu's image. Glad I plunged for it: a significant addition to library!* Add. notes on dvd (it's not about the book after all!): I have a number of silent dvds -and some blu-, on a myriad of labels (incl. Criterion, Kino, Image): "Parade" looks as good as ANY of them. So crisp and blemish free (wish all could have been preserved THIS well). Just to be able to watch -and OWN, can you believe it?- pristine prints of such classics from long ago, man-alive!(old guy me). Viewing archaic cinema in oft-magnificent restoration is incredible! Sorry for gush, but really: Joan of Arc, Potemkin, Faust, Wings, Thief/Bagdad, The General, Safety Last, Dr Caligari, Intolerance, Destiny; the list continues to grow! Are we blessed in this age or what?

$REVIEW.: With the release of the restored uncut version of Don't Answer The Phone, we see the Katarina's Nightmare Theater series getting back on track after the disappointing The Day After Halloween (we won't go there)


This is a release worthy under their banner, as DATP is a low-budget, sleazy piece of exploitation featuring genre favorite Nicolas Worth (recognizeable to genre fans for his appearance in Wes Craven's Swamp Thing, Darkman, and others).I usually like to go into in-depth reviews, but it's basically like this: Misogynistic cult wierdo photographer goes on a killing spree, strangling women but not before removing their garments for kicks
The violence is unsettling, but as Nicolas states in his interview (and I concur), this really is just a T&A; film at heart, but thats great because without it, the rest of the film wouldn't work

Nicolas' portrayal of the killer is sometimes convincing and other times down right humorous
Just check out some of the faces he makes during his freakout moments (sort of a laughing/crying combo)
Maybe it was the beer, but I was hollering.This film is perfect for a late night sleaze sandwich and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was


Too obscure for the casual cult exploitation fan, but for horror die-hards who think they have it all, you will want this in your collection

Just be warned, it is a misogynistic film, so definitely not a first-date kind of film (unless you have a really great date).Keep it up Scorpion Releasing


And Katarina, if you are reading this, you are as charming as ever
Can't wait for American Nightmare.Recommended!

$REVIEW.: Definally a good old movie, if your age is near of mine, you will enjoy this movie. Seen it came to my memory all the good and odd situation that I lived on those forgotten days. Looking a young Cuba Gooding Jr. in a good performance and of course the hero, leading by James Marshall, when the innocence of those days was to wait for the good boy to take care of the problem and resolve them at the end of the movie, with no special or cg effects, but with a real acting, this movie was an icon for me.In the technical issues the sound is not good for this kind of media, I guess there isn't an improvement method in the way, is regretful cos it will make a difference in the movie, but the quality of the image and photography is very good. No doubt you will enjoy to watch this movie.

$review_text.: I have always enjoyed the Harry Potter films and my liking of them has increased with each new film that is released
And before I go any further, I should note that I did not read any of the books (except for the first one) before seeing the films

I am much more of a movie fan (obviously) and my philosophy is that if you want to be able to enjoy both the movies and the books, see the movie first.Now, back to Harry Potter
This film marks the beginning of the end as Harry, Hermione and Ron travel the world looking for horcruxes (evil artifacts containing pieces of Voldemort's soul) and the means to destroy them.This is my least favorite film in the franchise

It was dark, it was depressing, and it raised more questions than answers


Now, I know that this is supposed to be a two-parter and since the story is only half finished, there will always be lots of questions
But overall, there was very little here to enjoy
Every movie usually has a stunning climax and some really cool magical moments in the film, and this one lacked both

The climax was weak and there wasn't really anything new to see in this film

Nothing that we haven't really seen before

And if we've seen it all before...I'm sure most of my opinions will change (hopefully) with the viewing of the second part, but until then, I'm not a big fan of this film


Aside from that, the special effects were impressive, the acting was well played, and the story moved smoothly.As far as questionable content:The film is dark and there are some scary and violent moments throughout

This is not recommended for younger children.*Spoiler Alert*According to the book, In the moment where Ron faces off against the demon within the horcrux, he is given a vision of Harry and Hermione in love and there is a moment where they kiss

In the film, the "kiss" became more of a sex scene with Harry and Hermione making out while completely nude


You never see any private parts, but it is a very risky scene

I hated this moment of the film
The naked make-out session was inappropriate, random, and just plain weird
So, just a heads up.*End Spoiler Alert*[...]

$review_text.: A few months ago the BBC aired an excellent programme entitled `How Pop Songs Work' with conductor, Charles Hazlewood, amongst others, providing insights into what makes for hit pop songs.  Hazlewood's analysis concentrated on five main areas: melody, structure, lyrics, performance and arrangement.  One of the songs chosen as an exemplar was John Lennon's `imagine'.  Interestingly this was the only `Beatles' representative but, considering how prolific, not to mention successful, the song writing partnership of Lennon and McCartney were, it would not have been surprising if the programme had used only Beatles numbers.  In a similar but less formal way, this DVD attempts to provide an analysis of what it was that made the Beatles, and in particular L&M; so successful.There are some truly fascinating insights into the particular chemistry of the pairing that changed the world of popular music forever: not only how their unique influences and backgrounds complimented one another, and the increasingly (creative) tension that produced the music that became the score to the story of our lives, but also how it is possible to discern the degree to which each contributed to particular album tracks.Contributors also offer opinions of the extent to which it is possible to recognize Dylan's growing influence on, particularly, Lennon's songs in what became, between L&M; and Dylan, an increasingly symbiotic `relationship'.For anyone interested in the history of popular music, how genius works in practice or, perhaps, how the nature of collaboration - in comparison with a solo artist; e.g. Brian Wilson,  produces works of art, this DVD will be an invaluable resource.

Oh, until they go against the agreement that is. But, that is not Count's fault. Truly a peace of art with a beautiful animation, very little action, and a great lesson to be learned at the end of each episode. It could be considered rather repetitive after a while, but until then, it is a great example of Japanimation.

$review_text.: Endure is about what you would expect for most movies that went straight to video.  And while it was shot better than most Redbox fare, it's still not a very exciting movie.Endure follows the story of a seasoned detective who is teamed up with a rookie partner, in search for a kidnapped woman before she ends up dead.The good news is that the cinematography and color correction for the film are both decent, so it doesn't look particularly low-budget.  The film was shot in Lakeland, Florida, so there's a nice combination of older city meets marshland scenes.The bad news is that the story isn't especially interesting.  The film could have easily been condensed into a one-hour episode of CSI, too much of the movie is filler. There is a sub-plot involving the veteran detective's bedridden wife that becomes an annoying distraction as the film progresses.The cast is largely made up of "Where Are They Now" actors.  Judd Nelson continues to crank out straight-to-video appearances, and Endure is no exception. Actress Joey Adams of Big Daddy fame scores a fairly pointless role as Nelson's ailing wife, and neither bring much to the table.Despite getting top billing on the DVD cover, Tom Arnold gets a grand total of five minutes of screen time in this film.  Worse yet, nothing about him makes him a remotely scary villain in this film.  Ironically, there's more backstory in this movie on the disturbed kidnapper that dies earlier in the film than there is on Arnold's character.Overall, there's nothing special about this film.  It's not a very moving thriller, the acting is average at best, and the dialogue is very weak.  Give this one a rent before you even consider buying the DVD.

$review_text.: "In the end there can be only one."This film spawned three sequels and a very successful television series, and a  second television series "Highlander: The Raven" has come and gone. I think there was a short lived cartoon series as well. Like most very successful movie and or television series there is a series of books to continue where the movies and television series left off, you can blame Star Trek for that trend I think. So where is the comic book and the video game?Now The Plot. In 1530's Scotland Connor MacLeod played by Christopher Lambert, learns his true identity and nature of being an immortal, by dying. The only way an immortal  can truly die is to be decapitated. Connor is trained by fellow immortal Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez played by Sean Connery, for the time of "The Gathering". The Gathering is a time when only a few immortals are left and they will be drawn to each other by a strong feeling and compelled to fight each other to the death. The last remaining immortal will win the prize, which although not thoroughly explained, is the main goal for all immortals. The bad guy is called The Kurgan (Clancy Brown), the strongest and most powerful of all immortals. The Kurgan knows that Connor is immortal and during a battle between clans kills him but is swept away by other fighters before he can cut off Connor's head. Flash-forward to the 1980's Connor, going by the alias of Russell Nash falls in love with Brenda Wyatt (Roxanne Hart) a police pathologist that reminds him of his 1500's Scottish wife Heather. Conner soon learns that The Kurgan, now Mr. Victor Kruger is around and on the hunt. You get the idea for the rest of the film.This DVD is released by Republic Pictures, and has it's good qualities and it's bad. The Picture and Sound Quality is very good. The Sound is digitally THX re-mastered and is therefore excellent. The soundtrack is performed by Queen, an interesting side note is that they were originally slated to do just the main title theme but loved the film so much they were inspired to provide more songs for the soundtrack. The Picture quality  is mostly great but dark in some places and somewhat grainy during some of the flashbacks to 16th century Scotland.The Extras are a mixed bag. This DVD is Widescreen, but I don't think animorphic. There is the original Theatrical trailer, which like most DVD trailers is of lesser sound & picture quality of the actual movie. The 10th Anniversary Director's cut has unseen, in the theatre, footage, mostly the Scottish Highland flashbacks which add to the understanding of the film, but for some reason were left out for the original North American theatrical release. There is an audio commentary by Director Russell Mulcahy, with Producers Peter Davis and William Panzer. Language Choices for playback and subtitles is English & Spanish. Another feature, which is both a blessing and a curse is the "Slide Show" of publicity stills, background production information, cast bios and all sorts of stuff. When this is "Played" it flies by with Blinding turbo MTV speed, with no audio background. Fortunately my Sony player has two slowmo speeds, so with the slower speed, and by pausing, I was able to view the bio information, the publicity stills, production notes etc... Another curse is the chapter selection has ONLY 9 "Key" Scenes, fortunately by using the scene list in the booklet you can enter individual scenes remotely.When I first saw the brown bordered cover, with the word  "Widescreen" all in bold caps on the left hand side, slightly larger than the Title, I knew something was done very cheesy.Since I'm an occasionally watching fan of the television series, I like the movie that made the series possible. It took me two or three episodes of the series to understand some of the ways of the immortals. In some ways I like the series better than the movie. But I'm disappointed with some of the "Extras" on the DVD. Unfortunately some of the practices I'm disappointed with, are apparently standard Republic Pictures DVD practices. The Second DVD in the Highlander series "Highlander 2 - Renegade Version" also has a lame 9 "Key" scenes chapter search and the ultra fast "Slide Show" and don't forget the Bold "Widescreen" emblazoned on the front cover of the case.So although my ratings will be on the high side I'm disappointed with the packaging and especially the lameness of the extra's. So for Highlander The 10th Anniversary Director's Cut I give a 4 for picture and a 5 for sound.

$review_text.: ONE FRIGHTENED NIGHT has to be one of the ten best films made at a "poverty row" studio during the 1930's.  To fill up the public's insatiable need for movies back in the 1930's, not only did the major studios grind out hundreds of pictures a year but several small studios were also cranking out films by the score, albeit with their low-budgets and generally no-name casts and background talent, the films were far less entertaining or memorable.  One of the very best films made on this bread-and-butter circuit however is ONE FRIGHTENED NIGHT, an excellent mystery with more than a little comedy in the CAT AND THE CANARY tradition of spooky goings on in an "old dark house" to quote the title of another film of the genre.  There are no big names in the film but it is loaded with familiar faces fans of films from the era will recognize who often played secondary roles in films at the major studios.Charley Grapewin stars as an ailing, elderly multi-millionaire who rather loathes his lot of hanging-on relatives and associates but has no one else to leave his money to, his estranged daughter now deceased and the whereabouts of his only grandchild long unknown.  Grapewin decides to give five of the group $1 million each before his death given the upcoming new estate tax laws will eat up much of their inheritence.  The leeches are thrilled with the news but the ill-humored Charley bluntly tells them if he knew where his granddaughter was they wouldn't be getting a dime and she would get it all.  And who should happen to show up later that evening but Doris, the granddaughter!!  The former heirs are devastated by her appearance as she and grandpa sneak off to get better acquainted.  Before the night is over ANOTHER woman claiming to be the granddaughter shows up - moments after the first one has been murdered.The cast is excellent and the atomsphere very good in this creepy old mansion thriller.  Starring as the two Dorises are lovely Mary Carlisle, a well-known starlet of the era and in 2011 still around at age 99, one of the few survivors of American films from the 1930's, and the equally beautiful Evalyn Knapp, who wasn't quite as known but appeared in many B pictures including films with John Wayne and starring in the talkie remake of the serial THE PERILS OF PAULINE.  Other familiar faces in the cast include Hedda Hopper, Lucien Littlefield, and Charles Wilson.  The best performances are given by the underrated character actress Rafaela Ottiano (SHE DONE HIM WRONG, CURLY TOP) as the cold, rather sinister maid and especially the wonderful comic actor Wallace Ford (billed "Wally Ford" here) as Mary's vaudeville partner, a smart-aleck magician.  Given this film from a studio out of business for many decades and long in public domain, it's not surprising the print quality is less than great but it's wonderful that it survives at all given it's one of the best "B" movies of it's era.

$REVIEW.: There isn't much new that can be said about Orson Welles (1915-85). He created some of the very best theatre, radio, and films in history, and is credited by almost everyone for making the #1 film of all time - "Citizen Kane" (1941). But someone along the line, early on, he started having problems with producers and studios, left projects unfinished, went over budget, and a whole host of problems that ultimately resulted in fewer and fewer films of lesser and lesser quality. With the failure of "The Lady from Shanghai" (1947) and "Macbeth" (1948), Welles' career in the US was virtually finished, and he went to Europe where he was still held in high regard. By 1955, when this film was made, Welles had some modest successes ("The Third Man"), but was relegated to making low budget films and appearing as an actor to finance his various projects.The film is based on a series of "Harry Lime" radio shows (1951-2) produced by Welles from London following the success of "The Third Man" (1949) that featured Welles as Harry Lime. Like "Citizen Kane" (1941), the film involves an investigator researching the past of a mysterious multi-millionaire by visiting the sites and talking with the people who knew him when.Robert Arden (1922-2004) plays the smuggler who is hired by Welles to investigate the past he claims he doesn't remember. This was Arden's most significant role in a career that involved some 50+ films between 1944 and 2001. Prior to this Arden had worked with Welles on the "Harry Lime" radio series.Beautiful Patricia Medina (1919) plays Milly, Arden's girlfriend. Medina had a busy career in the 40s and 50s and is best remembered from her roles in films like "Fortunes of Captain Blood" (1951), "Lady in the Iron Mask" (1952), and "The Black Knight" (1954). In 1960 she married Welles' good friend and long time collaborator, Joseph Cotton.Akim Tamiroff (1899-1972) plays Jakob Zouk, the last man alive who knows Welles' secret past. Tamiroff is best remembered for his role as the Uncle Joe in Orson  Welles' "Touch of Evil" (1958) and twice was nominated for Best Supporting Actor ("For Whom the Bell Tolls" and "The General Died at Dawn"). He appeared with Welles in 4 films.Michael Redgrave (1908-85) plays another one of the people that Arden interviews on his quest to uncover Welles' past. Redgrave is probably best known as the father of actresses Lynn and Vanessa, although he had a prodigious career as an actor appearing in more than 50 films between 1938 and 1975. He was nominated for an Oscar ("Mourning Becomes Electra") and twice for a BAFTA ("Time without Pity", "The Night My Number Came Up").Mischa Auer (1905-67) plays The Flea Professor. He was nominated for an Oscar for his role in "My Man Godfrey" (1936), one of more than 100+ films he made, often playing a foreigner in films like "Clive of India" (1935) and "Anna Karenina" (1935). I liked him best as the ballet teacher from "You Can't Take it With You" (1938) and the cowboy in "Destry Rides Again" (1939).The top films for 1955 were  "Lady and the Tramp", "Mister  Roberts", Guys and Dolls", "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Picnic". The Oscars went to "Marty" (Picture, Director, Actor), "Mister Roberts" (Supporting Actor), "East of Eden" (Supporting Actress), and "The Rose Tatoo" (Actress). Other notable films released that year were "The 7 Year Itch", "Blackboard Jungle", "Lady and the Tramp", "Oklahoma", "To Catch a Thief" and "The Virgin Queen".The NY Times called the film - "in turn, baffling, exciting, infuriating, original and obscure. It is also, from start to finish, the work of a man with an unmistakable genius for the film medium." OTOH they said - "His ambiguous cutting techniques and piercing sound track are so unconventional that they operate as constant distractions to an attentive observer." Their conclusion - "...Arkadin is less a performance than a presence, and, on screen or off, it overwhelms a film, which, for all its strangeness, is seldom less than brilliant."No film director was better than Welles in exploring the corrupting side of power and for expressing the longing for innocence, which can never be achieved. Hence his obsession with the past and sending the innocent into the labyrinth. The themes of self-deception and betrayal are always on Welles' mind and are present here too. But the film is so deeply flawed, perhaps it is the better judgment to save one's energies for a more substantial approach.FWIW - I think I figured out why Welles used Arden, who does a terrible acting job, and why the film is as bad as it is. Arden worked on the radio show, and if you close your eyes and listen to the movie, you'll find hidden herein a great radio show. IOW Welles put some figures up on the screen to illustrate his marvelous radio show. Listening to this way the film is a real treat, but...Bottom line - deeply flawed Welles film with no redeeming qualities. Of interest only to rapid fans of Welles.

Agar (Major Jay) and some scientists work feverishly to find a way to stop the invasion. Good 50's sci-fi. However....Journey to the Seventh Planet lacked the substance to be proclaimed &quot;good&quot; but is a fair bowl of popcorn,late night, sci-fi spoof about a creature bringing the space explorers memories/fantasies to life as he plots to come to earth for a takeover. What it lacks in action it somewhat compensates in the humor dept. I also saw a familiar spider and heard familiar spider &quot;noises&quot; which im convinced were &quot;borrowed&quot; from Earth vs. the Spider. All in all a good package for the price of admition.

$REVIEW.: In my youth I read a lot of science fiction:  Clarke, Heinlein, Asimov, et. al.  But I never enjoyed time travel as a plot device because of the old paradox problem:  I go back in a time machine to the time before my parents met and kill my father.  Therefore, I could not have existed in the future to go back in time to begin with.  Or better yet I go a back in time and kill Albert Einstein when he is a child.  As a result the entire history of the world instantly changes.  Balderdash.  On the other hand, going forward in time is at least a reasonable concept.  But I couldn't meet myself as an old man in that future time, because I had departed from my original time stream to travel into the future.  There couldn't be two of me existing at the same time.  My God, one is plenty.  "Looper" is just that sort of story and I keep saying, "Wait a minute, that just doesn't add up!"There once was a fellow named Brite,Whose speed surpassed that of light.He departed one day,And in a relative wayReturned on the previous night.Having got that off my chest I can say "Looper" is a well made and acted film.  I always enjoy watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt who brings an intensity to his roles.  He was particularly fine in "The Lookout,"  "Mysterious Skin" and "Brick"  I even enjoyed his small role in "The Black Knight Rises" especially when we find out who he really is.  What's in store for him with that franchise?  Oh, yes -- "Premium Rush" was fun, too.

Initially I didn't have any interest in seeing a film about Formula 1 drivers that I knew nothing about, but Ron Howard changed all that with an incredibly quality picture.The aesthetic of the film was fantastic, rather than making you feel like you were watching a movie about the 70's he makes you feel like you are watching a movie in the 70's. The acting was excellent and the story was even better. As someone who doesn't really have any interest in F1, this movie brought the sport to my attention like I would have never imagined.

$REVIEW.: King of the Hill is one of the best T.V. shows around.  It is hilarious yet intelligent with unforgettable and very believable characters (who doesn't know someone like the government-hating, paranoid Dale or the self-aggrandizing Peggy?).  Like the first DVD set, Season 2 if compiled with a lot of professionalism and care. The extras on these DVDs are very unique and creative.  My favorites are the deleted and extended scenes.  There is commentary on at least one episode per disc by the characters or the creators that are entertaining and interesting, although the character commentaries are better on the first season disc set.  The designers of this set also give the viewer an inside look at how animated T.V. shows are made through the "Animation Evolution" featurette which has many options.  Other extras include The Arlen School of Drawing tutorial, music inspired by the Hills, and book excerpts from "The Boy Ain't Right."Season Two has 22 episodes which include the following: (1) How to Fire a Rifle Without Really Trying: Bobby discovers he excels at shooting but Hank's traumatic childhood may prevent them from participating in the father-son funshoot; (2) Texas City Twister: One of my favorites.  Hank tries to save Peggy and Luanne from a twister headed for the Shiny Pines trailer park; (3) The Arrowhead: Peggy is intrigued by an archeologist but Hank is suspicious; (4) Hilloween: A fanatic church member tries to cancel Halloween in Arlen; (5) Jumpin' Crack Bass: Hank finds a cool new fishing "bait"; (6) Husky Bobby: Another favorite.  Bobby becomes a model for husky boys...over Hank's body!, (7) The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteburg: Hank and the gang are humiliated during a paintball incident; (8) The Son That Got Away: Connie, Bobby, and Joseph visit the make-out caves; (9) Bobby Slam: Connie wants to try out for the wrestling team; (10) The Unbearable Blindness of Laying: Another favorite!  Hank goes blind after seeing his mother and male companion "in the act," (11) Meet the Manger Babies: Luanne starts a puppet show.Episodes on the next two discs: (12) Snow Job: Hank discovers his boss uses an electric stove; (13) I Remember Mono: Peggy suspects her husband made out with a classmate back in high school; (14) Three Days of Kahndo: Hank and Dale must sneak over the border to get out of Mexico; (15) Traffic Jam: Hank and Bobby encounter a Chris Rock-like traffic school instructor; (16) Hank's Dirty Laundry: A local video store accuses Hank of not returning racy videos; (17) The Final Shinsult: Cotton and Dale are in cahoots; (18) Leanne's Saga: Luanne's mother is back and falls for Bill; (19) Junkie Business: A great parody of real life, Hank hires a drug addict and finds out he cannot fire him without breaking some discrimination law; (20) Life in the Fast Lane, Bobby's Saga: Bobby get a job at the Speedway with a mentally unstable boss; (21) Peggy's Turtle Song: Bobby is diagnosed with ADD and Peggy decides she must become a full-time mom to help him, but becomes bored and signs up for guitar lessons from a feminist; (22) Propane Boom-Part I: The Mega  Lo Mart threatens Stricklen Propane.  This one was part of that "Who's going to die?" cliff hanger.

$review_text.: Another Jim Carrey vehicle.Jim Carrey bouncing off the walls, ceiling and anything else he manages to camp it up on


 That's what I expected from Me, Myself & Irene

 Honestly, that wasn't too thrilling
 And while it's certainly the perfect vehicle for his gymnastic style comedy, it's also a Farrelly Brother's production - rejoining Carrey with the director team of There's Something About Mary and KingPin
 Their first collaboration was Dumb and Dumber  - the hit film that made Carrey an international superstar
 Here, they return to their roots in what at first appears to be a simple road trip movie similar to Dumb and Dumber, but soon explodes into an outrageous farcical exploration of one man's - or is that two - battle with multiple personality disorder.If there's a single ongoing theme in most Farrelly movies, it's the disabled and their place in our society, or lack thereof

 Besides mawkish TV movies and occasional theatrical roles, the disabled are relegated to the sidelines in most forms of popular entertainment
 However in Bobby and Peter Farrelly's twisted slices of American life, the crippled, mentally challenged and down right psychotic all get a chance to shine


 Some may cringe when they see these characters on the receiving end of so much abuse, or giving it for that matter, but it's refreshing to see disabled characters period in mainstream cinema
 Here multiple personality disorder is mined for laughs until you feel guilty for laughing, but you will laugh.Both Farrellys hold court on their film with a great audio commentary and it's clear they had a ball making the film
 Surprisingly, these guys for all the outrageous vulgar shenanigans they concoct, are pretty laid back, normal, even modest people


 Certainly the affection they hold for their home state of Rhode Island must endear them to folks back home.This movie really surprised me
 Early on I dismissed it as another Jim Carrey payday with him mugging wildly for the cameras
 And that said, he definitely doesn't turn in a subtle performance

 However, after viewing this film, even Jim Carrey detractors would have to admit he's one of the most accomplished physical comedians to ever grace the silver screen

 Overall this is an extremely funny and original film
 The entire supporting cast really delivers
 I consistenly found myself going back over scenes to laugh again and again at the gags

 At times the bits may go on too long and the subject matter may push the envelope well beyond repair and good taste, but somehow it all comes together and works beautifully despite a thin plot.

$REVIEW.: I, like quite a few folks writing one-star reviews, have experienced the "Dead DVD" problem with this disk
 I've owned it for quite a few years, probably hadn't played it in at least 3 years, and when I popped it in my player the other night, nothing...nichts...nada
 It wouldn't recognize the disk
 And neither would 5 other DVD players I own

 Not sure how a DVD goes bad, as there are no scratches, marks, or any other apparent physical changes to the DVD, but yes, it no longer works
 Just as quite a few others have experienced.The concert?  I was happy to have some fairly good, up close footage of the band playing (as always), though the additions of Billy and Igor didn't do too much for me

 They play well-enough, but just seemed a bit out of place

 Doesn't help that Igor became a bit infamous for his off-stage antics as well


 But all in all, I enjoyed seeing a slightly different delivery of the Yes material which, minus some the "Open Your Eyes" and "Ladder" tunes I fairly well like most of their catalog.So, from the point of view of the concert, I'm a little pissed the DVD died
 As a consumer, I'm REALLY ticked off the DVD apparently had a shelf-life I was entirely unaware of.

$review_text.: Yellowstone [BBC Earth] [Blu-ray] [Region Free] [UK Release] Yellowstone, the world&#8217;s first National Park, is no ordinary wilderness. It is a lost world of vast plains and endless forests, defended on all sides by towering mountains. Home to America&#8217;s last great bison herd, the grizzly bear and the wolf &#8211; it is the most extensive thermal area on earth, with more than 10,000 boiling springs, fumaroles and bubbling mud pots and more geysers that rest of the world put together. It&#8217;s these strange natural wonders that first made Yellowstone famous and still makes it unique today. This landmark series reveals the grandeur of this fascinating place as its animals struggle to survive over the course of the vividly changing seasons.Join the charismatic cast of Yellowstone&#8217;s wildlife, as they turn to face the extreme challenges of the seasons and discover just what it takes to brave temperatures of 40 degrees below zero, or to live through raging forest fires or to fight to the death for the right to breed. The daily struggles of the wildlife are intimately linked to Yellowstone&#8217;s greatest secret that sleeps right beneath the snow, which is arguably the largest volcano. The fate of everything in this extraordinary wilderness is in the hands of forces more powerful than we can possibly imagine. Narrated by Peter Firth.Producer: Andrew MurrayComposer: Edmund ButtCinematography: John Shier, John Aitchison and Paul StewartResolution: 1080pAspect Ratio: 1.78:1Audio: English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and English: 2.0 LPCM StereoSubtitles: English SDHRegion: All RegionsRunning Time: 180 minutesNumber of discs: 1Studio: 2|EntertainAndrew&#8217;s Blu-ray Review &#8211; Blu-ray discs has propelled the popularity of home video documentaries and firmly established these as cherished demonstration discs the world over. The gorgeous cinematography of the BBC documentary series Planet Earth even set early Blu-ray sales records as one of the best-selling, non-feature film Blu-ray discs on the market and led the way for other nature documentaries filmed in 1080p to the format.I've always been intrigued by the Yellowstone National Park, located in Wyoming, U.S.A. Yellowstone was the first area to be granted National Park status at the turn of the 19th Century. An entire eco-system in itself, Yellowstone is home to hundreds of different species (many endangered), from all walks of life; land, sea and sky. However, below their feet the delicate balance of life above ground could be disrupted in seconds by one of the largest active volcanos in the world. Whilst this is only of peripheral concern in the program, the fact of the matter is that the beauty of Yellowstone would be forever changed, as well as causing major worldwide effects when it erupts again. The scary part is, it could happen at any time. But as proven time and time again, life finds a way through these calamities.The Yellowstone Blu-ray includes three 50 minute documentary programmes that make up the series 'Winter', 'Summer' and 'Autumn'. In total, that's nearly 3 hours of amazing content on the one disc, which makes the price tag very competitive and well worth getting.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; Yellowstone is presented in a widescreen aspect ratio of 1.78:1. The vast majority of the series was filmed with the spectacular RED ONE High Definition video cameras. Yellowstone is certainly up to the high standards set by its predecessors including Planet Earth. The series features a very sharp image, with very accurate colour. Occasionally, some scenes will feature noticeably degraded images, but this is more a reflection of tricky filming locations or bad lighting, and not a reflection of the quality of the transfer. Some truly spectacular scenes were captured by the documentary crew and the quality on offer here is equally jaw dropping. It's hard to go back to standard definition documentaries after you've seen these.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; The main audio track is encoded in 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio. To my knowledge Yellowstone is the first BBC Blu-ray documentary to offer a 5.1 audio mix. I can't say it offers a whole lot more to the experience than the standard stereo mixes, but the additional rear effects, including general ambience is welcomed. There's quite a bit of separation in the front channels and the centre channel mostly handles the narration. There are very little low end bass effects on offer is quite superfluous.Blu-ray Features and Extras:Yellowstone People - The Blu-ray edition of Yellowstone includes a trio of decent documentaries, all of which are presented in standard definition. Jeff Henr - The Snowman [10:00] profiles the ex-park ranger and winter photographer who works through the winter as Yellowstone's so-called &#34;roof shoveler.&#34; Geyser Gazers&#34; [10:49] concerns the naturephiles who track and observe the eruptions of Yellowstone's many geysers that helped the BBC crew capture some of their most striking Geyser footage. Mike Kasic - The Fishman [10:26] profiles the sound recordist and Montana resident who spends his free time swimming the Yellowstone River. It only amounts to a half-hour of content, but it's certainly better than nothing. Unfortunately at the start of each documentary, the sounds dips and you have crank up the amplifier, but when the main part of the documentary starts, the sound goes loud, I just wish they had spent a little more money and time on putting this very annoying unprofessional part at the start of each documentary right. Despite this slightly negative aspect, it's definitely an interesting series of documentaries and nice that their individual contributions could be acknowledged.Finally, Yellowstone is a really spectacular documentary series and another winner from the BBC. We the British taxpayers, do not begrudge paying for a TV Licence, especially when TV Programmes such as these are the outcome, that is why I am so proud to live in the United Kingdom, as our BBC Television has no adverts to interrupt the flow of the TV programmes. Of note however, normally Sir David Attenborough usually does these types of Documentaries, but instead this time it is performed by the smooth talking actor Peter Firth, who does a really excellent professional job, especially explaining all the different aspects of the amazing and unique Yellowstone National Park. I originally viewed this on BBC Two and was very impressed, but for a long time I was reluctant to purchase this particular Blu-ray disc, well my doubts were well worth trounced, as it is a totally spectacular Blu-ray disc from the very professional BBC and the images are totally awesome. I also definitely recommend the other BBC Blu-ray disc CHINA, as that also has totally awesome spectacular images, as well awesome sounds and if you invite your friends round to view both BBC Blu-ray discs, I know for sure their jaw will drop when viewed on your 3D Flat Widescreen Television.

Bad movies made for no money by hacks. This 70's jigglefest  looks like someone actually thought this was a good idea.  Plot?  Basically, it's any given &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; episode put on by a  middle school acting class.That this abomination had real actors in it  is incredible.  You'll cringe at Jim Backus and Peter Lawford.  And never  let it be said that MST3K is without heart.  You can actually hear Mike and  the bots groan when Backus and Lawford make their embarassing appearances.Servo: Do you think Peter Lawford even knows where he is?All in all,  the riffs were great.  But as with many MST3K's, that doesn't always dull  the pain.

$review_text.: Russell Crowe is magnificent as &quot;Lucky Jack&quot; Aubrey, captain of the HMS Surprise.  Aubrey and his crew are hoping to intercept and destroy Acheron, a powerful and speedy French warship. The year is 1805, and the French are at war with the British. Capturing Acheron would give the British a much-needed naval victory against Napoleon. However, Aubrey and his crew soon discover that Acheron's captain is an extremely clever tactician and a formidable opponent.  After a crippling battle, Aubrey must decide whether to lick his wounds and head for home or continue his pursuit of Acheron.Peter Weir gets high praise for his meticulous direction of &quot;Master of Commander.&quot;  The movie looks authentic down to the smallest detail.  Weir shows us how crewmen behaved while living for months on board a warship.  Scenes of tempestuous storms, raging battles, wounded men screaming in agony, and young boys trying to act as courageous as their adult heroes are unforgettable.  The cinematography by Russell Boyd and Sandy Sissell is breathtaking.Russell Crowe completely inhabits the body and soul of Jack Aubrey, who at times acts like a man possessed.  His pride and strong sense of duty sometimes blind him to reality.  Yet, Aubrey is also a man of principle, compassion, and deep feeling, who cares very much about the men under his command. Paul Bettany is Crowe's counterpart as the intellectual, sensitive, and outspoken Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's talented surgeon and a gifted naturalist. On quiet evenings, Stephen plays classical music with his old friend, Captain Aubrey, but the two men eventually clash over Aubrey's obsession with completing his mission successfully.Although &quot;Master and Commander&quot; takes place in the nineteenth century, its themes are relevant to the times in which we live. Weir raises very interesting questions about the nature of patriotism and leadership.  Crowe, in a gritty and sharply delineated performance, demonstrates the agony of making decisions that will inevitably lead to a loss of life.&quot;Master and Commander&quot; is a swashbuckling movie that one rarely sees these days, and it is also a thoughtful look at courage, determination, love of country, and humanity.  It is a wonderful movie that is one of the best of 2003.

$review_text.: This TV show IS and WILL ALWAYS be my favorite show. I have all of these episodes taped from way back when I was a kid when the generation of the VHS (recorders came out). and that was not long after 1982 when Spoons began. I had to wait until reruns so I could tape them but it was worth all the wait. Now the tapes are dragging but (NO MORE). Sony did it! I know this will make Rick,Joel,Erin,Jason,Alfonso,Corky proud that this was released. Oh, and lets not forget the sly Christine Belford (Ricks Mom)..and, If only Mr houseman were alive. He made that show as well. He was (the greatest Grandfather). the bond between Rick and his grandfather was so great. "Gotta love the learning to drive episode". There are also some great guests on the show, Including Whitney houston,Mr T,Gary Coleman,Pearl Bailey and the ever so popular Menudo. This show makes you laugh,Cry,get angry like I did when Rick told freddy Lippincottleman that he wasnt his friend lol. The hardest thing in the world to see was derek leaving the show. That episode was very emotional. I was feeling at first that it wasnt going to be the same but the show was great from start to finish. For all you new people that are going to buy this....You are in for a real treat! Rick Schroder,(Ricker) youre an awesome actor!R.I.P for two great actors franklin seales,John HousemanPS: For those of you that worry that you have to buy so many sets that you might lose interest in this (do not worry) This show ran from 82 to 1987 so not many sets to buy. Please buy this so that Sony will continue to release them. I promise you wont be let down. Every season is great! of course the first three seasons are my favorite and rick grows in every season but all of them have a very good story!(ADDED NOTE) I got the DVD set today and let me tell you...Brilliant picture quality. Fine remastering.  I am so pleased to toss out my first two VHS tapes that has the first season on them. I kept them because I was a little worried that they were going to edit the show's ending like they do sometime on tv for air time but sony did not butcher the show. silver spoons lovers will be very happy with what sony has presented us with this set. (Lets just hope they dont botch it up and leave people hanging for a year or so for each additional season release.

$REVIEW.: If you were only going to buy two discs, this should be your second one. It has 3 full yoga routines, plus the yoga matrix. This is an evolution of Shiva Rea--it is much more creative than Yoga Shakti. There are parts that I like, and parts that I don't. In fact, I don't like any of the 3 routines as a whole routine!  However, I use the matrix and use only the segments that I really like. And it is a fine workout too!  Many of the segments are too easy or too creative for me, but I just never do them!  This can be a challenging disc if you want it to be (chosing the more challenging sequences) and includes some unconventional poses that Shiva developed on her own.The commentary is deep and interesting. She says things like "taste the nectar of relaxation," or "feel the rivers of your body flowing out." I find her metaphors deep and inspiring, and she doesn't overuse them. The music is interesting, soothing--a perfect complement to this exceptional practice.

$REVIEW.: *NOTE* As another reviewer wrote, do not buy from 3rd party sellers who are doubling the price of this set. Go to Amazon.ca and get it for under $45. When you consider that works out roughly to less than $8 a season, this set is a steal. The discs are all region 1 and will play in US DVD players. Also, this allows VEI to make a profit and they have been doing a good job releasing material the US companies won't touch, like seasons of "McMillan and Wife" and "The Snoop Sisters" as well as the Complete Series of "Kate and Allie". Thank you.**A Toronto-based company called VEI first acquired the rights to "Gimme a Break" back in Spring 2006 and released Season One just a few months after Universal did the same in the U.S.Universal, however, never bothered with a follow-up while VEI brought viewers Season Two in January 2007.Since then, it seemed as though "Gimme a Break" had fallen off the DVD radar. There were rumours in 2008/09 that a series set was on its way, but nothing was set in stone, until now.Proving once again that the smaller companies are the go-to people for Classic TV on DVD, whether it be the '50s, '60s, '70s, or in this case, '80s, VEI is to be commended for putting out the complete Six Seasons in one fell swoop.I wish all my favorite shows would get this kind of DVD treatment.VEI also recently brought us "Kate and Allie: The Complete Series" for a price point under $40. Some hold-outs are still waiting for Universal to do the same in the U.S. (They may be holding their breath: Universal never got past Season One on this show either). I cannot understand some U.S. customers' hesitation in ordering from Amazon.ca when the DVDs are all Region 1 and will be compatible in all North American players. However, it's their loss.The same can be said of "Gimme a Break: The Complete Series". There are no compatibility issues with these discs so those skeptical U.S. buyers should pick this up while they can. VEI's release of "The Stockard Channing Show" quickly went out of print and became hard to find just two years after release.The first two seasons of this show were my favorite when it was just Nell, The Chief and the three girls.Season Three brought a new '80s-synth theme song and the arrival of little Joey Lawrence as the orphan boy Nell eventually adopts. Telma Hopkins also became a regular as Nell's best friend Addy, with whom Nell gets into many Laverne-and-Shirley type predicaments. Addy's first appearance in "Nell's Friend" remains one of the best, funniest scripts the cast ever played.In Season Five, Dolph Sweet who played Chief Carl Kanisky passed away and the show began to flounder.For the sixth and final season, the producers moved Nell, Addy, Joey (and his little brother Matthew) to New York, where a young Rosie O'Donnell joins the cast.Many of the jokes are lame and the situations predictable. However, Nell Carter does have the personality and charisma to evelate the show, and the cast work well together. Dolph Sweet has the thankless task of playing straight man and does so admirably.Of the three girls, I always liked Lauri Hendler as brainy wallflower Julie the best, with her dry, observational humor, though Kari Michaelson and Lara Jill Miller do have their moments as boy-crazy, somewhat defiant Katie, and pubescent tomboy Samantha, respectively.Though not one of the best-written or acted sitcoms of the '80s (It's certainly no "Cheers" or "Golden Girls") there's something comforting about "Gimme a Break".The outer box is not as sturdy as I would have liked, but that's my only real complaint about the packaging. The artwork is basic but nice and they matched the correct cast photos with each volume. Each snap-case securely houses 6 discs that contain two seasons each.For those times when you crave a small dose of '80s nostalgia, this set will surely satisfy your appetite.Kudos to VEI for finally coming through and also for not making us wait for season-by-season volumes.

The acting is brilliant as well and fans of Benedict Cumberbatch will not be disappointed, he is amazing in this movie and he really tugs at the heart strings. I will warn you though, I cried (a lot) at the end of this movie, which is something that made me respect it even more, because it is very rare for that to happen to me. I absolutely loved it.

$review_text.: Many movies poke fun at the Soviets.  Having traveled to Russia several times, this is my favorite.  When so many misguided leftists of the 1940's were defending communism, this film courageously suggests the pervasiveness of the totalitarian government of Stalin. (It was filmed just before Russia was attacked by the Germans in World War II)Clark Gable plays a journalist who is also doubling as an American spy.  When his spy activity is discovered by a hotel employee cleaning his hotel room, Gable is blackmailed into helping the Russian's daughter (Hedy Lamar) who is fanatical about the progress of communism.  He has to get her out of the country before Lamar gets into trouble with her enthusiasm. What's so hilarious is that to "get the girl", Clark Gable pretends he loves communism too, all for the purpose of enticing the daughter to trust him. He promises they will both spread communism outside Russia.  (I think his pro-communist stance, even taken in jest, caused the film to be unpopular).  Nevertheless, the movie has a great cast, a wonderful love affair, humorous situations, and biting satire and wit. You'll enjoy this one.
$SUMMARY.: Amazingly Frank Satire of Stalinist Russia

$REVIEW.: Just as the 80s were beginning and the Western was about to take a sad, decade long sleep, Walter Hill, fresh from his unexpected success with the gang film &quot;The Warriors,&quot; turned out this unique and utterly remarkable Western about the James-Younger gang


 Using real-life brothers to play the outlaw kin (two Keaches, three Carradines, two Quaids, two Guests), Hill crafts an intense character study that plays like a collaboration between Western great John Ford (&quot;Stagecoach&quot;) and Japanese master Akira Kurosawa (&quot;Yojimbo&quot;, a film Walter Hill later remade as &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;).&quot;The Long Riders&quot; is close to plotless, but it paints a fascinating picture of the gang and the family and community ties that keep them together (the Ford influence right there...community was his great theme) while delving into the nuances of each character (this is where the fraternal casting really helps out)

 And Hill acheives all this depth in only 100 minutes! The action sequences are the best in a Western since Sam Peckinpah; the Northfield robbery is particularly striking and brutal.Aside from Hill and all the great actors, cinematography Ric Waite and composer Ry Cooder deserve special mention for the film's success
 Waite creates an authentic &quot;period&quot; look with his deep, glowing photography; the DVD transfer captures this perfectly for the first time
 Cooder's score is completely against the grain for the time: small, intimate, and filled with forgotten folk tunes that help paint a picture of a united, family-built community

 It is almost a companion piece for David Mansfield's equally intimate score for &quot;Heaven's Gate,&quot; released the same year as &quot;The Long Riders.&quot;The DVD has no extras except for a trailer, but the film is so wonderful and so rewards repeat viewings that you should grab a copy of it right away


 Believe me, you'll be stunned by this piece of film art.&quot;I ain't aiming to do nothing...I'm doing it!&quot;

$REVIEW.: The events of November 18, 1978, in which 917 people died in a jungle enclave in the South American jungle of Guyana have continued to rivet the world.  How could all these people have been brainwashed into following a man like the Rev. Jim Jones to their eventual doom?  What social and economic conditions could have driven both them and their leader to do what they did?The riveting 2-part 1980 TV film GUYANA TRAGEDY: THE STORY OF JIM JONES gives us a pretty good idea.  Neither director William A. Graham nor screenwriter Ernest Tidyman could have found anyone better to play Jim Jones than the then-unknown Powers Boothe.  I agree strongly with a previous reviewer who said that Boothe literally BECAME Jones right before our eyes.  It's not a surpise, then, that he should have won an Emmy for his magnetic performance.The film also features a big-name cast, including Ned Beatty, Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brenda Vaccaro, Brad Dourif, Madge Sinclair, Colleen Dewhurst, and Diane Ladd.  This is a must-see for anyone interested in incredible single events like the nightmare of the Jonestown massacre.

$REVIEW.: As mentioned in the DVD, when ice on Greenland melts, it flows into Atlantic and stops the warm North Atlantic Current hence pushes Europe into ice age. However, the sun will heat up the Arctic so much that in the end Europe will be OK.I give this movie 3 stars because it lacks entertainment and does not focus enough on what the possible strategies are for human race to survive. Because the CO2 emission is so much interlinked with human economic, social, and even vital (after all we inhale oxygen and exhale CO2) activity, what can we do? The movie concludes that we can overcome the global warming if we use renewable energy, drive hybrid car, and turn down air conditioning. Al Gore shows in graph each of these activity will cut CO2 emission increase by like 10% and added together CO2 emission will decrease. But no proof that any of these activity will cut emission by any where close to 10% was ever given. In the end this movie reduces only to fear mongering using exaggerated computer generated graphics.

$review_text.: That is correct fellow Marx Fans. I have always had a fond place in my Marxian Heart for Love Happy. Now there is MORE happy to love! In fact, over 6 minutes of footage I have never seen. Not on previous release versions on VHS, Laserdisc, at the LaPaloma Theatre when I projected it in 35mm or in my own 16mm print! The footage adds a LOT to the movie. In one scene Groucho describes how he has tracked the sexy Madame Egelich (Illona Massey) all over the world. He whips out a series of Photos showing them to us the audience with him holding Illona in various sexy poses. Concluding with one photo of her in a 1950's style batheing suit. Another restored scene has Chico, who assigns himself the task of stopping the owner of the theatre from kicking the troupe out for lack of rent payment. Before the drooling owner is paraded a bevy of beauties. Groucho says in the voiceover, "He wisely chose the Blonde on the end". Pretty racy by 50's standards. We even get a new scene where Raymond Burr tortures Harpo by placing him in a giant washing machine! There are additional small scenes sprinkled thruout, but those are the best. WOW! It is so great to see new footage of Groucho, Harpo and Chico. BUY this disc! You will be Happy you did. Johno

$REVIEW.: This was very good, except for two things which I'll mention at the end. The animation is great, highlighted by Nick Park and company's trademark of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters, which make you laugh almost every time you see someone. The color was magnificent, too.The best part of the film, however, is the clever comedy woven throughout. This is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear each frame that it would require many viewings to catch all the gags. It's just a funny exaggerated look at the oddball "Wallace" and his silent-and-smart dog "Gromit." Along the way, it pokes fun people who get carried away with their vegetable gardens, something akin to how the obsessive dog lovers were pictured in "Best Of Show."My only complaints were two typical traits of today's films, animated or not: 1 - let's make the cleric in the film look like a total idiot; 2 - let's overdo the final action scene with the predictable result but way overdone. Those aside, this is still a very amusing film that should provide a lot of laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy multiple times. Fans of Wallace & Gromit will love it.

$review_text.: My friend got this for me. I tend to not like foreign films much because I am used to American-quality films-and it's easy to notice how the camera angles and shots are bouncy or shaky or just strange in foreign films. I quickly became immersed in the story however, and ended up really liking this movie. I suggest you all to give this a shot, especially if you are just venturing into the world of foreign films, because it does a very good job with story, characters and sound. I will admit that they overplayed their soundtrack-though it wasn't open to many options, so I have to give that a shot. The second half was exceedingly well done, and I was very pleased with this. I hope to find more foreign films that are as good as this one was.In case you didn't read the title-THIS IS NOT LIKE THE ANIME. The mother, I would assume is supposedly the protagonist in the anime film, and while she isn't necessarily the main character, she does play an interesting role. Those of us fans dying to know what happened to the time traveling love interest from the anime, will be pretty surprised with his new role, and also pleased that his character is still true to the original.

$REVIEW.: Busload of workers get stranded in lost Vampire village after their driver drops dead behind the wheel. Great example of arty Euro-Trash filmmaking circa early 1970s, grindhouse style. Nice location photography, interesting frame composition, outstanding suits and hairstyles and the ultimate sleaze lounge soundtrack imaginable make this an absolute must see. And it's actually pretty creepy too, unnerving as the cast members get picked off one by one by the Vampire hordes commanded by a reclusive and mysterious countess.You can buy the ALPHA dvd, it's really a nice transfer with good color and clear image. And it's letterboxed so you can enjoy the widescreen experience...Now I know ALPHA leaves a lot to be desired when presenting the Euro-Trash catalog, their Barbara Steele films are unwatchable. So believe me when I say that this is certainly one of their best yet efforts. I have no idea where they came up with their source material for this one, but I'm thankful it's out there for fans of this stuff to enjoy.

$REVIEW.: This delightful movie stars Hugh Grant who, ever on the lookout for a new approach with women, discovers that single moms are more than happy to have a romance with single dads.  Despite the fact that Grant has no child, he makes one up and joins a single parents' group so he can meet women.  Soon he becomes involved with a woman whose friend is suicidal and who has a son who is teased at school for being a nerd.  Grant is not pleased with the fact that the boy likes to hang out at his place after school, but he doesn't have the heart to kick the boy out.  Later on, the boy becomes an asset when he meets a woman with a son his age.  Again he lets her think that he is a single father, but this leads to even more complications.  This is a charming movie about a man who thinks that he can be an island, but who finds out differently.

$REVIEW.: This is definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen


 Not having read the book, I had no basis from which to judge it before seeing it for the first time on DVD
 And now, having seen it, I have to admit that I'm still not 100% sure how I feel about the thing


 It's just 




so strange.Good things first: I found the imagery in the film to be quite arresting

 The colors were lush and vibrant, really bounding off the screen at you
 And the art direction was superb

 As other reviewers have attested, you really can almost *smell* this movie


 It's one of the few period pieces I've seen where everyone looks appropriately dirty, as if they could use a nice soapy shower
 I enjoyed the narration and all of the performances
 Alan Rickman was especially marvelous, and the main character, played by Ben Whishaw (an actor apparently more famous for the stage than anything else 






for now) was perfectly cast


 He was creepy, yet somehow strangely alluring
In spite of myself, I managed to build up some empathy for him, though he is one of the creepiest film characters I've ever seen.The drawbacks of the movie are not necessarily drawbacks

 They just come so far out of left field that it's difficult to really step back and judge them at this point, when I am still recovering from shock


 Let's just say that *SPOILER ALERT!!* I've never seen a movie that contains both a massive orgy AND cannibalism

 Who'da thunk it?  There are also several things in the movie that are not really explained and don't make a whole lot of sense, such as the glowing light that emanates from a room after a key murder, and the trail of death the lead character (inadvertently?) leaves behind him.On the whole, this movie should be seen, if only to be believed

 One of the people I was watching with left for nearly an hour to take a phone call, and when she came back and we told her what she'd missed, she was dubious, to say the least

 It's definitely something you have to stick with, despite its often bizarre and intensely creepy twists

$REVIEW.: If you are looking for a movie with an awesome cast, then Judgment Night is for you


 Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jeremy Piven and Stephen Dorff
 Four guys that give an incredible performance, showing no fear and  a great deal of courage


 Even though the movie ends with only three of the  four, they all make the movie a hit.

$REVIEW.: This is set in the Mission district of San Francisco and is about Che Rivera (Benjamin Bratt - `Miss Congeniality). He is an ex con, reformed alcoholic tough guy who has spent too much time in a `twattoo' parlour. By day he drives a bus and in his spare time he hangs with his homies and builds low ride classic American autos. He is something of a character in his neighbourhood - sorry `hood' and is one of those people that does kind deeds for no apparent gain, but is as tough as nails and keeps his fighting training up, just in case.He has brought up Jay (Jeremy Ray Valdez) - his only son after his wife died and has a very strong bond with him. Then a feisty new neighbour moves in and causes a certain amount of friction and his son decides to not accompany him on one of the low ride cruises as he has some study to do. And study he indeed does, although it is at a gay discorama of his white boyfriends tonsils with his tongue. Unfortunately some Polaroid's are taken and Che finds them. As a strong Latino macho man he finds this more than a little upsetting. What happens next is a story of how Che tries to deal with, what he sees as a hammer blow to all he believes in and how stunted some people's world view is. It can often take an apparent out-sider from the community to shine a light on the goodness that is right under peoples noses and this is brought to the fore.Whilst this is a story based around a boy being gay this is not really a gay film, so if that is what you are looking for then this might not be for you. All of the acting is top notch and some of the camera work is truly excellent. This though is a narrative driven plot and it does so with a great deal of care and feeling. Jay also has to deal with being outed at school and the rank homophobia of some of the bottom feeders from the hood.I really enjoyed this film from writer and director Peter Bratt who is Benjamin's brother but I am sure that did not influence why he got the gig - yeah right, well irrespective of the whiff of nepotism this is still an outstanding effort from all concerned and if a brotherly love in can come up with something this good, then let's hope they collaborate again very soon.

$review_text.: Having finally seen The Alamo on the big-screen here in England, I can truthfully say it was well-worth the wait. After having read both the novel, which was apparently based on the original screenplay (before all the severe editing) and the making of the film book, which also contains the finished screenplay, I was both shocked and disappointed at just how severely the film was edited before release. Being an American living in England, I have talked to several people who are totally unfamiliar with The Alamo and it's history. My wife, who is British, is one of those people. She went to see the film with me and I had to explain early on in the film just what was happening and why. The filmmakers seemed to assume that anyone who saw the film would be well familiar with the story. They really needed to explain a little more at the start of the film. Yet, despite all of these shortcomings, the central story remains strong, backed up by the sterling and Oscar-worthy performance of Billy Bob Thornton as Crockett and by some spectacular and harrowingly realistic battle scenes. The photography and the music are also first-rate. Patrick Wilson was also excellent as Travis, despite some bad reviews of his performance. Jason Patric had a thankless role as the mostly bed-ridden Bowie. Although Bowie is portrayed as a drunk, he was also supposed to have consumption (tuberculosis). Like Doc Holliday, perhaps he drank mainly to help cope with the ravages of the illness? I look forward to the DVD release and seeing the deleted scenes and hopefully, one day, the DVD release of the definitive Director's Cut. In the meantime, I can highly recommend the film just as it is. Having now received my copy of the DVD, I am somewhat disappointed by the deleted scenes. I look forward to hopefully seeing all of the other missing scenes someday.

$review_text.: In certain ways, Steve McQueen had his deficiencies as an actor.  He wasn't the go-to person if you wanted a role with great emotional range or farcical humor.  Instead, McQueen was the King of Cool, an actor whose understated performances took nothing away from their greatness.  In fact, it's hard to think of a worthy successor to McQueen; maybe the closest is McQueen's one-time contemporary, Clint Eastwood, but even that is not a perfect comparison.  The Essential Steve McQueen Collection offers a good look at what made McQueen unique.First in the six movie set (chronologically) is Never So Few, a WWII adventure story in which McQueen is in a supporting role.  The star is Frank Sinatra as the American leader of a guerilla band in Burma.  McQueen plays a subordinate whose sole combat experience is from the mean streets of New York.  As is the case in other movies, McQueen's performance steals the show from Sinatra.The Cincinnatt Kid has McQueen as the star, the title character who's a master poker player in Depression-era in New Orleans.  The plot involves a showdown between the Kid and the best stud player in the country, played by Edward G. Robinson.  The supporting cast in this one is really high-end, including Karl Malden, Joan Blondell, Tuesday Weld, Rip Torn and Ann-Margaret, and the movie itself is decent, though not great.The next two movies show McQueen at his peak.  Bullitt has McQueen again as the title character, this time a San Francisco cop assigned to protect a mobster who's going to be a witness for the prosecution.  When the mobster is killed, Bullitt uncovers a sophisticated plot and gets involved in what remains one of the great car chases in movie history.The Getaway, based on a book by Jim Thompson and directed by Sam Peckinpah, is the best movie in the set.  McQueen plays Doc Ford, a bank robber out of jail on probation thanks to a wheeler-dealer who wants Ford to commit another robbery.  After some double-crosses, Ford and his wife flee towards Mexico with lots of cash but both cops and crooks chasing them.Papillon has McQueen as a man framed for murder and sent to Devil's Island off the coast of South America.  It is a life sentence, but Papillon is determined to escape.  A first, rash attempt lands in solitary confinement for a harrowing two years, forcing him to plot the next escape more cunningly.The one bad thing about this set was the final movie, Tom Horn, not because it was a bad movie, but the disc was defective.  And, of course, there are plenty of other movies that could have merited inclusion, including The Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape, The Sand Pebbles and The Thomas Crown Affair.  Despite these issues, this is a fine set, enhanced by commentary tracks on The Cincinnati Kid, Bullitt and The Getaway, a biography on McQueen and a feature on film editing, one of the less appreciated elements of film making.  McQueen lived hard and died relatively young (at 50), so his film career was not very long; this set shows why he remains a screen legend.

$REVIEW.: HONDO.One of the better John Wayne westerns according to "LIFE AND TIMES OF THE WESTERN MOVIE" (and myself) is now available in DVD format. This Batjac production had been a collector's dream for a long time. Years ago I bought a VHS tape that did not satisfy me, but this DVD has got all it takes.In Hondo, John Wayne plays a cavalry dispatch rider who helps a lonely woman (Geraldine Chaplin) and her son (Lee Aaker) through an Indian uprising. Not a run-of-the-mill, cowboy versus Indians, this western shows a sympathetic view towards the Apaches who are gradually losing their way of life as the white men settle in the Southwest.Wayne's character, Hondo, who is part Indian is caught in a crossfire when he has to defend the woman and her small boy in a conflict between Victorio's Apaches and the Cavalry.Hondo is based on a novel by Louis Lamour and written by James Edward Grant. Director John Farrow had to quit his directorial assignment due to another engagement, so John Ford finished the movie unaccredited.This DVD is loaded with extras, such as interviews, trailers, commentaries, the making of Hondo in the Camargo, Mexico, desert. In one of the extras John Wayne's son explains how they cleaned each frame of the movie prior to transferring it to DVD.Watching it you will get to know some facets of John Wayne's personality that better explain why he stayed in the saddle so long and how he could fill the silver screen the way he did.

$REVIEW.: Great Marketing appears to have drawn the crowd to see this one. Blair Witch offers a creative cinematic perspective however this movie gets lost in a most boring sequence of camping events and one highly annoying female character. The acting is horrible and the plot nothing more than overreactive hysteria to a bunch of freaky nonsense and mind games. The ending is somewhat scary without alot of special effects..but not nearly as scary as it's hyped out to be. I have seen some very creative and scary films without the violence and splatter ... unfortunately, Blair Witch is not one of them.

 There he finds Mallory

She reminds him of his deceased daughter
He makes a decision to stay and help Mallory
 Besides his home life is non-existent:  His wife hasn't left the house in years and is a loveless marriage to Doug


 When he finally calls his wife to tell her he isn't coming home, that he has decided to stay there for awhile, his wife has to make a decision to finally be brave and leave the home and drive there


There is a funny scene where she backs out of the garage into the garbage can
She puts the car in drive and runs into a basketball pole
 She drives the car with the airbag hanging out


In New Orleans the Riley's rekindle their marriage

He tries to help Mallory leave the "stripper" world behind

 Mr


and Mrs
Riley leave after a blow-up with Mallory when she takes off on them

Once they are home they get a call from Mallory


 She has left and is in a bus depot going home

 Kristen Stewart is really good in this movie
She really nails the character of Mallory

 A must see.

$REVIEW.: "Tonight we love, while the moon beams down in dream light tonight."Lovely tune, one which takes its melody from a classical composition, as that stuffy English actor John Williams informed viewers in one of those commercials for multi-disc music collections so prominent on late night television in the late '60s and early '70s.In Alfred Hitchcock's "Saboteur," the song is incongruously performed by two spies as they drive suspected saboteur Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) and nerdily sinister Mr
Freeman (Alan Baxter) to New York, the setting for an exciting fast-paced climax


Only moments earlier, Baxter mentions having had golden curls as a child ("Everyone would stop in the street to admire me.")It's weird touches like these that make "Saboteur" a memorable example of good but less than top-flight Hitchcock


The 1942 film, the first that the Master of Suspense made for Universal (where he would produce and direct his last six films), is best known for the scene atop the Statue of Liberty where Kane faces off against Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd), the man responsible for the deeds for which Cummings is accused
But conspiracy watchers may find "Saboteur" more intriguing as an expose of America's true enemies: the elites, like the one played by smooth, cultured, ever so charming and perpetually amused Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger), who entertain in their penthouses while financing wars and revolutions meant to solidify their own power at the expense of the people, whom Tobin calls the "moron millions."The portrayal of such malevelont forces rings true in ways that other incidents in "Saboteur" do not
Kane's encounter with Philip Martin (Vaughan Glaser), the isolated blind man who offers him a meal and shelter (a little reminiscent of the Monster's encounter with the blind hermit in 1935's "Bride of Frankenstein"), is merely an opportunity for Kane to meet the requisite "love interest," Martin's glamourous niece played by top-billed Priscilla Lane
It may have also provided Hitchcock (or, perhaps, the screenwriters which included the legendary Dorothy Parker) to espouse liberal political philosophies that could easily have been mouthed by Tom Joad, the hero of John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath."With "Saboteur," Hitchcock is almost paying homage to himself, and especially his superior 1935 film, "The 39 Steps," the first of his thrillers to follow the exploits of a man wrongly accused of a crime, and determined to expose the true culprits

The performances are all exemplary, especially those of Kruger, Baxter, and Lloyd
The latter, who reminisces about the film in an informative "bonus feature," is as slimily sinister in "Saboteur" as he would be kindly, even saintly, as Dr
Aushlander on TV's superb "St


Elsewhere" in the '80s.Brian W


Fairbanks

$review_text.: This I think is one of the most unsettling horror films I've ever seen.  The person who directed it directed the Exorcist so he definately knows how to unsettle people.  It's not the violence that was unsettling because only three people get killed in the whole film.  What's unsettling about it was watching a man's descent into madness and watching him completely lose touch with reality.  Not only that, but watching how a man was able to plant some very powerful and absurd ideas into a lonely woman's head and even take things a step further, made it doubly unsettling.What I got out of the film is that a person's belief is a very powerful thing.  Our values, morals and principles can make or break us.  Everything which happens in this film can conceivably happen in real life.  I will not spoil the film by telling you that there are really no "Bugs" in the film, they were imagined.

$REVIEW.: I am so pleased with this movie -- it seemed to accurately portray the contradictions of the time period and the battle between the &#34;proper way&#34; and the &#34;necessary way&#34; that seemed to rear its head shamelessly during these decades


I would recommend it to anyone, realizing that there are many people who would greatly profit by seeing it but never would


But then again those folks probably wouldn't want to understand it even if they saw it.LOVE Forest Whitaker


He is brilliant in the way he conveys what can't be understood with words

And Oprah was a hoot, bold and perfect

What a movie!

$review_text.: The plot of this movie was cute. However, as cute as the kids are, there wasn't a whole lot of alienness to the film, except for a bit of telepathy. There's very little "magic" to the story. Also, much of the movie is really dark and the production quality wasn't great (admittedly, I saw it on DVD, not blu-ray, but still it was hard to see a lot of the darker scenes). Overall, I likedThe Last Mimzy (Widescreen Infinifilm Edition)better, which had a similar plot and a real air of mystery.

$review_text.: I was motivated to review thus primarily to give props to Barbara Hershey, whose character seems to be underappreciated in other reviews

I think that she most certainly is an important part of the plot


Yes, Dennis Hopper is good, but he doesn't even have all that much screen time.I think that this film was very tastefully made, with a good, somewhat appropriately stylized approach to the subject matter

I wouldn't call this the greatest sports movie of all time, but it's up there

It captures the spirit.

$REVIEW.: After the great first installment of Narnia, and the indifferent second one (of which I recall only very little, despite being released just a couple of years ago) this third episode in the series (that can be called Pirates of the Narnian Sea) is entertaining and enjoyable. Only two of the brothers are here (pretty Anna Popplewell appears in a couple of cameos) but this is almost make up by the presence here of cousin Eustace, providing good comic relief as a whiny spoiled brat. The big letdown, as in the other episodes, is Aslan, the insufferable Christ-Lion, with his obvious platitudes and third rate new age mysticism. The scene where the mouse goes happily into the kingdom of Aslan (that is, commits suicide) is among the worst scenes I seen in a mainstream movie in a long time. Fortunately, Aslan got relatively little screen time, so the movie is entertaining for most of the ride.

It is also from the vhs version of the wu tang collection but on dvd.The 3rd title is the best version dubbed in English, picture quality is excellent.This movie is very good like all the reviewers who give it 5 stars.There was a rumor back then that PART 2 was coming soon, by that time Jet Li was on his way to make other kung fumovies to become real famous then comes Black Mask which was for rent at chinese speaking movie rental shops inthe USA, this was before he appeared in that movie Lethal Weapon 4.So part 2 is even better than part one but it never was in production and the story was waiting for Jet Li tostar in it.

$REVIEW.: As a long time trekkie and avid watcher, I feel that I am well versed in both the individual series and the movies. Having said this, Star Trek VI: The undiscovered country, is quite possibly my favorite of the movies. It definitely competes well with First Contact and The Wrath of Khan for best plotlines and general story.Star Trek takes a vastly different ploy from the originals in that it initiates very serious undertones and a very plausible fear; a fear in which even the main characters are very much in danger at any point throughout the movie. Very gritty and surreal.The story begins in which a Klingon moon is destroyed in an accident, and henceforth dooms the empire without cooperation with starfleet. This sets an excellent precedent not only for this movie and series, but for the future series and movies to come. The Klingons are well played, with excellent performances from Christopher Plummer and others. This movie also induces a classical twist, with various Shakespearean and cultural references that actually come into play in various parts of my life.All in all, I would rate this in my top 5 of the star trek movies, and possibly even my #1. With the horror and dramatic effect of First Contact, and the rare epic nature of Wrath of Khan, this one definitely stands out in its own rite as a Classic Star Trek movie. I definitely recommend this film, and the series to go along with!

$review_text.: When I first saw "Dawn of the Dead" I believe I was 17. Even at that hardened age I was frightened. I began watch more of the Romero's films, all of his "Dead" films, and branched out to the Rubinstein spin-offs, "Return of the Living Dead." I'm not obsessed with the zombie movies, but since I was 12 years old I was trapped at a drive-in with my brother for a dusk to dawn movie run for Halloween where among other films, director Lucio Fulci's "Zombie" was playing, it changed the way I slept at night forever.With Romero at the helm, the zombie's are characters rather than background and the stories are strong. When I found this version of the DVD (I have the 2 disc set) I jumped to purchase it. Unfortunately since I live in the U.S. I didn't have a DVD player that ran Region 2 movies. Once I upgraded my DVD player I wasn't disappointed by the movie. I have both versions of the film on the 2-disc set and the director's cut is by far the best film in the "Dead" series.Now, because of Romero's vision, I'm always on the look out for other zombie films to scare the flesh from my bones. I recently (2003) found "Junk" from Japan and for anyone who loves zombie movies, need to check this out!

$review_text.: What happens when you mix children with their own companion alien, like Digimon and then you mix the disturbing psychology of Evangelion? The answer is this show, of course. First off, this is an unfinished anime and has only 4 episodes. There has not been any new episodes in nearly 10 years, so do not expect anything more from this series unless you read the manga, which is also unfinished.The art style of this anime looks similar to Azumanga Daioh, but the characters have really big ears and never seem to have noses on screen. The anime starts off rather pedestrian with three young girls who fight aliens with their own symbiotic aliens. Where did these aliens come from and why must they fight? The answers are never truly explained, so just go along with it. The anime would be alright with this premise, but the so-called main character cries a lot, and I mean a lot. She is like that because she seems to be afraid of everything that happens around, and she is definitely afraid of the aliens which makes her unable to fight on her own.The show becomes very strange and brutally violent by episode 2. Episode 4 is very psychological, and it is evident that it borrowed ideas from the later episodes of Evangelion. This show ends in a cliffhanger, and the viewer is just uncertain how to accept this show. It is an interesting show, but the ends do not justify the means. Anime like Lain and Boogiepop Phantom are more exceptional than this title.The DVD is distributed by Central Park Media (CPM) and there are no problems with the display of the DVD or the case. Its a standard CPM release, even with DVD extras like a talk with the English creative team, as well as the Japanese director. In conclusion, check this title out if you like deceptively cute anime that have dark elements to them (like Blood C.) However, do not buy this anime for children at all, regardless what you may see on the DVD case.

$review_text.: Marlene Dietrich stars as Bijou, a South Seas singer who keeps getting deported from different islands because her allure drives men to fight for her attention.  As she moves from place to place, she is accompanied by Broderick Crawford and Mischa Auer.  On one island, she meets and falls in love with Navy lieutenant John Wayne.  He falls for her as well, but her reputation makes her less than desirable company for those around him.  In the end, somebody must make a sacrifice.  Director Tay Garnett keeps the film moving along with plenty of action, stunning shots of Dietrich, and lots of South Seas atmosphere.  The over-the-top brawl at the end is the film's highlight.  Wayne, in one of his early major film appearances, does little more than look earnest, while Dietrich is as exotic as usual.  It's not a great film, but it is entertaining.

$review_text.: This science fiction favorite has been released several times before, on tape, laserdisc, and DVD. Fans have groused for years about the inferior quality of the prints, and with good reason: the original Technicolor film was photographed by F.A. Young, one of the great cinematographers of that era, and the movie itself is a grand, sweeping fairy tale story of mother love, the power of friendship, and destruction on a mass scale.This VCI release is minted from a lovely print that is a vast improvement over the existing versions, but the new DVD has an altered soundtrack, which can be terribly distracting: some irritating bell noise that repeats several times during the attacks, and the sound of rubble falling has also been inserted. Odd, and vexing. Though it's unlikely this little gem will ever get the deluxe restoration we've seen on Lawrence of Arabia, or The Wizard of Oz, it's a distinct pleasure to see this monster movie presented in this clear, crisp, and saturated version.If you've always admired "Gorgo", this print is a vast improvement, but be warned about those intrusive added sound effects. If you've never seen the film before, take a look, and be pleasantly surprised by the literate script, oddball character relationships, fascinating subtext, and stirring score by Angelo Lavagnino.Extras are plentiful: a "making of" photo documentary, coming attraction trailers, a photo gallery, and a delightful main menu. Maybe the next release will feature this great print, without a tampered track. We can only hope.

$review_text.: This is the original movie of this name. Most people are familiar with the 1944 American Version starring Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer & the screen debut of Angela Lansbury.Released in 1940 starring Anton Walbrook & Diane Wynyard this was as classic a tale then as it is now. I prefer it slightly over the American version as the storyline is a darker more abusive affair than America's. By the way Walbrook & Wynyard were big stars then & the acting is best in the British version.The story begins with a cruel & foul murder of an old woman knitting in her home. Young love causes a new bride to bring the husband she loves so dearly back to the house her murdered aunt had left to her years ago. No one had been willing to rent the place because of the evil crime. It stood empty & decaying for years despite it's location in Covent Gardens a very desirable location in London. The police had always been suspicious of the extensive damage done to the house & furnishings during the night of the murder & thought the old ladies rubies had disappeared with the killer.In this show it's all about the relationship of wife, husband, maid & the gems. Not to mention the old retired detective who remembered the case from back when & thought he recognized the wife's husband. A 5 star tale & well worth buying if you like your characters dark in a murder story. The disc I got had this 1940 version on 1 side & the 1944 American version on the other. Two worlds- One price. Enjoy!The offer page for the 1940 DVD has the synopsis for the American version that's why the stars names are wrong.

$review_text.: ***UPDATE*** I gave Justified a second chance and I have to say that I like it more now than at first viewing

I was coming off watching some classic TV like The Wire and Sopranos, and I was probably too hard on this one
Changing Two Stars to Three and a half

A solid and fairly well done show that gets better (in my opinion) at the end of the first season.***My Original Review*** My favorite shows have big themes and go for big concepts: The Sopranos, The Wire, The Shield, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Damages, Deadwood, even Dexter.I watched the first seven episodes of Justified and found it to be typical run-of-the-mill television fare with lot's of cliches, poor writing, complete lack of realism, stereotypical characters, etc


Olyphant is enjoyable to watch but if I'm going to watch TV I need better quality.Maybe I'm a TV snob
The first show seemed to be based on Elmore Leonard's short story and I liked it


But the writing took a nose dive after that first episode, and I quickly found myself wondering if the subsequent episodes were going to get better

In my opinion, they did not.I can't help feeling a show based in Kentucky or Appalachia could have gone the route of say, "Winters Bone", with colorful rural (but realistic) characters, themes of poverty, coal mining, isolation, etc
***SPOILER ALERT***: When Olyphant stood his ground with a sawed off shotgun aimed at him at point blank range and walked up and snatched it away from the bad guy, I completely lost interest in the show
Utterly simpleminded and ridiculous writing without an ounce of credibility.The episode about the rich guy and the evil wife and the "Hitler" paintings..

 cut me a break

***SPOILER ALERT***: She marries the guy for his money and then kills him and plans to run away

That plotline was old when Columbo, the Rockford Files and Magnum P.I
were on the air.Too bad


There was potential for an interesting show here.

$REVIEW.: &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is Quentin Tarantino once again tearing into a genre and producing something uniquely his and yet obviously made by a fan


This is an exciting, stylish and over-all original and fresh movie, the type of filmmaking we long for in an era of boring trends (teen movies) and repetitive action movies

Tarantino here combines his trademark skill in crafting witty, memorable dialogue with his surprisingly amazing eye for incredible action sequences

&quot;Kill Bill&quot; is not as complex or brainy as Tarantino's previous &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Jackie Brown,&quot; but it is a superb take on the martial arts genre filtered through the Tarantino membrane


It feels like an exploitation movie elevated to a higher art form because we still get Tarantino's genius for writing and storytelling

The cinematography by Robert Richardson (of Oliver Stone and Martin Scorsese fame) is rich and he beautifully lights every scene
The performances are also very skillfull for what essentially is a Kung-Fu flick

Uma Thurman is bold as The Bride, she lets us feel the strain both physically and mentally of her character


The entire film plays almost like classic drama, it is an exciting movie to watch and seeing it once is not enough


First it should be seen for the visceral experience, second for the dialogue, the performances and perfect timing of each scene
It's also fun to catch where Tarantino borrows from other movies to paste into his own
And it's all done with a great sense of style and craft


Watching a Tarantino film can be a special experience for most cinephiles because you get the feeling it's being made by a fan, by a guy who simply loves movies

&quot;Kill Bill Vol

1&quot; is an exhilarating action piece and awesome filmmaking craft


One can only imagine what &quot;Vol
2&quot; has in store for us.

All this time wasting really takes you right out of the movie, and almost ruins the enjoyment of them. If they wanted to split the movies into two parts for the sake of not requiring people to sit through a 3-hour movie, then they should have started &#34;part 2&#34; right away, instead of doing a recap and credits. If you want &#34;part 1&#34; and &#34;Part 2&#34; back-to-back, as I'm sure most will, then the recap and opening credits will really take you out of the movie. that's why I'm only rating this three stars.

$review_text.: Certainly an odd choice for a Will Ferrell vehicle, Land of the Lost is loosely based on a Saturday morning kid's show yet plays out like a raunchy gross-out adult comedy. Liking the burly comic is a must to ensure enjoyment, and accepting quantum paleontology, parallel dimensions, time machines, temperamental dinosaurs, telepathic reptilian aliens, and show tunes sure helps.Heavily ridiculed for his unorthodox methods and outlandish theories, paleontologist Rick Marshall (Will Ferrell) is practically expelled from the scientific community after a disastrously embarrassing interview with Matt Lauer. All but giving up on his ideas of time travel and dimensional warps, Marshall's appetite for discovery is reinvigorated upon meeting enthusiastic colleague Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel), who has ardently followed his teachings. Completing the tachyon amplifying device that comprised the heart of his studies, Rick, Holly, and dimwitted tour guide Will Stanton (Danny McBride) are transported during a "routine experiment" to a prehistoric alternate dimension where dinosaurs, cavemen, and lizard people roam free.Very little remains faithful to the original TV show source material (the film does open with an appropriately old Universal logo) other than the extremely cheesy situations, trace character designs and fantasy themes - Land of the Lost may be produced by Sid and Marty Krofft, but it's entirely a Will Ferrell film. His brand of immature but innuendo-filled humor will likely offend parents, bore young adults, and go over the heads of children. The few worthy laughs are dependent on references and insinuations to mature content but are likely to be dismissed for the overbearingly common universe-conquering plot. It's a one-man show (although bawdy-comedy regular Danny McBride has a few spotlight moments) that isn't as daring as Ferrell's usual works and toned down for the PG-13 rating - sadly it's also not completely family-friendly.With contrived plot jargon like tachyon-harnessing, transdimensional energy, quantum-paleontology and self-induced food comas, the show is unfortunately more cowardly nonsensical than inspiringly visionary as Marshall himself is described. Urine gags and queasy jokes are present for the sake of an independent laugh rather than to build upon a cleverly derived sequence and always rely on crudeness. It doesn't help that everyone easily outruns the T-Rex (repeatedly), language barriers are introduced but practically ignored, and every dilemma or antagonist presents zero real threat (perils can safely be avoided by spontaneous singing and dancing). It's insincere, un-severe and unintelligent - at least Anna Friel strips down to short shorts and a revealing tank top a few minutes after arriving in the land of the lost.- The Massie Twins

His summer is full of adventures and marvelous stories told by his uncles as he is becoming aware of what he wants.  Secondhand Lions is a young &quot;coming of age&quot; film in the style of Princess Bride (1987), which reaches the audience with its serious message through the use of far-fetched adventures and lessons in dialogue.  The director, McCanlies, creates a terrific cinematic link between young and old as he communicates his message of aging and living.

$REVIEW.: I bought this video to add to my growing collection of Vivien Leigh films. Of course, this is a must have. It captures Vivien before the Gone with the Wind phenomenon. On a whole, the plot was a bit slow and the sound quality made it difficult to understand all the actors, many of which have thick accents. What makes this film worthwhile is Vivien's performance. She truly carries the film! Vivien Leigh only made a handful of films, and it is interesting to hear the change in her voice. In her last few films her voice is husky, an effect of her habitual smoking. Though, in her earlier films, like DARK JOURNEY, her voice is light and almost musical. DARK JOURNEY is a must have for any serious Vivien Leigh fan!

The discs may just be copies of the original Blu Ray discs, so it could be a hard purchase if you already own those. However what I did was sell those original copies so I could own all three held together in a nice box.

$REVIEW.: The Kyoto Arc of the Rurouni Kenshin series is arguably where manga artist/author Watsuki Nobuhiro reached his peak
We get more details about Kenshin's past than ever before, some beautiful artwork, incredible new characters, and some of the best fight scenes ever to be illustrated.And luckily for the fans, the anime series brought the Kyoto Arc to life with style and substance to spare
The First volume, Shadow of the Wolf, starts the second season out with a bang, introducing both Kenshin's old rival, Hajime Saito, and his replacement-turned-renegade, Makoto Shishio, to name but two.However, the real draw of this DVD is not the story, nor the character development (thought both are pulled off wonderfully by their japanese and english performers) but the deathmatch between Kenshin and Saito that stretched over two episodes


This is most likely the single best duel ever put to celuloid, bar none, and features not only insane acrobatics, but great detail, and a peek at the legendary Hitokiri Battousai.The extras on this disk are fairly standard fare, but the main draw is the anime itself, and it doesn't dissappoint
A must own for any RK fan.

$review_text.: After a long abscence Jodorowsky returned with this surreal, but more accessible offering than his earlier work; focusing on a circus, and starring Jodorowsky's son and grandson as Fenix, a young boy who witnesses his father cut off the arms of his mother before commiting suicide.Then we see Fenix grown up and finding his mother again, and she uses him as her slave, using his hands for her various needs and also to commit murder


There are the trademark Jodorowsky images in parts, with deformed people on a trip out from an asylum, and powerful scenes like an elephant being savaged for food; but it somehow has a more warmer and humble feel to it than his previous work.

$review_text.: By now, you've read the storyline of this flick in the other reviews, so no need to repeat here.  I WILL say that it's interesting to see how the film makers were trying to make Leatherface a more formidable killer than he was in the first 2 movies.  He's less childish and not as skitterish this time around, and that makes him more intimidating.  It's weird to see California doubling as Texas, but hey...you'll get used to that soon enough in this film.The documentaries are interesting and explain a LOT about how this movie came to be, the thinking behind it, and what worked and didn't.  The impression I got was that the studio saw Leather face as another Jason or Freddy, and just didn't understand that he's very different from either.  He has NO personality.  That's the point of the mask.  It IS his persona.  They tried to make him into something he's not, and it didn't quite work.  As a retrospective on early '90s horror films and the efforts that went into them, the documentaries are more than worth the price of this dvd.  i find myself watching it quite a bit when there's nothing on the boob tube late at night (which is pretty damned often).You'll definitely want to get this dvd if you're a fan of Chainsaw films and the history behind them.

$review_text.: DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS is a great comedy. Martin &amp; Caine have terrific on-screen chemistry and their performances in this film can still reduce me to a squalking, teary-eyed viewer. Terrific pacing keeps this movie buoyant at all times, even as the movie approaches its 20th anniversary.There are two DVD editions. The first was from Orion/Image. It was a &quot;no-frills&quot; release, containing the movie only. Mercifully, that version is out of print although I have seen some unscrupulous sellers hyping that fact as a selling point. Don't be fooled.Get the current edition on MGM DVD. Watch out for similar cover artwork. The current MGM offering has Martin &amp; Caine standing in front of palm trees. (The no-frills disc has them standing in front of a bunch of beach umbrellas.)With the current edition, you will enjoy an anamorphic widescreen transfer (better image quality than standard letterboxing). They are also including the original teaser trailer which brilliantly set up one's expectations without revealing ANY of the actual movie. Frank Oz (director) provides an interesting scene-by-scene audio commentary.Enjoy!

Thats the kind of creative resolution I liked to see. I love Flynn and Provenza. I enjoy the relationship they have and how it relates to the squad. My favorite is Sanchez. I've always enjoyed Raymond Cruz and in this series he not only is great as a detective, but he has always been the most sensitive one there and I enjoy that in a character and a man. Hated to see this series end.

$REVIEW.: It's true that Lina doesn't date well - her politics are so out in front
 But if one understands and loves Italian culture, there's much to be savored in such films as PASQUALE SEVEN BEAUTIES and this gem from the  mid-seventies

 Please don't be distracted by any ranting from humorless PC  types who don't get the joke: their snorts are the equivalent of a gay  politico thinking MR


RIPLEY was homophobic
 Ennio Guaneri's  cinematography here is splendid, but the  greatest element (alonsgide  Melato's performance - that queen of Milanese cynicism) is Piero Piccioni's  ethereal guitar and bossa-nova score as directed by Berto Pisano (composer  of &quot;Kill Them All&quot;)
One should be so lucky as to own a copy of  this soundtrack
 I hope Lina can make a comeback stateside since her fall  from favor in '79 with A NIGHTFULL OF RAIN
 The lady studied under  Fellini, and she has a probing social conscience, which is more than can be  said for most US filmmakers chasing a buck.

$review_text.: So many negative reviews & low scores based solely on the fact that the remade versions were already released on DVD.So what.If you don't like the new versions then you shouldn't have bought them; instead of buying something you didn't want & knocking the classic versions now only because you're upset with having spent the money. You could have stuck with the VHS box set, or some fan-restored LD to DVD classic version. Sorry to tell you that LucasFilm is a business - making money is what they do. Staggering the release of 2 different versions of a DVD has really become standard practice...to make more money. When the first box set came out Lucas wasn't planning on ever releasing the originals again (watch interviews with him - he's downright embarrassed by the technical qualities of the original movies, like he wants to hide them), so this new set is really an unexpected blessing for old-school fans.These are the classics. These are what I remember from my youth. The Max Rebo & Ewok songs in their full glory.I already own the other DVD set, and that's cool. It's worth owning both just to see the differences between Lucas' original and "true" visions. I did the same thing with the Lord of the Rings - happily bought both versions of each movie.If they had offered the originals at the same time as the remade DVDs, I would have picked these instead, but oh well. Now there'll be 3 more DVDs to display on the shelf - showing my fandom to all who enter my living-room.I'm glad they're over-turning what Lucas had said years ago - that the VHS box set would be the last-ever release of the original versions.The fans have spoken, and what the fans want are the classics, which is what they're delivering, so thumbs up.

$review_text.: This is a bare bones, paint-by-numbers plot (that blatantly rips off Star Wars a few times).  Nothing that happens is interesting, exciting or entertaining, and none of the characters are memorable in any way.  There's no humour of note and the dialogue is a bore.But.....once that princess goes into the dragon's lair.....man oh man!  From that point on it really is quite incredible.  These effects for a dragon in 1981?  It seems impossible.  The dragon really looks great.  The way it crawls, flies, breathes fire...it's all so right!If I had fast-forwarded to the "princess-goes-into-cave" bit and watched from there...I would be thinking 5 stars.  But, unfortunately I slogged through until then (at which point I was not enjoying the film at all), so 3 stars it is.I suggest you fast-forward until that point.  Here's what you miss:  Old wizard is hired to kill a dragon; one of the king's men wants to stop him; wizard allows himself to be murdered by the king's man; his apprentice takes up the quest; apprentice meets girl pretending to be a boy in order to get out of "the lottery" where the "winning" virgin is sacrificed to the dragon in order to spare the village; apprentice is locked up by the king, who fears if he fails the dragon will not be happy; princess figures out the lottery has been rigged for years to omit the rich families' virgins (including herself); she nobly rigs the next lottery so that all the names are her own; girl-who-was-pretending-to-be-a-boy's father is a blacksmith, who happens to have previously forged a spear called the "Dragon Slayer", gives it to the apprentice; girl-who-was-pretending-to-be-a-boy bravely makes a dragon-scale shield for apprentice.And at that point...you should start watching.  It probably took about a minute to read that, I just saved you about 90 minutes of tedium.  But make sure you do get to see this dragon.  It's awesome.

$review_text.: When I first heard the concept behind Phone Booth, I wondered how the film makers would be able to make a full-length film out of the concept of a guy getting stuck in a phone booth because a psycho sniper wants to shoot him.  Then I found out that the film is only 81 minutes long.  Couldn't they have padded it out to a more respectable 90 minutes?  I guess that the film makers ultimately were not able to make a full-length movie.  At several points in the film the action seemed rushed, like the film makers were trying to set land speed records for getting to the end of the story.This movie is a precursor to 2004's Cellular--the other movie about someone who has to stay on the phone in order to try to stay alive.  Neither of these phone-thriller films are great, but I liked Cellular better than Phone Booth.  In addition to its too-short running time, Phone Booth uses the tired Hollywood trope of the super-sneaky super-criminal who sets up the perfect crime.  The first couple of times watching films about these sneaky super-criminals were fairly entertaining, but by the time we get to Phone Booth, this idea has been well-worn and Phone Booth doesn't really have that much to add.  The super-criminal sets up everything perfectly and even the random events all work in his favor.  Nothing in life is that perfect and this film would have been a lot more interesting if things worked out less perfectly for the super-criminal.Then there is the question of why Collin Farrell's character ended up in the odd situation of being stuck in phone booth while being threatened by a sniper that he can't see.  At one point, the main character asks the villain why he was targeted and the villain explains that the main character is a rude jerk and he needs to be taught a lesson.  Now considering that the villain is some kind of vigilante who wants to make the world a better place, why would he set his sights so low and pick on some poor lout?  Yes, the main character is rude and borish and is in the process of working up to having an affair, but in grand scheme of things, are these flaws worth the super-villain's grand standing or the audience's attention?  If you are in the mood for a thriller involving a situation where someone's life depends on a phone call, I would recommend the film Cellular instead--it's not a great film, but it is better than Phone Booth.

In the hopes of raising enough money to replace it, he and his friend Grover Mockridge (Bud Abbott) visit a gambling parlor


They are successful in raising the money, but before they can purchase a new horse, a con man swindles Wilbur out of his cash.They are informed by some touts that an old horse is available for nothing at one of the tracks


They visit the track and mistakenly take the wrong horse, a champion by the name of Tea Biscuit


They present the horse to O'Hara as a replacement for his deceased horse.The horse's real owner, Colonel Brainard (Samuel Hinds) offers a reward for Tea Biscuit
By this time O'Hara has taken a fare up to Saratoga
Wilbur and Grover, realizing their error, drive to Saratoga


The three touts also realize that Wilbur and Grover took Tea Biscuit, and trail them hoping to recover the horse and collect the reward

Wilbur and Grover manage to find O'Hara and hide Tea Biscuit in their hotel room
But they are hounded by the house detective, Warner, who was tipped off by the touts
Wilbur and Grover head to the race track in time for a big race

Grover makes a deal with Warner: for $100 he will give him the horse Wilbur rides
Grover then uses that money to bet on Tea Biscuit
Before the race, Wilbur is thrown off Tea Biscuit and lands on Rhubarb
Tea Biscuit, with a real jockey aboard, wins the race
Wilbur rides Rhubarb and loses
Warner and the touts take Wilbur's horse, which they believe is Tea Biscuit, to Colonel Brainard for the reward, but it is the wrong horse
Grover holds the only winning ticket on Tea Biscuit, and uses their winnings to buy O'Hara a real replacement horse.TRIVIA:(1) There is a scene that breaks the fourth wall: Wilbur and Grover are in their apartment when someone knocks at the door

Grover says, "Go answer the door, it might be Warner." Wilbur answers, "It won't do no good, we're signed up with Universal." Abbott and Costello had a long term contract with Universal Studios at the time.(2) It Ain't Hay is based upon the Damon Runyon story, Princess O'Hara, which Universal first made into a film in 1935 with Chester Morris.(3) Filming of this picture began on September 28, 1942, and lasted until November 11

Lou's brother Pat was used as his stunt-double in the 'headless horseman' sequence.(4) It was during production, on November 6, that Lou's wife, Anne, gave birth to their son, Lou 'Butch' Costello, Jr.(5) It Ain't Hay was released on DVD on October 28, 2008 as part of Abbott and Costello: The Complete Universal Pictures Collection


The film's studio-authorized DVD release had been delayed for many years due to legal issues with the estate of Damon Runyon.

$review_text.: I didn't really know what to expect going into this movie, but I was sure it would be a good time. Boy was I right. It's hard to really explain the movie without spoiling things, but suffice to say that it is a wild ride, and a movie that any horror fan should see at least once. You can tell the moviemakers are fans of the genre because it shows in the DNA of the movie.The special features are very good as well. I'm usually completely underwhelmed by that kind of stuff in recent releases, but there is a great commentary with the filmmakers, and there is some fun behind the scenes stuff.

$review_text.: I was maybe ten when Gia died. Needless to say I had never heard of her when this movie came out. But being a huge fan of Angelina Jolie I watched it. After it was over I just sat there thinking (a sign of a very good  movie in my opinion). I had run the gamet of every emotion possible in just  two hours. I felt like I had just met someone quite amazing and they told  me their life story.  Angelina Jolie has proven herself in the past as an  amazing actress, but this film established her as a master of the craft. No  one could have come close to the power she radiates while showing us who  Gia was. I don't say &quot;plays Gia&quot; because it was definitly more  than portraying a character. She became Gia.  I hate when people categorize  this movie as &quot;lesbian/ gay film&quot;, because it generalizes a very  complex emotional human being. Gia wasn't just a lesbian, she was a model,  a friend, a daughter, and a lover.  If you want to experience the human  condition, it's joy and pain, watch Gia. It truly is a work of art. And  Angelina Jolie is an artist.

$REVIEW.: There is alot to say about this fine movie (my thanks to the director, Martin Brest for slowing things down ), but I'll focus on the big impact for me - Claire Forlani and her complete, breathtaking beauty. Claire Forlani in her evening gown at the end of the movie is one of the most powerful images of femininity I can recall - the way she looks, the way she moves, her control, lack of control, and the things she says, are all stunning to behold.But thats not where she's the most attractive.  Like several other reviewers, I first came across "Meet Joe Black" while I was changing channels on the TV.  When I saw Claire Forlani come into the coffee shop, in her ugly gray t-shirt, no hair styling, little makeup, I couldn't tear myself away.  This amazing vignette is for me, some of the most compelling footage I've ever seen.  Her every glance, movement, in/exhale seems to communicate emotions that build as the scene unfolds as she takes in and responds to this young man she's just met.  Lightning struck me too!  Wow.  (The only thing that seemed unnatural was when the two part company without either of them following up!)Watching Clair Forlani in this movie changed my image of beauty and femininity.  I hope she's given more opportunities to display her talent, poise, and stunning appearance.Whenever I hear Thomas Newman's magnificent score for this movie, I think of Ms. Forlani and her graceful beauty.
$SUMMARY.: Claire Forlani... Wow!

$REVIEW.: Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting a quality anaglyphic 3D or even an excellent Pulfrich effect film with this DVD.  Instead, you will get a decent, though now outdated, documentary on various top coasters of the early 1990s.  I do agree the hosts are not all that great, being that their dialog is clearly scripted instead of free-flowing on-the-moment acting.  But, putting that aside, you do get a good doco on the coasters with on-ride views.  First of the host and passengers, then a forward view from the first car.  Sadly, for a DVD that claims to have "Thrills in 3-D", there isn't any.  You get two sets of Pulfrich glasses, which rely on fast movement to give the dimensional affect.  There is plenty of that, but no depth whatsoever.  You get a better, and much more enjoyable, Pulfrich 3D in the relaxation film, Pure Pleasure 3-D.  It can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/Pure-Pleasure-3D-Thomas-Blakeslee/dp/B00015YWA8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1328401841&sr=8-1.  Also, the picture quality of this coaster disc is not DVD worthy in clarity.  Looks more like a VHS-to-disc conversion, which is probably what it is.  In short, if you want a decent coaster documentary for your archive, then this DVD is worth having since some of the coasters on it are gone now.  But don't buy this DVD for any 3D and image clarity viewing.  For the best in coaster DVDs, get the six Theme Park Review discs called "Coasters In The Raw".

$review_text.: Some of the sailing footage is fun to watch
My favorite is the 14's racing in Newport


The love story part of the film is silly and its adaptation to a sailing context is strained, but where the movie very  seriously loses it, in my view, is in the weird depiction of  &quot;technical&quot; aspects of sailing


For the most part, this is  downright embarrassing.The funniest is when they come up with the  innovative &quot;whomper&quot; sail
I have heard non-racers comment on the  movie to the effect of &quot;Why didn't the other racers think of that  sail?&quot; to which the answer is, of course: &quot;It's against the  rules.&quot; But I have to thank &quot;Wind&quot; for coming up with my  favorite nick-name for asymetrical spinnakers!

$review_text.: The concept seems original at first but the more you watch the more you realize that this movie is little more than "The Matrix" meets "Vanilla Sky." Now, these were both cool movies but that's, in part, because they were both original at the time. Aside from this, "Inception" is a very complex story which end up being kind of slow. Plus, (unless I just missed something, which is possible) there seemed to be some holes in the plot. On the visual side, there were some very impressive camera tricks but that, alone, does not a good movie make. Based on people raving about this movie, I had expected something more.Not bad but not recommended.

$review_text.: Ever sinceSpider-Man The New Animated Series: Season Onewas cancelled I've been waiting for another series with the same cell shaded look. This series fits the bill. The brilliant computer generated artwork looks like a comic book on your TV.The story is also closely related to the Spider-Man series from a couple years back: Tony Stark is in school and fighting crime on the side with a trusted friend and a girl who may or may not be his girlfriend.I was never a fan of Iron Man growing up so I never collected comics that featured him other than the occasional cross over. So most of the villains are new to me. Some who have been big fans of Iron Man may bring too much baggage to enjoy this re-imagining. I don't suffer from that so I really enjoy this series.My 3 year old son and I watch these all the time on Netflix streaming. Highly recommended for superhero fans of all ages.

$review_text.: Sometimes even if you don't get what a filmmaker is trying to do, you like the result.  And then sometimes you do get it, but don't like it.  This film has half a dozen totally unlikeable characters, all narcissistic artists - is that redundant?  The beautiful but way quirky gallery owner has one brother (Eion Bailey) whose art is very commercial but it keeps her financially flush.  She doesn't like him or his art all that much, instead she likes the bizzarro artists of modern style.  You know the type.  Stick a cigarette on the wall, give it a name and call it art.  Well the gallerist (Marley Shelton), does like the brother of her bread winner (Adam Goldberg) who's as nutso about his music as the guy sticking the ciggy on the wall is about art.  I understand how this is a satire about art snobs, but I found the whole thing rather tedious if not odious.

Leslie Howard, one of the stars of -Gone With the Wind- and Pygmalion, is wonderful as the English Superhero. He gives the character a sneeky humor and charm that sets the character alive. Barry K. Barnes also gives a good performance in the often overlooked sequel, The Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel- which manages to tie up the unresolved elements of the first movie. Look for a young James Mason in it. All in all, good clean entertainment about heroism in post revolution France. Also, there is a nice collection of cartoons and movie trailers on this DVD.

$review_text.: If the "Faerie Tale Theatre" version of "HANSEL AND GRETEL" is too dark, spooky, and scary for you and/or your children, this excellent Cannon Movie Tales version will be an entertaining alternative. This version is more directly inspired by Humperdink's operetta rather than the original Brothers Grimm story.Hansel and Gretel (Hugh Pollard and Nicola Stapleton) have a biological mother (Emily Richard). She is not evil or wicked. She is merely harried because she and her family are on the brink of starvation. In desperation, she sends the children out into the woods to find berries to eat. When her husband (David Warner; "THE OMEN", "A CHRISTMAS CAROL") returns home with an unexpected bounty of food, she immediately realizes the mistake she has made and reacts with a mixture of panic and fear for the safety of the children.Emmy and Oscar-winner Cloris Leachman is a hoot as the Witch who traps the kids in her delicious house of gingerbread and candy. At first, she comes across as a sweet, albeit grotesque-looking, Granny-type. But, shortly after midnight, Gretel discovers her true wicked witchy ways. After she is conquered, her gingerbread house explodes in a spectacular scene.Be sure to have plenty of candy handy when you watch this movie. Like the classic 1971 "WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY", there are so many delectable desserts on visual display here, your mouth will water!!

$review_text.: This has got to be one of the best black comedies I have ever seen

For the first part of the movie I could not help but laugh out loud

It is hilarious!But (not having read the book) guess who got sucked in and suckered out with the ending? This is class in a glass


The music, the clothes, the Master of the Universe yuppies all go to build a great background


Then there is Patrick Bateman (an outstanding performance by Christian Bale but more on that later)- a designer quoting, 1000 stomach crunches a day, body exfoliating and facial masking kind of corporate success you could see anywhere in the 80s.But of course Patrick is different
He kills: he kills with hammers, axes, staple guns (a real big one), chain saws


He decapitates, delimbs, hangs bodies up in his closet or just shoots them


This is all done in such a stylised way that it is funny - not horrific.But strongest of all is his narcissism
Because Patrick is just another screwed up yuppie who dreams all these murders, who cannot tell the difference between reality and a daydream but who is really no different to all his other peers.I loved this movie because it took me in one direction (the black comedy, the blood, the psychosis of a man losing control) but then it kicked me back to a very cerebral and deeply intuitive understanding of human nature and the rage within.Best of all was Christian Bale who I must admit I had not seen since Empire of the Sun


After you watch this DVD look at his interview
The difference between the character he plays and the actor himself is amazing to watch
What a performance, what an actor.So give your self a good kick up the backside and watch this.

$REVIEW.: The Vietnam War has been a constant source of inspiration for writers, moviemakers, songwriters and singers for many years now.  We've had the Viet Vet home from the war story in "The Deer Hunter," the LSD drenched, hallucination of "Apocalypse Now," as well as "Platoon," "Full Metal Jacket," and the recent "Tigerland" to name several.  Even Oliver Stone's "JFK" is partly, a thought provoking treatise not only on JFK's assasination but on Lyndon Johnson's motives in regards to the US's initial involvement in Vietnam. "Soldiers" is not concerned with the whys at all but with the hows and the wherefores."We Were Soldiers" is fascinating on several fronts: first of all it takes place in 1965 after the defeat of the French in "Indo-China," while all the other films dealing with the Vietnam conflict are "en medias res" or in the 1970's. Secondly the Mel Gibson character, Hal Moore is not only a Colonel...but a Harvard scholar and war tactician.  Upon receiving his orders to Vietnam, he researches the French's massacre there as well as that of George Custer at Little Bighorn.  In fact Moore's Regiment is assigned the number 7...the same as Custer's.We, along with Moore, are thus filled with a deep feeling of dread and forboding much like that engendered by Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) as he makes his way towards Col. Kurtz's lair in "Apocalypse Now."Much has been made concerning the battle scenes; and yes they are as graphic as anything in "Saving Private Ryan" but the director, Randall Wallace and producer, Mel Gibson should be congratulated for not pulling back from the horror and carnage especially since at several points it seems that Moore's regiment might indeed fall victim to the same fate as Custer's. This film is the exact opposite of the recent "Black Hawk Down" in that the war in "WWS" is fought on the foot soldier level with Moore right on the scene giving orders and strategizing.The " Back Home" scenes are handled well: barely missing going overboard into the corny and maudlin. Madeline Stowe is stoic, sympathetic and quite beautiful as Moore's wife Julie, who nobly takes it upon herself to deliver the "US Government regrets to inforn you that" telegrams that arrive for the surviving wives."We Were Soldiers" is ultimately then, a revisionist war movie; one that harkens back to those of the 1940's like "Iwo Jima" and "Back from Bataan" in which the American foot soldier is glorified and enobled but it also serves as a reminder that all wars are ultimately paid for with the universal currency of human lives.

$review_text.: Let me just confess that I missed this one; don't even know if it hit the theaters.  It flew under my radar and, if it weren't for the Blu-ray and DVD release, I would have never known about it. And it would have been a shame, because "Adventures in Zambezia" rocks! This is one truly entertaining and funny animated movie for the whole family, that come to us from South Africa, of all places.The story takes place in the beautiful African landscape, where we immediately meet young Kai and his father Tendai, two intrepid falcons that are freely flying in the majestic sky of the savannas and canyons. Tendai is teaching Kai to improve his flying and hunting techniques. The father is a little angry, because his son doesn't follow instructions and is not careful enough. Once they return to their nest, they have an argument, because Kai wants to be more able to explore and see new places. Tendai leaves the nest, and leaves Kai alone for a while. It is at this time that they receive the unexpected visit of one of Tendai's old friends, who is carrying some pigeons with her. She is running away from two vultures-like birds who want to capture the pigeons. Tendai's friend tells Kai that they are on the way to Zambezia, which is the best, safe place to live, a "paradise for birds." Once Tendai returns to the nest, his friend leaves, because they had a disagreement - Tendai had bad memories about Zambezia. Kai, however, wants to go and see that fabulous place, and departs by himself - against his father's will -- in search of this promised land. Once he safely arrives to Zambezia, he discovers that it is indeed a great place. Furthermore, he wants to join "The Hurricanes," the "air force" that protects Zambezia, and which is comprised of the best of the best, the strongest birds in the colony. However, Kai's visit to Zambezia coincides with Budzo's (a giant lizard) plan to conquer this paradise. At the same time, Kai will learn things about his past which will play a role in his future."Adventures in Zambezia" has nothing to envy from the animation made by US studios. I have read commentaries that claim that the animation is a little outdated. I don't think so. The animation and script are sound, with a story involving good versus evil, with a love story in between. And the colors and landscapes are just awesome. Give it a try; you won't be disappointed. Plus, the voices are from Hollywood actors, such as Samuel Jackson, Leonard Nimoy, Abigail Breslin, Jeff Goldblum, and others. This is as good as it gets. The Blu-ray includes four featurettes and a music video (South Africa, 2012, color, 82 min plus additional materials).Reviewed on March 18, 2013 by Eric Gonzalez for Sony Blu-ray

$review_text.: This movie is a lot more fun than Jailhouse Rock and Viva Las Vegas
I could almost say it's better than Wild in the Country
They're definitely in competition.This was before Wild in the Country and he's a better actor in this

Sad Wild came later

Elvis wasn't that good of an actor but he was an entertainer and he succeeds on that level in this movie.Unlike Wild, this movie moves at a good pace

It is loaded with songs, lipsynced but it's still fun to watch them

Elvis plays a troubled country boy whose talent is discovered by Lizabeth Scott
Even in 1957, Lizabeth was still beautiful

She plays a half villian type role
The noir movies in the 40's were more suited for her but she pulls this off okay

Dolores Hart, who later was cast in "Where the Boys Are", gives a nice performance also as a pretty innocent country girl.Wild in the Country is unintentionally funny all the way
But if you want a movie more closer to the definition of good I would go for this one

The last ten minutes are quite silly though.

$REVIEW.: I have Saints Season Tickets and actually attended the New England and Atlanta Games

 It is great to see the games again as they led to the Super Bowl victory
 The 3 stars is because the games are not in HiDef as they were on broadcast TV

I know it can be done, because the Florida BCS championship DVDs that I have are in "widescreen"
 That being said, it was a wonderful season and I love having these games as a souvenir

$REVIEW.: Rarely does a novel translate well into a screen production. &quot;The Quiet American&quot; proves to be the exception to the rule. Philip Noyce and his team have brilliantly adapted Graham Greene's historical novel about Vietnam, during the waning days of French colonialism and the beginning of American intervention, into a powerful film. The book was published in 1955 and foreshadowed America's war in Vietnam. Kudos go to Michael Caine, who certainly deserves an Oscar for his spectacular performance.The movie is set in Saigon during 1952. Thomas Fowler, (Michael Caine), a cynical, veteran correspondent for The London Times is our narrator. Fowler has &quot;gone native.&quot; He has fallen in love with Vietnam and with Phoung, a one-time bar hostess who is young enough to be his daughter. Enter Alden Pyle, (Brendan Fraser), a seemingly innocuous, somewhat bumbling American who supposedly works for the US Economic Aid Mission, specializing in eye diseases. The two men meet and become friends until Pyle intrudes on Fowler's love affair.Tension builds as this triangle becomes more intense, and as the war between the French and the Communists is joined by a third party, a Vietnamese general, backed by the Americans.  Fowler, who has long remained indifferent to the conflict is finally forced to take sides. Pyle is drastically transformed from a &quot;quiet&quot; American to a skilled  CIA operator, willing to condone the deaths of innocents for long term political interests.This is an intensely passionate film. The love both Fowler and Pyle feel for Phuong, (played by the incredibly lovely Do Thi Hai Yen) transforms both men. In one scene, when Fowler realizes his potential loss, he says, &quot;The fear of losing Phoung is more terrifying than any bullet. If I lose her, it would be the beginning of death.&quot; And it is a film passionate about the war being fought on the streets of Saigon and in the villages. Director Noyce is able to portray the conflict in simple enough terms without taking a strong political stance. This film is anti-war not anti-American.Graham Greene's haunting and elegant narrative comes to life here. The photography eloquently captures the steamy beauty of Saigon, the glorious tropical countryside, the serenity of Phoung's face in close-up, the chaos of a bomb-torn street and the horror of a village massacre. One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Highly recommended!JANA

$review_text.: Best wrestling PPV ever?  That was the heavily debated question after this PPV


 If it wasn't the best ever, it was darn near close


 Wrestlemania 17 is a 2 disc set
 Disc 1 and part of 2 contains the matches and the rest of 2 is extras.1

Chris Jericho vs


William Regal (Intercontinental Championship)These two built up quite the comical fued before this match
 Good match
 Good way to open up the show

 (7.5/10)2
APA & Tazz vs

Right To CensorNothing really happened in this match


 Right To Censor is horrible


 (5/10)3


Kane vs


Raven vs
Big Show (Hardcore Championship - Triple Threat)Very entertaining match that went all over the arena
 Good bumps taken by Raven (thrown through glass, hit by a golf cart)

 Very good finish to the match as all 3 men take good bumps
 (8.5/10)4

Test vs

Eddie Guerrero (European Championship)Surprisingly entertaining match from Test

 The match is pretty short

 (7.5/10)5

Kurt Angle vs


Chris BenoitAnother technical classic between these two


 Starts up as a pure wrestling match

 This was actually voted as the 10th best Wrestlemania match by WWE superstars before Wrestlemania 20

 These two have such great chemistry together
 Bad ending


 (9/10)6

Chyna vs


Ivory (WWF Womens Championship)Who cares?  (1/10)7

Shane McMahon vs


Vince McMahon w/Mick Foley as Special Guest Referee (Street Fight)Very, very exciting match


 The crowd was into this match from the beginning

 Amazing

 Crazy bumps taken by both men


 Shane jumps off the top rope through an announce table, and also delivers a Van Daminator to Vince with the use of a trash can


 There are many surprising twists and turns that occur during this match

 (9.5/10)8
Edge & Christian vs
Hardy's vs


Dudley's (Tag Team Championship - TLC)One of the best matches of the year, although it is not exciting as TLC I

 It is still great in its own right

 Spike Dudley, Rhyno, and Lita all make appearances in this match


 To many crazy spots and bumps to note
 Watch for the Edge spear off the ladder on Jeff hanging from the belt


 Maybe the best move ever

 (9.5/10)9
Gimmick Battle RoyalThis match featured past WWF superstars

 Good nostalgia


 (8/10)10
Triple H vs


UndertakerThis match was not a Street Fight, but turned into one when the ref gets knocked out
 The match spills into the crowd


 Triple H takes a good bump getting choke slammed off a scaffold
 Very exciting ending
 (9/10)11

The Rock vs

Stone Cold Steve Austin (WWF Title - No DQ)Great match
 Match of the year in my opinion

 These two really went at it


 There is a lot of blood, reversals, and close falls

 Great finish, although very surprsing

 Great match


 (10/10)The extras on disc 2 are the normal interviews, superstar moments, and RAW the next night.I definately recommend picking this up, although it is very hard to find and expensive


 Definately one if not the best PPV ever.Overall Rating:  9.5/10

$REVIEW.: True Romance is one of the most overlooked movies of the 90's.  Unfortunately it was not a commercial success.  It's estimated budget was 13 million and box office returns were around 12.2 million.  Who knows why.  My opinion is that it was poorly marketed and studios didn't quite know what to do with this ultra violent, sharp dialogue style that became synonymous with Tarantino.  However it has achieved a certain cult status since it's release as more people came to realize Tarantino's involvement.Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay and Tony Scott directed. Boy did the two of them deliver.  Each character has a diamond sharp set of lines to deliver that are worthy dialogue for a lead.  The cast is full of A-list celebrities and performances that will be burned into your memory for life.  Gary Oldman as Drexel the pimp with racial identity issues, the epic sit down between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, and Alabama's compelling sincerity are a few of the many stand out elements in this wonderful film.  Even Samuel L gets one of his classic cameos in the beginning.What more can I say without ruining this movie for those who haven't seen it?  Part of what makes it so special is all the surprises.  So I suggest you sit back, relax, and suspend disbelief while you are taken on a very strange and very satisfying ride through a lesser known piece of the Quentin Tarantino universe.

Special effects are nice, and despite the differences between movie and book, this is still a good movie. Not everyone is going to love it, but I found it an enjoyable film, and the actor who played Caspian did a nice job. I also liked the scene in the beginning that explained why Miraz wanted Caspian dead, it offered a bit more depth than the one in the book.

$REVIEW.: You already know all about this movie from the other reviews, I will just add a personal stance on the "being" channelled by JZ Knight: it's a load of rubbish.Everything this plastic-surgery inflicted woman said the whole way through the film was utterly contrived and self-important and devoid of truth, at times (especially toward the end) even diverging away from said truth to a harmful extent; it was only vindication to discover during the credits that this woman decided to present her words in the form of the channelling of an ultra-dimensional entity called Ramtha, who no doubt runs seminars and classes in Beverly Hills for $3,500 a session.Apart from this woman, give the DVD a watch and a listen with an open mind and see what you think. One or two of the contributors add unworthy and unwelcome opinions on such things that they should refrain from, and it is testament to the integrity of the others when they freely admit that some things are simply beyond them and that they have nothing concrete to offer on the matter.Life is more of a mystery than most people living in today's materialistic society are capable of realising. This DVD, if nothing else, is swimming upstream in that respect.

$review_text.: Being an ardent M.B


Fan for almost 20 years I was excited when I learned about this release

Disc one is an excellent documentary of the band with interviews of members including "Mike Pinder" and "Denny Laine" and I was very impressed with disc one


However when it came to disc two , the package said it would contain rare archive footage


B.S.! All disc two had was a crappy video of "Go Now" and the rest were video's from the 80's which have been released countless times on various dvd's


( There is an excellent , but rare dvd entitiled "Nights in white satin" , which has the early footage of the classic lineup.) As for disc three it was ok if want old recordings , but aside from Justin Hayward's "London is behind me", I could have done without the disc
However if you Love M.B.,than I do think it is worth getting


I even plan on purchasing the Classic artist dvd release on "Yes" this Jan, And Hope that Classic Artist will hopefully be able to make a release on "Fleetwood Mac" and "Deep Purple".

$review_text.: Willow is an eighties classic I remember from my days in elementary school. It's the perfect adventure fantasy that paved the way for movies like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. Before Willow people hardly stepped into the fantasy realm on screen. It was hard to accomplish but you get no let downs from Ron Howard and George Lucas.  The DVD is amazing. It has every ounce of information you ever wanted to know about Willow. Warwick Davis' commentary is superb and he made me believe it was 1988 again and I was still in elementary school. Now that I am grown I still love Willow and I hope a new generation of children will continue to see it for the gem its worth. This is perfect family entertainment. Skip the VHS version because you are missing a lot. This DVD is one of the best DVD releases. Usually when a DVD claims " Special Edition " you get a snotty little photo gallery and boring director's commentary with nothing to show for it. The Willow DVD proves that just because a film is old doesn't mean its stale.  I recommend this DVD highly! Warwick Davis' commentary is the best I've heard on any DVD. I wished Val Kilmer could have joined Warwick but... Warwick does a great job at bringing you behind the scenes of the film and capturing the time it was made.  You'll love it!By the way, does anyone remember the cute little Willow cards they gave out in cereal boxes back in 1988? What a great movie experience!

$REVIEW.: Prison Break is/was a great TV show and if you have not seen it, then you should
This is one of the best TV shows to air on TV

Great cast, everyone can act

I will not spoil it in any way by talking about the plot (do they ever get out etc.), i advise you buy it and watch it, the production values are extremely high with Hollywood people like Director/Producer Brett Ratner (Rush Hour / X-Men: The Last Stand).Crystal clear Blu Ray, on a large LED TV it looks impeccable.Sadly though, this box-set, is not well priced.Try this one instead, it is from France, but it is Region Free and it default to English for both Audio and menus.Prison Break Complete Blu-ray Collection incl Final Break-23 Discs [French Import, Region Free]The Show is 5 Stars, the price on this box set is not great so i gave it a 3 star, i would never give it a 1 star, that might scare someone away from great TV/Blu Ray watching.I hope i saved you some hard earned money.

$review_text.: For the record, my husband would give this movie 4 stars

 I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on 3 just because (like many other reviewers) I wasn't crazy about the ending
 However, I enjoyed the movie and I am not at all sorry I bought it

 For the record, I am not a comic book fan and I did not really know the backstory to the Captain America story - and I had no trouble following the plot, as some others said they did
 The acting wasn't exactly A+, but I didn't think it was THAT bad

 I enjoyed the story, and I in particular liked the villain

 In reality, it was a gift for my husband and he loved it, so I was satisfied with that
 I myself also enjoyed it; I am sure I will watch it again
 As I said, I was not crazy about the ending; I take it that they were trying to set up a follow up movie, but it felt a bit awkward and disjointed from the rest of the film
 I feel they either should have gone a bit farther with it or left it out entirely


 I recommend.

$review_text.: In the 60's and 70's it was quite fashionable for Brits to travel to North Africa for 'recreation' as well as, less frequently, serious spiritual insights, particulary those related to Sufism.  Here, rather than Pats & Eddie passed out for three days in Morocco, you have a young woman in search of the meaning of life with her two children and a shoestring budget.  This story is based on a true account written by Signmund Freud's grand-daughter, I believe. Kate Winslet and her daughters are burnished by their journey of hardship and shared with kindly in a way that Westerners will find fascinating if hard to understand.  The Koran demands charity especially to the traveller, from the believers.  The self sacrifice of the Moroccan man is typical of the kindness that takes so many Western people who are exposed to it aback.  We in the West are sometimes raised with talk of money as though we were worth less than it.  An Arabic view is quite different and a well spring of relief for a thirsty human being in need of true generosity and love.

$review_text.: First of all ,it is worth taking the time to get the sequence sorted out.Lonesome Dove, was the first written in 1985 ,and took place in the the 1860's when Woodrow was at the height of his career.It was the followed with a sequel in 1993,and took place in the 1890's and when Woodrow was in the twlight of his career.Then Dead Man's Walk was published in 1995,as a prequel to Lonesome Dove and took place in the 1840's when Woodrow was about 20 and in his early days as a Texas Ranger.The main story is about an adventure ,a few years after the Alamo,when a force of about 100 leave Austin Texas,heading to Santa Fe ,to take this area from Mexico.What we see is McMurtry at his best with great storytelling,amazing characrer developments,with and brutal action with all sorts of opposition along the way.The story is packed with action and one suspensful and surprising event  following the last

Typically,when McMurtry gives us an epic,he starts off with a lot of people and characters of every description;and we witness the crowd being whittled down one by one in one gruesome scene after another.In the end, there are vew standing.Gus and Woodrow survive and become the main characters in the other novels.This novel had a great storyline,but not the high profile actors  we see in the others.The scenes and photography are outstanding and you get a good picture what it was like in the 1840's when the west was being wrestled from the Comanches, Apaches and Mexicans in Texas , Mexico and New Mexico.Personally, I prefer the movie versions these novels to reading the books,which I have also done


However;there is so much packed into the 4 hours of this movie ;it needs to be watched more than once.

The premise at first sound absurd and you might find yourself wondering if it will go in another direction, but it is a sweet movie appropriate for the entire family.  You end up feeling that this simple little movie could be based on a real story.  The message, I believe, is that sometimes people have work through their issues in their own unique way and in their own time and that the most effective way to help is to lovingly accept and embrace people as they are.

$REVIEW.: Each night I turned on the HBO feature anxious to see a good dramatic series, and learn about my country's struggle for life through one its most underrated founding fathers, John Adams.Paul Giamatti's performance in the title role is much in dispute as he, like many other actors, seems to play himself as much as his character. He turns from a loving father to the lawyer and representative who sometimes looks apoplectic rather than just an angry or fiery patriot. Much to his credit, I felt the John Adams of later years on subsequent episodes was extremely well-acted.Abigail Adams is played by Laura Linney, and her performance is superb and not the least in dispute. From the first moment, she is thoroughly credible as the vivacious lover, friend, confidante, advisor, and wife of John Adams. Her acting here should garner her an Emmy. The actors protraying Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson turned in stellar performances.Many complain that this did not follow the book of the same title, and  was not true to history exactly. To the first query the answer is what does? To the second, it is a well-written and well-acted drama that deserves our attention.The series begins with the Boston Massacre and John Adams representing the British soldiers. With his successful defense, he is noticed by the Crown, as well as the colonials who are striving for independence. Both want his services. Adams chooses independence over the king and we see him as representative, foreign minister, beggar and borrower, ambassador, vice president, and president. His one anchor through these assignments and occupations in the struggle of a new nation is his love and respect for his wife, Abigail whom he always refers to as "my friend." The letters between the two is one constant that sustains their love through loneliness of separation, as Mr. Adams is more often away than home.Particularly touching is the drab existence they share in an uncompleted White House, the grief John Adams suffers from the loss of his Abigail, his renewed friendship with Thomas Jefferson, and his dying belief that his friend survives him, even though Jefferson died three hours earlier. In one of the ironies of our history, both men died exactly fifty years to the day, after July 4, 1776.This story ends with both Abigail and John Adams quoting letters of their love for each other and a young nation, as they ascend a hill together and look out over their country.

$review_text.: This story is compelling on many levels.  For me, personally, I was living in Fremont, CA at the time of this story's setting.  I spent time in Fremont's Lake Elizabeth park (not the one used in the film) watching the Afghani's [sp] fly their kites.  My children went to the school that abutted the street where he and his father are said to live.  In short they lived within the same community where I lived, and I had NO IDEA of who these people were - what their reasons were for moving into such a suburban setting that was obviously unfamiliar to them - why they did not assimilate into the general culture - any so many more things that this movie makes so poignantly clear.  The story is moving in and of itself - but the honor and tragedy of these people shames me for my indifference.

$review_text.: I have not seen the 1973 original film, `The Day of the Jackal', despite the fact that it has been on my DVR for the better part of the past four years, so maybe that is why I can look back on `The Jackal' with the fondest of memories

 Besides, the 90's were a confusing time for me and my complete obsession with Bruce Willis only added to that confusion, and so I kind of salivated over anything I could get my hands on boasting his star power.This action thriller is labeled unrealistic by some and balked at for being farfetched in its construction, but some premises or genres or films in general are just made to be taken with a grain of salt, so I don't see how you can necessarily fault it for being what it is
 I know that sounds ridiculously hypocritical coming from someone like me, who has openly thrashed other films for not reaching for greatness or just being plain stupid in conception, but I said I was approaching this in bias (in not so many words) so forgive me that

 The acting is very well done, especially from Willis who is utterly chilling as the title character, and the pacing is extraordinary, giving you a true adrenaline rush of sorts


 Yes, there are a lot of plot points that seem placed there to elicit wide eyes and wonderment and not necessarily to make sense, but in the scope of the film it really doesn't matter much since the cast sells everything.So, if you are in the mood for an exciting thrill ride with a memorable villain, this is your ticket


 Just, don't expect it to be the smartest thriller you've ever seen.

$REVIEW.: I watch a lot of movies. I admit that I am a total sucker for sappy romances like French Kiss, When Harry Met Sally, etc. It's been a long time since I've seen a romantic comedy that made me (and my husband!) laugh out loud, sit through without a break, and even shed a little tear at the happy conclusion (what's wrong with a happy ending, anyway? With the world in such a mess, a happy ending is a lovely escape). This movie is a going to be a classic chick flick romance that even the guys will like. Drew Barrymore is wonderful, Hugh Grant is funny, his deprecating humor perfectly timed, and is surprisingly quite musically talented, and the supporting cast is excellent. I always watch with an eye for editing - too much and the movie is choppy. Too little and you take breaks. Music and Lyrics is perfect in all aspects. Comic timing, acting, directing, editing with a story that will leave you feeling good about the world. It's been a long time since there has been such a perfect, sort of old-fashioned, escape movie. And it's about time.

Was I surprised at how great it was so I am going to purchase one for myself.The story has been told by others., so I will only comment on the film. It didn't have big name actors so had to depend on the  story line, acting and views to get across the story. This is a good clean family romantic movie for all but the hardest heart. I had a enjoyable evening with a chocked up throat and a few tears and a very good feeling at the end. When I have had a bad day, I'll pull it out and watch it to boost my moral. Do like I did, rent it first and if you don't want to buy one, I'll be greatly surprised. Too bad there isn't more movies like this one.

$review_text.: After watching the first 30 minutes of this film, I thought it was going to be a simple, elegant story of self-discovery and unrequited love. In many ways it was this, but it delivers a rather unexpected surprise in the process. It could be argued that the movie gets thrown off track a bit after these surprising events unfold, but that's exactly how it is in life, so I didn't mind. If you enjoy story lines that are obvious and include numerous explosions and gun battles, this is definitely not the movie for you. If, however, you like more subtle explorations of human psychology, then I recommend this film.

$review_text.: I got some laughs and decent feedback from customers as IKOAFS screened this week but the Blu quality is what most people were noticing on the display. Universal put together one of their normally packed BDs with solid specs to back it up.I did not watch this to be a documentary or fair representation of the institutional psychiatric field, so I got some fair entertainment and time well-spent out of this (lots of complaining out there). The picture quality is outstanding with all of the shortcomings of certain faces shining through a bit too much. The art-imposed-on-the-screen montages came through a little bit better than the big screen, with that sunset on top of the hospital scene looking deliberately fake (in other words the special effects are not BD worthy but they still looked fine). The DTS really only gets tested in the concert scene and the music piece at the end, actually any of those dream/neo-reality/art sequences use the outer channels some. The special features:* Deleted scenes, 8:45 minutes. Lengthy at times with only a couple of Galifianakis clips having hit the floor. Really worthy for the Gilchrist fans.* Outtakes, 11:28 minutes. Also feels lengthy but a few of the expected ZG jokes and ad-libs make it worth your while. They bleeped out the foul language - lame.* A Look Inside, 3:11 minutes. A clip heavy ad-plug piece with some talking heads gushing storyline and support, skipper.* Premiere at NYC, 2:30 minutes. Some red carpet interviews centering on ZGs talent and Ryan Fleck giving some quick background.* pocket BLU app with the iPad enhancement now. Found nothing new on the BD live section.A worthy renter for those wanting a decent character coming-of-age piece, and maybe a buyer for fans of ZG looking to see him deliver a talented dark performance. 3.5 for the film, 1.5 for the BD specs and features.

$REVIEW.: I found this to be an incredibly interesting film, with fabulous acting in every role and a well deserved Oscar-winning performance from Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher. But were Thatcher herself and her 20 years on the world stage well served by it? Regardless of what we may think of her and her politics, this was the woman who became the first and--so far--only member of her sex to attain the rank of British Prime Minister, the woman who closed Britain's coal mines and fought that war in the Falklands. Would any filmmaker have dared portray such a once-powerful and still-living person through the prism of old-age dementia if that person were male? Just asking. But as I watched I couldn't help wondering.Jim Broadbent is marvelous in the role of Denis Thatcher. Since the real Denis went out of his way to stay in the background and is no longer among the living, no one, including Broadbent, knows how close, if at all, his version matches the original. The pair of young actors in the roles of young Margaret and young Denis are entirely believable as younger versions of Streep & Broadbent. The powerful all-male power broker roles were powerfully well played by actors whose names may escape you but whose faces you know well...possibly from Masterpiece Theater.How about this for a double feature:  Pair "The Iron Lady"  with "Brassed Off," the Pete Posthelwaite/Ewan McGregor movie about the impact of Thatcher's coal mine closures on a mining town, its miners and their marvelous brass band.
$SUMMARY.: I'm far from a Thatcher fan. Never was, never will be, but...

$review_text.: 1951's "On The Riviera" is a classy affair for the talented Danny Kaye, albeit, a slightly more somber one


Filmed twice before (with Maurice Chevalier and Don Ameche in the lead), Kaye does a fine job as a nightclub entertainer who bares a strong resemblance to a dashing French aviator (also Kaye, of course), and is eventually tapped to impersonate him for an important function

This gives the entertainer the chance to get to know the cavalier aviator's rather neglected wife (Gene Tierney).As usual, there are some pleasing musical moments from Kaye (his wife Sylvia Fine composed once again)


However, being more sophisticated & subtle, Kaye has to play it semi-serious, so this one might not appeal to all viewers, although it's still an extremely pleasant film.The DVD transfer preserves the movie's splashy scenery, filled with plenty of lush "eye candy" Riviera shots
But seeing how this film's been out of circulation for a long time, it's worth adding to your Kaye collection!

$review_text.: Philip Marlowe's been around
You see, he's a private detective, so he pretty well knows the score


But you can't always be choosy about your clients, even when they live on the right side of the tracks

After receiving a referral from an acquaintance at the DA's office, Philip (Humphrey Bogart) goes to the home of the wealthy Sternwoods

The General is an elderly infirm man with a stoically discreet butler, and two daughters who were born later in life and who lead him a merry chase


Carmen (Martha Vickers) is wild and flirtatious, and Vivian (Lauren Bacall) is commanding and self-assured

Marlowe discovers how wild Carmen is when she playfully attempts to seduce him in the foyer.The General likes to spend his time in the hothouse where he grows orchids--not because he likes flowers, but the warmth feels good
He's received a threat of blackmail in the mail and he wants Marlowe to look into it


Some guy named Geiger, holding some gambling notes allegedly signed by Carmen
Marlowe agrees to look into it, but as he is leaving, the butler informs him that Mrs
Rutledge (Vivian) wishes to see him


She is curious about why Marlowe is there, but he isn't exactly forthcoming with details, seeing as she's not his client
And why is she concerned about a guy named Regan?It turns out Geiger has a bookstore, so Marlowe does a little homework at the library
He then dons a foppish disguise and makes some inquiries as to certain first editions of the girl who mans the store


Her lack of basic knowledge raises his suspicions, along with the entrance of a guy with a suspicious package in a plain wrapper that she buzzes into the backroom

He tries to talk to the owner, Geiger, but he's not available.Going across the street to a rival bookstore, Marlowe charms a description of Geiger out of the more knowledgeable girl there (look for a young Dorothy Malone here0, and afterward settles down to wait


When a man matching that description exits the shop, with his driver, Philip follows them and again watches and waits
During the evening, he sees a flash, hears two shots, and as he approaches the house, he sees two cars flee the scene


Inside he discovers a rather stoned Carmen Sternwood, and a rather dead Arthur Geiger.Marlowe returns Carmen to the bosom of her family, and then returns to the scene of the crime to discover that the corpse is gone
He notifies the police, while still pursuing his own investigation, which leads to, among other places, a high stakes gambling joint, and low class hoods


Marlowe has to figure out what's what and who's who, and hopefully not lose his life in the process.Just before watching The Big Sleep, I read the novel by Raymond Chandler, so I was probably pre-disposed to catch discrepancies


Some made sense to me, some not so much
For example, in the book Vivian Sternwood is Mrs
Rusty Regan, but that was changed and I don't know why, because it changes the General's interest in Regan and his whereabouts


In the book, Marlowe finds Carmen in Geiger's house, stark naked and sitting on a throne, but I realize that would never have flown back then
Same for when she talks her way into Marlowe's apartment and is waiting naked in his bed
Censors would have had a cow, I'm sure.Other than that, it's fairly faithful to the book

Well, excluding the part where you never do find out the significance of the book/books and the list (Geiger has a lending library of pornography, and the coded list is of his clients)
Also, the man who avenged Geiger's death, without giving away any movie spoilers, is Geiger's lover, so that was totally glossed over.Bogart is magnificent as Marlowe, I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role

Martha Vickers is competent as Carmen, but I didn't see Lauren Bacall as Vivian


In fact, I think she'd have made a better Carmen, but it's a no-brainer why that casting occurred, since she and Bogie were either married at that point, or at least together
In fact, a romantic aspect was added that didn't really exist in the book, basically because of that

To me, that's on a par with something they did in the film Evita, where a song that didn't even belong to Evita was taken from another character and given to her, basically because Madonna played her.Other than all that, though, it's a very enjoyable film, well written and well directed and pretty well acted

True film noir and a classic

I don't think anyone but Bogie could have carried it off that well, though


A definite keeper for your collection, worth revisiting on a regular basis
And don't forget to look for Elisha Cook Jr


doing what he does best in a secondary role.

$review_text.: When I first saw this show a couple of years ago I thought Ricky & Stephen were just being mean to Karl.  Then as I watched more I became hooked.  The animation works brilliantly as they illustrate scenes and ideas that are being discussed.  I believe that Karl is genuine - no one could make him up, he's too perfect - but I think also it's easy to overlook that he's not an idiot, he's not stupid, he just has some odd views of things.  He also makes some very funny comments that are just brilliant, but his sense of humor seems to dry that he never laughs.All three seasons of this show are brilliant.  It's so funny and there are times I've cried I've laughed so hard.  But it's not for everyone.  If the idea of listening to three guys talk for half an hour doesn't appeal to you, then it might not be for you.

$review_text.: I'd give this documentary five stars except for the poor quality of the soundtrack (the music is obnoxious and drowns out the commentators and the narrator - there are no subtitles).This documentary is very, very well-written.  It covers many of the moral, political and military issues of the time.  The re-creation of the battle scenes is some of the best that I've viewed.  The re-creations give you a real sense of the hardships and tragedies endured by the troops.The documentary seems to be fair and balanced, exploring the views and beliefs of both sides in the conflict (North and South).  The well-written narration illuminates many of the historical forces that shaped the world-shaking conflict.  For example, much of the brutality visited by the North on the South, at the end of the War, arose simply because everyone was despondent over the War and wanted it to end.  As the CSA still had over 150,000 troops in the field at the time of Appomattox (Lee's surrender), the War could have continued indefinitely.The documentary accurately points out the terrible attrition on both sides of the conflict (over 500,000 died on both sides) and the drastic efforts of leaders, on both sides, to try to end the conflict by decisive battles.There is a balanced, and erudite exploration of the moral and legal issues of slavery in the South.  There is also a very-well written episode on the efforts to reconstruct the South after the War, and, the political battles fought over the issue of whether to punish the South for the insurrection.In all, this is one of the best documentaries I've viewed on the Civil War.This makes an excellent background for understanding the political events which are the focus of Steven Spielberg's recent film: Lincoln

Like most U.S. Amazon customers, I do not speak French. This disk has English subtitles, but I can't read subtitles and watch the picture at the same time. Many European movies have multiple language sound tracks, but the Product Description for this one indicates only French.All the reviews presented here are for the 2003 DVD release, and are fine for that movie. I own it, and am very happy with it. But unless you understand French, or have no problem with subtitles, you probably won't be happy with this one. Amazon should have taken greater pains to ensure that customers know about the French only sound track before deciding to purchase this movie.

$review_text.: Right off the bat, I just want to comment that Band of Brothers is the best dramatic interpretation of World War II events that I have ever seen (think "Saving Private Ryan", but for ten entire episodes).  The basic premise of the show is following the 101st Airborne Regiment (a section of the 506th Parachute Regiment) from its entrance into the war ("basic" training) to events such as D-Day, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and eventually capturing Hitler's famed "Eagle's Nest" hideout and symbolically ending the European campaign.  There are two main reasons why I believe this cinematic masterpiece is the best of all-time:First, is the realism of the war-action scenes.  Whether it was the visual spectacle of hundreds of paratroopers floating down into France on D-Day, the intense street-to-street fighting that was often needed to capture certain landmarks, or the trees exploding from German shells in the woods nearby Bastogne as American soldiers dived for cover, the sheer scope of the cinematography is remarkable and will leave you feeling as if you have the slightest comprehension of what being there "in the flesh" must have been like.  I remember when "Saving Private Ryan" was released and many film-goers commented on how realistic the D-Day action was...well, Band of Brothers sustains that realism throughout multiple war events.  A sight to behold, at the very least.However, what really makes Band of Brothers special is its dramatic focus on the men of Easy Company (the 101st).  The show starts right from the beginning, with the men receiving the toughest training the army has to offer.  Grueling runs up and down the infamous "Curahee" mountain effectively weeded out the best of the best and essentially shaped Easy Co. into perhaps the finest fighting force in the entire U.S. Service.  The bond that those men achieved during that training carries over into their combat experience (starting with their drop behind enemy lines on D-Day), and makes for a very personal dramatic experience, as each man really did think of the guy next to him as a brother of sorts.  What really impressed me, though, was how each episode seemed to focus on a different dramatic angle to the story.  A few that stand out in my mind are...-How Easy Co. handles the incompetence (leading to lives being needlessly lost in one case) of not one but two different commanders throughout the war.-The internal struggle of Frank Winters, who initially leads Easy Co. but eventually moves up in rank.  Though he is honored by the promotion, he also is a bit uncomfortable in what he perceives as "leaving" his men in the heat of war.-The devastation that was wreaked in the forests surrounding Bastogne, where more American soldiers (without proper winter clothing) died because of sickness and "trenchfoot" (essentially a completely frozen foot) than due to enemy shelling.  Perhaps the saddest moment of the series comes when one Lt. sees his two best friends get their legs blown off trying to help others find cover.  The Lt. suffers a nervous breakdown and is never quite the same afterwards.-The level of shock in the hearts and minds of Easy Co. when they stumble across their first concentration camp and liberate it.Overall, Band of Brothers will both shock you with the intensity of its war scenes and make you think long and hard about the heavy toll that warfare takes on the human soul.  A special treat comes at the tail end of the series, when actually living veterans of Easy Co. appear on camera and tell their experiences firsthand.For anyone even remotely interested in war drama, this series will blow you away.  Also, if I were an instructor teaching the effects of WWII, I can guarantee that I would use multiple clips from this series.

$review_text.: Having an interest in Australian history, as well as teaching the subject to middle school students, the battle(s) on the Kokoda trail in Papua New Guinea between Australian forces and the invading Japanese, is a WW2 event that causes a sparkle to shine forth from the eyes of the students.Out numbered and out gunned, these Australian soldiers fought bravely under the worst of tropical conditions: rain, mud, jungle, malaria, and extreme heat. What makes this event memorable was the courage of a few men fighting against impossible odds and holding their position against a fierce adversary.Although slowing the Japanese invasion, in the end it was the harsh environmental conditions and a lack of supplies that prevented the invasions success. The 6000 Japanese soldiers, for the most part, died of starvation and disease. War is never a handsome affair, and the Australian film Kokoda depicts the conditions and extreme hardships with poignant reality...other than that, however, the film was a big disappointment.The impression is the director focused on portraying, as realistically as possible, the dire conditions of war. He accomplished this aim without question. However, Kokoda has no `plot' per say, there is no actual story in this film other than focusing on a small contingent of soldiers in retreat, their deaths and suffering, and the courage these men had in order to carry on despite the apparent uselessness of it all.As many people have commented after seeing this film, it begins compellingly, but we continue to watch expecting `something' to happen, a flashback of home from one of the soldiers, a character development or relationship explored to ensure we feel the pathos when one dies in battle; at least a `story' amongst the harsh conditions of war because there is only so much shooting and killing and audience can take.Kokoda is like an expensive documentary with great actors, well made, with no story other than the brief contextual explanation from a voice over at the beginning and a paragraph of information at the end. In fact, the film did not teach the audience anything about this important historical event in Australian history; guessing that the director expected `us' to know enough to feel the harshness of war and how close the invading force came to success.To be fair, this film is a good visual of history to convey what these courageous boy's experienced defending the country. My impression is that the director had tunnel vision, making the film to a small "Australian informed audience", because any audience overseas would wonder what the film was all about.In the end, my students gained a better visceral understanding of a part of history they should be proud of, that war is a reality and nothing to be glorified because war is pure hell. And their grandfathers and great grandfathers' fought bravely to defend our country against a ferocious enemy.A 2.5 rating at best.

$REVIEW.: The movie version of Graham Greene'sOur Man in Havana (Penguin Classics)is well worth a watch - if you can find it in the US

Hmm, a movie about Cold War paranoia that cannot be purchased in the US? Perhaps the spooks at the CIA really do have a sense of humor.Alec Guinness stars as Jim Wormold in this comedic spy thriller
Wormold is a vacuum salesman in Havana with a daughter with expensive tastes
He becomes the unlikely head of a British spy ring and is handsomely rewarded by MI-6


Only one problem: the spy ring is fake


Make that two problems: He is so successful, the Brits send out a couple helpers

No, wait more problems

Although the spy ring is fake, the names Wormold provides are of real live people in Havana


The bad guys get wind of the spy ring and for all they know, these are real spies


The movie combines humor with action.The movie was filmed on location in Havana very shortly after the revolution removed the dictator Batista from power
Nearly a half-century later, it remains the last US movie shot in Cuba
In addition to Guinness, the movie also features Burl Ives, Ralph Richardson, Noel Coward, Maureen O'Hara, and Ernie Kovacs

Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: This is a great family film.  It was good, but would have got 5 stars instead of 4 if Steve Guttenberg was in it.  But it was still funny.  Also, Bobcat Goldwaith stopped at this point too, but the rest of the goofy cast is still here.  Larvell Jones, Eugine Tackleberry, Moses Hightower, Hooks (I forget her last name), Debbie Callahan, Thaddues Harris, Procter, Tommy Cronklin/House, Nick Lassard, Kate (I forget her last nametoo) and who could forget jolly Eric Lassard.  In this fourth sequel in the funny series, the academy goes to Miami Beach to celebrate Lassard's retirment.  But criminals, kidnap Lassard, his force tried to save him.  While, so it seems, that Nick Lassard took over the place of Mahoney.  Alot of people like Nick better than Mahoney, but I would have to disagree, Mahoney was better.  The criminals in this film are goofy and hopeless.  And finally, after all the wait, the whole series is finally available on dvd.  They will be seprate and in a box set.  You should get the box set.  It will be coming out on April 6.  The first film will have a great commentary, but the rest of the films will just have a trailer and a making of reel.  So, a great film, a great series.  Mark your calender for April 6 because, Police Academy is coming to dvd.  Oh ya, I have a dvd review of the Police Academy box set, and I think you will find it useful.

$REVIEW.: This is a documentary that presents, in a very stylish way reminiscent of golden era MGM productions, the history of the studios through it's movies and personalities both on and off the camera.  The production itself is almost too distracting.Despite the 6 hour running time, viewers should be aware that they are going to get as much about the office politics as about the movies that were made.  As a consequence, all of their favorite films may not get covered to the degree that they would like.  This is more about the overall business of making movies, rather than in depth reporting on the technique of any particular film or artist.We also do not get the early history of Metro Pictures, nor of Sam Goldwyn Studios, that were merged by Loew's under Louis Mayer in 1924.  The storyline ends with the acquisition by Ted Turner of a company burdened with so much debt that he kept the film library, sold back the name, and turned over the studio facilities that were left to Lorimar Tele-Pictures.  (This documentary was produced by Turner Entertainment.)This is still rewarding to get through, though you might want to watch over several nights.

$REVIEW.: First let me say this, plain, simple, racism is wrong

 Racism is more than just wrong though, it is pure evil
 One should never judge another by the colour of the skin
 One should never make presumptions toward another by the race of that person
 Yes this film could be said to have stereotypical blacks AND whites, but this film is not racism per say
 Simplistic yes, but then again, this is a children's movie, not something you'd see as drama on cable tv
 Unlike most films of today, this film is truly suited for parents and their children


 The stories are important because they have life lessons that any body...no matter how young or old...can learn with a smile and a nod to the head toward wisdom

 Children can laugh out loud with their folks at the humor of rabbit, fox, and bear
 Song of the South is a well developed movie that might yes be showing a simpler time, but at least it shows something descent for those watching...unlike the two examples I am about to give toward what true racism is...Yes still so many people cry the racism card toward this movie


 I am a firm believer that racism is wicked, but those people calling this movie racism seem to be quite quiet in terms of what is seen in this day and age

 I am about to give two examples of what racism is, in comparison to the Song of the South
Example 1:  I turned on the comedy network the other day, during the day time, during hours that children can easily watch, and there were African American comedians laughing and snickering because they call each other the "N" word
 As if the "N" word was a joke?  I would like to remind those who use that word so frivolously of the painting by Norman Rockwell of the young African American girl in a white dress being brought to school
 If you know the picture, you know what I mean


 I doubt very seriously she'd say yes if you asked that girl if the "N" word was "funny."  Example 2:  Grand Theft Auto SA, the latest game in that PS2 series


 This game is not only violent and destructive, it gives a thumbs up toward the life of a gangster--killing other African Americans because they are in other gangs, killing police men (especially white) just because the character's can kill the police, drugs, prostitution, etc


etc.These two examples are far greater and more important examples of what racism is, and the destructive nature of racism...Songs of the South, on the other hand, is not
 I think that if Disney had any sense in their mind they would put this movie out because this movie is a great movie for all to see.

$review_text.: DI Tom Thorne is the hero of Mark Billingham's cop novel series from London, the stereotypical dark big city loner with the hunches (as his squad rival says: why don't you try it the conventional way and search for clues and proof?) and with the problems in team work


His cases are nut cases and serial evil, and he adds to the darkness by his own behavior.Sleepyhead was the first novel in the series and it is the first that has been turned into a TV mini series of 3 parts
We have a serial killer with medical knowledge
His victims seem to have died from heart attacks and are nearly mistaken for natural death cases


Then one victim survives, but is paralyzed

She learns to communicate by use of her eyes
She becomes a valuable witness.This could be a very good straightforward thriller, a flirt between the DI and the treating medical doctor thrown into the bargain
That plus the cop squad rivalries would have filled a normal 90 minutes film, but for a mini-series of 3x 50 minutes, the story needs to be upgraded or stretched


What we get are flashbacks into a past case, involving a dark secret that the DI shares with the gay coroner


The new case is inexplicably linked to the old one


We have a suspenseful plot with some holes and numerous clich&eacute;s


 I would have rated the film 3 stars but for the following.SPOILER: The ethical issues involved in the story are treated in a far too cavalier fashion for my taste


We are finding ourselves, literally, in the situation that we hope the DI gets away with murder


We also follow the thought process of the paralyzed victim of the killer and we agree with her that this is not the life for a formerly active young woman

We watch the doctor turn off the machinery upon the young woman's blinked instructions (like Clint Eastwood with his girl boxer)

Is it as easy as that in London?The second miniseries on this DVD is case number two, Scaredy Cat
This is a rather violent case with two killers who commit serial crimes in a synchronized fashion


The police find one of the two killers fairly quickly

They find out that he is scared of his partner and asks for protection

Thorne decides to let him free and use him as bait (again, ethics!)
Things go wrong, of course.All in all an interesting but questionable approach to modern city life.

$review_text.: The sets are wonderful. The characters are so fine (as in wonderful). I guess, as in most things, I like the characters most, but oh, what an opulent set.This is so much better than Downton Abbey. So much. Downton is getting ridiculous with its 21st century mores in early 20th century settings. I love 21st century mores, but not when set in inappropriate times. I usually love period pieces, and I will watch Downton, but I do dislike that aspect. It makes it unbelievable. There are wonderful sets there, too.In Selfridge's first season, there was probably more to do with the real history of Selfridge's than this season. So that season was even better, but this one is very good. In this one, we have more of the made up stories and characters. I'm sure. That probably makes it vary into the wrong century somewhat also, but not nearly as badly as Downton Abbey.In this season, we get to see more of Miss Mardle and Kitty Hawkins. Both great characters. I think I like Miss Mardle the most. Kitty is more coy and has more feminine &#34;wiles,&#34; but she is a strong character, too. Miss Mardle is a middle-aged woman, head of a department. She gave up her child-bearing years to love and wait for a married man whose wife was ill. When the wife dies, he drops Miss Mardle for a younger woman supposedly because he wants to leave a legacy (children). Miss Mardle's strength in moving past that while still having to work with the man is admirable. Suprisingly, I didn't recognize the actress as Watson's wife in the new Sherlock series with Cumberbatch.I also love Lady Mae Loxley, but that's another story. I highly recommend this series if you like period pieces.

$REVIEW.: 1948 was an Oscar duel between the British import "Hamlet" by Laurence Olivier (with six nominations) and the American production of "The Treasure of Sierra Madre" by John Huston (with four Oscar bids). Both dramatic pictures were B/W and were heavy favorites to dominate the awards (and did so with seven wins between them).John Huston deservedly won best director and best screenplay (with the joke that William Shakespeare wasn't eligible for "Hamlet" that year). The film is a dark one that explores the themes of greed and madness with superb all-around performances, especially by Walter Huston and Humphrey Bogart. By directing his father, a veteran character actor of stage and screen, to the best suporting actor prize, John Huston made Oscar history -- it mark the first time that a father and son won Oscars in the same year for the same film.Inexplicably, Mr. Bogart was not even nominated for best actor in what arguably was his finest performance of his long career -- this oversight would contribute to his win three years later in another John Huston production of "The African Queen." He is mesmerizing as the American who literally and ever so slowly goes insane over his pot of gold.At the end of the 1948 Oscar awards, "Hamlet" and "The Treasure Of Sierra Madre" were tied with three Oscars each -- "Hamlet" would  break the tie by winning best picture and giving Mr Olivier his second Oscar win of the evening (to go with his best actor win). Similiar in themes, both films are worth seeing and  the viewer can decide which they prefer more.

$review_text.: Better sight gags, more inspired comic sequences, and an actually clever mystery plot make "The Pink Panther 2" a more confident and more enjoyable film than its predecessor, which itself was perfectly watchable.Yes, I guess it's pretty clear that I'm one of those in the minority who don't think it's sacrilege that Steve Martin is trying to follow in the footsteps of the great Peter Sellers.  Two things should be remembered on this score:  Peter Sellers was extremely talented, no doubt, but his Inspector Clouseau was, well... a bumbling detective character.  In other words, it's not the kind of subtle, nuanced character that another talented comic actor can't legitimately take a crack at.  Secondly, people forget that critics weren't head over heels in love with the original Sellers Clouseau movies, either, especially his last two or three.  Moviegoers tended to like them, but critics mostly dismissed them in favor of Seller's more serious comic works, like "Dr. Strangelove", "Being There", etc.  So let's all get a grip now.Myself, I enjoy Martin's take on the character.  Seller's Clouseau was a complete boob who only solved crimes and attained fame completely accidentally, which was admittedly interesting.  Martin's take is also interesting, though: his Clouseau is a complete boob at most things, but also has some legitimate detective skills.  Those two divergent aspects of the same character makes Martin's Clouseau fun to watch.So, is the film a comic masterpiece?  Nah.  But "The Pink Panther 2" is a lot of fun, and definitely worth a trip to the theater.
$SUMMARY.: Just relax and enjoy this perfectly good comedy

$REVIEW.: I recently watched this for the second time after initially watching it some years ago and was even more impressed the second time around
While the reasons might not interest anyone but me, the fact is, this movie touched me and moved me deeply
For starters, it is a gorgeous film to watch

The seamless integration of live actors into Kahlo's stunning and evocative work is a magical joy to behold and adds even more depth to the artist's brutally candid art
Secondly, Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina deliver top notch performances and most impressive may have been Hayek who is on screen nearly the entire time

I can forgive the vanity hiring of Ashley Judd and Edward Norton as their portrayals are less than the aforementioned two, but this is a minor issue
Lastly, regarding the dvd features and what-not, the second disc is mostly behind the scenes featurettes on the making of the movie whereas the special features on the first disc have lengthy interviews that are illuminating and candid while demonstrating the love Hayek and Taymor have for Kahlo.I am not a Frida Kahlo scholar by any means nor do I wish to convey any knowledge of her art, life, politics, or anything else
I know that I find her paintings to be vivid and mesmerizing and that's enough for me

I am grateful to this movie for giving me an introduction to an artist whose work I have grown fascinated with and I am furthermore glad that I have a little knowledge, albeit Hollywoodized, of this remarkable human being


My interest has been piqued by this sumptuous love letter to Frida and I will continue to enjoy this movie and my exploration of her work and her life

I hope you find a similar experience.

$review_text.: Season 2 is a string of consistently strong, funny episodes.  There's sophisticated verbal humor, clever pranks and all-around great comedic pace and timing; the actors work wonderfully off each other in scenes that are allowed time to play out.  The show does well with drama too (as seen with the Jim-Pam-Roy triangle), and Season 2 has given all of the characters, even the minor ones, a chance to develop and let their personal quirks and eccentricities shine; compared to Season 1, Season 2 has more of an ensemble feel, even though it still has a core of main characters.The main reason the show is so strong is that it's essentially all about the characters, and the humor is rooted in their personalities.  Dwight Schrute, for instance, is a legendary comedic creation - to call him the strange, authoritarian office geek is not doing him enough justice.  You have to see Rainn Wilson bring him to life, working off the wonderful scripts.  Also, I recommend watching the blooper reel.  It has some hilarious footage of Wilson cracking up while delivering Dwight's lines; he has a really infectious laugh and often laughs to the point of tears.The humor in The Office is fresh, often odd and unexpected, and definitely not politically correct.  It seems like the cast has such a great time making the show; that playfulness comes across.  This is a show that knows what to do with its characters, and knows how to seed drama, romance, and even heartbreak into all of the fun.

Some great costumes and a view in a time long gone by...Gillian Anderson is great as well and I admire her for taking on the rool she played.So if you like period pieces, you will enjoy this one!

$REVIEW.: Having purchased nearly everything Beatle related out there, I can tell you that this is a good DVD, but not great


 Let me put it to you this way, if you have the Anthology DVD set, think of this as the bonus features for it

 Many of the same interviews are duplicated in this DVD from the Anthology but most are extended so you get to see more of the interview that the Anthology cut away from.If you're a Beatles nut, this is excellent


 If you're a casual Beatles fan, this is not for you, the Anthology is


 As for the interviews on this DVD, be aware there aren't that many

 It's not like the an hour of back-to-back interview/news footage


 In fact, most of the DVD is just file footage as a narrator talks to take up some time and space.I give this DVD 4 stars


 It's more like 3 1/2
 If you're a Beatles enthusiast, I would try to rent it first because I don't really believe you'll want to watch this over and over again.

$review_text.: If anything could give a bad name to Caligula -- a boyish emperor whose only sins were to love his sisters too well, to have too ironic a sense of humor, to exercise justice too emphatically and to have too optimistic a view of his future -- it would be this sodden pile of oozing lasagna. I, Claudius it ain't.The cast consists of Malcolm McDowell as Caligula, Peter O'Toole as Tiberius, John Gielgud as Nerva, Helen Mirren as Caesonia and the flopping, furry bits and pieces of a lot of naked Italian extras. It is stunning and amusing to see the likes of Gielgud and Mirren recite their lines with serious intent and then watch a quick cut-away to hardcore fellatio at a Bob Guccione version of an orgy. It has to be said: The orgies are the most boring part of this movie. Guccione cuts in hardcore sex with all the timing of a metronome. Extras do so much genital fingering I'm surprised they didn't come down with carpel tunnel syndrome.Peter O'Toole, as a seriously degenerate Tiberius, has been known to give ripe and awful performances in his career. Here, he outdoes himself. It's not that the man is shameless, it's that he appears embarrassingly to be trying to give a performance. Malcolm McDowell is the only one who seems to be amused at the awful role he agreed to play for what, I hope, was a lot of money. McDowell is a fascinating, sly, humorous and serious actor. Even when he's humping around enjoying both the bride and the groom at a wedding party, or doing a lascivious dance to please Peter O'Toole, or ordering his legions to attack the papyrus, or playing the sneering host at a long, long orgy (with all those close-up cut-aways), I still like him. He carries what acting weight there is in this tank of rancid Penthouse rejects. Guccione, the editor and publisher of Penthouse who produced Caligula (and directed the hardcore parts), seems to have no more an erotic imagination here than he had in his magazine.The movie is so humorless, so hypocritical and so cheesy it not only will put you off Caligula, it probably will put you off genitals.

 It was uplifting to see the transformation of Clifton Powell's character and how even those around him could be impacted by realzing that its not just a game but its real life and death

$REVIEW.: If a movie is going to have the title of Snow White and the Huntsman, perhaps the investors should have invested in a Snow White that can do more than stand on an X and look unsure of herself.The title of the movie should have been "EVIL QUEEN: mein kampf", eh? eh? Sounds better right? Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen was an excellent choice. She is able to garner sympathy and show that at one time she herself was victim to another persons life-altering decision - was that her mother or neighborhood witch that initiated the curse? Honestly, I feel the movie would have been more interesting if it covered the history of the Queen and the numerous (20?) kings she overthrew. I feel that with all the cunning and intelligence that the Evil Queen had, surely, her agenda was greater than that of stealing women and taking their youth. With all the time she spent on earth, surely her persona, wisdom and goals were far greater than that. The manner in which she created a false army to appear as a beautfiul victim to seduce the King indicates how cunning she is. There is so much more with regards to direction that the industry can take with Charlize Theron as the Evil Queen.I once saw on a blog that in one of the earlier centuries, the word "nice" meant foolish or simpleton(?). Kristen Stewart, you look great, and apparently with her as the featured actress in this movie, the audience these days is expecting more than a pretty face who stands on a mark and appears "nice". At least I do. She needs to take acting lessons. What she got away with in Twilight stopped working here in this movie.  Hey, when you're at your jobs, you dont get better by people telling you how great you are and letting things slide. You dont get away on the job with your looks, its not the real world. I just feel as though someone who had more....live theater experience possibly, could have handled the part of Snow White better. Yes, Kristen Stewart is gorgeous and she has that certain something that makes you want to watch her, but sometimes, it just isnt enough.Overall, if you're interested in the Queen and watching Charlize Theron show the underlings what acting is all about, I recommend this movie. The 3 stars are for Charlize, because she carried it that far. Way to go Charlize!

$review_text.: Neither the book, nor the amateur first film mentions it much, and this new film only briefly touches on it, but several of the Kon-Tiki crew were heroes of the first order, not even counting this marvelous expedition


Knut Haugland (the "radio operator") was one of Norway's greatest WWII heroes, leading the fight against the Nazi's and also sabotaging their early work with Atomic energy

 Knut was given a number of Knighthoods and orders
They don't make men like this anymore

Torstein Raaby (the other radio guy) helped sink the Tirpitz and was a noted arctic explorer.Now, the original film is a fantastic feat and won the Academy Award for best Documentary in 1951
Well deserved

But it's all in hand-held B&W;, rather grainy.However, this new film is in glorious color, and the blue of the sea has to be seen and appreciated

This new film has fantastic cinematography , and the actors are (more or less) dead ringers for the real crew members

Using all local actors the Norwegians lent a great deal of verisimilitude to this breathtakingly beautiful film

It was also nominated for a Oscar.Even tho the dangers here are mostly staged, rather than real, the film was shot on the open ocean, and it shows.Just beautiful.

$REVIEW.: Another wonderful DVD from Euroarts!This recording  is of the gala concert to commemorate Mozart's 250th birthday (and not surprisingly it is an all Mozart affair),  beginning with the  Overture to Don Giovanni, followed by the Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra (featuring  Sharon Kam, playing the basset clarinet) and closing with the Symphony No. 38 "Prague".The concert  was recorded at the Estates Theatre in Prague on Jan 27th, 2006.  This is a small, horseshoe shaped theater that has a series of 5 stacked loge boxes surrounding and rising above the main audience floor; to say the decor is opulent would be a gross understatement. The concert is played by the Czech Philharmonic under the skillful baton of Manfred Honeck. Interestingly enough, all three pieces performed at this concert had their first performances at this very same venue in the late 1780's and early 1790's.The city of Prague was very special to Mozart as it was here that his music seemed to be most appreciated by the nobility and the public in general; here he received accolades the he could only dream of in Vienna. Thus it is not surprising that Mozart chose to honor Prague with these first performances; the city and its inhabitants were obviously very special to him.Highlight of the disc:While the Overture and the "Prague" symphony were expertly played with pace, feeling and enthusiasm, it was, Sharon Kam, the  soloist for the clarinet concerto, who provided the highlight of this DVD. Kam is a clarinetist extraordinaire, and she uses a basset clarinet (instead of the usual clarinet in A) for this performance. This is the same type of instrument that was used in the original performance in 1791; it has  a slightly lower  range than the clarinet in A and Kam is able to use her instrument to perfection,  giving the bass notes  a rich,  velvety tone. Simply magnificent to watch as well as hear.The disc is recorded beautifully; featuring great camera angles and superb audio. It was  then professionally edited and transcribed to disc; this DVD is of the highest quality.Negatives?...well, yes one...the audience's response to this concert. What I discovered on this disc were three magnificently performed works (especially the solo by Sharon Kam) and yet the reception by those in attendance that night, might at best, be described as...subdued; a token of almost "ho-hum" appreciation. In other words...polite applause, just long enough to not be considered rude.  From my perspective (the DVD) I saw a performance that was simply stellar; well, I can still offer my own "bravos" and "bravas" from the comfort of my home.Simply a magnificent DVD; anyone who loves  Mozart, or just good classical music will want to have for their collection. 5 Stars...more if I could.

$REVIEW.: One needs to have the proper expectations to enjoy I SELL THE DEAD.  This is not really a horror story.  It's not scary, nor is it really meant to be.  It's an homage to both the horror comics of prior generations, as well as a nod to great horrors movies of the past.  It is a silly, light comedy...the laughs are modest, but the tone is jovial.The movie begins with the execution of one long-time grave robber, and the subsequent interrogation of his younger partner by a priest eager to hear the secrets these grave robbers might have to share.  (The movie is set in some vague 17th - 19th century time, I would guess.) Thus, we are shown a series of little stories, as the grave robber first tells us how he joined the business, then how he mastered it, and at last, how he and his partner began to discover unusual things during their work (such as vampires, zombies and a few other surprises).  Each of these little "short stories" is loosely tied together, and thus the movie feels a little bit like a linear story mixed with a horror anthology.The movie was filmed on a very low budget and the special effects really hearken to a much earlier era.  Fog machines were put to HEAVY use here, primarily to cover the cheesy sets and CGI backgrounds.  The film is made with gusto and the right amount of over-acting.  There is nothing subtle here.  In fact, much of the editing and camera work reminded me of early Sam Raimi, with charging cameras and similar lighting.  Character development is minimal and motivations are always sketchy at best.  No attempt is made to explain why there are vampires, for example...they just are.The star of the film is Dominic Monaghan ("Lost") as the younger grave robber.  He works primarily alongside Larry Fessenden as his mentor.  The two have a fairly easy chemistry, but a lot of their dialogue is repetitive and there are numerous scenes of the two of them at the local pub, discussing plans or upbraiding each other for wrongs.  These scenes feel like padding in an already short (83 minutes) film.  Ron Perlman ("Sons of Anarchy") is the inquisitive priest, and Angus Scrimm from PHANTASM makes a brief appearance.  Otherwise, the cast is unremarkable and fairly amateurish.This movie has a light-hearted, easy-going quality that is quite amiable.  Everyone is having a good time.  There are a few splashes of real humor, such as in the depiction of the zombies.  But the movie is simply TOO easy-going, TOO amateurish and TOO lazily written to be truly enjoyable.  I don't feel I wasted my time, exactly...but I was never deeply involved and even occasionally was checking my watch to see how much was left.  I have no problem with low-budget production values (which the filmmakers did a good job of maximizing), and I can even tolerate mediocre supporting acting...but there is no excuse for lazy writing.  A bit more attention to the work done BEFORE the cameras were even turned on might have turned this from "barely passable on a slow night" to "good, clean, harmless fun."

$review_text.: When IT first came out back in the mid 80s, it was one of my favorite books.  Even with its gargantuan size, King managed to hold my interest and I felt totally immersed in the tiny town of Derry and the seven youngsters who carried the weight of the book on their shoulders.  I first saw the movie adaptation when it aired as a mini-series on TV and although I found it quite good, its "tacky" spider ending and the miscasting of the adults kept it from being the classic I would have liked to see.  Viewing it again now, some fifteen years later, I found it more enjoyable without all the commercial breaks and having to wait a night to see the next episode.  What makes IT such a refreshing horror novel/movie is its focus on friendship, something King captures beautifully, particularly when the characters are kids.  Kids nowadays would never know the joy of forming a secret club, building a dam, or binding together to face the usual bullies of childhood.  The young actors are superb:  the late Jonathan Brandis (he committed suicide in 2003) as Bill; Emily Perkins (Brigitte in the Ginger Snaps series), and Ben Heller as young Ben are especially good.  Unfortunately, when casting the adults, the producers opted to go for familiar TV faces (Richard Thomas, John Ritter, Tim Reid, Harry Anderson) or actors from B-movies (Dennis Christopher of Fade to Black), and these guys just didn't fill the adult shoes as convincingly as I would have liked.  Annette O'Toole (One on One) does do a good job as the adult Beverly, and Olivia Hussey adds some British class in her small role as Thomas' wife.  But Thomas seemed to be an adult version of his John Boy Walton and Anderson, Reid and Ritter overacted shamelessly.  Some of the special effects early on are quite good but the spider at the end is just not menacing or convincing enough, so the movie loses a lot of momentum there.  But IT is still a worthwhile three hours, and I recommend if you haven't read the book, do yourself a favor and read it.  King is superb in the capturing of childhood friendships.

$REVIEW.: After all the great reviews I'd read -- including a particularly persuasive rave in "The New Yorker" -- I was primed to see this horror-comedy about a pollution-bred monster running wild in a Korean sewer system.But despite its smooth look and admirable camerawork, "The Host" is surprisingly uneffective. Aside from the moster's brisk initial attack, the action isn't exciting and the comedy isn't especially funny. In fact, large sections of this film are just boring.I'll take an anti-hero any day of the week, but the family here is so hapless and sad they quickly become maddening.It's great to see a thriller with ambitions beyond the typical PG-13 slasher flicks, or the hard R-rated torture chamber endurance matches, but "The Host" has a long way to go before it's in a league with "Jaws" or "Alien" as some have suggested.Disappointing.

$review_text.: So John Forbes Nash is now (almost) a household name. With good reason... the Nobel prize mathematician's story is a good one. It deserves attention... and director Ron Howard did a wonderful job of creating a masterful piece of Hollywood cinema. Based on Nash's experiences at New Jersey's most famed learning establishment, Princeton University, thru the development of his economic theory ("Nash's Equilibrium"), his marriage to Alicia, and his eventual work at MIT. Imagine if Robert Redford directed and Tom Cruise played the part of Nash as it might have been (they both considered it). I can't see this film being much better... however it would be kind of interesting to see another great director's (and the actor's) take on the same script. Russell Crowe takes the challenge of portraying the man with a chip on both soldiers (in this case schizophrenia), Mr. John Nash, right in stride with his previous preformance as Maximus in "Gladiator". I can't imagine anyone else playing this role of Nash as well as Crowe did. Co-stars Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany and Judd Hirsch round out a wonderful supporting cast. Footnote: Alicia (Connelly) was maybe to evenly tempered in this film thru all of Nash's emotional ups & downs... almost too much so (a performance worthy of an Academy Award... I'm still sitting on the fence about it... it was good, but it wasn't brilliant). Beautifully filmed - partly on location (Princeton Univ, NJ). This is how drama should be. "A Beautiful Mind" will make you think - Is he imagining all this? Yes he is... no he isn't, yes, no, not sure, those people in the shed behind their house ARE real, no they aren't... yes - he is delusional. DVD features include commentary by Ron Howard, deleted scenes with Howard's commentary, meeting John Nash, special effects featurette, and more. Oscar winner for best picture, best director for Howard, best supporting actress for Connelly, and best adapted screenplay. Ron Howard's movies just seem to get better and better... sheriff Andy Taylor must be proud of his favorite TV son.

$REVIEW.: Nature's Most Amazing Events takes you on a fantastic journey from the Artic to Africa.The Great Melt: The collection starts off in Arctic with a primary focus on Polar Bears and Guillemots. If you've seen Planet Earth, you will be familiar with the Polar Bear activities, but the Guillemots were fantastic as we see the young taking their first flight and learning how to feed.The Great Salmon Run: This takes place in the Pacific Northwest and follows the Salmon Run and the grizzly bears that depend on it. This was my favorite episode because I really enjoyed seeing how the Salmon travel so far and often up waterfalls to get to their birthplace. I also enjoyed the bears and their fantastic fishing techniques.The Great Migration : This takes place on the Serengeti and features the migration of the Wildebeest and their predators. A special focus is on a lion pride and their struggle to survive while waiting for the migratory animals to return.The Great Tide: The scene follows the sardines and their predators. The scale of sardines is amazing, as is the footage of the predators devouring them.The Great Flood: The next to last scene takes us to the Kalahari during the flood. Planet Earth viewers will be familiar with the elements in this scene, but it's nice to see different scenes as well.The Great Feast: The scene follows the may animals that are supported by herring feasting on the plankton.The footage of birds,sea lions, and whales is amazing. In particular, we get a close up view of the whales eating a bait ball, and the scene is stunning. It was also interesting to see the whales together doing what is called "bubble fishing".Nature's Most Amazing Events is a great series, and the camera work is stunning as I have come to expect since watching Planet Earth. Some of the footage may seem familiar if you've seen Planet Earth or other nature shows, but it doesn't detract from how well these scenes were shot.David Attenborough does a great job of narrating the series, and each scene also has a "diary" that takes you behind the scenes and shows you how some of the camera work is done. I thought this was a great addition and enjoyed seeing these folks in action.Each scene is about 45 minutes long and then has a 10-15 minute diary.This DVD will go on the shelf right next to Planet Earth, Home, Ganges and Earth: Biography as part of my nature collection.
$SUMMARY.: Absolutely Stunning Series - Planet Earth Fans Will Enjoy!

$review_text.: I knew it was ending. I knew the season would build to and ending. I was sad to see it go - at least Kyra and her partner and driver, David, who did such a good job together would leave the series. I knew there would be a spin off (Major Crimes) but Mary McDonnell, as good as she is, is still no Brenda Lee Johnson/Kyra Sedgwick. The last episode was very touching, a bit surprising, and well done. A class act as always, down to the elevator door shutting.

$review_text.: Adrien Brody plays a cop kept in check for most of the film with a little hint of his Predators awesomeness when he promises aloud to get the sadist who leaves behind such a mess.  It's trick baby vs. trick baby apparently except the baddie looks like some kind of hybrid with very tiny eyes and a strangely shaped nose and jawline - just his entire head - from the baddie's first appearance in the rear view mirror, I actually thought it was Adrien Brody - but alas ... ain't nothing like the real thing.  The Yellow is about Billy Rubin that is jaundice in babies from ingesting feces that is more prevalent in Asian babies and was a common type of torture during the Japanese invasion of China.Meanwhile, Adrien Brody although too tidy in this film should inspire an entire daily soap opera with gorgeous actors with big schnozzes - cast Lady Gaga!  I see Paz de la Huerta as his true love (and I guess the exception to the big nose school of beaute')!I didn't have a problem with half-watching this film while web surfing.  I'm not so sure that this film would have been enjoyable if I had nothing else going on.

$review_text.: This box set includes the ten best episodes of Friends, as determined by an online survey (how come I never heard about this?) The episodes are definitely great ones, but some are not the ones I would pick. Also, I can't really feel happy for Ross when he says, &quot;I just grabbed a spoon,&quot; or when he kisses Rachel for the first time, because I know how it's going to end. Plus, now that Rachel is the only friend that I have grown to hate, things I laughed at the first time I saw them are now just annoying.If you're wondering why I don't like Rachel, consider this: I admit that Ross was equally at fault for the first time they broke up, but then Rachel wreaks their chances of ever getting back together by making him say that she had absolutely nothing to do with the break-up. Hey, I'm pretty sure Ross wouldn't have slept with the xerox slut if Rachel had acknowleged their anniversary at all. It takes two to make a relationship go wrong. Also, she takes every oppurtunity to remind him she still has a grudge and will never get back together with him, but still apparantly cares enough about him to ruin every relationship he's had since. And since this isn't Seinfeld and relationships mean something, that's just wrong.Also, it goes without saying that it's a bad sign when one of the DVD highlights is interactive menus.Still, all 10 episodes are gems, and you'll definitely laugh at least once during all of them.

$REVIEW.: I really like the Firm workouts.  I've used them off and on over the past few years.  Now that I'm &#34;on&#34; again, I wanted the shorter duration workouts due to work and class constraints on my time.  If time permits, I'll do 15 - 20 minutes on the treadmill or the elliptcial, then pop a 30-minute workout in the DVD player which gets me up to the 45-minute range.  Yes, these Firm workouts are equipment-intensive, but I've accumulated most of it over the years so that's not an issue.  I've got another sculpting stick workout that I alternate with this one, along with the balance ball, express full body workouts, and small weighted ball routines.  Pam's a great instructor and this one (for me) is challenging.  Some general comments regarding all Firm workouts: 1) recommend keeping the remote nearby because some of the transitions are quick and I can't get myself in position, properly, to execute the moves without risk of injury - pause, get in position, continue; 2) keep a floor mat nearby - my knees are not as young as they used to be and I really need the cushioning (again, keep that remote handy).  It's great that these have come down in price and are readily available on Amazon.  That enables me to have many to choose from so I don't get bored with any one.  I do have some of the older 50+ minute workouts, but I find these shorter ones much more enjoyable - they move through the muscle groups quicker, yet target them effectively so you can feel the results that day and the next.
$SUMMARY.: Great workout

$REVIEW.: Theatrical review.George Clooney who not only directs, stars, produces and co-writes is also, apparently, the casting director.  He rounds up many of his old buddies and sets us on a journey as WW II draws to a close.  A true story, adapted from Robert Edsel and Bret Witter's book, "The Monuments Men" headed here by Frank Stokes (Clooney) are on a mission to save the millions of master artworks that Hitler stole from Europe.  His troop of older, out of shape art experts (Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville and Bob Balaban) spread out across the continent searching for the art as Allied forces now have Hitler retreating back to Germany.That fact alone had me scratching my head.  These guys have no transportation, little tactical support and no combat experience.  Yet Stokes breaks them up into 2 man teams and says, go boys.  The preservation of the world's greatest artworks is all on you.  The cast make the best of the situation.  One of the more interesting set ups is left a bit laboring.  Damon's character, James Granger, is dispatched alone to Paris where he finds a French clerical aid who was forced by the Nazis to catalog art taken from French museums, churches and private citizens.  Claire (Cate Blanchett), at first refuses to help believing that the Americans will just take the art back to their country.  As she queries of Granger, "Are you here to steal our stolen art?"  It would have been more interesting if Granger's character wasn't so married with kids and was available to Claire's personal needs.What Clooney has done is make a pretty darn good traditional Hollywood movie.  One that would have been cheered 40 or 50 years ago.  I'm reminded of a similar film in texture, with Steven Spielberg's "War Horse" from 2011.  Good old fashion filmmaking including modest dashes of cheese.  In spite of its shortcomings I liked the film.

$review_text.: Movies based on best-selling books are a risk in Hollywood as fans of the book often have high expectations and can grill a movie if it does not satisfy them.  The makers of the Harry Potter and LOTR movies generally pleased the book fans, whereas the makers of Troy, Dinotopia, and War of the Worlds have not pleased the book fans.  This being said, making a movie on a controversial book is an even greater risk, and The Da Vinci Code is probably one of the more controversial books to appear in the English language in the past 10 years.  But the makers of the movie did their homework alright.  First, they gathered a good cast of actors and actresses, including two of the best in Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen.  Second, they made sure to use actors that reflected the nationalities of the characters in the book.  Third, they picked a great composer to make an original soundtrack.  And last, Ron Howard was a great choice as a director.  The result is one of the best movies of 2006.I have never read the book, but I can say that this movie is very engaging and interesting.  The story starts with the killing of an important person who knows a very important secret.  The rest of the movie proceeds as a series of secrets being unraveled, with the audience finding out as the protagonists find out.  The movie ends with the female lead discovering her true identity, and the male lead finding the final resting place of Mary Magdalene.  In between are many well-done episodes of suspense, action, comedy, and drama.  The dialogue is quite good and shows each character to have a depth of experience and a complex range of drives and emotions.  The special effects are also quite good, and at numerous times, flashbacks are made to important acts in history.  These look quite impressive.This DVD set comes with multiple special features including interviews with all the principal actors and actresses.  There are also features on the soundtrack, the book, and of course, interviews with the book's author.  All in all, this was one of the best movies of 2006.
$SUMMARY.: One of a kind movie

$REVIEW.: Yes, the penguins were great as everyone says, but the lemur king and his sidekick along with their "move it, move it" song was a concoction of pure, delightful genius--an unexpected bonus ingredient of sheer unadulterated fun

The humor in this movie works as well, if not moreso, on the adult level as it will for your children
And if you aren't uncontrollably compelled to get up and dance with your children during the "move it, move it" song in all the wildest fashions that feels free, then you're not human


Great fun, but unfortunately, on second viewing on the DVD, I knew the jokes coming and it didn't have the effect on me that some great comedies do--that they get funnier on each viewing--but I bought the DVD for my six year old daughter, not for myself, and she enjoys it just as much as the first time, and the dancing we do together, oh wow! that wild family dancing in the living room!--nothing beats that in the whole world! We got the soundtrack as well

$review_text.: After watching the tepid slasher flick &quot;Slash,&quot; I asked several seemingly simple questions, none of which have easy answers. For example, I wondered aloud why we need yet another cheap, cheesy slasher film wannabe filled with annoying characters, near bloodless encounters between the baddie and the victims, and a connect the dots plot. Nonetheless, I gamely plodded through the entire movie, snorting and guffawing my way through what is largely a huge waste of time. I'll usually watch a horror movie no matter how bad it is. As a hardcore fan of the genre, I feel it necessary to absorb as much of the material out there as possible. Good or bad, I march onward through the mountains of straight to video horror DVDs, discovering that for every diamond in the rough there are dozens of other movies so bad that they'll curl your toenails. &quot;Slash&quot; leans toward the latter position; it's not the absolute worst film to come down the pipe in the last five to ten years, but it's far from good. It is, rather, a forgettable film that every filmmaker wishing to direct a horror film should watch so they know what not to do.At the center of &quot;Slash&quot; is the &quot;rock&quot; band Slash, an up and coming group of &quot;talented&quot; musicians looking for that big break. The front man for the group, &quot;Mac&quot; MacDonald (James O'Shea), hides a hideous secret. When he was a child Mac witnessed a bizarre incident involving his grandfather Jethro (Danny Keogh), an incident involving stacks of bodies and something called the blood harvest. An accident led to the sudden departure of Jethro, and shortly thereafter Mac and his mother left father and headed to the big city. Mac's managed to submerge the disturbing memories of his childhood spent on the farm until he receives word after a show that his aunt passed away. Unfortunately, the trip to the funeral could very well interfere with the band's chances to sign a recording deal with a big label. Since Mac is the main guy, the group decides to attend the services. They all hop on the bus and cruise out to the MacDonald farm for a meet and greet with Mac's wacky family. Along for the ride is the band and a few hangers on, the most important of which-and the only memorable ones-are Mac's main squeeze Suzie (Zuleikha Robinson) and angry black guy Keith (Craig Kirkwood). Things get weird quickly once they show up on the farm. It turns out some nut in a black costume's been going around rubbing people out with various farm implements, and now he or she is going to turn their focus on the members of Slash.Until the sauce starts to flow, we get a close look at the kooks on the farm. First up is Jeremiah MacDonald (Steve Railsback), a true hick in every sense of the word, who spends his time whipping up moonshine, joshing with the out of towners, and acting in a threatening manner. Jeremiah's sidekick is Billy Bob (Nick Boraine), a shuffling slow poke who takes great delight in provoking the band members, especially Keith. A few members of the band disappear because of various encounters with the man in black while Mac slowly slips into a weird trance related in no small part to his returning to the family homestead. After the funeral, where we catch a glimpse of a female version of the Crazy Ralph character from &quot;Friday the 13th,&quot; the band expects to just roll right out of Weirdsville, USA. Yeah right. Something happens to the bus (surprise!), requiring the hapless youngsters to stay at the farm until the part arrives from the big city. It sure looks as though Slash will never make that all important recording contract meeting. In fact, they'll probably need to place a few ads in the trade mags for replacement musicians by the time this whole thing wraps up.I'm wracking my brain in order to find something nice to say about &quot;Slash.&quot; The only thing I can come up with is Nick Boraine's character, Billy Bob. Boraine plays the stereotypical redneck hick quite well. Regrettably, what doesn't work at all could fill volumes. Keith, for example, is the most annoying character imaginable, a guy whose constant harping on racism tires quite quickly. And what's he doing with a gun, anyway? Too, the constant sniggering from the rest of the musicians about life on the farm sure doesn't endear these characters to a viewer. I roared with laughter when Billy Bob showed up after the concert to notify Mac about the funeral, and the whole room went completely silent as he walked in. Are city folks this afraid of someone from the countryside? Never mind the city is a thousand times more dangerous than any farm! But the worst problem plaguing &quot;Slash&quot; is the absence of gore. In a slasher film, taking it easy on the bloodshed is a crime of epic proportions. Oh sure, there are a few scenes involving a bit of the red stuff, but it's all so minor compared to other pictures that the movie should have earned a 'PG' rating instead of an 'R'. And that conclusion! Oh brother!Extras on the disc include a trivia game (yawn), and trailers for &quot;Slash,&quot; &quot;Lawless Heart,&quot; and &quot;Purpose.&quot; The movie's picture transfer is fullscreen. As a lover of B budget movies even I have to say that &quot;Slash,&quot; when it could have been a gorefest, is a borefest instead. Marred by bad acting, bad editing, bad pacing, bad effects, bad direction, and a downright abysmal soundtrack; &quot;Slash&quot; is best left lying on the video store shelf. See it if you absolutely must watch nearly every straight to video horror movie around, but don't say that I didn't warn you.

$REVIEW.: The cover claims: "The best gangster film since Goodfellas", but the quote is from some local TV station, and is quite a stretch. But this is a fairly enjoyable mob/unions/cops movie. It plays very straight-ahead, and some of the roles are played very well. Especially Christopher Walken. After his Oscar-nominated "Deer Hunter" Stevie, he became rather a caricature, but he is a very good actor and here you see yet another side of him, playing a rather old man.The movie is "based on a true story", which helps the natural feel of the event flow. And the supporting cast is terrific, with several really good mob/gangster/procedural stalwarts appearing.I've been trying to think how to exactly sum up my take on this film, and here it is: If you were stuck in some motel somewhere, flipping channels with little hope of actual entertainment, and found this movie just starting, you'd be delighted with your find and would settle in quite happily.

$REVIEW.: I first saw THE HORSE SOLDIERS when it was released in theaters in the early 1960s. It's one of those rare films Wayne made where he actually got more emotional about the female lead than his horse. If you like John Wayne in a romantic role this is the film to see (or IN HARM'S WAY with Patricia Neal, or THE QUIET MAN or MCLINTOCK with Maureen O'Hara). Wayne is often labeled as an &quot;action hero&quot; and I suppose he was but he was also funny and a great romantic lead when Hollywood let him be one. Sadly, this film may be overlooked because some fans will think it does not have enough action.I believe the female lead is Constance Horner, and the chemistry between Horner and Wayne is fabulous. The addition of Holden made the triangle complete.Wayne an officer in the Union Army during the Civil War.  He has been assigned to take a calvery unit behind enemy lines to a strategic rail site he is to destroy. The destruction of the rail site will cut off supplies for the enemy and hopefully shorten the war. Wayne is the typical loyal soldier--his is not to question why, his is but to do or die.Holden is a civilian doctor who has been drafted and he hates the war and everything it stands for.  He thinks the carnage is unnecessary and that civilized men should be able to settle things in a more humane way.  He is of the school &quot;Rich man's war, poor man's fight.&quot; Holden dislikes Wayne and vice versa.On the way South, the unit stops at a plantation house.  Since they are behind enemy lines and traveling fast they are not accompanied by a supply wagon and they must live off the land. The plantation where they stop is occupied by a young woman and her slave Lukie. The plantation mistress (Horner) overhears a discussion amoung the men about their objective, and being discovered, she is forced to accompany the men South.  She becomes Holden's helper in the medical sense, but tries at every opportunity to escape so that she can forewarn her breatheren.  The tension between the three main actors is fabulous. Over the course of the film it becomes obvious that although they are diametrically opposed in their thinking, Horner and Wayne are falling in love. Of course the good doctor Holden can see what's happening when they can't.I suppose one thing that makes your heart palpitate a bit, even if you're disabused of the notion that war has it's glorious moments is the beautiful sight of the Union Horse Soldiers.  Mounted calvery are one of the most wonderful sights in the world, and when they sing &quot;Round Her Hair She Wore A Yellow Ribbon&quot; well, what can I say.  I'm just a romantic at heart.

$REVIEW.: This movie was just bad.  Reaaaally bad.  It wasn't even bad, but fun to laugh at.  It was just bad.  The script was terrible, the dialogue was insulting to my intelligence, and the characters were completely one dimensional.  If I had watched it in the theatres, I would have walked out (which would have been a first).  And quite frankly, I'm surprised I watched the whole thing at home.  I think I was just hypnotized at how truly terrible this movie was.As an example of just how bad it was, I will summarize a particular moment that I just found completely absurd.  After just obtaining his "super powers" The Thing gets depressed (since now he looks like a rock, or would if the costume didn't make him look like an actor in a crappy costume) and The Thing decides to hide from his wife (who freaks out when she sees him, who wouldn't?) and stare at the ocean while sitting atop a large bridge.  Then, he sees a young man about to jump off the bridge to kill himself.  The Thing attempts to rescue him, a noble enough effort, but in so doing he destroys a semi, nearly killing the driver inside, destroys half the bridge and causes a massive traffic collision, endangering the lives of hundreds of people.  Everyone no doubt saw this, but yet when he "saved" this man, everyone claps, apparently forgetting that he nearly killed several people and endangered the lives of hundreds more, along with destroying half the bridge in the process.  Ridiculous.If that is not bad enough, when the "Human Torch" gains his "super powers" which literally sets himself on fire, he is not in the least bit frightened, or even surprised it seems.  He's in a hospital and a nurse takes his tempurature, which is over 200 degrees.  Her reaction?  She says "wow, you're hot." And his responce?  "Yeah, so are you."  Ha. Ha. Ha.  That is not a human response.  No one in this movie is human, and are all the result of insultingly lazy writing, terrible acting, and painfully corny dialogue that feels like it was written by a two year old.There was about five minutes of action that was pretty cool watching, but the rest of this movie was complete trash.  There were a lot of great movies in 2005.  Just look at the Oscar nominees.  I wholeheartedly guarentee ALL of them are better than The "Fantastic" Four.  Don't watch this movie, it will only encourage Hollywood to release more lazy garbage like this.
$SUMMARY.: I want my hour and a half back

$REVIEW.: Samurai 7 the Viridian Collection has all 26 episodes, is in a widescreen format, has clear audio and great graphics


The fight sceens are very detailed and so fast that you'd have to watch them in slow-mo to truly appreciate the detail


It has a good story line and you'll love all of the characters.This series takes place in a futuristic world that's just suffered through a massive war
All the villages are controlled or terrorized by the Nobuseri bandits
These men were once Samurai but chose to become machines in order to be more powerful


All the villages are suffering

The villagers are starving because the Nobuseri are taking all the rice they grow; though some villagers tried to rebel against this injustice they were too weak and paid dearly.But one village has no other choice but to try and resist the Nobuseri or they will surely parish

The elder decides the only way they'll have a chance is to hire 7 strong samurai to help them
The village sends it's water priestess, Kirara, to find these men and bring them to the village.There are many adventures and quite a bit of intrigue in the royal merchant court

Only by watching this series from start to finish will you discover how and if these samurai can save the village.I suggest this series to anyone who loves swordfights, adventure and good clean fun


It's a good series for anyone over the age of 13, due to some graphic violence

For $28.00 it'd be a shame to let this series go by.

$review_text.: Anyone hoping for The Original Series-level re-imaging will be disappointed - this isn't that kind of restoration. TOS BDs are nothing short of amazing, which unfairly set a high bar for anything that might come from The Next Generation; This series did not suffer from the complete deterioration that the original had. What is apparent in this three episode sampler is that the goal appeared to be to make it look great for big, high-definition tvs - and it succeeds 100%. Don't look for a brand-new tentacley-giant-jellyfish monster in 'Encounter at Farpoint' - the horrible cliche "see it as you have never seen it before" is more to the point, and to that end it delivers as promised.
$review_summary.: Very well-done samples....

$REVIEW.: Enjoyed having to watch two seasons in one but also just the fact that it is funny

If you want to laugh a little then watch this

This might be mature and older so read for the specs.

$REVIEW.: I'm sorry but I'm never getting sick of John C. Reilly. That's the way my life is going to always be. I'll like it like that forever. Better get used to it, momma.Let's take a look back at this guy's career, shall we? But let's also make it brief because I'm trying to review `Step-Brothers', not write my Masters Thesis in `High Hilarity in the Career of John C. Reilly'.Anyone one remember `What's Eating Gilbert Grape'? I don't either but I damn sure remember Reilly's break out killer uproarious role in `Boogie Nights' when he played Marky Mark's bestest friend. He made that movie perfect for me and has been making movie after movie just the best ever since- `Chicago Cab', `The Perfect Storm', `Gangs of New York' and who could forget the crazy hijinks of `Dark Water' about them dead kids on the roof- oh yes, John C. Reilly is obviously the Don Rickles of our generation.And if you pee'd your pants 7 times over watching `Walk Hard- The Dewey Cox Story' (it was an amusingly awkward matinee at the Mann's Cinema 16 Plaza that day) then `Step Brothers' will defiantly be kind of a let down because that damned Will Farrell is in about half of it.Sorry, momma, he's going to always be double great for the both of us. Shake-n-bake!
$SUMMARY.: I'm Sorry, Momma, I Just Love John C. Reilly.
