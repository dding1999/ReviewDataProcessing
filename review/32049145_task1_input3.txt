$REVIEW.: This is a very solid, yet inexpensive case. It looks pretty stylish and low key (I don't like the gaudy, crazy looking cases). And the great part is that it has a lot of space... and I mean a lot. Here's the details:3 x 5.25&#34; bays (think CD/DVD drives)8 x internal 3.5&#34; bays (hard drive bays)7 x expansion slots2 x front USB ports7 x fan spots (1 fan included)fits pretty much any motherboard (ATX, Mini-ATX, Micro-ATX, Flex-ATX, Mini-ITX)bottom mounted power supplycomes with tons and tons of screws for everything imaginableThere is fairly good cable management as well, between the inside case wall and the side panel.However, there are some things you should know before buying it (note: none of these are worth knocking down a star for me)- The front USB ports are upside down.- The motherboard is not mounted upside down, so look for a power supply with longer cables if you plan on using the cable management. On mine, the cables can't go in the slots and still reach the top of the motherboard. They reach just fine going straight there though.
$SUMMARY.: This is becoming my long-term case

$review_text.: Connecting to a device through a serial port is not always easy with today's laptops, the older laptops had a built in serial port and you merely plugged the cable into the device and set the serial port parameters. Now to save weight and money laptops have USB ports and you can almost plug anything into these, but connecting to an older serial port used to be a real challenge.However using this USB adapter made it easy again. Every device I wanted to connect to, professional sound DSP, telecom router, internal alarm system, all worked flawlessly. The prolific chipset drivers were available for Win XP, Vista and 7 and all 3 versions worked well.It was nice that the drivers were included in a disk, but I did find an updated one for Win 7 on the web site.I have wasted too much time with the cheap knockoffs and actually had one adapter damage the UART chip of a professional sound DSP device. Don't waste your money, buy this one and it will work flawlessly. Save your time and money and but this device because it works!Plugable Technologies delivered on time as well, also if you buy a number of items then definitely explore becoming an Amazon PRIME member as the free shipping makes it easy to find all those small items you may not have purchased when the shipping costs were 25% of the price of the item.

$REVIEW.: I had watched this webcam to see if it ever went below "overpriced" and it finally did, so I bought a two-pack for a really good price.  I was disappointed to say the least.  The camera is grainy and while it does have good color reproduction the graininess and lack of speed over the USB 2.0 bus was alarming.  All the reviews touted the glass lens, as if that matters, when it's the sensors in this camera that is the main disappointment.  Pictures are over-saturated and low-light exposure is overly grainy.  The thing is, these two combine for a low-quality picture that doesn't compress well over an internet connection due to all the grain and blurriness.Even though this aging, expensive camera is now available a more reasonable price, I still recommend trying the new store-brand, generic UVC cameras instead of this one.  This camera is outdated and not really a good value.  The $25 generic UVC camera is definitely a much better value and delivers a better picture than this one.The Lifecam software has great effects that are a lot of fun.  I hope the newer generation of Microsoft cameras are better when it comes to picture quality and frame rate without blurrying.

$review_text.: I decided to use a hard drive dock (Voyager Q) for backup and needed a storage/carry case for taking a copy of the HD off-site. This one is nicely padded and works great. I keep my bare HD in the anti-static bag it came in and place in this case. I just wish it didn't have the silkscreening on it, but I guess they need to advertise their brand/product. It's also larger than you I expected, but that's due to the amount of foam padding for protection, so no big deal.

$review_text.: This case is exactly what I wanted. It's lightweight and I love that the keyboard is removable. It's not bulky at all and super easy to use. I've had other keyboards before where the Bluetooth connectivity has to be reconnected each time. This one doesn't have that issue at all. I just connect and it works automatically. I love it. It's completely great and exactly what I wanted. :-)The only thing I would change is the stand for the keyboard. Sometimes it falls when I move the table, but otherwise it is pretty stable. I would just make it sturdier and not let it be held by a strand. I like this keyboard a lot! I didn't particularly like the hardshell one I had in the past, so this one fits the bill pretty well and it is very affordable!

$review_text.: This is a really good cable although the cable is a little thicker than the Apple branded ones so may not be compatible with 3rd party accessories. More specifically, I got the EverDock which has a gap in the bottom for you to weave your cable through and the cable was too thick to fit. Luckily though, you can never seem to have too many iPhone cables.

$REVIEW.: I love wi-fi radios and have a Pandora One account and also a Sirius account. I don't think there is a room in my house that does not stream some sort of internet radio whether it be a Chumby, Roku, or through my iPod touches.Opening the box I liked that the unit it small. It has a big plug, I tried it in the kitchen but the plug is so big I was not able to plug back in an air freshener to the top plug because the Mondo took so much room in the outlet.Once plugged in, I found my wireless network and entering the password I had to laugh. Get ready to spin the dial in front up and down and all around. Once connected, it asked if I wanted a firmware upgrade, which of course I did.I went and logged into my Sirius account, again be prepared to be patient and sit there spinning the dial all over the place. One typo is hard to fix. I went into the settings and changed the clock, it will display it in 12 format or 24. I also wanted to register the device; you just go to the website and enter in the code that is provided on the screen on the Mondo.  Once registered, it will display a screen with many options such as "Get more stuff". I am glad I clicked it because you can link your accounts through your computer and you do not have to sit there and spin the dial like crazy. This was a nice feature. I added Pandora through this feature and it linked it right away. I love that Pandora is integrated on the device and also on the remote. Quick thumbs up or fast forward right there without trying to find it, great feature! The next option on the website is to "Manage My Stuff". This is where you can manage your station, your streams, and your podcasts. The last is "Manage My Radios". It will display the unit you have registered and if you have more than one you would select it here.I like that the unit comes with a remote. The remote is rather bulky though. I am used to iHome devices that have really small remotes and the size of a lighter and really thin. This is about half the size of a TV remote and thick. It works OK but I found using the buttons on the device a lot easier to navigate around than the remote. It does come with batteries which is a plus. It also comes with audio cables if you want to hook it up to your home stereo system. Since I have all the channels I want streaming from my Rokus, that is not a feature I will use but it is nice to have. It also has an AUX jack if you want to plug in a MP3 device. Plus a USB input as well.One great thing, if you add a channel through the website, it lets you know the kbps that it is broadcasted in. I think that is important, you want to make sure you are getting a high stream. I will admit I could not get a lot of the stations to play even when associating them to the correct program. Several did not work, but when they did, it was nice to sample it on my laptop and add the channel to my list and know it will be in my station list on the unit.From the main unit it has my weather built in; it shows the weather for several days with one click, or dial! It has my local fm stations which you are able to record through the DAR.fm, which is a free service. It has a built in equalizer or presets to choose from. I can't think of one feature it does not have!Right now my favorite device in my home is either my iPod touch that I kept docked on my iHome or streaming my Pandora through an Acer tablet through a Bluetooth speaker. However, this device has everything my other favorite units have, and it is all built in! The sound is wonderful! I have kept it in the kitchen and usually stream a new age station on Pandora while cleaning or if cooking/cleaning I turn it to Sirius and listen to Hair Nation, I am a metalhead at heart. Very impressed with this unit, I have never owned a Grace unit but they have proved they are up there with the other competitors.Updated on January 30, 2012: I use this product every day I am in my kitchen. I had to forgo my air freshener since it takes my whole outlet but the trade off was worth it! Every time I am in the kitchen I am listening to the channels. I did want to add that if you add Sirius, you must have a main subscription then you add the internet radio part to your account, it cost $3.50 a month. With that you are able to get regular channels internet radio only, which to me is great. I tried to see what live365 was about but did not like their channels and found their prices to be extremely high if you want commercial free. I believe it was $71.40 billed every 12 months for the cheapest per month subscription. I am a hard core Pandora fan and user and pay $36 I believe a year to have commercial free, more skips, and higher streaming quality. The Mondo is Pandora friendly so it really suits my needs. I did try out iheartradio which is another application and I like it so far. It is like Pandora, just not as sophisticated, it is also free.Updated March 26, 2012: I still am in love with this radio as much if not more than the day I got it. I have it in the kitchen and did a firmware upgrade on my router and noticed after I could not get connected to the Mondo. It kept saying enter saved key and kept me in a loop. It also would say connecting and not buffer. It was easy to understand it was my router, and not the radio. I went back to the older firmware and it still was not working. One of my friends asked if it the signal was possibly being blocked to the radio. Living in a small home I discounted that. The radio does let you see your wifi signal strength and mine was reading 5%. I then unplugged it and brought it into another room and it read 100% percent signal and immediately connected and buffered. I then moved it back to the kitchen and noticed the wall it was next to has a lot of metal in it. Once I pull the radio away from the wall the signal goes straight up and I stay connected now. Basically if you have problems connecting, trying plugging it into another room, see if that works. Something might be interfering with the signal. I also wanted to add I never use the remote that came with it. However, I did download from the Apple app store an application called, "grace digital- remote control". I kept searching for grace radio, so be sure you look up grace digital. Once you load the app it finds your radio on the wifi network. It then loads the song that is playing in Pandora and has the Pandora interface. I LOVE it. I will take a picture of it and upload it to the gallery to show you the difference. It has a color image of what is playing and the thumbs up, down, volume control, skip, etc. I love it because I keep my iPod touch with me and it is easier than the remote.Update March 28, 2012: Since I like this radio so much I want to have the flexibility to take it from room to room. I sometimes stay in the kitchen if a good song is on, I want to be able to unplug the unit and carry it with me. Plus, I am moving into a much bigger house with a lot more room and land, meaning a large deck. I wanted to get the rechargeable battery and noticed it was almost 35 on Amazon. I then noticed it was almost 40 on Grace Digital. I looked online for coupons but found none. I ended up calling and spoke to Megan at Grace who was very polite. She said she would give me 20% of which the battery was about 32 and free ground shipping. Once I get the battery, I will review and link it from here.Update March 28, 2013: I can't believe it has been a year since I updated this. My mondo is still used daily in my home and looks like new! I have moved it into a bathroom so my daughter can get ready with it and I can use it when on that side of the house. I bought the battery back from Grace so I am able to unplug the radio and take it into any room with me. I love the bigger clock display. If I could change one thing about it, it would be while the music is playing that the time in the lower left was a bigger. I have to be right in front of it to see the time, it is small. But otherwise I use it primary for Pandora and just LOVE it!

$REVIEW.: These docking speaker systems are all different and just about the same.  They all have a gimmick and the sound is virtually identical to any other model (in its price range).  Right out of the box I had no problems, as it immediately set the time to local time.  Next was the ballbreaker.  I had SO much trouble setting the alarms; I was just about ready to give up.  Using the remote was the best way to set the clock, which leaves one in trouble if it is lost, and it is small and wafer thin.  Instead of using my iPhone or a music station, I just set it to one of the six nature sounds.  I chose Thunderstorm.  The other gimmick is the Mood Light.  You can set it to any of the several `colors'.  It's not a bad feature, as you can see the clock and the blue digits of the clock very clearly at night.  This also has six settings of brightness.The back has a 3.5mm Line In for auxiliary music sources, a video out jack, a USB charging port (nice feature) and the AC adapter jack (there is a lithium battery in the base of the clock in  the event of an outage).So this clock is not ugly, has a lot of gimmicks, lots of little features, but is hard as hell to set.  But the clincher for me was the docking port.  There is a small back-flap that holds your iPhone/iPad in the back, but the port itself will ONLY work if there is NO case on your iPhone (Otter box, etc.).  I won't be taking my Otter box on and off every night and morning just to make it work on this clock.  You can purchase an extender, but that really shouldn't be necessary.  I would suggest shopping around and reading more reviews until you find one that works just for you!UPDATE:  It may just be my model, but after one week all functions other than the clock simply stopped working.  Uh, this is not good.

For bodies, get this;  for lenses, get the 3157N.The only downside is that the camera doesn't sit as nicely when off the tripod.  That seems to apply to any quick release, and I'm not sure what they'd do to fix it.

$REVIEW.: I was considering getting the GA6400 before finally deciding that I would step it up for the 240hz model since it's cinema screen was much more impressive and it's design is more pleasing in my opinion. It arrived well packaged and quickly from Paul's TV and I even got a free 2 year extra warranty from them to go with it. I love LG's passive 3D, it works just as well as the active even though it's not full 1080p on 3D modes. I usually side with Samsung products but both LG and Samsung are Korean competitors that have been doing well this year. Samsung has active 3D and most of their TVs are assembled in China while this one and the GA6400 my parents own are assembled in Mexico. Google's operating system is very android like in many ways as expected and the magic remote with qwerty is something I enjoy using when networking. I love the TV and I wouldn't want any other when it comes to High quality LED/LCD.

$review_text.: If you are, like I was, looking for a 40"-42" flat screen television for a secondary room (bedroom/den) then this Toshiba is worthy of consideration.  The picture quality is very good, its digital tuner is sensitive (ie, brings in lots of stations), and its priced very competitively.  My only complaints are:- you will need to fiddle plenty with the color controls to get something that looks decent.  Out of the box I found flesh tones looked very orange-y.- the audio is fairly weak.  Hooking the system up to a stereo/av receiver is almost a necessity.So when price is considered this Toshiba unit is very good.  Take price out of the equation and it is only fair/good.  Buying this for a secondary room makes perfect sense.

My unity worked fine for several months before the signal would begin to frequently cut out in one second segments.  Before breaking down and purchasing a different model I opened mine, voiding any possibility of returning it, and soldered in an additional power source to the adapter contacts, it has worked fine since.  This does leave several questions unanswered, why does it not come with a power adapter, why does it need additional power and why does it appear to work fine at first.  Given one star not only for its deteriorating performance but my needing to modify the unit as it does not use a common barrel connector for its additional power jack.

$review_text.: I bought this charger after my old charger finally died after wear and tear. It is a decent price for a laptop charger and it is very versatile.Pros:-- Small and compact: Compared to most laptop chargers which are huge and bulky, it is very lightweight and the cord can easily be organized.-- Plenty of tips: It comes with many tips including an iPod charger. If there are any missing tips, then you can order it free on the Targus website plus $5 for shipping.-- Dual charging capabilities: This charger can charge two things at a time. Very useful when you want to charge your laptop as well as another item such as your phone or iPod. That means you can carry less chargers when traveling.Cons:-- Overheating Problem: This charger gets really hot. If you're not careful, you could burn yourself while its charging. When it is finished charging your laptop, it gets more cool. I think this charger is great for smaller/less powerful laptops. If you are using your laptop for gaming or high-intensity situations, the charger starts to overheat. It makes a buzzing noise and shuts off and on. You'll notice it if your power settings on your laptop changes your screen lighting.-- Missing some essential tips: Though it comes with a lot of tips, it did not come with a microUSB tip, which charges most phones now-a-days. You have to order it from the website, which is a little inconvenient. It also doesn't have tips that you can order on their website for some gaming devices, such as PSP or Nintendo DS.-- Short Cord: If you are used to long power cords, this may be inconvenient for you. Sometimes, if working in a library or a coffee shop, the outlet is not right next to where you are sitting. This means you will not be able to charge your laptop if you are sitting too far. The cord is probably around 5.5 feet which is pretty short compared to the cords you get with your laptop.-- Won't charge some Dell's: The tip that is supposed to charge the Dell Inspiron 1500 doesn't really charge. It gives it power but is unable to charge the laptop battery. This could be at fault that some Dell laptops require more power to charge their batteries. It is kind of disappointing as it defeats the purpose if it cannot charge the laptop. I've only tested this charger on Sagers and Dells and do not know about other laptops.Overall, I think it is a decent laptop charger. For the price, it is a very good value. It charges my laptop fine and is very convenient as I charge my phone when necessary too. I think the biggest thing for me is the overheating problem and the short cord. It is frustrating to have to pause on what you're doing to wait until the charger cools down or find an outlet right next to you. It does save you money but if you can deal with these problems, it is the best charger for you.

It sometimes hangs in the fabric underneath and the zipper even &#34;derailed&#34; and jammed once which took quite an effort to get back on track. Despite this occasional problem I am well pleased with this purchase.

$REVIEW.: This machine would be great if it worked like the manual says it should. First off, the controls are not, NOT intuitive, the labels notwithstanding. After owning it for a few months, I just got past the "Basic Playback" after fiddling and experimenting with the controls. This was necessary because the manual is wrong. Here is EXACTLY what it says:Basic Playback Operation:1. Access the main screen.2. Use Left/right double arrow to select the file you want to play3. Press [play/pause] to play the file.This procedure does NOT work. After a lot of fiddling with the buttons, I finally figured out what does work, just to play a song:1. Access main screen2. Press Finder3. Press Page up/down to find folder4. Press Confirm [Red button]5. Press Stop6. Press Finder [again]7. Press Page up/down to find song8. Press Select [Confirm]9. Press Play/pause to play fileIf you can remember all this, you are better than I am.Buyers should also be aware that the R-05 Update Readme.pdf states: "* Be sure to power the unit using the AC adaptor. Executing the update while running on only battery power may cause the update to fail and result in incorrect operation if the batteries go dead before the update finishes."The AC adapter is a $22 optional extra.

$review_text.: ACT I:Got this player at Best Buy nearly a month ago

 One evening, out of the blue (no pun intended), the player started sliding the images right to left

 I've never seen anything like it


 Starting with the DVD's menu, it started sliding images at lightning speed, right to left


 After trying a few things, I unplugged the player and plugged it back again

 It seemed to reset itself.ACT II:All worked well for another day
 Now, all of a sudden, it will not recognize the HDMI connection, graying out the option in the video settings (note that the option worked until tonight).So, moral of this 2 act story: back to Best Buy tomorrow to return the player
 Glad I got their extended warranty, chances are I will get refund or exchange

 Do I want a replacement unit of the same model? Probably not.The EndUPDATE:Replaced this unit with the Samsung BD P3600
 The machine died after 24 hours!  Replaced it again with the LG BD390
 WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Loading times are lightning fast

 Every disc I throw at it plays
 Netflix streaming is impeccable (SONY BDP s350 does not offer this)


 HDMI connectivity is detected AUTOMATICALLY, so no need to make selections the player may decide not to allow


 Allows for different audio and video resolutions

 Overall, I will go with the LG over and over again.

$REVIEW.: Pros:Arrived right on scheduleHolds up my 46&#34; Samsung nicelyExtends to a good rangeComes with tons of different screws for pretty much any tv you haveCons:None. The only thing I could possibly think of as a con would be that if your tv is big mine was 46&#34; you will have a bit of extra assembly. You'll have to install 4 diagonal pieces on each corner but that's easy to do and if your mounting a tv i'm sure you can put the mount together.I really like this mount. Just make sure to get your bolts into a stud, you don't want your tv falling off the wall and breaking. Also remember to measure between the top of the mount bracket and your television to determine how high you want your television to be so you don't strain your neck while viewing. If the difference is 12 inches your tv will sit 12 inches higher than where you place your mount.
$review_summary.: Great mount you should never buy a mount in store.

$REVIEW.: These headphones are awesome, I actually wasn't expecting them to sound so clear. Usually I use the in-ear headphones, but these have much better quality than any of the Sony or Apply in-ear headphones I've used. The nice thing about these are you don't feel the pressure in your ear like in-ears make.The only thing that I am struggling with is getting the these headphones to clip on my ear, they tend to be a little more tricky than just plugging in the in-ear. That may be because I am not use to these clip-ons yet. They are the type that hang on your ear.They are quite secure though once you get them on. Overall a very nice product, would recommend to people who want a clear sound and medium amount of bass, I wouldn't say they blast out a lot of bass if that's what your looking for.

$REVIEW.: This is an awesome portable projector. I love it. Just make sure you check the specs and everything before you purchase so that you aren't dissapointed with the product once you get it. It is exactly as advertised. I suggest using it for recreational purposes only. Family night movies, parties - not every day use.The size is amazing. I pop this sucker into my suitcase when we visit the in-laws. It has an HDMI port too, so you aren't forced to only use it with the Roku stick. We like to hook it up to our Xbox or PS3 and stream movies that way. The Roku stick and internet streaming is great too, but if you don't have a stable connection, at least you know you can hook your gaming systems up to it. (We've also played video games on it- amazing seeing your gaming that big!)The images aren't particularly sharp- during configuration it says "720p." This doesn't bother me- when I was watching a bluray streamed through the PS3, it looked much better than I had expected. Also, the projection is very dim- make sure your room is dark for best viewing.

$REVIEW.: I am a full-frame guy myself, but I thought I would give this new mirrorless camera a shot to see how it performed.  I must say that the performance is really excellent, especially for the price point.  The sensor produces clean and relatively noise-free images up to about 3200 ISO before introducing slight noise.  This is perfect for most photography that you will be doing, especially if you are looking into a less expensive model such as this.  The image quality is also really quite good and the lens, while a bit tight on the focus ring, seems very nice and solidly built.The -4 to +3.5 diopter allows for a good range of personal diopter adjustment and this is very important when you are using a non-point-and-shoot camera.  The adjustment is easy and smooth, and the control stays solid once adjusted.  This adjustment is very important to people who wear glasses, as the adjustment range is good enough to make it so that many people who wear glasses will be able to shoot without glasses.I think that the design of this camera (aesthetic looks) was a great choice.  This camera looks like a DSLR instead of Sony's other mirrorless cameras.  Maybe I am just accustomed to the DSLR look, as my personal cameras are a Canon 5D Mk III and a Canon 6D, but I really do think that this is a nice looking camera that fits well into the hand.  The bulge on the right-hand side of the camera provides a comfortable grip like DSLR cameras and will allow you to shoot better and with more stability.The display on the back of the camera is not as good as I would like, but it is functional and you will be able to tell what you are doing.  At the end of the day, you aren't going to view your pictures on your camera, you are going to view them on your computer and then print.  Still, I think a higher-resolution/DPI screen would be a nice change to this camera.The camera has a fairly extensive manual setting that you should really learn to use, as you will be able to get the best performance out of your camera when you understand your shutter speeds, ISO, aperture, etc.  This camera is a great place to start learning and working, and it is also good for people who already understand these settings.  This will be an amazing step up for people who are accustomed to using a point-and-shoot camera.RECOMMENDED 4/5 stars

$REVIEW.: Before purchasing an antenna I read several reviews on Amazon for a few different antennas

Considering price ($36) and performance I chose this antenna

This antenna is better than the standard "rabbit ears" antenna that I had before
With my old antenna I was not able to get FOX or ABC along with some UHF channels
With this antenna I am now able to get those stations along with some other UHF channels
It's not perfect as I do have to make adjustments if I want to get certain UHF channels, but it does receive the most popular UHF and VHF stations fairly well
As far as setting it up goes...I was able to set it up and connect it in less than 5 minutes without reading the directions so it is fairly easy
I did have to re-scan my TV channels after connecting it though


I also priced this antenna at other places on the web and it was cheapest at Amazon


If you're looking for a low cost, good working antenna then this should do the job for you.


$SUMMARY.: It works good for me

Their construction is typically very poor (and sometimes, down-right dangerous!) and the watt ratings of the cheap units are complete lies.  Not so with this well built Antec unit.This Antec unit is conservatively rated at 450w and well built.  It installed in an ATX chassis and replaced the extremely cheap 250w power supply "junk" that HP puts into their Pavilion desktop PCs.  I guess HP figures the buyers of their PCs will never know just how much they cut corners inside their desktops.Installation of the Antec easy and this unit has lots of different connectors to cover all the bases.

$REVIEW.: This is a perfect device if you have two computers with PS/2 keyboard and mouse interfaces and you want to use both of the computers on a single monitor with a single set of speakers, basically letting you jump back and forth between the two computers
If you want to use a USB mouse or keyboard, this is not the correct adapter, you will rather want this:Syba SY-KVM20051 USB Interface, 2x Ports Cable KVM Switch, Compact Design, Video up to 2048x1536 Pixels, with Wired Remote Switch
I do not understand the negative reviews regarding the technology related to this product
It is exactly what is advertised make sure that it is what you need (PS/2 - the green and purple ports - and not USB).Installation was incredibly easy
Basically you plug the common end into your monitor and your mouse, keyboard, and speakers


Then then other two ends go into your two computers
You switch between the two computers using the keyboard stroke patterns preset in the hardware

It honestly couldn't be easier
Great product that just works.

$review_text.: Looking for a travel tripod that is very short collapsed but not a table top; light enough and short enough to put in my bag and carry as my standard set of equipment.  This tripod gets down to just under 11 inches; or you can take the pan head off and it is 10 1/4".  This is short enough for either of my travel bags.  Although it's a bit wobbly, I have had great success with it when using a timed or external shutter release.  Run a cord to the ground and use you foot to hold it down, and it stabilizes well.There are two problems with this tripod.  First, the pan head is small and flimsy, and doesn't lock the tilt very well.  A large camera will drift up or down.  Second, it is nearly impossible to level the camera with the horizon.  Although it is possible to open fewer than all 8 sections on any leg, the legs do not have fine adjustment on the length, .  And the legs really need to be spread out to be stable.  So there is not enough flexibility to get a precise level.You can attach a ball head onto the pan head, and put the camera on the ball head; that solves the leveling issue but not the drift issue, and adds weight.  What I did was remove the pan head and attach the ball head directly to the tripod legs.  I used a 1/4-20 x 3/8 Socket Cap Screw, a Heavy Duty 1/4" Female to 3/8" Male Bushing Adapter, and a Redged Professional R-0 Ball Head.  This holds my Panasonic FZ-200 without problem.  And I've even used it to hold the FZ-200 with 1.7x tele adapter, but with a tripod mount ring attached to the adapter tube to balance weight.  Total cost for this modified tripod is less than $60.  And it's light, long, and sturdy enough to use as an extender arm as well (with a remote shutter release).Now my standard kit is the camera, a filter pouch (with polarizer, ND400, ND8, graduated ND, +3 macro), remote shutter release, extra battery, ball head and modified tripod legs, and Metz 28 CS-2 with Ultra-Pod.  Super compact, light, and ready for nearly any kind of shot.  If you like this kind of photography, then this is the tripod to get.

$REVIEW.: When we buy products we are very happy about, we tend to have an overly extreme reaction, just like we would if the product was terrible - but I have tried to make this review without emotion and as objective as I could.Pros:-Solid ends [cable to male connector]-Fits snugly into ports-Heavy duty cable housing-Flexible joint to allow for natural bending of cable/connector area without damage-Great price [this isn't your typical cheap Wal-Mart or flimsy custom built cable - despite the price - it's well made]Cons:-Although not unbearably or abnormally so, the cable housing is a little too stiff for my liking [but they have another line of cables for that purpose]
$SUMMARY.: Without Exaggeration: 9/10 - Solid Cable

$review_text.: Using this single antenna, I was able to get reception on 3 TVs connected with over 200 feet of RG-6 to this single antenna which was mounted outside on a steel satellite dish pole low to the ground
 Even though the antenna is blocked by obstructions and low, it still picked up all channels with no booster
Very impressed.

 Of course it is solid and provides great protection for the device but the cost is a lot of bulk and a lot of added weight; not to mention the very high cost


After using it for a week, I really can't see what all the fuss is about on the Otterbox.

$review_text.: Given that this radio carries the Red Cross brand, I had reasonably high expectations for it. What I found was a product of poor quality and performance- very low value given the price. Unfortunately, it was not my first experience with an Eton / ARC brand radio. But it will be my last.PROS: For as long as it played, the sound quality was great.CONS:1. The small and large knobs on the side feel loose and very cheap-feeling. Like they're not connected to the guts securely.2. The power source can be three AA batteries which will run the radio for maybe 8 hours and a rechargeable battery pack that we never did figure out how to charge. There's a mini-USB port on the back and the instructions imply that you can charge the ni-cad batteries with an ordinary mini-USB charger such as what's used with many cell phones but several different chargers didn't work with this radio. Maybe solar or hand crank as a charger? Don't know- never could figure it out.3. The power knob (side, top) was impossibly confusing. Be VERY careful how you leave that knob. Even with the radio off, the batteries are consumed.4. The radio suffered a drop of 6" from hand to kitchen counter; just what you might expect in the dark if you bumped into it. That broke the battery cover locking tabs and so we had to use scotch tape to hold the battery cover on.All in all, American Red Cross, you should be embarrassed. Bottom line is that you would NEVER want to depend on this radio for use in an emergency.

$REVIEW.: In terms of photographic usability..

the Nikon D3200 is excellent


It's fast, comfortable to hold and shoot with, the menu system is intuitive, and LCD is much improved over the D3100
It feels solid and well-made and could stand up to the weight of a more pro-grade lens.The camera has solid image quality but perhaps slightly inferior noise performance when compared to its predecessor


If you are an everyday, casual shooter and not shooting much at ISO1600 and above (and not blowing your images up to huge sizes or doing heavy cropping) you will be perfectly happy with the picture quality from this camera
Especially if you're stepping up from a point and shoot
The camera displays good color reproduction, and the 18-55 kit lens is probably one of the best kit lenses to be offered by a cameramaker out there in terms of its optical performance

Dynamic range is excellent
It does overexpose some, so you might want apply some negative exposure compensation in bright conditions (other Nikon DSLRs have had this issue in the past as well).One disappointing feature that was on the D3100 but not of the D3200 is the drive mode switch on the top of the camera near the mode-dial
Also the switch between movie and video has been replaced with a button.The video is pretty good on this camera


I have not messed around too much with the video but from the footage I have taken so far, the video has been sharp and clean.Even though there is a slight drop in the imaging performance on this camera (again, unlikely to be noticed by casual shooters and even enthusiasts), I still reccommend it over the older D3100 due to the increase in performance and the higher LCD resolution


A very enjoyable camera to shoot with and will provide many years of great photos and dependable operation.

$review_text.: UPDATE: As the comment below states, my problem seems to have been caused by a setting on the PS3 called 'Deep Color' mode. After turning this off, I've not noticed any more issues with the sound cutting out. I've since updated my score from 3 to 4 stars.I've had this HTIB for almost a year. I have it hooked up to an LG TV and have an XBox 360, PS3, DirecTV box, and Wii hooked up to the receiver. I'm using all the original speakers, and I bought separate speaker wire for the back speakers, because the included wire would not reach. The sound is great for my medium sized living room, and the surround sound is pretty immersive. I live in a duplex, so I keep the sub down pretty low, but when I've turned it up, it seemed adequate. I'm no audiophile, but I owned one HTIB before this (a cheap Samsung ~$150).The receiver works well with my Harmony 700 and handles switching inputs wonderfully. I really only have one complaint about the receiver, and that is the sound will cut out periodically. For about the 6 months or so, I'm not sure I noticed it at all. However, more and more often I will be watching a movie and the sound will cut out for about 2-3 seconds then come right back. The video never cuts out, and the sound is still sync'd properly when it comes back. I first noticed it the most while using my PS3 to watch Blu-ray or DVD (new slim version, 250GB). However, I've noticed it a few times while watching content from my DirecTV receiver as well. Now it doesn't do this all the time, maybe 15-25% of the times I am using the receiver, and sometimes it will do it 3 or 4 times during a movie, or sometimes just once and then be fine.I've done just a bit of Googling and some people say it can happen if your receiver is being over-loaded and happens more when loud scenes are playing, but I've found this not to be true in my case as it will happen during normal dialog scenes. I haven't called Onkyo support (I hear they aren't he most helpful), or tried much troubleshooting. For the price I paid for it, I'm happy with its performance. That being said, when I do upgrade to a new system, I probably won't be getting another Onkyo.

 All the buttons on the tab are still accessible
The folding stand feature is nice, but the tab will have a tendency to slip down

 The only issue we have with the cover is when you fold the cover back on itself to hold the tab like a book, the tab screen goes blank
 We remover the small metal piece on the cover thinking that is was the cause, but the tab still will go blank when the cover is folded back.

$REVIEW.: I bought these for their compact size water resistance. I also bought the cobra cxr825. I love the form factor of these MH230 radios - they are a great size, feel great in the hand and very simple to operate with minimal buttons and options. I was looking forward to using them while skiing with family. They worked great at home while testing them out.Here's the problem. I didn't end up using the MH230's on the slopes because they wouldn't work side by side - I had both radios set on the same GMRS channel, both radios set to the same privacy code, and wasn't able to transmit from one to the other. With the CXR825s set to the same channel and privacy code I was able to transmit and hear on the Motorola units. I thought maybe there was interference so I changed to a different channel and privacy code combo but same problem.Now at home I decided to test more carefully. Initially the motorolas worked fine. Then did more testing and at some point the motorolas stopped transmitting. What I found when scanning channels is that one of the motorolas was 15 channels off - I know, hard to believe but found that the cobra CXR825 and one of the Motorola MH230's were set to channel 18 privacy code 1 and the other MH230 was set to channel 3 privacy code and all communicated with each other. So I can't explain it but I definitely witnessed that one of the Motorola's wasn't transmitting on the correct channel.Haven't ever seen anyone describe this weird situation so I chalk it up to a defective unit. Definitely returning them.Also my review would be incomplete without mentioning that the chargers are terrible - the walkies do not fit snugly in the cradle.However - let me say this - I really do LOVE these little walkies b/c they are a great size and water resistant. They'd be even better if they transmitted at higher power like 2 or 5W (or allowed L/M/H settings) and if they were water proof while staying this small :-)If not for the defective unit and glitch in operation I would be all over these for future use.

$review_text.: I bought this APC RBC17 replacement through Amazon and it stopped working after 12 months plus a few days of use. The original APC battery lasted 4 years. I've had better experience with non-OEM UPS batteries, with lifetimes varying from two to five years. Given the higher cost of the OEM battery, I expected the battery to last at least as long as APC says at the low end ("Expected Battery Life (years) 3 - 5"). It did work during the warranted one year period, (powering my computers during a few small power outages and one longer than an hour) which is why I'm not rating this it only one star.

$review_text.: My daughters are learning digital art

 Their teacher recommends Wacom Intuos4 medium which is what their studio uses

 The Wacom Bamboo model may be a good choice for beginner if you are not sure if the user will continue learning art


 For more advance users (or anyone more than a beginner), Intuos should be the choice


 The medium one measures 10 (inches) by 14.5 while the center touch pad is 6 by 9

 The small one is too small, in my opinion, while the large one is expensive
 But if you can afford it, the bigger one is definitely better

 The tablet uses USB interface
 We did not install any driver
 It performs just like a mouse (actually it does come with a mouse shape handler in addition to the pen) but with much better precision

$REVIEW.: I purchased this in-dash navigation system from BestBuy three months ago.  Installation was very easy because I was able to find my e-brake and foot brake wires. If you don't locate these two wires, the unit will not start.The unit is actually a pretty good one with a tone of features. I have yet to master all of them. The micro and bluetooth work very well. My incoming calls via the bluetooth are very clear; also people can clearly hear me as well. Connecting my samsung galaxy note 1 and downloading my phonebook was very easy. The Unit will let you dedicate the speakers of your choices for your incoming calls. Also, you will tell the unit your type of car, speakers, and subwoofers and it will customize a quality sound setting accordingly. If you don't like that feature, you can do a manual setting based on the speakers position to the driver seat. A manual setting could also be done for the EQ ( worth doing it manually) to suit your taste. The unit has three speakers jacks output ( front, rear, sub). The crossover function will let you cut unwanted frequencies at the head unit. The 4 volt preamp sends a strong signal to the amp for a more clean sound.The navigation system is not bad at all, but I still prefer my portable GPS to this one for many reasons. For three times, it took me to a wrong address. The recorded voice gets on my nerve by repeatedly warning we about speed limit. Also, it cannot find some addresses that my 5 years old portable GPS can find.When using a flash drive for music, this unit does a horrible job in arranging your folder. I still do not understand why my folder becomes so messy with it. I cannot easily locate a folder. I have a $59 dollar pioneer HU in my other car and it has no issue finding folders. May be I need to call alpine to figure out about the folders things.The touchscreen to find artist or album is not useful when you have a ton of songs. An alphabetical or a volume knob turning search option would have been more useful and more adequate.I hooked up a rear view camera to it, and the picture is very clear at day/night. I haven't used an ipod yet, but I believe the unit would be able to handle ipod and external video device.Overall, this unit is very good for the price I paid for it ( mine was on sale for $200 below market price).

$REVIEW.: It has been 5 years since I have bought a digital.After WEEKS of research and ALOT of backtracking on reviews, specs etc. I narrowed my options between this and a Canon PowerShot Pro Series S3 IS.Let me begin by saying that for the price, you can not beat this camera.If you want a SUPER awesome camera that is TRUE professional quality, then you HAVE to go with a $800.00 and above SLR.THIS camer however comes pretty close.My ONLY dissapointment is that cameras in this level still do not have flawless crsytal clear images, but as I said, if you want PERFECT you have to get an SLR.As far as choosing between this and the Canon PowerShot Pro Series S3 IS the deal breaker for me was the price. I did not see much of a difference in quality. Perhaps the Canon is slightly better, but in my opinion not so much that I would pay nearly $100.00 more.This camera sports a VERY highly regarded lens and name brand.The ease of features and point and shoot settings are amazing and deliver great photos.As for night pics, it all depends just like every other camera. You want perect, use a tripod. Period.Battery life is very good and speed of shooting is exceptional as well as the zoom and high pixel count.ANOTHER great feature is that there are several attachable lenses you can buy. This camera ALREADY comes with an adaptor and lens hood! Super deal!Really, if you want to spend under $300.00 and have a really nice high quality camera rather than a simple pocket sized point and shoot, DEFINATELY buy this camera!Hope this helps.

 I WANTED TO BE SURE THAT IT WORKED
IT DOES.FINALLY:  FOR THIS TO WORK FOR BOTH SOUND & AUDIO, YOUR VIDEO CARD MUST SEND OUT THE SOUND SIGNAL BETWEEN THE SHORT BURSTS OF THE VIDEO SIGNAL

$REVIEW.: I'm starting to collect MP3 players like some people collect stamps.  I've owned a Grey Whale (256Mb flash player), a Rio Cali 256, a Creative Muvo2 (still), and now this Rave MP.  I've also had MP3 ability with my Handspring Visor (via a Soundsgood module) and two Sony Clies.  Let's just say I'm converted to digital music.I bought this one because the price was super low, a one-time offer at a big box retailer.  They were in and out of stock, but I finally scored mine and here's my take.For the price, it's near-unbeatable.  The LCD screen is extremely readable, not a small feat considering the miniscule two-line display of Creative's Muvo2.  Navigation is quasi-semi-para-intuitive, meaning once you play with it you'll get it.  The nav pad is a standard d-pad with a center push button for activating choices, and it has slightly stamped tactile cues for function (FF, REV, Play/Pause, Stop).  You might need to brush up on your braille to use this in the dark, but you can visibly see the cues as well.First and foremost is sound quality.  It's loud and clear, but not an overwhelming experience.  It decodes WMAs and MP3s (per my own observations) and the LCD display makes good use of showing you song info in a flash... no scrolling, finally.  As a player, it accomplishes the mission.  FM tuning is not going to impress your friends with its DXing aplomb, but it pulls in stations outside 100% and within a building if you give it half a chance to find a signal.Cool features?  Oh yeah:-FM line recording, although I can't imagine getting fourhours of Howard Stern on it;-twenty radio presets;-USB 2.0 connectivity as a removable drive, which makes musicsynchronization fast and simple (use any music manager youwish, including Windows Explorer);-uses a single AAA battery and gets 12-14 hours from analkaline battery (use a rechargable and get about 8-10);-and the reason I bought this, SD/MMC card capability.The last point is worth discussion.  I carry a Jump Drive Trio so I can read Memory Sticks, SD, and MMC cards, but also to carry a 1Gb MMC card with my system essentials and recovery tools.  I have 384Mb free on it even after stuffing WinXP's two service packs on it, so I starting thinking about an MP3 player that would also handle cards.The Rio Cali/ Forge line would have been my first choices, but the Cali is not recognized as a removable drive (you must use Rio s/w to xfer files) and the Forge is expensive (although it is now recognized as a removable drive).  I stumbled upon the Rave MP from a friend who scours the web for deals.  I took a shot and well, this is now my new card reader.  It read my 1Gb MMC card with no problems, and that's my acid test.I'm not crazy about the price point, because it's a little too close to the Rio Forge and Rio sound quality is generally superior to most devices.  However, if you catch this on sale, you absolutely must give it a try.  It's a slickly-designed, sharp little toy that packs a ton of features in a small package.Fred

I had the white ones which are ok, but they do stand out

$review_text.: I am very pleased with the SanDisk clip 8 GB player.  I generally only use the mp3 and FM radio function, so I will limit my comments to these functions.  The FM player is clear and easy to tune.  One can select favorite station presets for easy program channel switching.  This is a very good FM tuner for such a small unit.  I have loaded over 1000 MP3 songs on this device and I am happy with the sounds and convenience of playing my favorites.  I have not been able to figure out how to load the device with songs using Windows Media Player.  It is too cumbersome to use.  Instead, I create my own folders with my favorite songs and then drag and drop these into the device on the computer.  It is much easier than using Windows Media Player.I primarily purchased this device because it was inexpensive compared to any comparable Apple mp3 player.  I am very satisfied with the SanDisk and recommend it to those who don't want to pay over 100 dollars for 8 GB of music storage in a player.Kone

$REVIEW.: Otterbox makes outstanding cases
 This is my third Otterbox (1 Blackberry Curve, 1 iPhone 4, and 1 iPad) case

 I trust that it will provide the best protection compared to other brands
 What really stood out to me on this case was the ease of applying the screen protector

 On my past Otterbox screen protectors - I ended up throwing them away because they were difficult to put on and even more difficult to remove the bubbles
 The Defender Series case for iPad had a very easy to install screen protector that was put on near perfect


 Any "imperfections" were covered by the outline of the plastic case - no bubbles in the screen area!  The case itself is extremely durable, however, it adds significant weight to the overall product


 Be prepared for this slight disappointment, but it's a good balance between protection and weight.Other reviewers critiqued the fact that you have to take off a small back cover in order to charge or sync your iPad


 My port cover comes off with ease when needed and I have had no problems or annoyances with this.The price was also very competitive - most likely because new iPad 2 cases will be coming out shortly, but it was well worth the expense.

$REVIEW.: This is my second Canon point-and-shoot camera, and maybe the 6th one in my family. They have the easiest menu navigation along with a wide variety of features that come in handy when you want to be artsy or stupid.I have my camera set to take the highest quality pictures, which means each one takes up a good amount of space. I bought a big memory card specifically for that reason. The touchscreen obviously has an effect on the battery, but the battery is still great, and this is after 3 years of use. It takes a bit of figuring out to use the camera, but if you hand it to someone to take a picture they shouldn't have too much difficulty just clicking the button.Someone else viewing the pictures is another story. I can't count the number of times my friends would ask to see the picture I just took, then look confused when they see no buttons. This is when I show them the nifty tap to go left/right feature while viewing pictures, and then they all want to just do that instead of look at the pictures.Aside from the gimmicks, this camera takes really great pictures. One gripe I had with my prior camera was I could never tell if the picture was blurry because the screen was so small. This is definitely NOT an issue on the SD3500. The screen is massive, and I love it.

$review_text.: This headset sounds great.  When using for VOIP calls, the person on the other end of the line can hear me very well and I can hear them very well.  I also like the device for music.  Plantronics has a great reputation for high-end audio equipment, so I trust them.The one issue I have (why I took away one star) is the fragility of the headset.  One of the two earpieces keeps popping off of the headband and exposing the fragile red and black wire inside.  If this were to pop off without me being careful, the wires might break or come unsoldered.  Thankfully the earpiece will snap back into place if you position it correctly.

This is good for the 2 or 3 after-shave look.  It is not good for cutting hair that is short either.Packaging could be better--I've never purchased something like this with such bad packaging.Is it just me or does Wahl need to rethink the design of their brushes?  This is the 2nd product that I've purchase of Wahl's and I just thought that the 1st had a defective brush, but then this arrived and I was like &#34;not again&#34;.On the bright side, I don't get razor bumps anymore unless I eat something that I'm allergic to and then shave.Quality feels much better than any of the other cheap clippers that I've purchased in the past.I won't buy another one of these again, but I don't hate it.

$REVIEW.: How to reset if your IPOD Nano 3rg gen lock up.I had my nano 3rd gen plug in the sync cable and happen to reboot my PC.  My PC surprisingly try to do a boot level checkdisk (before Vista/Window kick in).  I wonder what disk it trying to check since it never try to do that before, so I told it to skip the disk check.It turn out that Vista/Window think my nano is a hard disk.  It did something because for next couple hours I could not get the Nano to show up in itune.I did make a "blunk blunk" sound when I plug and unplug the cable, indicating that at driver level the system does recognize but the Nano gone into a "COMMA" when vista/window try to access/checkdisk it as a hard drive.Vista's Manages drive does show it come in and out as Ipod, but Itune and nano just stay in a non responsive comma.After trying everything for couple hour, I tried the reboot sequence:Press and hold the Menu and the "Center buttons" for at least 10 seconds, and the Apple logo appear and the nano is back in business.Therefore do no reboot with Nano 3rg gen plugged in and when it goes in into a "COMMA" reboot it with the "Menu&Center;" combo punch.Buy Apple Stock, no one can make a product this thin and sexy.  It's like buying Windows 3.1 back in 1991.  You'll make 20x your money in 5 years.

$REVIEW.: I got this Zune HD April 21st, and I have played with it extensively and it is awesome! When I opened the Amazon box and pulled out the Zune box, my initial thought was WOW. The packaging is the farthest you can get from flimsy or cheap. You cut the sticker things, and another tray type thing slides out, revealing the Zune HD. Pull out the little case that it's in, and you will find some paperwork consisting of: An ad for the Zune Pass (more on that later), a paper with some features of the Zune, a setup guide, and a users guide. You can go to [...] and find in-depth info on everything you can do with the Zune. Then you will find a fold-open box housing the earphones, sync/charge cable, and foam covers for the earphones. OK, after that little prefix, here's the real deal. I DO NOT write short reviews for this type of thing, so put on some music, grab a soda, maybe pull your La-Z-Boy into your office. One other thing, this is my second MP3 player. My first was a 4 GB Sony Walkman E-436F, which was a good player, but it lacked fun stuff to do. It synced with Windows Media Player, which is what I'll be comparing the Zune 4.0 sofware to. I've also used a 4th gen iPod nano that belongs to a friend, so I can't say anything about iTunes. These two players cannot hold a candle to the prowess of the Zune. They are good players but not of the caliber of the Zune.I'd like to say something about the Zune's competition. There are 5 big-name touchscreen players out there. One, the iPod touch. The touch reigns supreme when it comes to portable media. The original touch that was released in '07 was geared toward that handful of people who wanted an iPhone for the touchscreen and apps, but already had a phone and didn't want to spend all the money for a phone contract. But it was more popular than planned, and now it's top dog in the portable media world. I think the reason the touch is so popular is because Americans aren't concerned with just straightforward music and video. They want a computer in their pocket, and the touch is just that. Two is the Cowon S9. This is more of an audiophile's player, with all the emphasis on media, no internet or games. It also doesn't have as good of a UI as the Zune which I'll be discussing later. Three is the Sony Walkman X. The Zune and the X do a lot of the same things, but the X is $100 more for the amount of storage. Four is the Samsung P3. This one isn't as relatively popular as the previously mentioned players, but is eerily similar to the Cowon S9 in the featureset department.Device Exterior: The exterior of the Zune is, in a word, radical. It's not a screen with a mirror on the back, like the iPod touch. Rather it is a tough- looking device that is definitely worthy of the name "Solid". Let me put this in words. If the touch is a lovely, handcrafted piece from the nice old lady down the street, then the Zune came from a Pittsburgh steel mill. Get the picture? There are only three buttons on the Zune. A power button on the top, which if pressed turns the screen off. Music will continue to play. If you push the power button again, you get a picture of your choosing to slide up and jump into the main menu. On the front face of the Zune is a flat, trapezoidal-shaped button that serves as a shortcut to the main menu, and another option to bring the Zune out of screenlock, a.k.a. sleep mode. On the left side there is what Microsoft is calling the Quickplay button. Basically it brings up the play/pause, skip/search, and volume up and down controls arranged with the play/pause in the middle, skip search on both sides and volume on top and bottom. The controls that this menu brings up are nonexistent on the main playback screen. You can access this menu anywhere on the device, even in sleep mode. There is a lot of controversy over this button, as some wanted a simple volume rocker. I definitely think that MS thought of everything when they made this button the way it is. One, the "pocket-use scenario". The volume can be controlled by a simple up and down motion on the screen when you've pushed this button. A side-swipe to skip tracks works in the same manner. The other thing is, with the Sony Walkman you could only pause on the now playing screen. With this button you can play/pause anytime, anywhere, even in apps. The menu that this button pulls up also lists the artist and name of the song playing. One other thing is that it would have been nice to have an inline remote for play/pause on the earbuds, or at least support for the Apple remote and mic. Back to the exterior of the Zune, the screws are visible on the back, another "Pittsburgh steel mill" feature. The bottom of the front face, directly under the screen, is a plastic lip thing. Above that is the word "zune" or "ZUNE" (I'm not sure which). The back is a brushed metal that will never show a scratch (exactly opposite of the touch). Down at the bottom of the back there is another plastic part that houses the Wi-Fi antenna. The sides have these sort of ridge things, their use, to me, is unknown, other than you could make a case with wing-things to stick in the ridges.Screen: I just had to have a separate section discussing the screen, because it is so good! It is an OLED (organic light emitting diode) screen, advertised as haveing truer blacks and more vibrant colors. The advertisements are absolutely correct! The Zune comes with a little video already on it that adequately displays the horsepower of the NVIDIA Tegra chip combined with the beautiful screen. No pixels are visible, the framerate is great. I haven't downloaded any HD content yet, so I can't comment on that. The screen is also the main control for everything that you do on the Zune. It is incredibly responsive, easily on par with the touch. I haven't tried any of the other players mentioned above, so I can't comment on them. It only takes a very light touch to activate or select something. Some may think that that would be a problem, since you may end up selecting something you didn't mean to, but it really isn't. Occasionally you will push something that you didn't mean to, but not very often. Sometimes the screen is hard to see in sunlight, but that is because of the interface's white print on a black background.User Interface (UI): This is one of the Zune's best features. It looks a little bit similar to the previous Zune models on the main menu, but when you dig in there are a lot of differences. The first thing you will notice is that MS took a bold approach on this interface. It is a black background with white print, which is somewhat hard to see in sunlight, but is really cool. The main menu/home screen has two parts: the traditional main menu and another menu called the Quickplay menu. The traditional (and more main and more used) has all the Zune's functions listed in order of importance: Music, video, pictures, podcasts (if you have any. If you don't, then this menu item is not present), radio, marketplace, internet, social, apps (the same goes for this menu item as podcasts), and settings. The Quickplay menu displays several things: What media (if any) is playing or paused (if there's nothing playing or paused, then this item is not present), your pins, your history, and your newest media. Pins are basically for if you have a ton of media, and you want to be able to access your favorite road trip movie quickly. The pins section will keep that handy. History is the last six things you listened to, watched, played, or viewed. New lists the last ten things you added to the player. I think Microsoft added this with their Zune Pass subscripton service in mind. You'll be downloading so much media; you won't know where to start. The Quickplay menu will help you sort through all that.Now I'll go through each of the main menu items:Music: This is the Zune's biggest strong point. Next to the word music on the main menu, you will see a play icon. This plays all of your music on shuffle. You can hit the word music, and you can dive into all your music. Whenever you go into a menu item, you will see some cutoff and therefore illegible letters at the top of the screen (sometimes these words are cutoff album art). Simply touch that and you will go back. When you go into the music category, you will see under the cutoff word music, selections for artist, album, song, genre, and playlists. These are arranged in a never ending cycle so that you can continually go through either way, left or right. To move from artist to album and so on, simply swipe to the side or touch the word "album" or "genre" etc.I will discuss each of the following categories in detail: Albums, Artists, Genres, Songs, PlaylistsAlbums: This basically shows you all your albums in a grid. It shows 12 albums, I believe, on one screen, you must swipe down to move on in the list. In the number 12 that includes letters at the beginning. For example when I go to albums on my Zune, I see the letter a inside a box, then my album art for all albums starting with the letter a. Then b, c, and so on. These letters appear in every category if you have enough stuff with different first letters. You can touch any letter to bring up a grid of all the letters in the alphabet. Touch a letter to go to it. This is a really efficient way to sort your music, I really like MS's approach here. Some letters will be grayed out, that means you don't have any items starting with that letter. All this category shows is album art, there are the names of the album next to each album, but it is cut off and too small to read. If you touch an album, you get what I call album view. This appears in the artist category and genre category. Once in album view, you can scroll through all your albums, with the album art on the left and a illegible list of songs in the album, as well as the artist name (which is readable). Three albums will fit on the screen at once, which is perfect. In the corner of each album cover there is a play icon. Touching the album art will play the album from the beginning. If you touch the words next to the album art, you get a list of songs in the album, as well as a play icon that will play the album on shuffle, an add icon that will add all songs in the album to the now playing list, and a send icon to send the album to a member of the Social. When you touch the name of a song, you get the same options, except it won't play on shuffle.Artists: This shows all the artists in your collection. There are the letters for quick searching, as well as a play button to play all songs by that artist. When you select an artist, you get their artist page. Your first option will be all their albums that you currently have in your collection, sorted by release year. At the bottom you have the option to view marketplace discography, which is all the music available by that artist in the marketplace. I would have preferred alphabetical sorting instead of yearly sorting, since that's what my Walkman used, but you'll get used to it after a while. The albums are arranged the same as the album view I mentioned earlier, with the release year and tiny songlist. If you touch the letters or the album art, you get the same results as when in the album art category. Swipe to the left and you get a list of songs, sorted alphabetically, in the same way as the all songs category (discussed later). Swipe again to the left, and you have a list of pictures of the artist. Some artists don't have pictures, so you won't see them. Then you a swipe left gets you five artists that are related to the artist you are currently viewing. This is a feature geared toward users of the Zune Pass, because you can touch a related artist, download some of their music and see whether you like it or not. Lastly, another swipe to the left gets you a bio of the artist. I find the bio feature neat, because if you use your Zune Pass to download some songs by an artist you've never heard of, you can see their background and stuff in this bio. Lastly, the aforementioned pictures serve as a background to everything on the artist page.Playlists: This shows all the playlists you have synced to the player, as well as ones you have created on the device. I really like the feature that lets you create playlists on the device. To create a playlist, you go to a music item, and touch and hold it. You will get several options. One is Add To Now Playing. Any media that is currently playing is in the now playing list. For example, if you touched the play button next to an artist, all songs by that artist will be in now playing. Same with an album or genre. When you go into the now playing playlist, there are several icons. Play, which plays the playlist from the beginning. A disk icon, which gives you the option to save the playlist to your player, and a delete icon, which empties now playing. When you save now playing, you are prompted to name it as a playlist. For example, "My Favorite Songs". After that, it will be saved to the player, and will sync to your PC the next time you connect it. The other thing you can do with any song is make a Smart DJ mix. This is an incredibly neat feature, because you can listen to a song, think "This is a neat song. I'd like to hear some more tracks like it." Just hold down your touch on the song, and Smart DJ will pick you a custom batch of songs that go with the one you chose. If you want to save it to playlist, just go to the now playing list and save it. And Smart DJ is quite smart. It will pick songs you never heard before in your own collection, and you'll usually like them. Smart DJ works best if you have a Zune Pass, or a very large music collection. I have about 1600 songs, so it'll end up picking a lot of songs from the same artist as the original song.Songs: Simple enough. You have the letters at the beginning of each letter section. When you select a song, get play, add to now playing, and send options. This is the best way to make your own playlist. Find each song and add it to now playing in the order you want, then save it.Genres: Basically groups music that has the same style of music or lyrics. Rock, Pop, Religious, Soundtracks are a few of the genres on my player. You can play all music in a genre on shuffle by hitting the play button next to the genre. Or you can browse the albums in album view, with the tiny list of songs and artist name on the right, album art on the left.The last thing in the music category is the now playing screen. This is perhaps the most beautiful-looking part of the Zune UI. On the now playing screen you have in the top left of the screen a large back icon. This will take you back to the album, artist or all song category, wherever you played the song from. In the top left is the battery life indicator, wireless reception strength if wireless is on, and whether the current song is playing or paused. You can see those three items also in the play/pause/volume screen. Underneath that you have the name of the artist and album, then the cover art (any cover art looks spectacular on the OLED screen), then a bar showing how much of the song is left and how much has played, as well as number indicating the same things, only with exact figures. Then you have the song name, and in smaller print under that, the next three songs in the album, playlist, etc. If you touch the names of the songs you get a list of all songs in the album, how much time is left in the current song, what position in the list the current is, and the total number of songs. This list will appear only for a few seconds if you don't touch or scroll on the screen. You can touch the cover art to get the volume/play/pause screen. At the very bottom of screen, you have option to shuffle, repeat, and rate the song(s). And lastly in the background you have a picture of the artist of the song you're listening to.And you couldn't have a complete section on music without some comments on the sound quality. In a word the sound quality is FANTASTIC. It is on par with, if not better, the Sony Walkman series, which is cited to be the best, and very easily trumps iPod quality. The stock earbuds are decent, but the cord tangle WAY too easily, more so than iPod stock buds. I ordered along with my Zune someJBuds J3 Micro Atomic In-Ear Earphones with Travel Case (Jet Black) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging] which are fantastic paired with the Zune. The bass is tight, and punchy, but also clear. The mids are clear and vocals sound fantastic (I know I sound like a broken record with the fantastic stuff, but it is really the only word I can think of that describes it). The highs are crisp and sharp, but not overpowering. There is an equalizer with presets, but no user-customizable one. I wish they would have included a customizable 5- or 7-band EQ. It would have given the music experience the title "Most perfectly awesome music experience on the planet". Without the customizable EQ you'd have to take out perfectly from the title. Overall the Zune presents an even sound for any type of music. And for comparison, a buddy of mine has an iPod nano, and we listen to a lot of the same music. I've noticed on his nano that songs I love for the bass, such as hip-hop tracks, sound mediocre. The bass seems very weak while the mids are somewhat overpowering, and the treble just drops off before you can adequately hear the true sound. Overall the entire music experience on the Zune HD is a joy, never boring, all the way from the browsing experience, to the now playing screen, to the insane quality of the sound.Videos: This is the Zune's other big feature. Boasting HD content support, HD output to an HDTV plus the OLED screen, video viewing is a joy. I have yet to download any HD content, so I'll update this when I do. I did download some free Google videos, and they look fantastic, even in standard definition. The Zune sorts videos by category: All, TV, Movies, Music and Other. Each video has a little screenshot of the video, with a play icon to jump right in and start watching. There are also some words on the right that you can touch. Those words are the length of the video, or if it's a music video the artist. When you touch the word you get the year, length, and description of the video. Once you're watching, you can touch the screen to pause, adjust volume, skip to the next or previous chapter, fast-forward and rewind, and change the aspect ration from full screen (4:3) to widescreen (16:9) and back. The colors are true, there is no pixelation, and the experience is overall great.Pictures: This is about the same as any other player, with options to sort by folder, or date. When you choose a category, you get a list of picture folders or dates with a sample (usually the first picture) of whatever is inside the folder and a number indicating the number of pics in each folder, as well as the date of the pictures or the folder name. When you choose a folder you get thumbnails for each photo. Touch one of these to see the pic full screen. You can rotate the Zune to view landscape or portrait, and pinch or double-tap to zoom. When you zoom in, the quality decreases. I wish they would have made it so that you could still see hi-def when you're zoomed in. Maybe pics are too low resolution or something. The Zune comes with 7 pics to serve as backgrounds. This brings into play somethign else about the user interface. Whenever you put the Zune in screenlock mode, the screen goes off. When you press a tactile button, the screen comes back on, revealing a picture with the time and battery life display. You must swipe the picture up and off the screen to use the Zune. In some ways, I like this feature, because you can quickly see the time and battery life. But sometimes it's a pain to have to swipe up everytime you want to quickly change a song or see the title of a song. You can access the volume/etc. screen without swiping up, so that's good. But anyway, you can set any picture, including that of an artist, as your swipe-up pic. When you're viewing a picture, just touch the screen to go back, play a slideshow or set the pic as your background (swipe-up pic). This really isn't a photophile's player (is there such a thing?) but it has basic features to make it usable.Radio: This is perhaps the biggest advertisement you hear about the Zune HD: the HD radio support. Let me make on thign clear. YOu don't get HD reception everywhere. Here in southwest Colorado, I get no HD stations. However I am visiting Albuquerque, New Mexico next week, and there might be some HD staions there. Anyway, it's a basic radio, with the option to set your presets, and manually or automatically scan for strong station signals. You can remove presets easily. The radio presentation is simple enough, you just side-swipe to scan, or move your finger across to manually search for a station. The antenna is your headphone cable, and my four-foot JBuds cable doesn't pick up as strongly as a longer cable would. I am NOT a radio person, I much prefer my own digital files. However, if you live in a bigger city, you could probably get HD programming. Overall a decent radio for what it's worth. I wouldn't get the Zune for the radio, unless you live in a heavily populated area where HD reception would be possible.Marketplace: This is basically Zune's media purchase system on the Zune itself. You must have wireless enabled to download media. You can only download music and apps, whereas the iTunes store on the touch allows you to dowload movies as well. When you touch marketplace on the Zune, you see options for music, apps, and cart. Under music, you can pretty much browse the entire Zune catalog, which is somewhat sparse compared to Amazon's MP3 store. You can listen to samples of a song if you want. I haven't downloaded any msuci from the device, but I did get a couple of apps from it, and the download was a little longer than on a PC. Once again, this is a feature that is geared toward Zune pass subsribers, because you can download whatever you want if you have a Zune Pass. I highly reccomend just sticking with Amazon MP3 because it's all still compatible, and there's a broader selection. One nice thing though is that it will pick music for you that is easily accesible. Just a nice feature if you were to use the on-device marketplace.Social: This is a social networking type of thing where you have your friends, and you can send them music from your Zune. You can choose any album and send it to your friend(s) mailbox and they can buy it, or dowload it directly with a Zune Pass. You can also send messages to friends. This is Facebook type of thing where you must accept someone as a friend to send them something. I don't use the social, I prefer email or Facebook to contact people. A lot of people will like this though, especially if they're into the whole music discovery thing. The other eason I don't use this feature is that I don't know anyone with a Zune! :)Internet: Well, this is the Zune's biggest (and only) crutch. The experience is terrible! The keyboard is incredibly hard to use. Page loading, even when I'm right next to my router, is slow and the signal wavers between good and so-so. You also must change viewing mode to desktop in the settings menu, otherwise it goes to the eyesore mobile versions. I think MS really beaned it on this one. They should have included the Wi-Fi antenna for the marketplace and social and Facebook and Twitter apps, and just skipped the browser. It really takes away from the experience of the Zune if you try to use it.Apps: There are 17 apps as of this review. 12 games and 5 utilities. I downloded some of them and they are quite intruiging. I will list each app, and then write a mini-review of it. A * indicates that an app requires internet access.AudioSurf TiltCalculatorCheckersChessHexicPGR: Ferrari EdtionPianoSpace Battle 2SudokuMSN WeatherAudioSurf is the most fun I've ever had on a mobile device! You pick your own song from your library, and play a Guitar Hero style game where you tilt your Zune to hit colored blocks and avoid speedbumps. You get medals based on your performance, as well as points to unlock new track designs.Calculator: Simple enough. Hold the Zune in portrait for a basic calculator, and rotate it to lanscape for scientific.Checkers: You can play over Wi-Fi against a human opponent, share your Zune with a friend and play against them, or play against the computer. You can choose between four colors of checker pieces.Chess: Quite similar to checkers in features. Gameplay isn't as fluid or intruiging as a good ol' board with plastic or wooden pieces, but it suffices.Hexic: You get a board of hexagonal colors (hence the name) and you must rotate a group of three to combine three or more of the same color. There are three game modes, Marathon, Survival, and Timed. In marathon, you go and go until you break the high score. Whenever you eliminate a group of colors, more fall from the top of the screen. In Survival, pieces aren't replaced, and you go until you have no more moves. Then a star thing comes across the screen and locks up all your remaining pieces. You can no longer rotate them in the next level, but they can be eliminated if you rotate other colors to touch them and clear them from the board. In Timed, you get certain pickup things to extend your time. If you do a fruitless move, you lose time. You go until you're out of time. Not as fun as some of the other games for the Zune.PGR: Ferarri Edition: This game is easily the second best on the device. The download takes forever as it is almost 80 MB. It is a 3D racing game where you race through New York, London, or Tokyo. Each place has four tracks. You select a track, then choose your model of Ferarri, then choose your color. you tilit to steer, with brake and gas on the screen to touch.Piano: A simple piano that you can play with your fingers. You can change the color from blue to rainbow. It's overall a pretty dumb get-up, unless you're a piano freak.Space Battle 2: Like all space shooters, this is a nearly identical copy of Galaga, the classic 80's space shooter. Nothing can come close to the greatness of that classic, so I didn't expect musch and didn't get much. All that's different is the alien ships, and you can customize your ship, and the backgrounds are different.Sudoku: The classic Japanese puzzle. Basically the same as a book or newspaper version, but more colorful.MSN Weather* This is simple weather app, which will give you forcast for a specified town. Just type it in, and you will get weather condition and a five-day forecast.Settings: This menu item gives you option to change anything that can be changed about the player, from wireless on or off to screen brightness to equalizer to keyboard and much more. Come here to tweak your Zune to your liking.One last thing. I'd like to make some reccomendations on what capacity you should get the Zune in. You probably know that MS recenty announced the release of the 64 GB Zune HD, to go with the 32 and 16. I would say:Get the 16 if you aren't planning on a Zune Pass subscription, if you have a smaller media collection, if you are only planning on purchasing a small amount of HD content.Get the 32 if you are planning on a Zune Pass, if you have a larger collection, or you want a fair amount of HD content.Get the 64 if you have a very large collection, if you only are satisfied with HD media, if you already have HD media, or if you're used to using an 80 GB Zune hard drive player.Overall, I love the Zune HD. There are little to no flaws, the biggest being no user-customizable EQ. I will update in the future with info on the Zune 4.0 software, as well as accesories. If you're looking for the premium media experience at a really good price pick this up. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!--Update--Microsoft released some more apps which I downloaded along with the rest of the apps I had not downloaded. I just found out as I'm writing this that MS released two more games, Spades, and Hearts card games. The new apps are:Labyrinth: A fun but challenging game where you tilt your Zune to guide a ball to the exit through a maze.Stopwatch: A simple stopwatch with lap function.Solitaire: This is nearly identical to the classic game on any window OS.The older apps that I had not downloaded when I wrote the previous part of the review are:Vans Sk8: A really intruiging skateboard game, where you tilt your Zune to guide either Bucky Lasek or Omar Hassan in one of two deserted, empty swimming pools. You unlock various boards and wheels, as well as new events when doing the simple timed run event. This replaces PGR as the second best game for the Zune.Texas Hold 'Em: This game replaces AudioSurf as my favorite Zune game. I don't know why, but I'm just infatuated by it. If I don't watch myself, I'll end up playing it for hours.Facebook: I got this app the same day I got a Facebook, and I must say, the iPhone version is quite a bit better, but this one for the Zune can definitely hold its own. I had trouble at first with getting it to display everything in my Newsfeed and on mine and other's walls, but one day it all shaped up and was fine.Lucky Lanes Bowling: Not as fun as some others, but still pretty nice. A fairly simple bowling game. You can pick your lane, character, ball color and weight.Goo Splat: Probably the dumbest game I have ever seen. Enough said.The apps battery life is pretty poor. I would say 4 hours max. More updates to come, so stay tuned!--Update--More apps:Animalgrams: This is a word game where you get the names of different animals, and make other words from the letters. Pretty fun.MusicQuiz: This games takes all your music, a playlist, a genre, or and artist and makes a little 20 question quiz out of it. Sometimes it will play a song and you have to pick the song, or it will show album art and you have to choose one that doesn't belong. Really fun.Also, my Zune now will not connect to my home Wi-Fi network, which is not a big deal, but sometimes I like to get on Facebook without going all the way back to the computer. If anyone has any suggestions on how to fix this, just leave a comment.

$review_text.: This case is made from hardened EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate), a kind of reinforced foam rubber that protects an iPad or Tablet from most common items during transport.  The material does give way to extreme pressure, though as it is not a suitcase but more of a cover that is UVA resistant as well.  For a backpack or message bag, this is ideal.  Just don't place this next to a bag of rocks.This case emits no offensive odors.The iPad/Tablet rests comfortably inside.  An additional soft screen pad inside provides additional protection for the screen.  This pad has four bungee-like rings that wrap around the edges of the iPad/TouchPad.  The fit is nice, but these rings help keep the device from moving around inside the case.The zipper is a 3/4 zipper that easily opens and closes.  The Tablet or iPad comes out effortlessly.My only complaint?  The material seems to attract pethair!  This is obviously something only pet owners like me should be aware of.

$review_text.: This is a very inexpensive lens attachment, and it works as described

 The corners are cut off when zoomed all the way out and there is noticeable distortion around the edges


 When shooting indoors it was fairly obvious that I was using an extra wide lens because everyone knows that the wall doesn't lean over like that

 This is not enough to ruin the shot, but obvious

 When shooting outdoors it is not a problem at all.

$REVIEW.: I replaced my Dell Inspiron 1720 laptop's drive with one of these, and it made it more responsive. The improvement wasn't as drastic as I expected (because I have one of these in my desktop computer, and it is FAST) but it no longer sits there reading the hard drive acting like it's frozen. It also made it MUCH quieter. All my computers are going to get one of these Intel SSDs one day. I already have 3 Intel SSDs. It's like, would you rather be as quick as a hare or as slow as a snail.Why did I choose Intel? I hear and read about too many &#34;horror&#34; stories with some of the other brands, so I figured that I'd just use what's tried and true.

$REVIEW.: Yep, I said it. I used this for my new mini ITX build last year (mid-2013). Windows 8 works great, I honestly like the new interface, especially now that at least some of the settings got their own Metro dialogs rather than constantly using the antiquated Control Panel, and the Start menu is a bit more flexible. If you're open minded to new things (which should knock out about 80% of the people reading this, by my estimation in conversations with people, especially about technology), this is a tough one to turn down. (I got it for about $75, when Win7 was still way over $100.)Gaming actually works pretty well on this; I haven't had any trouble other than similar troubles I ran into using 7; that is to say, running far older games such as NFS Carbon and the like (which were probably mostly console ports to begin with). Without going into too much depth, Win8 runs lighter, has a GLORIOUS task manager, is the future of the Windows ecosystem, and don't forget about that heroic Windows + X menu that you won't be able to live without if you're a tech-head.Have some fun!

$review_text.: I bought this as my first digital camera five months ago, largely on the strength of the Amazon reviews.  I intended to use it for routine snapshots. I can't state how well it stacks up against other digital cameras, of which I know nothing.  But I can say I was surprised by deficiencies it has, when compared against my $100 Olympus 35mm film camera.First, the indoor exposure quality is pretty poor.  Its sensitivity reminds me of ASA 100 speed film.  A flash is always required indoors.  The flash is quite anemic: anything 8 feet or more away will be dark.  In photographing a kids' soccer team two rows deep, the front row was slightly overexposed while the rear was underexposed.  The line was about 3 feet deep total.  There is very little exposure latitude with the flash.Second, I have never seen such red eye in my life!  The flash is about 3/4" from the lens in the same horizontal plane.  I have to spend a couple minutes in Photoshop to clean up every single shot.  I'm used to seeing eyes like this on flash photos of cats, not humans.Third, the battery is tiny, proprietary and very expensive.  This probably explains the weak flash - there's very little power and Nikon needs to preserve it.  Plus, after about 30 seconds idle time, the camera hibernates to save the battery.  One has to press the shutter and wait about 5 seconds for it to revive each time.Fourth, while outdoor exposure has been good, the LED screen is too weakly backlit to view at the beach or ski slope.  And there's no optical viewfinder, so you often can't see what you're photographing in these circumstances.Fifth, one must swivel the lens assembly open in order to use the camera.  When doing this, it's very easy to put a fingerprint over the fixed transparent lens cover.  And a little bit of smudge on that cover gives plenty of artifact on the pictures.Finally, while I shoot at the unit's maximum resolution, it's still not acceptable to press the shutter button and wait two seconds before it takes the shot - and then wait another 3 or 4 seconds for it to be ready for the next. And if the flash is involved, that adds another 2 seconds before the picture is taken. Like I said, I was looking for family snapshots; but far too many pictures have the subject moved out of the frame because of these delays.So, this camera is okay for some things - especially outdoor daylight shots that are not too bright.  But my 35mm performs a lot better in many circumstances.  And its Costco-developed pictures are about 30% the cost of those from a digital camera.  And I don't have to spend hours engineering Photoshop corrections, or burning the images to archival CD.If I had it to do over again, I'd be more fussy about cycle time, battery capacity, flash distance from lens and exposure latitude. Live and learn.

$REVIEW.: With the switch to Intel processors coming in the next few years, I decided on buying the least expensive Apple laptop. For the money, it is a lot of computer.When I got the machine I upgraded the RAM to 512MB, as 256MB does not run OS X well. (I've just heard, by the way, that 512MB is now standard in these computers.) The keyboard is great, and the trackpad is far superior to my old clamshell iBook. My screen is fine with no dead pixels, and I also like the small size of this machine. Smaller screened laptops with slower processors generally get better battery life, and after getting an average of 4.5 hours per battery in my old iBook this has a lot to live up to.I bought an external DVDRW drive for this computer since it doesn't have an internal SuperDrive and am happy I did, as it saved some money and allowed me to get the 12" display. The other accessory I recommend is a Griffin iMic interface. It's a USB device that allows a microphone to be connected. The lack of the microphone jack is my only real complaint here, and they perhaps could have put one in if they had gotten rid of the 56K modem, which is something many users will never use.With enough power for almost anyone, this computer figures to be my primary machine for the next few years, as I will be on the road quite often and will be away from my iMac more frequently than I will see it. Based on the few worksessions I've had with this machine, though, I may not even miss the iMac.

There are no real downfalls to this camera that I've found.  I read about ppl complaining about shutter lag and focusing problems, rest assured, unless you are a tecno/digital camera geek you won't notice anything.  I tried out the Nikon 5200 and others and they take longer and have a hard time in dark rooms.I was slightly surprised that the included CF card filled up after a couple photos.  I was sure glad I bought a 512 mb cf on ebay for $27 to go with the camera.  I also bought ni/mh 2500 aa rechargable batteries and was slightly dissapointed that the charge only lasted me a day and a half of leisurely shooting. but thats why its recommended to get an extra set.I am mostly interested in close-up's.  I own a nursery and sell plants online and I needed something good for macro.  If you have been wondering about this, stop here.  This takes superb close-ups once you learn the easy macro-mode button and practice a little.Overall, all I can say is "wow".  Also the best place to buy right now is beach camera. buy the accessories through ebay though.  I am now 100% outfitted now for $330!Nice work Canon!

$review_text.: First of all, I did not buy it from amazon, I am one of the loyal fans of amazon as to buying great stuff and receiving excellent services from,I purchased this projector directly from Dell.com in Jan


2013, the common focus problems were identified right after the purchase, I thought that I could tolerate the out-of-range focus issue which only happens on the edge of display, essentially I do not want to spend too much time on calling dell
But after several usage (less than 10 times, and less than 20hrs operating), the symptom became worse and worse

The color is just not right (which I did not complain to the DELL CS, I believe that it's the hardware shortage due to the limited physical design-space either from engineering perspective or the manufacture cost ),Okay, The biggest headache is the focus, whatever I'v tried to adjust the focal length, it NOW can't get things nearly right, when center is focused, everything on the edge will be completely vague

 I could not tell clearly what text is no matter how I change the projector distance,another headache is that the projected image is not a perfect rectangle, I tried to tune the angles of the device to which the lens is pointing in all directions, it delivered a "trapezoid" image to me, what a awful product!!Within the warranty, I called the DELL customer service in September, and was told that they can only ship a refurbished unit to me to replace this one, I am very disappointed, and reject the option
I guess that I will just give this one to my relative and seek another one,

$REVIEW.: It works


Transferring files from a computer to the Coby player is easy with the USB cable

Playback sound quality is OK.Navigating the files with the GUI is kind of a hassle, but I usually just hit play and let it go, so it's not really an issue for me.Had some issues with the player shutting down and locking up while still charged - needing to do a hard reset to get it to work again - but these problems have been rare and sporadic.Minus one star for the clunky GUI.Minus one star for the lock-up issues.

$REVIEW.: My first camera was stolen just a few months after purchasing it, so I decided to re-buy the same camera because I loved it so much. It not only looks great, but the size is perfect yet still has a huge screen for clear image viewing. There are more options than I need or find myself using, but they are easy to access and play around with. I use a 2GB SD Memory card and on the highest image quality setting, can still fit several hundred pictures and video on the card. That brings up the video...the video quality is definitely not that of a digital camcorder, but I am very impressed with it. The sound isn't the best quality, but it serves its purpose. I highly recommend this camera!!

$review_text.: If the only thing you cared about in headphones was the sound, these would get a five given the sound you are getting for the price.  However, I never realized there were so many other things to worry about with headphones until I owned these.The headphones never stay in your ear if you are doing anything active.  Running, working out, they are going to come out and distract you.  The cord that wraps around the back of your neck, while sometimes convenient, will also come around and start touching your face, which can be annoying.  They also come with these rubber extensions that always wind up coming off in my bag.  I am the type of person who wraps the headphones around my mp3 player and throws it into my bag - perhaps this is a bit rough, but the wire at the base of the jack ends up coming out after about 8 months of use.Like I said, the sound is great for the price.  Good bass for the size, and outstanding mids and highs.  If you sit completely still while listening to your headphones, these are for you.  If you don't, they are going to annoy you.

$REVIEW.: This kit by AmazonBasics contains a screen protector for the iPad's screen, as well as a cloth to remove blemishes and finger prints before applying the protector and a credit-card sized "squeegee" to help you while applying the protector.Your first task will be to clean the iPad's screen with the included cloth.  Obviously your best bet would be to apply the protector right when you're unboxing your new iPad and before you start using it, but if (like me) you've been using the machine for a while, the cloth will help you clean it up.  I found this the most useful part of the kit, because I was always a bit paranoid about how to clean my screen and this simple soft little cloth works perfectly.After this comes the tricky part.  The instructions on how to apply the screen protector are basic, describe everything you need to do, but don't adequately prepare you for just how tricky it is to get the protector on there correctly and without ending up with air bubbles between iPad and protector. If you've ever tried to apply one of these "skins" to a smaller device like an iPod or phone, you know how difficult it can be.  Multiply this difficulty by a factor of 10 (if not more) because the iPad is so much larger, meaning there's more surface to cover and more opportunity for ripples and bubbles to form.  Just make sure you have a good, clean work surface and can focus on the task for enough time to get the job done, because it can get frustrating.  The fact that the squeegee card is a bit flimsy and small doesn't help at all.  I won't lie and say that I didn't get frustrated!If you really want a protector for your iPad's screen, this isn't a bad choice, but I leave you with this thought: the iPad screen is already quite durable.  It's not like one of those plasticky screens from your 5 year old iPod.  It's a solid, well-made glass-like screen, similar in quality to an iMac's screen.  Your fingernails won't scratch it, and if you use the device as it's meant to be used (i.e. don't tap the screen with a knife or pen etc.) it simply shouldn't scratch. Fingerprints and stains can be cleaned up easily.  It's not like you're going to throw your iPad in your pocket or purse with your keys and phone, as you might do with a smaller device.  Yes, the screen protector reduces glare and fingerprints(somewhat), but in my experience as an average iPad user, a screen protector is frankly not 100% necessary - basically, none of the iPad owners I know use a screen protector and instead use a case for the entire machine.  Even though most cases are more expensive than this $15 kit, you can find decent ones for $40-$50 - and they'll offer much more protection for your money.  Still, if you don't want the added bulk created by most cases and really just want a thin film to cover the screen and nothing else, this isn't a bad choice.

$review_text.: I really love my pocket video camera.  So easy to download into my youtube account.  Easy to splice (edit) with a little practice.  Love it so much I am buying one for my daughter who needs to film longer videos than her phone will allow.  The picture quality is amazing.  The zoom is good.  I've used it several times filming wild animals.  I recommend buying a separate battery charger than what comes with this camera; it didn't last too long.  The batteries it came with are still working with many recharges and it's been over a year.  I thought I would have to have a hard case to carry it in my purse, but it very durable - so not necessary for me.  The pop out USB plug fits oddly into my laptop, forcing me to unplug my laptop fan and mouse, so I am forced to use my laptop mouse while downloading my videos or pictures.  After that, everything goes smoothly.  I have used both moviemaker and Kodak impressions and prefer the moviemaker software - which is free on the internet.

I found this one on Amazon for less than $8 and decided to give it a try since it got pretty good reviews.  The cable works great!  The wire connectors fit nice and tight on the receiver and TV connectors.  I have been using this component cable for about a year and a half now, an it has worked perfectly.  The video looks just as clean as my Monster component cable does.  Would highly recommend it to anyone that needs a component cable at a reasonable price.

What an overraction.If you are using a new printer load its drivers on your computer and make sure it works properly with a direct wired USB cable. Then load the Linksys CD and follow the directions.  I chose to use a static IP address in my routers range.  When asked enter the WPA (or WEP) password enter the same one you use on your router.  That's all there is to it.Total install time was 20 minutes with 10 of that waiting for the software to load.

$REVIEW.: The hot trend in terms of Windows Laptops is Windows 8 and touch screens. The Asus VivoBook X200CA is one such foray into the market, but it is one that is lacking. It is not as much a laptop than it is a touch screen enabled Windows 8 netbook - that class of small, lightweight and unfortunately underpowered machines that emphasize portability and battery life over power. While a fun experiment and a great way to get your feet wet with Windows 8 and a touch screen, the machine comes up lacking for any real regular use.As I am writing this, I am running the machine with the default McAfee security program and Open Office, and I'm currently using 75% of my memory. Part of that is that the system is downloading updates and the included McAfee is scanning it as it downloads but as someone who multi-tasks work, this is going to be a problem. The light memory (only 2 GB) and the beyond weak processor (a Pentium Celeron 1.5 Ghz) prevents this machine from living up to potential. Unfortunately, laptops need a bit more oomph, because unless you leave it on or you use it every day, when you boot the laptop, you need to compete with updates and downloads before you can get started on your work. Which is too bad because otherwise there is a lot of potential here. Sleek and lightweight, the machine weighs in a very light 2.6 lbs. with a bright 11.6 inch touch screen. It is built for portability - there is no optical drive but the machine boasts two USB 2.0 ports on one side and a USB 3.0 port on the other side. Video has both a VGA and an HDMI output on the left hand side to give options to hook up to a larger display. Networking is either the built in 801.11 bgn wireless, but also has a sleek expanding Ethernet port for wired networking if needed. The hard drive is a decent 320 GB, which is probably going to be much more space than you need for this type of machine, unless you use this as a portable movie media device and download a lot of files (since you do not have an included optical drive to watch from)The keyboard is fairly nice to type on featuring a well laid out collection of keys for the size of the keyboard, with the keys the raised Chiclet style that give nicely under the fingers for tactile typing, as well as an on-screen keyboard for touch screen use. At the bottom of the screen is a rather large trackpad that is set up for multi-touch gestures, allowing the user to navigate through programs and the Windows 8 screens with multi-finger gestures. The gestures take some getting used to but overall they can be used for a speedy response without having to move from the keyboard to the screen and back.The warranty and battery life are not bad at one year, and a reported 5 hours of life. Unfortunately, the battery seems to be inside the body which means that it is not easily replaceable, nor is it possible to get a longer lived battery.Unfortunately in the end I have a very hard time getting past the lack of memory and power. I understand that is part of the reason the price is more in line with what we were paying for netbooks, but I have a hard time recommending this machine beyond as either an entry level laptop for year or so, or as a supplemental, very portable machine for on the go. Otherwise, if you are able, up your budget $200 and look for full powered notebooks with AMD or Intel's i3 or i5 line of processors and a decent amount of memory. In the end, you truly get what you pay for.

 This makes reading much less taxing
 I got really old about 3 years ago when I turned 40 and lost my youth-vision...or perhaps my arms shortened?  Either way, I have to blow the font up to jumbo-huge to see it


 Poor lighting, too much glare, anything almost can force me to look uncool and have to put on those old-lady readers


 This item certainly helps
 I am uncool less often anyway


 Perhaps it diminishes the sharpness, as some reviewers have said...but not so much that I can tell

 And believe me, I notice every single day that the sharpness of anything within four feet of me is diminished.I didn't have any real problem installing it

 I have done that a fair number of times with other protectors and this one seemed about the same.

$REVIEW.: We purchased this camera about 2 months ago and have been nothing but pleased with its performance thus far. What you have in this Canon Rebel XT is all of the function, expandability, and speed of your standard SLR teamed with the convenience and flexibility of digital photography with Canon Quality. I don't think you can beat the quality to price ratio on this Camera - it's the sort of investment that we won't be kicking ourselves for 3 years down the road.The Pros:1. As stated, function, expandability, and speed of an SLR built into a digital Camera.2. The camera is built to last for quite some time - it's durable in its construction and the 8MP capability will produce super prints for years to come.3. The battery: The life has been phenomenal so far - I don't think that I've seen the meter drop below "full," while taking photographs, and that's at taking over 400 photos at a time (not all at once though, of course). Plus, it's rechargeable - Kudos to Canon for their forward thinking4. Speed, Speed, Speed. The camera acts just like a 35mm which means that it has a pretty fast processor.5. Cost - a very economical choice considering what you have in this camera.The Cons:1. Expect it to be heavy, because it is.2. There's no built in memory. So buy a compact flash card when you buy this camera as you will need it.3. Related to the above: A good compact flash card is not necessarily "cheap."Altogether, this camera is worth it. Buy a 1GB Compact flash and you'll be able to take more pictures at one time than most will need.[...]

$review_text.: Read the manual, people. Works entirely as advertised with regard to sensing a signal to turn on/off. Unfortunately it requires the proper use of the line inputs which is completely counter-intuitive: LINE 2 is the primary input. Says it in the instructions, says it on the outside of the box for crying out loud. It's a dumb decision by the original design team but if you use LINE 2 for primary input then the signal auto-sensing works perfectly fine.I have this hooked up to AudioSource speakers in my kitchen ceiling and have hooked an Apple Airport Express into it to enable the use of Airplay. Now when I want to hear music or news I just use my iPhone or iPad and have it playing immediately. Brilliant.

$REVIEW.: I have to disagree with another reviewer who did not hear an immediate improvement in the sound between this cartridge and the ATP2 cartridge that is included with the AT-LP120 turntable.I had been buying used records and playing them with the ATP2 cart that was included with my AT-LP120 turntable. I found that some vocals and instruments grated unpleasantly on my ears with that cartridge (is that what audiophiles mean by 'bright'?). It was like my eardrums were vibrating unpleasantly.  I also didn't like the heavy tracking force of that cart.  So, I decided to upgrade.After much online research, I decided to get the AT120E cartridge based on the large number of rave reviews I read on Amazon and elsewhere.I found the improvement in sound using this cart over the other is noteworthy. I am not an audiophile, so I won't go into 'brightness' or 'tight bass' or other catchphrases that audiophiles are so fond of using.  Let's just say the music has more detail, a wider sound stage, and better separation (whoops! maybe I am becoming a bit of an audiophile!).  It simply sounds better overall than the old cart, and the music no longer grates on my ears! But, keep in mind that on a record with scratches or other defects, those defects will be brought out a bit more with this cart than with the less sensitive DJ cart.On several of my records I turned the volume up and listened intently to the innermost tracks.  I hear no inner-groove distortion; the inner tracks sound as beautiful as the other tracks.My music is now more enjoyable; I HEARTILY RECOMMEND THIS CARTRIDGE! In fact, I purchased the 'audiophile grade' record of 'Boston' from Amazon just to hear what my music system is now capable of. WOW! It sounds great with either cartridge, but there is definately an improvement with this AT120E cart.I HAVE FOUND A GOOD USE FOR THAT 'OLD' DJ CART/STYLUS:  If I buy a used record that has a pop or a skip caused by debris in the groove, cleaning the record will sometimes fix the problem, BUT NOT ALWAYS.  Then I put on the DJ cart, dial in the maximum tracking force for that cart (5 grams), and play the selection.  This alone will often dislodge the debris, but if it doesn't I will PLAY THE AFFECTED PART OF THE RECORD BACKWARD using the DJ cart with it's heavy tracking force; after 2 or 3 times, the debris is always dislodged for me. (Do not attempt this with a 'non-DJ' cart/stylus.)A miniature screwdriver, two sizes of mounting screws/washers/nuts, a stylus cleaning brush and instruction sheet are included.NOTE:  Don't take this review as an endorsement of the Audio Technica AT-LP120 turntable, I do NOT endorse that turntable (see my review of it).ADDED 12/1/11...In an effort to squeeze a little more out of this cartridge, I upgraded the stylus to an AT125LC linear contact stylus.  To my surprise, I found that both the original and the new stylus sound ALMOST identical to me!  That is, they both sound beautiful, but the linear contact stylus is a very slight improvement!By the way I see this cartridge is still being sold at a different location on Amazon at the same price as this listing, but with FREE SHIPPING!

The case is hard and strong, but soft to the touch and won't slip out of anywhere

Comes with its own lanyard which I prefer over Apples


Also comes with a screen protector which has a slightly smaller footprint than the IPod and can be installed with the Prefix attached, solving a problem with the other protector.No need to say anymore.Vic Update 6/1


I received a form letter from Otterbox to offer help, BUT their contact form insisted on 2 photos with a ridiculous amount of info, and all my personal info
Since my email to them was to offer $10 check for 3 replacement protectors only, I refused to give more info
Without it I could not answer their question


So, great product, but poor customer service, so star rating drops to a 2.Vic Update 6/2 Whatta you know! My email to them did much more than I thought

Somehow, not too hard, they found my personal info, and 3 protectors are on the way NC by Fed Express
Their persistence over my reluctance speaks volumes about their integrity, hence the return to 5 stars.Your IPad is safe in their hands
And 5 or more stars to Amazon for their mediation in this matter
They don't send out surveys asking us to tell them how they perform

They just go ahead and do it


We're talking about integrity again.Vic

$review_text.: Hi, So I have written precious few reviews at Amazon, and only when I am thoroughly amazed by a product, in both a positive and a negative way. In this case, its the first. Definitely the first. I wont even go into the "1TB capacity in such a small module + USB 3.0 BLAH BLAH BLAH", there are lots of these drives nowadays. I was myself torn between this, A samsung M2 1TB USB3.0 at newegg(100$),LaCie Rikiki Superspeed 1 TB USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive 301952 (Black)for 118$,Buffalo Technology MiniStation Stealth 1 TB USB 3.0 Portable External Hard Drive HD-PCT1TU3/BB (Black)for 112$. Obviously, the A80 was losing, its atleast 20$ more than all the competitive drives. Or so i thought. Because see, I dont go for features, I go by what I need, what would benefit me, something I would pay for. I didnt need military grade protection, since the last 6years, I have ownned 2 Transcend drives(160GB&320GB, rubber casing, very durable, etc), 1 WD Passport 500GB, 1 WD Passport SE 250GB, 1 WD Elements 2TB Desktop HDD and I have never dropped/destroyed any of them. No issues with any of them. So of course, I didnt need to pay for something I would never need.My requirements were:1.1TB2.Good construction, preferably Aluminium(One wants to be a bit safe).3.Cables not coming out,etc-My room-mate has aSeagate FreeAgent GoFlex 1 TB USB 3.0 Ultra-Portable External Hard Drive in Black STAA1000101, and GAWDALMIGHTY, that thing frustrates me to no extent!!!!!!! The cable does not fit in the socket well, and if I move the drive even a bit, the drive gets unmounted from my laptop, data loss, crashing, frustration, swearing, drinking, etc, etc..4. Fast. I will explain this later.5. International Warranty, and good record with it: I am a frequent international traveller, for extended durations. ->V.IMP.So I started out verifying the warranty first: WD has it, Seagate/Samsung has it, Lacie has it, Buffalo doesnt-so out, SP has it.Samsung was plastic(only con), else Samsung was my no.1 choice for a long time(Gr8 price!)The Rikiki had a lot of reviews about the cable coming off, I didnt want to take chances.Anyways, it was either the SP or the Samsung. I took the leap and got the SP-> 28$ over the Samsung, for the "Military Grade protection". i dont know what made me decide, maybe it looked better, I am partial to blue, maybe its the huge number of positive reviews of Silicon Power, maybe its my distrust of Seagate(Samsung's partner, I m negatively partial to Seagate, even though I love Samsung).when it came in(just 1 day delivery, evidently it shipped from just 100 miles from my home lol :P), heres what I found out.1."military grade protection" test- Dropped it twice on the carpet from 5ft, twice on the floor from 4ft(once flat on its face, once in a horizontal trajectory, like falling out of my pocket. Result->Nothing. Zilch. Nada. No dents, scratches, parts flying out,etc. Now here is when I pop in my opinion of the construction. Full aluminium. Rubber seals on both sides. Waterproofed USB3 port, Cable on other side. No give, no bends, smooth pure blue aluminium. God I love how it feels.Anyways, I digress.2. "Waterproof test"- Dropped it in the sink, turned on the water directly over it, waited till it filled up. Took it out, wiped it, opened the USB3 port, popped it in the laptop. worked perfect.Note:Just to spice things up a bit, here I mention that on the second drop, the rubber seal on one side popped out a bit in the middle, I didnt notice it, and did the water test on top of it. It survived. Without a hiccup.3. Speed test:Formatted to NTFS, transferred a 5.5GB file- got 78-98 MBps( The speed is lower on the inner parts of the cylinder). then I benched it on ATTO disc benchmark, a standard benchmark tool. Got 110/110 MBps on sequential read/write.I tested my roomies' Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex 1 TB USB 3.0 Ultra-Portable External Hard Drive in Black STAA1000101, got 77/76(NTFS formatted).So here you see what I mean by my 4th requirement, both are USB3.0, but my drive is almost 50% faster than his. Now I am glad that I didnt get the Samsung(Seagate &lt;wink> :P)I also tested my year old Western Digital My Passport Essential 250 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive (Midnight Black), got 35/33 MBps Read /write- To show what the difference is between USB2 and USB3.4. Package contents/ Ease of use, etc: The package had the drive and a quick start drive, along with a short and a long cable. Pretty standard. I like the additional cable, but i really like the integrated cable, cables can be so easy to lose, break, get chewed on , etc etc...No software included, none needed infact, and i dont like bloat. but from the website, you can download a backup utility called SPWidget (havent tested it out yet, maybe i will sometime) and an utility for password reset when you lock this drive in Windows 7. Both are quite neat, and appear non-intrusive. Meh, I dont need them now.....Anyhow, if you havent got the gist of it till now from my review, its " THIS DRIVE IS AWESOME!"
$review_summary.: Its like a tank, a 110MBps tank.

$REVIEW.: This IP  based Security Cam is completely unreliable

If you are looking for a security camera to record this is NOT the one for you
It will only allow you to record via Internet Explorer (you can view but not record via Chrome or Firefox) and 90% of the time when I put my camera on record, I return home to find it has shut itself off or to find the dreaded &#34;Internet Explorer has failed to respond&#34; message


It seems rather pointless to have a security camera that is not reliable or dependable to record while one is away.Foscam customer service is also very unhelpful and lacking in product knowledge

Part of the reason is they speak very poor English (as witnessed in the user manual) so there is a massive communication barrier

I had to email several times before I finally got a response and the only suggestion I was given was to purchase some pricey software but even then the person admitted it was not a sure fix


Moreover, Foscam is aware of this recording issue but has failed to correct it.Needless to say, if you are looking for a security camera to record footage, do NOT use this one

I highly recommend a closed circuit camera that does not operate via the internet
 With that being said, if you are not interested in a security camera to record (seems counter-productive) then this may be the one for you

If you are truly considering purchasing this camera or any camera from Foscam, I highly recommend you visit their message boards via their Web Site and see all the issues current customers are posting about.

$SUMMARY.: Very unreliable and undependable!!!

$review_text.: I gave this router to my sister and had to spend a couple hours helping her over the phone to set it up. The default address in the on-line owner's manual is 192.168.0.1.  The one in the included manual is 192.168.1.1 with a note that indicates if it does not work to get the address off the box, which was blank. I finally did the "ipconfig" thingy and the actual address was 192.168.1.50. This would definitely cause problems for those with little or limited networking knowledge and is really manufacturer sloppy. And yes, the router was brand new in factory wrapping.

$REVIEW.: The Roku XDS is a very good device with a lot of potential.  I would not cancel my DirecTV - yet - but I think in a year or two, this device or something like it has the potential to take us there.Pros:- Very easy setup; I turned it on, it updated via Internet, no issues- Netflix, Amazon VOD, Hulu are all preinstalled as "channels".  You just have to enter the code in each (beats typing your username and password with the remote) and you're good to go.- Netflix interface is MUCH nicer than both of my Blu-Ray players (Vizio and LG)- No issues at all with streaming and good quality (tested Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, HD and SD)- Interface is not as nice as AppleTV, but it is easy to navigate and works- I like the "Channel" concept. Some interesting channels are there already (free and paid) and hopefully they will add more as time goes onCons:- I worry about the longevity of the box; it looks cheaply made, as does the remote (although I programmed my Harmony 1100, so the remote isn't an issue for me)- Not much content right now; really doesn't do anything more than a mid range Blu-Ray player with Internet capability- Internal wireless antenna is garbage.  I suspect that the people having issues with this box are trying to use the internal wireless.  I have a D-Link Router and a D-Link wireless access point by my TV; when I use the Roku's wireless capability, the streaming quality is very spotty.  When I plug it into my wireless access point, it's flawless.  Both are, of course, the same distance from the router -- but the Access Point maintains a very strong connection, while the antenna in the Roku seems to have some issues.The bottom line, IMHO, is that you buy this box for the potential, not for anything special that it does today.  It is definitely very nice for Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon VOD - and there are a few channels that are nice - but Roku really needs to work with major content providers to get more premium content channels.

$review_text.: Testing the Sonos 1 this evening
 And something is so surprising that it immediately knocked it out of the running for me as a speaker set up to run off my computerOnly audio streamed THROUGH the Sonos software is played through the speaker

 Doing a search on the web, it appears that there is no way for audio on my PC to stream through the Sonos software
 Since the Sonos only allow a limited list of music streaming audio services, there is no way for my PC sound to play through the Sonos

 This is INCREDIBLY limiting


 If one was watching news, or sports, or Youtube through the PC, no audio comes through the speakers.Doing a search on the web, I see that I am not the only one that is extremely surprised by this limitation


 This imitation alone knocks the Sonos system out of consideration for me
This is so amazing to me that I considered giving it two stars but decided that 3 stars would be a bit kinder.This means that if I want a Sonos system for my office, I need Sonos AND another speaker system to play my PC audio as a Sonos user suggested

 And my sons who do a lot of schooling at home will need another speaker to run off their laptops when they do schooling which involves watching some DVDs, and streaming some online instructionals

 This is not a minor inconvenience and added cost.In short, I am not music streaming centric

I am audio centric

 All forms of audio matter coming out of our computers (we run four routinely at home) which happens to include music streaming

 But Sonos is limited to serving only the music streaming component of PC audio


Given that Sonos is a SYSTEM, and users will presumably keep adding expansion units through the years, and investing in the four figures, this is no small limitation in my opinion

 Note the emphasis - in my opinion.Well, 24 hours later, I am knocking one more star off
 I am not being mean spirited, but it really is more limiting than freeing

 I have a Spotify membership and download a lot of music onto my hard drive, and Android phone

 Why?  1

Downloaded is 320kb with zero wait time


 2


Occasionally my internet is slower if other family members are downloading large files, and occasionally internet may even be down

 With Spotify software, one can download as many gigs of music as one desire

 Apparently Sonos is ONLY for live streaming


 So if the internet is down, my paid subscriptions can't play music through Sonos


 I would like to be corrected if I am wrong
Due to having to stream, I sometimes have a moment of delay when pulling in new music.The speaker itself sounds good - not quite as amazing as 20 five stars rating would have me anticipate, but the audio is clear,good bass presence, and is good for a $200 unit.Here are some other pluses on the Sonos 1.1


Very high quality physical design and material

The unit exudes quality


Bravo.2


Does not require a wall wart - the ac adapter is built inside the unit


 HUGE plus, and contributes to some of the weight which gives it a sense of quality.3
Once it is connected, it has been stable


 It did take me three tries to connect the Bridge unit, and then another two to connect the speaker but once connected, stable even when I switch outlets.Some other cons:1


 Need a lot of outlets to have a paired system in a room.I would LOVE to hear two Sonos 1,  along with the sub


 It could make the ultimate desktop and room speaker with extension down to the 24 Hz range

 But that would be a very pricey proposition at $1,100

 Also, for that to work, one needs to have THREE outlets to plug three units plus the bridge into a fourth outlet


 A normally wired speaker with sub system needs only one outlet
 Sonos would need even more outlets if you want a 5.1 movie system.2
No audio input

 The Sonos limitation would not be as bad if the Sonos 1 had a 1/8th input jack as the Sonos 5 does.3

Not a huge con but the Sonos 1 really does scream for a battery operation like the Bose Soundlink Mini and their ilk


 Many other manufacturers achieve that but Sonos does not seem to feel that is appropriate as they may want to have a rock solid stable unit which requires a wall plug.

$SUMMARY.: Can't stream PC audio? And other niggles on a high quality unit.

$REVIEW.: I bought this AVR for a very good price, but not from Amazon.  I was only looking for a way to play HDTV audio through some speakers that I've had for years.  The HK AVR 1700 does this very well.  Finding the AVR 1700 has networking capability, I made a wire connection to my router.  After much trial and error effort I managed to get the AVR 1700 to find and play music from iTunes loaded on my PC. Much of this challenge was on the PC side.  Generally playing music from iTunes is not a fun experience.  The AVR 1700 has limited features for browsing in iTunes.  It is slow to establish connections to the PC and to iTunes.  You have to be very patient and wait for a response.  I seldom log off or restart my PC, letting it sleep most of the time.  It is not uncommon for me to need to reboot my PC to get the AVR 1700 establish a connection to the PC.  I wish I could control iTunes music to be play through the AVR 1700 directly from my PC, but havent't found a way to do that with a network connection.

$REVIEW.: I purchased the Anker 14 watt solar panel charger to be teamed up with my Anker 2nd Gen Astro 3 12000mAh battery.  I am using this to charge my various devices while I am on the road doing backpack camping on a motorcycle.So far I am really loving both of these units.The solar panel allows me to charge the battery even if I do not have access to electricity.  I am able to get some output from it even on sunny days to give a little boost to the battery backup.  I have not charged any devices directly since I have the battery backup.The battery has been amazing and has actually saved me a few times due to poor battery life on the Samsung Galaxy S3.

$REVIEW.: My last gaming keyboard was a Saitek Eclipse, but other than an illuminated keyboard, didn't offer much in the way of gaming functionality.  This is my first Logitech G-series keyboard, and I am very impressed.PROS:- 16 million+ combinations of customizable colors for keyboard illumination- LCD display is customizable, and offers fairly crisp high resolution text- 54 combinations of G-series macro keys- Headphone/mic jack built-into keyboardCONS:- Extra macro keys on left require typing acclimation- Keyboard itself isn't very comfortable for long periods of typing- No USB hub integrated into keyboard- Feet on rear of keyboard are pitiful, barely any elevationIlluminated keyboards might be all the rage now, but the G510 provides a nifty feature by allowing not only preset colors, but enabling the user to create his/her own colors!  That's right, that means a very large number (16 million+) of colors can be created by any combination of values on an RGB map.  I easily created cyan, orange, and light green background illumination colors.  As far as I know, Logitech is the  only company to allow such tremendous customization of illumination colors.The keyboard size is not too large, with the only extra width coming from the addition of the macro keys on the left.  However, the extra macro keys may take some acclimation if you're using this keyboard as your primary typing keyboard.  Not being used to the extra width, I kept hitting the wrong keys.  The LCD mini-display is not adjustable, but it's ideally angled towards the user for easy reading.  The feet on the back of the keyboard are pitiful, as they provide barely any elevation.  Additionally, this is not a very comfortable keyboard for long periods of typing (it's fine for gaming sessions) because the keyboard is too flat.The macro keys are like hardware "binds", which allow the user to perform certain pre-programmed actions.  I programmed mine to call opposing players "nubs", but of course one may personally customize them with Logitech's driver software, which is thankfully provided on a CD in the box.  54 macros is over-kill for me, but perhaps some more serious gamers will find all of them useful.  For macro-binds that are tied to text messages, it would have been helpful had the LCD mini-display been programmed to show the text that I was typing.The LCD display can show a variety of helpful information to the user; I actually preferred the default programs such as the time/date/clock, CPU performance, and media player (shows song being played in WinAmp).  I tried the keyboard out with Bad Company 2, and the LCD mini-display kept vital information such as kill/death ratio, ping, map_name, etc.. easily visible.  I was able to access additional data and statistics by flipping the "page" on the LCD mini-display.CONCLUSION:  An excellently full-featured gaming keyboard.  Heck, I'd buy it just for the customizable background lighting.

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my parents and they love it, with a few tweaks 2D is perfect. I looked at the name brand TVs and the 3d and 2d between the two was not different at all. I think its just like anything else new that comes out, I remember paying 300$ for one of the first blu ray players now there under 100$. If you feel iffy about Vizio don't if anything they are selling a equally good product as sony or LG but at a peoples price. Sure I read a few things here and there but these are nit picks. I haven't heard a complaint from my old folks and they are picky lol. Anyways the apps are cool I set my parents up with my prime. Only thing I suggest is finding this at wal-mart they had same day pick up and took my parents to get it they enjoyed the surprise and it was about 700$ there with my state tax being 7%, it was still cheaper.

$review_text.: I have a Dell 17" laptop, and it's hard to find a good neoprene sleeve that fits these larger laptops.  The handles are helpful.  But I really chose this item because I insist on having a zippered outer pocket to hold some USB cables and a travel mouse.  However, the zippered outer pocket has a zipper that is pulled with a little string rather than a metal clasp, and the zipper is not only hard to pull but also keeps getting stuck.  It's simply a cheapo zipper.  Higher quality zippers would make this sleeve a great one, but with zippers that always get stuck, I'll be returning the product.  Very sad!!

$review_text.: I purchased this battery to have a backup for use in my Canon XF100. The battery works great! As another reviewer has said, it doesn't tell me the actual time remaining (similar to the OEM battery) but that's not an issue for me. You still get a read out with a battery icon, similar to what you'd see on a cell phone.I just used this battery to shoot a wedding and reception, around 4 hrs total. I recorded over two hours of footage, and was on standby when I wasn't shooting. I also reviewed several video clips on the camera to check footage. After all this, the battery was not even down to the half way mark. Without changing the battery, I later went to my parents to record some home video (another 30-45 minutes) and it made it through that as well!Needless to say, the battery is well worth the money- significantly cheaper than the Canon version but performs great so far. I will definitely be ordering more in the future!

$REVIEW.: UPDATE 2: I ended up keeping the TV for a couple more weeks after exchanging it. The second TV had the exact same issue with crashing. LG sent techs who kept the TV for a week and replaced the mainboard. I'm not sure if this fixed the crashing issue as it lead to another issue: the TV could no longer tune to any channels. This was the last straw. I returned the TV two days ago (8/9/2013) and purchased the theSony KDL-50R550A 50-Inch 120Hz 1080p LED HDTV (Black)andSony BDP-S5100 3D Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi.------UPDATE: I have decided to return my 50GA6400 and replace it with theVIZIO M501d-A2R 50-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Smart LED HDTV. Whether it's the fault of LG or Google, this device crashes way too frequently. Today alone it crashed 4 times in one hour. This is simply unacceptable. LG sent someone to replace the mainboard of the first device I purchased; but, it did little to resolve the problem. After exchanging that device for another one at my local store, the second one experienced the same issues. I do NOT recommend anyone purchase this device until LG and Google release an update for the software.------Let me start by stating that this is my first television purchase and I will primarily use this device as a large monitor for Netflix and Amazon Video. I don't have cable/satellite/OTA television service and cannot speak to the quality of that feature. I purchased the 50" model.While I love the hardware and design, excepting the remote, the software leaves a lot to be desired. The first major issue is that the device crashes pretty frequently. While watching a show on Netflix on my Blu-ray player (I'll address Netflix issues later.), the television crashed and restarted itself three times before I could finish the 42 minute episode! I checked the settings and it was only using a third of its allocatable memory. I'm not familiar with Android/Google TV settings so I didn't know what else to check. I eventually gave up and finished the show on my laptop.Why am I using Netflix on my Blu-ray player when the television has a Netflix app? Because TruMotion cannot be disabled for Netflix! I find the name TruMotion rather ironic given that it makes my Netflix videos ("Breaking Bad" in this case) appear to be sped up. I can however disable this "feature" for an HDMI input. It is also worth pointing out that this device does NOT have Simplink/HDMI-CEC, so I still have to use a separate remote control for my Blu-ray player.The "magic" remote seemed pretty cool initially, but I eventually became frustrated with its lack of functionality over time. The red text on the keyboard is very difficult to read and, unless you do a lot of searching, the keyboard itself is pretty much not used. My biggest gripe--which owes more to the software than the hardware--is the fact that the menu button is rather inconsistent depending upon what you are viewing. For example, when viewing TV or an input, I have access to various video and sound settings. If I am using an app such as Netflix, these settings are nowhere to be found.I really want to like this device. I picked it up for a bargain ($899), it has a beautiful design, and, at least on paper, has all the functionality I want--3D, Netflix, Amazon Video. I can work around the TruMotion issue (at the expense of a Blu-ray player [LG Electronics BP530 Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi]); but, frequent crashing is a deal breaker. I will exchange mine for another unit just in case I got a lemon; but, if problems continue to occur, I am done with this line and, perhaps, LG.

$review_text.: I have a few internal disk drives that I am using as external drives and this cable allows me to connect the drive to my laptop's eSATA port.It is pretty much the only one I found with good to excellent reviews and it does work very well. The connections are tight and the construction of the cable is top notch.For my specific application, a 3 foot cable would have been perfect, but none were available so I had to go with this 6 foot cable. It's not a big deal and the excess is just coiled up on my desk. One thing that would have made this cable a bit better (and would have warranted a 5 star review) is if the cable was more flexible. It is extremely stiff and not easy to manipulate to different positions.It's probably perfect for someone who leaves it plugged in all the time, but it can be a pain to deal with if frequently disconnected.

$review_text.: Well as they say, you get what you pay for.  I am a licensed electrician in both Oregon and Washington.  I might know a thing or two about wattage, amps, and voltage.  Let me tell you what I have discovered about this amp.I have 2 subarus, one is a 2005 STI (for pleasure), the other is a daily driven 2005 baja turbo 5 speed.  The STI has a 300x1 rockford fosgate amp pushing a 12" kicker comp vr dvc carbon kevlar woofer in a 1 cubic foot sealed enclosure.  It has a nice bump to it and has been running strong for over 6 years.  This is a true 300 watts being pumped out by the fosgate amp.I recently decided to add a sub to my baja and after reading numerous reviews decided to give this amp a shot.  I figured I would purchase this amp and a rockford fosgate r2d2 dvc 2ohm shallow 10" sub.  I built a .79 cubic foot sealed enclosure for this particular sub.  I have hooked the sub up so that it runs at a 4 ohm load.  This should be greater than or equal to the setup in my STI since the boss website says this amp runs at 700 watts at 4 ohms.  I hate to tell you this but this amp is nowhere close to 700 watts.  Even with the +18db bass boost up and the gain at 3/4 it does not hardly move the 10" sub at all.  The bass is muddy with the +18db bass boost on.  Turning it off yields a very low power level almost as if the sub is not even on.  If I had to guesstimate the wattage being put out at 4 ohms I would speculate 200 watts at the greatest.I am purchasing a second rockford fosgate r2d4 dvc 10" sub.  I am going to run it at 2 ohms and see if this amp improves its performance at all.  The amp appears to be well constructed and would probably push an 8" single sub just fine.  Anything greater than this and you are just asking for too much.  If this amp does not perform even after the sub swap I will be buying a rockford fosgate 300x1 amp to properly push the 10" sub.I, like others, was unable to get the remote level control working.  I tried all of the settings on the amp with the remote control plugged in and it does nothing.So the moral of the story is: You get what you pay for.This was a fun, cheap experiment.UPDATE!!  12/12/2013I purchased a rockford fosgate 10" r2d4 subB005C1R9CETo replace the r2d2 sub.I wired this amp up @ 2ohms.  It is an absolute joke.  With the gain only set at 1/3 and the head unit volume at 1/3 listening to trance music the bass gets distorted and muddy.  I know, I know BOSS is going to come along and say "Hey you have the settings wrong", or "The wiring is wrong".  I hear this a lot from companies that produce a less than quality product.  Great thing is that I have this amp wired with a boss 4 gauge amp kit which is above and beyond what they suggest for wiring.Long story short, this amp would be great for an 8" dvc sub set at 4 ohms and nothing more.I am replacing it with a rockford fosgate TRUE 500 watts mono prime amp.B00BF6HYDENo more cheap stereo stuff for me.
$SUMMARY.: 4 ohms @ 200 watts if you are lucky

$review_text.: I've written in other reviews that I'm always looking for good headphones that I can carry with me at all times. Earbuds sound terrible. In-ear canalphones and canalbuds irritate my ear canals after about 30 minutes. Other lightweight headphones like theSennheiser HD 218fold flat but don't have good sound quality, mainly lacking in bass. Thank goodness JBL finally came out with the Tempo On-Ear.Most important obviously is sound quality. It sounds clear enough to me. Bass is not quite as deep as I'd like, but deep enough and with good punchiness. But then again, I'm a basshead, so I want more than what most people would be quite happy with. No rap or hip hop for me, but to my ears, every kind of music sounds richer with a good amount of bass. I prefer the stronger bass on mySennheiser HD 202, but that isn't really portable since it won't fold flat like this model. I burned in the phones by playing music through them at normal volume for about 48 hours and it seemed to smooth out the sound, taking a little bit of edgy brightness off the treble. There is slight leakage of sound even at moderate volumes, which is surprising considering this is a closed phone. Still, not bad for people around you assuming you don't listen at deafening volume. The Tempo is easy to drive with portable devices. I don't use them at anywhere close to full volume on my iPhone, probably in the neighborhood of only 60% of maximum.I really like the flat-folding aspect of these phones, which lets me carry them in my bag all the time. I've owned other phones that do this before, notably the K 26P and K 518 LE, both from JBL's sister company, AKG. The reason I prefer the JBL design is that the pivots don't rotate freely. They have some friction in them so they hold their position. Picking up the AKG models feels sort of like picking up a wet noodle, the way they just flop around in all sorts of different directions. The AKG phones also had additional hinges that were supposed to make them fold even more compactly, but those just made folding and unfolding the headphones a more involved and complicated process. With the Tempo, pick them up, twist the cups and you're ready to use them in a couple of seconds. Likewise, unlike the free-sliding AKG headbands that needed to be readjusted every time they were unfolded, this headband has a length adjustment with notched detents so it keeps its adjustment between wearings.The look is nice and understated, with a matte black finish on most surfaces and a reddish orange JBL logo. One nice touch is the orange exclamation point on the inside of the left earcup. Makes it very easy to know which side is which without having to look for tiny L and R markings.In terms of comfort, they're not the best I've had. TheSony MDR-XB500with its massive, soft memory foam cushions is hard to beat, but the Tempo is still good. Much better, in fact, than the aforementioned AKG models, which fresh out of the box had high clamping force on the ears. Those needed their headbands bent outward to lessen the pressure. The JBL has moderately strong force but it's still comfortable for a couple of hours. The cushions are covered in a somewhat stiff leatherette, not quite as soft and flexible as I'd like, but maybe that will make them more durable. The earcups are on the small side, but that's to be expected for truly portable supra-aural headphones. The headband also has padding, so I don't even feel it on my scalp.I don't understand the other reviewer who claimed the cord is too short. It's 48 inches long. How much longer would someone want for use with portable music players? Headphone cord managers are already very popular, obviously because most cables are too long and people don't like excess cord dangling around. I'd prefer if it was a little shorter, like 30-36 inches. The cord is slightly on the stiff side, but again, hopefully that adds to the durability. The one thing I wish JBL had done was use a low-profile right-angle plug. Those make damaging stress on the plug and jack much less likely.Kudos to JBL. I've finally found portable headphones that I'm satisfied with.

$REVIEW.: If you get one without instructions for Windows 8.1, do not follow the included instructions

The biometric features in 8.1 are very different from 8.0 and older

All you need to do is plug it in and then search for fingerprint to bring up the fingerprint to bring up the biometric configuration options in 8.1 and program in your finger prints.Because the instructions included in my device did not mention 8.1, I had to request support from the manufacturer

Support was great


Very fast and helpful responses

I highly recommend Zvetco Biometrics.

$REVIEW.: Just got it today. Amazing quality of picture, even when upconverting 1080i. Speakers are on the quiet side, but we are getting the Sonos soundbar which will be fine. Screen is extremely bright in dynamic mode- actually hurt our eyes in the dark. We put in Lord of the Rings, Return of the King and switched to Movie mode and it was just phenomenal. Every beard hair and chink in the armor showed up. We knew there were all sorts of dark, shadowy scenes and wanted to observe whether the TV brought this out as well as the theater. It did! I'd say it was better than the theater.The curve to me added something. But it is subtle and perhaps some would rather save the extra money. I also chose the curve because this set is on a wall in between two windows and I felt the curve away from the windows would help avoid reflected light and even shadow the screen somewhat and it certainly did. Anyway, this screen was easily bright enough even with broad daylight right outside- a dramatic difference from our older set.I am not a techie, so I'll defer to others. However, we couldn't be happier after replacing our 65&#34; 4yr old samsung with this.
$SUMMARY.: Believe the hype- this set is the real deal and will only get better when you use an upscaling 4k bluray and get 4k Blurays

We gave him this pillow speaker, and a very small, easy to work mp3 player (Sansa Clip) and filled the thing with his favorite music.

$REVIEW.: Works well, no cables needed, but a cable and a plug in power adapter are included for charging.  Not super loud, but you should not be getting something like this if you want to blast music anyway.  Sounds good, bluetooth connection is easy. I am using it with an Ipod touch and an Ipad.  I just wanted something louder than the built in speaker in each, and this fits the bill and sounds pretty good.  I have not used the speaker phone function.If you want to listen to audio without ear buds, it sounds good, and lasts many hours on a single charge.  I got a good deal for one here on Amazon, at the time it was $65 incl shipping from a 3rd party.  Perfect for the road warrior to toss into a suit case.The one thing I don't really care for is the glossy finish on the top, I think it will be prone to scratching, and they did not include a case.  This is nitpicking.  I am very happy I invested in this product.

$REVIEW.: I bought this lens because it was extremely cheap and looked like it would work for a set of macro shots.  It is definitely a sharp lens and the shots ended up coming out great.  you can literally touch the object(in this case it was a ring) with the lens, and it gets it in focus.  This would be good for some smaller gigs, and to experiment with macro photography.  It would be nicer to not have to be so close to the object, but for that kind of luxury the 100mm L canon lens is the only other one that provides such a nice picture quality that I've found, but it costs double the price of this lens.  The construction in this lens is solid it feels very good in the hand and has some weight to it.  The only thing that doesn't sound very good is the autofocus motor, but I don't use that so it was not an issue for me at all.

Perhaps I was on a non-starter as I have the WAG54G which isn't on the very short list of linksys kit that the box says it "also works with".  Additionally the box says "works with most routers", which you'd think included most of Linksys' own routers.  Not, apparently the WAG54G.  If you have the WAG54G, don't buy this thing, you will have no joy.  It will simply stop your network functioning and if you do plug it in via ethernet to your WAG54G it will cripple it with IP conflicts.  So don't buy it.  Move, it's easier.

My previous headphones were Logitech.  They cost more and were not as good as this one.  The directions are in Chinese I believe.  Just insert the disc driver, select your Operating System (mouse over folders to see what is what) and install the drive.  Once you do everything is in english and you can customize your EQ and what not.  I use mine for gaming and listening to music.  I am really happy with these headphones.

$review_text.: First, I bought this to have text-to-speech and bluetooth in the same box. All I really want it to do is read books to me without a cable. Honestly, it mostly works. So far I've had to wipe and reinstall three times since I bought it to keep the bluetooth functionality working. THAT IS A ROYAL PAIN! But mostly it works. I have to re-pair the headphones and kindle more often than my ipad, but it does work. So for what I bought it for I'd give it three stars, it mostly works. If there was a quick fix to get the bluetooth working again I'd give it four, because de-registering/re-registering is such a pain it's loses a star.That said, I have an ipad mini and the idea that this device is in the same class as that is a joke. If you bought one expecting apple like performance the joke is on you. The IU is clumsy, and lacking. I keep looking for the there, 'cause there is no there there. The browsing response is veerryyy slllowww compared to the ipad. The available apps are not as well designed and when I can find one that run on both it is always slower on the kindle. Netflix is so slow it's almost unusable. This is on the same wifi that the ipad zips along lest you blame the connection. It just feels like a toy compared to the ipad and I guess considering the price difference that's not unexpected. Really if the bluetooth would just work reliably I would probebly be very happy with it. I am happy with it when it works.I also had a Samsung Galaxy which is in the same preformance class as the ipad, again that tablet was much much faster than this and did not feel like a toy. This is more a supped up kindle than a cheap tablet. Just so you know...

$review_text.: These are the best 16 GB drives I've tried so far on Amazon. They have all been at least 14.9 GB binary, and most are over 15 GB. Write speeds are consistently good, for flash memory - you need to remember that these are NOT speed demons. If you have 10 GB of data to add to a drive, you'll need to expect it to take a few minutes.I see quite a few complaints by reviewers here and elsewhere about data capacity. Most complaints are due to the fact that most computers report capacity in BINARY values, and manufacturers report capacity using DECIMAL values.

$REVIEW.: Overall this is a similar package to the Paintshop Pro Ultimate but with less included items.  Less costly and so more inviting for those who are on a tight budget.I've been using IRfanview for a long time to do my basic photo editing.  However, once I stepped up to a DSLR camera, I wanted something much more powerful to do the job.  A long while back I had use photoshop and was quite proficient.  But I remember a very steep learning curve and a software package that was expensive.  This Paintshop program really cleans up photos that I take to a higher level and it's really easy to learn how to do all the functions.  Runs well and does not crash.  Highly recommend it for the price in consideration.

$REVIEW.: (see my latest update at bottom)We purchased this unit to try out on vacation at a beach house rental where typically we have to connect to neighborhood hot spots. At best we usually have to manipulate our laptop to just the right position to find a sporadic at best connection (you know-- we're ultimately standing on our head, wearing a foil helmet, and holding the laptop on edge etc-- that kind of thing).I'll have to report back to you from the beach house next week but right now I just pulled it out of the box in our urban neighborhood setting at home. We typically have an abundance of signals here but only 1 or 2 have been connectable using my Netgear Rangemax 240 (which does better than my other standard b/g wireless adapter cards).The Hi-Gain picks up a ton of signals in each direction I point it and is able to connect to nearly anything with a signal strength of 20% or better.The Quick Start guide warns you all over the place to be gentle when moving the antenna on its axis or swivel, so comments from others on fragility seem to be correct. It looks like for travel purposes you'll need to keep it packaged in its box (6"x8"x4")But I'd have to say-- so far so good. I have no immediate criticism or disappointment, other than the Wireless LAN Utility has a somewhat undersized window showing available network info--but this is a small issue.I'll report back from the beach house next week to share what our final verdict is.Oh the USB cord is no more than 6 feet long so you will need an extension or a longer USB cord (I ordered a 10' extension for $8). By the way, if you intend to replace the USB cord rather than use an extension, it uses a mini-USB connector (the type you see on cameras and camcorders-- your standard connector as you see on printer will not work.-----------------------------------------------AUGUST 4TH BEACH HOUSE UPDATEAs promised, here is a bit more after a week of trying it out.  The good news is it does consistently work. The ability to move the dish around to locate the best signal is a big plus when you are in some remote area. I am currently connected solidly to a site about 1/2 mile away across a Bay (I have a clear line of sight) with 2 of 5 signal strength bars illuminated.We just repeated a download speed test and confirmed the wireless connection at 4861kbs down and about 420kbs up.To be honest though, I'd say the HWU8DD appears only slightly more sensitive than my current pcmcia adapter, a Netgear Rangemax 240 (WPNT511). Again the advantage here is the ability to move the dish to the best reception spot rather than manipulate the computer itself.Again, the short length of the USB cord (about 5') means in most cases you really need an extension, but with the 10' USB passive extension we also purchased from Amazon, I'm able to sit where I want to and let the antenna do its work. The bad news is I have a cord draped across the floor which may drive my wife a bit nuts at times.We also discovered this is not compatible with my wife or daughter's Mac (also not compatible with Linux.)  I just checked the Hawking website that tells me only Windows Vista 32, XP, 2000, Me, and 98Se are supported with drivers.Finally, I also have to agree with those who note both size and fragility again.  For traveling "road warriors", this is a relatively bulky, and somewhat cheaply made little plastic unit to be taking along on your flights or packed in a car somewhere unless you are desperate.  I can see it being totally destroyed in my luggage at the airport, so we won't be taking it along flying to Chicago next week. (Isn't it possible to create a flatter, more compact and durable unit these days?)Who is this perfect for?I'd say the RV'er is going to love it. It's great even here at the beach house where we're not worrying about little people playing with or tripping over the cord. At home, I'd hate to be carrying this little thing everywhere my laptop goes, though with a stationary computer, it may be a good solution.If you've tried everything else, I'd definitely give this a test-drive, but keep in mind the need for a good return policy if you don't like it or if it doesn't work for you.I'm giving it 4 stars because it does work as promised.---------------------Sept 19, 2007 Update:  STOPPED WORKINGAs mentioned in my review, the dish is somewhat fragile. Yesterday we noticed it quit functioning. Perhaps the box was jostled a bit too much, or the dish popped off its stand once too often (the dish connector pops out of its base sometimes leaving the connecting wire exposed or potentially vulnerable to breaking its solders).I looked on the Hawking website and am going to try to return it to the manufacturer if I can.  I am past the 30 day Amazon return period.No bitterness, but just a little bit of frustration. Drop my rating to 2 stars.

$REVIEW.: Cliff Notes:  Camera stopped working after 1 snorkeling excursion

Picture quality is OK, underwater was neat, but now we have a useless camera.Long version:We bought this camera to take on our first cruise to the Caribbean
I have been an avid "prosumer" of a Nikon D90 for about a year and a half, so while I'm no expert, I think I have a fairly reasonable understanding


I'm also think I can fairly label myself as technically savvy.None of this really mattered with the Optio W90
We treated it like our 4 year old Canon Elph - keep it in a safe place, don't drop it, treat it like a piece of expensive and fragile camera
For that, the Optio W90 worked fine - the pictures weren't stunning, 12 megapixels is ridiculously high for this model and adds absolutely nothing to the quality (probably makes it worse...) and low-light performance was expectedly terrible.Fine - that's what the D90 is for and I absolutely take no issues with the Optio W90 on that part

We had 1 day in St Maarten on a snorkeling tour which lasted no more than 8 hours

For that time, we did take some fun pictures of fish, corral and each other on the dock


The camera actually performed flawlessly and we got some neat pictures both underwater and ON the water
Total time spent in the water throughout the ENTIRE (8 hour) day was maybe 2 hours max

When we were in the water, we were careful to hold it above our heads when we weren't actively shooting (to allow it to "rest" from being submerged.) We'd go out for about a 15-30 minute swim at a clip, then come back on the dry dock for about 2 hours or so because we were just taking it easy, then go back in the water for another 15-30 minutes

When we got back to the ship, we rinsed the camera thoroughly with fresh water, as instructed by the manual, and let it soak for about 3 minutes fully submerged

We then let it dry overnight and all seemed fine.The following day, everything STILL seemed fine! We got off the ship in Saint Thomas, we boarded a boat, I snapped a few shots of the passing scenery and all was STILL fine
About 30 minutes after we got to our destination, I went to snap a panoramic pic and the Optio's shutter button appeared to be electronically stuck


I say electronically because the button still felt normal, but the moment I powered on the camera, it would snap 2 pictures all by itself, then quit responding to any user input


Thinking it had some sand or something stuck in it, once we got back to the ship in the evening, we again doused it in clean, fresh water for about 5 minutes (fully submerged in the sink.) Now the shutter button does not function at all, but all the other buttons work

Awesome.Bottom line: I was skeptical about the "toughness" of this little camera


I don't know if it can be frozen, I don't know if it can be dropped, I don't know if it can be buried in mud, but I am NOT convinced it can do any of these things more than once as being submerged in ocean water for about 2 hours over the course of 8 hours apparently killed the most important button.Probably should have bought the Canon like everybody else
While I'm sure we can get the Optio W90 replaced, this experience and arguably crappy dry-land quality (compared to our 4 year old, 7 megapixel elph) makes me wish we went with the Canon.Edit: 8/4/2010 - Almost a month to do the day after sending the camera back to Pentax for warranty repair, I contacted to support to check on the status and they informed me it should be arriving tomorrow (UPS tracking# confirms it.) I asked what the problem was and the tech said he wasn't sure but that anything could cause the seal to leak (which lead me to believe there was a leaking issue of some sort) but was quick to point out that it might not have been our fault that things like temperature etc

can cause it to happen


That doesn't quite jive with the intro on the Pentax website seeming to demonstrate this camera surviving all sorts of abuse.

I noticed immediate results - my CPU stays cool and my GPU (the biggest improvement) is a good 10c cooler! I am glad I bought this, and I will definitely buy this again.
$SUMMARY.: My first attempt at CPU/GPU installation

$REVIEW.: When I was originally contacted requesting that I consider reviewing this product, I was ready to turn it down. My computer laptop does not have bluetooth, and all I have is an iPad to test it on. Not compatible.However, I later discovered that it has a dongle included that will permit it to work with my laptop - providing its own wifi, so I agreed to accept a sample to test and review.First of all, the picture gives you a pretty good indication of the size - small. It will easily fit in with your stuff.It has a good Quick guide which will provide you with all of the information you need.To connect it to my computer, I charged it, plugged in the dongle, and turned it on. It instantly connected without issues.While the touchpad is small, it works effectively.It worked to open, type, and manipulate my Power Point Presentation - which is one reason why I wanted to test it with my computer. Having the laser pointer in the keyboard allows me one less thing to carry when I am doing presentations.Still, while you CAN type with it, the keys are a bit small for my fingers. It is better than typing on my iPhone, but not nearly as nice as a full keyboard.I probably wouldn't buy this to replace a remote mouse, but I was able to fully test it and found nothing to keep me from recommending it to those using smaller devices which need an external keyboard.Five Stars ... it does exactly what it says it does without making my hair turn any grayer than it already is.Again, I tested a sample sent to me for my review.

$review_text.: I decided to get some extras for my tablet so I could have some for my pc and for charging

I noticed after a week of use that the end that connects to the tablet is loose so you have to keep the cord stable so that it doesn't pull back the male connector, which results in the connector not making a successful &#34;click&#34;

I have thought of coating the housing of the part that connects to the tablet with super glue so it doesn't move


Otherwise you see the connector move back and forth
Not good.

$REVIEW.: This board goes fine with newer "Trinity" line of APU's from AMD. I own a computer repair business, and this works great for a value oriented system. It has loads of SATA ports, and you can put up to 32GB of RAM on it. I always update the BIOS, if the board didn't ship with the latest version. This one shipped with F1 so I used the handy "Q-flash" feature in BIOS to update it to F2. Another nice thing about this board is that it has two BIOS chips, so if you have problems with BIOS, you can switch to the backup and restore your board. The board seemed very stable after a 24 hr burn in. I don't know anything about the overclocking abilities, but if you want to do that (make sure you get the "K" designation APU's), I'd look to a different board. This one really is a budget oriented board. Go for a more expensive board that has the higher end VRM/Power Phase design with heat sinks over the assembly.Pros: Great for the price. Seems to be very stable. Plenty of connectivity still for an MATX form factor board. 4 DIMM slots is very nice. You can run Crossfire if easily if you want a budget gaming system with the AMD APU's. Great BIOS UEFI!Cons: I don't like how close the RAM slots are to the CPU socket. Using the Cooler Master HYPER EVO 212 means you have the fan for it hanging over the memory slots. Which basically means clearance issues. But, you are fine if you stick to using the white colored memory slots. If you use the blue ones, you would have to put the RAM in first, then pray that your cooler fan will fit over the last blue memory slot there. I also do not like the placement of the fan headers. I have found it inconvenient for wire management purposes.Over all, a great board for the price. Gigabyte seems to be putting out more stable products than not these days, and the BIOS updating is a piece of cake!
$SUMMARY.: Great budget AMD FM2 board!

$REVIEW.: I used two of these for wall mounting dual 24&#34; ASUS LED backlit LCD monitors in an over-under layout. Because they tilt, I can have the top monitor angled down slightly and have the bottom bezel BEHND the lower monitor. They came with everything needed - screws for the back of the monitor, and also screws and plastic anchors for the drywall. However, I used my own drywall anchors and screws - the ones that come with it are HUGE and could hold a 747 to your wall. As my monitors are relatively small and light, I didn't the 33 Lbs. of rated strength - my monitor weighs more like 3 Lbs. So if you don't want to put giant holes in your wall (rentals, rearranging the room later, etc) I reccommend a quick trip to the hardware store for smaller hardware. I also never put the top screw in to hold the two plates together. If you are mounting in an RV or public place (somewhere the screen could get bumped) I would put it in, but this way, I can pull the screens off the wall if I want to, and they stay in place just fine. Other than that, I love these mounts.

$review_text.: I have a leather cover for my little Sandisk MP3, both bought here at amazon.com, and decided, based on that useful design that I wanted to give this leather cover a try for my iPod touch 4th Gen. Because of the cover (necessary, I think) I find it a little more cumbersome, but all in all, quite useful. I have just one complaint, and it seems minor, but can be a bit frustrating at times. The bottom straps I would prefer to be wider, for better survivability, but but also spaced just a tad wider apart, for easier synch cable connection. Right now it is a bit of a struggle to get the cable in there, with the straps wanting to interfere. I consider them the weakest part of an overall pleasing and well thought-out design (and maybe the designers had some built-in obsolescence idea in mind with those straps). Hope the next iteration will be even better.

 It is easy to use; however I did create a one page cheat sheet for him

 This devise will record and save hundreds of visits and has four folders; each with room for many files
 The number of recording time depends on the quality you select - the directions explains this in a easy read guide


 Of course you can always erase files after you no longer need them and make room for more recordings

By the way, this recorder is compact, just big enough for old eyes to read and use all the displays and buttons, but small enough to fit in his shirt pocket with wiggle room.

This is glossy and reflects light. It fingerprints like crazy. The cloth that comes with it works great on the prints, just keep it tucked into your pad's case.On the bright side I love the cloth and smoothing tool.

$REVIEW.: The good:  It doesn't distort or darken the screen.The bad:  It doesn't fit perfectly.Even though this screen protector says it is for the new iPad, it really misses the perfect fit of a screen protector much like this one, that I used on my first iPad.  The product itself, seems to be a lot like the original version of this type protector, but the material is much thinner and i don't think iPad 2 accessories are completely compatible with the new iPad, because it is not perfectly aligned with the dimensions of the tablet.While I'm unhappy with the fit and finish of the "GreatShield EZseal Plus", I'll leave it on until I find a protector that is really cut to the true size and shape of the new iPad.

$REVIEW.: This review is for the 256 GB variant. It is large, both in capacity and also physically. While the capacity is nice, the physical size is undesirable, and so I can only give it 4/5 stars. As of April 2014, this is the fastest advertised 256 GB USB 3.0 flash drive that I could find. I haven't benchmarked it with a USB 3 interface, but the performance is acceptable enough for me.It works fine on both Windows and Mac OS X.The size and the price both need to come down. What is also silly is that the cover can be easily lost. If not for the speed, other Corsair models would've been much more preferable.

$REVIEW.: ...this Olympus Tough TG-2 camera was a recent purchase on Amazon and this review is from a legitimate Amazon customer

Let me begin by saying that I'm not a professional photographer, but an enthusiast
I have many cameras that were purchased here on Amazon over the last couple of years


(Nikon D5100 and several lenses; Canon G12; Lumix LX-7; Olympus Tough TG-2


These cameras were purchased after many diligent hours of research based on reviews and comparisons found on the internet, as well as the few times I could actually see and feel the cameras in brick and mortor stores around Baltimore, Washington DC and Annapolis...

let me say from the start and say that the TG-2 is a great little camera, and thus far, I have only used it for 2 days in my local pool


I have made several videos and took about 25 snaps

The camera has proved itself so far, though I have reservations about the video portions of the camera that were wavy and had some issues on playback on the camera and on my laptop

I will update this review in the next few months.My main decision for choosing this camera over the competition was the many years Olympus has in making it's waterproof/ weather-resistant cameras and the various first-person reviews I had read


Granted, it's not as guaranteed waterproof as my deep-diving or snorkeling camera combination, (Canon Elph 310HS $200 / Ikelite 6243.31 Underwater Camera Housing $250) but for a small camera with decent features it will serve me well.Feel free to send me your questions through Amazon.** UPDATE - Sept 2nd 2013 **..this has proved to be an excellent little camera in and out of bad weather


I have used it primarily at the pool this summer taking some excellent shots of my grand daughter and her friends

For land use the camera takes excellent snaps and is now my carry-everywhere camera


If you are inventative enough and like to play as I do you will enjoy the ART scenes portion, that take some very different snaps...


and just to make sure I could keep the lens from getting scratched I recently purchased the Rainbowimaging 40.5mm Conversion Lens Adapter, a Fotodiox 40.5mm Snap-on Lens Cap and the Vivitar Series 3-Piece Multi-Coated HD Pro Filter Set

(this set has a UV filter, a CPL circular polarizing filter and a ND 8 neutral density filter
 Total cost was about $27.00

This set-up now gives me the security of keeping the UV filter on the camera when I'm not shooting underwater and then I can add the CPL or the ND8 on front of the UV filter when shooting pictures at the beach
(Just remember to remove all of the filters before shooting underwater, as I don't think they are water-sealed and water may enter the threaded area and get trapped between them and the camera lens.)..so far the only issue I have had with the TG-2 is the lens adapter cover rings that are suppilied with the camera

They do come off very easily
Many people have mentioned losing them on shootings
(I had one come off the camera myself oneday


Now Olympus gives you a black and a red as spares, so keep an eye out when using them on this camera, as they are not on very tight


(I will mention that the RainbowImaging conversion adapter is a VERY snug connection and this will not fall off as easily)



$SUMMARY.: ..a very Tough TG-2

$REVIEW.: I owned several cameras, film and digital, and this is by far the best digital point-and-shoot I ever had. I have to admit that it took me a long time to decide on buying a Casio as opposed to Cannon, Nikon, or Pentax, as I had very good experience with those.However my wife was supposed to be the main user of this new camera, so when she saw it in a store, she was sold on it, as the camera is very small and very good looking. She loved the green one (which is actually a greenish yellow) so we paid $10 more than the black one and got it.To me it took a lot more to be convinced, so here is my point of view on it:Pros:- Very good quality of the pictures (the auto focus works great and the multi point metering system takes care nicely of most situations, including some more difficult shots (like high contrast, back lit subjects, moving subjects, etc)- I love that you can easily switch between standard format (1.33 ratio), film format (3:2 ratio), or wide screen (16:9 format).- Metal body, makes the camera fill solid and you can have a good grip and stability.- Easy to switch between different menus like changing formats, flash modes, ISO sensitivity, different self timer settings, shooting modes (like single, continuous, etc), auto shutter, and face recognition modes.- Although I consider face recognition a gimmick and I never use it in real life, I did try it and surprisingly works very well! Not only the camera will find and focus on the face, but you can set also the Auto-Shutter to take the picture only when the subject smiles. There is even more: you can record several faces in the camera's internal memory, and when those people are in a larger group, the camera will find their faces and focus on them, so they come out the best! I tried the freakish feature and it works!!!Also, it has other many Auto-Shooting features, that some people might want, I tried them, they work but, I don't normally need most of them.- The movie recording quality is very good. I set it to wide screen and the highest quality and it is exceptionally good, I say at least like a DVD (also it does record sound very well, with no significant camera's own noise).- It has its own movie recording button, so you do not need to go though any settings in order to start filming. You push the trigger on top, you take pictures, or if you push the trigger on the back side, you are filming (push again to stop). It can not get any simpler or faster.- If you don't like to mingle with settings, you may find the "Best Shot" setting very simple and useful. You click the "BS" button (funny name... ;-), and you get a bunch of sample photos. Use the left-right-up-down buttons to navigate to the picture that is similar to what you are shooting, push OK, and the camera sets itself up for that type of picture (like flowers, portrait, self portrait, sports, night scenes etc, etc).- I love the burst shooting mode (aka CS - Continuous Shooting), which has several settings:CS - shoots pictures at the quality you set as fast as possible;CS-FAST shoots lower resolution pictures and saves them to the internal memory. I got about 4 to 5 pictures per second in this mode, and the quality is good enough to print 5x7" pictures. This is a life saver when your kid shakes hands with the principal of the school, when they make a karate jump, or when they throw that ball. Normally you push the trigger and hope the camera takes the picture at the right time. With this, you push the trigger a little earlier, hold it until the kid is through, and before you know it you have a series of pictures taken at short intervals of each other, so your chances are a lot better to find one that shows what you want to see.- Used with a 4GB SDHC memory card, my wife took literary hundreds of pictures and filmed many minutes of movie during a recent trip before she had to transfer them to the computer. She did that only several times during the 3 weeks trip.- Also, one charge of the battery lasted for several days. In fact she did not charge it until, into the four or fifth day of the trip, the low battery message came on.Negatives:None so important to give anything lower than a five star rating.- I would have liked a "shorter" focal length on the close end, so that you can have a wider view as sometimes there is not enough room to get away from larger groups of people. However most of the cameras have this focal lengths, so this is just a wish with small point and shoot cameras.All being said, I love this little camera.

$REVIEW.: All I can say after trying these out and switching back and forth between my other various earbuds is "Wow!" The bass sounds so much fuller and deeper. Each note sounds incredibly precise. Prior to getting the Pioneer SE-CLX50's the only way I could get sound this quality was much over-the-ear Bose headphones.These look quite a bit different than any other earbuds I've seen which seems to account for the varied responses by reviewers including the problems with the buds not fitting in some ears. I had absolutely no problem with the fit. Four different size of canal pieces are shipped with the earbuds. These earbud headphones are larger than others I've seen due to the size needed for the speaker driver that delivers quality sound over a wide range of frequencies.The noise isolation is high quality as well. In fact, just prior to writing this review, apparently my wife was yelling at me from the other room and I had no idea.These are now my portable headphones/earbuds of choice. Very nice. I highly recommend these, with the caveat that you may need to return them if you can't get them to fit in your ear due to the driver design.

$REVIEW.: Wow! What a sleek looking machine this is. It's a thing of beauty with the machined aluminum lid and the carbon fiber base which keeps it cool and lightweight at 6 pounds. I also like that the screen is made of Corning Gorilla glass, since my nickname is "Grace."The 15.6" LED backlit display  screen is stunning with its 3200x1880 pixel resolution - 5 times the resolution of HD. It makes it great for zooming in on photo/video editing. It's the best looking screen that I have ever seen on a laptop.The NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M graphics card with 2GB of memory makes movies and videos look sharp and clear and games play fast and smooth on the high settings.The Waves MaxxAudio Pro 5.0 sound system sounds good but I like the Beats Audio system on my HP 17.3" Pavilion laptop better. Crisper tones with a clear bass. This sound system sounds a bit muffled.I especially like that this laptop has a touch screen. It is so much easier to use than a touchpad or a mouse.It was easy to set up. It took less than 30 minutes to go through the eight steps of the initial set-up and to be up and running and connected to the Internet.This has the 1TB hard drive, which will hold a ton including all my pictures and music. There's also a 32GB solid-state drive. It's a cache drive, which helps make it really fast. It boots up in less than 10 seconds. There's 16GB of RAM and has the Intel i7-4712HQ quad core 2.2Ghz processor.There's an HDMI output if you want to connect it to a larger monitor or your big screen television. It comes with 1 - USB 2.0 port and 3 - USB 3.0 ports. I like that it has a backlit keyboard, which my HP doesn't have.It comes with Dragon Assistant voice recognition software, which I haven't used yet but I will soon because I like using voice recognition technology.The battery seems to last just under four hours.I take videos and like to make home movies on the computer and took 14 videos off of my camera and produced a short movie effortlessly. Again, the quality of video and pictures on the screen is so much better than a regular laptop that it makes editing much more fun.The cons:There's no optical drive for my CDs, movies, programs, or games. I'll have to use a USB drive for them - not as handy. I realize that this computer is extra-thin and an optical drive would have not been feasible but I miss having one at hand.I prefer to use Ethernet for my main computer to connect to the Internet for bill paying and things like that and there is no Ethernet connection on this computer.The major thing I don't like has to do with Windows 8.1 and isn't really a reflection on the laptop. There's a learning curve with 8.1 and I just like Windows 7 more. I guess Windows 8.1 was "designed for a more responsive touch experience; helps you interact naturally with your content."I did find a PDF guide on the Dell website. It's called "Update Power User Guide for Business." That helped familiarize me with some of the 8.1 quirks.I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking to upgrade. It is a slick machine.

$review_text.: My first attempt at this endeavor was with another brand that shall go nameless. It was similar in features and price to this Yamaha RXV475, but was problematic. It took some thought on my part to try again with this unit. My TV, the Bluray player, the CD player, the USB drive, and the DirecTV receiver all hooked up with HDMI cables, and everything worked just as it was designed. I have not tried any network or computers with it, as that is not important to me. What is important is playing my music through 5 channels and watching videos and TV with 5.1 sound, and being able to rely on it. The PDF Manual is quite good, and the YPOW speaker setup works pretty cool. I ultimately replaced my old speakers and sub with Polk Audio units, and this Yamaha drives them perfectly. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Delivery was on time by Big Brown, and I thank Yamaha for great price!

$REVIEW.: This power supply has been good and seems very reliable. my only grip would have to be that the cords are a bit on the short side, if you like to do cable management for a cleaner look that is. if you don't care about the aesthetics of the in side of the computer, this power supply will do.

$review_text.: Seriously, let's keep it 100.  I own at least 5 of these "replacement" batteries for my cameras and lights.  Lessons learned, buy the real deal because you get a deal.  Now this is the deal: they last as long as the battery that came with the camera.  A replacement is suppose to "replace" the previous one in all aspects.  It doesn't.  If it don't say SONY, it's full of bologna.  Any brand name product will list all of its features and specs.  Replacement batteries don't.  I used one on my Alpha 55 on a video shoot.  Fully charged...lasted 15 minutes.  I was pisst as mutha...bleep!  I'm smart enough to buy a plug-in AC adapter for all my cameras with my own power supply just in case of emergencies.  This replacement battery is just as bad.  Used it on my CN-160 LED Lights, lasted 1hour of continuous use.  The Sony brand, 3 and a half hours and I turned it off!  Spend the money on brand names because it's an investment not an expense.  Peace.

On the good side -  installation is easy, it doesn't get too hot after prolonged use and looks sleek with other electronics.

$REVIEW.: I had no issues with this router. I have waited 3 months to write the review, and it is still in service.To give respect to load, I have 5 cabled computers (using a switch since this router has 4 ports), 3 smart phones, 2 tablets and 3 laptops. This does not count visitors who frequent my house and also increase my load.I have also recommended it to a friend and local business owner who owns a motel. This device seems to handle wireless load very well, with a ball-park estimate of 15-20 wireless devices (keeping in mind that they all do not stream video at once, etc.)As someone who does his own networking and his own homework, I have read (but not experienced personally)that it seems these routers may have some issues regarding the way this router handles some ISP's (internet companies), specifically out in California, so when in doubt run a web search. This device works fine with Comcast(cable) and AT&T; (ADSL) services.All said, no problems on this end.

The top vertical one is too close to the mobo.That's it. So far I am very satisfied while providing the caveat that this is my first case purchase in 9 years.  But for the price, you can't go wrong.

After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to go with these
I'm happy with them, the sound isn't incredible, but it's MUCH better than the iPod buds

They come with different sized cups to fit various sized ears


They fit comfortably, don't fall out (unless I'm exercising, I wouldn't recommend these for workouts) and don't become irritating after long listening periods
For $10, you can't beat these

Installation was a breeze, and I couldn't be happier with the case aside from one problem


I realized that the included USB 3.0 cable was broken on my case and the blue shroud that covers the pins was stuck in the header on my motherboard


I had to use needle-nose pliers to remove the shroud from the motherboard

Since then, I immediately contacted Bitfenix and I haven't heard back from them despite being told I would get a response within two business days
After a little bit of googling, I noticed that this is a common problem with Bitfenix customer support


I may have to contact Amazon directly to get a replacement if possible.

$REVIEW.: I bought this at BestBuy on Friday because I thought I might return it(after reading the reviews). I took it to my church's presentation of 'Nutcracker' on Saturday(It was very good). I also brought my Canon SX130IS(semi compact camera that also shots 720HD) for a real side-by-side test. Switched the resolution to 720 on the Samsung. I was not there to record the show. This is what I did....I would shoot about 1 minute, switch cameras and finish the scene with the Canon. That way, the lighting was the same, etc. I would zoom in and out being careful not to digitally zoom on the Canon. Canon is a 12X optical zoom vs 10X for the Samsung. The Samsung was noticeably grainy. My Canon was clean and clear...big difference. Before running out and buying the Canon, it also has a flaw. It will lose focus sometimes when panning. I discovered this a little too late but I can live with it. Takes excellent pictures. Back to the Samsung, one other thing I discovered...when you zoom in and out(it is quite fast and smooth)you can hear yourself using the zoom ring at the back of the camera, an annoying click or whir. I ws planning on using the camera in lowlight indoor/outdoor recordings so taking everything into consideration, the bluriness and clicking sound...back to BB for a refund. My Canon is better, I think I'll forgo a HD camcorder for under $200. One more thing...it is very light...why, because it is all cheap plastic. If you drop this camera, it'll be a pile of black plastic. Battery/SD card slot door very flimsy too. Sorry Samsung...Love your TV's

$REVIEW.: This was my fourth and fifth Palm.  I started with the old Palm Pilot, upgraded to color with the M505, got a Tungsten E (eventually the speaker went), then two E2s. The first E2 the digitizer got off and could not be corrected.  But I loved it so much that I got a new one.  I loved the new one too until one night it would not turn on (and has not turned on since).  It seems the reliability has gone down since they started making them in China.Positives:1) Open system (IR port, 3rd party software, memory cards etc.)2) Audible sound at least as good as an IPOD (see my review of the Ipod Touch I replaced it with)3) Real one player is more functional on the road than I-tunes4) Personal productivity software (to do lists, note pads, spreadsheets, databases  etc.)5) Documents to Go syncing with Microsoft OfficeNegatives1) Availability (I did not get a third largely because no one stocked them locally and I was in a hurry)2)  Reliability3) Dated hardware vs. the new touch screens; also some minor issues like only supports memory cards up to 1 Gigabyte.4) No vibrating alarm (ahh for the M505 even with its dim screen)5) Documents to Go screwed up my synchronizationIt seems that Palm has given up on its PDAs (they may be on their way out).  But even after having two of these die on me, I hope they come back and if they come out with an upgrade, I'll gladly buy it.

$review_text.: While the new "long life" NIMH cells have made a tradeoff of lower self discharge for lower capacity, people who charge their batteries just before use (e.g. before  a photo shoot) will appreciate the extra capacity of the 2700 mah cell.  A typical 1 month old eneloop cell will deliver 1500 mAh, while a freshly charged sanyo 2700 cell does deliver 2700 mAh.  That's nearly twice the energy available.  While the eneloop cells work well in remote controlls and devices that don't get alot of use, the high capacity cells should be considered for photoflash, digital camera, and other high drain applications.As shown in the photos above these are shipping in 2 wrappers, the white sanyo and the green sanyo/ge - the cell inside appears electrically identical but marketed differently.There are alot of cells packaged 24-100 ea per pack from various made in china battery companies - while labeled 2500-2700 mAh, tested against the sanyo these bulk batteries barely hit 1000 mAh and many don't make it that far despite their label.  The local frys has been moving these by the pallet at bargain basement prices but they are not true high capacity cells.  To date I've only seen sanyo and Yuasa make a real 2700 mAh (guarateed 2500) cell which is more charge than even alkaline batteries, albeit at 1.3V instead of 1.5V  - if you need a higher voltage a new nickel iron chemistry has hit the market at 1.65 V and is rechargableThe 2700 mAh sanyo / GE battery comes in different colored cells (some white/orange some silver/green but the same battery).  In all my testing the 2700 GE/Sanyo has been by far the best NiMH AA.The eneloop scheme means the batteries come "pre-charged" but only hold 2000 mAh, or about 75% of these out of the charger.  You pay every time you use them for that convenience of having it charged when you get it.  That's a Win once, loose a thousand times in a row scenario.  You can't even get those odds in Vegas.The 2700 has consistently been a top performer, exceeding MAHA's offering at 2700 (which comes out under 2500 on their own tester).  In real use, products that would run for 1 day on "normal" 1850 mAh cells or NiCd cells run almost 2 days on the 2700 sanyo's.Trying to find these has been difficult.  I bought some 2 weeks ago and now they are "unavailable" - HELLO AMAZON - RESTOCK THESE - Christmas is comming and we need them!Finally - these offer tremendous current capacity so your cameras and flashes will charge and operate faster.Having tested over 2 dozen brands and sizes of batteries, these came to the top of the pack quick.  At 12.99, their price to performance number was excellent too.  You can pay more, but you can't find a better performing cell.
$SUMMARY.: Almost 40% more energy than eneloop cells [2000 mah]

$review_text.: Pros:-Share internet with up to 5 wifi devices simultaneously-Dual-band performance (2.4GHz and 5GHz)-Easy start-up, connection setting, and interface-Highly portable; wifi router can work on its own batteryCons:-Although the company recommends up to 5 wifi devices, I found that 4 devices was the limit without the device failing.  Connecting 5 devices made the DIR-510L restart automatically, or fail and then make me restart it.-Can only work as either wifi router OR charger at any one time.-"Secure network connection" is only valid between the router and the device; router to internet is not secure.  A solution for this is to use a virtual private network (VPN) to "secure" internet connection (or at least more secure than non-VPN connection).Overall, my new favorite portable wifi router.  Highly recommended.Connection is easy, though you have to follow a series of steps correctly or you will have issues with connecting.  What worked for me was as follows:-Charge the battery overnight.-Keep plugged in, and power up DIR-510L.  You will see that the unit will either work as a battery charger OR a portable wifi router.-Wait one minute, and then you will see the SSIDs DIR510L (for 2.4GHz) and DIR510L_5GHz (for 5GHz).  Select either one to connect.-Open a web browser, and type in "http://192.168.0.1" in the address bar (without the quotes)-At the login screen, leave the password field blank (ie. no password)-At the home screen page, you can change the admin security settings for logging in to the router configuration interface.  It is highly recommended that you create a password with a minimum of six characters to keep your router secure.  The router will reset and you will then be asked to put in your password.-On the "Home" page, you can secure your wireless network. To secure your network, you may customize your Wi-Fi Network Name (SSID) and Password by clicking on the DIR-510L icon. You may choose different network settings for the 2.4 GHz and 5GHz bands.-Click on the DIR-510L router icon with the next to it to start the wizard-Click Secure your network in the pop-up window-On the Wi-Fi Settings page, enter the Wi-Fi Network Name (SSID) and Password for both the 2.4 GHz and 5GHz bands (enter password with minimum 8 characters)-Click "Save"-Now you have secured your wifi and login for the DIR-510L!!!To connect to wifi hotspot:On the Home page, when you wish to connect to the Internet using a Wi-Fi hotspot, there will be a next to the Internet icon. Click the icon to start the wizard.*You will see a pop-up window that says "The router is not connected..."  Click Next to scan for an available Wi-Fi network.*Locate the Hotspot Network you would like to connect to and click "Select"*You will be required to enter a Password if there is a lock icon next to that network. Enter the Passwordand click "Save"*Wait while the router connects to the network-->This method worked successfully for me 1) at my home network, 2) at a local Starbucks, and 3) at a hotel wifi.To use as a wifi router:-Connect network port with RJ45 network cable to a router, switch, or modem.-Power on, and use the same settings a above.-->Now you have a wifi router with your own settings.
$review_summary.: Very good portable wifi router and hotspot, with limitations

$REVIEW.: I've had this bag for a few years now. I is a nice bag but, the giant velcro piece on the outer flap is very noisy! This is almost always an issue since photographers are most likely shooting in places where they don't want to be noticed like weddings, events, nature, special places, nature, etc. The outer flap is the only cover for the top of the bag so, you can't place it behind since it prevents stuff from falling out or being stolen.The shoulder strap is also permanently attached to the bag and is very wide. The strap padding is also very large and not removable. It gets twisted with the strap. Since the strap has no way to rotate where it is sewn on the bag, this can be a hassle.I think all of these issues are fixable but, will Crumpler address function over form?

$REVIEW.: Picked this up at my local Fry's to put into an older PC so I could hook it up to my new TV. Worked great at first, easy install, card isn't huge so it fit great. Looked like it was going to be smooth sailing until I tried to do a clean install of Windows 8.The card caused graphical glitches during install (pretty common apparently if you ask Google) and I wasn't even able to get into Safe Mode. Pulled the card back out and swapped to an older card and was able to get into Windows fine so I know the card (drivers technically) was the issue. No matter how I installed drivers or messed around I was not able to get into Windows 8 with this card. Went back to Fry's and swapped to anMSI Radeon HD5450 Pcie 1GB DDR3 HDmi Dvi VGA 650MHZ 64BIT Heatsinkand now everything works great.Bottom line: If you're putting this into a Windows 7 machine it works great for its price point (I didn't buy it for gaming and didn't test it as such). If you're trying to put it into a Windows 8 machine it may be possible, but you're better off with an AMD card that just hits the ground running. I rated this 3/5 stars because I'd give it 5 stars for a Win7 machine and 1 star for a Win8 machine.

Gamers need to take heed of some things though...ProsGreat feel while typing, the clicks are wonderful and very tactial.Look is great. I like the illuminated keys.Did increase my typing speed slightly.I like the Function keys with shortcuts.ConsIf you are gamer, be wary. This keyboard DOES have the keyblock. I confirmed this in Bad company2. I noticed that I can not move forward (W) with sprint (shift) and jump (space) at the same time. Very very annoying. I also experience some weird moments where I would drop out of crouch while holding down Left control. Not game breaking but throws my game off.The price seems high on this item.The keyboard legs that snap out need to be about 1" higher. It lies nearly flat which is awkward for me. I have to prop the keyboard up.I would suggest serious gamers look at the other keyboards but for everyone else... This is for you!

$REVIEW.: I just purchased a 61" DLP TV from Amazon, and wanted to replace the multi speakers and wires running all over the room (per my wife's request!).  I looked at Bose (very expensive) and several other systems that uses just two speakers and a woofer.  I settled on the Philips HTS6500.  I had some experience with Philips in Europe.  Well, the sound is very good and the unit looks great on the TV stand.  Does not have all the options that the multisystems have - bass adjustment etc., but the 'beef' behind the sound is strong and will rattle your windows....  Takes a little time to 'learn' the remote - but is simple enough to use.  Buy - you will not be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: This speaker has excellent sound quality! I have some pretty decent bose speakers on my computer at home and this speaker actually has better sound quality than those speakers and it can get pretty loud without distorting. Nice bass and highs.The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is it is not truly wireless. You have to plug this thing into a wall, which seems really silly when the idea is for it to be a bluetooth speaker. If it was battery operated you could actually move it wherever you wanted too and you could even travel with it if you wanted too.Even though it isn't wireless though I use it all the time. I play my iPod through it all the time. The bluetooth reaches about 20-25 feet in my house. It's pretty good, I cant quite go to the very opposite side of the house, but almost.Great speaker, but why were batteries not an option?

The infrequent recharge meant that I usually forgot that I had plugged it in the night before and when I would pick it up off my desk, the short charging cord would jerk taut causing it to get yanked out of the port. I was afraid I would damage my tablet!The longer length of this cord means I have enough time when I notice the cable is plugged in to stop and not jerk the cord out.

At first I only had occassional connectivity problems.  Within 2 months, I can not use wireless unless I am in the same room as the box because it must be reset every 10 minutes or so due to loss of wireless connection.  Even hardwiring to the unit losses connection frequestly.  I was on for 26 minutes this morning and had to reset the box 4 times.....  Absolutely unacceptable.

$review_text.: This is an EXACT fir for MBP 15 (2012) model.  I really like how this "skin" keeps "crumbs" from getting under and in-between the keys!  This isn't a permanent solution to keeping the key board clean but for under $2, I wouldn't mind replacing these every 2-3 months or so.  IMHO, the only negative thing I can think of is that this cover keeps the back lighting dull even at full brightness.  But this is very minor and would not prevent me in reordering more.
$SUMMARY.: VERY nice for the price!

$REVIEW.: The original battery lasted about 4 years and this replacement, although fitting pretty tight, does work well.  I recent storm caused a brief minute power outage and the computer I had on the UPS unit never went down!  My backup unit's LCD screen no longer displays the leading hundreds digit so at first I thought my battery was defective. There has been another power outage overnight while I was sleeping and after seeing this outage, I can confirm that this replacement is working as required! No problems and a good purchase for money.

$review_text.: I was looking for a wireless card for an old IBM ThinkPad 390X running Windows 98SE


I considered the Linksys, a Belkin and a Netgear and after reading positive and negative reviews of all of them, defaulted to my standard: buy the cheapest one that'll work


I had quite a time getting the driver to install and that's my major complaint


Maybe that's the fault of Windows 98, who knows

The driver installation process kept hanging up because one or another DLL file was not found


I finally had to do some online research on this and also downloaded the driver and some other software from Linksys

I finally got the drivers installed and the card actually works fine


I would hesitate to recommend this to someone with an old machine who isn't very computer savvy, but it's a cheap solution that worked out okay for my needs.

$REVIEW.: It's hard to tell the features apart from the shortcomings, frankly. They keys are small. They have to be. They QAZ keys are right up against the left edge, so you will find your left hand slowly drifting rightward, away from the edge. But, it's good enough for touch-typing with some practice. Much better than touch-typing on the screen or on those Blackberry keys.The slot for holding up the mini is pretty solid and stable, and has a touch of magnetism that requires you to twist the mini a little bit to make it come off. I wish it could be further back, but I'm thinking that would make it more tippy. So, again, not ideal, but, by necessity, good enough.The screen and the keys do end up being a bit too close together for comfortable typing. If you are typing anything long, you will want a separate stand. For portability, I recommend the Daffodil IPC140, which is just sturdy enough to hold up the screen, and is super light, which means it's not sturdy enough for touch-screen gaming. There are many other stands that work better if you don't need light weight.The magnets are on the weak side. The cover may flip open, or just come off, if you drop the whole thing, so it's not fantastic as a protective cover. It's more of a scratch-protection cover for sticking it in a purse; my purse has a pocket just the right size, and I also got a Neoprene case.The keyboard does not flip to the back of the mini. You can lay it flat with the mini, or take it apart and put the mini into the slot. If you want to put the mini on another stand, you have to take it off the keyboard. Fine for my purposes.Battery life seems to be as advertised. What would be really nice is if the keyboard and the mini could be charged on one cable, instead of two, but they are seldom charged at the same time, are they.It's pretty light for what it does. I'm impressed.
$SUMMARY.: Some flaws, but they are necessary compromises.

$review_text.: I got this laptop mainly for the price the 15.6" display screen, and the decent 2.3 processor.I've had this laptop since January, and I'm happy to say the only problem I've experienced is the speaker quality which is sub par to say the least. If you have the web cam running while you're trying to play something that needs sound, you'll have a very difficult time straining to hear it. I haven't had any problems with the web cam quality, and I used it every day while studying abroad for 5 months.As with every new computer, the keyboard took a little getting used to because most laptops don't include the num-pad, but I found it to be a happy surprise.I'm an artist and I use photoshop pretty often. The program never takes long to load, and has a good response time with my graphics pad. I also like the size of the screen when using a program like this since it makes me feel like I'm working with more of a canvas than a computer.What I also found to be an interesting security trick that they have is the facial recognition for logon. The only problem with that is that it's extremely fickle! It never seems to recognize me despite the number of photos I've taken for the program to work. I'm happy to say that there is always the good-ol'-fashioned password access for the logon though, which is a never-fail. All in all, I'm happy with this product and would recommend it to the casual computer user.Update 8/28/12:I have encountered a new problem with this laptop.  I was working on it doing something very simple (writing out an email), and without warning, my computer shut off.  No blue screen of death, or a warning about a virus, just black..off.I called the Asus maintenance department (rerouted to a company in India), and I was told (without giving them much information about my computer) that I had a virus and that someone would be over to back up my files and give me a new operating system for $180.  (It doesn't even get to BIOS so it couldn't possibly be a virus.)Luckily, the computer was able to later turn on after tapping on the back of the computer and taking out the battery pack to do the old nintedo game blowing trick.  I was able to back up all of my files myself, but when I later tried plugging in speakers into the usb outlet, the computer shut off again.Not sure what this is all about, but I do know that the price I paid for this was not worth it.

$review_text.: I have an older 13&#34; MacBook and the original batter has lasted until now.  It was still functioning, but it was bulging.  I ordered the  Aibocn Ultimate Version New Replacement Battery for Apple A1185 1185 A1181 Macbook 13&#34; Series as a replacement and it arrived quickly in good condition.  After installing it, the orange LED light on the power cord came on and the screen icon indicated it was charging.  After a few minutes, the orange LED went to green and the icon indicated no battery was present.  After a pretty serious internet search, I found that this was a fairly common problem.  There were many suggestions on how to correct the problem, but none of them worked for me.  Just to make sure it wasn't the computer, I put the old battery in and it immediately began charging.  I had to conclude that the new battery was either defective or incompatible with the A1181 (it lists it is compatible with a series of 13 inch MacBooks. I sent it back and ordered this battery.  It also arrived quickly and in good shape.  I installed it and it the computer recognized it.  I also noted it had an 80% charge on arrival.  Obviously time will tell how good this battery is, but it's off to a good start.

The only challenge I've had is my old camera bag makes it a challenge to keep the padding from pressing against the hood (I fear that it will change the shape over time), but I can always take it off.  The hood is simple to operate with one hand to pull out, or collapse the hood.  Very affordable option!

$REVIEW.: Along with many of the other reviewers here on Amazon, I too was plagued with bugs on my Nexus 10 on Android version 4.2.1. Chrome browser would suddenly become unresponsive and eventually would lead to a crash and restart of the entire tablet to resolve this problem. HOWEVER, in the last few days, I have received the updated version of Android 4.2.2. Since receiving the update, I have not had a single instance of crashing or unresponsiveness on the tablet! This is the beauty of having updates straight from Google (the reason behind a "Nexus" branded device)! With a Nexus device, you will always have the latest software updates directly from Google within 3 days of it being released! You can't possibly beat that experience. The problem that most people have on other Android tablets and phones is that manufacturers like Samsung, Asus, Archos, LG, HTC, etc. all add their own features on TOP of the pure android code. This means that when a newer version of Android is finally released by Google, these manufacturers must take the code all over again and re-optimize their software to run on top of it every time! As I'm sure you can imagine, this is an arduous process that takes a while for the manufacturer especially when that manufacturer has to do the exact same thing to every one of its devices on the market. This leads to tablets and phones that remain on old software because either the company is still working on re-optimizing their overlay OR they simply decided to stop updating the devices because it's too much work to keep up with each and every one of their products. In the sense of Nexus devices, this is never the case!! Nexus devices run on PURE Android software with NO overlays. This software comes directly from Google and whoever built the tablet is NOT allowed to add any of their own proprietary software on top of the device. Google will have full control of what happens with that tablet. This means that you will ALWAYS have the latest and greatest features from Google IMMEDIATELY (1-3 days) after it is released!! Please use this information to help you decide on your next Android experience. This goes for the Nexus 10, Nexus 7, Nexus 4, and Samsung Galaxy Nexus (GSM version). I WILL ALWAYS BUY ONLY NEXUS DEVICES as doing anything else means my product would  literally be "old" within 6 months (which I know everyone hates.)

$REVIEW.: The difference between the speed of this card and others is significant.  Even the Trenscend Class 10 16GB card was slow compared to this.In low light conditions it's fast.  The access to the card is very fast also.  For the price compared to all others this card beats them all.  It seems that the "class" levels don't matter, it's the megabits per second is what matters.  Class cards just show a minimum read/write speed, but don't display or lack max read/write speed.For professional photographers this is a must.

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these a few months ago to use in a rather unforgiving environment and it has performed perfectly with no faults
Plug it in and go
We use our own burning software so I can't comment on the bundled Nero CD.I just bought another one for myself (and notice the price has gone up $5)

The mechanism in this second one seems somewhat loose (it shifts forward and back a little inside the outer housing)
I'd fault Amazon's rather scant packaging not holding up to UPS's handling, not a fault of the drive itself.

$REVIEW.: Got this board for my first Hackintosh
 Only one setting in the BIOS needed changing off the bat, and the board is exceptionally stable
 Can't beat Amazon's shipping speed, either
 Board easily fits an EVGA GTX670FTW along with a TP-link Wireless-N card immediately beside it
 Gigabit ethernet works great, and the BIOS setting for any XMP-enabled RAM should work fine as well
 Works great with 16 gigs of Corsair Vengeance.OF NOTE: there are only three system fan headers on this board, and the sysfan2 header runs at 5 volts

 Any normal 12v fan will work, but it will only run ~500 RPM

 It is really meant for a 4-pin power modulating fan


 I'd recommend buying a couple molex-3pin adapters for other case fans.The board does not have a speaker built into it - so if you need the tones to troubleshoot while you're building or booting, you'll want to buy one separately


 Additionally, it does not come with a CMOS reset jumper

 Simple enough to just disconnect power, take the CMOS battery out, and short the terminals of the CMOS jumper with a screwdriver or anything else that conducts.

It helps water and crud from betting between the keys.It muffles the sound coming from the speakers (wherever they are) - but all you have to do is to flip the cover over and it'll sound fine (or I've learned to live with the muffled sound, it doesn't bother me much.)Also, the F keys up top (ie. F1, F2) don't really match up with my new Macbook air. Specifically, the volume buttons. They're one key off.

$REVIEW.: I'm hard to impress.  I've gone through many, many messenger/computer bags over the years.  This bag is a winner!  First, it is TSA compliant through a unique laptop/iPad/netbook padded zippered compartment which opens up allowing the computer to lay flat on the belt or in the standard TSA plastic container.  This padded computer compartment can hold both a laptop and iPad/Tablet/netbook in separate padded areas.  This is in addition to a large main compartment for books, papers, etc.  Second, this bag has more compartments, both zippered and unzippered than I've ever seen in a Messenger Bag.  There are nooks and crannies for papers, pencils, smartphones, and all manner of gadgets.  These are well placed and easy to reach.  There are numerous outside compartments, zippered and not zippered, for stuff you need to get to quickly without opening the bag.Overall bag construction is very heavy duty and it looks good.  Mine is a grey/black color with some reflective patches on the front.  It's stylish without looking gaudy or geekish.  It's fairly light weight for its size.  It's oxford nylon fabric with a waterproof liner.  The shoulder strap is well padded and adjustable for virtually any carrying position from shoulder to waist.  The shoulder strap adjuster is a CAM buckle arrangement which makes for quick and easy length adjustment.  I adjusted the bag so it rides on my waist.  The contour and fit is perfect.This will likely now be my main bag for carrying my laptop, iPad, smartphone and books.  This bag is fairly large though Timbuk2 says it is a "Medium".  I'd hate to see the large size.  Medium is more than big enough to carry a days' worth of stuff without weighing a ton.  I highly recommend this well-made messenger bag.

It just works well

Sharp pictures, lots of scene modes and easy to change from picture mode to movie mode (just flick the switch on the top)
I find the pictures alot clearer and sharper than the newer cameras my wife has since bought

The newer ones seem to be junk and just advertise their ever increasing Mega pixels without even addressing the picture quality

We have returned them and she has just bought this one to match mine
It's also small and light and can fit easily into my jeans pocket when im going out

At the end of the day if you want a good point and shoot camera with a great lens that gives you great pictures and movies do not hesitate

I'm glad i got mine before they discontinued it.

Also, I thought they had left out the USB cable, but it was hidden inside one of the papers / cardboard, so be sure to pull it all out.
$SUMMARY.: works!

$REVIEW.: So far my impressions of the Corsair H50 compact liquid CPU cooler are very good. I have a Cosmos S case and I had an Ultra ChillTech Peltier CPU cooler in it that worked fine but was loud and big and took up too much space. So, finally, I saw the Corsair and decided to give it a try.If you get this cooler, please take your time and really study the instructions....They aren't very clear. The spacers for the 775 circular ring bracket fit UNDER the feet of the bracket but looking at the instructions you could easily think that the plastic spacers go on top of the bracket feet as I did. It can be very tedious to install and line up with the screws. Also, the back radiator and fan assembly can be a pain to line up on the back of your compter and line up to insert and tighten the screws. Never-the-less, this is a small issue and basically the H50 is a well designed unit, just take your time installing it. The pictures on the instructions are a little vague, but if you really study them a bit you'll see the correct way to install the brackets, unit. etc. I'm giving it 4 out of five stars not because of any physical design issues with the unit itself but because of the poorly written instructions that can misguide you if you're not paying attention and too anxious to install it and see how it works.I have had it on my computer running now for about one day and so far it is very quiet and seems to work well and do the job. I like this unit so far and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to change out their larger, clumsy, heavy CPU cooler for a much more sleek, efficient one.PWN
$SUMMARY.: Nice cooler, but take your time installing it

$review_text.: This compact point and shoot is a great little camera and can do some fantastic macro photos for you!  I have had this camera since 2008, and it has worked great the entire time.  Originally I bought this camera to take pictures through a microscope for my zoology class and it worked great for that, but you have to really keep your hands steady to get a crisp picture.  That being said, the dedicated macro function on this camera is very nice, making it easier to get those photos.I also took this camera to Scotland & Europe and got some great snapshots with it.  The main draw to this camera was that it is 1)compact, 2)had macro capabilities, 3)has great lenses (as you would expect from makers like Canon or Nikon), and 4)had the truest to color blues and purples of the compact cameras that I tested in my price range.  I have even used this camera at a wedding with my pictures (mainly due to better color & composition) turning out better than some of the relatives that had more expensive cameras.  The bride definitely expressed her appreciation on that one!The main functions available are: auto, manual, macro, portrait, night, color accent, color swap, and a custom setting that includes options for kids & pets, indoor, sunset/rise, foliage, snow, beach, fireworks, aquarium, and underwater. These settings allow you a lot of creative settings to help you get the most out of your photos.  If you do a lot of people shots, turning on the face detection function can be a real asset, making it easier for your camera to focus on the people.  However, you need to remember to turn this function off if there aren't people in your pictures or you will get really frustrated.  You can also take multiple shots, continuous, delayed 10 & 2 second timers.Another nice feature to this point and shoot is the manual settings.  You can adjust your white balance, iso, adjust exposure (exposure compensation), take limited color photos (B&W;, sepia, vivid, neutral, positive film, lighten skin tone, darken skin tone, vivid blues, vivid greens, vivid reds,or custom colors), adjust metering (spot, center weighted, or evaluative).If you want to use this camera with a tripod you can, seeing as it includes a screw port for that function.  The camera is 8.0 MP with a 3x zoom lens with up to 1600 iso.  The camera can also take video which is always a nice feature to have.

$review_text.: I purchased this network attached storage drive enclosure because my previous (and very buggy) NAS was failing

 I wanted to take some time to make sure I had made the right choice, and to figure out how to use this unit

 As this unit is a "bring your own drive," I also ordered two SATA hard drives to place inside of it

 When everything arrived, I easily found the release latch for the cover, and inserting the drives was simple

 The power button was harder to find (it's on the front, and blends in well).After firing up the unit, I entered the Web interface and found the setup fairly straight forward
 My biggest problem is that this drive gives A LOT of control to the user, and I really had to figure out the interface and various settings before I could proceed
 You can manage an FTP server, Web interface, download torrent files, iTunes server, media server, and it supports several protocols that I've never even heard of

 My biggest headache came in the attempted creation of shared folders
 Unlike most file trees, the unit didn't have arrows or ticks to get to sub-directories


 Instead, users have to guess


 Click the "Volume_1" name and a spinning disc will reveal sub-directories and give the option to create new ones.Because I had a large amount of data, I wasn't able to get it all transferred from the old NAS onto the D-Link before my old unit failed - and it doesn't have recoverable hard drives, like the DNS-320.I truly think this unit is a solid one, and that, if I have any hard drive or hardware issues, it will be a simple matter of pulling the bad drive, dropping in a new one, and letting the software rebuild the data


 I highly recommend this unit - just have the time and patience for an early learning curve.

$REVIEW.: I had been wanting to try a powerline product out for a couple of years. But since I already run a wireless N system throughout my house successfully I didn't want to sink more money in trying to increase my already sufficient speed. Well, when the Gold Deal came up at $47. for the Kit I couldn't pass it up. It arrived the NEXT DAY!!!So, as a a good consumer should i researched problems and tribulations of using this set. And, I was ready for the password failure.... happened immediately and multiple attempts did not resolve it. I then called the customer service line which put me in touch with an English speaking support person +++  The tech talked me through the Privacy name change and I was up and running in just over an hour (from opening the box). My system consists of having my router upstairs in my computer room. This is where I installed my Home unit. The other end is downstairs for my home entertainment center (BluRay, HTC, Wii, 360 attached to a 73 Mitsu DLP TV.) Hooked up my remote unit here and plugged my switch into it. End result was the same 65Mb hook up as my wireless network. However, my throughput double from just over 4Mb to almost 9Mb/per second. My cable company tops me out at 9Mb/per second. I should have glorious Amazon streaming now in HD (it was pretty damned good before... LOL).So I give this unit 5 stars across the board. Though it did have the password issue, the tech support department was all over it.UPDATE: Okay, so after two months I have not had to reset these devices once. I have a consistent 135Mb hook up rate with a throughput that equals my maximum of 9Mb from my cable company. I am a happy camper and this device blows my wireless network out the window. Thanks Trendnet!!!

$REVIEW.: I'm using it with my iPod and a Bose blue tooth &#34;brick&#34; speaker... size and weight are about the same as a brick.  The blue tooth transmitter works great!  The sound from my speaker is awesome.  I've only used it for distances of about 20', so I'm not sure how far I can get away from it.  As expected, the battery on the iPod does go down quicker.  I usually can get about 70 songs+ out of a single charge.  (using a wired connection, the blue tooth appears to about cut the time in half, so wired, I'd easily get 150+ songs out of a single charge.  Considering that my iPod is about 3-4 years old, I feel that is acceptable.  (naturally, with ear buds, the song count would be well past 500 songs)Bottom line, it does what I wanted and gives me freedom to move around the room with my iPod in my pocket, if I wish to do so.

$review_text.: I received this as a Christmas present from my wife and installed it the day after.  I am using it with our 32 inch LG in our Kitchen.  It sounds great and had no problems with set-up.  It was very easy.  It even sounded great in my garage, where I first tested it, before I hung it on the wall in the kitchen.  I had read about the LED lights going out and after 3 days the volume and input indicators disappeared, but the next day they were back.  To me the sound out weighs the LED light problem, because I don't listen to lights.  For my purposes it sounds great and I will be keeping mine even if the lights disappear again.Edit:  It has been 4 months since I have had the Vizio soundbar.  The lights did finally stop working, but it still sounds great.

$REVIEW.: Innergie mMini Combo 15W AC (Wall) Duo USB Charging Kit (ADP-15AC AA)Looking for an all-in-one charger, the Innergie mMini may be your answer? Need a charger that can charge high powered devices; requiring 10 Watts and 2.1 amps, as well as your normal low powered items, 5 Watts and 1.1 amps, has a small foot print, can charge two devices at one time, proclaims to feature all the required power regulating and safety features, reasonably priced, appears to be ported for both Apple and standard USB charging cables, and comes with the unique Innergie two-in-one Apple/micro mini USB charging cable, then, the 15 Watt Innergie mMini may just meet your needs.So far it has worked with my Kindle Fire and Droid 4


I don't own any Apple devices, but they claim it will charge the new high powered iPad


Seems well built, but it would be nice if the there was a cover for the AC plug prongs


It may be to small for folding prongs, then again, it seems other devices with folding prongs have a high rate of AC prong breakage reviews

It can easily be carried in a pocket, bag or purse, but the plug prongs may get tangled or worst, create a first aid incident


Best of all, it fits great on any of my Cocoon GRID-IT Organizers


I also own one of their three-in-one USB charging cables, very handy, but just a tad short


They also make a 10 Watt, dual port auto charger.Innergie is responsive to questions, but only via their Website, after you create an account

There Website is a bit hard to read, as the text is mostly in shades of gray.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this charger

Sometimes you do get what you pay for.UPDATE:Have put this puppy to the test and it's a winner


Easily charges, at the same time; iPad 3 and iPad 2, iPad 3 and Droid 4, Droid 4 and Kindle Fire and so on


It does get very warm when charging those power hungry devices
Oh ya, that cute blue light is cool
You can be a real hero at work if you have one of these and others have forgotten their chargers.

$review_text.: After one month the left-click button stopped working properly. Sometimes it registers a click, sometimes it double clicks.  If I click and drag, it just randomly clicks.PROS (both of my &#34;PROS&#34; are my opinion however)- Looks great (I like the flat black texture and the feel of it)- The size is comfortable (opinion)CONS- Very light (You need to have a very flat smooth surface to have accurate control)- Left mouse button stopped working correctly- Scroll wheel has almost no feedback (it doesn't click or have noticeable gaps. If you're cycling weapons or the like, you can skip right past items as you can't really tell how far you've gone.)- The side buttons require a far too much pressure to activate. I can't even keep the mouse in one place when trying to press one of these.  You have to squeeze the entire mouse to put enough pressure. If you're trying to press a side button while moving, it's impossible to keep your aim or mouse placement.- The side buttons are very hard to find. They don't stick out and are almost flush with the side of the mouse. Maybe if you can tolerate using this mouse long enough you'll be able to memorize where they are.- IT'S OBNOXIOUSLY BRIGHT!!!!  Whoever designed this is a horrible horrible person. The mouse glows bright blue and it does not turn off.  If you have this plugged into a computer where you sleep, you will need to put something over it to block out all of the light it emits.

$review_text.: This product is in what I would call beta stage but will hopefully get better as Hauppauge releases new firmware and software for it.It is missing vital features:1) It does not have the ability to fast forward and rewind MP3s.2) It will play an entire folder of MP3s or one MP3 at a time but it is missing is the ability to pick and choose MP3s you want to play. You have to go to the computer and create play lists, then the MVP will play those playlists.Bugs I have found:1) The MVP server software that runs on the computer and allows access to shared media has to be restarted once a week or more before the MVP will find the server.2) When playing videos (mpg, avi, etc) you can fast forward and rewind but often after doing so the audio gets out of sync with the video.Conclusion: Good, fair-priced device (under a hundred dollars) but it definitely needs some improvement. Also, be wary of wireless "Media Receivers." I have done some research on them and their biggest complaint is that they only work well when wired. That is why I bought the MVP, it is wired (only) so you are not paying for the wireless feature.

$REVIEW.: I had such high hopes for this TV especially after reading the glowing reviews by so many consumers. But I gotta tell ya, Vizio can't hold a candle to LG or Samsung. The picture is dull and lifeless. Stand ever so slightly to the side and the picture turns gray and grainy. The audio is very bassy and you have to turn the volume way up to hear anything. The apps are sparse. No Amazon cloud, no HBO Go. They have iHeart radio but it doesn't work. Vudu works, but the picture comes off dark and gloomy. I don't blame Vudu because Vudu on my LG is brilliant. I blame Vizio. People, stay away from this TV. Stay far away.

It WAS tough to program at first with the cable, but was user errors involved. My son copied Chirp on a cd and I booted from it. Very nice and easy now to change freqs and alphanumerics.This thing is great at any pricee. I used it on 2 meter repeaters and simplex and get very good reports. What's not to like. Scanning is slow, but didn't buy it as a scanner. Can't wait to buy another now that I have the cable and software set up. Might even buy 2 or 3 for replacement if the first one quits.It comes with a nice drop in charger and ear piece/microphone, but the internal one works fine.Also nice is the direct frequency input with the keyboard when in frequency mode. Just be csreful not to transmit where you are not licensed.Thanks Amazon for carrying these and getting it shipped here in a couple of days!

I would have given it 5 stars, but there were a few issues.One - the directions were lacking.  If you're a handy person and have a general understanding of how these mounts are installed you won't have an issue.Two - one of the brackets that attaches to the back of the tv was bent, but I knew it wouldn't affect the way it supported the tv.Three - the mini level that was supposed to be attached level wasn't and all the liquid was empty so that was useless.  This bracket comes with a great small magnetic level which did the trick!Overall, it's a great mount and mine even came with a 10' HDMI cable - BONUS!  I'll never again spend more than this on a tv mount.

$review_text.: My Sennheisher HD 202's lasted me for about 2 years, just right when the warranty expired.  Then the left ear shorted out.  For a $22 pair of headphones, I thought they were great cans.  Nothing blew me away in any of the songs on that, but I will say it was a major upgrade over any of my buds I had used.  Now I only use buds for the gym.Therefore I needed a new pair of cans.  I had to decide if I wanted 202's again or if I should try something new.  I thought about spending $100's on the Sennheiser audiphile series, but I realized that I am not doing critical listening.  I am listening to music, youtube or netflix on my laptop or ipod.  I noticed that this 400 series was designed to be driven by portable music devices.  This is important because some other cans may require you to be an amplifier to get their full potential out of such a device.I had to decide between 428/29 (same thing different design on each 8 or 9, 9 being  a year newer), 438/39, or 448/49The 428/29 was well reviewed and 428 refurbished headphones could be found for $30.  The highest end, 448/9 was actually reviewed somewhat similarly to the 28/29.  If you liked bass, and wanted a fuller sound, most audiophiles seemed to prefer the 438/39 in this series.  I could not find 38's anywhere, including refurbished.  I found 439's on Sennheiser's website or on Amazon as refursbished or used.At $99 on Sennheiser's website I decided on Amazon.  I noticed that the Pinnacle Deals company is actually Sennheiser USA's authorized repair center.  That made me feel better about buying this refurbished pair.All parts came that would come if you bought it new.  The only difference is that it was repackaged.  They sounded great right out of the box, with no burn-in.  On my laptop with the volume turned up they sound amazing.  I can pinpoint the bass drums, bass guitar, highs, mids, everything.  Nothing is muddled.  As I burn it in more I am sure it will sound ever better.  (I've used for about 30 hours so far).The ipod sounds good too, but to get that same great "wow" sound I need to turn the volume all the way up.  My laptop (macbook) seemed to do a better job driving these headphones.  For that reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.My final point is that the removable wires are great.  It comes with one short and one long wire instead of just one reallly long wire you have to coil up (like on the 202's).  The other great part about a removable wire...if the wire short out, you can just go on ebay or Amazon and buy a new one instead of a whole new set of headphones like I just had to do.  The wire snaps in on the left side only to reduced tangling and it stays very secure.  I do not hear any background noise.While I am sure this will not be my last pair of cans, they will certainly be my pair for awhile.

$REVIEW.: This product is a good investment for my sanity. With so many products that the children love to play, all at the same time, it is good to filter out some of the sounds so they don't crash with one another. Everything in moderation. Everyone's happy, especially me. The quality of the product is excellent and they are compfortable to wear. If I am in need of more headphones, these are the ones I will buy. The shipping and packaging were fast and well done.

$REVIEW.: These are by far the best speakers that I've ever owned, or heard for that matter. Until I had used these, my point of reference for &#34;good&#34; sound was my pair of Sennheiser HD518s, but this set of speaker blows even those away. For a 2.0 channel set, the bass is actually powerful and defined, and mids and highs are as clear as you could ever want them to be. I use them with my computer and Xbox, and they perform well for both functions. They're great for watching movies too; you'll feel like you're in a theater. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the quality. At $400, they are a little pricey, but the cost is well worth it and you'll never want to replace them after you get used to them. They've ruined me for listening to music on subpar speakers.

$review_text.: At half the price of other bluetooth keyboards, I've found that this little gem doesn't disappoint

It pairs easily with either my phone (LG Spectrum 2) and my tablet (Nexus 7), both running Android 4+


The size is large enough for my fingers and small enough to easily fit into my backpack or carry along with my tablet in one hand

It's also great having a backspace key again!It's ideal for taking meeting notes in Evernote on my tablet - I don't lug around a laptop to meetings anymore.

So I'm very content with this purchase.What would have me give it 5 stars instead of just 4? I would like to have keys to take me to the start and end of a line of text (Home & End)

That omission isn't unique to this keyboard - I haven't seen those two keys on many other small keyboards either


Also, while it may just be my fat, slow fingers from time to time when I tap a capital key I get a string of 5 to 7 of that letter on my display
Maybe I'm moving too slow so it may not be the keyboard's fault.But overall I'm very happy with this handy little keyboard.

$review_text.: Let's skip weight and price, this is a pro lens, they cost a lot and weigh a lot. My main focus is about image quality, and to be honest I was hesitant at first to get this lens. I already had the 2.8 non-IS, and it was a RAZOR with my 5D Mark II, superb image quality. The original IS version doesn't quite have the image quality when used with a 21mp sensor, and even the MTF charts show that. BUT, based on reviews, I decided to give Version II a go. BOTTOM LINE: Not only did Canon get this II version up to par in sharpness and contrast, they EXCEEDED it. This lens is from another planet, the quality is amazing. The focus is FAST and dead on, no microadjustment needed. The IS truly is greatly improved over version I, it really does give a 4-stop advantage. What blew me away was being able to shoot video, hand-held, at 200mm. You want 1/50 shutter speed when shooting 24fps video, and that shutter speed is slow for 200mm focal length, but the new version can DO it sharply! That's seriously good IS!Look, if you are able to save for this lens, you've got to take the plunge and get it over with. This new version has everything and most of all, the image quality is nuts, I wasn't expecting it to be THAT good. We're all going to have some seriously built forearms, because it's a heavy lens, and once you mount this thing on your camera, you won't be taking it off nor putting it down!

 It is not a tight fit, and the case is annoying


 It clicks on the base keyboard portion in the front, as it is not a tight &#34;grasp&#34; of the unit


 If it wasn't for this, I would have given it a higher rating, but with this being the problem, and annoying the hell out of me, I can't rate it higher than a &#34;generous 2 star&#34; rating.

$REVIEW.: So I've owned the New Trent Airbender for the iPad 3rd Gen and I have to say this little guy has an almost identical build (3rd Gen doesn't have the screen protector built in) but it works a lot better. Out of the box you have the case in two pieces, one for the iPad itself and one piece is the keyboard. If you've owned OtterBox cases before, the manner in which you get take apart the case and put the iPad Mini in is very similar and that says a lot. I love the OtterBox cases and the fact that they took on a similar design scheme with this case is great! It offers full protection of the iPad, covering all the ports except for the speakers with small closing flaps. The camera and screen are both encased behind a hard plastic clear shell that allows the camera to function perfectly and also allows you to make full use of the touch capacitive screen. When you have the case in ultra book mode (what I call it with the screen in landscape and using the keyboard) the screen stays in almost whatever position you set it in, which is a big plus over the fill size iPad case. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that the Mini is so much lighter. Anyway, I also say almost, because I have found an unstable position yet, but I won't rule it out. My only complaint is that the outer screen protector is a magnet for fingerprints, and I wish NewTrent would have included a small microfiber cloth to clean both the screen and the protector before putting everything back together. Also, I don't know how well the protector will stand up to the test of time. With OtterBox cases usually I end up taking the protectors off, so I'll update it a few months in the state of the protector. Overall I'd highly recommend tanis case. It adds a rugged look to the iPad Mini while adequately protecting it, and enhancing it's usability with the bluetooth keyboard! Which is easy to pair as well! Just turn bluetooth on the Mini on, turn on the keyboard after the first full charge and type of to the sequence it tells you to when connecting!
$SUMMARY.: Even better than the 3rd Gen iPad version!

$REVIEW.: I bought this system on the recommendation of LG customer service to assure it would work with my 32LK330 32-Inch 720p 60 Hz LCD HDTVG  purchased earlier in the year from Amazon.  I realize it's part my TV's fault and part the fault of the sound bar, but I see no improvement over the TV's speakers.The sound is muffled with intermittent crackling, in spite of trying all the fine tuning as indicated in the owners manual.  I finally got reasonable audio by unplugging the subwoofer and turning the TV speakers back on.  The sound bar then simply adds volume to the speakers output.I would send it back if I had someone to put it back in the box and have it shipped back to Amazon.  unfortunately, I cannot do this myself.  I guess I should consider myself lucky in that this is the only bulky and heavy bad buy I have made from Amazon.

It cuts out for half a second every now and then if I am on the opposite side of the house with my body between the phone and the receiver but im pretty sure I'm not going to be that far away trying to listen to music... If you have line of sight to the unit or close to line of sight then I guarantee you will be extremely happy with the audio quality. Even through a wall it sounds pretty dang good!

$review_text.: With a son who is two years into his software engineering degree, I've learned a lot about technology. One thing I've found is that expensive is not always best. After spending a bundle on my very first HDMI cable, it was okay, but no better than the cheap HDMI cables that he bought. At just under $30, the Belkin cable proved to impress us both.It is very thin, which I would usually worry about, but we put it through a durability test by plugging it in, shifting wires around, unplugging it, etc. and after a week, it's not any worse for wear. I don't know that I could say the same of the very first cable we ever bought that lasted three month, and that was without putting it to the test with did with this Belkin product. Belkin proves superior to that first cable.I did find the picture quality with the Belkin cable was excellent, perhaps a little better than the generic cable we were using, but my husband said he saw no different, so it might be wishful thinking. The one thing that did stand out and make Belkin's cable superior is the thin cable that was much easier to move and hide out of sight.

$REVIEW.: I bought this tablet because the Rep told me I could link with my pc. I tried to streama movie online from my computer but it does not flow. I thought it was the internet speed in the store but its the new samsung tablet.The Most troublesome thing about this tablet is, it says 2 GB of Ram, when its only 1.4 and with all the bloatware on this tablet it leaves almost no ram space. The 16 GB rom is actually 10gb. So you say you can use your sd card for your apps. Not on kit kat 4.4. Unless you root the tablet you can't do it. Lastly, Because of 4.4 kit kat downloading an archived flash player will only work on one browser: Dolphin. Not on any other. I returned my tablet and bought a Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition 32gb with 3GB of ram. It has 4.3 and it lets you move your apps to sd card plus flash player works on many browsers. The Only drawback for all of these tablets except the 12.2&#34; pro, It only uses 2.0 usb to charge. The 12.2 uses 3.0 which is alot quicker,like the note 3 phone. I hope this is helpful for you.

It is very sturdy, and the elastic strap works exceptionally well to close the case and the elastic is a wide strip so it feels like it will last a long time. My favorite feature of this case are the grooves to support my iPad for many different angles.

$REVIEW.: The absence of Adobe means I cannot retire the windows system yet. It is not Adobe but the producers of products and the cable company offering only those products.Now that we got rid of the only negative, if you have an iphone the learning curve is nil. A few exceptions; the Safari screen is a tad different. Some apps are grainy in the 2x mode. Response time can be a tad slow in comparison to other devices on the same Wi-Fi.I actually played with dedicated book readers before the purchase of this device as that is the primary goal. The top reason for iPad 2 over the readers is the viewing surface. Oh sure on a reader you can pick you r font. However you cannot pick your screen size.  As long as this is my reader of choice I though "oh well why not make it the computer as well." So being familiar with the iphone there would be almost no learning curve.  I picked the max memory (not that I will use more than a fraction of it) just because if for some reason I wanted more in the future  I would not have to worry if it was upgradable or not. I intend to use the blazes out or this iPad 2 until the technology no longer exists. So far I have only used the Wi-Fi part as one little security password and it was actively accessing the net.  Will pick 3g if traveling is in my plans.  So far there are just too many free hot spots. I may be over planning but it gives me peace of mind to know this animal can communicate with both systems and has plenty of memory.Mean time I am having a great time using this system primarily as a reader.As a reader this by the way does not require Adobe Flash.Owning an iPad as playing around with its potential remids me of the saying form `four quartets' by t.s. eliotWe shall not cease from explorationAnd the end of all our exploringWill be to arrive where we startedAnd know the place for the first time.

$review_text.: Photo and Video Suite X6 is two (totally independent) programs in one
 It is a money saving bundle if you need both

 It was very easy to install (but you have to install them twice, one at a time using different keys.)I already had another photo editing program (Adobe), and I quickly discovered that this one is just as good, but possibly a bit less intuitive
 But frankly I did not spend a lot of time with it
 Instead, I concentrated on the Video Suite; this is my first video editing software, and I was really excited to pound on it
 Unfortunately I was disappointed by how unintuitive it was in terms of making things work


 A real pro for video editing may find it a breeze, but that is not the case for a novice like myself

 (Keep in mind that I am a high-tech geek, I am no stranger to trying totally new software all the time.) After a while, I got so frustrated that I decided to bite the bullet and download the manual: it is nearly 250 pages!  (If you have to download a 250 page manual to make things work, something is wrong with the design of the user interface.)  The manual was definitely helpful, but it became clear to me that video editing is not something you can become good at in a few days

 I need to play with it for a lot longer to be able to do really neat things with it

 (It has so many nice features I would love to use, but learning them is a slow process.)I am going to rate Photo Suite 5-stars, and Video Suite only 3-stars, and I will average the two.

$review_text.: It's great to know that Pentax users don't need to spend a lot to get great quality optics. While the plastic no-frills build of this product may seem deceptively cheap, the end product is a lens that will complement any photographer's kit, whether beginner, hobbyist or professional.First, this lens is very light. The all-plastic construction means no extra weight, so carrying this lens around adds no noticeable bulk. It's also relatively compact for a 50mm lens, especially one that goes as wide as F1.8.Second, despite the plastic construction, the build tolerances of this lens are very tight. There's no slop anywhere, it just feels well-made. If the Pentax Limited lenses were made of plastic, they'd feel like this.And finally (or rather, most importantly), the optics in this lens are outstanding. This is a  similar lens formula that Pentax has used in previous very successful products, but updated with more advanced coatings to excel on a digital camera. Items in focus are tack sharp, and the bokeh is dreamy both in front of and behind the in-focus subject. Colors are beautifully retained, and scenes are given a pleasantly warm tone. The F1.8 max aperture means this lens is great for low-light photography.It's not all roses though. There are a few drawbacks to the budget build. This lens does not have any focus scale anywhere. And Pentax's "quick shift" feature that allows you to adjust focus manually after auto-focus is not present on this product. There's no lens hood or case included, either. This is about as no-frills as you can get. But considering the price and the quality of the optics, I guess some sacrifices had to be made.Also, auto-focus speed can be disappointing. This product uses a screw-drive mechanism driven by the camera rather than a built-in motor, so auto-focusing is noisy. And the mechanism has a LOT of travel to it (for high accuracy), which means there's a lot of turning to do to get from close-focus to infinity. It still takes less than half a second to make the whole trip, but it seems somewhat slower than most of my other screw-drive lenses. On the upside, close-focus distance is remarkably short which makes for great close-up capability, especially for a non-macro lens.I acquired this lens to complement a lightweight "hobbyist" kit alongside the DA 35mm F2.4 for my Pentax K-x camera, and it's succeeded brilliantly for that purpose. However my husband has been borrowing it frequently for his more advanced kit (a Pentax K-5 with a full range of Limited lenses) which he uses for formal occasions and organized shoots. So this lens is seeing a lot of use since we got it, and we couldn't be happier with the results.

My experience so far:Pros+ Nice industrial design+ Swivel feature is solid+ Convenient remote+ iPod docking (30/60/80 Gig video iPods) / SD Card reader (not tested)+ Dial controls for screen brightness and volume instead of push buttons. (You can change the volume on your kid's video without looking.)Cons- Screen resolution. If you're used to watching movies on your laptop computer, you will be disappointed with this and every other ~8" screen out there.  It's not the size so much, it's the lack of resolution, meaning you can see the pixels if you watching movies with this sitting on your lap.  To get into the $200 price range, they skimp on the screen.  I'm one of those folks who would pay extra for a hi-res 8" screen, but I can't find one yet.  I repeat: these screens are NOT laptop-quality screens.  Please go to a store and look at several models before you order online.- Battery life.  Rated at 2.5 hours. That's 1 movie on an airplane ride.  We bought this for the car, so it's not a big deal for us.  Just keep it in mind depending on your intended usage.- iPod dock.  Some of this may be a limitation of the iPod.  I'm not sure.  Here's what works for music:  play/pause music, track back/forward, fast forward/reverse.  What doesn't work:  displaying the track list on the screen and navigating the menus.  I'm not sure why someone would play music through this, though.  For photos:  starting/stopping the slide show, photo forward/back.  I didn't test videos, but I would guess the same controls as music would work.- The "manual" (really just a big sheet with several languages).  It's everything we've come to expect from electronic manufacturers.  There is no useful content for tweaking video settings, ipod limitations stated above, etc.  The only thing you need to know is that TV Out must be set to On in your iPod for the photos / videos to work.  Other than that, just experiment with the buttons.Bottom line, these portables are all pretty low-end at this screen size.  If you crave resolution, some of the manufacturers seem to put higher res screens in the bigger screen models. But then, it's not really a portable at that point, is it?  It's really more of a small laptop.

$review_text.: For my Canon G9, I tried Case Logic and Tamrac but didn't like the belt loops. Chose this case and it has served me well for 4+ years and 20+ hikes / trips / vacations. Fits the camera perfectly with 1/4" extra on the sides and 1/2" on the top along with extra battery (2 extra is a tight fit). Since I use wrist strap, the two zippers can meet in the middle (around the wrist strap).It has never opened up by itself as the zippers are snug when turning the corners at the top. I liked this case so much that I bought an spare. About a year ago, I left my camera somewhere - my buisiness card was in the front pocket and I got lucky and someone returned the camera, card, and battery - but the case wasn't returned. Been using my spare and now I'm buying another spare.It fits the G9 perfectly so when I replaced that camera with a Canon G12 (which is bigger) I thought I would have to look for a bigger case. I bought the Tamrac 5692 which fits perfectly but is 25% bigger than the Rezo 50 and IMHO too big to use on the belt. The G12 does fit in the Rezo 50 but it is a really snug fit especially with an extra battery (forget about 2 extras). I still use this case when I want my G12 on my belt.

$REVIEW.: One obstacle I had to overcome when reviewing the ArcLight Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Case ($52.95 List/currently $29.95 on Amazon) was the fact that I've been using theLogitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover Mini for iPad mini - Black (920-005021)($79.99 List/currently $69 on Amazon) for the past two months


 This is like comparing diamonds to cubic zirconia.Therefore, to make it fair, I'm going to tell you what I like about the ArcLight and what I don't


What you spend on a Keyboard Case is up to you
Everyone knows that, in general, you get what you pay for; and this is true for electronics, as well.1


The Case: The case is fairly substantial when you consider it is made from some sort of plastic, and it will probably stand up under light-to-normal wear and tear

 The case provides easy access to all the ports of the iPad, and you don't have to take it out of the case to charge it


It has a really neat feature of a rotating backrest so you can view your iPad either horizontal or vertical

This is great for reading and playing games
I don't know of any other keyboard case that makes it this easy


(Note: look at the photos on the instruction manual to see how to adjust the backrest
You'll never figure it out, otherwise!) What I didn't like about the case is that it's extremely difficult to open without the iPad in it
It took me a several tries to get it open, even after several tries

I did discover that it's easier to open once the iPad is in the case


That's a good thing, because it's even harder to get off! I even got my hand stuck for a while trying to get it off
 (The instructions didn't help much on this


It's just really stuck.)2


Pairing: Pairing was a cinch! So easy - just turn it on, turn on your iPad's Bluetooth, enter a code and it's done.3

The Keys: Because the iPad Mini is so small, any keyboard you buy will also be small

Therefore, manufacturers tend to eliminate some of the keys and move others around to accommodate this small space
On the ArcLight, however, most of the keys are there and in the right location
The only major differences are the brackets, question mark, quote marks, apostrophe, and lines
(These keys are combined with other letters and require the use of the fn key.) The ArcLight includes an option and command key on both sides of the space bar, and it has arrow keys in the right place

The delete key is bigger than most other keyboard cases, which is nice

However, because it retains these keys, the space bar is much smaller, the keys are smaller and have less space between them than other keyboards


This makes touch-typing awkward, if not impossible


I honestly don't think a person with large fingers could do touch-typing on this unit


However, if you have small fingers or prefer to use the hunt and peck method, you should be able to adjust to the keyboard


For me, I use the question mark and apostrophe frequently and found the use of the fn key too frustrating.4


The Bottom Line: IF you're on a budget, the ArcLight may meet your needs
(You might want to try typing on it first to make sure your fingers will fit the keyboard.) It's certainly worth the price as advertised on Amazon


However, if you have a bigger budget, I recommend you buy the LogicTech.

$REVIEW.: These plug adapters seem perfect.  They look really strange, apparently because they are trying to be a universal outlet for any type of plug.  U.S. electrical plugs fit perfectly.  They are a hard plastic material that should be very durable.  No weird angles like some adapters that make it harder to plug directly into the outlet.  I haven't yet traveled to St. Lucia with them, so I can't testify that they will work, but all one has to do is match the PROPER outlet with the country.  I intend to use them to charge iPad, phone, kindle, etc.  No hairdryers, curling irons, toasters, microwaves, etc.  The right product for the job!

$REVIEW.: I just got back my first roll of film shot with my LOMO and i was really really surprised with the results

The pics shot in decent lighting were crisp, cleat, and downright cool looking


I was really plesed with the results I got shooting black and white


I've been taking photos for 46 yrs shooting a variety of cameras and consider myseld a semi-pro

Bottom line with this camera if you expect the same results as shooting medium formator 35mm in a "real" camera or with a decent digital camera forget it
But if you want to have fun shooting "outside the box" give the LOMO Fisheye a try.Its FUN! Film is fun - going back to my roots.Pros: It's fun.Filters will thread onto the lens, just be careful - I believe the size it takes is 46mm.Cons: As previously covered occasionaly the film rewind know does pop up and yes it can drag when advancing or rewinding film

be careful and anvance and rewind slowly.Yes the lens cap does pop off - be careful.

$REVIEW.: Please Guys, use this gateway on the Internet provider it was designed to work with. After spending close to $200 dollars on a router and modem setup, that not even lasted me 3 years, I decided to go the Cheapo route.After reading all the reviews (good and bad) decided to give it a try. the price was right and I could always return it.After connecting it,  the Charter network recognized the new piece of hardware, after a few questions, it was up and running.The wireless signal is as good as in my old router and I love it so much that I bought another as a spare.It's a basic piece of hardware without all the bells and whistles, but who fiddles with their gateway after you have it set up? I don't!Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: This product was easy to set up and worked fine the first time around.  I had a leased modem for a long time and finally got around to a purchase.  I have Comcast and this is one they validate will work with their system.  I didn't even have to call them for the setup as their automated program recognized I had changed modems and asked me for pertinent information online during my setup.  This made everything easy.  I'm sure they do this with any modems but it did work easily nevertheless.  I have a raised ranch and extended porch and have had no problem getting wireless access anywhere in my house, including my porch.  I thought it was a good deal for a good price.

$review_text.: I do like this case, it does swivel into a reading position which is why I bought this case. It does provide good protection and it looks ok.It does have a few issues though:1. The cover is very thick and adds a lot of bulk, as does the material on the back that creates the swiveling rest.2. The pivot is very loose. It takes a while to get used to, especially if you like to fold the cover behind your device to hold it it your hand.3. On my particular case, there feels like an object sandwiched under the lining of the cover, in one of the grooves. It is just an irritating bump that makes the tablet sit crooked.4. The edging around the device screen is bumpy and uneven. It was jagged in one spot when it arrived, but I have tried to push it in so many times it's now loose.5. The elastic strap for holding the cover closed is sewn in crooked.It just seems the quality is a bit poorer than I would expect, but it was inexpensive and it does the job.

$review_text.: This was a cool gift idea, and it works...sort of as advertised.  I would give it 5 stars, but...here are the limitations...it is noisy on two of three fixed frequencies that it transmits on.  I had the impression, for some reason that one could manually fine tune these frequency choices -- that is not so.  When you turn on or off the car, with the unit plugged in, and the stereo on, it makes a very loud series of noises that are less than musical.  The sound quality is good, not great.  Background noise and a very limited bandwidth seem to render its clarity well below the listening experience of the IPOD headphones.  Also, the volume level seems to be a good bit below that of the radio, so if you switch from the IPOD back to standard FM, that will be a blast!  Finally, the digital frequency display on the power adaptor is faint to the point of being nearly useless.  It does have high quality construction, and the cigarette lighter/accessory power adaptor is especially well made, with a nice red light showing when there is power.  The cables and connectors are also of excellent quality, and despite the negatives, it has been a delight to be able to transport my favorite road music into my Volvo while doing the field service drives that can be pretty long and boring, and where radio signals just plain fizzle out.  It's not audiophile, but it does a decent job and I would still recommend it as a gift or for anyone who wants to hear their IPOD over their car stereo with minimal fuss.

$review_text.: easy to set up and install. I don't understand why people pay 10 times the price for other TV mounts... the security screws aren't necessary.I suppose if you are very concerned about making the TV perfectly level you might want a stand with an adjustable side after the base mount is put on the wall. in other words, when you install this mount, you have to have it level on the wall. I have seen some other mounts where you can make those adjustments on a crooked (mount) that's installed.if you're OK with that buy this mount for sure.I mounted mine to a concrete wall using a hammer drill, no issues. HDMI cable was a nice bonus item, works just fine.

$REVIEW.: When I first got this screen cover for my NEX3-NL, it worked great. I felt super comfortable handling the camera in a way I hadn't before, for fear of damaging the LCD.And then I caught the camera as it was about to fall off a table someone ran into, and in that catch, the screen protector came loose. From that point forward, it would not seal to the camera again. I didn't know that, though, until I went to use the camera and the protector slid off of it and, you guessed it, scratched the holy hell out of my LCD lens. This is not okay. I am soooo disappointed.There are, however, no other viable screen protectors out there, so I am ordering another one. The screen is already scratched, so what am I protecting? I'm not sure, but I am going to try to prevent it from being worse than it is.I paid ~$14 for it. It was great until it really, really wasn't.

I received the SSD drive within a few days of ordering it, and installed it onto my laptop right away.  I just took the other HDD out, and replaced it with the SSD.  It did have a cable so that I could clone my HDD to my SSD, but most websites that I read stated it would be best to do a 'Clean' installation.  I had windows 7 Ultimate up and running within a little over forty five minutes or so.  It turned my computer into a super computer.  It is faster than I ever could imagine.  It starts up in about thirteen seconds and you can run numerous programs right from the get go, instantaneously.  I am amazed.  I never knew that the HDD was slowing my computer down that much.  I even had to do a firmware update already and was sweating it thinking that I would loose everything I just accomplished and have to start over from scratch, but NOPE, it went very smoothly and all I had to do was download the update and crucial took care of the rest.  I can't say enough about the preformance boost you will get from your present computer by just installing a SSD drive.  I heard all the hub-bub, and thought it was just that, hub-bub.  Boy, was I wrong.  Fast, Reliable, and dependable with great support from crucial.  I will be buying more from this seller again, and give them top ratings.

I like that it is a stand also. Good for the price for sure. Only thing more perfect would be if it were a 360 rotating case.
$review_summary.: Does the job well

$REVIEW.: This is my second pair of SOL REPUBLIC HD Tracks. I so enjoyed my first pair that I let my Son use them for a day just to try out. Needless to say I didn&#8217;t get them back so I ordered another set in a different color.Fit: Very comfortable after easily being adjusted to my head and ears. This was my first move prior to plugging these guys in. I found them then and now after a number of months holding their shape for a perfect fit every time I put them on.Sound: Clear sound is the word here along with a very fine bass if you choose so. I&#8217;ve played these through my stereo system, laptop, tablet and Ipod. I&#8217;ve adjusted every sound adjustment on each form high levels (which I don&#8217;t recommend) to lower levels. The sound quality remained clear and enjoyable.Quality: I believe just by feel these guys are every well made. Durable while not being as heavy s others I&#8217;ve owned. The head band is simply indestructible.My son and I would both recommend these SOL&#8217;s. Of course as I always do read the STAR ratings, make a positive and negative list, check price and buy them.Amazon consistently at my time of purchase had best price. That couple with prime delivery is well worth a look.

$REVIEW.: I was considering taking off a star for dull color but at last decided against it. I always loved Speck case, and think Speck makes the best i-devices cases. I have cases for my old iPod and iPad 3 that have been on them from the beginning (years!). Some sign of wear, but still works and function like new. They don't add too much bulk to the iPad either and these were the reason I switched cases sometimes but always came back to Speck.This one is the same, except a little bulkier than the others. Still fits like glove, all openings are at the right places and feels nicely secured. Front cover put the iPad to sleep when close and folded just like the Apple case so you can adjust to different viewing angles. This one came with hooks in the back that you can hook to your car head rest to allow using the iPad from the back seat. The hooks are attached to elastic strips so you can hook the case to different width of head rest.The only thing that could make this case better is if it comes in more colors!
$review_summary.: Excellent iPad case with road trip feature.

$REVIEW.: I upgraded my Sapphire Radeon HD 5750 to the Gigabyte Radeon HD 7870.  The Gigabyte 7870 is a very large card.  It barely fit on Antec Nine Hundred Two case.  Initially, I had my Sapphire 5750 in the first PCIe x16 slot (nearest to the CPU).  However, I had to find another x16 PCIe slot because the Gigabyte 7870 was so long that it pushed against my HDD cables.  As others have mentioned, the card is very cool and quiet.  The Gigabyte OC tool also has a monitoring feature that allows you to observe the temperature, clock frequency, voltage, fan speed, etc., of the GPU.

$REVIEW.: I cant walk and can only use my right arm. I use a powerchair and wanted to video like a dolly or one of those fancy hollywood camera dolly vehicals. Took me a year, but found the solution. not only can I smoothly dolly and truck. I can also pan and tilt. All while I drive my hoverond one handed. This device made it happen. I use my right hand to drive and control the remote for the head. On the left arm rest I useePhoto Premium DSLR Rig Movie Kit Shoulder Rig Mountwhich I configured to sit on and wrap around the left armrest of my chair. if you have removable footrest you can attach the front arm of the rig to the footrest nipple withPromaster 3/8" to 1/4" Tripod Thread Adapter (3 Pack)I placed a blank cd (for traction) between the rig and the head. Being a retired photographer Im amazed at how smooth this setup is. Ive usedSony HVR-HD1000U Digital High Definition HDV Camcorderand aNikon D5100Some of the footage just amazes me at how slick and smooth it is. This head is a smooth operator. Pimp out this setup even more, and youll certainly look bigtime. Even if your not handicapped like I am borrow a power chair and try, you will be amazed! Also, because because its hard to see the fold out lcd in daylight on the camera... I useHoodman HD-300VIDEO Hood for 2.5-Inch to 3-Inch 16x9 HD LCD ScreensNow youve got a serious filmaking tool. I addedPro Battery Grip for Nikon D5100to my dslr and a matte box. and the head still functions great.

I bought 12 total and have them on my shelf, they blend right in!  I love them.  They hold 48, but you can easily fit 2 more sleeves in each case if needed, I bough at extra package of sleeves to do this whenever I bought more movies.Each book has an outside tab I labeled mine 1-12 and I keep a DVD list on excel.

$REVIEW.: Our son has just started his sophomore year in a sprawling apartment he's sharing with three others.  For some reason, picking up a wi-fi signal was a problem in some areas of their living space.  With the installation of TP-LINK TL-WA850RE 300Mbps Universal Wi-Fi Range Extender, that is no longer a problem anywhere in their suite of rooms.  They all have a sturdy signal for their various study, ahem, needs.  I'm told game play is also strong.  I like the clean, smallish design, the range extender button (not sure why it is not always "on").  I am thinking of getting one for our home.  Mainly to extend our wireless network into the shaded, park-like far corners of our yard!  Recommended.

$review_text.: Ill get to the quality but first a back story:Ive had my boss for awhile, I had two pairs of noise canceling and they were great

I'm in the Army so I used them on planes and buses

I got these about 2 weeks ago and I'm impressed! The Beats headphones never sounded that great for the price but I see so many people wearing them out looking rediculous, but for me I used them on a trip to Euro Disney on the bus yesterday, and in bed with the iPad while wifey is asleep and on the laptop


I also used them with my Astro wireless MixAmp for shits and giggle and they sounded beast with all the bass


My boss for some reason sounded horrible on the MixAmp even though they sounded good with everything else.So quality:They sound clear and with bass you can feel
Not over powering but like your listening to a good sound system

I use them for movies and they sound natural (not over powering bass) and with music


For me they don't get that loud, I think it's maybe cause the drivers (speakers) are so big
Music is great, I played with my preset EQ on the MacBook and iPhone and Electronic or Piano sound best.Build: Fantastic, both my Boss over time, the frame has needed repairs, not a problem cause Boss has great customer service but something I didn't know until I got these is that the speakers come off the frame, the frame is one piece and the speakers can be unplugged so they can be dissembled
For warrenty and repairs this seems awesome, plus I can let someone listen in by pulling a speaker of like I did for my son on the bus

No I haven't needed any repairs or customer service so I can't review or talk about that which to me that's the biggest part of a product is knowing the company trust their product and has your back.Sorry for so long, I never read long reviews but wanted to give my two cents like all products I buy and if your reading this I give it a 4.5 out of 5 and it's a definite buy

I wish they could be a little louder on my iPhone and MacBook.P.S

the cord is perfect length so you don't have to tie extra cord or something.

$REVIEW.: Garmin support is top notch but the nuvi, and from further research all Garmin product line all have the problems I'm seeing in the 1450.I guess I'm just use to my Mov....very user friendly...but support sucks.Now for the Garmin problems.  Trip information (ie time to arrival, time left, miles left, etc) not readily available on map have to touch the screen 3 times to see direction then touch the screen 3 times to see time remaining in trip then touch the screen to see distance remaining...Mov is all right on the screen with one touch.Second....Trip from San Diego to San Luis Obispo CA...route computed was great to a point - then started taking state routes instead of interstates.  In one section it took us down a 2 land highway, SR154, at 45MPH through canyons and cliffs.  It diverted us off the Interstate 110 to do this side trip, not our choosing...we did not select avoid highways as was suggested by Garmin support.  Then once out of this 45MPH maze it connected back to Interstate 110.  I tried setting every option to avoid that route.  No way.  I could not tell the unit to avoid that route.  I could avoid a section of a trip on my Mov and it would select another route.Another short trip to a Ralphs easily found on the GPS grocery stores....took us 3 miles out of the way avoiding the most obvious route.  The freeeway.  But it would find the correct route for the IHOP across the street from the Ralphs....go figure.Garmin customer service...very quick to help....reload programs and maps...same problem persists.  Now they want to replace the unit...Garmin products are very limited in letting the user provide direction in to the route they want to travel.  Ie distance - longest to shortest in increment from 1-5.  Shortest to longer times in increment from 1-5.I was pleased with the ease of the Garmins desktop software.  Worked very well, easy to use and update maps, unit software  and what ever - very effecfective.  That's the down fall of the Mov - the desktop software is misserable.The Garmin traffic worked very well.  While I watched the traffic come to a standstill on I5 and 405 while moving from S to N through San Diego I was manuvering side streets.If Garmin can allow the user to AVOID traffic with a touch of the screen you think they would allow you to avoid a 2 lane state hiway with a touch of the screen.

They (you need at least 2) are easy to install and are not influenced by any other electronic devices in the house (I also have some X10 controlled devices). They even work across legs of the house power, which the X10 will not do. I have tested the speed, and they are as fast as being connected directly to the cable modem. The data is encrypted for privacy. I'd recommend these to anyone desiring to set up a home network who do not want to run cables or depend on the vagueries of wireless.

$REVIEW.: I set these up in adjacent rooms (that share a wall). For some reason, the transmission only works every other time I use my remote button. I end up mashing the buttons 3-4 times before it registers. Not sure if it's my walls (i.e.- the range of this device), or some other issue. I've also used the Radioshack product, which is awful- that one pauses for 1 minute every time you start using it. This X10 product seems to need to 'wake up' every time you press a remote button- so it's not much better. I guess these wireless ones only work if they're in the same room, and maybe in constant use. Anyway, I'm going to try the wired version of IR repeaters.

I can read in bed with it or stand it up at the kitchen table and read hands free while I eat.  I can view in landscape and portrait mode and I have unlimited choice of viewing angles.  It provides excellent protection when I travel.  The leather looks very good.  Mine is red.  The stitching is well done.  It has a very expensive look and feel to it.  When I decided to try it I did not know how successful I would be at getting a book light that I could use with it.  The Kandel II works just fine.  The rooCASE adds weight to the Kindle so that it feels like the weight of a medium size paperback book.  I do not mind this as there are so many positives.  I also like that I can pop out the Kindle from the zippered case and hold it in just the part that encases the Kindle. All operations are easy from inserting the Kindle into the inner case to popping it free from the outer case (which is secured by velcro). Nice to see such a well made product.
$SUMMARY.: Well designed,  well executed Kindle cover & stand.

$review_text.: When you compare GPS systems there is a big range in price and features. I chose the Neo for its low cost and basic functionality. It was right for me, but my friend who has more disposable income as a Skycaddy that he loves.Advantage of the Neo: It is one of the smallest units out there, very simple to operate, easy to read, low cost, you do not have to continually subscribe - once you download a course it is yours for ever.  You can map your own courses or add GPS points to existing courses easily.  You can measure a shot distance.  The display works well even in direct sunlight.Disadvantage:  You need to advance holes manually and the indicator of what hole you are on is fairly small, it is black and white, only holds 10 downloaded courses at a time, some courses that you might expect to be one download are actually two because the course lists them as separate 9 hole courses. The belt holster it comes with is kind of cheap so I just use my cell phone belt holster.I find it most helpful at courses that don't display their distance markers well or courses with undulating fairways where it is more difficult to judge distance.  I also appreciate it for the range from 50 to 100.  Of its features the ones you use most are distance to Center, Front, Back; the rest is fluff.

It takes a few tries to learn how to put them on and off.( kind of place the clip over your ear at the top and "roll" them into place) These do well for working in the yard, walking, and bicycling

$REVIEW.: I wanted a relatively inexpensive way to individually store my lenses since the camera bag I use only allows me to take out 2 lenses at a time.  They're nice, thick pouches.  I wouldn't want to drop the lens or anything since the pouch doesn't afford that much protection.  But, it keeps it safe from dust and gives it some cushion.  I even use a pouch for the extra lens in my bag.  It definitely helps there to make sure the lens is secure and safe.  I just love these pouches.This small size is great for my Canon ef-s 60mm f/2.8 macro lens.

All button presses are solid and reaffirming.After a couple of years of use, this keyboard is headed in the same direction as the one before it: all the letters are rubbed off

Why manufacturers can not build a basic, no-frills, keyboard with paint that lasts more than a year is beyond me.

$review_text.: I would have preferred a single piece back.  The two piece back doesn't fit square together, the sides are beveled so it bows out against the wall.  In addition the bolts they give you to hold it together don't have any lock washers so the loosen up.  I had to put some plastic spacers between the two pieces to sit flush and put some loctite on the screws holding the two brackets together.  Other than that it does the job for the money, but if it's your first time buying a bracket look for a single piece bracket on the wall as it will be much easier to install.Also as with any bracket make sure you have drill bits to drill pilot holes and an impact drill driver to for the bolts otherwise you'll have a hard time installing them into wood studs.  no drill bits are included.

$review_text.: I won't get into the technical specs of this little guy b/c many netbooks have the same 'guts' and this one follows suit. I WIll tell you that, as a student who likes to study at coffee shops, cafes, and other places where tabletop space is at a premium, this netbook fits the bill. I was using an iBook G4 14.4" laptop, and as much as I loved it, I decided to look for something more...petite. This netbook doesn't come to you with a lot of bloatware, which is cool. Personally, I deleted the MacAfee (sp?) trial, and downloaded Avast! free online, and it takes up minimal amounts of memory to run. I also downloaded MS Office 2007, which runs well.As for the hardware - the screen is beautiful when its at full brightness (like when plugged into a wall outlet). However, to eek out the best battery life, I turn it down fairly low. The legibility is still quite good, however. Speaking of battery life - I can easily get 8 hours out of this when I use the installed battery life manager tool. I really love that when outlets are scarce. And the battery charges up fairly quickly too. The keyboard is 93% the size of a regular one, and I find it to be quite generous. The TAB key is a little tiny, but that's nit-picky stuff.There was also an initial problem with the netbook connecting to a public wireless network, but I plugged in the ethernet cable at home and downloaded the appropriate drivers. All's well now, and I can connect anywhere with no problems.The computer does come with a little cloth sleeve, but its a joke. I purchased aTargus CityGear Netbook Case for up to 10.2 Inch Netbooks- Black and Grey TSM097USto carry the wireless optical mouse, the power adapter/cords and a few pens and papers with the computer around campus. Very good investment (this Samsung fits in the sleeve snugly, but not too tightly).Sorry if this review doesn't pick apart the technicalities of the device - plenty of other reviews can cover that topic better than I. This is a nice, solid netbook with a great battery life, and it will serve you well. Happy surfing!
$review_summary.: Excellent Netbook for Students - A few WiFi hiccups, though.

I immediately assumed a lens or body issue, but after much trouble shooting it ended up being the battery.  I would reset the camera, pull the battery, put it back in and it would stop autofocusing after a while.  After I put a real Nikon battery in, the problem went away.Oh well, I guess it's back to all real Nikon batteries.  These aren't worth the headaches.

These are digital cables and the '1' or '0' will either get there or not which is more a function of the connector.  Once the connector and connection is good (and these are solid), the $4 digital cable will the same audio and video qality as the $100 one.At $5.49 for the single cable and free shipping, you will either lose or little OR save a lot.

I ordered and received this drive in 2 days (thank you Amazon Prime free shipping) on December 28th, 2010.I mirrored my current drive, something I've been needing to do for a long time, and am now using this drive as my main drive (the old drive is now a backup). I also purchased a Quad Core CPU and I have to say that the installation and performance of this drive and my other purchase are blazing fast and I'm VERY happy with them. I plan on picking up 1 or 2 more of these Hard drives as backups and extra game/video/picture space.You can't beat the speed, reliability, and price.I also recommend any of you out there with important pictures or video get an online backup service...even for JUST those items. If all your drives failed suddenly, your online backups should still be there for you.*For the gamers out there, this drive is plenty fast. I'm running Metro 2033, Crysis, and Mass Effect 2 absolutely maxed out and this drive has ZERO trouble moving data for a flawless experience. (you need the GPU/CPU to compliment it, but I just want to reassure anyone that may question gaming performance across these huge drives)

You can read my detailed reviews athttp://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MYNT7BUPG4FJ/ref=ya_26?ie=UTF8&sort;_by=MostRecentReviewbut in summary:Canon SX260HS did nice on the photos but lacked modern useful features like in camera panorama and 3D photos.Sony DSC HX20V was an improvement over HX9V but was thicker and bulkier than the competition, with an awkward charging position, a relatively difficult to use Panorama mode and didn't cleanly terminate videos.Samsung WB750 had a defective screen coating, an annoying processing delay before photos got saved and lousy customer service.Nikon Coolpix S9100 didn't focus well in low light.Casio Ex ZR100 had poor image stabilization and Casio seems to now have dropped off from the race for compact superzoom's.Compared to the all the other brands I didn't find any flaw in the Panasonic making me want to return it

The camera is very sturdy and slim (1.1") for a 20x zoom
You get a very wide angle 24mm Leica lens and the Power OIS works well allowing you to use the 20x optical zoom


The camera takes nice photos and videos overall and panorama mode works great
Touchscreen is an added bonus.Now I'm eagerly awaiting the Panasonic ZS25/ZS30 coming out in 2013 April.

$REVIEW.: I bought these speakers for my laptop because the speakers on it sounded so bad. At my laptops lowest volume setting these speakers are really loud. I like that these speakers just plug into the USB and work. My only complaint is that the cable gets tangled easily. If they were wireless like a USB wireless mouse, that would be great. I also think they sound pretty good with music, but I bought them for talk shows, so they sound great. I don't have any issues with annoying sounds when the speakers are not being used. I would definitely recommend these speakers.

$review_text.: Like somebody else already said, this device is rendered fairly obsolete by free cloud services like Dropbox and Box.com

Here are some pros and cons.Pros:- The device is small and is super easy to set up

Just plug it into your router, into a power supply, and that's it

Go to their website and they'll automatically detect it on your network and then you just create a log-in and you're good to go.- It is really way easier initially to just plug a storage device into the Pogoplug if you have a lot of files or a very large file rather than waiting for your stuff to upload to a cloud service (more on that in the cons).- It has apps for your portable devices that are fairly easy to navigate (Android at least).- It is very easy to share content


Just click a file from your gallery and you can generate a link or do social media sharing

On the app if you click to send a link it'll give you all the standard phone/tablet sharing options (e.g
messaging, email, Twitter, etc.).- It organizes your media into photos, music, videos, etc
which is good.Cons:- To begin with, the power adapter is huge
If you're using a power strip you'll take up two spaces since the adapter will partially cover whatever is next to it.- You have to plug the device into your router


While this makes sense from the standpoint of it always being on, it is a pain if your router is not right next to you or even in another room
This means that anything that you want to plug into it you will have to leave your computer to do so; imagine this from the standpoint of plugging in an external hard drive that you normally have plugged into your computer

Now you will need to go back and forth between when you want to use your hard drive with your computer and when you want to use it with the Pogoplug, unless you feel like bellying up to more than the free 5GB of cloud storage that they give you (anything above that costs a monthly fee).- I just found it to be incredibly slow

From the web interface I would wait 5-10 seconds for a file to come up after clicking on it


This may be acceptable if you are looking at one or two things, but if you have a large gallery then it sucks


It also takes FOREVER to generate thumbnails, so if you have a lot of pictures, I hope you don't plan on sharing them right away

You may want to go play a game of Monopoly while you wait
This goes for the app as well, except you cannot access stuff at all until it is finished processing through the Pogoplug

At least on the web you can force it to open by just clicking it open; on the app it will not work period until it's finished.- It is easier and in some cases faster to just use free cloud services than the Pogoplug.Overall, I would suggest you just use something like Dropbox or Box.com unless you anticipate having ENORMOUS files or huge file sizes

It is easier, faster in many cases, and obviously cheaper
There are certainly some benefits to Pogoplus and it does have its utilities, but really...I can't imagine why I'd want to use this when I can just use Dropbox.


$SUMMARY.: It is a decent product, but is it the right choice for you?

$review_text.: Super, incredibly plush! I was truly impressed with how tactile this case is. I have seen similar items with "quilting" that have a rough feel or merely have the appearance of being "quilted." However, this case is genuinely "puffy" and "squishable"! (The bonus here is that this acts as a bit of additional cushioning for your Kindle). And, not only does it feel fantastic, it looks gorgeous. Moreover, while it seems impossible, this is not at all bulky ... it fits very nicely into my messenger bag.Oddly, I prefer cases with the elastic straps that hold the Kindle in-place. I know that they will eventually loss elasticity and probably have a shorter lifespan than this type ... both I often find that these "snap-in-place" type are a little less sturdy and maybe a little rough on the Kindle itself. This is (perhaps) simply a personal preference. Nonetheless, the interior is very soft and will easily protect against scratches.Aesthetically speaking, I'm not wild about the magnetic strap ... it think gives the case a bit of an old-school Day-Planner look. But, this is a minor "complaint" about and overall lovely product.This case is the perfect marriage of playful yet conservative. (The strange silver man in the bottom corner of case may prohibit it from the workplace, so purchase accordingly. I have seen this symbol in much more subtle ways on Belkin products, but on this standing case, it is really, REALLY noticeable).I have this case in both cream and black. The black is really lovely, but the cream is incredibly sophisticated. If you see these on sale here, maybe considering getting both.

$review_text.: Perhaps ten years ago, a video camera pen would have been more impressive. Nowadays, it would take a really technologically clueless individual to be fooled by this "Covert" security device from Defender-USA, a company that sells a wide variety of security/surveillance products.Likes:Looks like a regular pen, works like a regular pen.Records 640x480 @25 frames/sec .AVI videos and 1280x1024 .JPEG photos.PC and Mac compatible.Connects to computer like a 4GB USB flash drive.Charges via USB in about an hour.Uses are only limited by one's imagination! Examples: workers goofing around, places such as museums and factories where there are no videos/photos allowed, photo of the blind date your pal set you up with (could be good OR bad), etc.Dislikes:Battery life only about an hour.Picture quality dependent on adequate lighting.Grainy videos and below average photos; hard to get sharp pictures up close such as documents with small print.Difficult to capture subject accurately; aim pinhole camera in subjects' general direction and height and hope it's recorded within the frame.No audio in accordance with government regulations.Pricey at $49.99; mini video cams with higher res. and audio are readily available at lower prices even though less discreet than this pen.Overall:Fun for the youngsters and those easily fascinated by technology.Obsolete/inadequate for real-world or corporate espionage (even the eyeglasses video cam from M:I (1996) was more imaginative/advanced).

$REVIEW.: It was time to update an old surge protector I'd bought with a PC in 2006, and this sleek white protector filled the bill. My old unit still had in/output for phone cords! This surge protector is solidly constructed, white with a grey edge, and mounting slots on the back. The cord and unit look quite nice in a white room. The liability is $250,000, a huge step up from the old version.I plugged this in to the wall, untangled a glob of cords, and plugged them in to the new surge protector; I was also delighted to find two USB outlets, each 2.1 amps. My iPad got one, the iPhone took the second. There is plenty of room for power blocks, a recessed on/off switch, and lights that indicate "power" and "grounded." I'm glad to see the cords so attractively managed, but even more pleased to know that my equipment is properly protected.

I should also add it can only do web site passwords and not program passwords such as: VPN, Remote Desktop etc.Will post update once I get a response form their support e-mail. For now I would NOT recommend this product.I read other reviews and found out that sure enough this company is doing the classic bait and switch. Pay us a yearly fee to use the hardware! Here is a thought NO. Going to return this item...a real joke of a product. Yearly fees are for anti-virus. See the concept is you get new anti-virus definitions all the time. Hmmm, are they going to send me new fingers every year. What exactly does the yearly fee pay for...oh ya them making profit for no work.

The battery is not the same as the factory battery- it is a 9-cell instead of 6-cell. Because of that, it has an extension that raises the laptop up about half an inch. It angles the laptop a little, but isn't a big deal. This battery is still a great alternative to paying more for a battery from Dell!

$REVIEW.: I truly love these headphones for style

 They are a little bulky but you can tell that style was high on the designer's list

 I have been using a pair of Sennheiser headphones exclusively and I feel that the sound on these are a little crisper and the sound canceling is comparable
 I have no complaints at all on the corded sound these produce
 I'm a little less happy with the Bluetooth which works well when close to the bluetooth source and have a line of sight between the two
 These work beautifully when listening to books on tape on walks - perhaps a little too well and cutting me off from the environment.I do wish they would fold up a little smaller, so Sennheiser will continue to be my traveling headphones, but these have found a place wired to my computer for late night music and video enjoyment
The price is a little high for dedicated wired headphones though.

$review_text.: I found this headset to be one of the best for the price I have found.Pros: Paired easily with my Galaxy Note 2. Took about 8 seconds to set it up and pair it. Light, simple and charge holds for a long time.Cons: Doesn't fit tightly in hear, causing the ear piece to sit a little far from where it should, making volume seem somewhat faint. I list a fix for this below.  Button placement is inconvenient for those with large hands/fingers.Really can't beat the price for this Bluetooth Headset. Charge holds a long time and I have only charged it twice in the past two weeks. I only use it while I drive so it doesn't get tremendous use.As the headset is rather loose using the behind the ear clip (comes with clip for left or right ear) and the ear piece is a bit too large in my opinion, it doesn't set right in my ear.  I have a pair of ear buds that came with my Galaxy Note II that I just took one of the spare rubber covers for the ear piece and put it on the ear piece of the headset and it improved sound quality to the point I can actually turn down the volume as it focuses the sound directly into my ear.I have seen other comments on here about the non-stop voice saying when it connects or powers up. I only hear it once and if it bothers you, you can follow instructions to turn that feature off. I don't find it bothersome at all.Also, I am not sure why they bother to include the little ear holders in case you don't want to behind-the-ear clip. They don't fit my ear at all and are useless. Maybe they may work on a smaller ear, but can't imagine it's secure enought to stay in.

$REVIEW.: Well, I took a chance on this product because in the past I have had Netgear products that have performed very well and I bought it refurbished which meant it only cost $48.It worked very well for the 13 months since I got it leading up till today. Wired was perfect, wireless it would lose it's signal occasionally but not enough to really bother me and the range was very good (I could take my laptop pretty far outside my apartment and still get a signal)Today I woke up and the router was no longer working, the green power light was the only thing on. I could not connect to the router via my computer and the router was obviously not connecting to my cable modem. I switched out all the cables to make sure the cables were not the problem and connected my modem straight to my computer to make sure it was not a problem with my ISP or my network card (I'm now writing this review on that connection so obviously the ISP and my network card are fine) As a last resort I tried the "Restore Factory Settings" button on the back which did nothing. The modem was kept on my desk in a well ventilated area and was basically not physically touched for the year I had it except the few times I had to restart it (maybe once every 4 months)If you are looking for a product you can depend on do not buy this router. I have used other company's routers in the past and its sad that you can't depend on any single company since the quality of brands and models seems to vary all over the place.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this tablet a few days before several weeks of travel. I basically purchased this one since I had also switched to a Windows 8 phone and felt pretty comfortable with that interface. I also wanted a tablet that I could run the full versions of MS Office and some other Windows software. I did purchase a cover with a bluetooth keyboard which combined with the pen makes it even better. The first few trips I took this tablet along with my laptop and an iPad mini for entertainment. After trying it out in a variety of office, hotel, and plane situations, I pretty much only take this tablet and leave the laptop at home unless I know I am going to be in a situation where I need the laptop and all its ports. The tablet does everything I need, weighs less, and takes up much less space though I do still throw in the mini for entertainment. It is a little challenging to work on the smaller screen, but the benefits far outweigh that challenge. I have connected the WiFi at home, in several hotels, conference centers, and through the hotspot on my phone - all have worked without any issues and in places where iPads have dropped connections.  Having a full size usb port and the ability to add in a microSD card are big pluses. The battery life has been long enough for how I use it over a day.  If you are looking for a Windows 8 (not RT) tablet, I believe you would be hard pressed to find a better one these days.

$review_text.: I bought this last week at Best Buy after reading tons of reviews of various NEX and Micro 4/3 cams


I have previously owned a Canon D20 full-size DSLR, a Canon S100 semi-pro compact, and another Canon "Elph" compact
The S100 is the Camera which I have previously used the most


It has a bigger sensor than most compacts of that 2009-era, and a fast lens

I have rarely used my DSLR because it is too large and you look like a wanna-be camera geek dragging it around.The photos from this Sony are impressive

Color is great


Exposure is spot-on
It takes decent shots even at high ISOs (up to 1600 look very sharp)
Movies look incredible

It records truly DSLR-grade photos
My DSLR is dated
It won't sound like much saying that it takes better photos than my Canon D20, but, wow

It has twice the pixels as the D20 but takes in just as much light


What an amazing upgrade.Honestly, I expected quality photos
I have read enough pro reviews of other NEX cameras with the same sensor to know that this camera is great at recording beautiful images


What I did not expect is how great the "auto" modes on this camera are

This camera's skill at automatically choosing the right settings for you is why you should buy it.I never studied photography in school, but I have read enough, and have enough consumer experience to know how to balance aperture, speed, and ISO to get great shots

Because I'm not an experienced or pro photographer, setting everything on the camera has always been a bit trial-and-error


I've forced myself to do this chore because I always end up with better shots than most camera's "auto" modes


Well, if you're an amateur like me you may find yourself proudly turning the mode dial to the "superior auto" mode on this Sony
Unless you're a pro, this camera is great at quickly analyzing a scene and choosing the ideal settings
I still love to tinker when I have time, but it is invaluable to be able to turn the mode to "auto" and know your images will be brilliant.I have only taken this camera out twice
Both times I needed to have the camera ready in a hurry for a few shots and just switched it to "superior auto." The shots have been nothing short of amazing in some very difficult lighting

The camera's "superior auto" mode doesn't just jack up the ISO to take in enough light, like most dumb cameras I've owned

It does all sorts of crazy tricks (like merging multiple exposures) and delivers breathtaking results

Today I photographed a couple who were forced to stand in the shade so we could get a landmark framed just-right in the background

The landmark was in bright sunlight
Looking at the final photo, there is no hint of anything but perfect lighting in both the foreground and background


All I did was point the camera
It even recorded a full-res' copy of the photo cropped much better than I had framed it

It is completely nuts how smart this camera is


It gives you all of this brilliant help without doing anything

On the images where the camera provided its own crop, it recorded both my framing and its own version of the image

It must have upscaled the images it automatically cropped, because they are not missing any flippin' pixels


The quality looks just as good as the wider-framed version I composed

Wow.Shooting indoors sans-flash is just as great as you would expect when using a camera with a big sensor


It gathers tons of light, even in dim rooms
The slow kit lens will force the camera into ISO 3200 if shooting via lamplight and you will see noise in some indoor shots, but it is far superior to any point and shoot


True SLR quality in a compact-ish body


Shooting in "intelligent auto" mode delivers pro results
The camera doesn't intimidate subjects like SLRs tend to do

It's feather-light and easy to keep at your side
I'm completely in love with this camera!The largest compliant that I saw when reading professional reviews of this camera, were about difficulty accessing settings vs a real DSLR
It's true that every setting is accessed using camera menus, but I have found the layout and ease of access to controls very impressive
It is more intuitive than the menu system on my Canon cameras


The main reason that I bought the camera at a store was so I could mess around with the menus and settings to see if the all-digital controls would be a deal-breaker for me

The fact that I could easily access and control everything quickly without having even read the manual was the thing that pushed me over the edge to make the purchase


I find the control menus to be really good and I would not want to trade this camera's small body for a bunch of dials which only occasionally save me a half-second button press


Having used the camera, the "superior auto" mode is much better than lots of easily accessible dials when you need to take a quick shot anyhow.The included strap is too short to wear across your body if you're a bigger guy like me

It's fine if you wear it only around your neck but I hate carrying a camera like that
I find it easier to carry the camera at my side with the strap across my body

I had to buy a better strap
I highly recommend theBlackRapid RS10SC-1AO Metro Camera Strap (Black), even though it is overpriced


It is slim enough that it is a great match for the little sony NEX, and it has solid reliable-looking metal hardware.Another minor complaint is the lack of a viewfinder or accessory port, which the other Sony NEX cameras have


I would really like to have a viewfinder, and because this camera lacks the accessory port, adding one is not an option


I haven't had great difficulty framing my shots using the screen on the rear of the cam, but I'm just old fashioned and miss having a viewfinder.Update:Lowered review to four stars for a few reasons:I have run into a few situations where the display was too dim to frame shots properly in bright sunlight


There is a setting to put the display in "sunlight" mode which helps, but it is buried in the setup menu

The fact that this is not an automatic setting is absurd

Perhaps I'm spoiled by my phone and tablet, which do an admirable job of adjusting the display to light conditions, but the tech isn't groundbreaking and would be a huge asset to a camera where the display is the only option when framing shots
The lack of viewfinder, even as an add-on option, is the biggest shortcoming of this camera
After my last use, I have started to keep the camera in "sunlight" mode just to guarantee that I can use it easily outdoors when needed.Several of the pro reviews and a few amateur reviews complain that the battery charges in the camera rather than in an external charger
I like in-camera charging and it is better than trying to remember to carry an external charger like my Canon cameras

I have a few micro USB chargers around for charging other devices (like my headphones and my Kindle)


The problem is that the camera charges very very slowly

I was charging in my car on a three hour drive a few days ago and it was not able to fill the battery in this time


Also, it is very sensitive to charge faults
If you just plug it in and forget about it, you may find that the battery failed to charge at all


You should check the camera to insure the charge light is not flashing after it has been plugged in for a while (flashing indicates a charging problem)
If you have a charge problem, you must unplug it and try again
Most of the time you must remove and re-insert the battery

It often requires several tries to get it to begin charging
This is a major inconvenience.In the IAuto+ mode that I love so much, white balance is sometimes off

It can be severe when shooting indoors with incandescent light (very yellow cast)


It can be corrected if shooting raw, but it's a pain
Shooting in raw mode also reduces the effectiveness of the exposure tricks it plays in intelligent auto mode
It's too bad that Sony doesn't allow adjusting white balance in the auto modes


The best solution for accurate white balance shooting indoors, without flash and without using raw, is to use aperture priority mode, shoot wide open, and set the proper white balance yourself.I use a Mac

As of this writing (4/30/13), Apple's Aperture and iPhoto software do not support raw images from this camera

Sony provides a decent simple image editor called "Image Data Converter" for the Mac which works well
It is very straightforward and basic, but it gives lots of options for adjusting RAW images and doesn't have unnecessary BS trying to sell you prints and calendars
It's just a plain-Jane image tweaker for fine tuning and exporting RAW images as JPG
Apple is pretty regular about updating their software and I expect support soon, but the 3N is brand new and not supported in Aperture/iPhoto.Update 6/3/13: Apple updated OSX with raw support for the NEX 3N


Raw images work in Preview, iPhoto, and Aperture.Note about lens upgrade experiences:I purchased theSigma 30mm F2.8 EX DN- Sony E 330965lens to supplement the kit lens


It does give a slight advantage shooting indoors
At 30mm (45mm equiv), the kit lens is f5 and the Sigma is 2.8


This gives about 1-1/2 stops of light gathering ability
In real-life, it only gives about a half-stop (handleld) because the kit lens is stabilized, allowing you to shoot a slower shutter speeds
I wish I had spent a bit more and bought theSony SEL35F18 35mm f/1.8 Prime Fixed Lensinstead


It's two full stops faster and includes image stabilization


it is more than twice as expensive as the Sigma, but offers a much greater advantage in real world use compared to the kit lens on this camera.Conclusion after using it 5-6 times and a month of ownership:The cam is compact and takes great shots

The kit lens is slow but acceptable in good light
If you have any doubts about not having a viewfinder and money is no object, spend a bit more and get an NEX 6 or 7


All NEX cams are compact


This one is more compact but you aren't going to get this thing in your pocket anyhow

Considering how much I have complained about not having a viewfinder, I would still buy the 3N again simply because of the low price compared the the rest of the NEX line

$450-$500 is a lot of money to me
The NEX six and seven are double the price


Remember, there are SLR options with optical viewfinders for similar pricing, but they are too large for everyday carry in my opinion


You really should go to a camera store to compare several cameras side by side

Personally, if money were no issue my ideal setup would be the NEX 6 body and the Sony 35mm f1.8 lens for a total of about $1200
The 3N is HALF the price of the 6 with the exact same kit lens, and 1/3 of the price of my "ideal" camera example.This camera isn't perfect but it is hard to beat for the money.

$REVIEW.: I bought this processor back in august and it has been working great. It's easy to overclock and works great with any 1156 motherboard. Installation was easy and I have had no problems since then. One thing I didn't like about this processor was the price. I understand it's unlocked, but even at the time, there were comparable processors for cheaper. Other than that, it's a great processor. The extra 4 simulated cores work wonders along with the 4 physical ones. I bought this processor to build a new computer so that I could render videos faster, and the difference is very noticeable. If you're looking for a solid i7 processor this is a good buy.

Half the holes didn't line up, and one of the holes wasn't drilled out at all.  What should have taken 30 minutes ended up taking two hours.  I had to drill my own holes, and force others.

$review_text.: When it works, it works fine...unless you need a steady NIC connection.  I've over 15 years of PC hardware experience, so when I bought this board, I had no trouble building a PC with it.  However, the on-board NIC connection dropped every 6 hours or so.  Obviously, a flaw with the hardware.  I returned the board (and people who have built PCs know this is a labor intensive step, as the Motherboard is basically the foundation of your PC, and you have to take almost everything out of the PC or off the motherboard to remove it.  And, of course, when I received the replacement motherboard, I had to go through the process in reverse) for a replacement.  On receipt of the second Mobo, the NIC was a little more steady:  it might last as long as a day and a half before losing connection.  I've been in contact with ASUS customer service, who are attempting to suggest the problem is my network: no other machines on my home LAN have this issue, my previous PC at this location never had this issue...you can understand my skepticism.  If one does some research with other vendors such as NewEgg, it is easy to see the NIC is a known and persistent issue with this board.  Don't get it, save yourself the headache.

$REVIEW.: The main reason you may chosoe this sling backback over a regular backpack is its quick access feature. There is only one shoulder strap, which you wear it on your right sholder, and the sling bag is normally carried across your back in a slanted fashion.This is a very secure way of wearing the backpack, because the strap is worn across your upper body, not just on one shoulder. When you need to access your camera gear, there is no need to remove your backpack, as it is needed on a regular two-strap backpack; you just swing the sling bag from the back of body to the front. All of the zipper openings of the bag are easily within reach. You would also wear the sling bag in the front when you are concerned about your equipment being stolen while you move about on a busy and crowded street, for example. In this way, the sling bag is much more versatile than a regular backpack.Caselogic has made this sling bag convertable to a two-strap backback when you need to carry a heavier load and you don't need to constantly access your bag while on the move. The second strap is normally stashed inside a pocket that you can pulll out anytime to make the conversion.Concerned about weight, I don't carry a lot of gear when I use this sling bag, so this size is more than enough for me.

$REVIEW.: I'm using this with a Raspberry Pi which has 3.3V GPIO pins. I thought I'd be able to drive it with 3.3V by tying the Vcc to 3.3 and still running 5V to the relays' JD-Vcc. I couldn't get them to activate (or de-activate, rather) that way. However, when I use one of the two GPIOs with a built-in HW pull up (GPIO0 and 1 [SCA0 and SCL0]) and run 5V to Vcc and JD-Vcc, I can get the relays to operate. I plan to use a 3.3V to 5V level shifter to be safe.I should note that it appears one of the 4 relays is not operating correctly. I've not had a chance to debug. Thankfully, I only need 2 or 3 for the projects I have in mind.

In some cases, it's transferring files to another computer, some cases compiling pictures for a stand-a-lone picture display unit, and in some cases, for archival temporary storage.  I have also purchased an 8 Gb drive, but that's solely for taking my iPod music to my auto as I don't like leaving an iPod in the car, as the loss is far greater than losing a much less expensive music &#34;stick&#34;.

Instead, I settled for 1680x1050, which also looks good, but not as good. I don't recommend any other resolutions.  Also 4x3 or 5x4 aspect ratios do not work well.

I had to return the first one because it's operation was so erratic. By this I mean, it would not go on when I set the Input on my remote to activate it, instead the screen of my TV went purple and stayed that way until I unplugged it and restarted it. It got to the point where I  had to do that each time. It has happened one time with the one that was sent to replace it. I hooked it up to its own power source with a switch and keep it off until I'm ready to use it. That seemed to solve the problem; at least so far.

$REVIEW.: The phone is better than I imagined.  Volume and screen brightness are excellent over a wide range, with total voice clarity over local phone lines and over the internet to Siberia.  The unit sits solidly on the desk so I can press the keys firmly.  The timing is just right for my ability to enter alphabetic characters.  There is a lookup table accessible by the "@ #" button to enter further non-standard characters that might be in an email address.  Entering an email address does find the related Skype contact.  I can key in new contacts faster at the computer; the telephone unit updates automatically to match the computer contact list.  I can log in using a different Skype account.  Incoming calls ring at the devices that are logged into Skype.  If both are logged out, voicemail picks up at once.  If both are logged in, the phone unit rings once more than the computer (which I have set for a 15 second delay) before the voicemail announcement.  Both the phone unit and the computer save new voicemail messages.  After I delete messages from the phone, they are still archived at the computer.  I have lost nothing and have gained the use of my incoming and outgoing Skype lines at an additional location in the house, and at times when the computer is not turned on.  An online inquiry received a prompt phone call from technical support.  Count this a major triumph for Skype and for Xblue!

$review_text.: While these speakers do offer the nice options of a headphone jack, a line in jack, volume and tone controls, the audio quality is quite poor.  No adjustment to the tone control will yield a decent result. Output volume is substantial for a speaker this size.  But even much cheaper computer speakers I have owned have a flatter frequency response.  I see no reason to recommend these.  If you want good sound from your computer, spring for a $60 to $80 set that includes a subwoofer.  If you just want to be able to hear your computer, a $10 to $20 set will be smaller and work just as well.  These are in the no-man's-land of &#34;too cheap to be great&#34;, so they just aren't worth it.

$review_text.: I first started using Corel Draw back when I purchased a license of Corel Draw 2. The last full version that I bought and used was Corel Draw 8, not counting the home and student license of X5 I bought (but never really used) during one of Amazon's Gold Box Deal sales. I got away from using it at that point when I got assigned to teach a digital graphics & animation class where they were using Adobe's Photoshop 5 and Illustrator 10. I eventually bought myself a license of Adobe Creative Suite 4 Design Premium to use at home. And have since upgraded to their Creative Suite 5.5 - Design Premium. But now that Adobe has chosen to eliminate physical updates in favor for digital downloads (and maybe even going to an online application) I'm looking to go back to using Corel Draw. Nearly everything I need to do can be done with this new version of Photo-Paint and Corel Draw X7. You can even set the programs GUIs to mimic Photoshop's and Illustrator's.The one thing that I have not liked about this new package - is that the content libraries are all on-line now. I found them to be a bit clunky to navigate and somewhat confusing as to what the three different badges were suppose to represent. I couldn't find any reference to one of the badges in any of the online documentation. Not really a big deal for me, as I hardly ever use the stock clip-art, and I still have all the stuff that came with my previous versions of the software.The PDF manual that you can download is adequate for getting up to speed on the software - but I will be purchasing the CorelDRAW X7 The Official Guide (if and when it becomes available).I like the new versions of the software, with maybe the exception of the Website Creator package. First off, it doesn't come on the installation disc - you have to download it off the internet. And it doesn't install with the software packages. But I think the main reason I didn't have a positive feeling about it, is when you open it you are presented a matrix of squares much like the new Windows 8 GUI. That really turned me off. Again, not that big a deal as I don't really do a lot of web page creating these days - and when I do, I like to code things by hand using plain HTML. Maybe later I can play with the Website Creator software and see if I can get past the look of the opening screen.Over all I would say Corel's done an good job with this new release. I'd recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I'm not an audio expert so I can't tell you detailed info on why or why not this is better than others. All I know is for the last year I had a hard time with the lousy speakers on my new flat screen tv. It's WAY better now. I did have to get a converter because my tv only has digital audio output. The converter I bought doesn't work with the channels I get thru my antenna thus the speaker won't work with over the air tv channels, but we only really watch Netflix and DVD's anyway. Short story long, I'm very happy with this purchase.

$REVIEW.: I purchased one of these for all of my video's and just plain old stuff I thought a client might need later.  First I was really pleased to see how small this is.  The size was an added bonus.  I carry way too much around with me and I don't need the extra weight or have the space.  Second, I couldn't believe how fast that it transferred HD Video files.  The USB 3.0  speed is amazing.  I have been using firewire 800 and the USB 3.0 was much faster.  If you transfer large files you will definitely appreciate how fast this can do the work.  I bought 2 more.

$review_text.: I want to like these headphones


 I bought a pair of SportaPros and wanted a second pair, tried the PortaPros as they seemed to get slightly better reviews
 Now I am wondering - what are people listening to?  The SportaPros sound so much better than the PortaPros that I have to believe something is wrong

 No depth or layering or punchiness to the PortaPros


 Portas are mostly defined by over-response in the treble range


 I'm getting sound out of both earpieces so there is not a missing channel.I've heard all about the "burn-in" for headphones, but the Sporta's haven't needed that and I'm not sure how much time to waste on these Porta's
 I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD238 which beat the heck out of the PortaPros but are somewhat on a par with the SportaPros


 Now the Senns seem to be sounding better with more use as I did not like them as well out of the box, but do now
 Or my ears are getting "burnt-in" to their sound as I think happens also.Is there something wrong with my PortaPros?  I have no idea why there would be such dramatically poor quality in a product which most people seem to rate higher or on a par with the other phones I have.** Update 1/28/11 - another thing with these phones - the channels are reversed!  Listening to "All I've Gotta Do" by the Beatles (old stereo, music one side vocals the other) I have 3 sets of headphones where the vocals are right channel and the music is from the left channel


 On these, it is reversed (and yes I do know how to put them on, triple checked etc)
 WTH is the deal with these?** Another update - A1 Accessories is sending me a replacement pair today even though I've already lost all my original packaging and stuff

 So many thanks to them for so far great customer service


 I'll post on the new ones when they arrive.** Update 1/31/11
 Quick service from A1 Accessories to replace my headphones and now the sound is much better


 Now I can compare these to my other phones and the sound is definitely comparable (and channels are no longer switched)

 I am finding that the Firm - Light settings are very touchy


 They don't want to stay on the "Light" setting easily but that is a minor problem


 I am now much happier and have changed my stars review to reflect this.

$REVIEW.: The cable works perfectly


I ordered it last Thursday and it arrived Monday


That was on the slow boat ground


I was pretty pleased


The packaging was professional non-static

The device seems solidly built

I plugged it into my Visio via HDMI and connected it to the power source and my phone


My phone recognized the HDMI, but no image


I turned my tv off, and back on
Plugged my phone back in and voila, I saw the image of my phone on the screen
I surfed the internet, streamed videos from several sources, no problems

I will check it out on my Samsung 55, but I don't expect much

The adapter works perfectly


The only draw back is that the image is sent to the TV in the resolution of the phone
So an image sent via Netflixs Mobile app will be sent in a resolution meant for the phone, not a 55" Samsung


That said I did play a movie clip from the HTC video service, now that streamed in high def, just like the home videos I shot in 1080p that are on my Sensation
So like I said the device works as advertised

The limitations are in the quality of the video you are pushing
I read one review complain about the mini USB port being too lose or something like that; I had no problems like this whatsoever
I would recommend this product, c'mon its only 16 bucks.



$SUMMARY.: works as advertised, great price.

$REVIEW.: I think I live in the world's dustiest house, and for that reason, I had to get these dusting cloths. And I am thrilled that I did. Dust is no match for these! They work good on EVERYTHING! Small spaces, big spaces, corners, floors, shelves, ceiling fans, "stuff" that sits on my shelves, and anywhere else that collects dust. I love that they are soft enough to maneuver into tight spaces or dust delicate items, but also they are a bit rough so they wipe off that dust that clings more than it should. These also work good on my Swiffer which is a huge plus! I love that the sheets are perforated in small portions so I can just tear off a little piece if I only need that, or roll off a large portion if necessary. The box serves as a handy dispenser that allows you to feed the cloths through the top slot and grab what you need in a hurry. I am so happy that I got these. My house will finally pass the "white glove" inspection! :) I so very highly recommend these for those who want to banish dust & dirt for good! They really WORK!

$REVIEW.: This thing is fantastic where there's a lot of light. There's probably nothing better out there. Set it to 1080p with 60fps and you'll capture some of the best footage of your life on sunny days.That said, the battery life is absolutely terrible. This thing runs out of battery in less than an hour for me sometimes.Top that off with the fact that the front button is VERY easy to trigger in your pocket if you have it in the case. The button really needs to be stiffer! Often this thing will turn on in my pocket without me knowing and burn through the battery in standby. And holy cow watch your private bits if this happens because my goodness does it get hot.Bottom line: need an action cam for great outdoor or underwater footage? There's nothing better than this, so get it. Could it use some improvement? Sure, but the price is right and you can always carry a few extra batteries. I'm very happy with this purchase.

$review_text.: Plugged in for first time just minutes ago and wow, simply amazing! I'm a musician and am pretty demanding when it comes to sound quality, and relative to its small size and purpose, this thing puts out truly incredible sound
It's small, ridiculously easy to set up - just one, plug and play usb cord only (no power cord to fool with), no volume or power knob even since that's controlled by the computer's standard volume control, and quite nice in the asthetics department, too.I did see where one reviewer complained about the cord storage, no problems for me


Perhaps he got one that was too short, who knows, but mine wound up perfectly the first time, quite nifty as a matter of fact

It fit in the case quite perfectly as well.Rock on, Altec, you outdid yourselves on this one

And thanks to Amazon, too, I purchase gobs of stuff here simply because of the user reviews (not to mention Prime 2-day shipping, and amazing prices).

$review_text.: The problem, our 1998 car only has an audio tape sound system...and radio. No AUX plug ins, no CD and it is a 1998 and we do only drive it about 4000 miles a year given we live in Chicago. BUT we're doing a road trip and I need tunes, and though I can laugh at RUSH Limppaw for a few miles, gets old fast. So I looked at those gizmos that plug in and you add...but none had good reviews and it seemed so, dumb. To buy a gizmo for one job. So I rethought the problem. AND ta da. The reviews are right, these speakers are awesome. Will use on the deck, at the accupuncturist...wherever I need speakers that you can HEAR. And the audition was in the car this AM with only one of 'em. Got two (per stereo thoughts) and can't wait to hit the road. Brilliant product at a very fair price.PS Back from 6000 miles road trip and these speakers did exactly what we'd hoped for...my only comment would be, it would have been even better if the speaker had an adjustment for volume. But I ask a LOT of things. Still full marks for them. Went and bought another.
$SUMMARY.: YES YES YES!!!! Amazing sound for one so small.

$REVIEW.: I went looking for a cheap Tamron lens after a lady at a local camera store recommended I look into them. Found a used one here very cheap. First impressions, like the smooth feel of the zoom, love the larger focus ring (I manually focus 95% of the time). Got some decent shots, so it went into my bag as a mid-zoom option. This past Friday I went to a show, had room in my small bag so thru in the Tamron. The lighting was so bad I was having trouble focusing my 50mm prime, so I popped on the Tamron. I was able to get some decent shots in terrible lighting @80mm. Here's some examples. (...)

$review_text.: For 1/2 the price of what Canon charges, it's definitely a good buy
Just don't get a bad one.The most common problem is Opteka drops the voltage of a fully charged battery

So the battery indicator shows 1/2 empty even though the battery is not


If the same battery is inserted directly into the camera, it'll show fully charged.Mine happened to be one of the bad ones.The reason I rate 1 star is because Opteka's service
They do not respond to my email request even though I still have 8 more months of warranty.To be fair to Opteka, I also heard of similar problem with Canon's

But I am sure their after-sales is more responsive.

You can hardly know there is a case on it at all. I prefer the very thin cases because most phones are already big enough by them selfs, then when you add on the bulky cases like the otter box or some of the off brands you now are carrying a book and not a phone. This case seems very durable but very thin to fit in any pocket, shirt or pants. I've tested all angles of a possible fall and no position will allow the phone to be hit first. And if you are a holster person the Seidio surface holster for the phone fits and holds almost any case you buy not just their own Seidio cases.

$REVIEW.: I wanted a fast and big-capacity external drive that was also portable for my mid-2011 13" MacBook Air equipped with the Thunderbolt port


I make frequent business trips to Asia and always travel with two backup drives - the other being a Slim G-Drive 500GB


I had a slim Seagate 340GB drive but it's been acting real funky so I decided to get the Buffalo MiniStation 1TB drive for backup as well as keeping all of my music, movies, old photo and document archives that I didn't want taking up space on the 250GB MBA


During my travels, I keep one drive in the check-in luggage and one with the MBA in the hand-carry backpack, just in case I lose one or the other
I also have two large FireWire drives at home
One really can never have too many backups.I'm very pleased with the performance and the look of the Buffalo drive


After partitioning it to two separate drives (250GB for TimeMachine backup and the remainder for media archives), I got them encrypted and did a full-backup as well as moving over all the big media files much quicker than the USB or FireWire drives I have

I understand that the drive isn't all that fast but I'm just a business pro and do not use the drive to work on large media files like photos or videos to edit
I'm mainly a business productivity software, email, and web-surfing kind of guy so this drive more than exceeds my needs for backup and just accessing movies to view and having old archives for quick access.The Buffalo MiniStation is very quiet and it's one really handsome looking piece of gear that matches up nicely with all the other Apple gear I use: the MBA, 27" Thunderbolt Display, white iPad 2, and white iPhone 4S

It's so quiet that I don't even notice that it's doing a backup


It's also great to know that I have ample space left for future archiving of movies, music and photos that I don't need on the MBA
Accessing the files from the drive is as fast as I'd ever need it to be
I did notice that the copy/write speed is about 100MB/sec as another reviewer noted, which is plenty fast enough for my modest needs

This drive isn't cheap for 1TB storage space but that's plenty big and the fast performance, portability, and being able to use the MBA's Thunderbolt port are all big pluses for a business pro on the move

Highly recommended.

My only criteria was the size (42"), 1080p resolution, and a cost of no more than $600.00.  This set met all three, since Amazon had it on sale at a great price.  The picture quality is excellent, very sharp.  There are ample manual picture adjustments, but I just use the default "Standard" setting with a little more brightness added to suit the lighting in the room.My only two complaints really are not a complaints, but just facts of life with a TV in this price range:  it is on the thick side, and the bezel around the screen is a little wide, which is why I gave the TV four out of five stars for aesthetics.  However, this really is just being nit-picky, and it still looks great mounted on the wall.  One positive benefit of the thickness may be better speakers.  The speakers provide a much fuller sound without clipping or distorting than my other TV that cost three times the price.  I can only assume the thicker housing allows more room for bigger speakers that can better handle higher volumes.I don't game, so I can't comment on picture quality or motion response for this purpose.

$REVIEW.: This would be a great stylus for people who like to use a pen that has a mini-marshmallow stuck to the end of it
 The stylus uses a soft writing tip as large as the width of the barrel

 It provides a reall soft, mushy writing experience not at all like an actual pen.This stylus would be fine for pointer actiity and perhaps for drawing graphics live during a presentation
 It is not optimal for text notetaking, in my opinion.

$REVIEW.: I recently purchased an iPad2 and after searching for various types of cases and reading user views for the cases that caught my interest, I decided to buy the Bear Motion Genuine Leather Case

 I should note that I wanted a leather case and I was not interested in a case with a keyboard or other add-ons, just a good quality leather case that did not add much bulk to my iPad2
 I've had the Bear Motion Leather Case for a little over a week now, so I cannot comment on its long term wearability (it does seem extremely well made), but I can say that the case fits the iPad2 nice and snug, folds closed and puts the iPad2 to "sleep" as advertised, has all the cut-outs and holes in the right location (including perforations where the iPad2 speaker is located), can be folded to create a stand for watching the iPad2 and is made with what appears to me to be very good quality leather, stitched well, it's a real quality product

Given the prices I had seen for iPad2 cases in general, to get this leather case for the price I paid was a real bargain


I bought the case through Pro Ebiz and found their description of the Bear Motion case to be accurate and their delivery service to very fast


 Since I haven't had a problem I cannot attest to their customer service
One last thing, the packing was just great...in the normal box with bubble packs is a heavy plastic bag that just fits a blue velvet bag that finally contains the Bear Motion leather case

 No way this thing was getting beat-up in transit
Fantastic case, great price, fast shipping, done deal!

$review_text.: I have a Blackberry Storm and was disappointed that it did not have an external antenna port.We take our RV to remote places and like the ability of being able to access both the Internet and make Cell calls.We also live in a Rural area in Minnesota and I am often driving our car in weak cell strength areas.I am a Verizon customer primarily because of their extensive coverage.Being a past customer of Wilson Electronics for Cell antennas for my cars and RV's over the years, I called and talked with their Tech Support staff looking for advice on being able to increase signal strength to my Storm.They were excellent and very helpful.They suggested this package to help solve my issues.I connect the Wilson Amp to their Trucker antenna when in the RV.And I use the 12" antenna in this package in our car.I have found it is fairly quick to move the amp between the RV and car.I have been in several places where there was no signal without the amp but have been able to get 2-3 bars with it.Of course there are places where no matter where what you do, there is just no signal available to amplify.But I am confident if one is available, I can use it.This unit comes with a "Hersey bar" antenna that goes inside the car.I have found that the best way to use it with the Storm is to Velcro it to the antenna.I also Velcro the antenna to my dash and just pull the antenna cell phone combination off to use and make calls.I have also found that I can use this combination to tether my cell to my computer and use it as a data modem.Perhaps the only thing that would be better for my situation is to have a smaller Hershey bar antenna that would just fit the back of the Storm or iPhone.(Although I understand they have developed a unit just for the iPhone)I have been consistently pleased with Wilson Electronics products.They have been durable and long lasting.I have recommended them to friends without hesitation as well.

$review_text.: I bought this about a month ago for my mother, for her 70th birthday.  She has a treadmill that she walks on daily, and found those sessions quite boring, so my sister suggested an MP3 player.  Mom is definitely not the type to get any use out of something as big and expensive as an iPod, and there's no way she'd *ever* understand the iTunes software anyway...  We wanted something less expensive yet still decent quality and easy to use.  This SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip fit the bill precisely.I ripped Mom's favorite CD's to her computer, downloaded the songs onto the Clip, and spent less than 10 minutes showing her how to use it.  And believe me she's NOT a technically-inclined person.  She uses it every single day, and has had absolutely no problems whatsoever finding the song(s) she wants to listen to, or putting in in Shuffle-mode if she just wants to listen to random songs while doing her daily walk, or listening to the radio if one of her programs is on.  Zero problems with it, and she's had me rip even more of her CD's to it so she can have a larger selection of music to listen to.Is it the highest-quality music-reprodution out there?  No.  But it's more than good enough for anyone to use during a workout, which probably isn't the best acoustical environment anyway, so there really shouldn't be much complaining about the sound-quality, I would think.Its memory-expansion slot means that you can add 16GB or 32GB to it if you ever run out of room -- and that's a LOT of music right there.  I definitely consider that to be a big plus!  Such a tiny player, and potentially so much storage space -- really wonderful that they put the expansion slot in there.So, in summary, I believe that this device is absolutely perfect for its intended use, and it's a bonus that it's easy enough to use so that a 70-year-old technophobe can actually enjoy it immensely.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for a simple, inexpensive, easy-to-use, yet expandable MP3 player.  Good job, SanDisk!!

$review_text.: Even if they don't last long (they charged great and have worked fantastic thus-far), I couldn't care less.  Two batteries for less than $10 is a bargain compared to over $30 a pop in downtown SF.Update: 12/27/12:So I have used both batteries on a full-draw-down.  So far, they seem to last as long as my Canon battery that came with my T3i.  It is possible (I haven't run precise testing on this) that they are about 90% as long from a battery-life perspective.  However, I have been doing more long-exposure work lately, so I have a feeling this has altered my perception of the battery life.As I stated above on my original review, even if they didn't produce the same battery life, these things are a life saver.  With two extra batteries in my bag (for now),  I can shoot all day with no worries.  Note, I am not a professional, but when I am shooting -- I shoot a lot!Finally, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND charging the batteries to a full charge when they arrive.  Once in the camera, I run them all the way down to 0.  Then, I charge to 100% when I get home.  I rotate these batteries with my original Canon battery to keep my set in relatively uniform age / usage.  I have read elsewhere that this strategy preserves battery life -- even if others contend that these types of batteries do not benefit from such treatment.

$REVIEW.: I have had a couple of these privacy shields for different devices and I think that the 3M are the best of the bunch.  I have one on my MacBook that just shuts out anyone who is not on my lap or literally looking over my shoulder.  That's the way I like it.I was expecting a good experience when I put this on my teenager's iPad and it went on perfectly easily.  The other interesting outcome is that it looks less shattered in the corner where he sat on it.  It must somehow be a tinting?Anyway, it ended up coming off that iPad pretty quickly because it was too effective.  The children tend to cluster together to play a game or watch one being played.  The two children on the sides kept getting more and more on the oldest's lap until he couldn't play it anymore.  I don't know what he yelled because it was in Spanish, or I would repeat it for you.  The filter came off really easily, so then I put it on my husband's iPad and he hasn't complained.  I'm pretty sure he noticed it as I was getting dirty looks at the table and it wasn't because of my cooking.

$review_text.: Ths Bluetooth adapter works well with 64 bit Windows.  If you read reviews of other brand Bluetooth adapters, you'll discover that many generic Bluetooth adapters have problems with the Bluetooth stack and drivers not working with newer releases of Windows.  For this particlar adapter, the 64 bit Windows software is available on the manufacturer's web site.  To set up this adapter, download the software rather than using the CD in the package.  It takes a surprisingly long time to install the software - almost 20 minutes.  Once the driver software was installed, I was able to pair my Android phone and wireless speakers with my computer with ease.The Kinivo adapter uses a Broadcom chip set.  I ran into problems with the Broadcom web site with other generic Bluetooth based adapters: the Broadcom web site download package generating an error message while trying to instrall the drivers.  Kinivo has the Necessary drivers on its own web site, thus avoiding the problems with Broadcom's web site.If you've spent hours with an inferior Bluetooth adapter trying unsuccessfully to get your wireless speakers to pair with your computer, you'll really appreciate this procduct because this adapter works.

$REVIEW.: *** UPDATE (April 2013): Less than 5 months in, 1 of the 2 fans is pretty much shot (rattling very loudly), and there's no way to replace it (or unplug it). This has been a waste of money. I do not recommend it!! ***---This is my second Zalman cooler (the first being an NC2000-NT). My previous cooler lasted about 16-18 months before one of the fans started rattling, making it unsuitable for regular use without noise-blocking headphones. I opted to try this one as it was considerably cheaper and, like the other, purported to be "ultra quiet."First and foremost, this product *does* help cool laptop. I'm running a mid-2009 15" MBP with both the internal LCD and an external display. This is my primary work platform, and I put it under fairly heavy use during the day. Streaming video tends to spike the heat generation, and subsequently the internal fans, on the device. The Zalman cooler helps more effectively dissipate the heat, resulting in the internal fan speed being greatly decreased.Second, this unit is *not* "ultra quiet." If anything, I would say it's even a little louder than the NC2000 was (suggesting that the fans may not be of the same quality). The noise is especially prevalent when the fans are dialed up to full speed. Perhaps this is indicative of the fan technologies in general, but don't expect this to be whisper quiet by any means; at least, not on full speed.Third, it's a bit a small. My 15" MBP overhangs the cooler by about 3/4" on both sides. The description claims that this is for laptops up to 17", but I would definitely not use it on anything larger than 15".Fourth, it is very lightweight; much lighter than the NC2000. If you're looking for something to hold on your lap, then this could be ideal (again, assuming you can tolerate the noise). The majority of this NC1500 is constructed of plastic, with only the cooling plate directly under the laptop made of aluminum. I can't vouch for its durability, but I'd suggest being careful not to drop it.Fifth, the location of the USB ports, fan speed dial, and power button are terribly placed on the back side of the device, behind the built-in LCD display. The NC2000 has the same controls/ports located on the right-hand side, which is far more convenient. My laptop is placed in front of a raised stand that hold me external display. In order to change the fan speed, I must now tip my built-in LCD display down in order to reach around/over it to turn the dial. This is really a terrible engineering decision on Zalman's part.BOTTOM LINE:Given all of these concerns, I do *not* recommend the cooler. I will use it until it dies its inevitable death, but its successor will definitely be different (likely something with larger fans and better control placement).

 I never manually turn the button off

 I actually lost my kindle with this cover on a flight from LA to Sacramento (the 4th and final leg of the return trip from India), so was forced to get a new Kindle ..


this time I got the Kindle Keyboard, and since I was so happy with the old case, I got the Kindle Keyboard version of this iPearl case and love it just as much as my original blue one!  You can't go wrong with the case and the price!!

$REVIEW.: I am just taking my first step into Blu-ray and Netflix streaming video.  I ordered this Sony player based on the strength of reviews. I couldn't be happier.  First of all, most of our movies and shows are on DVD.  This model does a beautiful job of rendering older DVD's onto our HDTV. Many of our older DVD's have scratches and smudges and often would not play at all on any of our DVD units. This Sony plays those same DVD's without a hitch.Blu-rays look fantastic, to be sure. But we don't watch many of them.  However the Netflix streaming video has been a pleasure.  It is a different experience, to be sure...but the ability to grab Netflix movies and TV shows cheaply has caused us to cancel our Dish Network and use our Sony to deliver much of the content we want, since most of the shows we were interested in are available (as seasons) on Netflix.  It is nice that this player is now paying for itself.Great Blu-ray!

$review_text.: Received it today


Easy to setup

Very fast LAN Gbs and WAN

With Comcast WAN connection delivered over 27Mbs on Speakeasy

My old Linksys BEFSX41 could only pump 14Mbs max

Upload speed is the same ~730Kbs


 Also, some folks are tempted to verify Gbs speed with casual file copying from one PC to another


Not so easy: with modern hard drive you can only scratch Gbs bandwidth (~25% utilization max) simply because HD could only deliver about 30-35 MB/s  sustained read/write rate (~300Mbs)

Gbs LAN could push 125MB/s on both send and receive channels (full duplex)


In order to saturate the link you will need to spend a big chunk of green for raid 0, or 10 array with 4+ disks on both PCs


Took some time to set time restriction policy for kids PCs


As usual, it takes two blocking policies: one for early morning and one for late evening hours


Unit interface is impressive and you can feel the quality of router software and linux OS heart is beating in this speed devil
Unit came with firmware v1.7, upgraded it to v1.8 right away as it was available


Just a note: do not forget to enable automatic time configuration, otherwise router will show some funny date/time stamps in the logs

Very surprised with features and unit build quality
Xbox360 works flawlessly on Xbox-Live


Would recommend this router ...any time...

$REVIEW.: I needed a memory card that could record a whole day event.At first my camcorder didn't recognize the card until I formatted it.  After I formatted it, I turned the camera on (which is currently set at Canon FXP level of compression) and low and behold, 8 hours and 40 minutes capacity.I tested out the card by recording some video and then viewing it using the supplied reader.  The footage came up a-okay.The reader is sort of okay, however I found out my existing card reader could read SDXC so I was fine without it, although it's always handy to have a nice little portable reader.So I'd highly recommend this card.  It seems to work well with my camcorder and the price was the lowest I could find for that capacity.  Add in the reader and it's a bargain.

$review_text.: I got the HD for creating videos for the Web using Flash Media Server 3.5 as the streaming video server
I also have a Canon HD


Of the two cameras, the Flip is far easier to use with the Web and the quality of the Flip is comparable
First, the MP4 files easily convert to F4V files for H.264 quality, and that saves time

Second, I can edit the MP4 files with Adobe Premiere, iMovie or Final Cut and I don't have to fool around with HD tapes (which require a drive that I don't have and have to use the camera for a VCR)

Third, the 720 format turns out great on the Web with a streaming server.Last summer I took it with me on vacation to Prague, Czech Republic

It was so small I could put it in my shirt pocket without any problem, pull it out and make videos, and pop it back in without a lot of hassles


At the hotel, I plugged it into the hotel's computer USB port for re-charging, and it performed flawlessly.As far as I'm concerned this is THE hd camcorder for the Web and for travel.

$review_text.: We ordered two headsets, both with sound quality more than sufficient for a child. The one from Amazon arrived immediately, but the one from Family Safe arrived 3 weeks too late -- charging us extra for a return and refund, never order from them again.But the headset itself was well made so stick to Amazon Fulfillment. Safety feature for volume control was a plus and worked well. We bought the headset for a 4 year old, but it would fit any head size from a 3 year old to a teenager. The major benefit is that it silences You Tube and video apps for the rest of the room, adding a modicum of peace to a child's browsing. The only hassle is the length of the cord, close attention needs to be paid that the child, pets, and parents don't trip or choke on the excess length (for an Ipad).

The selection of ear-sized-appliances is great - they allowed me to match my ears accurately.BUT - The ear-buds do not have any indication of which goes in the left-ear and which goes in the right-ear!  Much of the material I listen to is spatially sensitive and it gets pretty annoying to have to 'try them out' and swap ears half of the time.The problem was solved by determining which one was the left and tying a knot in the lead just below the earbud.

$REVIEW.: Most PS3 owners enjoy not only the gaming abilities of their system, but also the built in Blu-Ray DVD player. The Sony remote control accessory lets you play those movies with great ease.The remote combines the regular buttons of our other DVD players with the funky look of the PS3. You have a red, green, blue and yellow button - labelled with their color names! You also get a circle, X, square and triangle to do a few things like brinigng up the options and back choices.The main buttons - play, stop, forward, back - are laid out reasonably nicely at the bottom of the remote with large buttons. There are small buttons up on top for the number keys, and a very tiny eject button.Missing completely is a power button!! You have to hit the PS button in the center and go through the regular PS3 menus to get the power to turn off. In fact, while I was writing this review, I accidentally hit a button on the remote and the PS3 turned on. We were watching regular TV, so now I have to wait until our show is over, switch over to the PS3 and use the buttons to turn the system back off again. That doesn't make much sense at all to me.Also, on our Oppo DVD remote, the buttons glow which makes it REALLY nice to use in the dark or dim light that most people watch movies in. This unit is completely black with black buttons. This makes it pretty much useless in low light conditions until you memorize all of the button locations. You would think by now that remote control makers would have their buttons backlit or at least glow-in-the-dark to handle this.The unit takes two AA batteries which makes it a bit heavy, but certainly within the normal range of remotes.It's easy enough to sync up the remote with the PS3. It's bluetooth powered, so you go into the PS3 menu and use the options there to indicate you have a new remote. Note that the base level PS3 will not handle this - you have to have a connection to the internet from your PS3 and run an update routine. If you don't have an internet connection for your PS3, you have to create an update CD on your PC to do this update.Well recommended - but it really could be much better to be great.

I doubt I'll ever fill the card, especially since I try to download once a week or shortly after pictures are taken, but still...1100 pictures! It's almost ridiculous. The extra capacity means more movies and feeling confident that I won't miss capturing anything on vacations or other situations where a lot of photos will be taken.The card itself seems very fast in capturing and exporting and it has been reliable thus far.

Don't get all caught up in the multitude of tilt settings, it tends to want to rest in the last slot of each slot grouping. And honestly, that's fine. These micro-tilt options will make little difference in your viewing experience. Think about what you really need: flat (no tilt), slight tilt -- for typing, and almost vertical -- for watching videos.

Honestly , i think this OPteka SteadyVid PRO product looks pretty good and feel rock solid , but the engineering is poor ....when Optekas engineering this product so call PRO , they forgot to test  with manies kind of other " Light weight" camera and camcorder ( i dont know but guess ) that is why they only make three choices of  counter weights  .To me ,  counter weight correcting  is extremely important to achieve a perfect balance (to me ...the drop  time when test holding horizontal  should be  2 second to consider ok , if it drop faster than that then it will be swayed when in motion) ....too light = wont hold it up ....too heavy = sway when in motion ...with product so call "Steady , Stabilizer" even a little  less or more weight is unacceptable....I will make another test with the same camcorder and with  another Camera Stabilizer this weekend then i will review this again.

I have tried the auto setting and the manual settings. No benefit to either. A working clock is the essence of timer recording. I will return it in hopes of getting one with a working clock. If it fails to keep a semblance of accurate time, I will buy a Panasonic.  I like this recorder. It has a beautiful picture on playback and is easy to set up, but timer recordings are impossible.  BL

$REVIEW.: I bought these earbuds, mostly on price, for use while training for a marathon and other outdoor use. They held up very well for about 4 months, surviving dozens of runs (they seem impervious to heat and sweat), use in the rain, and even a trip through a full machine washer and dryer cycle (accidental). Comfort and sound quality were great, and the buds held firm in my ears no matter how much moving around I did. Unfortunately, this particular design's Achilles' tendon is the connector between the cord and the mini-plug. Eventually the connection worked its way loose. For a while only one earbud worked, and then, suddenly, even that was silenced, never to work again. Very likely this was my fault, as I was pretty rough on them, but it's something to consider when shopping around.Overall, I'd certainly recommend these as great value for money, and very nice all-around earbuds.
$review_summary.: Worth the price, but won't last forever.

$REVIEW.: I didn't think I would ever replace the sony that I had
This was like buying the exact same TV except it is an LED with 3D


 The 3D works great when coupled with my OPPO Bluray player


 The TV is quiet and there is really no warm up time
 I can't speak for the sound as I have everything run through a Denon receiver with Bose surround


 It is an excellent TV for the size


 I think it will take a huge leap  in the evolution of television before I replace this.

$SUMMARY.: Great!

$REVIEW.: This is not a plug and play device unlike the hard drive enclosures and requires you to connect a power supply, then a sata cable and third a USB cable. Not what I expected and not very simple for a layman. Looks cheaply made too, especially the power adapter. However, it does the job and connects any hard drive, peripheral device etc. If you're only looking at connecting an 2.5 internal hard drive from an old laptop then I highly recommend the Sabrent enclosure for $5-6.

$REVIEW.: Well, after long wait and search since last year and price up and down, finally pulled trigger on this S-550.  The best decision to complete my home theater system.  I am shocked at Panny BD35 and BD55 price hike/ fluctuation and scarcity, but the Sony S-550 will get  what you need.  At $284 bought this month with Amazon, while the Panasonics are selling at sky-limit price, I am a very satisfied and happy camper here.The Sony s-550 is very very easy to set up, in fact 10 min, provided you have your wireless router with ethernet cable ready for internet connection, your HDMI cable ready from your 7.1 HDMI receiver (Onkyo 606).  The unit will start once powered up to let you walk through set-up with extremely easy like baby step. The player runs quiet and smooth with stunning quality, in all, it plays very well as what you expected from Sony players.The picture/video and audio from this baby is amazing, blu-ray is truly entertaining and addictive !  Very happy and highly recommend this S-550.I know as long as Panny are in short supply  till the new BD 60 and 80 come out, this  sony S-550 will be in high demand and of coures, price hike will follow as soon as it is getting scarce!  Get this before it is out of control again.  BTW, software update is a breeze, make sure you have your internet connection ready.
$SUMMARY.: Sony S 550 is superb

$review_text.: After trying to upgrade our internet package to a higher speed with Time Warner, I soon found out that the combined modem/router they gave us (at a rental fee no less!) was worse than our older not-DOCSIS-3.0 modem! Throughput on our Roku went down to single digit Mbps, compared to double digits on the old modem (with a D-Link DIR-655 router). The iPads were better, but our phones weren't as fast either. Tried all the usual tricks and matched the new settings to our old without luck.After some research, I quickly found out that buying my own modem would pay for itself in under a year in rental costs! Plugged it in, plugged our router, and immediately throughput speeds were back at double digit Mbps on the Roku. iPads and phones were maxed at our package speeds!For anyone who's paying a rental fee on their cable modem from their provider, it's really easy math. It may take a bit longer if you also need to get a router though. Regardless, keep your provider for more than a year or two, and it pays off. I can't recommend this product enough!

$review_text.: I thought I had already submitted a review for this case and at first I would have given it 4 stars based on the case perhaps being a bit too snug. Well, I've had the case for 3 or 4 months now and I'd have to say the case fits my 17&#34; HP laptop very well. It is snug but taking the laptop in and out of the case is no problem. The carrying strap and handles seem secure and the padding is probably enough to protect the laptop if you might happen to bang into something like a door frame (just a guess). I suspect you'd be less fortunate if you dropped it onto a hard floor. However, I'd say it beats most neoprene sleeves that are around the same price point and it is much more versatile. The main pouch is covered by a velcro secured flap and it's big enough to hold the power cord and a few other items. There's also a sleeve on the back that could hold a few pads of legal sized paper. For the money I give this case a solid thumbs up.

$REVIEW.: I installed this on a ULV dual-core ultra portable laptop and the sound of HD whir and clicking is replaced with a buzzing CPU fan (which I had not heard before)!  As it turns out, by removing the bottleneck (5400 rpm SATA II drive), the CPU is the new bottle neck!Scored 7.8 on Win 7x64, which clean boots in about 20 sec.  An SSD was probably an overkill in terms of performance for an ultra portable system, but I like the extra power saving (normally got 7-8 hours on the fully charged battery, and now I get 1-2 extra hours on read-intensive usage).On the negative: It's been over a month and still no confirmation of my $40 rebate...

$REVIEW.: This is a versatile, strong case. I am not a person to usually put cases on my devices, but with a 2 year old asking for the tablet I decided I needed something strong in case he decides to trow it. So far this case has delivered and surpassed my desires.The case is extra strong being built of both a hard plastic case that hugs your iPad but has an additional rubber case around the first. This gives it a protection from falls while adding a nice surface for fingers to gripe and hold onto. The case has just the right difficulty to take off, easy enough for an adult near impossible for a kid.You may think all this rubber and plastic will just get in the way, but you would be mistaken all buttons are extended to the edge of the case so everything is as easily accessible as before.And the case has a built in screen protector that does not cause missed or inaccurate taps on the screen.The leather strap on the back of the case is great, it allows for a more comfortable use with only one hand, big or small as it is adjustable. With the strap the iPad will not slip out of your hands even if you place it upside down. Behind the strap is a metal latch, when you place your finger in the opening and pull it reveals a great kick stand for the iPad built right in. It works for both portrait and landscape, and has rubber feet so as not to scratch the surface it is standing on. In portrait it was comfortable to read it at that angle while my hands were busy with the baby.This is the best bang for the buck case if you are going for rugged. Some competitors provide similar protection but have less features, like missing the kickstand for example or making you buy it separate. Yet this case has a very high quality finish and materials.

$review_text.: Junk. I bought this from "RainbowImaging"I wish I had checked to see if it worked when I first received it, but instead I just assumed it would and saved it for my (rare) flash photography. Now I cannot get it to work, even by following the directions exactly. (connecting it with the camera and flash turned off) the flash works on my camera, but when connected with this cable, the camera does not recognize it. Buyer beware, this was a total waste of money for me. I checked the packing and couldn't find anything about a manufacturers warranty. I wish I had just bought the Canon cord.

$review_text.: The sensor connects/links easily and quickly with the Garmin Forerunners. Installing the unit took quite a bit of trial and error. First you gotta make sure the tiny magnet can be correctly setup on your crank. Once it's stuck on, then you also have to zip-tie it on. Some cranks don't have a smooth inner area, some are hollowed out and not flat, so the sticking and zipping can be tricky. So once you get the crank-arm issue set up... on to the chain stay. That's the part on the bike you mount the sensor. It's a balancing act between getting enough room/distance for both the crank sensor and wheel sensor to align. too far back and the speed may hit your spokes... too far forward and the speed will not register, but the cadence will. ETC. One bike I did was easy took 5 minutes. Another bike was trickier and took a bit longer. But when it's installed it woks like a charm.knowing my cadence has been the biggest help to improving my cycling skills.

$REVIEW.: If I had the option of rating the computer separate from the OS, I would give it 5 stars. Since I can't, it gets 4. Windows 8 has too much of a learning curve from previous versions and an operating system designed for touch screens should never have been allowed in non-touch devices. The interface for non-touch computers is truly poor and makes using the computer cumbersome. It is very non-intuitive. HOWEVER, the computer is great! Blazing speed, all the bells and whistles; Blu-Ray, media card reader (I found it by accident), AWESOME screen resolution, and reasonable sound quality make this the best Windows laptop I've ever owned. I have a MacBook Pro as well so almost any Windows machine is inferior as far as ease of use and intuitive programming. The BEATS audio is mediocre, at best; my old HP ZV6130 laptop has Altec-Lansing, forward-firing speakers that sound a lot better even without the much-touted Beats-subwoofer.If you buy this computer, and I DO recommend it if you don't mind the cumbersome learning curve of Windows 8, definitely get the Start8 software adjunct to give you back control of your start menu, desktop, and file manipulation. Who knows; maybe Windows 8.1 will be an improvement but I doubt it.

$REVIEW.: UPDATE: 4/29/13 (original review below)I had to drop this from 5 to 4 stars.  The reason is that while I am very happy with speed and wireless range, a key element is that it allow me to have excellent VOIP service.  My original review focused upon the QoS aspect, and that has worked well.  However, I've had a few dropped calls on our VOIP. The internet connection is strong / reliable.  Our WOIP provider took a look at the packets / and our router and said that the reason is that this router has "SIP ALG" enabled, which can cause sporadic VOIP problems.  If ASUS can release a firmware update that allows me to disable SIP ALG, I'll take this back to five stars, but for now, it's 4.  If the drops become more disruptive, I'll lower it.ORIGINAL REVIEWI had been very happy with some Apple Airport Extremes to provide our wired and wireless connections in the home, until we started using VOIP phone service.  These are business phone lines and need to be perfect.  The VOIP provider is Nextiva.A little internet research will confirm that VOIP phone service really needs QoS, which, in layman terms, reserves enough bandwidth for your VOIP phones to have the best call quality.  In other words, if someone starts downloading a large file or receives an email with a large attachment on your network, your phone will keep "priority" so that it has all the bandwidth it needs.The Apple products don't have QoS. While I had been very happy with them for many years, I switched to ASUS, thinking it would be a lot harder.  It really wasn't.  Some of the nomenclature is different, but with little effort, the ASUS was able to assign specific IP addresses to certain machines on our Local Network and with a little help from Tech Support at Nextiva, I was able to setup the QoS.  Since then, our VOIP phones have had excellent quality.  A great improvement.We actually have a few of these, which replaced a few Apple devices.  It's also easy to setup so that one ASUS unit handles assigning the IP's and the others merely extend the signal so that your devices (phones, laptops, etc.) will automatically switch from one unit to the next as you walk around -- keeping the strongest signal.

There are two more expandable pockets on the outside too.The material is sturdy ballistic nylon.I bought it for my Acer 1410 11.6
 I fits great and allows me to carry the charger, a notebook mouse, cables, slim dvd drive and a large micro fiber cloth which helps pad the computer

$REVIEW.: Needed 100 ft and there was exactly enough on the spool
 Bought this a few months ago and just went to order some more and noticed all the bad reviews saying the wire is not copper and/or its not 12 gauge and/or its not 100 feet long

 Well I know there was 100 feet on the spool I installed or it wouldn't have done the job

 Decided to get the wire gauge and measure this wire

 According to the wire gauge I have this IS 12 gauge

 Do NOT go by the holes in a wire stripper, they are often LARGER than the gauge they are stripping to prevent cutting the wire

 Use a real wire gauge to measure wire diameter.This wire is used on a 5.1 home theater system pushing a total of 525 watts
 I can tell no detectable volume or sound degradation

 For the length of wire I ran 12 gauge is the minimum size recommended


 All is well.So I got what I paid for, but will order something else this time because there are too many reviews saying they were shorted or have plated aluminum, or there was some sticky stuff on the wire, etc.I don't like playing Russian Roulette.

$review_text.: What a bargain.  I was searching for an HDMI to mini HDMI cable for myFlip MinoHD Camcorder, 60 Minutes (Black)and came across this item.  Since it is offered below cost I decided to take a gamble and buy it.  Am I ever happy I did.  It is constructed of quality materials and does it's job. I can easily now watch my videos from my Flip camcorder on my LCD widescreen TV.  Don't waste your money on those over-priced brands. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: As a long time Canon user, I was ready for the next level of performance for both stills and video. So far the 70D has met or exceeded my expectations. The articulated touch screen makes live view, video and menu settings very convenient. While I often use the P mode to shoot with specific ISO settings and aperture or shutter priority for their specific functions, I have found the full Auto performance to be very impressive and usually leave it as my default setting.The HDR (High Dynamic Range) scene function has proven useful and is much more convenient than the old method of taking individual images and doing post processing in the computer.Because the flash often will pop up when taking pictures in Auto that have any back lighting, I appreciate the &#34;no flash&#34; dial setting as a convenient way to keep the flash disabled.I have not shot extensive video yet, but the test clips I have done are all well focused and great resolution.I look forward to enjoying the 70D for some time to come.

$review_text.: The good- sound quality is excellent for the money. (I bought these over two years ago I think I paid $90 now they're only $47.00- these we're an editors choice on Cnet when I bought them January 2010.- Klipsch has newer versions of these headphones but they really haven't changed much.- build quality is good the cable does seem a little small at first but if you use these for running or workouts the small cable is nice.- comfort is excellent I can wear these for long periods of time.- they come with a very nice tin carrying case that also holds extra tips and a cleaning tool.- These are my go to headphones for workouts and travel. I use them almost every day for two years and they have proven to be pretty tough.- noise isolation is excellent they act like ear plugs to block out outside noise.My criticisms- don't wear them  after you get out of the shower! My first pair got water damage from just that and one side quit working. (Luckily they were under a two year warranty so I sent them back and quickly got a new pair.)- be careful not to lose the little ear tips. You can get spares if you do though.Bottom lineThese are great in ear headphones. They have been my go to set for over two years now and if you've never had a quality set of headphones the sound quality will blow you away. At under $50 these are a steal I might even pick up another pair to have as a backup in case anything were to happen to my current pair.
$SUMMARY.: If I had to choose one pair of headphones these would be it.

$review_text.: I purchased this as an upgrade to a new Lenovo x230
 The 7MM height is mandatory for this computer.The boot time is less than 10 seconds (seems like 5!) with only Windows Office 2010 Pro loaded on top of Windows 8 Pro


 This is a substantial improvement over the SATA 7200 RPM 500GB drive that came with the unit

 I simultaneously purchased and installed 16 GB of RAM, an upgrade to the 4GB that came with the unit
 No idea which of these individually contributed the most to the boot time improvement.The software provided with the Samsung unit did not work - at least for me
 I believe that may have been due to one or both of the following issues:1)  Lenovo installs recovery software, and I believe these are in WinPE (Pre-Installation Environement) volumes, of which there are two.2)  A generic cable did not come with this package


 The Apricorn SATA to USB 3.0  cable set I purchased for the installation, set a driver so the software did not recognize the Samsung drive.[Samsung Electronics 840 Pro Series 2.5-Inch 256 GB SATA 6GB/s Solid State Drive MZ-7PD256BW ]It was easy enough (after thinking through the problem) to download the recovery program to a USB flash drive, and reinstall the operating system

 In fact, that opens up about 9GB of additional space, as the WinPE moves to the flash drive
 Be certain the flash drive is large enough for the recovery programs

 Anything beyond that requirement will be lost GB , as you don't want to write over these recovery programs (i.e., the flash drive is permanently dedicated to the recovery of the drive)


 Another solution to the Apricorn cable would have been the use of an external SATA drive enclosure (about $15-20), and that can be used to house the original drive after the installation.This drive is QUIET, and has increased the battery run time to over 10.5 hours

 This unit also generates very little heat

 All-in-all, pricier than many other SSD drive options; but, the performance from any higher-end SSD option is very noticeable

 This drive is one of the highest rated - if not the standard used by several reviewers.The Amazon price was the best in the market on the day that I bought the drive and the memory.

$review_text.: I purchased this TV November 2007 from Amazon.  I was happy for 2 years because the picture was just awesome.  About 8 months ago I had a slow start problem.  It took up to 15 minutes for the TV to turn on.  Samsung repaired that for free.  Just recently however, when I turn the set on the entire left side of the screen jumps all over the place and this condition will last for anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes before clearing up.  I called out an authorized repair dealer (Sears) and the guy said it would cost $800 or more to replace the main panel.  I immediately contacted Samsung and they have not bothered to return my call or email.  While I love the picture, I hate the company.  Goodbye Samsung!

$REVIEW.: As a serious semi pro who mainly uses a DSLR, I've taken over 4000 excellent shots with the Nikon L610. The new L620 does have a more sensitive CMOS for low light photos- but Nikon, has short changed us with several serious drawbacks with the L620-perhaps to keep the price the same.  While the CMOS is more sensitive, it has two serious drawbacks. First is a much slower shutter speed, without flash in any of the "Auto" scene modes.  Unless the subject is really still, you're going to get blur and far less color saturation- and a much more washed out shot. The second problem is the flash on the L620. It takes 15 to 20 seconds for the flash capacitor to recharge the flash between shots- compared to only a second or two with the L610- even worse, the flash doesn't even start to charge until you hold down the shutter half way! Think 30 seconds between flash shots.  On the L620's menu, you no longer have the option to permanently turn off the dreaded "red eye reduction" double flash and now have to maneuver around it with each flash setting.Nikon should learn that they set the benchmark for AA Lithium cameras with the L610 and that those of us who love it are willing to pay more for significant upgrades- not a stripped out "new" version, with serious flaws, which they've given us in the L620. Nikon usually builds a camera to an excellent standard and not to a price, which they've done here.I returned the L620 for a refund- and am again- happily shooting with my L610, which is a superior camera.

$review_text.: Here is a checklist you should do before buying an over 2 gig drive:1. Is your operating system 64 bit?If so, does it have the latest drivers for the motherboard components to allow the use of over 2 TB drives?2. Make sure your motherboard is within 3 years, and has a bios version that supports over 2 TB drives.3. Learn what GPT is, and make sure you have a disk formatting utility that can install it on a large drive,or go to youtube and learn the steps on how to initialize and format a large drive.4. Make sure that the operating system disk you use to format the drive, if you choose to do it that way, is either Windows 7.1 or 8.Earlier versions don't support over 2 TB drives during intializing and formatting for install.5. If you are not going to use the drive as a boot drive, make sure you can clean the drive, and format it as GPT, after you intialize and format it.6. You can have boot problems if it is formatted with a MBR on the drive.HGST 3.6 gig arrived yesterday. Spent most of the day trying to initialize the entire disk. Would only initialize 1.6 TB, wouldn't see the rest. Tried both machines, no joy.Keep in mind this is on a Gigabyte EX58UD5, i7 940, 12 gigs of ram, and windows 7. Boot is raid 0 two Samsung SSD's.While not cutting edge, it's pretty much blinding, rating 7.9 on windows rating setup, that out of 8.Finally decided to check my bios. It was F3, it's now F13, and supports 3.6 gig drives or larger. It is the latest beta bios. That scared me a bit. bios updates and I have had problems in the past.@bios did the job smoothly.The bios update reset all the bios settings, so I had to redo my raid 0, which worked pretty easily. Just set it in the bios, and the raid was back up and running. Problem was my tech guy had some bios trick that allowed the machine to boot with all 6 2 gig ram sticks, even though it appeared bad sectors were spread out over the ram.It's not pleasant trying to figure out on this machine what is going wrong, as your screen flys through the bios, goes to memory check, and then shuts down. 10 seconds later it tries again, etc.Annoying and a bit scary.Looked in the bios, and slot 3 was dead, no ram showing. So I pulled 3 and 4 and trashed them. Now we got by the memory check, and the machine booted.Still, 7.1 doesn't see the drive.So, gigabytes web page, download and install all the new drivers for my motherboard, and we are up and working seeing the drive.After that I was able to initialize and format the entire drive.That's the good news.The bad is the drive is oem, has an invalid serial number and no warranty.This after going to the HGST website, and calling them.Testing Amazon's return policy on this one...185 dollars for a "new" oem with no warranty?It was listed as "new" with a three year warranty on the website. The invoice indicates otherwise.Company is "ServerTech Solutions, Inc" in Florida.The memory which was never really good, and OCZ's division now only RMA's SSD's pretty much, so the ram is in the trash. OCZ went bankrupt, and their memory business warranty went with it.I also discovered a Seagate 1.5 TB backup drive has gone south, and with it my entire Sean Connery collection. It was out of warranty, and I was hoping to transfer the data to the HGST.Fun computer day...If I had it to do over, I might have just bought two, 2 2TB drives.Make SURE your bios and operating system are totally up to date with the latest drivers, or it's likelyyour computer won't be able to see the large drives. If your motherboard is much older then mine, which is maybe 4 years, don't bother. Unlikely it will work. And, your OS has to be 64 bit to see the large drives.Oh, and they have to be formatted GPT, something I didn't knowuntil yesterday. In the pictured box should be software that allows you to format your drive. It is no longer available fromHGST online, so if you don't get the program on a disk, your out of luck.I downloaded and tried 3 different disk utilities trying to get one that would see the entire drive. Without the cutting edge drivers for Windows SATA, etc. nothing worked.I also tried formatting the disk through command prompt, Disk Management, and the OS.  Know what you are getting yourself intowhen you buy one of these big drives.All that said, I'm paying 50% less then a retail drive, in box, and getting old, new drives.The consensus among my computer friends is keep the drives, if they work out of the box.  Your buying a Toyota, do you really need to pay for a two year warranty?  ServerTech Solutions offers a 3 year warranty from them, on these items. Considering the price, they are worth trying, and, if they arrive in good shape keeping.I also bought a WD RE4 from them, for 100 dollars, thinking I was getting it from Amazon, for a 2TB drive. This drive originally was warrantied for 5 years, enterprise drive.  It's slower the then the HGST, but has a longer original warranty. 100 mb sec vs. 133 mb sec data transfer.I'll post in a while how this works out. The HGST and RE4 have become my two of my three working drives. All important data has been copied to them, and the original, out of warranty disks retired to packing boxes. I plan on buying another RE4 2TB, or maybe another HGST tomorrow.
$SUMMARY.: OEM, no disk with computer program to format GPT, invalid serial number, and no warranty, according to HGST. Mechanically ok

$review_text.: Decent camera when new - but won't stand up to the years of family events. This is the second Canon Powershot I have owned (different models) - both have suffered maintenance and repair issues even though they were well cared for. Both suffered sticking flash pop-up issues; this one (S1 IS) now has started to tint all images purple. Canon has acknowledged this fault (defective Sony CCD) and has offered to repair same free of charge - turns out this is an effort to get folks to send in their cameras and charge for "unspecified repairs". Camera lasted for about 4 years, as did last one.Fool me twice...shame on me...my second Canon product, now my second Canon product with longevity/build quality issues - I won't be buying a Canon again - can't afford to keep buying cameras...

$REVIEW.: I bought this AmazonBasics iPod Touch case mainly because it has Amazon's name on it! But, a few reviews were positives, so I tried it out. It fits very well, and is easy to slip the iPod inside. It would be equally as easy to remove, and I have  not had an issue with the top/bottom slipping out pulling it in and out of my pockets. The tread around the outside edge makes it easy to grasp and hold on to. The silicone makes for a nice non-slip surface, so it won't slide easily in inclined surfaces. I find the volume buttons slightly hard to press, but after using it so much, I know how to hold it right to press them easily.The only slightly negative thing I have to say about this case, is at the bottom where the case covers around the Apple Dock Port. There is a small sliver of silicone that goes across from left to right side of the iPod, and this piece is very mobile, I can see it maybe ripping in half one of these days, but besides that, the case is very solid. They could have fixed this issue by having a cover over the iPod Dock Port, that can be pulled out to plug in/dock. All in all, the case is awesome, and I am very pleased!!!

$review_text.: Having used built-in GPS systems for several years, we were pleasantly surprised at the performance of this product.  It has most of the features of the best systems and clearly stands ahead of some.  Our latest built-in is in a BMW 5 series, and the TomTom beats it hands-down!One of the biggest benefits is the ability to program it in your hand then snap it into place on it's holder.  The screen is a bit small, so this enables the hard work to be done close at hand.  But the screen is very bright with good detail, and the voice directions are excellent, so the small screen size is not a major drawback.The Bluetooth connection to our Motorola 635 was simple, although the phone is not listed as one of those supported.  The only glitch was in the downloading of the phone book - from all appearances it downloaded properly, but no entries were available in the GPS's address book.  Still the hands-free operation is a real plus.  The speaker is good, but it can become difficult to hear when traveling at high speeds or on rough roads.We have not yet attempted to download or update maps, but the data base seems very complete.  I have noted a few glitches at some intersections, but I understand the company's website asks for such comments, so it seems that updates will be made available regularly.Overall it is a very useful product and worth the purchase price.

$REVIEW.: I purchased my iPad for business travel hoping that I could comfortably and easily use it for e-mails, web surfing, watching movies and more. This is a really nice piece of hardware with an excellent design. The touch screen works easily and almost flawlessly. The virtual keyboard is fast and very effective. The display is very pleasing, particularly when playing movies. WiFi operation in my situation was very robust and basically transparent. The iPad is very light and easy to tote around initially. The bundled apps are sufficient for basic computing.On the demerit side, the first issue is that watching movies requires a stand of some sort which leads to a marketplace with solutions that are either expensive, heavy, wobbly or cheesy or all four (and not ideal for travel). I know that there is a cardboard origami solution but I didn't want to deal with that for every trip. The next issue is that it really isn't very comfortable holding the bare iPad for a long time and one worries about scratching the beautiful aluminum case. This leads to a search for a skin or case. I ended up with the InCase Silicone skin which has a very good design that levels out the back of the iPad with molded rubber protrusions. Unfortunately, this also almost doubles the weight of the iPad, negating its weight advantage for travel and lounging around with it. Next, integration with iTunes and a lack of a USB port leaves the iPad user chained to Apple solutions for data transfers with the exception of the camera connection kit. I am in a mixed OS household (Windows and Mac) and this created potential hassles that I didn't want to deal with. Finally, I was surprised by how many mainstream web sites that I went to that were inaccessible because of Flash (and despite Mr. Jobs' assurances otherwise). I returned my iPad after three days. I am sure however, that for many, this will fit the bill either as a third device or for those with the narrow requirements that this device meets.

$REVIEW.: This switch works great!  Really takes the load off of a wifi router with too few wired ports to start with.  Gigabit is obviously a bonus, with so many wired devices leveraging the network within the house.  I also like that some devices that just talk to each other, never have to bounce traffic off this and onto the already busy wifi router.One thing, it does get a little warmer than I thought it would.  Be sure to give it plenty of breathing room, and I wouldn't recommend putting it on top of or below other warm devices...

$review_text.: In spite of less than sparkling reviews from others, I have it a try. I have no idea where the FM antennae is on my Expedition. It's probably embedded in a window somewhere but this Belkin only works well if I hold it up to the windshield near the mirror. Anywhere else and it's too noisy to enjoy. I chose this because some of the higher rated units had to be plugged in to a lighter adapter and I wanted something I could use where there was no 12vdc plugI can't see this being of use unless you live where there are only a couple of FM stations on the air. Otherwise, you'll get bleed through unless you tape it to the radio in the right position. In my car, it's essentially worthless.

$REVIEW.: Great portable stand. In my opinion, the item description nails it. It is very portable when folded up; can be easily tossed in a drawer or bag. It held my iPad perfectly while in its case and is sturdy enough to operate. It didn't slide around the counter tops and is adjustable for different viewing angles. It pretty much suits all of my requirements. However, my one minor complaint is that when the iPad is sitting vertically in the mount and the charging cable is plugged in, the cable interferes with the stability of the iPad. In other words, if the mount held the iPad maybe just a half-inch higher off the surface, the plug wouldn't be a problem. Horizontally is of course no problem. I personally don't find this to be an issue as I seldom have it plugged in when I'm using it anyway.

$review_text.: This item works for almost all purposes. Despite the image showing that it is a class 2 card, I was sent a class 4 card. Even still, it's slightly faster than a class 4 card has to be. Average write speed is 4.31 MB/s and the average read speed is 14.9MB/s. It is much cheaper purchasing it here than in stores or as an add-on with other products (Ex. MP3 player or a Nintendo DS flash card). Just make sure the product you are using it for supports HC cards. It even came with an adapter although the adapter says it's SanDisk, it seems a bit low-res, but it works perfectly.

$review_text.: I really wanted to like this camera/video recorder,  really I did.Is is better than a cell phone camera? most of them yes, but not by much.The problem is that this video/camera is not positioned to compete with cell phones as a camera. Instead this is designed to be the all action sports and outdoor action cam. And this is where it fails on funcationality and features.  If I wanted low quality images to post on the internet as I go, well smartphones actually do a good job, so why buy a camera that has less features than a phone (like being able to actually upload the images without a computer ). Even if I had the wifi version, it still is not providing enough of an improvement to justify having a seperate device.What it does well..  It is waterproof. It does work well in low light. It can detect whether it is vertical or horizontal, and changes display and image orientation automatically.  The form factor is nice, though not entirely intuitive when getting those action shots.  And you can take a photo while recording video.What it does not do so welll.. well everything else.  It impossible to actually catch that action because the display is impossible to use in daylight. Since the digital zoom is controlled from the touch display it is impossible to quickly adjust.The image quality is terrible.. beyond grainy, the camera does not capture or does not record enough information to do anything in software to fix the images. The firmware offers 4 image quality settings, but that does not improve the information recorded, just how much of it you get to see later.  The light/flash has no power and not sure if it would be enough to make it useful underwater.Lacks a memory card slot, which might be because of the waterproof,but doubt it.  So you are out doing action, miles away from your computer, and you can only use the memory in the camera?  well I hope it is an uneventful actionless day.The camera is slow to autofocus.. which means as you are taking that action video.. and change the zoom (if you are that patient and use both hands to block the light so you can see the touch screen) or subject moves, the camera will constantly be refocusing, slowly, and making the worst action video you have ever made.  This is where the touch screen zoom controls fail this, at least if you could quicky do it manually with a button you could have control over it. and make it artistic..This camera/video recorder simply fails to have the features to match how it is positioned in the consumer market.

$REVIEW.: I am quite happy with my Slingshot 200. It is comfy even when packed to the gills. One does have to insure the padded shoulder rest is properly placed. Also, I am a large guy and the straps extend to fit me well.  I like the fact that I can whip it around in front of me and have fast and silent access to my camera and lenses without worry of items falling out and being damaged. I can see wildlife and get my equipment quietly without scary Velcro noises, ect. to avoid frightening away my wildlfie camera subjects.I have also used the bag many times as a good sturdy object to rest my arms on for stability and help reduce shake when taking a picture with a slow shutter speed if I do not have my monopod or tripod. The built in waterproof cover is also a nice to have and eliminates extra worry.Surprisingly, the most important thing I really like is that when I travel. Carry on restrictions are MUCH tighter lately, as to how much an airline allows one to carry onboard. I bring my slingshot and my notebook case for carry on. In addition to my camera body, 2-3 lenses and an extra Canon PowerShot, my slingshot 200 also has room for quite a few other things like my ipod, my portable GPS, cd's or dvd's,  ect..  I can pack all those things in the slingshot when leaving on my trip and not have to put them in checked baggage. I let my slingshot with camera equipment and extra electronics go with me through airline security and it easily passes through, as long as I maintain eye contact on it at all times.  Then it is easy to carry and keep with me without a burden during layovers between flights. I would rather pay the $15 for a checked bag of clothes and carry on my electronics then to risk putting my electronics in stored luggage where they get throw round, and possibly ripped off. Using careful thought about what camera equipment I need to bring allows me to use the slingshot's extra storage for other things.Lastly, I am very impressed with the thought behind the bag, and the build and quality of the materials used. 5 stars for sure. You will not be disappointed.

$review_text.: When looking for my first Professional Video Camera I researched for months, talked to everyone I knew who shot video and had knowledge of these types of cameras and scoured the web hours on end for reviews, information, joining and posting questions on forums and so on.A friend of mine since childhood is a well known independant filmaker and a huge help in directing me towards a camera I could both handle right away and grow with. After deciding against buying a DSLR he suggested I go back and really take a hard look at the feature set of the HMC40. In addition to superb video -the still images are equally impressive and stand up to any high end SLR so it is in every way two excellent cameras in one.Other models with a similar  set of features and perhaps a few more bells and whistles for hard core pros bumped the price up to 3 grand and higher - way beyond my budget and needs. At less than 2 grand the Panny HMC40 was still a reach but it was looking better and better.The camera is intuitive to use, crystal clear results and no moving parts whatsoever. No belts no heads - no internal moving parts at all - one hundred percent a solid state device. To me, this meat two things, much less that break and or go wrong and no internal noise to get picked up by the built in microphone. The camera is built to last and packed with features.I love being able to use memory cards over tape or a hard drive to capture images and sound. Both recording and transfer is effortless. On auto the camera does virtually everything you can think of and more.One other big plus is the internal Mic - it's brilliant. It does a great job capturing rich, clear true stereo sound and is adjustable for wind and ambient noise reduction. At first I thought I would be using the XLR adapter and shot gun mic most of the time, now I rarley if ever attach it.The menu is simple to read, easy to navigate and the LCD screen is always bright and clear - easy to read your recording speeds, sound levels and more at a single glance even in bright light.This is a wonderful camera you can grow with as it's capable of doing so much more than you might expect. The compact design is sleek and impressive, trust me, it gets lot's of stares and questions. Although larger than any camera I've owned it's beautifully balanced, easy to hold and a cynch to take most anywhere.This has much to do with the included handle, which is also great for low shots plus it has a hot shoe for extra lighting or an external mic. Although I have a Panasonic mic adapter and good quality  mic I find myself never having to use them as the internal mic is simply wonderful. The sound is rich and complex and the built in ambient/wind noise reduction is excellent.Low light performance isn't stellar. I would think it's fine for average use, especially if it's not completley dark. But for professional looking night shots you'll need lighting. It's the one disapointment of the HMC40 that really does stand out. In my case almost all my filming is done in a home chromokey studio rigged with plenty of lighting. Or outside events with family and friends. So the poor low light performance wasn't a deal breaker. However if great low light performance is very important to you - and you don't own and or don't wish to invest in proper studio lighting - then this may not be the camera for you.I would also add that Panasonic has dedicated Pro camera Support and they're terrific, I don't say that about tech support in general but this is a welcome exception.You may have to wait a bit but you'll never be rushed off the phone and chances are you'll never hang up frustrated. These folks know their cameras inside and and out and seem to especially enjoy working with a novice like myself. You get a dedicated 800 number and my expericance has really been excellent - I give the Pro camera division of Panasonic the highest marks as they have proven to be just superb.My first camera which came from a seller named Big Value. It nt only defective (the internal mic was broken) it turned out to be a Gray market intended for sale in Asia only - however when the seller refused a replacement or refund Amazon stepped in and corrected the problem.I would say when buying something this expensive it's always best to look for "sold and shipped or fulfilled by Amazon". Because if something goes wrong with a marketplace seller you're at their mercy.**Regarding additional coverage**I had added a four year "accident Protection" plan to my cart because it had the Panasonic logo and I thought it was protection backed by Panasonic. However this was not the case. When I was registering my camera I asked about the protection I had purchased and Panasonic informed me that they don't offer extended protection plans.In fact if your camera shows signs of being repaired or serviced by a third party in this case a company called "Service Net" my 3 year warranty would be void. Considering the average cost of repair out of warranty is $600 and Lens replacement over $1,000 I wasn't going to take any chances however Service Net refused a refund and I had to open an A-Z complaint to finally recieve a refund.Always speak to the OEM regarding extended care plans - period.Under your coverage for this camera every single thing except loss or theft is covered by Panasonic.The HMC40 is a perfect choice for most anyone and well worth the step up from consumer cams that just can't come close to matching the breathtaking picture and sound quality of the AG HMC40. The results, ease of use, short learning curve and after sale support is excellent.This is a brilliant Pro camera in every respect.

$REVIEW.: I bought this mount to hang a Samsung LN52A750, which is a 52" LCD TV from 2008, weighing about 60 pounds


This was my first time mounting a TV on a wall, and was a bit nervous to do it
The installation was easy, and the built-in level ensured I was installing it perfectly level


I was able to secure the mount mostly into studs, the 3 screws at the top, and bottom middle


The two bottom sides, I used drywall anchors


I installed the mount without help, but highly recommend having a 2nd person

It wasn't easy as a one-man job

I did get a 2nd person to actually put the TV on the mount, which was also easy to do
After doing so, we stepped back slowly, crossed our fingers, and hoped it didn't fall
Haha


It's not going anywhere

It's very sturdy


The swivel is nice so you can easily get behind the TV when needed

However, the one negative (why I give 4 stars instead of 5) is I wish it was more flush against the wall when it's pushed all the way in
It seems, the best way to get a TV flush is with the mounts that look like you're hanging a picture
If you get a swivel mount, expect some space between the TV and wall

Overall, this is a good mount, and happy with the purchase.

$review_text.: Nice headset from Turtle Beach. Got these to go with my black ops 2 seeing as it's their theme. They really feel great and the sound is quality. Nice hefty, quality cord that is smaller close to the headset for convenience. In-line dongle for volume control and mic which brings me to probably my only qualm. The game audio wheel is too sensitive so you barely move the wheel turns up or down quick. It's not that bad unless you accidentally bump it and the volume turns off and leaves you wondering why there's no audio or worse it makes it blow your head off lol. Best part is it works with is my new Xbox One but chat does not which I don't use anyway. If you are looking for headset go to turtle beach's website, click the console you want one for (including xbox one and ps4) and it will show all compatible headset so you can compare prices for your price range. Don't fall for feeling like you have to buy the new pricy ones that just came out. Work towards your price range not theirs. That's what a free market  economy is about.

$review_text.: The Moshi iVisor XT for Kindle Fire HDX is like no other screen protector I have used. Instead of a fully clear sheet with adhesive all over, the iVisor XT has a black border surrounding the clear part, and only the border has adhesive. For me, this made it super-easy to install. No matter what I do to prevent it, dust always gets in under screen protectors I install. And so it was here - but I could lift off the iVisor, wipe off the dust, and reapply. No dust and it looked perfect. On the Fire HDX, you would never know that there was an extra piece on there except for the cutout for the camera.In use, the iVisor is essentially invisible - it doesn't call attention to itself at all over the Fire HDX display, Supposedly you can remove the iVisor and wash it if it gets dirty - try that with most screen protectors! The feel is just like glass - smooth and precise.

$REVIEW.: EDIT:  It's been a few months now

I'm still enjoying this little lappy, but the battery life has settled into about 3 hours when doing basic surfing and Office tasks


On the plus side, it's very easy to hook up to my 50" HDTV and stream Netflix
Bought an inexpensive Bluetooth mouse and had no trouble pairing it to this laptop
I was able to peel off most of the undesirable stickers and leave a clean surface for my palm.Does run a little warmer than I initially thought, but so far hasn't proved to be troublesome.Wish the battery life would have stayed longer - otherwise, I'm still enjoying this purchase.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW.I had a little Acer 10.1" netbook for about 6 months

Loved the portability and long battery life, but the small screen and keyboard were killing me, so I sold it


After doing a lot of research, I settled on this as a replacement


This little beauty is SWEET
The keyboard is springy and responsive, it looks SO classy with the brushed silver exterior, photos look amazing on its screen, and it's still small and light enough to drop in a backpack

I considered buying an external DVD, but instead, I just shared the DVD tray on my desktop computer and loaded necessary software (Office 2007 Pro and Photoshop Elements 7) that way
Saved a few $$ by not buying that EDVD.I was a little concerned about the uber-shiny and slippery touch pad, but I've had no trouble with it


I took the advice of someone who posted a review and used the little button above the touch pad to disable it before putting the computer to sleep and I haven't experienced any of the unexpected freezing some other reviews highlight
As others have said, it's a fingerprint magnet, but, hey...it's a touch pad.The left side of the palm rest is a little warmer than the right, but it's not uncomfortable.The web-cam powers right up and the images it produces are great


The built-in mic works fine for sitting a comfy distance away.I charged it up, unplugged it, cranked up the screen brightness, and proceeded to uninstall HP bloatware, install Windows Security Essentials, Office, and PSE 7, watched some CBS videos, watched an hour-long TV show streamed from my desktop PC that I'd recorded via Win Media Center, and still it took over 5 hours to get the battery down to 10%

It took about 3.5 hours to charge it fully again (seemed a little long, but I wasn't in any hurry) and I'm in the process of draining it for the second time

It ran internet videos very smoothly and just had a couple of hiccups on the video coming over my wireless from my desktop


I built a fairly complex, multi-layer image in Photoshop Elements and it was smooth and fast.It's only been a day, but I think I'm going to be VERY glad I made the switch to this machine
I have a couple of HDMI cables on order and can't wait to try connecting it my HDTV and stream Netflix.My only negative is the sticker-fest all over the palm rests
They look like they'd peel off easily, but I tried removing one andit was stuck down so tightly I was afraid I'd be left with just a sticky mess behind, so I left the stickers there.Happy day! Hope this review pushed you over the edge.

$review_text.: Really tried hard to like the P7000, but after one disappointment after another, I'm giving up and going Olympus.  Positives:  sharp images, shoots RAW.  Negatives:  Many.  I found it difficult to shoot manually, or on aperture/shutter priority.  Just don't think the controls/menu are very user friendly.  Also, for some reason, the images quite often turn out over-exposed so I end up setting the dial to underexpose up to 1 stop. Camera seems to suck down battery life.  Lately the battery has been dying with the lens extended in the middle of a shot. Maybe Nikon has improved on this camera with the P7100, but I would not give it a try based on this experience.

$review_text.: As many of you I bought this case for it's impressive cooling performance. I installed my system in the case with an aftermarket CPU cooler and 2 Nvidia GTX 570 graphics cards.This case simply cannot adequately handle the heat buildup between the two SLI cards of this magnitude. My top card was constantly hitting 93 degrees Celsius on 3dMark 11 with the graphics cards fans maxing out. Needless to say this ruled out any overclocking of the video cards. The rest of the system was decently cool, but I believe the problem stems from the motherboard being placed so far above the bottom mounted fans that the air just doesn't flow fast enough in between the two SLI cards.I just switched cases to the Cooler Master HAF X and see a HUGE improvement in my graphics cards temperatures. Idle temperatures are about the same, but my 3dMark 11 temperatures dropped from 93 degrees Celsius to 82 degrees Celsius with graphics fans at 60%!If you are building a high end SLI system this case does not have enough cooling. This case is only adequate for a single card set-up or perhaps a medium build SLI set-up.
$SUMMARY.: Good case, but not for SLI

$REVIEW.: Got one of these for Christmas.  Hands down the best streaming device I've used.  I've tried several solutions.I've got two different Blu-ray players (LG and Panasonic) with integrated support for various streaming services, namely Netflix and Pandora.  These work but the "app stores" these companies offer are pretty limited and usually pretty lame.  Integrated streaming in a Blu-ray player is usually just a "me too" feature, not a differentiator, and it shows.  They have very poor support for streaming local media and filetypes.I experimented with XBMC (XBox Media Center) running on a micro-pc running linux.  It was a fun project but there is no real official support from sites like Pandora and Netflix.  Streaming support for local media is better but overall I found this approach overly complex and more of a PITA than I was willing to endure.  No support for IR remotes either (this was a limitation of the PC I chose but either way it wouldn't be working out of the box).I have a couple of Playstation 3's.  For Netflix and Pandora, it's a split.  The Netflix app works very well but there is no app for Pandora, you've got to use the web browser which is not ideal.  Sony must keep a very tight control over the availability of third-party apps as there are shockingly few available.  Streaming local media is good using something like PS3 Media Server but again, it's been a mixed bag with some file formats not supported and the fact that the PS3 does not support IR remotes means that I can't use my universal remote and have to use either one of the game controllers or the PS3 media remote.Now, the Roku upstages everybody.  The number of "apps", in this case "channels", is impressive.  There are hundreds.  There are even more "private" channels that people have created for various fringe applications.  The Netflix app is as good or better than the PS3 app and the Pandora app is orders of magnitude better than the apps integrated on the LG and Samsung Blu-ray players.  This was all great but then I installed the "PLEX" app which provides streaming of local media.  I installed the Plex Media Server on my Ubuntu 12.10 server.  In a word... wow.  No comparison to anything else I've used for streaming local files.  My movie library is presented very similarly to the way Netflix presents movies, including cover art.  There's an Android (and IOS) app for Roku that works excellently.LG, Samsung, Sony dabble with third-party apps and local streaming but its not their focus (lets face it, these features are required for them to compete with each other but they don't necessarily equate to profit).  On the contrary, for Roku their ecosystem is built on and encourages third-party content and apps.  I'm thoroughly impressed and very satisfied, especially when you consider the price of this little thing.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent streaming device

$REVIEW.: I had read, in a photography forum, that this brand is a great, inexpensive alternative to original Olympus batteries, so I bought this set of two batteries, plus charger, for my Olympus OM-D E-M1 camera


The good news? The Wasabi batteries work, and they provide a backup for when the Olympus BLN-1 battery is drained


But I'd never buy these batteries again for the simple reason that in use, they're quickly depleted

They power the camera for a fraction of the time that the BLN-1 does, and I have to swap them out frequently when they're drained

I'm getting less than 50 shots per Wasabi battery

I'd rather spend more money for an original Olympus battery and feel confident that I'll be able to shoot for an entire extended session without having to swap out dead camera batteries.

$REVIEW.: The Fujifilm FinePix S3200 may have some bells and whistles, but it isn't a good camera.  I've put it through a workout over the past two days, taking hundreds of photos in different lighting conditions, and have not been at all pleased with the performance.  The focus is off.  The left third of almost all of my pictures is blurry.  Some shots are entirely blurry, even when using the flash.  I took a picture of my child and while the background 30 feet away was in focus, my son (who was front and center) was not.  Photos are grainy starting at ISO 400.  The panorama feature does not correctly line up the photos.  Some of the panoramas would have been comical, if I hadn't been so disgusted with myself for spending money on this camera.  Forget low-light images -- they're unusable.  My Canon PowerShot S50 is on its last legs, but even it takes better pictures than this one.  I'm very disappointed and will be returning the camera.
$SUMMARY.: Not worth the money.

$REVIEW.: I absolutely love this case. I will start my review by saying I HATE cases. I keep my iPhone in a sleeve, I keep my computer in a Sleeve, etc.... so I was looking for a slip case when I found this. I read the reviews saying how minimalistic it is, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.I've had it for 2 months now. Wow, I LOOOOVE it! It's so so slim, yet protects like no other. It's designed by Amazon for their own product, so the fit is 100% perfect, and the quality is outstanding. The front has gotten a bit scuffed up from being in my bag and on airplanes every day, but I bought it to protect the device, so it's doing what it was designed to do.I would highly recommend this case over any others!

Although some reviewers wrote that the cover does not automatically turn on their Paperwhite that has the ad (with a savings of $20), mine turns on and off without doing anything other than opening the cover.It is leather but I would prefer it to be a little less slippery although that may make it more difficult to slip into my jeans pocket, which can be easily done with the cover on the Paperwhite.The cover grips the Paperwhite very securely with no danger of its falling out - ingenious, actually.The magnetic clasp also works very well. I have  not dropped the Paperwhite yet but I have no doubt that the cover will protect it if I do.I highly recommend this cover.

$REVIEW.: This really isn't as bad as I thought it would be. The keyboard is small, and Logitech has made some weird choices in the design of it, but overall, the keyboard is satisfactory. I am a fast touch typist, and this keyboard toes the trick. (I am typing this review on it now!) The most annoying thing is that the left side of the keyboard has been condensed, so the 1 key does not align in the proper place, and the tab key is a function of the oversize A key. However, once you get used to it, it works pretty well. The battery life is impressive, as is the material quality. The back is made from the same aluminum as the iPad, and is the same high quality as the iPad, so it compliments it nicely. Oveall, a pleasant surprise, and works more than sufficiently to make the iPad mini a true mini laptop for travel or on the go.

$review_text.: UPDATE FEB 2014: All good things must come to an end... After a several month love affair with my pOp, it up 'n died. Rest in peace little guy. I only downgraded you one star for your early demise (from four to three) because of all the good times we had :'(ORIGINAL POST:This thing is perfect for me. I listen to a lot of audio (podcasts/music) via my smartphone, and though the phone's internal speaker is loud enough coming from a breast pocket while I'm in a quiet room, it just doesn't do the trick when water is running, a fan is on, I'm near traffic, or wind is rushing through my car window. I've been looking for a bluetooth speaker for a while now, but just haven't been motivated to buy any until I saw the AudioSource Sound pOp reviewed on TWIT TV (GizWiz show), after which I made an impulse buy here on Amazon. I'm glad I did...What I love:1) Suction Cup... Magnificent Idea. I carry it everywhere and stick it to everything -- The sun roof, side window, or windshield in my car; Fridge; Shower wall; Coffee Table; Even the back of my smartphone or tablet and use it as a stand - Perfect.2) Size... Fits in pants pocket. TWIT TV described it as the size of a baseball, but it's smaller, and it tapers in from the middle.3) Water resistant... I pop it onto the wall in the shower (not in direct flow)4) Richness of sound... amazing bass for such small and light speaker.5) Volume... Many times louder than my phone, tablet, or even laptop speakers6) Feel/Durability... covered in water-resistant thermoplasic rubber (TPR) that provides grip (and protection from drops).7) The price... a steal.What I'm not in love with...1) The speaker phone function. The volume of the caller is woefully inadequate (volume maxed on phone and speaker). They can hear me very well, but I have to hold the pOp to my ear to hear them (like I'm using a 1930's era phone)2) When I first got it, every piece of dust or pet hair around me stuck to its rubbery surface like a magnet and was hard to wipe off. This problem is mostly gone now, though. Perhaps the oils from my hands have "demagnetized" it (ewwwww)3) Suction release tab. It's a small tab along the outer edge of the cup which releases suction immediately with a light tug, but it's a clumsy move for my large hands to get to it, resulting in the pOp falling to the floor more than a few times already.What YOU may not love...1) No physical plug if your device doesn't have bluetooth. This doesn't matter at all to me, I bought it for cordless convenience.2) The pOp is advertised to last "up to" 8 hours of play... I get 4 to 5. But I mostly always max the volume. Enough for me.3) Mono... No capability to pair with another for stereo. But I love the richness of sound nonetheless.4) The micro usb port door... It's a small rubbery flap to seal the port, and it covers it sufficiently, but it doesn't seem to "snap" shut perfectly. I don't care about that, because it's enough to repel moisture, and I won't be running this thing directly under the water. The speaker grill holes, though relatively small, still seem big enough to take in water, so I'd be careful even without this "flaw" -- The pOp is  advertised as water-resistant, NOT water-proof.Verdict: I bought this thing as a convenient BT speaker for personal wireless podcast/music listening everywhere, not for phone calls, stereo thrill, or parties. The richness of sound coming from the pOp is amazing to me. I'd always heard not to expect that over bluetooth, so maybe my expectation was a bit low, but it IS good. I'm equally enamored with the lowest tech feature of the thing -- That suction cup so I can secure it almost anywhere and not have to worry about balancing acts. The surface must be smooth, and a little moisture on the cup will help secure it more strongly (like any other suction cup), but believe it or not, that feature alone pushed me over the edge to impulse buy. I'm very happy with my pOp.

$REVIEW.: Well I just installed it as a replacement and as a Tech guy I can tell you it is one of the quietest I've ever heard, or maybe I should say not heard.  Quick and smooth installation with all the connections you might need. 2 PCIe connectors if you need them for a dual video set up.  SO far I am more than happy with it, but of course only long term use will really tell on a power supply so I only gave it 4 stars. I tell you what though, I was very impressed with the packaging it came in. It was very snug in a nice box with bubble wrap tight on the PS. If you have seen as many Power supplies as I have you know  that some are just tossed in the box, however it did not come with any "instructions"  so if you don't know about power supplies, don't get it expecting even the simplest instruction.I'll update this later if I have any problems with it.One thing I do want to say negative is about the shipping..It took less time for it to get delivered to the town I live in then to be delivered by UPS. (one day shipping)  According to the tracking info (ordered on my wifes account) it went out for delivery at 7:39 am and it was not delivered until about 7:15 that evening...Now thats almost 12 full hours..Is this a single driver making deliveries all those hours ?  Doesn't this lead to a little fatigue ?  Anyway 12 hours to deliver something it would have taken me 15 minutes to go pick up at the UPS facility is just not right for my money..If UPS is that busy on a Wednesday then maybe they should think of hiring more people on some routes ?

$REVIEW.: I also have the Logitech Comfort Lapdesk which is by far the most elegant in laptop pads I've seen. The problem is that even with the mesh material, the heat on your legs will eventually build up especially with the weight of the laptop resting on it then pushing down on you.This Logitech Cooling Pad N100 has a different kind of sleek design with a pastel two-tone colour as well as the addition of slotted grilles for the fan. It provides a quite cooling effect via piggy-backing on the power supply of your notebook. You plug the USB cord and it draws 5V @ 200mA. Air is drawn from the rear and onto the underside of the laptop.The problem is that to maintain a balance of silent cooling and power consumption, then power to generate much airflow is compromised. But if you factor in the slotted vents, then I'm sure temperature is slightly lowered. I would have preferred going one step further from the Comfort Lapdesk model and building an aluminum base to create a passive cooling as well as an active fan that can only do so much without drawing too much power from the laptop's battery.How about the ability to control fan speed not by a clunky switch, but by a rotating dial so speed is adjusted in a limitless way. Lots of better design options that they could have gone, but they didn't.In the meantime, I'll stick to my equally ergonomic and better designed, Logitech Comfort Lapdesk. It fits with any interior and can be tucked away horizontally or vertically.UPDATE: DEC 6, 2009With two laptops in the house, I had to give the comfortable Logitech Comfort Lapdesk to my wife for her to use and I'm stuck with with plastic two-tone Cooling Pad. I'm honestly surprised both products came from the same company or that the Logitech Comfort Lapdesk came from Logitech.This Logitech Notebook Cooling Pad (N100) I'm starting to hate more and more everyday the more I use it.- For one, the stylised bottom curve that creates space for the airflow is questionable for the way the laptop rests. It doesn't allow the base of the laptop to sit flat and thereby may cause stress than support.- There are two big rubber stoppers to help the laptop stay in place and not slide, but there needs to be the same big rubber stoppers at the front portion because the laptop is basically rubbing against the hard plastic and if you have an aluminum MacBook Pro model, can cause scratching in time.- No comfortable padding at all for your legs. It's just hard brutal plastic construction.- You can't make this stand vertically the way the Logitech Comfort Lapdesk is capable of.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this at all. I knocked down one more star as it's hanging on for dear life in design and usefulness factor.

$REVIEW.: I bought my A3 way back in Nov '07 when they had the get 10 free deal. I've been using my RCA HDV5000 as my HD player and was saving the A3 as a back-up unit but after seeing so many horror stories here I got worried so I open up the box and took it over to a buddies house to watch the new BLADE RUNNER HD set on his 37 inch HDTV. All I had to do was plug it in and hook up one HDMI cable. Turned the power on. 45 seconds later the disc door opened. I put in the disc and was watching the movie 15 seconds later. BLADE RUNNER HD played without a glitch. No firmware needed. eject was quick and the next disc took about 15 seconds to load. At home I swapped the A3 for the RCA 5000. I watched both 300 & Borne without any problems. Great DVD player. Makes my regular stuff look HD. Real HD DVDs look really fantastic. My HD TVs at home are 24" LCD , 30" CRT, 42" LCD.This A3 was tested on a 37 and 42 inch LCD and looks great on both.

$REVIEW.: I got my hands on this tripod (along with a Vanguard SBH-250 Magnesium Ball Head) a few days ago and have been loving life ever since. Not only is it sturdy and my camera feels secure attached to it (even with my heaviest lens, the Sigma 50-500mm), but it can bend and twist in ways I've never seen a tripod move. If you have enough room, it gives you the ability to have your camera and lens only an inch or two off the ground, or way up high (perfect for tall people) if necessary. It also comes with a level, which is VERY helpful when positioning the legs. The carrying case is nice quality, and it even comes with a bag for weights (at least I'm pretty sure that's what it is.... the manual certainly didn't help me figure that one out).Unfortunately the manual is not super-helpful. You will have to study those pictures long and hard to figure out what they're trying to tell you, or you can just start playing with it and figure it out on your own. Don't EVER force anything. I discovered that buttons and levers work smoothly as long as the tripod is in the correct position for those things to operate as intended.As for the weight, in my opinion it's not that heavy, but if you're walking all day carrying your gear AND the tripod, I imagine it can become somewhat of a burden. It depends on your tolerance. The good thing is that it comes with a really nice carrying bag which you can fling over your shoulder.All in all this tripod is an engineering wonder and in my opinion a great addition to one's photo gear.

$review_text.: We have a little boy and my parents raised me to be inquisitive about everything; I want my boy to experience the wonders of creation as well. When I saw the Celestron 44104 on the GBDOTD, I looked through the reviews and decided that the 'scope sounded like a good value-purchase. One attractive feature is the ability to use other objective lenses to increase the magnification level.Since neither my field of study nor my profession led me to much microscope use, I needed to look around the Internet and through the instruction manual to re-familiarize myself with controls and slide-making procedures. The 'scope is heavy and seems very sturdy. So far, after about a month of use, I have not been annoyed or found lacking any of the controls. It's very easy to focus in on slides and the quality of lenses appears to be very clear and distortion free to me. Since I had no dislikes and think the scope can grow with my interests and last my son through high school and into college, I feel like it deserved 5-stars for its price and purpose.I would recommend this microscope to anyone else who has a tangential interest in the microscopic world and a desire for high magnification levels. I would also warn against looking at certain creepy crawlers through this as you may look at the world in a different way after seeing them.
$SUMMARY.: Amateur hour at the microscope club

$review_text.: I don't know what went wrong - they were working fine this morning and tonight the volume simply wouldn't rise about the lowest setting.  I've played with everything I could, but they seem dead.  Just plunked down a big chunk of change for the latest and greatest version which I really couldn't afford right now, but I can't live without the headphones!  That's how good they are.  I bought these to replace a Panasonic set from a few years back, and have mostly been happy with them.  The range could be better, and the signal strength fades in and out upstairs, but it hasn't been a huge problem.  I use them to listen to satellite radio as I wander around the house doing chores or when I'm lying in bed.  Sometimes out on the patio when I'm working the grill or reading a book.  They were great for this purpose, and while not noise cancelling, still acceptable.Wish they were still under warranty.

I recently reorganized my stuff and will be moving it again once I hang my new tv on the wall.  I was finding that using the binding post was a real pain in the a$$ trying to fit my hand in the back of the cabinet and then trying to tighten the post.  The plugs will save me a lot of time.  My only thought when I was putting one on at the speaker is that the barrel is not insulated and could be shorted if not carefully handled if you should unplug while the unit is on, volume up.  I always turn off my unit when working with the speaker wires so that is not an issue for me.  I may have to buy more to finish off my project - to put the kitchen and yard speakers on plugs from their present spring clip connectors.

$review_text.: Very easy to apply the first time. If you have a new Pod, remove the protective cover on the device and give it a quick wipe with the supplied cloth. Remove the clear shield protective cover on the matte shield, be careful to align the protector right and apply as directed (lift it up and straighten as needed and reapply). You can see it attach itself with no bubbles as it goes on. The included card worked great for the few tiny bubbles that were on the sides. It has a non-reflective matte finish, that is not dectectable when the unit is on. Highly recommended and would buy again. I do not know why it comes with 3 but it doesn't matter. Arrived fast with 2-day Prime in a bubble envelope. The matte cover is thicker and easier to apply than other, thin, cheaper shields.

(and I don't have to replace my phones with newer phones which are expensive and unimpressive in both feature set and design.)*** UPDATE 12/18/11:  Happy Holidays!

There are alternatives out there that one could possibly find for less money, but many alternatives are around this price range, or higher.If you know enough to know that you needed this adapter in the first place, then you probably don't need to know much more

$review_text.: As a digital photographer for more than 10 years, I thought I would get this camera for my wife as a replacement for her Panasonic Lumix. I was terribly disappointed with the quality of the pictures - especially for portraits - and I expected a lot more from a CMOS sensor. RAW format? Customized by Fuji. I don't know why other reviewers mentioned that it's impossible to take bad pictures with this camera. I tried to take only good pictures, and put my experience with professional cameras to the test, yet I still managed to get quite a few bad shots even after reading the instructions and using the camera for more than 2 weeks. Yes, you may not need to enlarge pictures and for 4x6 prints most of them look great. The 15x zoom is great. The video - you can forget about - especially if you plan on taking indoor videos, as the camera keeps on focusing and focusing...like the energizer bunny. I returned it to my favorite store and I am expecting a refund any day now.

$review_text.: PP= Post Processing (Photoshop and other image apps)PQ= Picture QualityMy older brother, who by no means is a professional but has been an enthusiast since my father gave him his old Canon F series 35mm SLR in the 80s, has been my mentor.He currently uses a 20D with a 420EX flash and some ungodly multi thousand dollar L series lenses.  I recently purchased the E-500 dual lens kit for a fraction of the cost and must say that my brother and I both agree it is by FAR the best bang for the buck.At the level 98% of us are at it is all user error and not camera error when our pictures don't come out as we would like (most professionals even say its mostly user error or lack of knowledge).  I still have a friend who uses a small 2001-Canon S230 and takes pictures that are far better then most of mine.In low light I have noticed that my E500 does not focus as fast as my brothers 20D (but it definitely still focuses) but from reading online with firmware upgrades they remedied this problem in the E300.We both also agreed that it felt better in our hands (grip and general ergonomics) and was quite a bit lighter then the 20D as well.He ,just as myself, LOVED the rear LCD controls for everything from ISO to flash speed and exposure, far more easier and quicker then the 20D for a newbie such as myself.  But he commented saying it would have been nice if it had the small simple LCD up top that the canons do as a supplement to the detailed and informative one of the back.PQ was amazing requiring very little PP, and with the vivid setting we both agreed that the colors did feel better and more vibrant (of course with a small PP Tweak the 20D was right there but for the casual photographer as myself I shy away from PP).Bottom line we were both floored at what a phenomenal deal this kit is for the price.---------- UPDATED 3/29/2006 ------------Everything said above still holds true, and I must say this is one of the few purchases that almost 6 months later Im still VERY happy with and use it frequently.  Through no advertising or sales pitch I have created 3 new customers for Olympus's E500 kit up to date.My brother has over $4000 now invested in his camera and he still finds it amusing that my little old $700 kit gets as much attention from all our friends as it does.  He recently upgraded to the 580EX flash and a new Wide angel L series lens, and I must admit VERY VERY amazing hardware bursting 3 or 4 pictures WITH flash is very cool.But we recently went to India to tour Agra, see the Taj Mahal, Sikhanders tomb, and other such sites on the way.  At the end of the trip without PP during the day my pictures looked better (we both agreed) and thats all I cared about (mainly talking about color saturation and not detail, just over all presentation).  I will admit though in a couple action shots from our speeding bus his camera did perform better, and in the evening some of mine didnt focus properly while his did on the same subject, but Im not a pro, I just enjoy the hobby.One of my better purchases in recent years.His camera IS better, mine is just a better deal, it's all about peace of mind..

$REVIEW.: I reasearched quite a bit before buying this TV. It is a great value. Looking at TVs on display in stores, other LCDs didn't have very dark blacks and a lot had those weird pixelly trails when there was fast motion. The 37HL67 doesn't have either of these problems. It has a great picture - bright, good color and contrast. The controls are easy to use. The picture and built in sound are great.

$review_text.: I usually wearShure SE535-V IEM'sat home, andMonster Copper Turbine Pro'sat work. While they're both pretty great IEM's, the included tips (yeah, even Monster's incredible selection of includedMonster Foam SuperTips) have nothing on these. I'm not sure what kind of special Unobtanium these are made from, but I've never felt another material quite like it.IEM's normally make my ears feel warm and itchy after about an hour or so, but I can use them for hours with these tips. And although I'm hesitant to say that they're doing much for audio quality on higher-end earphones, the wax guard is an absolute godsend, and worth the money for that feature alone.The only caveat I've found, is that the Large size could be a tiny bit bigger -- which is strange, because I usually wear a medium in every other tip I've used. So, if you're used to wearing large tips, these may actually be a little small. And if you normally wear medium, you might want to go a size up.

$review_text.: Lately, I have been obsessed with finding good covers for my various electronic products.  I saw this product for the Kindle Fire and I decided to try it out.This is a great product.  I like the idea of screen protectors.  Since these toys are not cheap, and it is actually fairly easy to cause scratches, protection is a plus.  However, my previous experiences with protectors have been frustration in trying to apply the item correctly, and an inability to reapply the item if a corner happens to come up.  Not here.1.  What is in the box?  You receive the screen protector and a cloth to wipe the screen clean of dust before application.2. Ease of application?  This was very easy.  After wiping the screen clear, I simply took off the backing matierial off the protector and laid it on the Kindle.  I made a slight mistake, and easily picked up the protector again and it stuck easily.3.  Aesthetic and use:  This is an anti-glare protector.  As such, it does create a cloudiness to the screen that was not there before.  However, this does help cut down in glare from lights and actually helps somewhat from sunlight (remember that this is a backlit device so it is impossible to eliminate issues with glare.  However, it does seem to help quite a bit in eliminating glare.  As I use this item almost exclusively as a e-reader, this is a help, not a burden.  I have had absolutely no issues with the touchiness of the screen when using this item, and I daresay it might actually help this device a bit.Overall:  I was skeptical originally about this item, but it is easy to apply, I had no issues with bubbles on the screen, and it does help eliminate glare.  Keep in mind that using this will make the screen a little less sharp than without the item, but you do gain an ability to use the Kindle in areas of brighter light.I love this item.  I think the price of 10ish is appropriate for the item and I believe it is a good bonus to the Kindle Fire.********Update:Okay, I have to state that while I like the anti-glare aspect of this screen, it does cut down on the sharpness of the product somewhat.  It is a tradeoff.  So, if you like looking at a sharp screen, you may find objection to this item, FYI.

Lightweight and all flash memory


Best for running, working out, etc


It's simple to just drag and drop the music onto the drive


No wrestling with iTunes or other proprietary players

Easy and cheap.**UPDATE**I got a pair of nice headphones (AKG Q701's) and an amplifier

Put Rockbox on this thing to play FLAC files and it's pretty good
Lots of additional features like LastFM scrobbling and on-the-go playlists and file management

I definitely recommend putting Rockbox on this thing! It adds a lot of features! It probably voids your warranty and blah blah

But its a refurbished, so no warranty voided anyway.

Fortunately my Vizio TV remote was able to operate it using a Toshiba VCR Universal code (See Vizio manual). Toshiba take note!, fix the remote (listen to the Voice of the Customer).2) The manual is a little vague, I can see why people might have problems setting up the DVR, especially if you are not used to a Windows menu type system.Other than that it's a very nice system./Brian

But the instructions stated that I should have seen the Bluetooth Radio AMP in the device manager. I unplugged the adapter and reinserted it into the USB then it appeared like the instructions stated. But later Windows kept saying that there was an unrecognized USB device and removed the Bluetooth Radio AMP and replaced it with a Generic Bluetooth Adapter. After that I could not get the Bluetooth Radio AMP to show up. The device seems to be working ok. I did go out to the website for updating the drivers, but also was unable to find drivers for the device. I want to try using this to connect to a Bluetooth XBee Shield and I don't have that yet, so I may be back to update this later.

$REVIEW.: I had been using one of these devices for several years, but suddenly started getting a BSOD on bootup, with the Stop Error implicating "rt2500usb.sys".  That file is installed by the Linksys adapter, so it was natural to suppose that the cause was a software issue.  After various tests, however, I determined that the physical adapter had become defective.  A new one solved the problem.  If you have a similar issue, I recommend uninstalling the old Linksys software and using the software provided with the new device -- it's likely to contain some fixes.Incidentally, the price on this item seems to fluctuate widely and suddenly.  Just two weeks ago I purchased it directly from Amazon for $32.98, but it's currently being offered by other merchants at mostly higher prices.

$review_text.: When serendipity rules your life and electronic items, there are several ways this can go:1. iPod is uncharged, mophie is at home.2. Both iPod and mophie are fully charged when I get to the gym.3. Both iPod and mophie are uncharged when I get to the gym.4. IPod is uncharged, mophie is fully charged but the cord to connect them is at home on my desk.This is how it works if you leave Murphy in charge of your electronic devices. Eventually however, I found myself at the gym with an uncharged ipod and a charged mophie. It was great - not only the sense of organization that caused me to have the two items in their proper orientation -- but also that I was finally able to use it in the way it was intended.However, as soon as I used it I discovered there is a problem with the battery charge received from this unit. I don't know how the ipod could say that it is fully charged, but then be completely drained in 36 hours after normal use.In 24 hours after fully charging my iPod with the mophie, the charge was 38% and at 30 hours it was 20% and it was dead at 36. I tried this several times and got roughly the same numbers whether using my iPod, my 15YO's, or my husband's. They were always dead within 36 hours after a full charge from a fully charged mophie.16 hours after charging my iPod on the computer it was 100% even though I had used it several times during the day to listen to a book and to play music at the gym. 30 hours later after doing the same activities, my iPod was at a 98% charge. Watching the iPod go down in power is like trying to figure out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop. I seriously can't say how long it took but it was well over a week.I don't know how this item could provide a charge that says it is at 100% but still drain so completely. This does not make it any less convenient; however, it does cause me pause before I use it.

Sandisk definitely knows that feeling for gamers of the Nintendo Wii. Their 2.0 GB Memory Cards are perfect for holding onto memory for Wii games like The Legend Of Zelda Twilight Princess, and Excite Truck. It is also good for storing data from games from the Nintendo gamecube library on the Wii, and classic games that you can download from the virtual console like Super Mario 64, and Bonk's Revenge from the classic Turbo Graphics 16 era.

$review_text.: Wow.  This is a truly amazing little camera.  I bought this to replace my Nikon Coolpix.  I had my coolpix for just over 12 months when it broke, due to no fault of my own, and it was going to cost $150 to repair.  Rather than repair a camera that I liked but didn't love, I decided to make a new purchase.My initial intention was to purchase a Canon Rebel, I have used my mom's in the past and really love that camera.  I loved using the interchangeable lenses and the ability to manually focus.  Seeing the cost though ($500+,) plus the cost of additional lenses, it just wasn't in my price range at the moment and I needed a new camera urgently.  If you're looking for a DSLR, do not expect this to function the same.  It's a powerful little camera, but it is NOT a DSLR.  If you're an amateur photographer and have no intention of taking a class to learn how to use the functions of a DSLR, this is a perfect camera for you.So began my research.  It became a toss up between the Canon SX510 and the Nikon L820.  Reviewers were split between the two, some preferring the Nikon, some preferring the Canon.  They seemed to come out about even except in a few minor categories, and having been very pleased with the Canon Rebel, I decided to go with the Canon despite it costing about $30 more than the Nikon.Pro's-*30x Optical zoom - awesome, no more grainy pictures of kids on stage during performances*Built in wifi - go ahead and upload your pics to facebook, send them to your phone, or directly to your wireless printer.*Manual setting - can do your own iso settings, white balance, shutter speed etc.  The auto setting works fabulously in most cases, far better than any camera I've ever owned, but the option is there for those times it's just not adjusting quite how you want it.*CMOS sensor provides for a clearer image, especially on the macro setting, than my own eyes give me.*Zoom assist - for when you use your 30x zoom but lose your subject*Size - for anyone that has gone hiking with a DSLR and multiple lenses, you know what a pain that can be.  This lighter camera is perfect for running around and still has a lot of the qualities that you'd look for in a DSLR.  So unless you're out taking professional shots, this comes in really handy*Discreet mode - This is a setting on the dial, great for those events when there is no flash allowed.  In this mode, the camera doesn't make noise when turning it on, nor does the flash go off.  Even if the camera goes off and you turn it back on, because it is set on the dial, it doesn't reset itself.  I've accidentally had my flash turned back on so many times that way on previous cameras.Cons -*Very poor manual - A lot of skipping around to get one thing done.  IE Looking through the start up manual, it says "for instructions on attaching (the lens cap cord and neck strap) please see the user manual on the canon website"  Granted, it wasn't difficult to figure out, but there was no clear spot for the lens cap cord, and it is something that should have been included in a "start-up" manual.  Another example of a poor manual, referring to the downloadable pdf manual...say you want to learn how to use the miniature setting...so it says "miniature setting, pg 48"  You go to pg 48 and it says to follow steps 1 and 2 on page 46....okay back to page 46, got that down, back to page 48.  It seems to be this way when trying to learn how to access any of the features.  I can't fault the actual camera for this, but definitely Canon.  I actually made up my own cheat sheet for accessing my favorite features until I have it down.*No ability to manually focus - Being that this camera is not a DSLR, I didn't expect or really even hope for this feature.  I would have liked it, but for the $$, I definitely can't complain and will upgrade in the future.*Mirrorless - I would definitely prefer to use a viewfinder, I am used to going without though, so it's easy to work around.*No Raw Shooting - this feature doesn't apply to most people, but sometimes I prefer to use it*No Touch Screen - This is taking time for me to get used to, I find myself constantly tapping the screen.  My last 2 cameras, going back to 2010, have been touch screen, so I'm surprised to find this camera doesn't have one.Some reviewers have complained about the difficulty of accessing the wifi, this was fairly easy for me and took about 15 minutes max.  It's a little more work than it typically takes to connect a device to wifi,and you have to use the computer to do it, but it's still not overly difficult.Despite the cons, I'm still incredibly impressed with this camera and it has definitely earned 5 stars when taking into account the type of camera, the construction, and the value.  I'm very happy with this purchase despite the fact that I was hoping for my next camera to be the Rebel.  I never imagined I'd get a camera of this level of quality for under $400.  (I paid $229, could have bought a slightly cheaper one, but wanted one that was Amazon fulfilled and prime)
$SUMMARY.: 5 Stars so far, truly impressed

$review_text.: I bought this keyboard to use with my windows 7 HP laptop connected with my TV that sits 10 or more feet away.  I will very strongly recommend this product (I usually write reviews after using the products for several months).  Here are my reasons:1.  It smells of quality.  The product is light and sleek.  When it arrived everything --from packaging to product-- looked good.  Even the tiny wireless receivers that insert into the laptops USB port are beautifully designed.2.  The whole assembly took about 2 minutes or less and the keyboard worked in one shot.  No hassles whatsoever.  It worked with both my HP and dell laptops without a hitch.3.  The keyboard's solar cells work perfectly.  I have the usual indoor lights and have never had any problem using this product.4.  The wireless mouse (a sister product from Logitech) works perfectly.5.  Not interested in consuming too many USB ports on the PC, I used an old USB port multiplier sitting unused for several years (5+).  The keyboard and mouse worked without a hitch.6.  This is the clincher.  Often times when you leave things unused for several weeks, something or the other goes wrong.  I did not use the product for about a month due to an extended absence.  When I returned, everything including the mouse worked without any hiccup or delay.7.  Not having to worry about changing batteries is a great benefit.

$REVIEW.: I took the plunge and bought a Zune and boy is this one fun little device.The display is very crisp.  The user interface is so intuitive that I can't believe it's a Microsoft product.  The firmware updates bring free additional features, improvements and games.  Wifi sync saves me yet another cable lying around.  And for someone who just started working out, the slimmer 16GB works much better than the bulky 30, 80 or 120GB Zunes I see guys have strapped awkwardly to their arms.With the built-in FM tuner, I get all the channels in the gym.  Jumping to the next song is as easy as a simple tap - no need to pull it out and fiddle with it for most functions.  The sync interface (Zune software) on the PC is really crisp and doesn't try to install additional browsers or software like a competing product.  I'm getting tons of free audio and video podcasts, my own videos and over 1500 of my own songs and am only using half the space.Minus 1 star for a lack of built-in Equalizer (EQ) or presets - and for the step down in earbud quality from previous models.  Even with the lack of an EQ - normally a deal killer for me - the sound was good enough that I really couldn't gripe.  After I picked up someJBuds J2 Premium Hi-FI Noise Isolating Earbuds (Onyx Black), the sound was so good, I didn't even notice the missing EQ.Haven't used the social features (like trading files, friends lists, etc.) so I can't speak to those.  But as a slim, sexy, very small MP3 player, this takes the cake.
$SUMMARY.: Great Slim Sleek Player

$review_text.: TOUCH-screen: doesn't work wellI got this for the touch-focus, which seems to work okMy quibble is the touch-screen meniI like spot-metering but each time the camera comes on, I have to switch from evalutative (apparently, that's the default metering mode)Trouble is, the metering mode is at the top of the row of iconsAnd as I touch-screen my way to the metering mode, I seem to always end up re-setting something I didn't mean toAnd because the touch-screen's not that well-made, it takes quite a while to get to the settings that I wantI can't say how this touch-screen compares to smartphones - I don't use touch-screen phonesThe other problem is the lensAt the widest angle of view, the maximum f\stop is 2.7When I shoot after dark without flash, the shutter speed is always more than a second - impossible to handhold(Because the shutter speed can't be controlled manually, I'm entirely at the camera's mercy)The Ricoh PX I use - costs a lot less - has a maximum aperture of f\3.9That's almost one stop slowerBut somehow, with the PX, shutter speeds vary from 1\5 to 1\7 - which is tricky but possible to handholdI'm sure that in daylight, the camera works fineJust as long as you don't want to change settings

$REVIEW.: The first thing I have to say is :wow. This small box truly amazed me. Whatever magic they put into that miniscule box turned a $10 pair of over-ears into my best pair of headphones. It made the volume much louder, and the overall sound more profound. I had originally bought this to have more bass in my songs, and it more than delivers. This thing really puts out some low bass. If you like to listen to dubstep on a budget, these will make the experience much better. However, there is one problem with it, and it's a pretty big one. After some trial and error, I deduced that if your headphones have a volume adjuster/iPod controls In-line on them, then this will make the sound terrible and gross. It sounds like the music is being played out of a tin can radio receiving major amounts of static. This basically rules out Skullcandy all together, but if you don't have any controls you won't be disappointed. I very highly recommend it. If I could suggest one thing, it would be to get a cable that is gold plated on the jacks. I experienced some static with the included cable when there was no music playing and I was walking, but it's not unbearable.
$SUMMARY.: Truly amazing, but there is one fatal error.

$review_text.: I had one set of these headphones with charging base and enjoyed them very much.  I wear a hearing aid without feedback.  I did go to a thrift store and bought a cheap set of headphones for the foam ear pads on them and put them on the Sennheiser which made them more comfortable and fit better and got better sound quality as a plus.  I live in an elderly apartment complex with people who like to complain about noise so this has been an excellent purchase for me.  So well that I bought and extra set of headphone.

$review_text.: I had to return my first copy. There was a significant sized black particle in the lens. My second copy is great.  It is my preferred walk-around lens.The pictures are clear and sharp.The AF is fast.The OS (IS in Canon lens) is great, not too noisy in opinion.Build quality is outstanding.Comes with a lens hood.My only concern about this lens or any other Sigma lens is their quality control(or lack of one).  My other Sigma lens(150-500mm) had air bubbles in the lens. So there really is an issue with quality control. Would have been 5 stars if not for this reason.

$REVIEW.: If you want a music player you get an iPod.If you want a computer that will last for years and maintain resale value you get a Mac.If you want a home WiFi network that Just Works&tm;, you get the Airport Express Base Station.It's the size of a macbook power brick, and plugs right into electric.  You plug in your broadband device and away you go.  The setup app that is built in to OS X makes configuration simple, and in just a few minutes you're online browsing pictures of unicorns and movies of rainbows.In the past 4 years I've had Netgear, Belkin, D-link ... They all required a hard reset (wherein I disconnected their power, swore a little under my breath, and plugged the thing back in) and are now nicely stacked in my basement where they won't do anyone any harm.  The Airport Express has been reset maybe 3 times since I bought it a couple months ago; once when I configured it on delivery, again when I applied a firmware update (flawless procedure BTW), and finally when we, get this, extended the network to a friend's Airport Extreme for a LAN party!  My previous WiFi devices had all fallen over and died every time I tried to play networked games with a handful of friends, but the Express was chugging along nicely before we wirelessly conected it to the Extreme, and the two worked together in tandem flawlessly.The only crime is that the thing is sitting in a corner of the house where it isn't visible.The Airport Express was the best value for my WiFi dollar since I first started using WiFi.It's good stuff.

$review_text.: What a wonderful alternative to taking underwater pictures. No need to spend a couple hundred dollars on a underwater housing case or a few hundred for an camera specifically made for underwater.  Also don't settle the the cheap one time use under water cameras.  These cases allow you to take beautiful clear pictures using your own digital camera.  I needed a waterproof case for myCanon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Blue)and since I already owned a Dicapac for a another brand of camera I knew there would be no other choice for me than the DicaPac brand.  This is a terrific way to protect your camera from water, sand and even snow. The optical lens sometimes interfere with the camera's zooms lens, just make sure to hold the lens from the camera's view. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Here is something I found that was helpful since the description does not list the camera's that are compatible:DicaPac WP410 Case will fit the following brands:Canon Powershot:SD10/20/30/40/100/110/200/300/400/430/450/600/630/750/700IS/790IS/800IS/870IS/1000/1100/S200/230/300/400Sony Cybershot DSC:S40/500/600/650/700/750/780/W30/35/40/50/55/70/80/90/150/170/200/300Kodak EasyShare:C533/643/653/743/763/LS743M753/763/853/873/883/893IS/1033I have listed only a few of the camera brands this is compatible with.  If you want to see if your camera is compatible, visit the company's website which I found very helpful.  Amazon's price can not be beat.

$review_text.: I've owned this about a month and is seems to work fine with light use.Pros- Small


39mm x 12.2mm x 4.5mm There are some flash drives that are a bit thinner at about 2.5mm, but you loose the advantage of having protected contacts.- Tough all metal case
 It could survive a lot more abuse than competing flash drives that are plastic


I have no concerns with leaving it on a keychain that gets tossed around.- large strong metal loop for keychain or lanyard, inner diameter 8.4mm- Decent speed, but not blazing fast: Large file writes 8MB/s, reads 17MB/s- Cost was very competitive compared to all other 16GB drives, and less than others in this small size class.- 5 year warrantyCons- open end is susceptible to dust or lint accumulation, it may need to be blown out periodically with compressed air
This is the tradeoff versus having a cap that may get lost.- Does not fit into some machines


The mechanical tolerances are such that it will not plug into some machines without using so much force that you risk damaging the port on the computer


I've never experienced this problem with any other USB drive I've owned, and I have at least 10 different models including others from Kingston


 There isn't any excuse for this and it's the reason I took off two stars - I can't use it in all "Universal" Serial Bus ports
Possibly with more insertion/removal cycles it will loosen up, but it should work fine right out of the box.Bottom Line - if it fits the computers you need to use it with and high speed isn't a concern, it's a great little flash drive at a good price


But, if you need a drive that must work in any random computer you encounter such as at the library, this may not be the best choice.

$REVIEW.: I have owned this lens for only 3 days yet... and this is my second DSLR lens to the Canon 28-105mm USM one.Regardless, I can already see the difference in image quality when I compare the two. This lens is far better in sharpness and color rendition at an equivalent focal length. It is amazingly sharp around 2.8f.I wish I had bought this one in the first place... and then I wont have bought the 28-105 one so soon.To sum up:Pros:- A great lens for starters.- Very sharp around f2.8, sharp even otherwise.- Very good for low light conditions.- Light weight, not bulky in size.- Vibrant colors.Cons:- Auto focus isnt very handy.. and struggles sometimes in low light conditions. But thats expected I think.- Focussing is noisy.. no ultrasonic gizmos in there.- Manual focus wil need some skills... the grip threads arent very easily grip-pable.In the end, I would actually cross off all the cons from the list considering the price you pay for it: a sub-100 bucks lens that gives excellent image quality. People who complain about the build quality probably care more about a solid body than about the end result: image quality.. and will be happy to pay 10 times for a lens that isnt as sharp... so let them pay the extra bucks if they can. I speak from personal experience since I paid about 4 times as much for a USM lens and this one still beats the expensive one by a long margin!!Recommendation: I highly recommend this lens as a starter lens. I would in fact advise you to get this one instead of the crappy kit lenses that no one would buy otherwise.

$REVIEW.: This little machine is WONDERFUL.  I have used it DAILY since I got it a month ago. It is so practical and functional. It is so much MORE then just a CD or MP3 Player. I am so GLAD I decided to purchase it.The sound quality is EXCELLENT at SP and LP2 (up to 160 minutes on one $2 Mini Disc). As Good (or BETTER):)  then the original CD.  The sound quality at LP4 (up to 5 hours and 20 minutes on ONE $2 Mini Disc) isn't the greatest (it's similar to MP3 at that setting) but this high compression is great for taping long broadcasts (like football/basketball/baseball from the radio).I use it with a microphone (you'll have to purchase this separately) to record classes/meetings and LIVE Music/Singing. The sound quality is UNBELIEVABLE, almost like you're there!MiniDiscs allow you to put track marks while you're recording so you can easily find your place later. You can even LABEL these tracks are you're recording to make it even easier to find your spot.The USB transfer from Computer to Mini Disc is fast and flawless using Sony's Simple Burn Software. (Be sure to download the latest "patch upgrade" to the software from Sony's website).  I can usually transfer an entire CD at LP2 compression in under 5 minutes.To transfer MP3 and other types of files on your computer to this unit, I don't recommend using the OpenMG that Sony provides because of the limitations it imposes (checking out limits). Use Nero ImageDrive (from Nero Burning ROM 5.5) or some other application that can "burn" an Audio CD image to your hard drive or make an AUDIO CD from these files and then transfer using the Simple Burn Application.If you don't want any compression for your recordings (Sony's Simple Burner transfers at LP2 or LP4 only) and want an extremely high quality transfer, you can use the included optical cable to connect from the optical out of your CD player to this mini disc unit and record in real time. Note that Sony's Playstation 2 has an optical out and will play DVDs and CDs as well as Playstaion games.To transfer from MiniDisc to Computer you'll need to connect a stereo mini jack (on both ends) patch cable from the headphone out of the mini disc to the "line in" of your computer and record the sound in "real time" using a sound program (usually bundled with your CD burning software).  This method is a little tedious, but it works fine.For more tips/hints see [...] they have a wealth of information on mini discs.This package is worth the extra money over the MZ-N505 because it includes the following (not included with the 505 model):Microphone Input (to record)Remote control (connected to heaphone jack)Car Kit (Includes Cassette Adapter/9V battery adapter)Little Leather PouchStandard AA sized Rechargable Battery (Though it's a Nickel Cadium!  Don't know why Sony didn't provide a NiMH Rechargable.. but you can alway purchase one on your own)TOS Link Optical CableLarger LCD Display (to see more of everything)It's a GREAT Package and a GREAT Electronic Device.MUCH Better then Sliced Bread!  :)

I want a camera with long zoom, but I still want to use the auto settings
My main complaint is this camera always chose higher iso resulting in noisy/grainy pictures


Indoors (with window shades open & sunlight coming in) the pictures were very noisy, not even acceptable

Outdoors the pictures were much better with little noise but still choosing a higher iso resulting in slightly more noise than my Samsung Galaxy Note II

$review_text.: I am a bit of an audiophile, however I'm by no means a perfectionist in terms of superhuman hearing. The Anker Cube Bluetooth Speaker is a wonderful, dynamic sounding, little speaker that delivers a surprising punch. The speaker itself measures just 3x3x3&#34; so it's not a spacehog by any means, leaving plenty of room on your counter, desk, dresser, etc. The Anker Cube has a non-slip silicone rubber footing on the bottom to help keep it from sliding around, though it does collect hair, dust, grass or whatever is under it when you set it down. Not an issue, just brush off the foreign matter when you pick it back up.Pairing the device is a simple and necessary step. However my iPhone easily recognized the new device and it was simply a matter of selecting the speaker to get it to pair. The device shows up as &#34;Anker MP141&#34; which is easily identifiable amongst the myriad of Bluetooth devices I have paired to my iPhone already. Pairing it with my iPad was just as simple, and the same can be said for my wife's Venue 8 tablet, our Samsung tablet, Toshiba tablet, and my wife's Samsung Galaxy SIII phone. Essentially if your chosen device is Bluetooth capable, this little speaker will pair easily with it and deliver an unexpected punch to the gut in terms of sound quality.The Anker Cube, for what it is, is the best deal in portable Bluetooth speakers around. I've tested and reviewed many of these before this one, and even purchased a few others to give as gifts (but not before testing them!). While this speaker delivers a rich sound it's not a 500 watt system and you shouldn't expect tinnitus-inducing volume from this speaker, nor bowel rattling bass. However, the Anker Cube delivers a very crisp high range and a smooth, deep bass rich enough to please most discerning music lovers. Testing this device with Netflix on my iPad was great, too. Sometimes the Bluetooth on these little speakers is off just by a split second when you watch a video making the person speaking look like they're out of sync with what's being said. Not so with the Anker Cube. To that end the Anker Cube has an impressive 30+ feet line-of-sight transmission. To actually break the transmission I had to walk around a corner and slide my iPhone into my pocket and place my hands on top of it to disrupt the Bluetooth signal enough to get it to cut out. Doing this only caused a brief drop in the signal, it never went totally out until I went into another room and closed the door. There was no line-of-sight to the speaker at this point and the signal finally dropped out completely. That IS impressive. I have a Jawbone speaker which doesn't have as reliable a Bluetooth signal as this. No kidding.Using the speaker is fairly simple, just slide the power switch into the &#34;On&#34; position and play your music, or watch something, or whatever it is you want to use it for. The Anker Cube has 3 buttons on the side &#8220;+&#8221;( Volume up), &#8220;&#62;&#8221; (Play, Pause), and &#8220;-&#8220; (Volume down).The Anker Cube comes with an auxiliary cable and a MICRO -USB cable. Charging the speaker requires you to either plug the USB cable into your computer, or a wall jack that produces 5W maximum output.Here's a brief list of some great features on the Anker Cube:* Small and compact* Great sound when paired with any device* Micro USB charging from a computer, or wall jack* Pairing the device is quick and easy* Battery life rated at 20 hours (I have not played it until it fully discharges yet, up to 11 hours so far!)* 3.5mm line-in jack for devices which aren't Bluetooth capable (you can plug it into an old CD Walkman, or something!)Things which could be improved:* Bass, while rich, isn't as fully developed as it could be. However for the price of the Anker Cube, this is easily forgiven. The overall sound is still fantastic and when compared to my Jawbone it holds its own. The Anker Cube is a total keeper.* The power switch. It should be changed to a button, the sliding switch is dated and looks a bit cheesy on an otherwise gorgeous device.Overall impression:1) Function: 5 stars2) Design: 4.5 stars (Power Switch should be a button rather than a slide-type switch)3) Ease of Use/Installation: 5 stars4) Durability: 5 stars5) Price: 5 stars5 out of 5 for this little Anker Cube Ultra-Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker. While the design flaw of the power switch is an annoyance and I rated it 4.5 stars in that category, the rest of the device makes up for this failing which easily pushes the overall rating to 5 stars. That&#8217;s the only issue I have with this speaker and it&#8217;s something I can easily overlook. It&#8217;s beautifully crafted, feels weighty and durable and sounds superb!I was provided a free sample from the good folks at Anker for a fair, honest and unbiased review.

$REVIEW.: I have purchased Jabra products in the past, such as a car plug for my phone and have been satisfied


 Although I don't use blue tooth for my iPhone, this wireless speaker is advertised as being able to pair up with other means such as USB cable
 I needed a speaker for my iPod so that I could listen to music at work (the iPods do not have speakers)

 The only way I could listen to music at work was through my iPhone but I have much more music on my iPod so I decided to buy this speaker since it was Jabra (good brand) and looked tiny.I have to admit that I love how small this speaker is (won't take up much room in my office) and the texture of it (sort of rubbery not slippery) and the weight of it (heavy as to be substantial but not too heavy that I would get a cramp carrying it around)


 The wire that connects the speaker to the iPod is a cute pink color and has a slot to put it in on the bottom of the speaker when you are done listening to music
 At first I was surprised because I plugged it in and pressed the volume button but no music came out


 Duh, I forgot to turn the speaker on


 The buttons are tiny so it is easy to miss
 Wow, what a powerful punch this little speaker packs
 No static, just clear music


 It was nice that the speaker was charged and ready to go when I first received it

 The packaging is quite difficult and I was wondering how I was going to charge the speaker until I found the USB cable packed at the bottom of the box.I would recommend this product, however I have a warning


 After you finish using the speaker, make sure to turn it off


 The first day I used this product at home, I forgot to turn it off


 Imagine how panicked I was when in the middle of the night I was woken up with a loud message from this speaker that it needs to be recharged


 I couldn't figure out where the noise and message was coming from and then remembered the speaker and saw the bluetooth light flashing and then I exhaled a sigh of relief and turned it off.

$REVIEW.: I ordered this cable because it was recommended when looking for options to stream videos from my Kindle Fire to my TV.  Didn't realize I  wouldn't be able to do so until after I received it.  Apparently only the new Kindle Fires have that capability and not the original.  So there was nothing wrong with the cable, only there was misleading information when researching what would be needed to connect the Fire to a TV.  So if you have the original Fire, just keep watching videos on the Kindle and don't bother trying to watch it on you much bigger TV screen.

$review_text.: *Update* After posting this review, I experienced probably the best customer service I've ever had

I received the replacement brand new pair of earphones with the only charge being 2 dollars to ship the broken pair out

The service was speedy and they were very understanding of the problem

I also noticed that the new earphones have been updated with casing where the wire splits, so the product seems to be sturdier.I've had these earphones only for a few months, when they started to die
The connection of the wire to the jack seems to be the weakest part of the product


The other day I went to use them and found one ear to be silent unless I bent the wire perfectly
Soon after they stopped working completely
Other than that, the sound quality was good, but nothing amazing, these aren't quite audiophile quality
The mid-ranges are excellent, but the bass is pretty weak, so if you're looking for heavy bass check out some of Think Sound's other earphone models.The wood style earphones do look very cool, but in the end that doesn't mean too much for an in-the-ear earphone, as they will usually be in my ears
:) Also, I don't know if they actually add anything to the sound

So overall, these are fancy/cool headphones with the added benefit of excellent customer service if there are any problems with the product.

$review_text.: I'm a huge fan of Belkin products. For my last generation Kindle fire, I got theBelkin QODE Bluetooth Keyboard Folio Case for Kindle Fire HD 7" (Previous Generation)which is the best thing ever. Belkin doesn't have a keyboard case on the market yet for the new HDX 7", but I'm sure they will soon. If they do, that would be the way to go.In the meantime, this little case is awesome. It's a lightweight design which makes it super easy for portability. It's easy on the eyes and to the touch. The outside is an attractive grey that is smooth and not bulky, and the interior is a wonderful velvet. My favorite part is the grooves that they built into the interior for standing it. There are several different levels of grooves for different angles of kindle viewing. You wouldn't even notice them at first, they are built so seamlessly into the design. The kindle stays in place without any problems even though these grooves are so subtle. I just love how graceful this whole design is.I will continue to purchase Belkin products as they are always my favorite. You can pair it withAmazonBasics Bluetooth Keyboard for Android Devices (fits All Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Fire HDX models), Blackand you'll have a great Kindle experience.

These speakers came with my Dell PC and have lasted about 8 years or so, long after I got rid of the computer.I have heard many newer speakers that cost over $100 that don't even come close. The sub is the centerpiece and gives tight and punchy bass and gets incredibly loud for only 30 watts. I've blasted these at full volume so I could dye my hair in the bathroom down the hall or clean the house and still enjoy music.If you can find these for under $80, get them!

$REVIEW.: I bought 4 of these drawers and immediately removed the so-called 'locks' because (1) they're useless, and (2), the way the interior of the drawer is designed, the first time a stack of jewel cases falls forward when closing the drawer, the 'lock' will most likely chip off the top right corner of the front-most jewel case and you'll be looking for a replacement jewel case and I don't need the aggravation.Then there's the issue of the anticipated orientation of the jewel cases in the drawer - SIDEWAYS - it's your only choice.  It also makes the spine label impossible to see from the top.  Bad design.Then there's the issue of the interior width of the drawer.  If they'd made it a millimeter wider, it would be easier to insert and remove a small stack of three or four jewel cases in one motion.  As it is, you really need to insert them one at a time.I guess I've been spoiled by the Fellowes brand of CD-Drawers which I've had for over a decade and which have none of these issues even though they have a plastic 'lock' (never used but also never in the way).

$review_text.: Colors were nice and neutral (compared to the $29 Funai unit from Walmart which has an orange push), and the background was pretty.  Seems like a decent little player, and I like the fact that it had a display, which is rare in this price range.However, my purpose was dubbing DVDs that my videographers turn in to my video department -- essentially home-made videos, as they were recorded on portable DVD recorders such as the Sony VRD-MC6 from miniDV cameras, etc.  This player somehow produced a video signal that my Panasonic DMR series recorders mistook as Macrovision, and it blocked me from dubbing from this deck.  I had to return it as unusable.I kept the $29 Funai unit, and also added a Sony SR210P.  Neither of these units show the problem of creating Macrovision where none should exist.  Also the Sony has nice neutral colors like the Samsung did.

$review_text.: I bought this to pair with a set of wireless headphones (with built in microphone) [motorola s305 bluetooth stereo headset].  I use to be an early adopter and thought it was fun to mess around with gadgets / computers - but now my life is busy enough I just want something that works out of the box.  I installed the software / plugged it into my computer as directed (windows vista) - and then tried to pair with my headphones (which by the way paired no problems / easily with my iphone).The computer was able to pair with the listening side of the headphones, but not with the microphone side (so I could listen, but not talk).  I spent about 15 minutes fooling around with it - couldn't get it to work - and have since just ignored it.  I suppose I will get back to fixing it at some point (since I bought it), but no time right now.  It might not be the product's fault (could be windows, headphones, or me following directions poorly) - but for just sharing my experience (for what it is worth).  Also - this thing is tiny - which may be great for a laptop (my laptop already has built in bluetooth) - but my desktop is under my desk - and it is a pain to get this thing back out of the usb slot when you want to remove it.  You have to get a good grip on it which is hard to do when you're reaching under the desk.

$review_text.: I purchased both theTamrac 3445 Rally 5 Camera/Netbook/iPad Bag (Brown/Tan)andTamrac 3447 Rally 7 Camera/Laptop Bag (Brown/Tan)bags as I was looking for a daily use camera bag


 I had a few key criteria for what the bag had to hold:1


Be able to hold my camera (Canon EOS 50D)2


1 flash (Canon Speedlite 580EXorCanon Speedlite 430EX II)3

1 lens on Camera and at least 1 additional lens4.Apple iPadin this case:Twelve South BookBook for iPad in Classic Black Style5

Assorted: memory cards, ipad camera kit, charger (iPad and camera), spare battery, etc.6


Place to keep a water bottle or 2The Rally 7 bag has 4 vertical compartments, whereas the Rally 5 has 3 vertical compartments


 Both bags have a compartment for keeping a laptop, netbook or tablet


 In addition there are 2 mesh pockets on either side, a zippered compartment at the front of the bag (under the flap) and a document pocket in the back of the bag.The Rally 7 held everything great, I could hold All of the above comfortably
 I could fit myCanon EF 100-400mm f4.5-5.6Llens and 2-3 other lenses, depending on which ones I used

 The problem was exactly what I could fit in the bag

 Since this is going to be my walking around bag (and what I carry to work every day) I needed to keep myself from over filling the bag
 The space for the iPad was plenty large and could easily hold a laptop instead (up to 15")
 The pockets on the sides of the bag are pretty nice for keeping small items or water bottles and the front pocket under the flap holds all the assorted accessories I need.The Rally 5 on the other hand basically has one less slot so I can hold everything that I listed above, but the 100-400L lens

The iPad slot fits my iPad in case just barely or could fit a netbook instead (up to maybe a 11" or 12" screen, my 13" MacBook does not fit)

The bag is a little shorter and not quite as wide as the Rally 7, but the depth of the bags is just about the same as can be seen in the photos i have added to the bag pages or in the specs provided by Tamrac

The best part is that the bag now goes with me wherever I go, so I take more photos
I have to plan things more carefully than I did with my backpack, but at the same time this makes the bag lighter.I ended up returning the Rally 7 and kept the Rally 5

 I'm not sure either of these bags could hold a Pro body or a body with a grip, but since that isn't what I have it wasn't a concern


Here are a few things that I would like done differently on the bag:1


Add the quiet opening velcro flaps like on the Crumpler bags (that I also looked at, but were too heavy).2
Allow the strap to be changed, although the strap is reasonably comfortable, I can see wanting a different strap or one with more padding.3


I'm not sure I like the clip in the front for closing the flap, it doesn't have the guides on the side which means I don't quite get it lined up all the time.Other than those 3 items I really like my new bag! I've been using it for almost 6 weeks now and have found it to be exactly what I needed and when my camera isn't it, I can even use it to hold the 100-400 lens to shoot with at an event so I can get at it and swap lenses
I like the brown color as well (though I did like the black bag with red stripe that was available for other versions of this bag, that didn't have the laptop/iPad slot).Note: I've posted this review on both the Rally 5 and Rally 7 pages as I hope this helps anyone trying to decide between these bags.

I had previously bought a cable which was a nice idea because it was full length 4', not just an adaptor, from a Hong Kong seller on ebax.

In the end I figured- hey it's a Sony, I've always had good experiences with Sony products so I went ahead and got it (oh yeah on amazon deals app for $174.00). Well it came on time as expected, Very pleased with the ease to set up the system. My TV is ARC compatible (LG 47LM7600-UA) new model 3D smart TV. The speakers on my TV were already decent- not surround sound quality, but the get loud as hell. This new system sounds great. I've tested it with music, movies and games over the past 2 weeks and have had no problems so far. When I turn on my TV it turns on and turns off when I power down. Incredibly user friendly and great technology. Like I said already- Sony products have never let me down.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this after having a used a Kodak DX6440 for the past 3 years.  After getting the M753 I was hoping this would be a good replacement but now it's going back.  I like that the camera battery can be charged with the USB cable (I wish all cameras could do this) in addition to the Kodak docking station.  Also, if you have a power cord from a non-compatible docking station you can still plug it into the camera to charge it (the DX6440 docking station does not work with M753).  I really the fact that kodak cameras can charge the battery because I never liked doing the AA rechargeable battery-shuffle.  Why can't the camera charge them???I tested the camera and a lot of the pictures had noise in them and were grainy even in low light.  My old DX6440 was better and pictures seemed clearer.  Also, even though the M753 is very light and small, it feels and look cheaply made.  It seems like it wouldn't take much to break this.  I wouldn't mind some additional weight to the camera if it made it more solid and rigid.Here's the rundown:Pros:Small and light (mostly because battery is a small re-chargeable, not heavier AA style)USB, docking station, or power cord can charge the battery.Has a big 2.5 LCD and more features then cameras made a few years ago.Cons:Pictures seemed grainy in low light - even with the flash and in high ISO modeCamera doesn't use AA (not a problem for me, but maybe for others)Feels flimsy and cheaply madeFinally, one shouldn't get hung up on megapixels when shopping for a camera.  Look at getting a camera with a high quality lens that can take crisp clear pictures (the DX6440 has a better 4X optical lens).  A 4-6 megapixel with a good lens vs an 7-8 megapixel with a poor lens isn't worth the extra money.  You can save a few bucks because the market price of most consumer cameras are driven by megapixels.

$review_text.: This was so easy to set up, I couldn't believe it at first.  You just push the greet button and set up your Bluetooth on your cell phone, enter 0000 for the password and you are done. Everytime I come home, this item and my cell phone pair up and work without any prodding. Sometimes, my cell phone asks me to enter the password again, but no big deal. The range is not too good.  I generally put my cell phone in immediate proximity to the gateway to make sure the reception is good. I think the main problem is walls block the signal. One of the neat things is that caller ID from my cell phone shows up on my home phones. I have not set up my home phones with speed dial yet, but I think that will work fine. This device has exceeded my expectations and then some.  I am very happy with its performance.
$review_summary.: Just Fantastic!  Works Beautifully


 Beyond Expectations.

$review_text.: I would have to agree with the previous user who said that the instruction manual was difficult to understand
Yet, I enjoy setting up components and speakers while trying to find certain acoustic angles throughout the room

In other words...the instruction manual really didn't bother me
Anyhow, the DE698 replaced an older Sony model (6 yrs

old) that had only Dolby Pro Logic (2.1 channel)

I was impressed with the first model due to the fact that it never caused me any trouble


It was simply a respectable and reliable amplifier that I could depend on
Consider some of the following attributes of the DE698,Cons:1) There is no "optical in" for the DVD player

Only inputs for Video 1, SACD/CD, and MD/Tape


Not that big of a deal since you can connect the DVD into the Video 1 optical input, yet a hassle when using the provided universal remote (pressing between DVD and Video 1 to change the scene or turn up the volume).2) Through the DE698 is respectable, it isn't the best in comparison to the Denon's and Onkyo's out there
The reproduction of music and movies is considered by some to be average to above average


For myself, I can barely hear the difference between my friends ridiculously expensive Denon and the 698
Even though the Denon was three hundred dollars more, the Sony seems to reproduce the same quality

This is possibly due to the following issues:- The Denon was connected with 16 gauge Monster Wire (the lower  the gauge = usually the better transfer of sound)
Sony was connected  with 14 gauge Audio Quest.- The Denon was connected with RCA analogue - bought from  Walmart -  between the CD/DVD and receiver


Sony was connected  with Monster digital optical input/output between the CD/DVD.3)The DE698 is provided with a "Universal Remote." I'm pretty sure Sony doesn't understand the definition of "universal." To what extent you may ask? Well...I'm still using three remotes! And yes, I did read the manual for this task while setting up the rest of the system.Pro's:1) Fits nicely with other Sony Components

Light blue ambiance turns on the face plate of the receiver when Dolby Digital is available
Three optical outputs

Stable speaker connectors (they twist).2) The DE698 lets the listener tweak the sound within certain sound fields

The "Custom" mode is rather user friendly...and kinda fun (but i'm a guy).I guess my point is that a lot of people skip out on the wiring of their components which makes a $500 amp sound like a $200 amp, or perhaps the other way around
If you want a decent, respectable, and reliable receiver the DE698 is for you (at least it was for me).

$REVIEW.: I set this up in 20 minutes and have been so pleased ever since

I love the Guest option so I don't have to share my secure wifi service with friends who visit or renters

The coverage for this Netgear far out reaches the old Linksys router that was fadding fast at the end

I'll be anxious to try it out in my backyard next summer

Great delivery from Amazon as usual.


$SUMMARY.: Wow Wifi!

$REVIEW.: Italy is a really complicated place to go for power connectors. It has three kinds of connector you will encounter, a European, schuko, and the three pin Italian plug. This connector can fits most sockets and has an extra pair of holes on the bottom so I can plug two items into the plug. This adapter was a great buy.
$SUMMARY.: Great Product and reliable

$review_text.: The Verbatim MediaShare 1 TB came well packaged with software, network cable and power adapter. It also came with a CD that was ostensibly "user documentation" but is actually, in fact, almost entirely useless.Once the MediaShare is configured using the installation software, it may be accessed in a variety of ways: (1) as a networked drive in Windows; (2) through the MediaShare program installed; or (3) remotely by navigating to the myverbatim website. If used as a networked drive in Windows, your best bet is to use Windows 7 as you will only be prompted once to enter the user name and password. With Windows XP or Vista, the user is continually prompted for the password. This occurs even if the MediaShare program is installed on the computer and reports that it is "logged in" to the MediaShare.The chasis is a nice metallic finish and appears quite secure. There is not much by way of controls on the front panel of the MediaShare.All in all, a solid product with the added bonus of remote access.
$SUMMARY.: Decent Network Storage Solution - User Documentation Lacking

$review_text.: Once  I almost bought a $75 cable of this length, it was in the beginning of HDMI days,I hesitated and went home, ordered this cable, and since then i've been very happy with it.Im not too technical about things, Ive sone some research online about the price and quality of the cables. I found many websited especially of these very expensive brands telling you about gold connectors and requency and gigabits and megabytes and what not.In the end, at home I dont have like in a tv-show room, 20 tv's next to eachother to compare colors, and sound or milliseconds etc.what i can tell you is, this cable works without a glitch on my 56" sony LCD, connected to my TV box from, i unplugged it and replugged it in my PS3, I tried for you on a Macbook Air, and also an Apple TV.It seems to work great on all of them ! so beat it

$review_text.: This was the most frustrating item I have ever owned.  I could set it up where the Dish Pointer Pro app on my smartphone would show a clear line of sight to the 110 and 119 satellites and slightly questionable to 129 and when I would let it go through the alignment routine it would normally only lock onto one.  The few times it would lock onto 110 and 119 it would only last about 5 minutes before it came back and said I had no connectivity.  There were also times where I would be locked onto the 110 satellite watching tv all evening only to wake up in the morning, turn on the tv and have a screen say no connectivity and would have to let it perform its alignment routine for another 20 minutes!  I went back old school and set up an HD dish, immediately locked everything in and I'm now re-growing the hair I had pulled out.  Other notes; Tailgater will only work with a max of about 150' feet of cable, would not work at all with the cable in my Montana 5th wheel ( I had to run it into the window - I believe the problem was the signal/power traveling from the receiver to the dish).  Cost me $60 to send it back.

$review_text.: I picked this "Netgear PTV3000-100NAS Push2TV" for one simple reason--to watch Hulu on my TV. I ditched cable a few years ago and almost exclusively watch TV shows on Hulu nowadays, connecting my laptop with and HDMI cable.  I hope with this device I could skip the step of having to pull out the cable and connect my laptop every time I wanted to watch a show.And it works! Once I got everything set up (which took awhile) I was able to show my screen on my TV. The picture isn't great, but then it was never great to begin with even over my HDMI cable.  And there are all the usual issues of watching TV over WiFi--occasional loss of signal, interference, etc ... but those are just part of the deal of my internet connection and I've learned to live with it.The only trouble I had with "Push2TV" was that the set up isn't as easy as I would like.  I'm not super tech savvy, and if there is one thing I love in a device it is plug-and-play. "Push2TV" is not plug-and-play, and requires installing some additional software and calibrating of the device. It's not a HUGE headache though, and once things are up and running you are golden.
$SUMMARY.: WiFi TV
