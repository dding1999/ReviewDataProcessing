$review_text.: Kurosawa's colorful, Japanese version of Shakespeare's 'MacBeth'.  Washizu [Mifune] is appropriately outraged, terrified, guilt-ridden and evil, as befits a man who has slaughtered his Lord and seized his lands, army and castle. He, and his guilty demons, are the stars of the movie set against the foggy, mystical background of a medieval fortress and surrounding forest.Washizu should recognize what he's in for but he chooses to believe a mocking ghost who foretells that he cannot be defeated unless the very forest attacks his castle.  Well we all know the rest of the story.The Japanese pageantry with its feudal customs is worth watching all by itself.  The climactic scene in which Washizu's warriors turn against him is magnificent action and cinema.  I'm wondering how they did it without seriously injuring Mifune?  I enjoyed the film but, to be certain, 'MacBeth' is my favorite of all Shakespeare's plays and I think Kurosawa did it justice with a very Japanese flare.

$review_text.: Judd Nelson does a good job in both of these movies playing a demented killer named Stanley. The original movie is fairly sinister as we first meet the troubled writer as he is on a killing spree. The sequel is rather funny and more ridiculous, as Stanley puts on cheesy disguises to gain entry to the filming of the movie of his earlier killing rampage(from the first movie).I have both of these movies in my collection and find both of them entertaining. If you can get them at a decent price, I think they are movies you would want to watch a few times. The scenarios that occur in each of the movies are rather fun to watch as they play out.

$review_text.: I remembered seeing Cinderfella a long time ago and thinking it was so funny, so when I came across this film, I was excited about seeing it.  Well, let's just say I could not finish this one.  It just wasn't funny.  Jerry Lewis was just loud and silly but that doesn't automatically equal funny in my book.  I am going to rent Cinderfella soon and see if I still think that is funny.  If I don't find it funny, I will amend this review because then I know my sense of humor has changed and I guess this really wouldn't be a fair review. Until then, I can't give it more than a few stars. It wasn't absolutely awful, but just wasn't fun or funny enough to hold my interest.

$REVIEW.: Dragonfly stars Kevin Costner as an Emergency Room doctor who's wife is presumed dead in Venezuela.  I was channel surfing and tuned this in for what would have been a few seconds.  Surprisingly gripped I watched to the end.Directed by Tom Shadyac and written by Brandon Camp and Mike Thompson the film begins with Emily's (Susanna Thompson) bus being lost in a storm and Joe Darrow (Costner) working 'round the clock to avoid mourning his pregnant wife.  The title comes from Emily's fascination with dragonflies and we learn Dr. Darrow is a sceptic when he tells a patient who attempted suicide, "this crappy world is all there is".  Soon he starts getting what he believes are messages from Emily via kids who have near death experiences, and everyone including his friend (Kathy Bates) tells him he's crazy.  When the messages are consistent from different kids as well as a nun who studies near death experience, an adult "brain dead" patient, and even his parrot, he starts to figure out what she's trying to say from beyond the grave.Most of the film is consistent, except for one scene that is a bit distracting for its lack of believability, namely when he jumps into the lake, ends up underwater, is rescued, and then is perfectly fine the next minute.  The scene is too over-the-top and really should have been cut, especially in a film where there is some good subtlety otherwise.  The ending is a great fairytale type ending, but also suffers from being too over-the-top to be believable.However this film is well worth watching as an interesting take on the near death experience and a good vehicle for Kevin Costner.  Easily superior to the ridiculous film Sixth Sense, and even better than Ghost, as this one has subtlety.  I believe the NDE and afterlife are worth exploring in a deep serious manner, and this film at least has a hint of that.  I believe consciousness is basically eternal.

Fox) who reports his squad for the rape and murder of a Vietnamese woman during Vietnam. He lives in fear and is assumed the enemy for not participating in the heinous acts. The squad leader (Sean Penn) has no moral conscious and his ego gets the best of him. Ving Rhames gave a speech about justice and was extremely right on.

$REVIEW.: Over his long career, John Carpenter made a few classic movies and a pretty fair amount of junk. Classics include HALLOWEEN, THE THING and to some, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and most questionably BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA. Junk includes THE FOG, CHRISTINE, THEY LIVE, GHOSTS OF MARS, etc. (ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is its own peculiar little gem...not sure I can label it a classic.) The other day, I decided to take a LONG overdue 2nd (or perhaps 3rd) look at the John Carpenter film that originally gave me the biggest chills of all. I knew even in 1987 that it wasn't a great movie...but there was something about it that just gave me the willies. So when I watched in 2009, it was a giant cheese-fest of `80s clothing and hairstyles, with a typically grating John Carpenter score and barely passable performances. BUT it also managed to give me the creeps.In a rundown catholic church in the middle of skid row, a small, secret group of priests and nuns have kept hidden and secret an odd glass vessel that contains a swirly, glowing green viscous liquid. This liquid has special properties, and a renowned priest (Donald Pleasance) is convinced that the container is barely holding in an evil presence capable of ruling the world.He goes for help to a scientist, philosopher and former debate opponent (Victor Wong)...hoping that a scientific explanation might assist, as the religious implications are too great to bear. Wong assembles a group of grad students to help, and they bring all their equipment and all their skepticism to the church one evening...determined to figure out what they're dealing with.I'll cut to the chase...the liquid appears to be Satan, trapped but very close to escaping. His goal is to provide a doorway for his father, the "Anti-God" to come into our world. You can imagine that the consequences of this would be dire.What I LIKE about the film is the combining of science and faith. The faithful are suitably freaked out...but gradually, each and every scientist is just as scared. Before long, everyone trapped in the church has become a horrified believer. The scientists figure out the "scientific" basis for what Satan and his dad are brewing up...but it's not less terrifying for having a scientific basis...it's MORE terrifying.Some of the students begin to experience dreams, in which computerized voices claiming to be from the future, are sending messages back to the present in an effort to encourage a change in what is about to happen. It is these images that gave me the biggest willies back in the `80s, and they still work for me today. For me, Carpenter simply latched on to a way of presenting this idea that got to me in a way I can't explain.PRINCE OF DARKNESS is not only a "Satan returning to earth" film...it is a slasher movie. At first, the killers are the homeless vagrants that are bowing to the will of Satan and refuse to let anyone leave the church. The "leader" of these bums is played by Alice Cooper, of all people. There are plenty of gory deaths, including the first death by impaling on a bicycle that I can remember seeing. While the gore is not up to the standards of today, it is convincing enough to avoid shattering the feeling of creepiness. Bad things happen to most of the characters in the film.I use the word "characters" loosely. It's mostly a group of young adults from various demographic groups, playing completely predictable parts. It's a sort of a kick to see Jamieson Parker just months before he became a star of SIMON & SIMON (remember THAT dreadful TV show?). He has a porn star mustache and the clothes and hair that no doubt made him a "hunk" in his day, but make him look like a goofball today. Victor Wong looks great in his part as the scientist, and he invests his role with conviction...but isn't entirely convincing. Donald Pleasance, a Carpenter favorite, seems a little lost here, as though he was never able to make much sense of what he was supposed to do as an actor. Although he had another 7 to 8 years of acting ahead of him...he's clearly in the twilight of his career and it's a little bit sad to see.PRINCE OF DARKNESS is hardly a great film, at least when I look at it as objectively as I can. Cardboard characters, gore, and a silly story about an anti-God. Alice Cooper as a zombie-like homeless killer! Yet I can't bring myself to toss it on the garbage heap of forgettable junk...there is a talent for understanding what is frightening lurking just below the cheesy surface. If you're willing to spend 90 minutes of your time on a gamble that this film may not work for you as it did for me, I will recommend it. But you've been warned...you'll either laugh and fall asleep OR you'll get a decent case of the willies.

after that season I was a bit let down


It never seems like any of the answers are coming
As a matter of fact, there are just more questions


It is still mindly entertaing, but more annoying than anything
I truely the show will get canceled before anything is solved and I would forever be left to ponder the answers..


I couldnt handle that, haha

So If you have never seen season 2, dont start it
 If you enjoyed season 2 on tv more power too you and buy it

It has those hilarious moments, and even Mr. Chow from The Hangover gives a great cameo. It's a much darker film and not entirely kid-friendly. I'm sure anyone that grew up with the cartoon in the 80's would love it. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a newcomer this time playing Carly, Sam's new love interest. If you don't dwell on it, you probably won't miss Megan Fox.The Autobots have formed an alliance with the U.S. They soon find out why they originally sent Apollo 11 to the moon in 1969, to discover a Cybertronian ship piloted by Sentinel Prime carrying pillars called The Ark. Optimus revives Sentinel and is immediately betrayed by one of his own. Sentinel and Megatron team up and try to bring their planet; Cybertron to earth. It's up to Sam, Carly, Lennox, Epps and the Autobots to defeat the Decepticons once and for all. I highly recommend TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON!!!

$REVIEW.: Maybe I fell victim to the hype, and went into watching this movie with too high of expectations, but this movie was nowhere near as good as I was expecting it to be.  The acting was solid, Jennifer Lawrence did not disappoint, displaying effectively the full spectrum of human emotions.  The supporting cast, Stanley Tucci in particular, was good.But, like most movies that are based on a book series, this movie felt like there was a greatly compressed timeline.  Events transpired too quickly for there to be any real attachment to the characters or the predicaments in which the characters were placed.  Very little backstory was given.  There was no truly effective &#34;villain&#34; that was introduced.  Sutherland's role as the President was the closest that the story came, but so little plot, dialogue, and screen time was allotted to him that he just became a generic &#34;bad guy&#34; without any believable motive behind his actions.Special effects were good, directorial style was also quite good, allowing the viewer to see and feel what the characters would have seen, introducing some &#34;shaky camera&#34; bits, but not going too over-the-top with it, the way some &#34;gritty&#34; action movies are wont to do.  I personally felt that the sound editing was a bit off, as dialogue tended to get lost in the sound effects, sound track, and background noise, and I found that I was continually adjusting my volume up for dialogue and down for action scenes.For anyone who wants to claim that this movie was excessively violent and to &#34;be warned,&#34; then perhaps they should actually understand a bit about what the movie is about before watching it:  24 children left alone in, basically, a Pay-Per-View bloodbath that pits them against each other in a lone-survivor-takes-all event.  24 children, stuck in the woods, until 23 of them are dead, either by violence or by exposure or injury.  It's rated PG-13, and I think that's appropriate.  if you're concerned about the violence and blood, then don't let your 12 year old watch it.  It's that simple.  I watched far worse when I was 8 years old (The Terminator, Alien, Aliens), and I didn't find anything in this film that even approached the levels of violence and horror that Aliens dished out in the 1980s.

$review_text.: I ordered this movie while serving a tour in Afghanistan

 I remember watching the trailer for this movie time and time again, anxious for its release in the U.S

 I had such an interest in this movie my friends quickly became convinced that the movie would be worth their time to watch


 Now I admit that Anime isn't for everyone

 There are several Japanese culture and subculture fillers in all of Anime that for the casual movie or TV show watcher it might be a bit over-whelming

 Summer Wars is filled to the brim with said culture and it is exactly that which makes this movie both unique and extraordinary for all
 This movie fully assumes the audience is Japanese and as such is a wonderful and colorful experience for everyone
 This may seem contradictory to the previous fact but what a great way to see the culture in its purest form

 This isn't some action film that is full of unreal scenarios or Please Teacher setting where the women are objectified, but rather this movie is a full fledged family movie both funny and exciting.The film takes place in a modern day time setting where an MMO (massive multi-player online) system controls everything
 Everyone uses this system and even more so they depend on it


 This seems plausible considering how much we depend on technology today
 Well what would happen if something in that system went wrong?  This movie answers that question with an interesting and entertaining plot.So if an interesting crisis plot, a love story, family oriented, and Japanese Cultured movie sounds like something you might be interest in try this movie on for size

 Forget that it is animated and try to keep an open mind
 You might be surprised how much you like it


 The people I was deployed with loved it
 Try imagining 10 grown men sitting in a small break room, in uniform, covered in Afghanistan dust, and tired from a full days work, watching an Anime.

$review_text.: Not a great horror movie and it really felt like a B rated budget movie as 90% of it takes place in a single house with the lights off. Like others have stated already alot of reactions to the "bump in the night" doesn't make sense as a normal human would flick the light switch on. 2 stars because it was really bad but I've seen worse. If you want to see a great horror movie watch The Shining.

$review_text.: Paramount Home Video has kindly released in a timely manner the second and COMPLETE season of The Wild Wild West.  This 2nd season offering being in color, the transfers are magnificent with clean sound, crisp color, no artifactual trash and single-sided picture discs.  A job well done!As I have just started watching the set, it contains a couple of silly episodes to start off with, but I have finally come to the episode that IMHO ranks as the finest episode in the entire series.  I'm speaking of "The Night of the Man-Eating House".  The title itself reminds me of a cheap '50's scifi movie but it is anything but!  The screenplay is brilliant with a supurb set and splendid choreography.  "TNOTM-EH" is a scintillating story that displays the eclectic distinguishment of this series.  An excellent season set for anyones collection.
$SUMMARY.: TWWW - Season Two - Perhaps the best!

$review_text.: If you enjoy Rodney Dangerfield at the height of his career as well as popular comedians when they were just starting out, then you will very much like this 3 dvd pack.  However, before you buy and sit down to watch with your younger and even senior family members or friends, be prepared for comedy with lots of sexual overtones and risque language.  Much of the early standup comedy of very popular comedians centered around R and X rated material and this dvd pack does not go against this premise.  The standup act of Andrew "Dice" Clay speaks for itself but even the likes of early Jeff Foxworthy, Jerry Seinfeld, and Tim Allen among others were created for the adult audience and you will most likely be embarrassed watching it with anyone in their senior years and it is definatley not appropriate for the younger set.  The 3 dvd set is a progression in the rating system.  In my opinion, dvd #1 was PG to PG-13, dvd #2 was R to NC-17, and dvd #3 was NC-17 to X.  Being middle aged, I found the dvd's very funny and entertaining but not while watching with my elderly mother. I bought this because she loved Rodney Dangerfield but she never saw him and other comedians she regularly sees on network TV such as Roseanne Barr, Tim Allen, etc. in this venue.  All in all, a very good dvd pack but watch it first before viewing with the young or old.

$REVIEW.: Anyone thinking that this was a film about the life of Truman Capote would probably be disappointed - it's actually about the events in Capote's life surrounding his most famous book, "In Cold Blood."  Starting in 1959 when Capote reads about the Clutter murders in the newspaper, he eventually gets close to the Kansas community that the murder takes place in - despite his conspicuous and gawky other-worldliness - and spends seven years writing the book, in the meantime getting to know the murderers, and maybe even falling into a love/hate relationship with one of them
 For anyone who's ever read the book it should be obvious which of the two murderers he tried harder to understand, and this is the central relationship in a book about a man who has difficulty being truly sincere

 Perhaps one of the most interesting parts of the movie are about Capote's manipulativeness and how people still sort of love him for it


 The relationship with childhood friend Harper Lee is also interesting; Lee famously only wrote one book, and after In Cold Blood Capote stopped publishing as well.

$review_text.: I love Stan Lee. I love Spider-Man to death. I love Marvel Comics. But, I do not like this movie nor most of the movies that Marvel Studios puts out. While the problems are many, this one seems to sum up most of them. First, they favor style over substance. One of the cooler things about Marvel Comics (and many comics in general) is that they are clearly not puerile. Even noted researcher Steve Krashen has spoken favorably of the power of comic books to unlock reluctant readers and he quotes some writing from a Fantastic Four comic from back in the day to support his claims of high levels of vocabulary, plot, character development, and so on. So why these cheesy movies? Going back to Ghost Rider and Spider-Man 3 before this, you have three bad movies in a row. Given the state of the art currently available, the visual concerns are addressed so that it is believable when super heroes do super things. Unlike super heroes movies of the past which featured horrible special effects, today's movies clearly have solved that issue. So the problem for all three then is the writing.This movie is full of some ugly dialogue clunkers, some comedy pratfalls that would make the current producers of the new Scooby Doo cartoons (or anything with Jim Belushi) blush, and really dull action sequences. The actors themselves do little more than cliched actions, most offensively Michael Chiklis and the cardboard Barbie doll Jessica Alba, and even a really cool character like The Silver Surfer seems wasted. Why not bring Spider-Man into the mix since they both had comic book episodes together and the tension between the rivals Spider-Man and The Human Torch would make for some good potential. Alas, I fear it would be wasted with corny lines, empty flash, and the supremely embarrassing joke-within-a-joke product endorsement so prevalent in this film. Why not just have the characters do short promos before the film starts? It would be scarcely less subtle.When a great bad guy like Doctor Doom is rendered as boring and non-threatening as a two-bit street thug, you know you've missed the target by a long shot. Until Marvel can really put together something worthy of the comics from which these movies spawn, I fear more of the same. I wish Stan Lee et al would put as much time into developing the movies of his beloved characters as he did into the comics themselves. That would truly be heroic.

$review_text.: Watched Mars Attacks from a scratched-up library DVD
Sadly, the second half was nearly un-viewable since it skipped through nearly the entire movie

Big bummer, man
Some problems with pacing - for the first 30 minutes of so, we observe everyone on earth anticipating that the Martians are friendly, that they won't attack
We know better, of course, which makes that whole section a bit pointless
Even after the first attack there are some laughs that the slaughter was based on some sort of "cultural misunderstanding"


The evil-ness of the Martians is unsubtle and one-dimensional


They are, simply, evil

Independence Day plays this seriously, but I prefer this one


Ha ha..
Martians.Lots of great lines: like the translator that comes up with "For dark is the suede taht mows a harvest." Or the kid when he talks to his grandmother: "I bet people were pretty scared when they invented the train." "I'm not that old." Grandma calls all her grandkids Thomas

First question from a reporter in the press conference: "Do the martians have two sexes like we do?" Boxing match: The Quaker in Jamaica
Danny DeVito's appeal to the pitiless Martian: "I'm a lawyer
When you take over the Earth you're going to need lawyers." "Liberals, intellectuals, peacemongers, idiots!" Each dummy gets the end they deserve, but Jack Black ("I surrender!") and Michael J Fox get it first


Dross from the president: "We will soon come out with a very real outcome." That whole sentence is just so wrong!!

$review_text.: Do you remember Easters of your youth, when you discovered a gigantic, gold-wrapped chocolate rabbit sitting in your basket?  Remember how delicious it looked, and you knew, from the packaging, that it must be tasty and you would be working on it for a good two weeks?  And then remember how, when you bit into the rabbit and found out the stupid thing was hollow, you thought that Someone Up There must be mocking your trivial existence?  Sam Mendes&#65533; (&#65533;American Beauty&#65533;) new film &#65533;Road to Perdition,&#65533; based on the graphic novel of the same name, manages to illicit the same feelings &#65533; and that&#65533;s about the only feeling it creates.Paul Newman is an Irish mob boss in a smaller Illinois town in 1931, part of Al Capone&#65533;s crumbling empire (remember, Kevin Costner put him in jail by now).  Tom Hanks is one of his hit men, whose luckless son (newcomer Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses Hanks killing someone.  When Newman&#65533;s jealous son, played by Daniel Craig, decides to protect his name by killing Hanks&#65533; family, Hanks and his surviving son take off on a road trip (to, you guessed it, Perdition, Illinois), hoping to convince the mob bosses in Chicago and his hometown to let him execute Newman&#65533;s kid.So the whole story is about revenge.  Granted, Shakespeare did pretty well with that subject, but traditionally, it doesn&#65533;t allow for much character development, and less emotion, other than &#65533;we got the bad guys!  Yippee!&#65533;  This is &#65533;Road&#65533;s&#65533; biggest flaw: the plot, when all else is stripped away, is pencil-thin and the characters ultimately two-dimensional.  Hanks and Newman both turn in stellar performances, but their characters aren&#65533;t as memorable Hoechlin&#65533;s, simply because he was given more of a chance to develop and show a range of human emotions.  And, all of them are beaten out by Jude Law, who manages to turn a bit-character into the most memorable one in the film.Like last year&#65533;s &#65533;A Beautiful Mind,&#65533; &#65533;Road to Perdition&#65533; smacks of Oscar grooming.  With top-notch directors like Mendes, cinematographers like Conrad Hall, and actors like Hanks and Newman, it&#65533;s hard to go wrong, but like that chocolate bunny, there just isn&#65533;t anything underneath the exoskeleton.  Whether it&#65533;s because the plot was thin (there are repeated ideas of &#65533;family,&#65533; but &#65533;The Godfather&#65533; blew &#65533;RTP&#65533; out of the water on that count) or a poor script for the main actors, the film ultimately sinks under its own weight.  Add to that a heavy-handed voiceover at the end telling you exactly how to feel (unlike the appropriately ambiguous one in &#65533;American Beauty,&#65533;) and you&#65533;ve got a movie for the masses and the Academy, but thinking filmgoers looking for that solid chocolate will have to look somewhere else.  &#65533;Road to Perdition&#65533; is beautiful and tasty, but it&#65533;s all fluff and style with zero in the substance department.Final Grade: D

$review_text.: It's a cast of stars in a western (sometimes comedic) that's fun but not entirely memorable. Frank Sinatra & Dean Martin are the stars; they're not friends but have to team up in order to keep their gambling riverboats afloat (literally & figuratively). Other stars include Anita Ekberg (Sinatra's woman), Ursala Andress (Martin's woman), Victor Buono, Charles Bronson (a really nasty bad guy) & The Three Stooges (in a scene of comic relief).The film is directed by the great Robert Aldrich who also produced & co-wrote the screenplay, but there's little doubt about who  was in control of the product: Frank Sinatra.Ekberg & Andress are wonderful to look at but are not great actresses. It's a case of, once again, Hollywood importing foreign actresses for roles not suited for them. Ms. Ekberg in particular is weak. Ms. Andress isn't half bad but American actresses would've been better suited for these roles. I don't have anything against them being from elsewhere, I certainly enjoy viewing them, it's just a case of bad casting.The final fight scene is an excellent one that took a lot of work. It's highlighted in the bonus feature as a behind-the scenes documentary. This isn't a great work of art but it is entertaining.

$review_text.: DH Lawrence's novels may be tough to translate to the screen, so much of his writing is dependent on the words on the page as they form images of extraordinary beauty and sensuality. His novels are quintessentially British and reflect on the dehumanizing effects of modernity and industrialization, confronting issues relating to emotional health and vitality, spontaneity, sexuality, and human instinct. During his lifetime he was even labeled a pornographer, but that was then and now is now, and under the gifted guidance of director/writer (with Roger Bohbot and Pierre Trividic) Pascale Ferran, Lawrence's exquisite tale of sexual awakening has found what for this viewer is the finest transition of the novel to the screen.The place is England after WW I and Sir Clifford Chatterley (Hippolyte Girardot) is the paraplegic wealthy husband of Constance/Lady Chatterley (a radiant Marina Hands). Quite apropos for the era, Constance tends to her impotent husband, does needlepoint, and takes walks to while away her boredom. On one of her walks she encounters the gamekeeper Parkin (Jean-Louis Coullo'ch), seeing a partially nude man for the first time in her life. The impact awakens her somnolent sexuality and she manages to visit Parkin daily, gradually allowing her lust to unfold. Parkin is 'below her class' but is a masculine, sensuous embodiment of everything Constance has never experienced. They slowly bond and both of them become passionately in love, finding lovemaking in Parkin's hut, in the woods, in the rain - wherever they encounter. Constance wants to have a baby and convinces Clifford that she can become impregnated and the resulting child would be 'Clifford's' by pact. Constance travels to London, the Riviera, and other ports, only to return home believing that Parkin has reclaimed his ex-wife. But there are many surprises that greet her and the manner in which the story resolves (in Ferran's hands) leaves us unsure of the future.The film is captured amidst the beauties of the natural world - flowers, trees, springs, brooks - and these aspects of the natural world are an influential part of Constance's sexual awakening. Yes, there are scenes of complete nudity and love making but they are photographed so well byJulian Hirsch that they become an integral part of the story. The musical score by B&eacute;atrice Thiriet finds the right quality of elegance and sensuality. If there is a problem with this nearly three-hour film it is in the editing by Yann Dedet and Mathilde Muyard that takes liberties with scene transitions that prove disruptive.But it would be hard to imagine two actors who could match the subtlety and sexual tension that Marina Hands and Jean-Louis Coullo'ch to this film. It is breathtakingly beautiful to experience DH Lawrence's story in the hands of the French crew and cast. Grady Harp, December 07

$review_text.: There have been many reviews here which have given the blow-by-blow of the plot behind the movie.  They have focused upon Andrew Largeman's return to his hometown following the death of his mother and his short journey back to himself and the people and circumstances that shook up his life and set him in a direction that will bring him from being numb to feeling life again for the first time in many years.Yes - this is a big part of the film.AND what delighted me more than the plot was the artistry that was exhibited in the story telling.  Actors filled supporting roles and cameo roles with incredible intensity and flavor, take Jean Smart, who played the mother of one of Andrew Largeman's best friends from his home town who now spends his time taking hits from a bong while at home and digging graves while at work.The role of Andrew's father, a Psychiatrist who has medicated his son into a no-feeling state for year-after-year-after-year was admirably played by Ian Holm.There was a woman who sang at the mother's funeral who was SOOOO New Jersey I was amazed: I am not sure of her name but I did love her moments on stage.I was completely wrapped up in the storytelling - I wondered about the metaphors unfolding (such as one with Andrew and Sam sitting on a staircase at an airport with an escalator constantly in motion behind them.)  I wondered: was that on purpose, about movement and life and being stuck in life or am I putting WAYYYY too much into this?I loved watching Andrew come back to life - when talking to his father he said, "I was a little boy and some one made a sh*tty latch" - and that latch defined the intervening years of his life and now, now NOW he was choosing differently.I adored "meeting" Sam with all her beloved eccentricities - she reminded me of what I imagine my youngest daughter will become - I had to have my eight-year-old daughter watch the scene where Andrew "witnessed a completely original moment" and I wondered what would happen if we each became conscious of creating completely original moments?And then there was the surprising geological find... in Newark, NJ and another line I will carry with me forever - "Have fun exploring the infinite abyss" and exactly the perfect response, "You, too."He could have been speaking to you - or me - or your neighbor, your best friend.I was moved to tears when Andrew began to parent his father, "We have to work on being OK" not to fabricate that we were happy.  Very powerful.  What if we all worked on being OK?Zach Braff was incredible - goofy smile and all. Natalie Portman did an incredibly subtle and believable New Jersey accent....(I grew up in NJ, whether or not it makes me an expert is up for question, I suppose.)This movie, obviously, will stick with me. I hope you will watch it with your heart and mind wide open... and enjoy exploring the infinite abyss.

$REVIEW.: Just watched a full thirteen hours of this just-released DVD.  Wow!This series just keeps getting better and better.  In spite of being involved in a violent lifestyle, each character comes across as very human.  I relate to them all.  And somehow, the writing is so good that I feel I'm right there, a member of the family.  These episodes fit together beautifully, and are part of the great mosaic that has been delighting viewers for the past three years.  I just recently became an HBO subscriber and actually saw only one or two episodes before the season ended.  But I'm all caught up now, after also viewing Seasons One and Two on DVD and can't wait to watch it week by week as the Season Four begins.One of the things I love most about the series is the depth of understanding the writers have of human nature.  The action of the story is true to the personalities of each character.  And afterward I can understand why their hard choices could only go one way, given who they are.  For example, there is a brutal rape episode in which the viewer wonders what will happen next.  Afterwards, however, because of previously established characterizations, I could understand that the episode couldn't have concluded in any other way.  There is also a humanization of one of the girls who work at the strip club, changing forever the viewer's perception of the realities of the trade.I've come to love Carmela with all her soul searching about her role of a Mafia wife.  And of course there is Tony with all his humanity, and some very erotic scenes with a seemingly sophisticated new lady friend.  Their relationship sparks and then disintegrates quite quickly and the attraction followed by repulsion was easy to understand.  Tony's children and his family life keep getting more interesting.  Meadow is at college now and has to deal with new relationships while still tied to the familiar.  And A.J. is showing signs of the same kind of panic attacks that affect his father. Tony's mother dies in the first episode and what follows regarding his sister's Janet's reaction is exactly the kind of scatterbrained nonsense mixed with cruelty that we've all come to expect from her.Tony's Mafia family is still true to what we've come to expect.  This year it's Ralphie we all love to hate. And then there's Jackie Jr. whose stupidity leads to tragedy. Tony still has feelings of guilt about previous acts of violence.  But I just love the fact that there are flashbacks instead of some of the silly dream sequences that appeared in episodes during the first two years.As a total package, this third year gets another super high recommendation.  Don't miss it.  But be sure to see the first two years in order to put it all in perspective.

$REVIEW.: I hadn't even heard of this film until 2 weeks ago, and read a byline which said it was 'terrifying' - yeah yeah, read that all the time, and they never are,Well my god, this film had me on the edge of my seat!Basically, 2 men wake up chained to pipes in what appears to be a public loo.  In between them is a body - and clues left for them to help them escape by a certain time, or they die.  This is like a sick game show, as you watch them try to solve the clues to escape.  This is interspersed with flashbacks with the police attending the scene of other victims, and you watch their gruesome deaths in a similar way to Seven, which is the only film to compare this too.It truly is a sick and shocking film, but I thought it very original and 'non' Hollywood which was very refreshing.  Watching the 'victims' terror is uncomfortable, but I am so glad I saw this film. (No pun intended).  Of the 4 that went to see it with me, all thought it fantastic, 2 have been genuinely affected by it since.

$review_text.: I have owened a couple of the Firm DVD before this one. They both challaged me, and were great. The results that I am getting from working with these DVDs are great. I found this set to be challenging too. I used my regular step instead of the fanny lifter, and I used weights to replace the sculpting stick. Most the low rating reviews I read didn't stop me from buying this DVD and I am glad. People need to know that the rating should be for the DVD it self, not what it didn't come with!!! Believe me there are results on my body after working out with those DVDs.

$REVIEW.: The movie itself is ok.  Some interesting new faces, the storyline is actually good.  I was surprised by some of the young actors, and it was nice to see some familiar faces from smoke signals.  If you like smoke signals you will like this.  There is only ONE reason I give it an an ehhh its okay rating.  It is the same reason that will kill any good even &#34;would have been great&#34; movie had they left ONE DARN element out of the film. . . . . (and I would be using a much stronger word here if I could) WHY ON EARTH, do these new film makers feel it is necessary to have a vomit scene?  SERIOUSLY?  And right at the camera??????COME ON!!!!!!!!!I am sick to death of it! It's gross, uneccesary and brings on anxiety over whether or not they are going to do it again in the film and for those of you who DO NOT like scenes like that . . . don't buy this film.If they had just left that crud out of the film this would have gotten five stars.  The setting is realistic, the story line is believeable and the actors did a great job, and because of this one gross element, personally, it just killed the DARN movie.  I'll probably end up selling it at a garage sale this summer for a dollar just so I don't make the mistake of being exposed to that again.Enough with the throw up scenes, it's just unecesary.  There have been plenty of great films made without this overdone transparent shock value tactic of showing someone throwing up.  It doesn't IMPACT me as a viewer to emphasize anything in a positive light . . . this kind of impact is just a gross factor that makes me feel like I wasted my money and will end up tossing. If you have a strong stomach . . then hey, it won't bother you.  But for those of who do . . . .pass it up.

$review_text.: This might come off rather odd but this film makes me regret being a sci-fi fan in some ways, more so in my liking of the Star Wars franchise. The problem with this film isn't the story, the story itself is actually not to bad. The problem comes from the characters and the truly awful script.The character's are pretty generic for a "geek" comedy. You have your normal guy, your over-the-edge geek insecure guy, your hot babe, your over-the-edge geek funny guy, etc. It's a safe cast, but definitely not memorable, because they are so generic. Each character viewed separately seem to be the right fit for the movie, but when they are all put together, they seem to not work to well together. As you watch the movie, it feels like each character bounces off of each other instead of having a free flowing dialog, which can make the movie a little irritating to watch (and listen to) at times.As I had mentioned before, the story itself is not to bad. The story centered around the pre-release of Episode I when a group of Star Wars fans trying to break into Skywalker Ranch in order to steal a copy of Star Wars: Episode I for their dying friend who won't live long enough to see it in theaters when it is released. They run into quirky set backs along the way but basically you already know the ending result. As I had mentioned, it is not a bad story by far, but it is also not a very memorable one.By far the worst part of this movie is the script. As you can imagine, a movie about Star Wars fans is going to be riddled with Star Wars one-liners. This movie is filled with those one-liners to the point of narcissism. No character can go one sentence without saying some kind of reference pertaining to Star Wars in some way. It's not to bad at the beginning, but when you hear these one-liners for about an hour, they start getting old REALLY FAST! The script starts loosing its touch and you start to cringe whenever you hear a Star Wars reference. Honestly, being a Star Wars fan myself since childhood, I started to seriously question myself if I sound like them, and I hoped to God Almighty that I didn't.I can understand the attraction one might have in seeing this movie. Majority of our generation grew up watching Star Wars and have some sort of bond with the films, thus making us all 'FanBoys' to some degree, but do not feel any kind of duty to watch this film. This movie was not made 'for FanBoys', it was made by actors portraying to 'be FanBoys' to an obnoxious degree. It's not the worst movie you will ever see, but it more than likely will be one of the most irritating.

$REVIEW.: I know I am one of the only people on the planet who doesn't go into automatic orgasm when Vin Diesel is in a movie, but the simple truth of the matter is he was best thing about this movie, and it was hardly a sterling performance.  Take your basic summer camp slasher film with an unseen killer and put it in outer space.  There you go!  That's it.  It's been done before, and much better.  I did enjoy the lore of the planet that they just mysteriously seemed to deduce from almost no clues at all.  I find it fascinating that people talk about the character development -- you get just as deep development in any Jason/Freddy/Michael Myers film.

$review_text.: "Rosemary's Baby" is a classic horror story, well-acted by a team of top-flight actors and well-directed by Roman Polanski. A young Manhattan couple seem completely unlikely for what befalls them, but the husband (John Cassavetes) is an ambitious actor who may be willing to deal with the devil and evil forces to get ahead in the theater. His wife (Mia Farrow), wan and chalky-looking, is the innocent foil who becomes a vessel through which he can achieve success. The couple goes apartment hunting in the famous Dakota apartment building. The Gothic rooftops of the famous building help to build up a sense of dread, gloom and doom.Three great character actors--Ralph Bellamy, Sidney Blackmer, and Maurice Evans do yeoman work in the movie. Blackmer and the incomparable Ruth Gordon are the old couple next door, garishly dressed, wacky, crass. Who could ever believe that such a batty couple could be running a witches' coven in the next door apartment?The story sneaks up, creeps up on you subtly and with teasing deliberateness. It seems so ordinary and commonplace at first. What will Rosemary's actor husband do to get a juicy part--sell his soul and her body to get a juicy part?A suicide early in the movie makes Rosemary suspicious of her flamboyant and eccentric neighbors. They and their friends seem so removed from anything dangerous.This is a great, masterful movie that spawned a number of sequels. It has often been twinned with "The Exorcist."
$SUMMARY.: A Great Achievement!

$review_text.: All right...I've read the Customer Reviews. I've seen the movie twice.And I still don't understand.Why are we bashing Malevolence? Detour, The Hazing, and The Amityville Horror remake have better customer ratings than Malevolence.Malevolence bashers: Does this strike you as odd?Honestly, I loved this movie. I thought this was a scary, smart homage to Halloween that found a series of effective scares and a gorgeous sense of atmosphere. Don't tell me you weren't impressed by the killer's lair. Ordinary junk has never seemed so threatening. And the Bone Deer...What a beautiful piece of work. It's the kind of minimalistic and brutally effective set piece that's been missing from modern horror. The masters of horror recognize the impact moments like this have. They get under your skin. I'm not saying Steven Mena is a Carpenter or Argento. But I think some of you would agree that he shows great promise. In his first outing, he created a film that has jumps, whose meanacing presence lingers when the film is over. These days, most Hollywood releases go for one or the other. I love the B-Movie Horror Flick as much as the next guy, but it's great to see a film that strips horror down to it's core quality: Primal Fear. I haven't been this excited by a small horror movie since Session 9.Let's give Mena credit where credit is due. If you all want nothing but B-Movie, direct to video horror / Japanese imports (or poor American remakes of) for the rest of your lives, that's cool. But it's time to recognize that some directors are trying to give horror it's good name back, regardless of how successful we think they are (and on that, we all seem to differ.) Just remember: Rome wasn't built in a day

$REVIEW.: Anyone who would give a movie like this 5 stars obviously hasn't seen very many movies.  I doubt that any of the major actors in the film would think of giving it that high of a score.  It's making fun of great movies (like Meatballs) and lesser movies of the 80's.  It's just a parody.  Even a great movie like Meatballs (with superior acting, directing and production) doesn't deserve 5 stars.  There are some funny scenes in the film, but that's about it.  I'd rather watch Meatballs, or the State.

$review_text.: After reading all the "greatest unknown film ever" reviews here, I gave this a shot. The first 30 minutes or so are truly engrossing, but once Walsh disappears from the film it all gets rather routine. The main problem is that Dembo starts out as likeable, but then you see that we've been given a false impression; the guy is really just a violent and rather stupid prick. There is a promise of redemption that quickly fades and all we're left with is a semi-realistic portrayal of a pretty boring hoodlum with no imagination and no love for anything but the rush of the next caper.I say semi-realistic because Hoffman is certainly solid but I just can't buy him as Dembo. There is too much intelligence in Dembo/Hoffman's eyes for him to be this selfish and stupid. As for this being his best role ever, give me a break. Not even close. The character offers nowhere near the levels of complexity that Dustin reaches in many other films.The supporting cast is excellent; two of the great character actors of their generation, Stanton and Walsh, are both tremendous. [Spoilers coming] The best thing in the film is the look in Harry's eyes just before he croaks; subtle and so much more real than most Hollywood deaths.Russell is good but offers no discernible reason for putting up with Dembo's bs. And Walsh's character could EASILY find Dembo by finding her after he escapes; Dembo told him who she was! That's the biggest flaw in this script, which is ultimately an above-average 70s character study but no masterpiece.It was a great decade for this introverted, European attitude towards examining motivation, but Straight Time left me feeling kind of cheated by the end. It starts so strongly and ends so pointlessly. Maybe that's the point, but it feels rather hollow.Sure, it may be more realisitic than most cop/crime flicks, but that hardly makes it the masterpiece that other reviewers here claim it to be.It's very good, but it's a long way from genius.

I bought it mostly for Harper and Drowning pool. Both are fun solid movies that I enjoy immensely. But to my surprise I also enjoyed all the others with the Young Philidalphians being the one I consider the best film in the series.It has given me a new perspective on the films of Mr.Newman. He was a top notch actor and it is unfortunate that his type are fast fading from our view.I hope more people will try out these films in one form or another. They desrve a look and will entertain you.

$review_text.: A Star Is Born explores the dark underbelly of a ruthless Hollywood. Judy Garland plays Esther Blodget whose star is on the rise while her famous husband played by James Mason is on the way down.Garland is superb in the musical numbers but struggles with some of the dramatics. To be fair director Cukor places huge demands on her with many long scenes. It's ironic that Garland plays the wife of a fading alcoholic star...In its restored version this film is very long at 3 hours, and the photographs used to fill in the gaps where the film is missing is rather off-putting.For its time this is quite a hard-hitting film, unglamorous in its depiction of an unforgiving business. There is very little musical score -outside of the musical numbers - of course, which makes this film seem more modern. Cukor lets the actors tell the story.The film's musical numbers are superb and the film is a great tribute to the talent of Garland. George Cukor's direction is also striking. Visually the film is superb. Definitely worth seeing.

It is a lot of fun and I almost didn't see it due to the harsh critical pounding this movie has been taking


It isn't as good as X-Men 2 or Batman Begins, but I prefer it over Hulk and the Spiderman films

The acting and special effects are good, but both are lacking at times


Jessica Alba is one of the hottest women on the planet and is a nice visual treat that makes up for her decent acting skills

The Human Torch and The Thing were both great in the acting department (loved the back and forth trash talk) and were the best characters in my opinion


Mr

Fantastic was a boring nerd, but that is what his part called for and he played it well
Dr


Doom was much better than expected and I liked the fact that the actor didn't overact the part to the degree that we are use to in comic book films


Go see this film with low expectations and you will be surprised big time

This is a worthy addition to the Marvel movie franchise.

I remember the theme music (not on the DVD, by the way) for the series and the guy with the flashlight...just like everyone else who grew up with tv in the 70s. I really looked forward to the release of McMillan and Wife and McCloud, especially since I hadn't seen many episodes since my childhood.The script-writing is awful. The plots are lousy. Susan St. James is VERY cute. John Schuck is funny enough. But everyone else is boring. In one episode, Rock Hudson's fake punch is SO FAKE, it was laughable. I didn't buy the set to laugh AT the show! Oh, well...I am desperately waiting for December 6th and the release of season one of The Rockford Files.

$review_text.: Some movies are great because of their fine acting, some because of their fascinating stories, others because of their depth of character and still others because of the moods they evoke.  And then there are those rare films that seem to have it all.This movie has it all.From amazing performances, to believable and likeable characters, to a fascinating, original storyline, to laughter and tears, Finding Neverland does not disappoint on any level.Johnny Depp is truly amazing.  There is no other actor who can create original characters and make them multidimensional the way Depp can.  Depp's Barrie is a shy, sensitive, creative genius filled with warmth and humor. I can't imagine any other actor who could play Barrie with that kind of believability.  Pitt?  Too shallow and untested.  Cruise?  Too self-involved.  Crowe?  Too rough around the edges.  (Pay attention during the parlor scene in Sylvia's house when James relates to Sylvia the story of his mother after the death of James's brother.  He has never spoken of his unique fantasy--Neverland--to anyone before this, he tells her.  Depp's delivery is remarkable.  Watch the subtle movements in his expression.  The eyes, the shy smile.  Incredible.)And Kate Winslet puts in an outstanding performance as Sylvia, a woman who has her priorities in the right places.  She made me want to go home, trade my PC for Play-Doh and spend my time with my kids.Although I don't think Depp and Winslet are an obvious couple, and there's never anything physical between Sylvia and James, the depth of love shown by these characters is obvious and genuine. Once again, it would be hard to picture other actors in their places.Freddie Highmore's performance as Peter is garnering all the attention, and rightfully so, but all the boys are extraordinary.  They are so convincing that it is hard to believe these boys are from the present century.  There's not a one who doesn't represent his character as if he were in fact a Llewellyn Davies.The scenery and the music also evoke another, more innocent era, strengthening the mood of the film.Even the fringe characters--Radha Mitchell as cold Mary Barrie, Dustin Hoffman as James's dry-humored business manager, and Julie Christie as Sylvia's stern, protective mother--hit the mark.And director Marc Forster was robbed of an opportunity to win an Oscar, having not even been nominated.  The scenes are so original, so well-thought-through, they are Oscar worthy by far.Anyone who appreciates a warm story filled with rich performances will find Finding Neverland rewarding.
$SUMMARY.: Finding Neverland is an awfully great adventure.

$REVIEW.: I don't like Scorsese; I like some of his movies, "TAXI DRIVER" for example, but who doesn't?However, since I like flying very much, I watched the movie before buying it -suddenly I got old and became a logic person when it comes to buying things!!- again I got another logic reason for not liking Scorsese.Then I was astonished by the number of reviews in Amazon. And trusting that I would not add new negative things about the movie, I collected all beautiful ideas from previous negative reviews and revive it here (since positive reviews are repeated stereotypes); enjoy it, and don't buy the movie:"I LOVE Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn, but as Howard Hughes' mental state starts to decline, so does the movie.""And then there is the acting. Every time Leonardo opens his mouth we are reminded, not of Howard Hughes, but of Leonardo DiCaprio pretending to speak with a Texas accent. DiCaprio is never convincing as Hughes""I now see why "Million Dollar Baby" won Best Picture..., ...Because "The Aviator" loses major steam the second that Cate Blanchette (Hepburn) disappears from the screen.""Simply put, the movie completely ignores the drug/psychiatric connection to Hughes' eventual collapse. Always an eccentric Hughes became a morphine addict after his near fatal crash. This led to a string of psychiatric treatments that simply did what they do best.... drugged the poor man into dementia.""Movies like this are the reason intelligent Americans emigrate abroad. This film is pure American onanistic navel gazing. I guess we're left now only with monumentalizing our lunatics, and then by young actors of average intelligence and ability who look good on camera.""this film would be put in the back room of every Blobkbuster so nobody would have to even look at the cover when they passed the "A" section.""I just wish I could have felt some sympathy for the emotionally tortured Hughes. As played by Leonardo Di Caprio, the character seemed a caricature. Whenever he tried to show emotion, he just crinkled his forehead. As the film went on character aged the makeup people made that forehead crease deeper and deeper.""PS Yes I did give this DVD to a friend (with a warning) and requested that it not be returned.""In my entire 59 years I've never seen such a piece of ....""It's hard to believe this film was nominated for anything other than the dust bin. The dialogue is pedantic at times, preposterous at others, and has enough gee-whiz in it to make it sound like a bad Mickey Rooney film.""In an early scene, Hughes flies the famous H-1 at 350 miles per hour in an open cockpit without goggles. Unless there is direct evidence that this happened, I find it hard to believe. The CG graphics look very fake to me as well. The scenes of filming Hells Angels are clearly what I call digital masturbation.""If one *must* see this atrocity then may I respectfully suggest it be *rented* it first?Don't purchase it new. (~look at the number of "used" copies, eh?)""The glitz and glamour circa 1920's-40's is very well represented; unfortunately, as I've stated a couple of paragraphs earlier, the person (DiCaprio's Hughes) we're supposed to be experiencing this through is merely a fly on the wall himself. I bet you Andy Kaufman's impersonation of Howard Hughes would've had more depth to it! "Hello....I'm Howard Hughes."""I found this film, as a whole, weird. Some of the soundtrack music was annoying, and reminded me of some of the music from "Bugsy," Warren Beatty's early 1990s film. It was just eery, strange, or downright annoying.""If you think you'd find a three-hour movie about the wart on Franklin Delano Roosevelt's face to be fascinating, then "The Aviator," is definitely the movie for you. Who knows, maybe Martin and Leonardo will team up to film an FDR wart epic.""why did anyone bother to spend the money to film this dog?""This movie is boring as hell, and then some..Avoid it if you can, unless you want to keep the seat warm for no reason at all.Only the plain crash was filmed cool.. but then again.. Discovery Channel has them too.""However, the acting by Leo was not that great and a little embarrassing to watch. His Texas drawl (trying hard to sound like Howard Hughes) was sad to watch. Also, he did not look like Howard Hughes (Howard was better looking).""It was created for the sole purpose of getting a Grammy. It tried too hard to dazzle the audience with special effects and frightening drama, while DiCaprio dealt an embarrassingly dramatic role as Hughes. Stay away from this movie. It will be a very excruciating three hours of your life.""But from the beginning things are just not right. Leo isn't bad, but cleanshaven, he still appears to be a boy and that's a big problem. Leo standing up to Alan Alda or even Alec Baldwin is a tough sell. Given that there is no resemblance to Hughes, any actor with hair in his eyes could have played the role.""I do not recommend viewing this at all, unless you want to spend two or three hours watching a deeply disturbed man slowly destroy himself, and at one point rolling around nude in an empty room, screaming in agony and urinating in milk bottles for 20 to 30 minutes.""Scorsese has lost his balls to the whores of the Hollywood system."This was the result of 240 reviews. I might come back for more from the next 500 reviews if you vote for the idea. If you want to read a positive review, read anyone, they are all the same.

$REVIEW.: The Voice is familiar: It belongs to reporter Carl Kolchak: "This is the story behind the most incredible series of murders to ever occur in the city of Seattle, Washington. You never read about them in your local newspapers or heard about them on your local radio or television station. Why? Because the facts were watered down, torn apart and reassembled, - in a word, falsified."The Night Strangler is a made for TV movie sequel to the Night Stalker. It takes place in Seattle, Washington. Here Carl Kolchak is reunited with his old editor, the vocal Tony Vincenzo. In this case, Kolchak is investigating a series of murders of young women. With the help of a research clerk they uncover a series of serial murders going back nearly a century and repeating every 21 years, tracking down the perpetrator.This sequel is excellent and one of the few good Jack the Ripper movies, with a unique twist. The film shows an extensive underground city. I took a trip to Seattle to see this, and it is not as extensive as the film.

$review_text.: I am a great Maggie Smith fan, so when I found this movie, I had to see it.  I must say, in my opinion I would classify it as an "Artsy-Fartsy" movie... but in spite of that, I LOVED IT.  To a certain degree, I think everyone can identify with a life full of pains and sorrows, and still being able to help out others when they are in need.  This is the description of true humanity... to see past your own pains, and lend a hand to someone else. The only thing in my opinion that makes this unsuitable for pre-teens, other than excessive alcohol consumption to mask emotional pain, is that there is a quick flash of Mrs Delahuntys upper torso, at one point.

$REVIEW.: CliffHanger made in 1993 is one of the most exciting action films on screen. The stunts and location in the movie are unbelievable.It stars Sylvester Stallone as Gabriel Walker, and (Michael Rooker)as Hal Tucker as 2 climbing experts whose friendship comes to an end, when Tucker's girlfriend , Sarahfalls to her death while climbing when Gabe tries to rescue her. Tucker blames Walker for the accident and hasn't forgiven him ever since.Jess Dieghan ( Janine Turner) plays Gabriel girlfriend and coworker on these hi-risk rock climbing jobs.The basic plot in CliffHanger is that a group of terrorists led by a madman named Qualin (John Lighgow) are stealing money from the Treasury Department and making their escape through an airplane. Mr. Travers is the Treasury Agent who is assigned the task of showing an FBI agent, Mr. Mateson, how to find the sum of money that was stolen from Treasury department. However, Mr. Mateson's true job is to find the traitor inside the Treasury Department. It just so happens that Mr. Mateson, is on the same airplane that the terrorist, and the traitoris, and in a really great scene, blows away a couple of the terrorists and puts their plan to steal the money on hold.Eventually, Mr. Qualin and his remaining terrorists friends escape, but not before the money they stole gets tossed into the icy mountains below them. Qualin and his friends, stranded on the mountains, and angry about losing their money, come up a with a plan to get back.They pretend to be stranded on the mountains, and call in a rescue team to get them, and to eventually force them to get their money.The rescue team answers and you guessed it, it's Gabe Walker and his ex friend Hal Tucker who answer the call.Now the action really stars and Gabe, and his friends must try to find a way to stop the madman Qualin and his terrorists.There are really some amazing stunts in Cliffhanger. There are great action scenes, including a big avalanche scene, there is also a great scene in which Gabe literallysurfs on the ice while avoiding the machine gun bullets of the terrorists chasing them.Stallone's character, Gabe is also a very smart guy, he comes up with some pretty good plans to foil Qualin's plan, while at the same time using his strong muscles as an added weapon. Stallone is his usual calm and cool self, delivering the smart, but lethal Walker, and gives his character some depth throughout the movie.John Lighgow is also great as Qualin. Litghow has made a good career playing the psycho. In the memorable Ricochet, his acting as the psychotic left a lasting impression with me.Now there's probably some people who already have seen Cliffhanger before, but the DVD delivers the movie in a way you haven't seen beforeDvd features:* Trailer*Special look at the specialeffects of the movie*Deleted scenesThe movie was directed by Renny Harlin, another one of those directors that don't get the spotlight but who have directed many blockbuster movies including:*Die Hard 2*DrivenFurthermore, the hits that Harlin has directed have been made intogames: Cliffhanger was made for the Sega Genesis, Supernes and Gameboy. The games for it, are actually pretty good. Likewise Die Hard 2 was made for the pc and Playstation, along with Driven for the Gameboy Advance.So Cliffhanger is an awesome movie, and now with the special DVD for it, it's definitely worth seeing once again.
$SUMMARY.: Cliffhanger a blockbuster hit!!

$review_text.: I remember watching and loving Xanadu as a kid, but watching it now at 29, all I can say is that this is one strange movie.  Nothing in it makes sense -- the protagonist (Michael Beck) is a lazy artist who falls for a muse (Olivia Newton-John) who is sent to him for inspiration or some silly reason that the movie never makes clear, except to give them musical montages featuring "Magic", Olivia's big hit at the time. Actually that is the real reason for the movie's existence:  the music, and admittedly, the music is very good.Along with the music, the film does have some interesting aspects including the roller disco scenes.  They are well-choreographed even if they are tacky.  And the movie's fashions and hairstyles (shot in '79/'80) are a curious hybrid of late 70s culture and 80s fashions/trends and to the film's credit, it eerily predicts the fashions/trends of the 80s (much of what is seen onscreen would be popular in just a few years -- 1983/84).

$REVIEW.: David Oaks of 'The Borgias" leads a cast of well rounded actors in this neither slasher nor Torture Porn film as the trailer would have you believe.It is instead a great at times genius Physiological Thriller.It starts off at a Christmas party where some college students are partying and playing a risque game of Truth or Dare.You have all the usual characters varying from the sweet girl to the jerk.Enter Felix an introverted,shy boy with no self esteem,something that he finds traumatizing happens and then it cuts to months later and all the kids that were involved in the shaming of Felix are invited to his elaborate estate for his Birthday Party,problem is the party isn't in the huge castle like estate but way back in the woods behind it in a shack plus Felix isn't there to welcome them but instead his very willing brother "Oaks' who is of Military mindset who holds them captive to play 'his' version of Truth or Dare.The surprises keep coming and coming as the rest of the story unfolds.It's an amazing plot that might seem cliche' at first but just wait.It's a story about revenge and then some. There is a shortage of effects and gore but I still give it 5 stars because of the acting ,story and revelations along the journey.

$REVIEW.: &quot;Rush in Rio&quot; is a great opportunity to see the power trio in full form. Yes, the sound has a bit too much crowd in it, but that's what Alex,Geddy and Neil wanted. To reproduce what it's like to see the band live. They're &quot;last&quot; tour is in 2004. Its the 30th anniversary of Rush. Who knows if you will see them again?I think its interesting that many of the &quot;older&quot; rock bands are finding a more loyal following in Europe and South America. Why? Because WE are forced to listen to the &quot;light&quot; cr*p on the airwaves in North America.Rush is a Canadian institution that we, as Canadians, should be very proud of.Alex, Geddy and Neil are devoted to their musical craftsmanship. Geddy describes themselves as always trying to better themselves as each year passes. &quot;We are Musicians first&quot; is what he says. &quot;That's what Rush has been all about&quot; How true.Rush is about complexity, style and meticulous musical craftsmanship. Neil and Alex have been consistantly recognized as world class drummer and guitarist respectively. Alex being listed as one of the top 100 greatest guitarists ever by Guitar World Magazine.Neil's drum solo in &quot;O Baterista&quot; is wonderful, and ends on a big band flourish, which again, shows his wide ranging abilities.What amazes me about Neil is his concentration and stamina. Not once do you see a bead of sweat on this always moving drummer. Amazing.Geddy Lee always displays his wide ranging musical experience by singing, playing bass, keyboards and pedal bass. Pretty good voice still after singing 29+ years.This DVD gives you and opportunity to see and hear one of the best, but underated, rock powerhouses in recent history.Buy this DVD, you won't be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: This is the third incarnation of "Bambi" on video, but the first time on DVD.  The last VHS presentation showed the film in a digitally spruced up version, but the new version on DVD is a miracle of restoration - an inspired release.Seldom - or perhaps never - has Hollywood ever given us a more beautiful motion picture, one that is the embodiment of innocence and love.  The opening sequence, displaying superb use of Disney Studios' Multi-Plane Camera, is worth the price of the DVD alone.The 53-minute documentary, "The Making of Bambi", goes far deeper than ever before in showing how difficult it was to get "Bambi" released during a time of world war and union strikes, and how people of the day did not appreciate this masterpiece in the way it would later be embraced for all time.As mentioned in books and on the VHS releases, Walt Disney himself considered "Bambi" his "personal favorite".  After experiencing this DVD release, it's little wonder why he felt that way.

With the DVD, without all the commercial breaks, it is a lot easier to see how the story plays out.Season one really introduces you to the various characters and sets the basis for the plot line. Watching it again on DVD, I often felt like I was watching a new story as I finally got to see how all the changes fit together. If you like the show, you will love the DVD.

$review_text.: Just some thoughts...Escape From New York (1981) is one of those movies that has stayed with me throughout the years, even if I go many many years without seeing it.  It has that kind of power.  This movie stars a lot of John Carpenter alumni from previous films he made, such as Donald Pleasence, Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, and Charles Cyphers.  Kurt Russell, who plays Snake Plissken, went on to star in Carpenter's remake of The Thing (1982).  I like Isaac Hayes in his role as the self-proclaimed The Duke Of New York.  The Duke is my favorite character in the movie.  I like the vehicle he drives as well.  Donald Pleasence is great in his role as the President of the United States.  Basically the plot is this:  The future has a crime rate that is out of control, and New York City is now a maximum security prison.  The President has been captured by inmates after Air Force One crashes in New York, and a man named Snake Plissken has the goal of freeing the President within 24 hours so the President can attend an international summit.  Does he make it?This is a movie that has become a cult classic.  The special effects are low tech, the budget is low, but the movie is awesome.  The musical score by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth is great as usual.I highly recommend this classic low budget movie.

$REVIEW.: After momentarily forgetting the finale of the third movie - after raving about it in my Amazon review - I was looking forward to watching the 'final' Aliens movie (not taking into account the Alien vs Predator movies here). I definitely reckon the third movie was my favourite, but I'm still kinda disappointed about Resurrection.I'm still in two minds about it. I really think they should have ended it with Aliens 3 - I won't go into how they brought back Ripley, but I think, personally, that it was a cop out, and seemed too easy. I'm still not sure I understand how the alien came back either, it just seemed too easy.Apart from that, the rest of the movie was great. That's my main gripe with the movie. I still didn't like Ripley's character in this - I didn't like her in the first movie either, but her character was developed in two and three. In this, they seem to have reverted her back to her original portrayal. Although my heart did go out to her at the end. Wow. What an ending.The cast in this was excellent. Winona Ryder was an excellent casting choice, as was Ron Perlman (my birthday twin), and although it bugged me for ages where I knew Michael Wincott from (Robin Hood Princes of Thieves people), he was brilliant too, if not a little cocky.This has some of the best scenes in all of the movies. Ron Perlman hanging just by his legs on a ladder - ouch. And the underwater scenes, in which all actors were alleged to have trouble (including Winona, who has a fear of water), were just amazing. I was holding my breath quite a lot. For some reason, gimme water in a movie, and I love it. But I hate being in it myself. (I must have drowned in a previous life.)Apart from the disappointment of the way Ripley was brought back, I still did enjoy Resurrection, although it did dampen my excitement a little bit. They could have found a better way to bring her back, or not done the movie at all. My favourites of the Alien series has been part 3 and this, and I'd definitely rewatch those two. This was made in 1997, surely it's time to revisit it? Would Sigourney Weaver come back now? I doubt it! It's a very open ending as well, which left me not feeling empty, but relatively satisfied. It definitely rounds off the series nicely.

$review_text.: Anthony Hopkins stars as Charles in 1997's "The Edge", a sad, lifeless billionaire who has accumulated a vast store of mostly useless facts. Because of his great wealth he's unsure if people are honestly interested in him as a friend or just want his money. His much younger, model wife (Elle Macpherson) treats him more as a teddy bear than a romantic lover. He wonders if she's having an affair with her photographer Bob (Alec Baldwin).Charles gets stranded in the Northewest wilderness and is forced to confront three types of nature: First, he must contend with wilderness nature itself (the movie was filmed in breath-taking Alberta and British Columbia). Secondly, he comes face to face (literally) with a fierce Kodiak bear. Thirdly, he must confront human nature in the ugly form of arrongance, envy, malice, greed, lust and murder.Unexpectedly, as Charles confronts these three challenges he starts to blossom and fully come ALIVE, perhaps for the first time in decades. His colossal store of mostly worthless knowledge actually becomes useful.There are a couple "Yeah, right" Hollywood implausibilities -- for instance, the bear shaking the tree as the guys cross the river (an homage to King Kong) -- but, for the most part, the story plays out realistically."The Edge" addresses many powerful and worthy themes including Rebirth & renewal, confronting & overcoming incredible challenges, and, perhaps most potent of all, the power of repentance and triumphing over evil through goodwill & forgiveness.*** SPOILER ALERT *** Don't read the next paragraph if you haven't seen the movieSome may scoff at that last one but, after Charles gains the upperhand over Bob at the end, Bob sincerely repents of his wicked deeds before he ultimately dies (the 'wicked deeds' being his intention to kill Charles for his wife & wealth). At the end Charles refuses to say anything bad about Bob, even though he clearly has the right to; all he states is that Bob died saving his life. Why did he say this? Why didn't he lambaste him for being a murderous, greedy, adulterous scumbag? Perhaps not only because Charles accepted his repentance and FORGAVE him, but also because he realized that ALL OF US are screw-ups to some degree. We all have a dark, carnal side to our psyche, Bob simply made the mistake of going over THE EDGE; yet, in the end, he realized this and was truly sorry for it. What an amazing story about the power of repentance and forgiveness!*** END SPOILER ***These descriptions of the film's profundities are feeble at best; there's so much more I'd like to comment on but mere words won't do it justice. Discover for yourself. This is definitely a movie worthy of repeat viewings.BOTTOM LINE: If all you want out of "The Edge" is a great adventure/survival story with spectacular scenery, you'll definitely get it, yet it profoundly (and unexpectedly) offers so much more. I'm a pretty masculine dude but the last time I saw this film I was so affected that I broke down at the end.The next day I saw the Peter Jackson "King Kong" flick, which is essentially another adventure/survival yarn albeit with a giant gorilla and dinosaurs instead of a bear. Compared to "The Edge" Jackson's "King Kong" is a laughable $200 million Road Runner cartoon."The Edge" ranks with my all-time favorite films. 'Nuff said.

Its larger-than-life allure results from a seamless blending of elements: Pschodrama, Action, Suspense and Mystery, all built on intricate storytelling, a dynamic screenplay and taught direction, by Bryan Singer. The aforementioned are all bolstered by credible in-depth character development, brought to life by an outstanding cast, who flesh out each role to chilling near perfection. (Kevin Spacey, seen here before most people would have recognized his name, received an Oscar for his &quot;supporting&quot; role!)But let's not get sidetracked. More than anything else,&quot;SUSPECTS&quot; is about the unparalleled unsettling reaction you get from  viewing it! From the first scene to the end credits, it gets a headlock on your psyche, while sending the pit of your stomach into endless free fall! The only way to illustrate this, without giving away any key elements of the film, is a detailed look at the opening scene....a peerless example of instant timeless classic film noir.On a boat, docked in San Pedro Harbor, the dying sole-survivor of an apparently devastating bloodbath shootout painfully ignites a thin trail of gasoline. His obvious intention: Destroy EVERYTHING...himself included! From a deck higher up, an unseen someone pisses out the trail of flames. The shadowy figure walks down the stairs with an unhurried beliberation and saunters over to the agonizing man he has just saved. They exchange somewhat forced greetings and a few disjointed words of banter.Without warning, the intruder firmly raises a pistol, his unblinking gaze reflected in eyes locked in contact with his own. Unhesitatingly, he fires two consecutive shots. A brief pause of contemplation ends when he casually lights a cigarette, stategically dropping his lighter to rekindle the liquid fuse, and then beats a hasty off-board retreat.What better way to introduce a character whose twisted iron resolve is so perverse, so deranged, that he saves a doomed man seconds before certain death, solely for the unmititgated pleasure derived from looking him squarely in the eye, his victim looking right back, while pulling the trigger himself. Without uttering a syllable, his actions shout out,&quot;I piss on you and your puny existence!&quot; His victim's final moments are thusly converted into a living/dying testimony, clearly demonstrating who it is that decides the particulars of when and how he will die!&quot;SUSPECTS&quot; has been severely critiqued by a vocal minority (to paraphrase another Amazon reviewer) for not knowing the difference between a plot twist and a non sequitur. With all due respect to the reviewer, who painstakingly highlighted the difference for us, perhaps a careful second viewing would shed some light on the source of this common confusion. After watching  &quot;SUSPECTS&quot; four times making every effort to employ my most discerning eye, I am convinced the true genius of the movie hinges on this particular point!Let me underscore my unequivocal recommendation of this film with  a special note to those of you who avoid the Action or Suspense genre becuase of your distaste of the excessive violence that generally characterizes them. Well, THIS IS NO JOHN WOO FILM! A lot of the scenes are done in the &quot;Old School&quot; style, where the violence is kept off-screen. Although there is considerable TALK in &quot;SUSPECTS&quot; about some of the most dastardly deeds imaginable, virtually none of this is graphically portrayed. So, PLEASE, if you have not seen it yet, because of this reason, I urge you to make an exception in this case...GET IT AND SEE IT!

$REVIEW.: Chicago is a well- made musical production that tells the story of several vaudeville ladies in 1920's Chicago who compete for fame and fortune and are willing to sacrifice their reputations, sleep with different men, kill a few people, etc., to advance their careers. This movie was award with the Best Picture Oscar for 2002 and after watching it a couple of times, it is easy to see why it was considered for this prestigious award. The story presented in this musical is pretty good and it is packed with an all- star cast that includes performers like Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta- Jones, Richard Gere, and Queen Latifa. With a combination of talent like that, a film has a good chance for success. And Chicago certainly does succeed on most levels with many excellent song and dance scenes and strong directing from Rob Marshall.What makes a musical memorable is, of course, the music itself; in particular, the catchiness of the tunes, the presentation of the songs, and the integration of the songs within the context of the film. Among the many songs in this musical (about 18 of them), some of them are certainly better than others with the standouts being "I Move On", "All I Care About", and "All that Jazz". Many of the others are only average and I have already forgotten most of them- even after watching the movie two times. The way the songs are inserted into the movie, however, is very good and Rob Marshall deserves credit for timing the presentation of these tunes but even more impressive than the timing is the performances themselves. The dance scenes are hot, with Catherine Zeta- Jones and Renee Zellweger leading the way. Dozens of hot female bodies twist and turn to the music, making you quickly forget about quality of the songs themselves.As far as the story goes, it isn't the greatest I have ever seen in a movie (musical or otherwise) but it is still pretty good. What I like best about it is the character development and the progression of the lead character, Roxie Hart, from down- and- out vaudeville wannabe to media darling and ultimately back to where she started. It is interesting to watch as Renee Zellweger's character goes from a sexually dissatisfied woman married to a very homely looking man to a murderess. She is concerned at first that she will spend her life behind bars for killing the man she was having an affair with. Then, realizing her media star power as a woman who shot and killed a man, she forgets about the murder and lavishes in the attention, only to see the spotlight ultimately shift to another person who has an even greater story to tell.All of the performances in this movie are noteworthy and it is important to point out that Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta- Jones, Renee Zellweger, and the others perform the song and dance routines themselves. There is no lip- syncing or dubbed music here. The star performers prove they have earned their celebrity status by performing their own parts. Each of them is very good in their roles, especially Zellweger as the main character and John Reilly as her plain- looking, plain- spoken husband.Overall, Chicago is a good musical with some hot dance scenes, good songs, and star performances all around. The movie ultimately looks slightly better then it sounds because not all of the songs are very memorable. But it is still a very good Hollywood musical and the first of its genre to win the Best Picture award in a more than thirty years.

$review_text.: From Quincy Jones' score to Haskell Wexler's cinematography "In the Heat of the Night" is worthy of inclusion on anyone's top ten films list.But as ground breaking as the film was on the subject of 1967 race relations, the most amazing thing is how well it has held up almost 40 years later. I think it rings so true because of way they elected to play several key scenes.Watch for the carefully orchestrated scene between Mrs. Colbert (Lee Grant) and Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) when alone in the chief's office early in the film. He has just told her that her husband has been murdered and she recoils from his first two attempts to comfort her. Given the upfront racism exhibited in the film up to that point, you assume that it is more of the same. But this is Mrs. Colbert's first scene and when she does not rebuff his third attempt to comfort her you realize that she is completely unaware of his race, she is just devastated by what he has told her and would have rebuffed anyone as she struggled to accept what she has just learned. The attentive viewer realizes that their own prejudice, kindled by what they have seen up to that point in the film, caused them to jump to the wrong conclusion about her character's motivation.Then watch for the evolving attitude of Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) toward Tibbs. Early on he comes to professionally respect him (as he respects the town's black mechanic), then he comes to respect Tibbs as a man when he slaps Endicott (something no other man-black or white-would dare), and finally he comes to respect him as a human being when Tibbs reveals a lust to take Endicott down. The irony being that it is finding Tibbs capable of a higher level human weakness (not a strength) that opens Gillespie's eyes to the fallacy of racism.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

$review_text.: I find it difficult to believe that not one person has written a review for this movie. So I shall try to do my very best. This movie simply oozes charm. I bought it on a lark, and not a few positive words from others. And well, because Audrey Tautou looks cute on the cover. I'd seen a few bits of it here and there, and decided why not. I am glad that I did too, because it's marvelous.This is a quirky movie, and in that way that we Americans will never be able to reproduce. All we do is remake them, and they're typically saccharine sweet at best. We seem to excel at war movies, and depressing stories that crush the spirit of the viewer. And those are good too, but there's only so much one can take before they need a movie like this to soothe their soul. And here we have the French to thank for something other than blowing up a greenpeace ship. Not that I don't whole-heartedly appreciate that.The story is about a girl who spent her childhood starved of affection from her neurotic, but well meaning parents. Mom dies in a bizarre suicide attempt by a Quebec exchange student involving Notre Dame, gravity, and a little bit of screaming. It has almost no bearing on the plot other than to dispose of the mother, and thus add a dimension of grief to the father, who builds her a shrine of odds and ends; to include a (seemingly) nomadic garden gnome. She works at a caf&eacute; with more "interesting" people, who have their own little stories, but they are little indeed. She's unlucky in love, thus far, and in life she's so shy that her world consists of working, visiting her bereaved father, and isolating herself in her apartment, where she spies on a curious neighbor who has painted the same Renoir every year for the last twenty years. He also suffers from a genetic condition that predisposes him to suffering broken bones with great ease. Similar to Samuel L's character in that horrible movie Unbreakable, but here it's actually believable.  Everything changes when she hears on the TV that Princess Di has been killed, thus she drops the lid from the bottle in her hand, thus it rolls off and knocks loose a wall tile in her bathroom (how's that for contrived?). Hidden behind is a dust covered rusty tin with some small child's treasures concealed within. She decides to reunite the tin with it's now quite grown up owner, and if she is successful, she will spend the rest of her life trying to reunite other miserable people with some form happiness. It sounds sweet, but only through some small cleverness on the part of the writer can it possibly succeed. Thankfully, it does, begging me to wonder if this movie could possibly ever been made in the States...All of this takes place, and more, with the backdrop of a Paris that does not really exist. The colours are bright, the streets clean, the people amiable. But the photography is outstanding, and helps the movie along in that effortless way we all like to see. Amelie is not all sweet though, as she sees fit to avenge the small crimes of one of the movies myriad of characters. It's all quite harmless, as is the movie, which makes it such a delight to watch. Like eating tiramisu, in a hot bath (I guess). This is definitely a good movie for guys to rent if their lady is coming over, and should yield some form of passion (though I take no responsibility for that comment). Excellent movie for anyone not afraid to read subtitles.

No matter how hard she tries, she comes across as sweet in some way. Kevin Spacey was right in his element as the psycho.  I rememeber when he first started off as a kingpin in the series "Wiseguy" with Ken Wahl. He was an excellent bad guy and that's what gave the movie the punch it did have.  With all the talent in this movie, it was not really funny.  I can't explain why.  Oh, I know, it was the guy who kept messing things up for the trio.  Better writing would have helped the movie.

$review_text.: There's nothing wrong with the quality of these DVDs, they feature the same episodes we know and love, however, there are some things that could have been improved. Firstly, there is no "play all" option, which would have been a nice feature. Also, when watching on a computer you can't skip and reverse by clicking on the progress bar, you actually have to fast forward and rewind using the extremely slow arrows. This makes finding specific scenes or moments in the episode more difficult than it needs to be. I've tried doing this in several programs and on more than one computer, but I apologize if this is something that works for others.Especially troubling is the fact that regularly aired episodes are listed as 'Special Features'. These are listed on the box as "Behind the Scenes" and "Viewer Faq", which makes one think these are things we haven't seen before. If it's an episode that is played regularly, it's not a Special Feature. The music video featured on the DVD was also shown on TV. This wouldn't have deterred me from purchasing these DVDs, but I find the misadvertising annoying.If you love this show, these DVDs are still great!

$REVIEW.: There is a long tradition of peasant revolt and the legends of Robin Hood against the Sheriff of Nottingham. After the Civil War the James and Younger gangs, former Confederate soldiers, gained sympathy as fighting against the Northern railroads. ["Unhappy are the people who have no heroes."] But these gangs were only in it for the money. So this film takes two small-town robbers from the 1930s and presents them as some sort of heroes. Dying young is a tragedy for most people.The film starts out in 1931 with Clyde Barrow, just out of prison for armed robbery, beginning his short and violent life as a bank robber. He meets Bonnie Parker, a waitress who seeks to make a career change. She is neither the first nor the last to make an unwise decision. Their first bank job is a bust; it failed weeks ago! The grocery store robbery also fails. They locate a young man who knows cars to be the wheel man and mechanic. [Can crooks recognize each other by some code?] The next robbery results in a murder. [Would an unarmed man jump on the running board?] The film says Clyde has a performance problem, as if this is supposed to be symbolism. Next Clyde's brother Buck and his wife join the gang. But Blanche is kept in the dark. Clyde also wants to take photographs.[More symbolism?]A grocery delivery boy seems to take an interest in their cabin. But they suspect nothing until the police show up. There is a shoot-out, and they manage to escape. [Did motor courts have a bad reputation?] A Texas Ranger meets them and is captured, they photograph and release him. There is a conflict over splitting the loot. Next they hijack a car, and capture the couple who chased them. When they find the man is a mortician, they dump them. [More symbolism?] There is a family reunion, as if to suggest approval of their illegal activities [it is a movie].But somebody notices something, and the police track them down. A night-time shoot-out follows, the Barrow gang make an escape. Some are wounded. They stop for a rest, but their pursuers attack them. Their luck is running low. While recovering, Clyde shows emotion that suggests a mental problem. They wonder about their future; Clyde explains what he would do different! On the way back from town they stop where a truck has pulled over for a flat tire. But it is a trap, and "it was death for Bonnie and Clyde". This film reminds me of G.B. Shaw's comments that you can show any immorality in a play as long as the person dies at the end. [Was this a criticism of Shakespeare's "Macbeth"?] This well finished film is much better than its subject.

$REVIEW.: I picked Book of Shadows: Blair Witch Project 2 movie up at the rental store, expecting absolutely nothing except a bad flick that might have a few good moments.  I cannot believe how well-done this movie is, how it exceeded my expectations in every way.  The acting is especially solid,  by characters that you really care about.The original Blair Witch Project was spoiled by all the hype as "the scariest movie of all time," and I frequently thought how disappointed I was with it.  This movie makes it all better.The story starts out fairly innocuous, with folks who loved the original movie pouring into the town where the students vanished.  An enterprising, young local man is making money selling all kinds of Blair Witch souvenirs on E-Bay.  He takes a group of four on his first guided tour of the site, a camping trip in the woods.  A practicing Wiccan, a Goth girl, and a couple conducting serious research.  As the movie unfolds, it becomes more intricate and you are soon enmeshed in a terrifying situation.  Thank you to the producers and director for finally delivering some solid horror from this franchise.The soundtrack is excellent, featuring Marilyn Manson and System of a Down.

$REVIEW.: 4stars ONLY because something was missing and it was in the script; the actors were unbelievably normal and natural and wonderfully real

Bravo to all the actors, including Anniston!!!I CAME ONLINE TO DO RESEARCH regarding this "genre" and I have "Back-Up Plan" on my list, but not, "Valentine's Day," ...that's a different genre, while, I do have "The Kids ARe Alright" written in the margin as a note, which is just about the same genre here but some people may argue that same-sex "marriage" is not the same thing as: "I Want A Baby--I'll Worry About A Partner Later."Selfish?  That's written with a question mark as a note

 50-years ago, it was selfish; today it is something else


 But, the point is: A child is deliberately created under less-than "ideal" circumstances..


and it appears to be done like a game,(at best) a creation, like a breeding game except that people are very serious and think they are doing ALL the right things by crossing rules like they cross sexual acts back and forth.The point is: The views we hold today about all of this is our "culture"

 We are anthropods with this "creative" culture
 Once women died (bled to death), were killed (stoned) and all sorts of nasty stuff about the issues and dynamics covered in "SWITCH", which we air as a comedy today.Now who wants to view this movie and its context with seriousness...as we enter even more of this cultural age????  No one


 Just like I thought
 We want to see delightful characters that make us laugh in this comedy

We didn't pay our money for a thick, murky, drama but that's just what it is but don't tell anybody
 Let them decide for themselves if this makes "sense" for good American living now and in the future.There is another movie that is old (???) and I believe Robert Duvall is a husband and Faye Dunaway is a wife, dressed in blue, I remember


I'm looking for that movie, can't remember its name

It's about "noble" women who want children but they do not want the children to come out of their bodies so they lie on the bed and have a young surrogate sit in front of them and they both lie back as the husband comes to have sex with the surrogate to get her pregnant but when the baby is born the noble woman takes the baby as her own
***THE SOCIETY DESCRIBED IN THE MOVIE IS NOT A FREE SOCIETY
 THE SURROGATE DOES NOT HAVE A CHOICE

After a few minutes I recognized the similarity to the cartoons I watched as a child (mediocre animation, lack of depth in plot or character).  The melodies may be great, and there may be a moral that makes Thumbelina appropriate watching for a much younger age group, but to keep me entertained, the film must be at least as edgy as a Three Stooges episode.

Their strategies ranged from military action to diplomacy, spirituality, or even legal and political means

The stories of these individual leaders span four hundred years; collectively, they give a portrait of an oft-overlooked yet crucial side of American history, and carry the highest recommendation for public library as well as home DVD collections
Special features include behind-the-scenes footage, a thirty-minute preview film, materials for educators and librarians, four ReelNative films of Native Americans sharing their personal stories, and three Native Now films about modern-day issues facing Native Americans


7 hours.

$REVIEW.: I collect the winners of the "Best Picture" category and was surprised to see this as a winner. The film was different but not exciting and nor did it draw me under suspense. The humor in the film was typical of Woody Allen but to me really dry. If you are a Woody Allen fan, you will enjoy this transfer onto Blu-ray as it was cleanly done.

$review_text.: Danny Boyle's apocalyptic 28 Days Later is a very solid horror film.  The first two acts are particularly exciting.  Part tension and part excitement, the first half with keep you engaged.  But around the time the third half rolls around, you won't know what hit you.The ending is just as interesting.  It's a very good movie with a few misteps but enjoyable nonetheless.The DVD features a commentary, deleted scenes, two alternate endings (one filmed, one storyboard), and and some featurettes.Quite an interesting take on the horror genre.Recommended.

$review_text.: I didn't know what to expect when I went to see "Kung Fu Hustle" in theaters but I'm a big fan of Chinese foreign films and needless to say it exceeded all expectations. It's a mobster movie like you've never seen before set around the 1930s. The Axe Gang wear nice, fancy black suits, and after killing some apparent foes in the beginning of the movie the credits show flashes of the "tough" gangsters doing a strange sort of dance in unison I couldn't help but chuckle at with unparalleled delight. At that point I knew this was going to be an interesting film and I was absolutely right. Legends with inhuman powers arise from the unlikeliest of people, crushing the Axe Gang's superiority and pride of being the "bad-asses" you should fear for your life from. They in turn hire countless assassins to wipe out an entire village but their attempts prove futile as the population contains more than just weak farmers and housekeepers... I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of "Kung Fu Hustle" (think Looney Toons meets Kill Bill) and recommend it to anyone who looks for odd, quirky movies that are also smart and creative, yet totally out there. The subtitles didn't even bother me as I find that most films in Chinese sound much better in the original language verses being horribly dubbed in English (ie-House Of Flying Daggers).

$REVIEW.: (note - I did not see the original when broadcasted on TV, so I can only review this "edited" version).Into the West is both excellent and poor at the same time. For what it covers in detail during the 19th century, it is commendable. The expansion of our nation westward was such a major undertaking for those who were a part of that time - just as scary as those who left their homelands on the other side of the Atlantic to come to the New World.This set shows the harrowing experiences of the travelers pretty accurately: fighting the weather (no, it wasn't always bright and sunny on the wagon trail), death from accidents and disease - the horrible scenes of an amputation is as real as it gets, as well as the length of time it took to move the long distance, which created high tensions between the folks. Previous movies of westward expansion rarely, if ever, show this.The series also shows the atrocities the American government bestowed upon the Indian. The blatant lies, and purposeful obliteration of the tribes, the prejudices toward the Indian race. And the constant movement of whole villages of the natives for the various reasoning given at the time (can anybody say "poletown?" Google it to see what I mean).And, as far as I can tell, the truly heartbreaking massacre at Wounded knee - a true low point in American history if there ever was one.Now comes my disappointments in this set.Similar to Dances With Wolves, Into The West's other purpose seems to be to make the white race as a whole out to be a bunch of evil devils. Throughout this movie whites are dogged - even by their own in many cases. It shows whites killing Indians out of fear constantly, but does it show the reverse - Indians killing whites for the same reasons? Very little. And when it is showed, it's shown in a manner where the viewer can accept the reasoning behind the murders. Did you not feel the young bugler's death was honored and justified? Did you not feel pride for the young Indian boy when he killed him, then did not scalp him because the bugler fought bravely? That was sickening!There is another scene where Margaret tells the Cheyenne Chief what the magic box is - "camera." How is the response? The chief comments on the language the white race uses, how it is not as "musical" as the Indian tongue. What is that? Blatant racism, if you ask me. Putting down a race because of their English language?Into the West also rarely shows most white families as close-knit, instead showing constantly fighting amongst themselves - even killing each other. Of course, if one took this movie as absolute truth, one would think the Indians never fought or killed each other. They only lived in peace.Truth be known, they fought and killed every bit as much as any other race. Of course, it is not politically correct to say that, but to believe otherwise is not accepting the whole truth.Oh, and by the way, the tribes were very protective of "their land" as well. This set shows that in an inconspicuous manner, but it's there.Killing, war, hatred, rape, all happened in all races.While watching this set I have pointed out the fabrications on both sides of the fence, how this set can never truly be considered THE TRUTH because of the political correctness.I am still waiting for the day when the whole honest truth is shown. It's written that this version is for classroom use. The poor white kids, unfortunately, will leave believing their race is the scourge of the nation. And that is as big of a shame as any form of racism out there.(Postscript: To the reviewer who made a personal attack on me for my review - I have done my research, and I will not accept what you insist as being "fact" because you insist it's so. I have read many many books and articles about the plight of the American Indian as well as the hardships and murder of the white settlers. There are two sides to every story. And that IS a fact. Re-read my review...did I not speak of the attrocities the U.S. government bestowed upon the Indians? I simply stated that this series, instead of showing facts on all sides, was a one-sided anti-European piece of politically correct propoganda that is being peddled to school aged kids as being historically accurate. And, yes, that is racism. Or do you believe that racism is a one street with white folks at one end and all other races at the other?)

$review_text.: &quot;Star Trek-Voyager&quot; is the fourth series in the ever-lasting sci-fi franchise, and it's like &quot;Lost In Space&quot;, but with a Federation crew, and they have definitely gone where no man has gone before.As Captain Kathryn Janeway, Kate Mulgrew surely commands respect as she and her crew are blasted 70,000 light years away from home by some array called the 'Caretaker'.  The crew itself is quite diverse and interesting, especially Chakotay (Robert Beltran), Tuvok (Tim Russ), Tom Paris (Robert Duncan MacNeill), and B'elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson).  I'm not very happy with Neelix (Ethan Phillips).  I stick with the Doctor (Robert Picardo) as the most fascinating comic relief in the show.&quot;Voyager&quot; might have gone through a bumpy start with critics and fans alike, but I believe that this pilot episode delivers the goods, and it's better than the one from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;.

$review_text.: The movie: I saw this one in its initial release
Our entire grade school walked to our local (single-screen) movie theater to see it on a field trip and loved it! This was back in the golden era of the Sunday comic strips when each installment of Hal Foster's strip was eagerly awaited by the nation at large
Foster is reported to have been disappointed by the film


The film took some liberties but overall remains true to the spirit of the original Foster characters and stories


Modern day audiences are used to a different style of actors and action and may find themselves restless


Director Henry Hathaway keeps things moving
Franz Waxman's score is first rate! -- I wish it was presented on its own isolated track

The entire cast is quite good with James Mason the standout actor here

Whether deliberate or not, there is some overacting in the lead characters and some of the wigs are a bit much but all is forgiven as the story moves forward nicely

This film delivers the goods on its own terms


For what it is, it's quite good -- fun and enjoyable for the whole family.The disc: This Eureaka Blu-ray release is region free


The Blu-ray video and audio quality varies but mostly very good


*Way far better* than the the previous DVD release and leaves both LaserDisc and VHS releases in the dark ages
Is it perfect? Not by a long shot

I read somewhere, but cannot substantiate, that this is the first CinemaScope (widescreen) film that went into production -- "The Robe", a more prestigious production, was released first

Budget and film stock were not the greatest in the early Fox widescreen 1950s

Stereophonic sound was still new in theaters

The sound stage here is all up front with nice directional touches


This film *needs* and *deserves* a full restoration

Fox released a DVD long after that format's inception


I only hope they'll get around to a full restoration and studio Blu-ray release much sooner
Until then, this is the best "Prince Valiant" has looked and sounded on home video

A keeper.The extras: Well, aside from a trailer, nada


Darn.Although it's far from being the best film ever made, it's a very enjoyable romp and I am *delighted* to have it in my modest collection.

He does not star as the lead but is great as a supporting character in all 3 movies.And Now the Screaming Starts is my favorite and well worth watching the commentary is excellent.Asylum is the next best and is an anthology it has several stories and Cushing gives a fine performance.Last on is the Beast Must Die

This is the weakest but still has some good moments
It is also fun to watch all those early 70'sstyles and one has to watch for a young Micheal Gambon in an early role.The stories are entertaining and the acting is uniformly top notch


And watching Peter Cushing in anything is worth it.

$REVIEW.: While "Iron Sky" is certainly a much better movie thanNazis at the Center of the Earth, it is only partially successful as a truly watchable "Grade B" Sci-Fi.No plot spoilers from me: The movie opens with the USA's less than triumphant return to the moon as part of campaign stunt for a "Sarah Palin" type president trying to get reelected for a second term
The Astronaut she chose to the lead the mission to the Dark Side of the Moon is a black model, with the mission motto, "Black to the Moon..


Yes we can." Imagine the surprise when they find a moon base populated by..

Nazis! Form there we are treated to fairly decent acting, special effects ranging from laughable to actually very good, a strong anti-American message (unnecessarily offensive in a few places), awkward race stereotyping, and some pretty good spoofing of Sci-Fi/Film classics.It did take me three attempts to get all the way through the movie so it was far from riveting, but it did have a few worthwhile scenes for the "bad movie" lover to enjoy.CFH

$REVIEW.: By 1951 Doris Day had become one of the most valuable assets at Warner Brothers. She was their number one female box-office draw and as a follow-up to her hugely popular 1950 musical with Gordon MacRae, &quot;Tea for Two&quot; the pair were teamed up again (their 3rd teaming in fact) in the technicolor &quot;On Moonlight Bay&quot;.Loosely based on the &quot;Penrod&quot; tales by Booth Tarkington, &quot;Bay&quot; is a nostalgic, lovingly created look at small town Americana, a world that might not have existed quite as it is depicted but a place we'd like to believe really was.Doris Day is a tomboy, more at home on the baseball field or fixing a car than in a dress.  The arrival of the boy next door changes some of that, though not all. Her precocious brother Wesley is the devil incarnate.  Mom and Dad spend a lot of time scratching their heads in bemused wonderment at their youngsters antics, and the family maid is erascible but likeable. It's all tied up with gorgeous technicolor photography and a lot of lovely music.Some critics have carped that it's Warners version of &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; but &quot;On Moonlight Bay&quot; can stand on its own merits thanks to a great cast and some genuinely sweet and funny moments.Doris is perfect as Marjorie, effectively balancing the tomboy and blossoming young lady elements of her character and singing in that gorgeous voice that is distinctly her own.  Gordon MacRae is stalwart as the object of her affection and it's obvious that the two have a genuine feeling for one another.  They remained good friends until his untimely passing.  Their rendition of &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot; is outstanding.It's easy to believe that the cast is really a family.  Leon Ames and Rosemary DeCamp as the parents are warmly winning. In 1984 I had the pleasure of joining Miss DeCamp and her husband, a retired California Judge at an awards dinner and we talked about this film among others and she glowed as she discussed the on-set atmosphere and interactions of the cast.Bill Gray (of &quot;Father Knows best&quot; fame) is delightful and funny as Wesley, and who could have played the family maid better than Mary Wickes. This was the 1st of 4 on-screen roles opposite Day who was a lifelong friend.  In addition Wickes did a very funny guest shot on Day's CBS Television series in 1969.&quot;On Moonlight Bay&quot; was such a huge success for Warners that two years later they reteamed most of the cast for an equally popular sequel, &quot;By the Light of the Silvery Moon&quot;.Take a sail on Moonlight Bay and you'll be surprised at how much you enjoy the trip.

$REVIEW.: John Wells (Shameless, The Company Men) directed this well craft interpersonal drama of real characters and a very real story about a family intertwining their lives back together after a serious tragedy


Taken from an original screenplay by Tracey Letts (Killer Joe) based on his stage play, &#8220;August: Osage County&#8221; is something everyone should see.Another tour-de-force performance by Meryl Streep (Doubt, The Hours) once again as she proves she has more layers and colors in her performances and just when you thought you&#8217;ve seen her do it all, she&#8217;s back again on screen doing something new and fresh

As the Matriarch of the family coming together for her husband&#8217;s death, Meryl&#8217;s character is struggling with drug addiction, cancer and all with the moral fiber of a cotton ball


Her oldest, and most bitter daughter, is poignantly played by Julia Roberts (Peter Pan, Pretty Women)

Julia and Meryl have some amazing scenes together and watching them fight as mother and daughter is electrifying!Julia also has some incredibly real and funny, but heartbreaking, family issues/scenes with her husband played dutifully by Ewan McGregor (Big Fish, Moulin Rouge)


His innocents and passion are clearly what sharpen both the relationship between him and Julia but also their daughter played by Abigale Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine, Signs).Now another stand out and amazing performance comes from Chris Cooper (The Muppets, American Beauty) as the husband of Margot Martindale (The Millers, Million Dollar Baby) and the father of Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek: Into Darkness, Sherlock)

Chris has one of the most amazing scenes defending his son from Margot and it will literally lift your spirits and make you angry at the same time


Benedict does some amazing shy and persecuted acting with an emotional layer I have never seen him do before

They all are really amazing.Julianne Nicholson (The Red Road, Boardwalk Empire) plays the middle sister with a very private secret that will literally shake the family tree apart (leaf by leaf) once it&#8217;s revealed
Her sister, and the youngest of the three girls is played by Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, What&#8217;s Eating Gilbert Grape) who is more than a little &#8216;out of it&#8217; as well as introducing her new (much older) fianc&eacute; to the family who is played by Dermot Mulroney (My Best Friend&#8217;s Wedding, Big Miracle).By the way, Meryl&#8217;s husband, although a small role, was subtly, yet masterfully played by Sam Sheppard (Simpatico, Fool For Love)

He is the catalyst for many events in this film.This movie was very real and visceral in all the performances but the amazing dynamics of Meryl, Julia and Chris are just what set this family film on its ear
This film has so much real dialogue and actions, that if you are like most of us, you will literally feel like you are watching your own dysfunctional family right on the screen
&#8220;August: Osage County&#8221; is an amazing film

$review_text.: This 1938 film stars Shirley Temple and veteran song-and-dance man George Murphy, a future U.S. Senator from California, who team up to save an unemployed vaudeville troupe (including the legendary Jimmy Durante, who dances with Shirley in one sequence) from eviction from the Hotel Variety, which is partially owned by Murphy's character's aunt.  The film is fast-paced and features two great Temple-Murphy dance numbers:  "We Should Be Together," and the title track, which is set in a courtroom, where the vaudevillians finally win their case.  Like most of the Shirley Temple DVDs, there are black-and-white and colorized versions of the film, English and Spanish audio and subtitles, a fake stereo soundtrack, and theatrical trailers and newsreel footage.  The trailer for this film, however, was partially destroyed and features only music; there are no title graphics or narration.A very entertaining film indeed; Shirley proved she could dance with anyone.

$REVIEW.: This American re-edit of the 1954 film Gojira features Raymond Burr as Steve Martin, an American reporter in Japan.Burr's  character narrates this &#34;monster movie&#34; in English along with several Japanese-American actors in footage shot in the U.S. and inserted into the original film. The American version is still very entertaining and is more like the typical radio-active giant monster films produced in the U.S.. The original film Gojira is a much darker film than the U.S. re-edit. Gojira is a anti-Nuke filmwith more people dying from Gojira's radio-active breath in scenes deleted to make room for the Burr footage. The original film deals with weather an ultimate weapon should ever be used, and is also well worth checking out.

$REVIEW.: This is a great DVD!  I had never seen the bulk of these Disney classics, and the few I remember I last saw decades ago on &quot;Wonderful World of Disney.&quot;  Wow!  Some of the finest animation I have seen.In an interview on this DVD, Disney says that the Silly Symphonies were an arena for animators to experiment, without the financial risks of a feature length animated film.  This format was a fertile field for the imagination.  Artists who are free to take risks tend to produce more stunning work.  &quot;Wynken, Blynken and Nod&quot; is a really beautiful cartoon that I had never seen before.  It it packed with vivid colors and dynamic animation.  The cloud men are impressive.  &quot;Water Babies&quot; is very pretty and very funny.  Each cartoon is a classic.I mainly wanted this collection for &quot;The Old Mill&quot; and &quot;Skeleton Dance.&quot;  Those did not disappoint.  I had not seen &quot;The Old Mill&quot; for years and it is as dramatic and perfect as I remember.  &quot;Skeleton Dance&quot; is a spooky treat.  &quot;Wise Little Hen,&quot;  the first Donald Duck cartoon, was an unexpected delight.  I can see why the character took off.There are some complaints about this DVD.  Too many of the Leonard Maltin picks are duplicated elsewhere on the disk.  They could have used the room to put in some more cartoons.  The &quot;Easter eggs&quot; are easy to find, but may confuse people.  Some older cartoons are scratchy.  However, there is so much delight in the cartoons themselves, I don't mind the minor flaws.  I'll say it again. This is a great DVD!

$review_text.: This movie was an unexpected delight! I had not read the book, so I had no preconceived notions, but it was a wonderful plot and well acted. I think all couples who are engaged or thinking about getting engaged should watch this movie (not necessarily together). It gives one a lot to think about prior to getting married. The lead character, Fanny Price, is a very wise young woman who sees more than many others of her age and time. What fun to find Hugh Bonneville (Sir Grantham of "Downton Abbey") buried in a supporting role in this 1999 movie. I found this film to be a combination of tragedy, romance, and comedy, particularly the latter in the way it was directed. It was time well spent!

$REVIEW.: A typically minimalist Allen DVD, but that's how it should be. It includes an original theatrical trailer (as they used to be made, not just clips of the film itself but a separate small original short).There is really no one good reason why this film is as funny as it is, but for some reason it works most of the time. Allen in his comedic heyday injected his own writing with Marx (both Karl and the brothers), Keatonesque physical comedy, and Catskills humor. The result is a mismash of intelligentsia revolutionary humor and pie-in-face (prunes, not cherry) comedy.Recommended for anyone not familiar with Allen. An early 70s effort with many cultural reference that may go over the head of the under 30 crowd.

$review_text.: This is my second Shippuden movie that I am frankly disappointed in. The fight scenes are weak, the plot is the weakest yet. Far weaker than even bonds. As a fan of Naurto I'm surprised at the people here saying "The best ever." Three fight scenes, total, that are longer than 20 seconds; And the plot? Really?Pro: Kakashi back story.Con: Everything else.This review will contain minor spoilers, please do not continue if this bothers you.The plot revolves around the abduction of ninja's from the various hidden villages, resulting in the threat of a 4th great war. The leaf village is implicated because the person who appears to have done this was once affiliated with them. Though he is never mentioned anywhere, his back story is that he was part of the same group as pervy sage etc. In fact, he was "Friends" with tsunade etc.Ignoring that weak plot point let's move to weak plot point 2. War is about to break out because this one ninja has proclaimed he wants to kill everyone, including the leaf village, but this apparently makes all other hidden villages think the leaf village is the bad guy for no apparent reason. All other villages prepare to attack the leaf, I mean only the sand village is ever shown but supposedly it's "all". Kakashi is taken. Everyone follows to save him. The bad guy absorbs chakra and all abilities used against him, meaning he can't be beat. Naruto beats him using an ability he just, for again no known reason, didn't use prior to this. For, again no known reason, the bad guy that can absorb ALL chakra, can't absorb this attack made of chakra. Literally as the ability is about to hit him, he simply states, "I can't absorb it...why?" Not nine tails chakra either, just regular Naruto blue. There is then a joke involving that Naruto and Kakashi may be a couple. The end of the movie.

$REVIEW.: I got this video today and couldn't wait to try it out! Workout 1 is 45 min, Workout 2 is 50 min (including warm-up and cool down). Unlike her previous workouts, there is a single, long circuit repeated twice. The moves are basically the same as her previous dvds, but with some moves combined. There are all new people (no Natalie. boo!). And there is a DJ-- not sure why. Overall, I really like these workouts. I've been waiting for her to come out with another dvd in which the workouts are more that 40 min. I'd say workouts 1 and 2 are similar in intensity, but workout 2 has more complicated moves.

 It not only gives insights into life in the cotton mills in England and how challenging those times were, but it shows the good and bad sides of all the characters
 You see them as more realistic people and shows how people can change given certain circumstances

Filmed in my native New Zealand by my favourite director Peter Jackson, Deal Alive (or Braindead as I always knew is as) is one of the funniest horror's I've ever seen.The much touted lawnmower scene really has to be seen to be believed, and I couldn't stop laughing through the kung-fu priest scene.Yes, it's pretty low-brow stuff but boy is it entertaining.Brilliant!

$review_text.: WWE has been doing a really good job with its DVD series, and this one stands out as exceptionally good.If you were a fan of professional wrestling before its days of self-acknowledged "sports entertainment"; if you remember when your friends all thought you were nuts, and when to root for the Magnificent Muraco at a live show was to risk your life; if you thought that "Hulkamania" was a huge step down for the sport and that Greg "The Hammer" Valentine was the prototypical role model; then there is no way you won't love this DVD.Perhaps most people will probably by it for the extras - historic matches such as the Sgt. Slaughter vs. Pat Patterson street fight, Big John Studd vs. Andre, Tito Santana vs. Greg Valentine for the IC belt (now THERE was a rivalry), and many others.  Additionally, some of the non-match footage - interviews, promos, and the like - will get you a little misty-eyed.  You'll see guys you never liked at the time (the late Junkyard Dog is an example in my case), but you'll realize how much they meant to the sport.But really, the induction ceremony is worthy of a DVD unto itself.  The tributes are as good as are the acceptance speeches.  Use the CHAPTERS option to skip the Pete Rose induction (now there's a situation that's embarrassing to both wrestling and baseball).  You could pretty much watch the rest at a sitting.This would probably be an interesting view of wrestling history for younger fans.  Old-timers shouldn't miss it.Great stuff.

$REVIEW.: Non-committal college student Nick wants to do one thing: prove he's smarter than anyone else.  To do that, he decides to stage the perfect mass murder.  See, the differences between mass murderers and serial killers is that serial killers, on occasion, get away with it.  With several examples at hand, including Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, Nick's professor, Hal, insists mass murderers never get away with the deed.  So Nick decides to be the first.  To carry out his plan, he arranges a party in his uncle's luxurious Las Vegas apartment, inviting his closest friends under the guise of a goodbye party for his best friend Jimmy who is about to head off for six months.One by one, throughout the night, Nick manages to, quietly and with no bloodshed, execute his plan and his friends.  Stealing from classics like Hitchcock's ROPE and Agatha Christie's TEN LITTLE INDIANS, Mark Anthony Galluzzo's RSVP is fun to watch despite its flaws.For me, those flaws started with the script which doesn't sound anything at all like how any of the people I have EVER encountered in my life, including the intellectuals, talk, especially when the characters get on a roll concerning the nature of serial killers and man in general.Second is the acting.  Jason Mewes plays Terry, who is basically Jason Mewes under a different name, and he can't even manage to pull off playing himself convincingly.  Glenn Quinn, who spent many many years covering up his Irish accent, keeps slipping in and out of it so often it took me half the movie to realize he was even playing Irish.  I thought he was just having a particularly rough time handling his American accent.And Rick Otto as lead character Nick spent so much time looking like Ethan Hawke's black-haired cousin I was often pulled out of the movie by it.  I know that's not his fault, so I don't hold it against him.  I do, however, hold against him his affinity for overplaying the psycho when no one is watching.  I understand the movie is played for the most part as a black comedy, but let's not shatter the illusion with crazy eyes every single time no one is looking directly at the killer.In addition to Jason Mewes and Glenn Quinn, several other familiar faces show up, adding a certain amount of charm to this low budget movie out of nowhere.  Reno Wilson, Grace Zabriskie and Majandra Delfino all fall victim to Nick's master plan.RSVP is a fun movie despite a number of distracting flaws.  The dialogue really is hard to get past at times, and the acting is, depending on who's front and center, embarrassing, but overall I had a good time watching it.  I think it could have easily been cut by about 15-20 minutes, but that's really neither here nor there and the length certainly doesn't detract from the enjoyment.I like to think there was some point Galluzzo was trying to make with this movie, some statement about fame or something--there was a brief bit delivered by Prof. Evans (Quinn) about how musicians who only go into the business for fame are doing it wrong because he could make himself a household name by morning by simply killing everyone in the room, but the whole things seems to come out of nowhere and felt very out of place in that particular moment in the story--but if he did, I have a feeling he wasn't sure how to include it with any amount of subtlety.RSVP isn't perfect.  In fact, it probably shouldn't even work at all.  But there's something about it I liked anyway, enough to recommend it.  You might even want to watch it a few times just to pick up on some of the foreshadowing that should have been obvious from the start, but only came together in the end.  Overall this is a very flawed, but still very watchable, movie.

Well, that was then, this is now
The reality is that it's your basic monster B movie, not terrible, but it is from 1982 as far a "special effects" go


I'd go into this expecting little, and then you may be suprised
You know, it's so bad it's good kind of thing


Also, Q himself only gets about 2 minutes of screen time max, and even then he's no Godzilla

Basically it's something fun, and the obvious choice for renting movies beginning with the leter Q.

$REVIEW.: DARK BLUE stars Kurt Russell as Eldon Perry, a corrupt LA cop who is also pretty racist.  The movie is set in 1992, during the first Rodney King trial, and LA cops are feeling the brunt of civil rights complaints against them.  This situation doesn't deter Eldon, who continues to beat and kill suspects at will.  He also has to contend with an inexperienced partner (Scott Speedman) and a superior (Ving Rhames) who sees through him.DARK BLUE was directed by Ron Shelton, who has done some really nice work, such as White Men Can't Jump and Bull Durham.  Unfortunately, the direction is really poor here, and it looks and feels like a cable TV movie.  The plot is also pretty hackneyed and too similar to "Training Day" (which was written by one of the same screenwriters).The acting also is not very good, with some over-the-top performances from Ving Rhames and Brendan Gleeson.  Despite an ok performance from Kurt Russell, this movie sinks under unbelievable situations and an attempt to give each character a sub-plot.  None of the plot twists are surprising or satisfying.  Finally, the movie uses the LA riots as a clumsy plot twist, without exploring the important underlying issues of race.  Not recommended.

$REVIEW.: Produced by Frank Darabont and ER's Eriq La Salle. This film noir stars Val Kilmer as a tattooed dope fiend who may be a nark for the LAPD, but then again he might not be. Why should we care?As soon as Kilmer begins his opening narrative, you know you're not going to be seeing another SUNSET BLVD. THE SALTON SEA is stylishly shot; but then again, it wouldn't be film noir if it didn't LOOK good would it?Early on a junkie nearly shoots a spear gun through Kilmer's eye. If only he'd gone through with it we'd all have been spared THE SALTON SEA. Even if you manage to watch the entire 100 minutes, you won't gain your sealegs. This isn't quite as mind numbingly awful as FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, but it comes close.Even though the make-up department may be able to paint convincing tattoos on Kilmer's back they can't disguise the fact that the man is (still) a lousy actor. Dear God. Save us from more movies this awful. The DVDs extras includes interviews with the cast and crew praising this mind numbing travesty of celluloid. For those of you who are now bored senseless, let's recap the movies' supposed plot. Val Kilmer may (or may not) be an LAPD nark. Try writing a thesis on this one. Yet again. my review stinks but so does the movie, and it's not worth wasting my energy reviewing it properly. Counting sheep is more fun than watching this, but then again, you'd expect a NZer to say that wouldn't you?

$REVIEW.: Superb DigicomTV restoration of an Agatha Christie classic. Remarkable sound and video quality make this movie a must watch!The movie begins with ten characters, each with a skeleton in his or her closet, on a remote island off the English coast. They soon realize that they have been brought there by an insane judge, who has tried each of them for criminal behavior in the past, and who now feels it is his duty to render proper justice for each. The struggle to stay alive begins as each "guest" is eliminated in a fashion that corresponds to the nursery rhyme, "Ten Little Indians Went Out to Dine". You'll have to watch the movie to see who gets murdered and how......Barry Fitzgerald pulls off another remarkable acting feat in this film. He is comical, whimsical, and his use of sublime humor is wonderfully funny. What a great actor!!! You'll love his performance throughout...."Half my patients are sick because they want to escape reality," said the doctor. Peeping through keyholes and serving up entrees to the guests from food which has fallen onto a dirty floor. Lots of silly, funny scenes and comments pepper this movie.A really must watch for those who are avid Christie fans, or for anyone who just wants to enjoy a great, classic murder mystery!!!

$REVIEW.: This movie is pretty fast paced, if you blink for too long, you can miss quite a lot. I am part of the MTV generation, so faster pace does keep me more interesting in a film, but this one I felt could have been slowed down a little bit. Not just that, but you go from Abe's childhood, to a young man to him being president very quickly, and it feels like something has been missed out on in-between... maybe someday a director cut will come out that gives the pace of the film a reasonable flow, but I felt this one just goes a bit too fast. The beginning and middle I didn't enjoy that much, but the final action scenes where done nice enough to keep me away from twiddling my thumbs and just enjoy the excitement.I don't have to explain the plot to you do I? I'm sure you know who its about and what he does.Overall, I'd say rent it before making any decision to purchase your own copy. For me, it's not one I would watch again for a while, but it was good for one nights entertainment.

I have to rank this one up there with Steel Magnolias and Fried Green Tomatoes on my favorites of all time list.Like most reviews here say, this one definitely tugs at your heart strings.  It moves at a nice slow pace, but there's not a single character here you won't connect with.If you've ever suffered from the hate or at the hands of someone who made you feel inferior, or you've ever lost someone way too soon, then you will love this movie.  Dakota Fanning is amazing as a young girl who escapes the hands of an unloving father only to find herself retracing her dead mother's path in life.Set in the Civil Rights crisis of the 60's, the film uses racism only as a backdrop to a much worse hate in the world than the ones that often burden our own shoulders, rather than any form of political statement.  Grab the tissues for this one and prepare to forever be changed.

$REVIEW.: "The Android Invasion" is an easily overlooked gem from midway through Tom Baker and producer Philip Hinchcliffe's second season. Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes were phasing out the classic villains and UNIT-centered adventures that had dominated the Jon Pertwee years and started bringing in gothic horror- and steampunk-inflected stories that would so transform the series in the next two years.The Doctor and Sarah land in a wood outside the village of Devesham, located near an important space defense station, which may be leaking radiation. Strange men in white spacesuits take pot shots at them with guns that fire from their fingertips. A soldier from UNIT runs headlong off a cliff. His wallet contains new, uncirculated coins all minted in the same year. Similar coins are found at the pub in the village, which appears completely deserted. Expressionless villagers are later trucked in like mannequins by the white spacemen, and the dead UNIT soldier comes back to life. Meanwhile, the TARDIS mysteriously takes off without the Doctor or Sarah inside. Somebody's obviously up to no good--but who and what?The above-average script by Terry Nation combines elements of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" with the best of The Avengers, a series for which Nation contributed scripts and was script editor its final season. Tom Baker and Elisabeth Sladen turn in chilling performances as copies of themselves in a story that relies heavily on mystery and psychological menace rather than sophisticated special effects to convey action and suspense. The only unconvincing bits are the rubber-masked aliens behind "The Android Invasion" and the androids' poor marksmanship; none of the robots can aim a pistol or machine gun well enough to hit the broad side of a barn, let alone the Doctor at close range.The Special Features are equally good in this outing: the 30-minute making-of documentary interviews townspeople from East Hagbourne, the village where exterior locations for "The Android Invasion" were shot. The production attracted scores of children who gathered from miles around to watch the proceedings and get their pictures taken with Tom Baker, who appeared to relish all the fan attention. In "Life After Who: Philip Hinchcliffe," TV presenter Celina Hinchcliffe interviews her father about series he produced after leaving Doctor Who in 1977, most notably Private Schulz, The Charmer, and The Gravy Train.

$REVIEW.: This dippy sci-fi/fairy-tale hybrid from Belgium takes Carlo Collodi's little wooden boy and blasts him straight to Mars.  After a few minutes of this kiddie schlock, you'll probably feel like getting blasted yourself._Pinocchio in Outer Space_ does take pains to remain scientifically plausible, by 1960s standards at least -- with one notable exception: The film's antagonist is a jet-propelled space whale named Astro.  Whenever he appears, the film flies giddily off the rails, entering what can only be described as an alternate, psychedelic universe.Director Ray Goossens lifts jokes, character business and entire scenes from the 1940 Disney feature.  But to be fair, the Disney studio may have done some borrowing, too, when it launched a whole pod of flying space whales to Respighi's "Pines of Rome" in _Fantasia 2000_.

$review_text.: Oh man...yesterday I 'treated' myself to a mini Larry Buchanan film festival and I am now suffering from hangover like symptoms this morning.  I thought it kind of odd that I should watch these two terrible movies on Oscar night, a night when Hollywood celebrates its' best films.Anyway, Azalea Productions, which worked with American International Television, a subsidiary of American International Pictures (AIP), was sort of a dumping ground for AIP's younger stars that lost some of their sheen.  Azalea's productions where beyond cheap, and mostly produced for TV, turning out such schlock as The Eye Creatures (1965), Zontar the Thing from Venus (1966), among others.  Larry Buchanan, director of Mars Needs Women (1967), was in charge, and pretty prolific.  Retromedia presents two of his more memorable (or forgettable) telefilms here.It's Alive (1969) stars once popular Disney star Tommy Kirk, who appeared in films like Old Yeller (1957), The Shaggy Dog (1959), and Swiss Family Robinson (1960), but once he became older, lost his appeal towards casting directors and was forced to dwell in movie hell.  The plot for this movie is basically a young New York couple, the Sterns, gets lost in the Ozarks, meets Wayne Thomas (Tommy Kirk), a paleontologist working in the area, who directs the Sterns to a nearby house in that they may get some gasoline and make it back to civilization.  The secluded house belongs to a man named Greely (Billy Thurman), who also runs a sort of dinosaur park with wild animals that he's captured over the years.  He's got snakes, wildcats, monkeys (where the heck did he capture monkeys in the Ozarks?) and something lurking in the caves behind his house, his prize possession.  Seems Greely found a prehistoric creature, and feeds the occasional lost traveler to his 'pet'.  Wayne comes by to check up on the couple, and Greely knocks him out, and throws him in the cave with the Sterns.  Greely also has a housekeeper of sorts living with him, Bella, who, it turns out, was in a similar situation as the young couple a few years ago, and Greely kept her to make meals, clean house, etc.  We spend a great deal of time hearing her story and how she tried to escape in what had to be the longest flash back I've ever seen, but since she's relating the story to the couple and Wayne, it seemed utterly pointless to let it go on so long, as we knew she didn't escape.  Obviously padding to fill out the 80 minute run time.  Anyway, stuff happens, and we actually only get to see the creature for like five minutes, but I suppose that was a good thing as we had already seen it in a previous Azalea made-for-TV film, Creature of Destruction (1967), and the suit hasn't been holding up none too well.  This mess finally comes to a close, with the screen displaying The End?  I'm serious, they put a question mark after the words 'The End' as if to warn us that someone, one day, will revive these characters, or, at least the plot.  Poor Tommy Kirk...The second film in this festival of pain is called In the Year 2889 (1967), and deals with survivors of a post-nuclear world.  This film stars another Disney alum and 50's TV child star Paul Petersen, who many may remember as Jeff Stone on the Donna Reed Show.  Seems Captain John Ramsey (Neil Fletcher) has spent a number of year building a home in a secluded valley, one perfectly suited to protect him, his daughter, and her soon to be husband from post nuclear radiation.  It has something to do with lead in the cliffs and a lake with an internal hot spring.  Anyhow, this secluded valley isn't as secluded as we were led to believe, as various individuals begin to show up.  First a young, wayward couple, then Steve (Paul Petersen) and his radiation poisoned brother, and then finally a local rancher/moonshiner, played by Billy Thurman.  The captain gets irate, as he had only planned provisions for three people, but now has to deal with seven.  He soon has something else to worry about as it's discovered mutants are roaming the valley, eating various game, and tensions within the house begin to grow, developing into a real power struggle.  Will the survivors be able to fight off the mutants and keep from killing themselves in the process?  Will humanity as we know it disappear from the face of the Earth, or will these people be able to save it from the brink of extinction?  To be honest with you, I stopped caring about five minutes in...maybe sitting through the first feature wore me down.The picture quality was decent on these two films, but wear was noticeable.  Both look as if they were shot on 35mm film, and there are plenty of tedious voice-overs.  The production quality is non-existent, but I wasn't expecting a lot anyway.  There are two special features, one being a piece with Paul Petersen, talking about his experiences in the industry, who he got started and such, and a little of how he ended up in this dog.  He also goes on about his cause of helping child stars of past and present avoid the unpleasant experiences he went through being chewed up and spat out by a once uncaring Hollywood system.  There is also a nifty photo gallery of Paul Petersen including stills of himself, and pictures of his various projects including records and books.  Not a bad release of some truly awful films, good for a few laughs...and I have to say, Billy Thruman, a veteran of many a Buchanan film, was kind of fun to watch, especially in It's Alive.Cookieman108

$REVIEW.: Here's a movie that was hyped up quite a bit because it reunited the "Titanic" duo of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.  Who would have thought the reunion would have produced such a dud?Essentially, this movie is like experiencing a protracted episode of cable tv's "Mad Men".  As a period piece, it simply doesn't work. It lacks any semblance of authenticity.As others have pointed out in their reviews, DiCaprio struggles in adult roles because of his boyish appearance.  Any actor who could grow a convincing four o'clock shadow probably would have been better in the role.The director seems to try to balance the importance of both DiCaprio's and Winslet's roles, but clearly the story should be more weighted towards Winslet.  When you break it down, this is not so much a story about a shipwrecked marriage as it is a portrait of a woman's unhappiness.It's a story similar to Sylvia Plath's "Bell Jar", about a woman with a creative temperament who is stifled in a marriage, her personality ultimately spiraling towards madness.But despite Winslet delivering what I would call a "solid but not overly spectacular" performance, the problem is that the movie is dull.  Neither character inspires much sympathy.Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick were better in "The Days of Wine and Roses", as were Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" "American Beauty" is a far superior movie to this, and so probably is "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit".Much has been made of Kate Winslet's bravado as an actress. She had a very good year in 2008, and her role in "The Reader" was deservedly praised.  Kate's appearance seems to have taken on a hard cast, lately. I wish her more good roles, but I hope that the roles are not exclusively "unhappy women", and that they are more fully realized than this rather one-dimensional role in "Revolutionary Road".

$review_text.: Unfortunately, this version is far short of the Marlon Brando version, which I rate with 5 stars

The fault is not in the casting of Heston versus Brando as Anthony

Both are outstanding

Heston may give an even better rendition of the funeral oration than Brando, though perhaps Brando is stronger in the rest of the play

Both versions benefit from the presence of Gielgud, whose lean and hungry energy drives Cassius throughout the 1953 version, and who is a strong Caesar here


But the earlier version perhaps profits more because Cassius is the more significant role, and Louis Calhern was also an imperial Caesar in 1953


Diana Rigg is outstanding in this version, but Deborah Kerr was also outstanding in the earlier movie
The superiority of the 1953 film lies elsewhere
Everyone in the 1953 cast was outstanding, including all the minor roles, which is not true here
This version suffers greatly by comparison


And the direction of the 1953 film was superb; in this version it's lackluster


Even the black and white of the earlier version adds to the stark and tragic drama

But most notably, James Mason in the earlier film was an ideal Brutus, a perfect portrait of a good and noble man misled into making bad choices at every turn

Robards, on the other hand, plods through this version, struggling with the rhythms of the language

His portrayal is so bland that it is completely unbelievable that anyone would want him as a leader of such a great and deadly conspiracy.

$REVIEW.: Flatliners is a remarkably audacious, wildly original exploration of one of the taboo topics of science and religion. Like Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, this film cannot be considered an all-time  classic due to a highly opinionated viewpoint that may deeply offend some  viewers. However, as far as direction, acting and suspense are concerned,  few films rival Flatliners in its all-around splendor. Underneath a  deceptively linear and seemingly simplistic script, there is much symbolism  and underlying subtlety to be found in Schumacher's brilliant vision.  Unlike the roller-coaster scenes of The Lost Boys that never materialize to  be anything more than a misplaced piece of high-style imagery, the eerie,  sometimes sacrilegious images that are thrown into the plot of Flatliners  in a seemingly random fashion (the statues observed by the main character  in the beginning, the merciless display of surgical operations) serve their  purpose in implying the motivations and internal conflicts of the  characters. Charged with alternatingly surprising and desperately  predictable scenes, Flatliners is an exciting experience that will either  frighten you or fascinate you but definitely will not leave anyone  indifferent.

$review_text.: Abigail Breslin is Nim, a young girl living in an isolated island in the South Pacific alone with her father Jack (Gerard Butler). When her father, a slightly eccentric biologist, is missing after a heavy storm, Nim asks for a help from the most unlikely person in the world: Alexandra Rover (Jodie Foster), an agoraphobic writer living in a big city, famous for her successful "Alex Rover" series, Indiana Jones-like adventure novels. "Nim's Island" has the right ingredients to make a great family picture (and a nice change of pace for Jodie Foster), which it is not, however as the film is helmed by wrong directors.In fact, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin's "Nim"s Island" could have been a great family picture with a better director. In the film's introduction Nim is shown as an independent and clever girl who can also communicate with animals. The imaginative girl has a lot of stories to tell us, about her mother (apparently dead) and father, animals, island and herself. She is also a gifted storyteller (as the film's introduction shows) and is good at using computers too.But somehow the director team didn't realize that such an intelligent girl would not mistake tourists for buccaneers. Even if she does, she doesn't need a slapstick comedy sequence like flying lizards. After the promising beginning, the film's story suddenly starts to meander in the mid-section with a train of silly set-pieces, and we start to think: Well, Nim has sent a message to Alexandra, a reclusive writer to come over to help her, but why should she do that if she is really a clever girl? Isn't that impractical and most of all, a bit selfish? But the film doesn't seem aware of that, leaving us far behind.Of course the contrived situation could be forgotten if the film provides us with a good story, in this case, a story of Alexandra. I hate to say this, but Jodie Foster's "comic" antics as fish-out-of-water Alexandra only irritated me with her terrible overacting. Here is a job for directors who should have stopped the camera to say "no" to her. I really like her, but it is painful to watch her yelling, stumbling and vomiting (twice), all clich&eacute;. Is this all necessary after all when the film is titled "Nim's Island"?

$REVIEW.: This is a good film, but it is not going to be for everybody.  It is a very sad tale, poignant and somber.  The acting is superb as the story slowly and meticulously unfolds.  That said, this film is not for the impatient, as is the tradition of modern Japanese film the story is protracted and heavy, virtually forcing the viewer to become invested in the characters and to feel the weight of their moral burdens.  The critical themes that emerge are unquestioning love, selflessness, selfishness, and social responsibility.  In short, a young boy is left to care for his siblings when his mother abandons them.  It is a story filled with images of daily life in modern Japan, the setting for a heart wrenching story of the hope and the promise that a child can find anywhere.If you are not a fan of modern Japanese cinema, then this film is probably not for you.  In other words, if you are looking for something to experiment with, do not purchase this.  This is for those who like Japanese film and understand a bit about Japanese culture and enjoy the exploration of these virtures...that one does not show emotion, one does not show tears, one does not reveal to the world their inner fears, thoughts or desires.  If this is your cup of tea then it will be particularly moving to see such themes so convincingly acted by mere children.  For me, that was the essence of this film and is a very real portrayal of the skills needed to survive in Japanese culture, the pride of a young boy to care for his siblings even to the end of honoring his promises.If you happen to have already seen this film and loved it, or would like an additional recommendation, check out "Crying Out Love, In the Center of the World (2004)" a film that won 6 awards (including 3 Japanese Academy Awards) and was nominated for 7 others.

Trudie is beautiful and complements James in these routines, although some are simply James and do not include Trudie.I love the 3 dance routines: there is a very short warm up routine; the main routine is 25 minutes and the other is shorter, but with similar moves. I am not a dancer myself, and I tend to trip over my feet and have difficulty with rhythm, but I could totally follow this sequence and have fun doing it too! I use this exercise video on days when I want a fun, fairly easy workout. The setting is beautiful and lively, upbeat music takes me out of a funk if I've had a bad day. It's my fun "bounce around in my yoga room" workout!The 3rd routine is an absolutely wonderful stretching, but you must have a foam roller to follow this segment. You can either use a soft or hard roll. You will work your whole body with this very deep tissue self massage routine especially if you use a hard roll.See many of my other review on Amazon, includes the others in this series.

$REVIEW.: Mixing Science Fiction with comedy is a risky proposition, unless the film in question is a sendup of Sci-Fi films (I still can't decide if "Mars Attacks" was worth the matinee price I paid to see it almost a decade ago).  "Men in Black", however, is a near perfect blend of Science Fiction and comedy.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are two of the most watchable actors out there, and the pairing of the two in this film is ingenious.  The supporting cast,from Linda Fiorentino to Tony Shaloub, is top notch.  The special effects, from the dragonfly flight during the opening credits to the spaceship crash near the finale are excellent.  The writing is also much more clever than one might expect from a Sci-Fi picture - the film has to be viewed several times to catch all the barbs and asides Smith and Lee throw at each other.  All in all, one of the most entertaining Sci-Fi films to come along in quite a while.

$REVIEW.: The whole premise had me scratching my head. Corporate executives do not go to prison due to liability on their products even if they deliberately produce a product that will harm people. Ford Motor company proved that with their exploding Pinto. So now Kevin Spacey spends 8 years in prison and his family never comes to see him? Once you get past that...and I never really did, we end up with a movie that has some good scenes connected by a bad plot.I didn't like Heather Graham defining herself as a lesbian to strangers. That was so unreal and not funny. The negative relationships and feelings that were rampant against Kevin Spacey, was not believable. Kevin played a guy whose only fault was that he enjoyed his work. If you want a somewhat feel good comedy without f-bombs, sex, or nudity this one might fill in...but don't think too hard about it.

$review_text.: This movie would've worked a lot better as a thirty minute episode of Tales From The Crypt or some other scary show anthology. Because it tries to draw its paper-thin plot out to feature length, huge flaws in the script quickly jump out at you, as opposed to all of the other, scarier things that are supposed to jump out at you during a horror film.Angie, a devout Catholic girl, travels far from home to attend a community college where she plans to major in art history. Just let that sink in for a bit. Although this community college has dorms (???) she is staying with an immediately hateful roommate who has managed to let Angie's bed slip through her fingers. To find the cash to support herself and get a new bed, Angie decides to babysit a quiet boy who lives with his rustic mom and dad way out in the bluffs. Then things get spooky!Ha ha. No, they don't. There are a few well done moments at the start of the film, including a quick false scare in an art class, but the script is too threadbare to really hold too much suspense or interest. First of all, the characters are so stereotypical that they come across as bored of themselves. You have the world's worst acted pot head, the dashing love interest with no personality traits other than a sudden and inexplicable willingness to be The Perfect Guy, and a clueless cop or two.And, of course, there's Angie, perhaps one of the most boring characters I've ever encountered in film. Her major character traits include being frightened by everything and talking to herself with some of the most wooden dialogue I've seen outside of a community college video brochure. &#34;Maybe watching some TV will help me relax,&#34; she says at one point to no one at all. Oh, brother. Then she turns on the TV and it's too loud! &#34;You shouldn't leave your TV on so loud if you don't want to wake people up,&#34; she says as she lowers the volume. Now THAT'S dialogue!Anyway, when Angie's lines DO get a little spunky, they are equally cheesy, just in the opposite direction. Obviously, her babysitting gig goes wrong in a few ways, and she gets the chance to scream and run and fall down for no reason and kick and claw and slash with a few choice tidbits like &#34;Suck it!&#34; or something like that. But it's still pretty humdrum stuff. A lot of this is because for the first fifty minutes, the movie uses the &#34;slow pan with loud rising violin sound like something exciting is going to happen AND IT'S A ... [insert nonscary thing here]&#34; trick once every two minutes. Scary movies have to create atmosphere, but this editing trick is like the iron lung of horror movie tropes, and it gets really old, really fast. At one point, alone in the kitchen, Angie reaches for the cupboard. We see her hand move slowly, the tense trill of the music rises in volume, she opens the cupboard, the music HITS A CRESCENDO AND -- DEAR GOD WHAT IS IT? -- there are cups there. That's it.The only character or moment to have any kind of spark is the boy's father, who is trying to hard to channel Bruce Campbell that it's almost admirable. However, his character and his moments to shine -- as well done as they are -- feel really out of place in the banal and rather predictable rest of the film. As dull as its leading lady, the movie would've had a lot more spark had it been released as a short film with all of its bloated musical scares and cheesy character development sliced away leaving nothing but the raw meat of it behind.

$REVIEW.: A complete departure from the standard THE TEN COMMANDMENTS with Charlton Heston, which was more of a romantic story, this deals with the more probable Moses and his retrival from the river; his life; and the complex politics of the freed people.  I was impressed from its more realistic viewpoints, e.g.,  from the original The 10 Commandmants (with Charlton Heston), the people made a cow of gold; but in this movie it was made of stone lined with glass, not as a god, but a symbol of their conquest against the Malachites and their new freedoms. That sounds more probable. Also, God didn't strike them dead afterwards as punishment as depicted in the Heston version, but most likely, as depicted in this movie, there was a civil war in terms who is the leader of the clan. They learned warfare and simply used it against each other and the losing party was sentenced to death.  VERY INTERESTING!! WOW!!!Special effects: Actually, I thought the ORIGINAL 10 commandments had better special effects, however, I liked this movie's effects better--it was more conservative, yet extremely impressive at the same time, which made it more realistic.This movie is nearly 3 hours long--I was enthralled the WHOLE TIME, not one single yawn, not one single instant was I bored. It took me into the movie and kept me in there. I was irritated when I had to put the movie on PAUSE because I had to go to the bathroom--I wanted to keep on watching it!!  YOU KNOW THIS IS RARE AMONG MOVIES. I could not believe the time went by so quick despite being a 3 hours movie. It was GREAT! And sooo incredibly rare that a modern movie can be this great.Whether or not you believe in the story of Moses for it may be fact or fiction is rather immaterial.  The point is, THE WAY IT IS PRESENTED IN THE MOVIE IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY it happened along these lines rather than in another way. It kept in touch with the realities of the politics and pressures that will manifest in any group, at any century. In the older version of the 10 commandments it presents itself as total fiction with Moses the romantic finding God, becoming Moses the saint or whatever. This movie does not. It's more of a probable slant. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.Acting: SUPERB!!! REALLY SUPERB!! And it was very nice to see Omar Sharif in there, and he did do a very good job. The whole move was awesome.

That means this is a movie you can enjoy either once or not at all. I enjoyed it once, despite the blatant implausibility of the plot. It's about two girls, Marie and Alex, visiting the home of Alice's family. They plan to stay for a few days, but it doesn't take long for all heck to break loose in the form of what is presumably the local serial killer arriving at their front porch in the dead of the night.marcellee.com

$REVIEW.: This film is pure c..p.  For many years, there has been explicit sex used in many mainstream European films.  It is no longer the novelty it once was.  There is a point where you don't care about the sex, and you just wonder whether the film is any good.  So, yes, there are explicit sex scenes here, but that's it.  If you like porn, I would actually recommend watching something different, because the filmmakers here are trying to make us think that this is an important film.  It isn't.  You're better off looking at porn.  Baise Moi (roughly translated means "rape me") looks cheap (shot on DV), and it's a poor man's Thelma and Louise, with some John Woo style shootouts thrown in.  The film isn't intelligent or innovative in the least.  It is actually incredibly boring and feels like a 3 hour film, despite the fact it's only 73 minutes long.  If you want to see intelligent, thoughtful filmmaking on sexual matters, rent and/or buy Catherine Breillat's films.  Her films are far superior to this trash.

$review_text.: M*A*S*H is one of the zaniest and most intelligent satires ever produced by Hollywood.  This is a war movie in which only two shots are fired -- as signals in a football game.  It is a masterpiece of wider appeal -- even to veterans -- than is suggested by its setting in Korean War military hospitals, or by its director's explicit aim of promoting liberal opposition to the Vietnam war during the '60s and '70s.The 2002 two-disk M*A*S*H special edition from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in many ways is a benchmark for DVD releases of cult movies.  Picture and sound quality are high.  The special feature content is entertaining and insightful.This content includes extensive retrospective comment by director Robert Altman, producer Ingo Preminger, former studio boss Richard Zanuck, scriptwriter Ring Lardner Jr, actors including Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Sally Kellerman, Tom Skerritt, John Schuck and Gary Burghoff, and medical veterans of the Korean War.  We see the 30th anniversary M*A*S*H reunion at Fox, and presentation of a studio life achievement award to Altman.The special content gives fascinating insights into the driving half-mad genius that so often makes a great director, and of egos and bigheartedness in movie making.Almost everyone, from the scriptwriter to the studio executives and the actors, lined up against the director at some time.  Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould once even tried to get Altman fired, fearing that he would damage their careers.  In the M*A*S*H special edition features they eat their words and graciously pay tribute to Altman.  Former studio boss Richard Zanuck says that until Altman came along other directors were afraid of the screenplay or didn't like it.  'Altman came in, and seemed unruly enough to be able to understand this subject matter.'M*A*S*H was made on a shoestring budget with Fox's Century Ranch standing in for Korea.  It emerged from chaotic creative tension as an enormous artistic and financial success.  Altman accepted a salary of only $75,000.  His son Mike is reputed to have made more money from writing the lyric to the keynote ballad, 'Suicide Is Painless', with Johnny Mandel.  Altman kept costs down by casting the movie with mostly unknown and out-of-work actors.  14 of the movie's 30 speaking roles were played by actors making their screen debut.  Shooting finished three days ahead of schedule in 1969, and almost half a million dollars under budget.  M*A*S*H went on to earn more than $80 million at the box office, a Palme d'Or at Cannes and an Oscar (for the heavily reworked script of formerly blacklisted scriptwriter Ring Lardner Jr), and to inspire a long-running popular TV series.This is a rare thing: a five star classic movie in a five star DVD release.

$review_text.: An experimental play brought to the screen as a major Hollywood production, featuring the biggest all-star cast since THE LONGEST DAY. The result is a monumental flop worth looking (once)!The idea is simple: take the Great War, contrast the grim reality of trench warfare with the merry songs it produced, then use the irony to comment on the current Vietnam War (1969). Simple piece that can be done in a theater workshop.  Well, somehow the word got around, the stars started signing, the pounds started flowing and the project started veering much to the disgrace of the effect intended. In the end one feels as exhausted as the combatants themselves, tired of the gore, the silly tunes and the interminable boredom in-between.Regarding the cast, most of the Big Names appear in the first scene, playing the European monarchs about to unleash Armaggedon, so watch closely for Ian Holm as President Poincar&eacute;, Kenneth More as Kaiser Wilhelm, and Jack Hawkings as Emperor Franz Josef. Edward Fox, the late & lovely Susannah York, Dirk Bogarde, John Gielgud Michael Redgrave,, Vanessa Redgrave, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Jane Seymour, Ralph Richardson, Juliet Mills, John Mills (Haig) and Laurence Olivier (French) pop in to say Hi; yes, it's me!. My favorite? Maggie Smith, doing a rowdy vaudeville number in order to recruit young dupes.Richard Attenborough, then a young actor, directs. It was his first, and he took a liking for epics, for he subsequently made YOUNG WINSTON, A BRIDGE TOO FAR, GANDHI, IN LOVE AND WAR and a few other mammoth productions!P.S.: When I wrote "Great War songs" I meant BRITISH Great War songs. You won't find La Madelon, Lili Marlene or Over There! in the repertoire.

$REVIEW.: It's very rare these days to find an action movie or a comedy that has any thought behind it at all.  RED is brilliantly written.  So many movies are written for what I consider to be the "dumb" general public... very slapstick, typical, predictable humor.  This movie was entertaining without being predictable in any way.  The actors were fantastic in their delivery, and made for a genuinely funny action comedy.  John Malcovich makes the movie.  He is proof that most of the "funny" in comedy comes from the delivery of simple lines.  I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  Worth every minute!

This movie may not be the best movie to show to younger kids, because they may get afraid of the concpet of someone knowing their whole life and trying to kill people.Robin Williams did a good job, and all the characters in this movie were very well played!  There was not much of a plot, but what they did have was pretty well planed.There was no "Thrilling" special/visual effects and no "Stand-Out" music, but that's ok because this type of movie does not require eaither.This might be a movie to rent though, as it is one of those that you can see twice and be done with.~Hope this helps

$REVIEW.: I loved bowling for columbine, and I was aching to see this.  And I was very pleased by the movie.  Altho I seen some of it before, I'm just glad to see alot of facts I didn't know of until now.Michael Moore in this documentery definitly shows how the country changed after 9/11.  I mean people lived in fear, and all the facts in this movie show makes you wonder, how the bule motherfudge did Bush get re-elected?  I loved the way how he used the music and stuff, it really made you get quite a bit of comic humor out of it.  He made the truth stand out in any way you thought about it.  I thought it was pretty funny.  It's sad that I'm thinking of the goverment of the county that I'm in like that.(Or is it our president?  Man this film opened up too many conspiracy theories)I also read alot of reviews stating that this movie is crappy, Michael Moore is stupid, and that he used too much grief in this.  Well this movie is far from crappy, I mean in America today, people want to hear more stuff, and hearing stuff like this to take a turn from that same ol' stuff in the newspapers, it's just, we'll to me, and libaly many others saying, it's about time, and if Michael Moore is stupid, then why the fudge is he even doing a film?(Let alone get all these interesting facts)  Lemme guess, give a monkey a film, and he'll get rich eh?  And too much grief? look this war is REAL, the people dying are REAL. It's no fun and games; there's no joy in wars, even in pointless wars like this.Michael Moore definitly made a contraversial film here.  I mean I herd alot of my friends, and review boards(Including this one)have tons of opinions about this film.  Well, my entiere review states my opinion.  Those who like Michael Moore, and are tired of seeing the same crap on the news, check this out.peace

$REVIEW.: This movie is not for the tender hearted, and if you are you will ball your eyes out about how evil violence is when done on other people.  the cost of freedom is to high and so many lives are taken by murder and hatred. War is just evil and there is no justification or excuse for such violence. if you can learn from this movie not to hate and get involved in violence then you understood the movie correctly. i hate hatred and murder not matter what and it is sad this stuff really happened. This movie is based on true history and fact when it comes to ireland becoming indpendent from england and how evil and brutal the english really are and how the irish including myself were affected by that cruelty so badly that it caused a whole war in ireland against the british nazi occupation of the emerald isle. this is true to the heart. England had never been in ireland or involved with ireland there would have been no IRA. England created the violence in ireland not the other way around. Eamon de valera said and i quote "better to die as martyrs for freedom than to be the ones who make martyrs like the english" ' He did not have the stomach for violence and hatred but he had more heart about how to handle the situation. He admitted it was his downfall and felt guilty of michael collins his great friend's death.  Hopefully God willing we can learn from this movie and from Jesus Christ's own words is to "love your enemies and do righteousness (good) towards them"there is no love and righteousness when you murder people.Rabbi Nachman from the Soviet Union said "Our best weapon that G'd gave us is prayer not guns"

$review_text.: Once again, I see signs of the new Dark Age. This film is nothing but some zealot's (Gibson is part of this ultra-orthodox Catholic sect) view of what true Christianity is all about. I'd rather watch Hellraiser VII than re-wating this bloody, boring, organized-religion propaganda. People don't see this film as a film, its more like going to a revival meeting than going to a movie.The dogmatic view of true spiritual enlightenment through pain, death and suffering is nothing more than a means of social control to keep the disenfranchised in line. Historical evidence proves that this whole crucifixion story is suspect. Sadly, people are so hooked on their own suffering as a means of proving their devotion to God that they cannot face a more hopeful and uplifting story of Jesus.But, unlike alot of critics, I don't want to ban this ode to bloodletting. That is the religious fanatic's method of handling something they don't like.  This film is not a Piety test, its simply a poor movie based on a suspect story.God knows what the real story is, I would really like to see a movie based on historical fact rather than a snuff-film designed to scare rubes into rushing back to the church.

The first fight scene Had a kind of "Tom Cruize trying to be like Jacki Chan" vibe. When I say that, I mean in terms of humor, yeah I know it is funny when a bad guy tries to throw a knife in Jacki Chan's crotch and he blocks it and says "Not Cool!" but when Tom does it.... not so much.The whole time I was watching this movie, while I was mildly entertained, I could help but imagine Tom jumping up and down saying "Please like me again!!! I am sorry I jumped on Oprah's couch!!" The movie could have been a good flick, but the delivery sucked. Maybe the same people who made M.I.2 should have a hand in it and they could have fixed it, maybe I just have a bias when it comes to Tom Cruize.I will give it some credit for Cameron Diaz's line, "you should have just said 'if you get on the plane you're gonna *&^#ing die!" When Tom claimed he warned her about getting on a plane by saying "Things happen for a reason."Sorry if there was any spoilers, but you didn't really miss much if you haven't seen the flick

$REVIEW.: This is a much more relevant precursor to THE WALTONS than SPENCER'S MOUNTAIN. It's a good story and an enjoyable introduction to the TV series. All of the characters from the series are present though the adults are mostly played by different people.The time is Christmas of 1929. The country is in the grips of the great depression. John Walton has had to take work out of town in order to support his family in the Blue Ridge Mountains. He is trying to get home for Christmas and is overdue. There is a blizzard and the radio tells of a bus crash. All are worried as they await the return of the father. The oldest son, John-boy, is sent out to try and find him, having several adventures along the way.There is nothing particularly exciting but it is wholesome, enjoyable and worth watching. The family comes together to take care of its own and do the best they can in trying circumstances.

Personally speaking, I loved Moulin Rouge the first time I saw it, and have seen it several times since then... It provides comedy, drama, and one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen...One of the biggest complaints I've heard is that it's just too *busy*, particularly in the opening dance scene at the Moulin Rouge.  Believe me, I agree that scene was frenzied, but get through it if you can.The long and short of it is, this is either a movie that you really like or you really don't... Be forewarned that it is UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN!  Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing-- well you'll just have to decide for yourself

The scene where John shows Cyrus that he found his sneakers and they finally call each others bluff is movie genius and completely hilarious.  This is a realistic funny movie that somehow flew under the radar.

It actually caused me to get goose bumps, during the skating sequences, and a popular hit came on, that I was very familiar with."Lil' Bow Wow" (Sorry, I refuse to call him Bow Wow) was awesome!  His acting skills are very high.  No Academy Award performances, but still very good.  He really looked like somebody from the 70's.  Major kudos to the costume staff.  Great Retro 70's look throughout.  Including the old looking suit the father wore in his work scenes.  I also enjoyed the comedy relief of the garbage collectors.  Very funny!I highly recommend buying this one.

$REVIEW.: "John Q" is an emotional and powerful film that delivers a much needed message about the state of healthcare in this country. John "Q" Archibald (Denzel Washington) is a father who's having a rough time. His hours at work are being cut, his car has been repossessed and his wife is getting edgy since there's no money around. But things get unbelievably worse. During a little league game, his son drops in the middle of the field and passes out. After tests at the hospital, it's learned that John's son will need a heart transplant or he will die. But John can't afford the $250,000 price tag, so he eventually takes matters into his own hands and takes control of the emergency room, taking hostages until his son has a new heart.The story is a somewhat fresh idea and the acting in the film is wonderful (if not a little melodramatic). All the actors in the film do an exceptional job with the exception of Anne Heche, who I thought was a little lackluster. Denzel is fantastic and gives another oscar worthy performance.I gave the film 4 stars instead of 5 because I felt that they could have made the film a little more "edgy" being the circumstances John Q was put in. But I guess they were leaning towards a more family atmosphere even with the adult subject matter.The dvd is very well done. The film is presented in widescreen format and looks great. No serious artifacting or imperfections present. The audio is also more than exceptable. There are some deleted scenes (which are really just alternate versions of some of the scenes that are in the film.) and a commentary track.Overall, this was a very enjoyable and thought provoking movie. Although it may not be for everyone due to the melodramatic atmosphere, but I suggest at least renting it.

$review_text.: "Actions speaking louder than words" is the benchmark of what Alfred Hitchcock would label pure cinema. THE HUNTED is a dramatic tour de force of pure cinema. Tommy Lee Jones as the "hunter" and Benicio Del Toro as the "hunted" are perfectly cast and deliver frightenedly realistic performances. William Friedkin's direction disposes any hint of a smooth narrative flow. Instead Friedkin relies on the strengths of his two leads to interpret the strange camaraderie that exists between the man who teaches to kill and the man who will not stop killing. The teacher and the viewer know that there is only one way to stop the pupil. The opening of the film suggests that Del Toro has become traumatized by the inhumanity he witnesses in Kosovo and an extermination we see him carry out in that war zone. Now Del Toro has started killing hunters in the northwest forests and Jones must reluctantly agree to stop him. I really liked Del Toro's performance because he does not seem to be a man traumatized by bloodshed but instead needs a purpose to continue practicing the skills that he is so ever proficient at. I equally liked Tommy Lee Jones' performance because he instinctively knows of this primal need that Del Toro must satisfy. The minimal plot and other characters in this film are only synergist elements to set the stage for Jones and Del Toro. Strangely the viewer identifies with Del Toro's character because we only see him kill those that extinguish life. They take life without really questioning the overall purpose of the system of right and wrong that has been created here on earth. Jones too is an instrument to that end which we can not truly fathom.

Freud didn't direct this movie and people that try to find hidden meanings in film are merely further examples of lifes occasional irritants.The movie was well done in every aspect and the lead actor must be a master script chooser as I have yet to see a movie he has been in that I didn't enjoy immensely. He is also very talented.It was also good to see a movie showing a family truly supportive of each other. A rarity from Hollywood these days.....which probably means it wasn't made in Hollywood.

$review_text.: This movie was nothing like I expected
 I don't know exactly what I was expecting...
but whatever it was ..

it wasn't what I got


 The cover of the movie is quite deceptive
 On the back of the movie when they say that pin is a harmless deaf mute ..


I still kind of thought he was alive or something, but he is just a dummy

 I felt bad for the 2 children in the movie ..
anyone living under the conditions in their parents house would probably end up going insane or atleast having some severe emotional or psychological issues

 So throughout the movie it was hard for me to not feel sorry for Leon (I love David Hewlett - CUBE is soooo much better though)
 It isn't Leon's fault that his mom was an obsessive compulsive cleaning freak and his dad was a weird and strict, uncaring person

 So what if that leads him to believe that his fathers medical dummy is his friend?  Pin was much nicer than his parents


 So I can't really blame him

 A child who has to live under those conditions is bound to have some kind of way to cope with all that is going on

 Pin was there to help him

 Perhaps there could have been better ways to help Leon than to convince him to kill people (although I cannot place the blame on poor Pin..


he is just an innocent by-stander ..

especially in the scene where the nurse does bad things to him!!  Naughty naughty!) but the idea of Pin being real was all in Leon's head..
I really wish someone had gotten him help..


especially his sister who seemed very oblivious to what was going on and when she finally did figure out that Leon was mental ..

she just went on with her little life and didn't bother to get him some treatment

 All in all, I've seen better movies, of course
 But I've also seen much worse.

You need to watch this film with the person you love and care so much about, without interruption.

$REVIEW.: This movie will appeal to artists, writers, thinkers and other "square pegs" who at one time or another felt completely disenfranchised with the world at large.The story involves two displaced teens inhabiting that zone between high school, college, or that slacker, $7.00 an hour job
That zone where you have to face the music and decide who you really are, what you want to be, and how you are going to get there


In other words, do you capitulate amd do the safe thing by listening to everybody else? Or do you face the consequences of potentially screwing up by just being yourself


(The odds, as we know, are stacked against being yourself.)It took me a while to "get" this movie since the environment itself plays a "character"
 That is to say, convienece stores, cell-block apartment buildings, trendy coffee shops, the local movieplex, and even an adult store
Subsequently the environment becomes this constraining factor in all of these people's lives thus illustrating how our environment shapes us.Thora Birch's performance is flawless as was all of the other actors

Her wardrobe is awesome
(Every outfit she wore from head to toe must of cost a thousand bucks but it looked like you could put it together from a thrift shop.) But then again, Thora Birch is definately not hard to look at!!!The music was good, lot's of blues and silly pop
...The dialog is intelligent, though the story is not your standard issue plot
This is not a "two-dogs-but-only-one-bone" type of story line

The story is about choices and consequences and how the environment itself has a say in it.Another neat point is that the daughter of R
Crumb, the counter culture comic book guy did all of the artwork in the lead character's sketchbook

 (She draws a lot like her dad.)It's worth owning, for sure!

I saw if for the first time the very weekend it came out and to this day, whenever its on TV, which is very often, I will flick it on and watch at least a little bit.  It's a film that is just as funny today as it was back then.  This is pure movie magic from the great music, to the multitudes of guest stars, to one of the greatest, certainly most destructive car chases in movie history.The problem isn't the film, but its the release.  It is nice to have the theatrical version to go along with the extended cut but the fact is this "anniversary edition" isn't much more than the special edition that just came out a few years ago.  The added featurettes such as the Belushi tribute and the lame House of Blues performance are NOT worth the $22.00 price tag or even the discounted price that Amazon is selling it for.  Certainly not if you own the previous collector's edition.  On top of that, having a double-sided disc is the ultimate in going cheap.  That's the kind of stuff you expect when you buy those bargain basement DVDs, not something from a big Studio like Universal.  What a shame that they couldn't put a bit more thought and cash into a truly legendary film.

$review_text.: This film in French and Russian language was made to show the story of the state of Russia shortly after WWII.  It starts in year 1946 with a premise that all Russian expatriates living abroad since year 1917 (October Revolution) were invited for re-patriation back to Russia.  We see a group of Russians leaving France with great hopes of reconnecting with their fatherland, offering new government their skills, talents and love for the country in an effort to build a new society after the devastating war.  We know that this bait will end badly from the start.  As these naive citizens step on the Russia soil the tragedy hits: elderly are separated from the young, families are being divided and before we know it a young French man of Russian decent is shot to death from the back by the eager Russian soldier.  Main protagonist of this story is a doctor who with wife and a young son gets rude awakening of what is the future for his family.  Deeply devoted to his wife, he will do whatever it takes top protect his family.  As time passes and the differences and tension between the couple increases, wife is becoming more determined to escape Russian and get back to France.  In the process and circumstances around them, she establishes relationship with a young Russian man who happens to live in the same apartmens with her family.  Without desclosing the plot, we learn about two people so desparate for freedom and nothing to loose that will do anything to reclaim it.  Over a period of 10 years lives of all of them are so profoundly changed that is hard to believe how can anyone endure such oppresion.  It will take another 30 years after their escape until borders are open again and Russian citizens can choose to stay or immigrate to any country of their choice.  See the rest of the movies by the talented Russian director Sergei Bodrov and his son who appears in many of his films, this one included (he had a role of young Russian lodger Sasha).

$REVIEW.: Arthur Bishop is a connoisseur of the finer things in life - wine, art, literature, music - and lives a secluded existence in his own organized world, observing the rest of humanity as an "outsider." His detached persona makes him uniquely suited to the demands of his profession, that of "the mechanic" or "hit man." Arthur is no moralist, but the ultimate pragmatist, and his victims mere losers in the giant scheme of life and death. He wryly observes that most of history's hero's were killers.  His job simply affords him the opportunity to create his own "book of rules" in a game that he was born into, but did not invent. He has molded his entire existence into one of absolute control, but the years have caught up with him in the form of loneliness and anxiety. A hit on a long time family friend becomes the catalyst for Arthur to take on an associate, more out of loneliness than necessity, and with this breach into this inner sanctuary, the entire premise of his "outside" existence is compromised.

$review_text.: Helen Baxendale and Annette Crosby are absolutely convincing in this gritty series, they brilliantly convey a range of nuance, and deserve 5 stars. But the material is problematic, with unfortunate discontinuities, and drastic changes in the set's offices and homes that viewers aren't supposed to notice, among other issues. Viewer Alert: The only way to watch the wonderful introductions by Diana Rigg, featuring Edward Gorey's deliciously macabre artwork, is to select by episode, separately. Don't choose "Play All," or you'll get awkward transitions between each mystery's episodes, with bits clumsily cut-out and very odd pacing. The friendship between the women is refreshing, surviving awkward moments. One can only wish the duo of "An Unsuitable Job" had continued, with more and better stories.Annette Crosby is also wonderful inHope Springs, welding a sword with fierce accuracy. Helen Baxendale is featured in "Counter Culture Blues," Disk 6, of the highly recommendedMasterpiece Mystery: Complete Inspector Lewis. "Unsuitable" is darker than the confectionRosemary & Thyme: Complete Collection, a pleasant escape to gardens throughout England, Spain, and France.

$review_text.: Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine play a pair of devoted parents, Johnny and Sarah, who bring their daughters to start a new life "In America."  Johnny and Sarah are virtually penniless and they take up residence in a tenement-like dwelling replete with drug addicts and other assorted deviants.  The daughters, Ariel and Christy, look upon the move as an exciting adventure to be savored.Jim Sheridan directed and co-wrote this somewhat autobiographical movie, and he dedicates it to his brother, Frankie, who died at the age of ten.  Johnny and Sarah are also bereaved.  They lost their young son, and they have had a very hard time letting go of their deep feelings of sorrow and grief."In America" is a rich tapestry of sights and sounds, and there are strong elements of magical realism that add a touch of whimsy to the story.  Jim Sheridan explores a number of themes in his film, such as the difficulty of facing the death of a loved one, the grinding humiliation of poverty, the hopes and dreams that keep us going, and the relationships that ultimately redeem us.Two sisters, Emma and Sarah Bolger, beautifully portray the young daughters.  These enchanting actresses contribute immeasurably to the film's effectiveness.  Djimon Hounsou is also a strong presence as a Nigerian neighbor with demons of his own who strikes up a friendship with the poor Irish family.Although "In America" is a small movie in many ways, it has a big heart and top-notch performances.  Sheridan directs with warmth and compassion, and I get the feeling that he knows how hard it is for an impoverished immigrant to leave his native land and start a new life in strange surroundings.

$review_text.: This movie i thought was going very well for the movie.  SPOILER! At the end of the movie I thought he was going to take out the entire small gang and then he got almost to the end and gets shot by the little s*** head kid.  The girl did not get saved, who knows what happened to her.  Good guy gets killed at the end.  I must be a cliche type of movie guy.  I hate it when bad guys win.  I want good guy wins and saves the girl.  Total opposite and worthless.  Only big fight scent went to s***.  Miller is a bad shot too. Way to waste your ammo on the walls.

$REVIEW.: Although the movies plot was to &#34;restart the sun&#34; due to a depletion of it's fusion fuel, that science says will not happen for billions of years, it was a good suspence movie.  I like action/suspence films and the CGI was pretty good, the acting was also very good even if the story could have been done better.  A near sun research ship rather than a desperate mission to restart the sun.  Oh well.  it is worth watching.

$REVIEW.: Man On Fire is one of the better action and revenge films to come along in a while. The story is simple: Denzel Washington plays an ex CIA operative who visits a friend in Mexico, played by Christopher Walken. His friend sets him up with a job as a bodyguard for a little girl for a semi-wealthy family. The little girl softens the hard heart of the bodyguard, and when everything is going great, she is kidnapped. The rest of the film is about what the bodyguard will do to settle the score and figure out what happened. Denzel Washinghton delivers another amazing performance as a broken down drunk, who slowly rediscovers happiness, only to have it taken away. Once that happens, we see his angry, but extremely efficient side, as he sets a plan in motion, that he carries out to perfection. Dakota Fanning is also amazing, as the bright little girl who shows Denzel life can still be good. The direction by Tony Scott is very stylish and effective, as it is gritty looking, much like the feel of the film. The action scenes are staged to perfection as well. This is one of the better action thrillers you will see all year. Man On Fire truly does sizzle!

If the NBC &#34;Suits&#34; had shut-up and kept their nose out of things where they didn't belong, Season Three, although still very good, would have been even better, which very likely would have lead to a fourth season.

$review_text.: Girlfight (Karyn Kusama, 2000)It's rare that TV station-produced films (this one comes courtesy of IFC) live up to their pre-release hype


Girlfight not only did so, IFC's commercials may have understated the case for this overlooked gem of a film.Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez [Resident Evil], in her big-screen debut) is a high school student with a very bad attitude and four trips to the principal's office in one semester for fighting

When she's asked to run some money from her father down to the Brooklyn gym where her brother trains, she finds herself intrigued by the idea that people can not only fight without getting called to the principal's office, but might actually get paid for it


From there, it's a pretty small step to begging, borrowing, and stealing in order to come up with the cash for her to start training as well


Hector (Law and Order regular Jaime Tirelli), one of the gym's trainers, is willing to take her on, and away we go.Part of the brilliance of Girlfight is that it's a sweet movie masquerading as a tough movie
While the film never loses focus on Diana's up-and-coming boxing career, Kusama balances the boxing with Diana's coming-of-age story; it's never explicitly said, but we get the feeling the developing relationship between her and another boxer is, in fact, her first real love affair
Another part of the brilliance is that it's a boxing movie that, well, doesn't have all that much boxing in it
Fight Club this ain't; there's actually very little in-the-ring action, and what there is is quite tastefully done (including some excellent from-the-fighter's-perspective camerawork)


At various times during the film, boxer affirmations tacked to the walls of the gym are focused on for a few seconds, and it's obvious that Kusama takes the first one very seriously-that boxing is a game of brains over brawn.Many mystery novelists could take some from Kusama about how to unobtrusively introduce storylines


 There is nothing of artifice in the way the film is set up; everything falls together in just the right way, to the point where much of the film has an almost documentary feel to it


Comparisons are inevitable, warranted, and favorable to Matty Rich's excellent film Straight Outta Brooklyn, but Kusama is a little more slick in her ability to keep everything smooth and well-paced throughout.Girlfight is yet another film from the supposedly mediocre crop of movies released in the year 2000 that puts paid in no uncertain terms to that judgment


In retrospect, 2000 may have been one of the strongest years for film, especially independent film, we've seen

$REVIEW.: The Cure is not a movie you want to watch without a good sturdy box of Kleenex....and that's coming from a guy.If it isn't bad enough that this film is actually ABOUT one of the most heart-wrenching scenarios that films can present: children sick and dying, then couple it with neglectful parenting and deeply emotional male bonding and what you've got is one helluva a strong weeper.Joseph Mazzello (Jurassic Park) has AIDS. He got it from a blood transfusion. His mother (Isabelle Sciorra) is devoted and loving of him. She also manages to extend her heart to her son's new found friend - Brad Renfro. Renfro's character has taken this outcast boy under his wing. Mazzello's character has become a pariah because most of the townspeople are ignorant of the realities of AIDS.From the onset, you know that Mazzello and Renfro are going to be big friends. But they become friends in the ol' Tom and Huck sense of the word - they're real devoted friends - the kind of friends you only have when you're a kid. It's a no holds barred, non-sexual type of male bonding going on here.I won't tell you any more about this film, but this...a girlfriend of mine watched this movie with me. She used an entire Kleenex box as we watched it. After it was over, she cursed me for having "made" her watch it. She was depressed for days afterward. She said it was one of the most emotionally charged films she'd ever seen.I had to agree.Truly awesome.

$REVIEW.: This is the worst film I ever tried to watch


I couldn't make it past the first half hour


Most of that half hour was spent on closeups of Kidman's face fixed in the one expression she uses to indicate any kind of emotion: lips slightly parted, brows drawn together, signifying worry? angst? gas?The script doesn't help us find out


It tries to be artsy and show Arbus' fascination with the freaks of the world


I know this from the description on the DVD case but I'd never get a clue from the movie itself
It oozes S L O W L Y along without much dialog or exposition

For instance, one scene has Kidman climbing a staircase for a full 4 minutes (Yes, I timed it)


There's no dialog or visual exposition, just closeups of the Single Kidman Expression indicating something significant is happening to her character, and shots of her ascending the staircase.There are also shots of freaks intended to be as creepy as possible

In the half hour I survived, there were several shots of an armless woman dusting and drinking tea with her feet, and Kidman's werewolf-like neighbor
These were included without any value to the story or character


So the movie's not just agonizingly boring, it will have you going 'EEEYYEWWWW' a lot, too.As you can probably tell, I'm not a great Kidman fan
I rented this movie because of the rest of the cast

I figured how wrong can you go with Jane Alexander and Robert Downey Jr.? And I found out: You can go this wrong.

$REVIEW.: Goldie Hawn was often so giddy and spaced out in her earliest roles that it bordered on "just too silly", but she is sweet, almost luminous in this role.  It's a chase movie, but it's really not as much a chase as a controlled odessey across Texas in a long gone time.  All major characters perform their tasks well and Ben Johnson has to be the most convincing Chief of Texas State Troopers ever.  Not a deep movie, but great fun to watch.  And Goldie and Atherton evoke real pathos with their plight.  An excellent beginning for one who would become one of our most esteemed directors.

$review_text.: "Kaaterskill Falls" proclaims itself to be low budget from moment the `Low Fi' logo appears on the screen, and it doesn't take long to realize that this film was made on a shoestring by Hollywood standards.  Yet, despite this - or maybe even because of this - there's an intimacy in this film that drew me in and made me feel like a voyeur.  When we meet Ren and Mitch, a sophisticated New York couple driving somewhere in rural Upper New York state in the early spring (the grass is green but the trees are leafless), we are sitting in the back seat of their car struggling to eavesdrop on their plans for the weekend (we later learn that they are "trying to make a baby").  Picking up the hitchhiker, Lyle, doesn't seem like a smart thing to do, especially when he turns out to be rather truculent.  But when Ren and Mitch invite him to stay in their rented cottage, I found myself shouting "Don't do it!"We are present at an improvised dinner that evening with Lyle, Ren, and Mitch.  The presumably unscripted conversation meanders in several not very significant directions. Lyle's big complaint is about the incursion of cell phone towers in his beloved woods; perhaps by extension he laments also the incursion of the cell-phone-bearing city boy, Mitch.  As the evening wears on, stereotypes are broken: the rural Lyle is savvy in the kitchen with Pasta Puttanesca, but fails miserably at making a fire, which the gentrified ex-boy scout, Mitch, gloatingly teaches him to do.  Beyond the words, however, can be sensed the growing attraction between Ren and Lyle, an attraction not lost on Mitch.Surely it cannot have been a case of sloppy movie-making that the next day, when Lyle agrees to lead the couple on a hike to Kaaterskill Falls, the formerly-barren trees are in full leaf?  Can their lush green canopy be a proxy for the unfolding passions of the three characters, long curled up inside tight buds within them?  Symbolic or not, something base and primitive suddenly commandeers the characters' instincts and commands their actions with shocking results.  Or was it all a dream?  Whatever it was, this film stayed with me and kept me pondering for the next twenty-four hours.  And I like a film that makes me think.

$REVIEW.: Basil Rathbone was, quite simply, the best Sherlock Holmes ever, and though some take exception to Nigel Bruce's bumbling portrayal of Watson, the two actors quite obviously both liked and respected one another. The sad thing is that the producers found it necessary to update Holmes into the 1940s and abandoned the original Conan Doyle stories for much less interesting fare. Nevertheless, Rathbone's and Bruce's performances redeem the somewhat lackluster screenplays, so much so that they manage to overcome this defect. Those who love the Rathbone Holmes will want to have the most complete collection extant, and that is it! I already have at least half of these films in various formats, including VHS, but this one offers four films that I did not have, and when I did a price comparison between buying those four separately and purchasing this remarkable collection, I had to go for 'The Complete'. No wonder that I gave it five stars!

$REVIEW.: I adore silly cheesy 80's movies. I've seen hundreds of 'em and while it's embarrassing for me to even admit, this is one of my favourites. Mainly because of the music, the setting, you can feel what the characters feel. Along with being a huge sucker for some romance.From the scene in the bar with "A Million Miles Away" playing, I swear my heart skip a few beats in the perfectness of that scene, to the passing of time as "I'll Melt With You" forever echos in my head as I dream about that 80s bad boy and a simpler time.The plot is lacking a little but it's none the less a great movie. Only real down side I see is the ending. I thought it was pretty silly the first time through. But after a few more times, while it still is, I laugh because it's also kind of sweet.This movie is a strange yet wonderful mixture of everything you'd want in an 80s movie and miss seeing.

$review_text.: Yes, we're talking about 1939!In all honesty, `Beau Geste' is one of the best films I've ever seen.  It is endearing and unforgettable, a film that will suck you in from the very first sequence and truly startle your every sense as it takes you on a beautiful journey through the lives of three brothers.`Beau Geste' tells the story of three orphan boys, Michael, John and Digby, who are taken in by their Aunt Patricia.  The boys are the usual, adventurous type, and they most certainly have a bond that runs deeper than most boys (a bond that is born in the face of adversity).  They boys also have companions in young Isobel, another child Aunt Patricia took heart to adopt, as well as Augustus; Patricia's spoiled son.  Flash forward to adulthood and the boys see that they are falling on hard times.  Patricia has taken it upon herself to see to the children's wellbeing, but it has exhausted her financially and put her in a desperate situation where she is contemplating selling off a precious heirloom, the Blue Water sapphire.  Before she can actually carry that out though, the sapphire mysteriously disappears.Seemingly to run away from the act, the three boys find themselves enlisting in the Foreign Legion, a goal of theirs since childhood.  It is in the evil clutches of Sgt. Markoff that the boys next find themselves; and what comes next is unforgettable.Very few films can actually meld together the maturity of an adult drama with the pure joyfulness of a childish adventure quite like `Beau Geste'.  Every element comes together marvelously; glistening in tone and creating a near perfect (or dare I say `PERFECT') cinematic experience.  The actors are all on point, especially Robert Preston, who just charms and delights as Digby Geste.  With a commanding presence and a lasting impression, `Beau Geste' is marvelous entertainment for all that has all the elements of a Hollywood blockbuster (action, adventure, drama, romance and wit) but actually understands how to make them all fit together beautifully.It is perfectly balanced, from start to finish.

$REVIEW.: The novel of the Chosen is wonderful, but I can never get through watching more than a few minutes of this movie because of the actors chosen for Danny and his own father. Reuven is okay, and his father is well cast, but Danny is really poorly played.  In the book, Danny is haunted by the secrets he is keeping, of his current activities and the hope of his future life. In the movie, Danny appears so self satisfied and complacent, he is annoying rather than compelling and his portrayal makes me wince. I wish they would remake this movie with a different cast.  And in addition, too many of the important points of the book have been left out, and other things brought in that seem irrelevant. And yes, I understand Potok was a consultant on this movie, but I still think they got it wrong.

 Good people in the movie, and maybe it just wasn't my thing

 It was a little scary in regards to the 13-year-old next door


 It ended up alright, but I kept worrying about her safety.

$REVIEW.: While I'm a fan of the horror genre -- enjoying the collective works of George Romero, Takashi Miike, and Rob Zombie's House of a Thousand Corpses and The Devil's Rejects -- I have to say that I'm a bigger fan of that sub-genre known as the psychological thriller. 2009's Paranormal Activity was one of the best examples of this genre that I had seen in quite a while, as its not-quite-documentary quality/low budget look gave the scares in this film an air of reality not present in most modern horror movies. However, given Paramount's initial intentions with Paranormal Activity and the fact that the studio commissioned a sequel before the first movie's run in theaters was over, I have to say that I wasn't too excited at the prospect of seeing a sequel merely a year after the release of its predecessor.Paranormal Activity 2 takes place about two months before the beginning of Paranormal Activity. A year after bringing newborn son Hunter home, Kristi (sister of the first film's Katie) and family experience a break-in, prompting them to install security cameras all over the house. As increasingly bizarre events continue to occur around the house, Kristi's stepdaughter Ali grows curious about what's happening, while Kristi looks back to similar instances that occurred during her and Katie's childhood.In their attempts to profit from the success of the original film, Paramount created a sequel that is close in spirit to the first PA. The resulting film was made for $3 million and still features a completely unknown cast, with the exception of the original leads. Still relying largely on POV cameras, this films also features security camera footage, a brilliant way to feature what's going on in all areas of the house. Seeing exactly what's going on in an unoccupied room, or even outside the house, builds on the suspense the audience feels as we wonder what's going to happen when the family members find themselves in the same room as a spirit entity.Also adding to the eeriness of this film is the presence of innocent players. Watching Hunter, Kristi's one-year-old son, creates a feeling of dread in the audience as we constantly worry about if and when something is going to happen to him. Hunter's presence also creates a greater feeling of empathy toward the family as they struggle to keep him safe. Another innocent player in this thriller is the family's German Shepherd, Abby, who for most of the movie is merely trying to protect Hunter from a perceived threat, and is included in one of the movie's scarier moments. The family dynamic is also more developed in this sequel than in the original film, as there are more players, each with an individualized stance on what exactly is going on in the house.For a movie that was sped into production, the plotting and attention to detail in Paranormal Activity 2 are brilliant. This film acts as both a prequel and sequel, and when you see how the pieces fit together it feels perfectly logical without feeling forced. Fans of the first film will recognize a few references to the original Paranormal Activity that work to further the plot not only of this movie, but the original as well.  The care taken with this plot shows that Paramount and the writers/director chosen to further the PA franchise respected the source material.While the broad plot of Paranormal Activity 2 offers brilliance, some elements of the smaller plot points seem unrealistic and fail to further the plot on a lesser scale. While adding the security camera footage greatly enhances the film, the initial break-in that created a need for the cameras is somehow immediately forgotten by the characters. Logically speaking, it seems that the presence of security cameras would most likely result in a cautious optimism rather than this complete amnesia regarding the initial incident. Also, Ali's research into what's going on the house is presented too late and expounds on the events too quickly. These elements made me miss the more realistic approach of the first movie, in which the characters consult an actual demonologist about the spirit invading their home rather than the internet.I found myself spending more time acquainted with the edge of my seat in this film than I did the first. On at least one occasion I nearly threw my popcorn all over myself, and I've only jumped out of my seat for two other movies that I've seen in theaters. I highly recommend this film. If you're a fan of the original, interested in anything dealing with demonology, or love psychological thrillers, chances are you're going to love this movie!

$REVIEW.: Very amusing and well done comedy of a take on Incredible Shrinking ordeal, and not to be compared with The Incredible Shrinking Man which was a much more realistic sci-fi classic tale
Lily Tomlin shines as does the rest of the crew in this colorful outlook of products and it's chemical compounds gone awry in the body of Pat Kramer who suffers a shrinking disorder to oblivion.Nice little side moral along the way of how anyone, no matter what size, can make a strong valuable difference in the world of caring to make a difference


Funniest parts actually begin toward the last fourth quarter of the movie when it turns its story in the lab, and involves a lab gorilla with the comedic timing of a natural born comic
His status for flipping off the lab scientists is pure comedic pleasure in the primal nature of wanting to do just a thing to the people who tend to manipulate us as lab experiments in the real world

I actually have no beef or comment to make other than this is one of the 80s decade finest with many memorable scenes, including the house maid Concepcion who is outrageous in sterotype, and rhythmic latin dancing in the kitchen, makes us all jump for joy.The addition of seeing it online thanks to Amazon, is also another added plus.

$review_text.: Even if you take into account the fact that it is a mini series it could be edited. Four hours are just too long to keep up the suspence.In the house, various scenes are just repetitive. Although I watched it at night, I was not scared at all! So much for all those creepy creatures that show up.The para-psychologist also gets a little lost in her "research" in the house. In fact, her figure is just pathetic.It is not a bad but far too long and, at times, repetitive movie.There are better ones out there.

$REVIEW.: From the award-winning director of the critically acclaimed anime film "Ghost in the Shell", Momuru Oshii, comes another award-winning tale of heroes that have eternal youth, waging a battle they can barely understand. Based on the novel by Mori Hiroshi and adapted for the screen by Chihiro Ito, Oshii's newest film captures powerful thought-provoking commentary about the evils of war and the price of peace, in a world where corporations wage war and young warriors can be legally murdered. "Sky Crawlers" is a dramatic film that has gorgeous animation and displays fantastic dogfights; and along all this massive commercial appeal and science fiction undertone, the film maintains a soul.There is a war between Lautern and Rostock corporations, and the very real wars are staged within a "theater area". "Kildrens" are fighter pilots bio-engineered to stay young and never to reach adulthood--they are trained to wage furious dogfights above the clouds. A young pilot, Yuichi Kannami only has his childhood memory made up of intense dogfights, and the teenage pilot struggles with the fragmented feelings of a lost past. When his beautiful commanding officer Suito Kusanagi (voiced by Rinko Kikuchi) refuses to disclose information on the fate of the pilot that Yuichi is replacing, added to the fact that the new plane he is now using is in such pristine condition, Yuichi's curiosity threatens to take hold of him.Momuru Oshii once again succeeds in bringing his audience to a world where wars are waged without the innocent casualties, but it still results in the loss of innocence and the price of peace may still be too high a price to pay. Oshii brings powerful commentary about the necessities of war, that misery may be necessary to sustain peace so that society can have the illusion of order. The way the film is structured is excellent as Oshii slowly but methodically brings us to understand this surreal world. It is curious that the time and place is almost unspecified, but I think it would be safe to assume that this is a futuristic world, a near dystopian post apocalyptic future because of the advances in bio-engineering. However, it is also quite curious that this world would use "propeller-driven" aircraft with designs that looked very advance; it is an odd mixing of future and past tech, this was intentionally meant to emulate this world's past history of bloody wars and that nuclear weapons should be kept out of the picture.This world uses young warriors to fight their wars, and these pilots are ones with no family and little memories of their past. The film revolves around the relationship between Kusanagi and Kannami, the mysteries of their past life that carries a lot of effective dramatic elements that is the film's main showstopper. Questions such as; when can human experiences prove more than enough? Just how much can one strong individual bear before they can begin to break down? Oshii brings a very dark vision as to how this world can use these human beings to almost fight forever, whose existence can only be ended when they are killed. Oshii brings a true emotional experience, as the viewer is slowly brought to the lives of Kusanagi and Kannami. The direction is powerful and enthralling enough to keep the viewer absorbed in its human drama. I cannot reveal anymore without spoiling the film, but I can tell you this much, the twist and turns in the film's structure are touching, surprisingly outstanding in the manner that it plays the plot's key elements.The characters in "Sky Crawlers" feel very real, and you can easily make an attachment to them. The most interesting character of all would have to be Suito Kusanagi (curiously carries a strong resemblance to the major in Ghost in the Shell), and most of the film's burden falls on her. Mitsuya (voiced by Chiaki Kuriyama) didn't show up until the film's third act, but the significance of her character is beautifully played by Oshii. The animation is a blend of 3-D graphics and it seems to me that the only 2-D animation rendered may be the characters. Some may feel the simplicity on the characters' rendition may be a little out of place but I rather liked the fact that the animation helmed by Nishikubo Toshihiko was kept grounded and a little restrained. I would not like an overload of special effects to overshadow exactly what the film is trying to say. Yes, the film is an emotionally driven melodrama, with nicely placed sequences of dogfights ONLY to keep it interesting; but the aerial battles aren't the film's main draw. Those looking for fast-paced action are better off looking elsewhere.The film isn't perfect though, as it doesn't really draw upon the stakes as to why this war is being fought. The corporations lacked (ahem) development, and the life outside the lives of our squadron are only hinted at and never truly fleshed out. Besides some minor plot limitations imposed by itself, the film does remain strong in its brilliant simplicity. I liked the mysterious "Teacher" in a plane with a "black jaguar" in its nose, I was reminded of the "Red Baron" in World War One--a supposedly ace pilot that any encounter with him may mean certain death. It added a certain different air of mystery, although some parts felt a little forced; but it doesn`t really hurt the movie. This is also NOT your children's anime film, as besides its darkly thought-provoking premise, there are hinted at sex and mild nudity. This film is rightfully rated PG-13."Sky Crawlers" may have a somewhat bizarre title, but believe me when I say that this anime film is very much worth a spin. Much like Oshii's "Ghost in the Shell", the film manages to find a soul, with a well-structured story that hits all the right spots. Remarkably simple, and astonishingly thought-provoking, the film manages to instill our emotions. During these times, it makes us wonder what exactly are the young men and women are sacrificing to safeguard peace and order. Just how exactly can war affect an individual? Would each kill affect their soul? When is enough is enough?Highly Recommended! [4  Stars]

$review_text.: For the 26th installment of the cult classic show "Mystery Science Theater 3000", Shout Factory has given us the fans 4 more episodes from Seasons 4, 5, 6 and the opening Sci-Fi era season 8.-Episode 411, "Magic Sword": Here we have famed and cannon fodder ridden director Bert I. Gordon whose films have been riffed on this show in the past seasons ("King Dinosaur", "The Amazing Colossal Man", "War of the Colossal Beast", "Earth Vs. The Spider"), a few episodes came "Tormented", Season 5 gave us "Begining of the End". All of his films were usually made very cheap and a lot of them featured oversized monsters, cheap sets and were generally cheaply made all around.This offering is called "Magic Sword" which takes some goofy medival theme cliches and makes a story featuring a princess, wizardry, a young man who must become a hero and save the princess from harm and bring peace to the kingdom. Since this is aimed at kids obviously, it's a fairly breezy and at times childish and the main monster featured is a fairly decent looking dragon. For a Joel episode its pretty decent, whimsy and goes by pretty quickly, the riffs are good for the most part, so it's worth a look.-Episode 516, "Alien From L.A.": Here Kathy Ireland is the daughter of an archaeologist who goes deep below the Earth's surface to find him and finds a race of sub creatures who believe there world is the only one. Sound a bit like "Journey To The Center of The Earth"? Well it basically is and it's one bad flick, the whole underground city theme is just cheesy as you know what, the effects are terrible, the story just bad and Kathy while very attractive is a terrible actress. Mike and the bots do a good job here as this junk is perfect material for them.-Episode 620, "Danger! Death Ray": Of course a death ray would only be used for peaceful purposes so the maker of it surely didn't need to tell the viewers that. This is one of the many, many James Bond knock offs that Italy and other European countries did in an attempt to cash in on the huge success of the Bond flicks. Also the main actor is a former "Tarzan" who plays an agent named Bart Fargo and the silliness and goofiness of this Bond knock off is entertaining enough by itself. Mike and the bots do a good job with this one.-Episode 803, "The Mole People": John Agar ("Revenge of the Creature") finds a lost civilization in the Earth that has enslaved a race of mole people to do their bidding. There's the expected cheap sets, "action" scenes, romance, the mole people and their captors are just laughably cheap and silly looking. It's pretty bad, bland and is perfect stuff for the MST3K crew. It's easily one of my favorites as they just get more vicious with their riffs as the movie goes on.Bonus Features-Interview with "Magic Sword" director Bert I. Gordon: Not a bad interview, but fairly short, he at least seems gracious in how he has achieved fame in filmmaking.-Interview with "Alien From L.A." director Albert Pyun, pretty good piece here but short one. He does tell some good stories about how the production of the movie was difficult and how working with Kathy Ireland was interesting to say the least.-Life After MST3K, Mike Nelson: We hear from the man who took over for Joel Hodgson in Season 5 as the lead on MST3K. Good stuff here as Mike is one of my favorites from the show.-Of Mushroom and Madmen-Making The Mole People: Good stuff here too, very cool piece that shows how the movie was made very cheaply.-Also including theatrical trailers and MST Hour Wraps.This is a pretty good set, my favorite is "The Mole People" as the guys were really on their game with that one.

$review_text.: The topic of trains is one of great interest despite the poor state of US railroads with the legend and the logic of railroads is a permanent part  of US history. What would DC be without the Metro or Chicago without the 'L"? This series while well intended and at times interesting is nothing if not reminiscent of the faux sports competition of various Gordon Ramsey kitchen projects or the numerous team sports on the Food Channel. The most positive to be said about the presenter is that at least he is confined to Maine and will not be sitting next to me on a flight.The topic has great potential but its presentation as "We've got to get this train of produce to Schenectady by x hours" as if the train were not running on a 365/24/7 schedule is inane - as if "We" including the presenter were a help and not a hinderance. A richness of subject matter and scenery is subsumed by moronic chit chat (or is that chit chat by a moron?) and superficiality. Amtrak's Acela is not even close to being among the world's fastest (or reliable) trains given the poor infrastructure, the freight trains are par for the  course with France and Germany equal in every respect except the latter don't derail as often. The program ignores the rich history of the stations (hey let's go to the rodeo in Cheyenne instead!!), the scenery, the fascinating history and technology of the infrastructure support (yes there is some but the commentary is by the idiot commentator - "isn't this great" not by the experts who as one reviewer noted appear to either cringe or ignore Mr. Matt). the future role of the railroad in the US - if the funding doesn't end up with the vampire squids in NYC etc. etc. Imagine the BBC or PBS doing this series - it would be sublime. There's still room.

$REVIEW.: I was first introduced to the whole idea of these two-parter episodes being released as stand-alone movies when I was fortunate enough to find out that &#8220;The Best of Both Worlds&#8221; was going to play in theaters for a one day showing on April 25th. I always loved TBOBW above every other episode. I felt it was a combination of an outstanding story, acting and a wonderful creepy score by Ron Jones. So to get a chance to see it on the big screen was a dream come true. I find after buying and watching TBOBW I am seeing it in a whole new light (not only the outstanding work done in restoration) but it really does feel like watching a movie.  I got my copy of Redemption yesterday and simply loved it. I guess I&#8217;m a gluten of punishment because I am also buying each season on blu-ray (replacing my old collection). I only hope (as another reviewer stated) that Paramount decides to release the remaining two-parter episodes in the same fashion. The remaining being Unification, Time's Arrow, Chain of Command, Birthright, Descent and Gambit....

$review_text.: I can't think of any other word; at the end of this, I was at my wits end and sitting on the floor, shaking; it was like nothing I could recall at all.Except for that one time I had been to Straford and seen Shakespeare performed one wonderful day in 1977; Macbeth; and I sat there and trembled and the world caught fire and my English teacher looked at me and he would have been pleased; I never saw anything the same way again, I swear.The first hint that something remarkable might have been going on came, strangely, some four months before the series started to go on air. It was on the radio, a series, called, I think, Face to Face, and it kicked off with, of all people, Catherine Tate and David and it was very funny, but in all of this (and I parked in a layby to hear it properly) there was a very real hidden layer; these two had been close; there was a kind of quietness and fire and the feeling of tremendous latent energy between them that you only get after something very big has happened; and I knew then that something was most definitely up.Billy piper then stated for the record, something very curious; you'll see the ending, she said, .. and you will cry. You will.What on earth this was supposed to say to us all, at that time I could not fathom. It was the most cryptic and strange thing imaginable; and yet now, well, it makes sense because, in fact I did; and it was the most astonishing thing I have ever seen on television or anywhere else...The first episode seemed lightweight until the ending minute; and my son (who was 21 then) sat back, open mouthed. WHAT?He got up, ran to the kitchen, and ran back, paced up and down and then ran back to the kitchen. I was puzzled but it was growing on me, too.We played it back. The same thing happened. This time we both went nuts. after a long time Simon said, in a slow voice "That's it. "They did it.""What?""THAT " he said, almost shaking from the effort, "THAT was the scariest thing I have ever seen. EVER!"Oh yes; I should say so.And done with a single look; one camera shot; and there you were."WHAT IS GOING ON?"... We just gawped.The thing teased us through 13 weeks. four months in which I turned from being kind of intrigued into virtually a nervous wreck.There were times when I wanted to turn up on his doorstep and personally give Bernard Cribbins an OBE; the man gives an absolutely stunning, amazing performance which perhaps is not performance at all, but the same man who gave us the Railway Children somehow simply presented as himself; then there was Midnight; a piece that was so chilling that I could not sleep that night; and then...Well, after this, you would have gone barmy. The last (is it four?) episodes are so brilliant that I should have just given up and taken those weeks off. I was no good at anything.The internet became a trap. It was strange; several rumours about the ending of the series multiplied across those weeks and by the time I had gotten halfway trough these last few stories, it had kind of converged to one quite credible theory that was actually very well fleshed out; my heart was just about in my boots. It was going to end in complete disaster, and that was going to be the end of it all. It was going to self destruct; and that was the awful portentious feeling that I had picked up on that quiet night, listening to the radio.But it was not so.In fact, this sequence of stories is a masterpiece; a single, unrepeatable, virtuoso act of writing, acting, editing, and composing that has the most wonderful ending you could ever imagine.Last series saw the whole of New New York sing the Old Rugged Cross; here we had an utterly alien race delivered from slavery and degradation; who lift their hands up and give thanks and sing something that sounds like a hymn of praise; If you heard this at the Proms you will know why so many people found tears in their eyes at this; All I thought about was those words "In my fathers house are many mansions", and how Heaven must contain so much more than we could possibly know about, and how great and majestic the fellowship of the saints must surely be with a galaxy this size; I had suspected this ever since I was young enough to understand that there was little contradiction between what I knew from Sunday school and the what I was learning from The Sky at Night; I was greatly moved by all of this and I still am.And the end of the thing is preposterous and wonderful, and unbelievably moving and almost certainly has a kitchen sink or two for good measure. It's half Doctor Who, half Peter Pan and half Charles Wesley for all I know. Make sure that you are not too far from a fairly large sofa, folks. And you better get some tissues, because you may find that Billy Piper was quite right.

Though the cast as a whole is fairly distinguished and the script well written, it's Ritter's performance that makes this comedy worth watching.

$review_text.: ...in the hand of thy G-d.  Isaiah 62:3And "The Queen"'s a royal movie to place in your DVD player.A royalist I've slowly become.  G-d Save the Queen!  And all that.  In Great Britain, the Queen is a constitutional monarch of a country without a written constitution, yet America's rightful authors and originators of its ideals were probably nameless Anglican professors at King's College, which is now called Columbia University in New York City.  They were probably royalists too, no doubt.When I saw that the movie's plot would have a lot to do with Princess Diana's death a few years back, I thought I wouldn't like the movie very much, the movie entitled "The Queen" should be about The Queen and no one else.  The movie thankfully lives up to its name.  Despite my preconceived notions, I've watched this twice already and think it has not only entertainment value but educational and historical value as well.One of America's forefathers said,  "A man of real merit is never seen in so favorable a light as through the medium of adversity."  In this movie, the Queen's adverse circumstances were republican/anti-monarchical forces at work which probably in reality used Princess Diana as a pawn in their game.  I think her brother, Earl Spencer got it right when he said the Press killed her.  My favorite scene in this film was the one with the little girl giving Queen Elizabeth some flowers as the Royal family stopped to read the multitude of notes left among the sea of flowers outside the gates of Buckingham Palace.  This movie also portrays the Queen's relationship with her tenth Prime Minister Tony Blair as being a dynamic one which energized, transformed the monarchy into its present state.Watch also the video clip of Helen Mirren.  I also was sceptical of what she could say, but was pleasantly surprised.  She deserved the Award for Best Actress, and I do agree the movie and other actors deserve kudos as well.  I personally would not mind having this movie among my worldy goods...The gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory...Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy G-d.

$REVIEW.: This war film features a battle of wits between an American destroyer captain (Robert Mitchum) and a U-Boat commander (Curt Jurgens).  These two fine actors, at the top of their form, offer an engrossing and suspenseful tale of two men who are quite alike in spite of being on opposite sides in war.

$REVIEW.: From the first minute to the very last Precious is a confronting film. The narrative contains abuse, incest, and poverty, yet amongst all this utter misfortune is a young women named Precious who wants to make the best of her life. She often uses daydreams to escape the harsh realities of her being, and she has a warm good nature. A scene in the movie that is priceless is when Precious introduces John the male nurse (Lenny Kravitz) to the school receptionist, who is constantly frustrated by relationships, and she drops the phone the moment she lays eyes on John. But make no mistake this is a hard hitting film with no rainbows.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

$REVIEW.: Any movie released by Criterion is worth owning: even if you're not familiar with the film or it's not a favorite, they're sure to include so many valuable extras that you'll get your money's worth and appreciate the film's significance as time passes on


Il Generale Della Rovere ($29.95; Criterion) is a Roberto Rosselini film starring director Vittorio De Sica (I'm always surprised when he acts but De Sica acted in hundreds of movies)


De Sica plays a con man forced by the Nazis to impersonate a general and get info from Italian prisoners
For the first time, the bum feels a twinge of conscience
Extras include interviews and a visual essay

$REVIEW.: *** This review may contain spoilers ***'In a World...' refers to the clich&eacute;d opening line in countless movie trailers performed by the master of voice-over artists, Don LaFontaine, who died in 2008. Whether LaFontaine himself would have liked 'In a World...' (the movie), a comedy about the voice-over movie trailer industry, is a matter of conjecture. Certainly it's an original concept but does it sustain itself over the entire 93 minute running time?'In a World...' derives most of its humor from a new trend in American comedy: the observation of the passive-aggressive type. Not unlike such independent films as 'Cyrus' or the mainstream hit, 'Bridesmaids', the passive-character constantly is unable to say 'no' and is so afraid of displeasing others, that they constantly cave into the demands of those who they actually dislike. Often these passive-aggressive types will express their true-feelings of disdain in front of the person they ultimately give in to.A prime example of this type of behavior is illustrated by the actions of the 'In a World...' protagonist, Carol Solomon (Lake Bell), who is an up and coming voice-over artist, who happens to be the daughter of the voice-over industry darling, Sam (played by the well-known, real-life voice-over artist, Fred Melamed). After Sam makes it clear she can't live with him anymore, Carol moves in with her sister, Dani, a hotel concierge.The main plot concerns Carol and Sam competing for a big voice-over job for the new 'Amazon Games' movie trailer (a slightly amusing take-off on the 'Hunger Games'). Carol is a classic passive-aggressive type who can't say no. Despite her disdain for Gustav, her sleazy voice-over rival, she ends up staying the night with him after attending Gustav's raucous party.There's a subplot involving Carol's passive-aggressive sister, Dani, who can't say no to Carol, when she wants him to tape a handsome Irish flirt at the hotel for her special 'voice archive'. When Dani's husband Moe, accidentally comes across the tape, he assumes Dani is actually making a play for the Irishman at the hotel and decides to leave her. You can probably guess that the now estranged couple, eventually reconcile.When Carol actually ends up winning the job for the 'Amazon Games', her father throws a hissy fit at the awards ceremony where he refuses to acknowledge that Carol actually earned the job fair and square. Only through the intervention of his sagacious younger girlfriend, Jamie, does Sam finally see the light and end up acknowledging both daughters for their talent, love and support. Carol seems to find love herself with the incredibly nerdy Louis, her recording engineer, and finally probably realizes better to end up with an equal (than an opposite, like Gustav).'In a World...' never really rises above the level of sit-com humor. The characters are modeled on these passive-aggressive types, who thrive on repeating the same kind of self-deprecating jokes, ad infinitum. There is some gentle ribbing of the movie trailer industry which occasionally is amusing, but ultimately there are few laughs here at all. Better to watch the movie trailers themselves than this light weight, formulaic put-down.

$review_text.: The recent success ofSeabiscuit: An American Legendand the movieSeabiscuit (Widescreen Edition)made from it should create an interest in this fictionalized retelling of the story of one of racing's most unexpected champions, but there isn't really much in it about the horse: mostly it's the story of Shawn O'Hara (Barry Fitzgerald), the Irish trainer who comes to the United States to work at Thomas Milford's (William Forrest) Kentucky farm and sees in the "little horse with the big knees" a potential no one else can find, and of Shawn's niece Margaret (Shirley Temple), whose grief over the death of her brother in a racing accident in England almost destroys her romance with the jockey Ted Knowles (Lon McCallister).  Temple, who tried throughout the '40's to move from child star to serious adult actress, does a reasonable job in the role, but it's Fitzgerald who steals the movie.

$review_text.: This is that rare thing! A sequel that's better than the original (although it's not &quot;really&quot; a sequel in any of the characters from the Lock, Stock &amp; You Know The Rest).Ritchie's maybe employing the same formula and some may argue &quot;Snatch&quot; offers nothing new, but same can be said for certain George Lucas and his original Star Wars trilogy, or F.F. Coppola's Godfather epic. My answer is the same for all: &quot;Why change something that works?&quot; At least until it becomes a boring routine, which this is not (yet).The story involves fixing illegal boxing matches, diamond heist and sumggling and then it gets complicated (in a goody good way).Characters are so comic (in both meaning of the word), dialogues sharp and funny and directing is stylish and fast-paced.There are so many good special features on this DVD, but the best has to be parallel viewing of the storyboards and the final cut of the movie, which can really help anyone who wants to see how te movie is made...

$REVIEW.: I always enjoy the movies written and/or directed by the Coen Brothers.  This was based on the book (same name) by Cormack McCarthy which I've read numerous times.  It's a great story with only few characters and the movie stays very close to the book.  That in itself is refreshing since it doesn't often happen.  The actors are perfect for their characters.  There's a fair amount of violence as the villain is one evil dude.  However, I didn't think it was over done for shock value, just real.

What was going on? Well, once it all became crystal clear the only satisfaction to be gained was from having the puzzle solved

$REVIEW.: I'll save anyone reading my review the repitious unsatisfactory comments mentioned by other reviewers. I'll just say that I agree with them all. We have at least ten of the Wiggles videos and a few CD's- all are satisfactory or outstanding ( we do not have the theater release one). What a disappointment this new video was for me. But, this is not who the video is intended for is it! So, the $... question is---what did my kids think of it. Well, seeing how they were strapped into their carseats eating McDonalds junk food as they watched this video for the first time they were totally satisfied and not going anywhere! My one child did want to watch it again as soon as it was over and also it was the first thing he requested upon waking from his nap. So, will I be listening to this sickly "Love Boat" / "Don't Worry Be Happy" cabana type dribble anymore? Chances are, if you give your kids a new Wiggles video, they're going to want to watch it again and again! I'd rather have to wait longer for new Wiggles videos than get bogus, thrown together , cheap-o productions like this one.

Ground breaking in somany ways.  This film not only predicted the feminist movement by amile it also plays on the communist themed witch-hunt if you reallywant to read into it.  Dispite it's title, Joan Crawford plays leadit this stagebrush saga of two desparate women trying to hold on tothe only man who meant something in their lives. And what a cast ofstars! Sterling Hayden as Johnny, Ward Bond, Ernest Borgnine, ScottBrady and of course Mercedes McCambridge as the &quot;other woman&quot; and I must say Technicolor never looked better in a western,I countedat least six shades of red in Crawford's lipstick alone.

$REVIEW.: There was a point - original, madly creative, sometimes poignant and always amusing to Scrubs in previous seasons - alas; the deep well of comic mojo can definitely be diagnosed as having gone dry in the final season. Farewell - and so passes the glory that was. Mind you, there are still flashes of wit, and a collection of new med-school students floundering their way through relations personal, medical and scholastic  . . .  but it all seems perfunctory, as if they had just reworked scenes from old scripts. A handful of the old regulars, notably the irascible Dr. Cox and the former sidekick Turk (John C. McGinley and Donald Faison) are still hanging in, but in an enervated fashion, as if they are just going through the motions. Possibly the show might have been workable, if more of the new faces had been introduced and the old ones phased out gradually, but season 9 starts abruptly and then ends even more abruptly. It's as if the plug was pulled between one week and the next. It seems as if the show really ended very satisfactorily at the end of Season 8, but carried on with a few bitter-enders and then lost interest all together after half a season when it became apparent that the lightening could not be caught in the jar once more time.The extras are perfunctory - the funniest is about the golf cart.

$REVIEW.: I would have to agree with the reviewer who said that they should be called Celtic Breeze instead; Heartland, the first song, is the only really "thunderous" track.  These guys are extremely talented, and have a nice eye candy factor, too.  Paul especially has a gorgeous tenor voice.  Just like Celtic Woman, songs range from pop to semi-classical to folk, although I would say the concert has more pop than anything.  They sing so well that even the cheesy choreography and over-produced set don't ruin their performances.  Heartland, however, is performed eerily like Stonehenge from This is Spinal Tap (check it out on Youtube to see what I mean).  As much as I enjoy this concert, I would have to say that I've enjoyed The High Kings dvd I bought much more, as they play more traditional music.

It just might be overwhelming for those who aren't accustomed to nonstop mayhem and sorrow

The devil isnt shown till the end in the directors cut which makes for more suspense. Plus the US musical score was down right cheezy with 80s synth pop dubbed over. As for Tom Cruise, he's the worst part of the movie (as goes with any of his movies ). Tim Curry is whats makes this film shine. It would be interested to see what this movie would look like if Ridley Scott had done this in the 90s??

The singing was great, and it did have some classic Psych humor, but because of the clips and the fact that it was a musical we expected a Christmas episode in the usual light, Psych fashion
The music did help lighten the mood, but the plot was closer to one of the more dark episodes they have

Overall, we decided that we will probably enjoy it much more 2nd time around, now that we don't have such high expectations
Also, I wish you could rent these episodes, like you can some movies instead of having to purchase them.

$REVIEW.: Sometimes American television can be downright boring. When there is a night of 120 channels of nothing, grab this dvd and prepare to be emotionally involved. As a general rule, I am not a fan of anthologies.but this series is terrific. The viewer comes to know the residents of the row houses on the street and come to care deeply about them. These are 'everyday' folk and the viewer comes to realize quickly that these characters have much to tell us about ourselves. What I think is important to note is that while all are good, some will resonate differently with each viewer.  My favorite episodes will not necessarily be yours but you will still enjoy them.  The accents are thick and I wish there were subtitles, yet I did not feel the lack of them interfered with my enjoyment. I am hoping that there is a season 2 in the future.  Highly recommended.

$review_text.: While many people claim that Season Two is the best season ever of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I favor Season Three instead

It features the introduction of fan favorites Eliza Dushku (as Faith, a renegade Slayer) and Emma Caulfield (as Anya, former "patron saint" of scorned women) as well as a keeps-you-guessing storyline


Season Three is also the most consistent season - there are no "stinker" episodes like Season Two's "Bad Eggs" or Season Four's "Beer Bad."This set contains all 22 episodes of the first season


They are:"Anne" - After sending Angel to hell at the end of the previous Season, Buffy has run to L.A

and changed her name, abandoning her Slayer responsibilities


But when someone she's previously helped recognizes her and asks for her aid again, can she refuse?"Dead Man's Party" - Buffy's back, but not all is right
She's still expelled from school, and her friends have some serious repressed anger that's just waiting to burst out
And then there's the zombies that crash her "welcome home" party..."Faith, Hope and Trick" - Eliza Dushku (Bring It On) appears as sexy new Slayer Faith, whose camaraderie with Buffy's friends makes her a bit jealous

It also features the introduction of Mr
Trick, one of the funnier (and one of the few black) characters to appear on Buffy."Beauty and the Beasts" - Angel's back from Hell slightly feral and werewolf Oz may have been getting out of his cage during the full moon

When there's a series of brutal murders, Buffy and Willow have to consider the possibility that one of their boyfriends is the culprit."Homecoming" - One of the funniest episodes of Buffy ever, along with "Doppelgangland" (see below)


Buffy and Cordelia are in a no-holds-barred race to become Homecoming Queen

But they're soon in big trouble when Homecoming coincides with Mr
Trick's new big game event, Slayerfest '98."Band Candy" - Another hysterically funny episode, in which a batch of magically enhanced candy makes all the adults in Sunnydale act like irresponsible teenagers - including Giles and Buffy's mother Joyce."Revelations" - The Scooby Gang has found out about Angel's return, and are not happy with Buffy for keeping it a secret
And Faith's new Watcher, Gwendolyn Post, arrives in Sunnydale."Lover's Walk" - James Marsters returns as a lovelorn Spike, who's lost Drusilla to a Chaos Demon

When he kidnaps Willow and Xander, and forces Buffy and Angel to work together with him, you know badness is going to ensue...and it does in a heartbreaking conclusion."The Wish" - Enraged by Xander's betrayal and her social ostracism, Cordelia wishes that Buffy had never come to Sunnydale
Little does she know that vengeance demon Anya (Emma Caulfield) is there to make it come true


Suddenly she finds herself in a world where Willow and Xander are vampires and the Master rules Sunnydale after dark."Amends" - When the ghosts of Angel's past victims appear to torment him, Buffy must find out what is doing this


Also, Willow and Oz reconcile."Gingerbread" - When Joyce finds two children's bodies, apparently killed by witches, the town gears up for a massive witch hunt


Buffy and Willow find themselves caught in the middle of it."Helpless" - On her eighteenth birthday, Buffy finds herself losing her Slayer powers


When her mother is kidnapped by a psychotic vampire unleashed by the Watcher's Council, Buffy must save her armed with only her wits."The Zeppo" - While Buffy and co
stave off yet another apocalypse, Xander finds himself hanging out with a bunch of zombies, saving the school from being blown up, and...losing his virginity!?"Bad Girls" - New Watcher Wesley Wyndham-Pryce makes his appearance, and Faith shows Buffy a walk on the wild side that ends in tragedy."Consequences" - After the deputy mayor's death, Buffy and Faith find themselves feeling trapped and scared

Faith takes a decided turn for the worse, and joins forces with the cheerfully evil Mayor of Sunnydale."Doppelgangland" - A spell performed by Willow and Anya brings Vampire Willow from the world of "The Wish" (see above) to normal Sunnydale


Hysterically funny; the highlight has to be when Willow masquerades as Vampire Willow."Enemies" - Faith shows her true colors when she and the Mayor ask a demon to remove Angel's soul, returning him to the soulless vampire Angelus."Earshot" - Buffy gains telepathy after killing a demon, and hears a death threat aimed at the school's students


Unfortunately, the ability to hear others' minds is slowly driving her insane."Choices" - The Box of Gavrok, an item essential to the Mayor's Ascension, arrives in Sunnydale


The Scoobies manage to capture it, but in the process Willow is kidnapped

$review_text.: A group of college kids at an abandoned house pull a prank that sets loose a murderous ghost.There's something strange, these days and in the past, that often happens to stars of major horror films. After their success, even if their fame is not at an end, they will star in random paycheck movies simply because they're asked, regardless of the quality of the film. Buried Alive is that paycheck for Saw-series star Tobin Bell (Jigsaw). When it comes to a straight-to-video slasher film like this (especially one marketed by the usually trustworthy Dimension Extreme), there are certain things horror fans have come to expect: Heavy gore, attractive women (who, most often, take off their clothes), and, at the very least, some entertainment. Unfortunately, even on as 'unrated,' the film does not deliver on the blood & guts. There is some violence, but not enough, and the result of the violence doesn't have enough splatter. The women are attractive, so they did deliver to us the eye candy. And, as far as entertainment and enjoyment go, well. . . it varied. At some points, the film is a good time and worth a few laughs. Other times, however, the film turns into a bit of a slow-drag bore (especially during the sorority stuff). From the plot to the effects, there's nothing here that hasn't been seen dozens of times before, so if you're in need of some predictability with a bit of enjoyability, you might want to check this out. . . but, you can do a whole lot better.Final verdict: 4/10.-AP3-
$SUMMARY.: Some good fun, but not enough to make it worth it.

$REVIEW.: Now keep in mind I was born in '86 and I watched this movie when I was in my mid single digits.  So about twenty years now I've thought about this movie and wanted to see it again.  It was one of those bittersweet memories that grew foggier throughout the years and the only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 was because of the ending of the movie, which is not the merchant's fault.  I got this DVD quickly (but I do have Prime membership), the packaging was satisfactory, and I have no complaints as far as the merchant's end of the transaction.Story: Little did I know Marisa Tomei starred in this teen romance after her performance in &#34;My Cousin Vinny&#34; and she gives a surreal portrayal here as a waitress who is sexually assaulted by old acquaintances of hers.  That moment of &#34;fight or flight&#34; arises in the story that too many women have tragically been subject to, and Christian Slater plays the hero, Adam, who comes to her rescue.  His backstory helps fuel the romance, and it leads up to the ultimately tragic, tear-jerking ending.  It's sad to watch because you just want her to find happiness, but it's a bittersweet gem of a story you'll remember for years to come.

$review_text.: After seeing all the comments, here and in the press, about this being a mean and disturbing portrayal of Margaret Thatcher, I found it to be quite the opposite


This was a moving and warm mini-biography that really only touched skippingly on the Thatcherite philosphy, its effects and lasting consequences for the UK


Those who agree with the boldly stated Conservative mantra will, presumably, be upset that Margaret Thatcher was portrayed as an ambitious woman who had failings but achieved highest office though finally, after 11 fairly successful years, was a failed politician due to being unable to see the reality of going too far.

$review_text.: Ok so I couldn't sit through the entire thing. Only watched some of it, and all I can say is thank god Steven Spielgerb remade this film. Munich is one of those films I have seen many times. It's very realistic, graphic, tense, well acted, and one of the very best political thriller I have ever seen along with The Baader Mienhof Complex, which was about Germany's Red Army Faction, which is equally as good as Munich. This film started out pretty hokey. While I agree that would be expected for a TV film made in the mid 80's it's simply a bit too cheesy even by 80's TV movie standards. Now I really like Steven Bauer, but I kept expected to hear hom doing a Cuban accent because I have seen Scarface too many times I guess. He seems too squeeky clean and his acting here feels almost like soap opera territory. The action in the begining was pretty tacky, and so the film progressed rather weakly till I gave up on it. If you haven't seen Munich I highyl recommed it because it's pretty faithful to the book and simply riveting and suspensful. Another interesting fact is watch for Leslie Hope, who I think played Jack Bauer's wife in season I of 24, if your a fan of the show. Here she is very young, probably early 20's. Like I said I didn't watch this whole film, so take that into consideration. But I felt it was rather weak compared to Munich, and it is also worth mentioning that the transfer quality of this film here on Nflix is pretty poor, about equal with VHS.

$REVIEW.: I rate this film 6 stars out of 5.  The effects and action sequences are dazzling!  (For comparison, Episode I deserves 4 stars overall, at the most.)The Star Wars universe compares very favorably with any mythologies or fantasies I know, including JRR Tolkien's.  I'd indeed argue that Lucas's double trilogy is much bigger and far more interesting than all of Tolkien's books combined.  And the movies are also one level above anything contrived by Peter Jackson (although his films are entertaining in their own right).  I'd bet that if Tolkien were alive today to see Lucas's films, he'd be swept off his feet (or fall off his seat).  To combine grand mythology, science fiction, morality tale, and psychological drama in this perfectly balanced brew is too much for anyone even with Tolkien's brilliance to beat.  And the special effects are just state-of-the-art!  Shakespeare may have been the hottest writer in Elizabethan times, but Lucas is the greatest creative, artistic genius alive today.

Luke became a marked man.He rushed home to whisk his wife away, but the Russian mob got to her first. They warned him that anyone he talked to were also marked. Depressed, he contemplates suicide on the edge of the subway until he sees a scared little girl out of the corner of his eye.Mei has a knack for numbers. She is discovered by the Triads and used to memorize a code. The Russian mob tries to kidnap her but Mei manages to escape everyone and tries to disappear into the subway.Safe has a great storyline with good twists and well developed characters. I think they did an especially good job of showing the contrast between how Luke interacted with the dirty cops and mobsters and how he interacted with Mei.

$review_text.: Joan Rivers wrote a new book last year which was funny. Lots of white space and a story to offend nearly everyone. But- if you know what you are getting in for, it can be enjoyable. For years Rivers built her routine around her late husband Edgar. Sure she used four letter words but the point of her humor was actually funny.Now approaching 80 years old, Rivers is going for shock humor. Not even insult humor like Don Rickels is known for. Not only does she consider herself an "equal opportunity offender" but, based on this 69 minute performance at a theater in St. Charles, Illinois, -a theater with her name emblazoned all over the walls - she presents herself as so horny that she needs sex all the time.After telling jokes to offend, old people (herself excluded of course), Africans-Americans, Asians and lesbians (she does love gay men and - from the reaction and audience shots - with only men in the first two rows - this is now a prime audience for her) she talks female body parts. Trust me; this is more verabally graphic than a discussion with a gynecologist.When it looks like she cannot go any deeper into trying to offend someone, Rivers stoops as low as possible when she tries to make fun of - what else? - the holocaust. (No not the way Mel Brooks does it. In fact, even this audience reacts in silence when she gets this low.)I like funny comedians - and comediennes - and can certainly take strong language (nearly every phrase from Rivers mouth contains a word beginning with the letter F), though it shouldn't be requisite, but I found little to laugh here.There are already two reviews (giving 5 stars to this DVD) here before me., including fellow Amazon reviewer K. Harris, who I generally agree with. My rating is based on the laughter - or, rather lack of it - that I found watching this and sometimes embarrassment I felt for Rivers, having to stoop as low as she does here. So if you are a true Rivers fan, you'll probably like it, but be aware that the language is graphic and the humor is mean spirited.Note that there are no special features on the DVD.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm"Anything Phonographic"

$review_text.: The first mummy flick is unique among classic horror movies.  The Egyptian tale has the dark and moody look of Teutonic art.  True to his cinematographer background, director Karl Freund emphasizes presentation over shock value.  Instead of nail-biting suspense, terror slowly develops.  Unlike subsequent mummies who shuffled around covered in moldy Ace bandages, Im-ho-tep (Boris Karloff) only briefly appears in this attire.  After his terrifying resurrection scene, Karloff sheds the bandages, and poses as Ardath Bey, an expert in ancient Egypt.  His skin is parchment dry, and his eyes glow with supernatural intensity.  He is evil incarnate.  Executed 3700 years ago for vile sacrilege, he rises from the dead after the desecration of the sacred ruins.  Im-ho-tep seeks to contact the spirit of his forbidden love, Princess Akes-se-namun (sp.?).  He finds a woman (Zita Talbot) in modern day Egypt, and believes she is the reincarnated princess.  Im-ho-tep has mesmerizing power.  He bends the Nubian servant (the stony faced Noble Johnson) into a willing slave.  The ancient blood prevails.  Im-ho-tep beckons and the princess can only submit.  Edward Van Sloan plays the academic type that understands Im-ho-tep's motives and methods.  Those who profaned the sacred tomb meet a grim end.  Together, Karloff and Freund make this film a classic.  The comic-book level Mummy action adventure flicks of recent vintage suffer in comparison to the genuine article.  ;-)
$SUMMARY.: "Come out under the stars of Egypt."

Dare I say one of the best movies  of the century, and the best thriller ever made.The original and  how-did-they-think-of-that-idea story is based on how Cole Sear (Haley Joel  Osment) can see dead people and how Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) can help  him with his problem.

However there is still plenty of back-to-school fun to be had in character building if not arithmetic basics
I agree that there are timeless lessons that can never be taught too much in learning friendship, cooperation, obedience and structure

$REVIEW.: The Opera National du Rhin has staged Die tote Stadt as a depiction of Paul's decline into madness, ending in suicide.  This differs from Korngold's conception, and from typical stagings (e.g., New York City Opera's), in which Paul enters a dream about Marie/Marietta, but ultimately breaks free of it.  To me, the altered staging adds nothing to the value of the opera.But for those of us who love Korngold's music, it is still wonderful to see and hear this opera on DVD.  Angela Denoke and Torsten Kerl are excellent portrayers of Paul and Marietta.  Birgitta Svenden is a nice bonus as Brigitte, and Yuri Batukov is more than adequate as Frank, as are all the other supporting singers.  It is intererting, however, that Kerl, a light-voiced tenor, seems to be working mightily to sing the role just as Rene Kollo did in the old LP version that is now available on CD.I'd rate this five stars if it weren't for the sometimes distracting antics associated with Opera du Rhin's "innovative" (OK, Eurotrash) staging -- nuns morphing into prostitutes, members of Marietta's troup dressed as drag queens, Paul fondling a skeleton on the stage, Frank as a bishop in the third act, handing Paul a knife or razor with which to kill himself, that sort of thing.  Yes, I see what they were driving at, but no, I don't think it was a good idea.

$REVIEW.: Like other skeptics of this film, when I first picked it off the shelf, I was extremely skeptical of the film.  The cover looked pretty uninteresting, giving off the vibe of Coming Home or some other cheesy feel good hippy film with a hearty dose of sixties-seventies optimism.  It was directed by Oliver Stone, a man who is certainly not known for even handed portrayals of political subjects. And Tom Cruise, the pretty boy from the kitschy and lame beyond lame Top Gun, playing the lead?  How can this be any good of a film?Well, I'm entirely certain that I was completely wrong, very wrong.  This is a great movie, and the somewhat cheesy cover art and packaging of the film misleads you into what could be one of the most painful war movies that deal with the aftereffects of war, easily on the same line as the Deer Hunter.  No, it's not as scary as being confined to replaying Russian Roulette over and over again, but it's most certainly an emotionally distressing, and Tom Cruise does a fantastic job getting all of the suffering and misery across.  I've always thought Tom Cruise is a better actor than people give him credit for, and despite how annoying he can off camera (not to mention his spotty filmography) he still can certainly put a good performance if he chooses the right ones.  With all of this in line, this is one war film that deserves more praise than it gets, especially among audiences and film enthusiasts.Now, the film is not perfect (most films aren't, but that's another kettle of fish), and I know, like many Oliver Stone films, it's slanted towards the left; Vietnam the way Oliver Stone and Ron Kovic saw it (both very anti-war).  However, I feel that there certainly are many valid and interesting viewpoints made during the film, Also, Stone's genuine passion for the subject through experience makes it more worthwhile.  Most importantly though, it easily transcends these flaws with great acting, superb directing, great editing, a direct and raw approach to many of the displays of war (instead of extremely diminishing it with some stupid metaphor or symbol) and a spare-no-punches, gut instinct, intensity almost through the whole movie.  Best of all however, is it never loses touch with being a human.  For all the political points of view, Born on the Fourth of July, at heart, is still a humanistic study of one man's internal and external struggle with war, and it never loses it's characterization or real human struggles through any of it's views.Anyway, this is a great film, near the same level as Oliver Stone's Platoon (still haven't seen Heaven and Earth).  While some of the content in this film is definitely fiction, it shouldn't stop you from seeing this great film.  Tom Cruise has never been better, and Oliver Stone spares no punches and goes right for the gut (and very much succeeds).  It all adds up for a very exhausting, but ultimately uplifting and rewarding film.  Very highly recommended.

$review_text.: I love this movie and have watched it many times. Erin comes from a struggling background, learns of an infraction against a small town that was deliberately deceived by a major corporation. She persists and ultimately a successful judgment is received for the residents of the town of Hinkley, California. This story for me is proof that even a small person can create a wave to overcome something corporate giants think will never happen to them.The language within the movie is strong but it fits the story. Pushy and outspoken is how Erin wades through rhetoric and legalese. I love her tenacity. At the end of the movie, though, Erin is speechless and you'll have to watch it to see why.If you haven't seen this movie I highly recommend it and watch all the interviews, deleted scenes, and director comments. Do I even have to add that Julie Roberts was so believable as Erin Brockovich. Love her as an actor. My other favorite Is Albert Finney who has a subtle wit in dealing with Erin's outbursts.

I loved the disc art and wasn't too happy when they took that away in favor of the blue and white discs for blu-rays and silver for the dvds. With the dvds it's especially difficult to see the names of the movies.Since we have so many and we travel so much I put my movies in binders so it's easily portable. Now most of our blurays look the same and it's really boring.They've also stopped giving out discs for digital copies and now we have to download the movies from iTunes.

$REVIEW.: This is one of the silliest movies I've ever saw. Take our Main Character, Please. He can barely play a straight man let alone a gangster. Sorry writers, but a wimpy man with an affected accent telling us his life story is not a good movie. "Now let me tell you about Paulie." Sorry we don't give a damn. Next we have Robert De Niro, yep the man who played the Godfather got stooped into playing in this turkey. Sorry, Bob. At least his character is likable. Next in the trio is Joe Pesci, - after playing the villain in Michael Jackson's Moonwalker he got a big head and thought he was a real actor, sadly enough that role was Oscar worthy compared to this.If these guys weren't enough, enter our main character's girlfriend. She's ok until she starts talking, then its zero to tramp in 4.8 seconds. After about three consecutive scenes of this trollop in training I turned the movie off; and I've sat though some bad movies in my time. It'd be ok if this was supposed to be a comedy, but they try to pass it off as drama. Really, at one point we are actually introduced to a character named something like "Jimmy Two-times - because he says everything two times. Says everything two times. I'm not making this up! Unless you're a film student studying bad movies, don't watch "Goodfellas".

$REVIEW.: The good TV series are the ones that stand up over time
I think "Emergency" does this pretty well


Like many series, it ran a season or two over its useful life (after a while, they had done every kind of rescue, and the doctors had treated every kind of ailment)
But this DVD, Season 2, finds the series hitting its stride
The characters interact very well, the stories are good -- just a solid action-drama, with some humor sprinkled in.One more thing: The alert tone that preceded the dispatcher's words was the greatest single sound effect in TV history


I use it for my cell phone ring tone.

$REVIEW.: The first five minutes are as funny and economical as any on record. The main characters reveal themselves hilariously, while Nicholas Cage's voice-over regales as classic understatement. The dialogue remains offbeat and original,with only occasional lapses. Cage and Hunter often sound as if they've watched too much Oprah, rambling on about the family "unit", or his description of her infertility as "insides too barren for my seed to get a purchase". With this film the Coen Bros. prove they can do comedy as expertly as melodrama, as does Cage, whose mix-master hairdo and bewildered expression reflect the social rules he just can't seem to get right. Only businessman Nathan Arizona remains a sane sensible voice throughout, a departure for the usually anti-business world of film. Almost stealing the show is William Forsythe as Evelle the quarter-wit brother of half-wit John Goodman. His gap-toothed grin and eternal high spirits amidst a starkly blank expression remind me of a demented Cheshire cat. The movie as a whole amounts to a light-hearted jape at family obsessed America, where by Hunter's logic some peoples has too many kids while others ain't got enough, so it's okay to take from them that has too many. Sort of like socialist logic applied to child distribution. On a more ominous note is a Keystone Cops indictment of gun-toting America, where too many civilians and cops alike come armed and ready to shoot, except Cage who reveals a benign inner nature by refusing to load. Only the epilogue and Randy Cobb disappoint. Cobb certainly looks the part of cartoon evil, but can't project the menace to go with it. With these dim but lovable characters, it's obvious the Bros. were at sea in figuring out how to end. It's as though they're suddenly embarassed with the liberties taken with the institution of family, so only a Norman Rockwell level of smarmy apology can compensate. Too bad, because the compensation is already there in the characters of H.I. and Ed (Cage & Hunter). Nonetheless, the movie remains fresh and rollicking, thrusting the Coens to the forefront of independent filmmakers, and presenting the audience with a good number of belly laughs along the way.

 Artful story telling with an ending so sweetly beautiful I was in tears
 It amuses you, engages you, challenges you


 It is by no means a horror story
 The use of demons and hell are ultimately just expressions which help the viewer understand the context
 Just perfect

 I love this movie more than I can say.

$REVIEW.: Writer/Director Michael Doughery's "Trick 'r Treat", (2007), is a wonderful, scary anthology of Halloween tales that will make everyone be afraid.In the tradition of "Tales from the Crypt"; Stephen King/George A. Romero's "Creepshow", (1982); and "Tales of Terror", (1976), we have:~A couple who like Halloween. When the wife sees a "Michael Myers"-like masked figure on the street, she get frightened, only to meet her death at other hands, as a Jack O' Latern creature watches on;~In the second story a overweight, candy-loving boy steals candy from Steven, (Dylan Baker), a respected schoolteacher by day; by night, he's a Serial Killer; while Red Riding Hood, Anna Paquin, "The Piano", (1993); "X Men trilogy"; and "True Blood" tv show, and her friends go out on the town. When a man pretends to be a 'real' Vampire, he gets more than he bargains for during Halloween, as the Jack O'Latern makes another appearance;~In the third story, a girl tells her friends a story about a bus driver who makes a pact with parents of their 'distubed' childen to kill them, but when one of the kids, (dressed as Dracula), overtakes the bus, and it plunges into the sea, the driver barely survives. As a girl freaks out when her friends pretend to be the ghosts of the kids, she leaves them to their deaths, as she sees the same Jack O' Latern, while she pulls a trolley down the street;~The forth story is about a old man, (Brian Cox), "Manhunter", (1986); "The Ring", (2002); and "Zodiac", (2007), who sees Steven in the backyard. As his neighbor, he hates Halloween. When he tries to kill the Jack O' Latern, (who just wants his treats), he gets so scared, that he will do anything to stay alive.In the end, the story ends like the beginning: The couple talk in the street, she doesn't die; the old man gets a knock on the front door. He gives out candy, then gets another fright, as the Jack O' Latern has finished his work on Halloween for the night.I give the movie five stars. Highly recommended.The DVD also has Michael Doughtery's short film "Seasons Greetings" (2006) which the Jack O'Latern goes trick and treating on peoples' doors only to be killed by a Halloween hating man."Trick 'r Treat" is R for strong violence and adult themes.

$review_text.: Penguins are just cool.  Whether they are sitting on eggs, singing and dancing, or, in the case of this movie, surfing through rocks and waves, penguins just can't seem to do anything wrong these days.  I admit, I wasn't looking forward to seeing "Surf's Up."  The idea of watching a movie about surfing penguins seemed to have as much entertainment potential as the idea that involves the singing and dancing mouse who has his own theme park, ho ho.  I did see "Surf's Up" though, see it I did.  Partially because it was an original idea.  Call me crazy, but after getting a third helping of overacting pirates, swinging spiders, and gambling thieves (who have yet to wise up and hire a money manager) going through the motions, I was all ready for something original.  Even if the movie in question was only marginally original.Yet something strange happened during my viewing of "Surf's Up:" I found myself smiling a lot.  Why was I smiling?  Here was a true life story about a penguin who wants to move out of the North Pole, away from his fat brother and ignorant mother, leave his fish sorting job behind (a job that seems more useless then the thankless job of making sure jack-in-the-boxes work), and prove himself to be a great surfer.  The penguin who wants to leave is one named Cody Maverick, the small egg of the family.  His brother is the size of Michael Moore, his mother acts like Tea Leoni (though is not voiced by her), and his dad is never seen because he was eaten by a killer shark.  This is all documented by a film crew, who want to capture the life story of a penguin making his aim for the surfing dream.It's kind of like an animated "Hoop Dreams," though two hours appears to be missing from this film.  The documentary crew followed Cody for about three months of his life, capturing all his intimate moments on camera.  Cody brags and boasts about his ambitions to be the number one surfer in the world, yet when he remembers the rough childhood he had, the cameras catch his reaction on camera.  Cody fondly remembers meeting his idol Big Z, who was the surfing champion until an accident happened during a competition, resulting in Z's death.  We get the feeling Cody never really got over the death.  I know how he feels, I never really got over the unexpected death of Gene Siskel.  Anyway, Cody is entering the competition now, with his best friend Chicken Joe, and his new rival Tank.All the while he falls in love with the lovely Lani, who I assume looks a little provocative for a children's movie, but maybe this is where the MPAA's PG rating comes in.  Being a documentary film and all, many of the shots look grainy and there are scratches on the print sometimes.  Documentaries use different cameras with a different brand of film, so it's easy to see why the movie might not look as clear as some of the recent summer blockbusters.  You also get the sense that the camera crew are not as experienced in making movies as most people are.  The camera constantly shakes a bit, sometimes the microphones show up in the shot when the action gets hectic, but otherwise you can feel the film crews enthusiasm to make this movie as good as it could be.Sadly, I heard that the film crew totally forgot to get the use of the animals real voices for use in the movie, and so Hollywood actors such as Shia LaBeouf, Jeff Bridges, Jon Heder, and James Woods were called in to dub over the animals.  Granted, with the exception that the animals sound familiar, the dubbing is perfect, and I doubt many kids will notice anything is off.  I didn't initially know why I enjoyed this movie so much.  Part of me chalked up my enjoyment of the movie coming off a long, rough week.  This could be true, but I think it's more then that.  I bad movie tends to worsen a bad mood for me.  A good movie helps lift me up from it."Surf's Up" caught me off guard because it's such a charming film.  I admit it's a bit predictable for a documentary, but it's also more uplifted then "An Inconvenient Truth" is.  After the movie was done I snapped my fingers in frustration: I never learned to surf, and I don't have a beach to go to periodically.  Oh well, there's always a trip to New Jersey that can fix that.  At the moment, this is the front runner for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.Rating: **** stars

$REVIEW.: In 1968, George Romero and John Russo wrote a zombie film that would reinvent the Horror genre and fear itself. Nearly twenty years later, Russo would team up with Sci-Fi guru Dan O'Bannon, writer of the seminal ALIEN, to create RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, the first major zombie breakthrough in America outside of Romero's original trilogy, and still one of the most successful and hilarious Horror Comedies of all time.The film proposes that the events in the DEAD films were real, and that the bodies of the undead corpses were shipped around the country in containers sealed by the government. When a group of punks unwittingly breach the seals on one of these containers, a horde of fiendish ghouls are unleashed in a nearby cemetery as the group struggles to survive! RETURN's exaggerated comic book characters are living embodiments of 80s pop culture, and each are written with a biting cynicism and sharp wit. 80s genre favorites Miguel Nunez, Linnea Quigley, and Thom Mathews line the cast, and are joined by Golden Age actors Clu Gulager, James Karen, and Don Calfa. Cannibalistic ghouls had been clamoring for fresh meat since the late 60s, but it wasn't until 1985 that their tastes turned to a more delectable delicacy: "Braaaaains.." As the re-animated corpses would tell you themselves, brains became the only cure for the pains of death, resulting in a series of brutal attacks and head-munching. By this time, Tom Savini had become synonymous with gore and zombie make-up FX, but here, Allan Apone brings O'Bannon's original conceptions to life with equally (if not more) memorable creations, the most impressive of which being the skeletal Tar Man. The film's down-trodden ending is as much a comment on the expendability of 80s youth as it is a satirical look at Reagan-era politics, where nuclear holocaust was just a button away.Where Romero's DEAD series adapted the true life horrors of racial discrimination and consumerism into a frightening NIGHT, DAWN, and DAY of terror, O'Bannon's tongue-in-cheek approach is just as valid and as smart as its obvious influences. RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD will remain one of the all-time genre classics, and a staple in 80s Horror viewing!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies

This movie was awful, ruining the night for the girls!  The 16 mo. old was bored after only a few minutes and the 30 mo. old was frightened.  She is very empathetic, so she was quite upset to see the bull frog beating up the smaller toads.  Plus, I'm trying to teach her not to hit and this video has puppets fighting!?  She was so upset about the bull frog, we never even made it to the disection scene.My parents are also upset that their gift was frightening.  They thought it was "The Muppet Movie".

$review_text.: This is--hands down--the funniest film of the year. Kristin Wiig's story of a hapless maid of honor who just can't seem to get it right, is hilarious and touching, all at the same time.  The casting is brilliant.  Maya Rudolph (daughter of the famous Minnie Riperton) plays more of the straight role to Wiig's over the top comic relief.  Rose Byrne is divine as a conniving maid of honor wannabe, and Melissa McCarthy steals the show on many occasions as the one friend who ultimately gets Wiig's character "Annie" to finally see the light.  This is not a chick flick, but for those ladies looking for a delicious leading man, Chris O'Dowd plays a cute (and strong, and funny) Irish cop who stops "Annie" for a broken tail light, and eventually becomes the man she never realized she needs.  This movie will definitely be a classic.

$review_text.: What a rebirth indeed


Di Caprio is finally finding his way to some adult roles


He learned the trade from Scorsese and The Departed

Now he pushes it into some thickening and intensity in this film

He knows how to use his facial expressivity to mean cynicism, hatred, violence, meanness, viciousness, cruelty, etc..


though not yet the rising physical desire that may accept to condescend to turn into something more intense, even passionate


That's his face, and close-ups are numerous


Yet his body language does not remain that coherent and he still keeps some of his adolescent even pubescent lascivity in some attitudes and movements


He will learn, they say, provided they do not lock him up in roles of villains just the way they had locked him up in roles of smooth-skinned and practically hairless desirable adolescents, in spite of Basketball Diaries where he had quite another potential


So Leonardo Di Caprio is coming of age and may have found a completely new field of artistic expression

Yet the film was expected for a completely different reason


The mythic scandal of our modern world: the wars both for and fed by diamonds in Africa but waged by children soldiers who enrich some weapon dealers and diamond speculators with not only their blood, but also the blood of their parents shed by and with their own hands


The film is poignant because of the presence of several artists, the main black actor of course but also Emmanuel Jal and his music, who were children soldiers themselves


This film is ruthless, systematic, unavoidable in the obvious conclusion that the rich of this world need these wars to become richer

This commitment of an actor like Leonardo Di Caprio to this necessary struggle to make our world more humane, can only help millions of people to understand those wars have to stop, not be stopped by tyrannical foreign military interventions, but by negotiations, economic sanctions and sentences against those who are responsible for these unacceptable feudal if not even more primitive ambitions that can only be fulfilled by the enslavement of millions and the victimization of all those who are not members of the closed clan of power they are part of

$REVIEW.: That's right - I don't usually buy fiction "novels" (unless they're Jane Austen!) either in print or on the screen, but I have admired Christopher Reeve so much as a human being, that I wanted him on screen away from "Superman", and I have him now, in this fine movie.As for the story itself, I think I'll enjoy it more the next time I view it, having learned already & felt the undercurrents, the unspoken words, the "what's-going-on" with the characters, the first time.  The "plot" is there, really, not so much in the actual actions or verbiage of anyone.  The acting is impeccable.  Couldn't be better.  Emma Thompson always surprises me with her expertise.  After falling love with her in "Sense and Sensiblilty", in which, to me, she, Emma, WAS the heroine, somehow I always expect her to BE that sort of character, which of course she's not.  Don't expect any great romantic love story in this film; the meat is elsewhere.Optional sub-titles are available.

$REVIEW.: Air Force is the best film This action film, for me, should be rated as being a "Action Film". Harrison Ford once again plays the reluctant hero, and plays it very well.This is a great film if you want to sit back and be entertained without having to think too much.It will not set your world on fire but you will enjoy it,The picture quality is very good with a nice anamorphic transfer and very few marks on the print, This film may suffer from a slightly unbelievable story line but when you have Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman and Glenn Close delivering performances as strong as these, In this action packed blockbuster, Hollywood legend Harrison Ford stars as President Marshall on board the presidential plane Air Force 1. 1000's of feet in the air President Marshall is horrified when he discovers that the plane has been hijacked by communist radicals. Unless he meets the demands of Korshunov (radicals leader), everyone on board Airforce One will be executed. As well as having to save his own skin the President also faces the daunting prospect of having to rescue his wife and daughter from the jaws of death.In a film which sees the President's daughter held at gunpoint and his plane chased by Russian fighter jets, Air Force One takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. This thriller has more twists and turns than the River Nile and is bound to keep you on the edge of your seat right through to the closing credits.As well as having an excellent plot that keeps both the mind and eye stimualted, the quality of the acting and special effects used make a major contribution to the film. Any movie which features a household name such as Harrison Ford usually guarantees acting of the highest quality and Air Force One is no exception. Ford maintains his reputation as being a top class yet versatile actor in a career that has seen his roles range from playing an outer space cowboy through to an adventurer in the deepest jungle. Although not in the same league as the Indiana Jones or Starwars trilogy.

$review_text.: Star Wars on steroids. Lucas Gone Wild! with CGI effects. Style over substance. In a nutshell, that is what you have with these 'prequel' movies. After the fact add-ons to the true movies that should have stopped at 3. Now, with more toys to play with, Lucas forgets about what makes a good movie, WRITING and DIRECTION, and instead goes balls out to cram as many special effects cheese he possibly can in virtually every shot, literally trying to fill the sky with machines and robots. Its all so excessive and ridiculous. Who even can remember the convoluted plot lines? Everyone instantly knows and can succinctly recap the plot lines for Star Wars, Empire and Jedi, but you can't do it with these CGI laden messes. Lucas tries so hard to impress us with his new found technological wizardry ("I'll show em what I 'meant' to do with Star Wars!' w/ evil maniacal laugh) that he forgets the ONE most important thing he SHOULD have learned at USC's film school etc----PLOT AND STORYLINE are what makes a good movie in the end. 2001 A Space Odyssey is a classic not just because of the incredible for its time special effects (1968), but because the STORY and the PLOT was interesting and compelling, and still is after all these years.Some dweebs (see comments below) forget that these movies were meant to appeal to the wide-eyed child in ALL of us, like any classic movie in this genre does (ie see Wizard of Oz). They weren't meant to be forgotten or ignored once you turned 18. Instead, Lucas concentrated too much on appealing to the computer geeks and forgot how to put together a story.These prequels are the equivalent of a Super Sized McDonald's Happy Meal with a whole bunch of toy prizes packed in. The under 35 cell phone obsessed American Idolized computer game hypnotized generation will devour it in minutes, only to be forgotten about and hungry again within hours, with the toys quickly abandoned and scattered. These are consumed but not ingrained, they are digested and pooted out, but not seared into the cell structure. So sad it came to this.....in a galaxy not that far away.

$REVIEW.: First off, I'm a huge fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, so the 3 star rating is not for the films themselves, although there are parts of them that might get fewer than 5 stars, but not many. I'm not going to comment much on the films themselves because what else is there to say? They are awesome! My 3 star rating is actually for the overall package of the DVD set. The video & sound quality are excellent, so no problems there. However, I give it 3 stars because there is so much here that is lacking. There is so much more that could have been added, but for some strange reasons, wasn't. First, why is there only 1 bonus disc between three films when the DVDs of Episodes I & II got TWO DISCS each? This makes no sense. There have been so many specials about Star Wars over the years (like that infamous Holiday Special, which, no matter how corny it was, would still be cool to see on DVD) that surely, more features could have been added. Second, where are all the deleted scenes that have become legendary for many Star Wars fans? The early scenes with Biggs & Lukes other friends, the snowtroopers running into a bunch of wampas and the sandstorm scene in Jedi. Most DVDs have deleted scenes nowadays, so why not Star Wars? And finally, I know these are George Lucas' films, but knowing how fanatical & devoted the fans are, why couldn't we have gotten one disc with bonus material, one disc for the special editions and one (or possibly a double-sided disc) with the original versions, so that fans, new & old, can see how the films were "way back when". I mean, I know he felt changes were necessary, and I agree, they are kind of cool, BUT, when I first saw Star Wars at the age of ten, I don't remember no one complaining, do you? Sure, you might be able to buy the original versions on video through ebay or something, but videotape doesn't last forever. And the quality is usually crap. It's too bad Lucas only seemed to pay attention to what HE wanted and not what the fans wanted, but I guess you can't have everything. Still, these great films are finally on DVD, though somewhat altered, and with a few features missing, so I shouldn't complain too much, but it just bugs me that they overlooked so much. So, even though I seem to love to complain, I still bought 'em and liked 'em.

$REVIEW.: This is my favorite film on the life of Jesus
 It is based on the Gospel of Luke

 Not every event in the film is in Luke's gospel or vice versa

 But I enjoy this film nonetheless.It is filmed in the Holy land and most of the actors are like those you see in that land

 The acting is excellent


 I appreciate that the director allows children to play roles in the movie, for Jesus loved children


 Not like today, where people claim that "they are for the children" but then vote for politicians who saddle the children with an unbearable debt
 At the end of giving the parable about the good Samaritan, Jesus asks "who acted as this man's neighbor?" and a small child answers

 In Luke's gospel, a grown man answers, however the slight changing of events do not bother me since the message remains the same.In the film you will often hear background voices

 For example there is the occasion where a poor old lady deposits two small copper coins into the Temple treasury, since all she had were those two coins

 As she is doing this, you can hear people in the background commenting, in cockneyed accents, "only a mite?" "can't she give more?" "it's very little."  These sayings are not documented in the gospel but again, do not detract from the message; rather they emphasize our own sinful nature and our need to repent.

$REVIEW.: "Bronson" is based on the real life of a man often referred to as "the most violent prisoner in Britain".  "Charlie Bronson" is a moniker the prisoner (real name: Michael Peterson) assumed as a sort of stage name.  According to the film, Peterson desired to be famous and went about garnering that fame by perpetuating heinously violent actions against other prisoners and prison guards.The film is bloody, violent, disturbing, and incredibly effective.  Tom Hardy is a powerhouse in the role in every sense of the word.  He's an imposing figure to start.  His powerfully built wrestler's physique makes the improbabilities of his physical altercations believable.  He captures the audience's attention in a stranglehold of a performance, playing straight a role that could have easily turned into an insane human cartoon.  Instead we watch a credibly complex sociopathic character unfold who is apparently choosy about upon whom he will wreck his carnage (primarily the heavily armed and numerous prison guards).  His mirthless laughter at the beginning of the film puts the audience off-kilter, not quite able to regain balance until some time after the end credits roll.  You're never quite sure what Hardy's Bronson is going to do next.  He's so pitch perfect throughout the film, it's hard to take your eyes off this living disaster.The film is essentially presented from Bronson's point of view, which lends itself to some strange storytelling considering his sociopathic bent.  Some self-narrated fantasy asides are at first quite bizarre as they're occurring with Bronson telling his story on stage in full makeup.  There is a heavy dose ofA Clockwork Orange-style cinematography, especially when Bronson is committed to a truly bizarre mental institution.  Again, this could be interpreted as Bronson's views of the situation, not how they actually were.  There's also an odd measure of homo-eroticism in the film -- Bronson seems to attract the attention of gay men, albeit never has any semblance of romantic reciprocation -- and you'll see more than one fully nude shot of Tom Hardy's man-bits including a scene where he commandeers a male prison librarian to give him a full-body butter rubdown to make him more difficult to handle in the upcoming fight.I couldn't quite put my finger on whether or not director Nicolas Winding Refn finds Bronson to be a sympathetic character (a little off-putting in itself), but it's obvious that Refn is fascinated with Bronson's complexities.  One can't help but feel that Bronson deserves every last brutal beating he receives at the hands, feet, and batons of the prison guards, as he is presented as the exclusive instigator of each outpouring of violence.  The last image of Bronson, bloodied and confined in a solitary cage, whimpering like a wounded animal, is bound to stick with you for a while.Bronson is brutal, but fascinating to watch, walking a thin line that dispassionately presents a violent life without glorifying the perpetrator.  It'll most likely make you uncomfortable, but then again, how else would you portray a guy who wanted to get famous by fashioning the persona of Britain's most violent prisoner?

$review_text.: I'm 21 years old and have grown up watching old westerns such as Bonanza, Gunsmoke, Laramie, Big Valley and Wagon Train. Out of those five, Bonanza is my second favorite (Gunsmoke is my first). I have a lot of Bonanza DVD's and all of them have episodes the others have. As much as I like Bonanza, I will not buy anymore DVD's unless they are season sets or have different episodes. This set has the same exact episodes that all of the other Bonanza DVD's that have been released in the past have. I don't understand why they keep releasing the same episodes over and over again. All they are doing is changing the covers of the DVD cases.Now if there is someone who doesn't have these episodes, let me tell you they are great episodes and you wont regret buying them. But if you are like me, who have these episodes on other sets, then don't waste your money.I give Bonanza five stars and usually I give the DVD's that have been released five stars. This one I am giving three stars because of the fact that these episodes are already out there on numerous Bonanza sets.They need to start with the seasons sets now and if for what ever reason they can't do season sets, I understand but at least release different episodes that people don't have.

$review_text.: I was really psyched about seeing PROMETHEUS and it was a big visual feast in an IMAX theatre with 3D glasses...but, afterward, thinking about the story...this movie was a wreck.There's a hilarious youtube video where one guy rants about all the things that don't add up in the film (and he's right).  I can't link it here, but it's really funny.  Some guy on a couch sitting next to another guy sitting mutely.Basically, scientists assemble cave drawings that point to an outer space connection to life on earth.  The aliens who probably started mankind, as well as life on earth, are called the Engineers and the scientists head into deep space to find them.  Good start.  Man searching for his origins.But then the story begins to fall apart.  And the scientists appear to be the dumbest people on this mission.  The usual corrupt elements who want to screw over the hapless humans on the mission to get alien specimens jump the gun for some reason and turn the crew into their little experiment...a long, long way from home...and threatening to cut off their way home...wait...WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE?  Knowing this film is somehow tenuously connected to ALIEN is like waiting for another better movie to barge into the movie you're watching.  And then it happens.  And you have no idea what's going on.But, hey, it looked awesome on the big screen in 3D.

$review_text.: In the words of one synopsis writer, this 'has been done before' but he could have added 'ad nausiam'.  The art or CGIis not up to the standard of Umemaro or Appleseed, but they try.  I should explain I do not like cats and would neverbe impressed by any work castng favorable light on them (e.g. they are FAR stupider than dogs - but smarter than sheep - they smell, scratch, carry fleas - like dogs - but they poop, indoors, in hidden places found only when your nose leads you there.).My bias made clear, the DVD under discussion tries hard to amuse you and it might well work on another less subject to bias than I.  But I found too often the alleged allergy of the primary suspect is only operative now and then(I must stress I am not subject to allergies so I have little understanding of HOW allergies affect other, lesser, men) but I noticed the lack of alergic effect on the subject character at times when his proximity dictated he SHOULD havesuffered - but the dramatic moment required that he do some act not involving sneezing, watering at the eyes, loss ofbalence, etc, etc, which would have hindered his heroic duties and blown the plot trajectory.Give this to your Aunt Tilly (the maiden aunt who has cats - but no alergies except to tree and grass pollens and not cat dander) or one of your enemies you don't really want to make peace with.

$REVIEW.: I was so excited about this film. I heard great things not just from critics, but from regular people. I just kept waiting for a point when I could feel something for the characters, but it never came. I didn't just dislike them, they flat-out irritated me. Not only were the characters exploitive and undeveloped, there wasn't much interesting about this film at all. Near the beginning, the two best friends masturbate together while talking about the wife of one of their cousins. I almost stopped it right then, but made the mistake of wasting more of my time. It basically was softcore porn, but worst because it was supposed to be a serious movie. This whole story was about sex and cheating, and not giving much forethought to either of these things. It tried to make it seem like it had a lot more going for it, but failed miserably.If you like mindless, sexually exploitive movies that parade as meaningful films, you'll love this one.

$REVIEW.: Full Metal Panic! is the sleeper hit that many hail as one of the greatest anime ever made. With a unquic of pairing of mecha and high school love comedy genres come up with something completely new. With top notch music and excellent voice acting. Full Metal Panic! showcases some of the best character designs and development found anywhere. Along with smooth and vivid animation Full Metal Panic is . . . okay okay enough I think you get the point. Is Full Metal Panic! a good series worth buying, yes and no. As you can see I gave Full Metal Panic a 4 star rating for a couple of reasons. First off is plot progression is not what you call smooth after the second disc. Don't get me wrong when I said unsmooth I mean it's a little rough with five or six episodes that are just plain filler say for maybe a few seconds in each. Also every so often there is oh and this is how it is just because it is moments that always drive me crazy and shouldn't exist in a twenty-six episode series. The second reason is that there really is how do you say substance or reason for the action for anyone's actions out side the series. Like where the hell is Sousake's parents and who would let their kid become a mercenary at seven? Or why did he become a mercenary in the first place? Or why is Gouren an evil jerk? The same can be said for every other character with the exception of Kanami and Tessa they are all just how they are no explanations given. Which further bugs me. Lastly what prevents me from giving Full Metal Panic a perfect grade is the plot itself, there are no twists no turns that to make things interesting making it kinda boring. As an added note it's kinda sad that one of best parts of the series doesn't even have the main female lead in it at all. Food for thought. All in all would I recommend this series to buy this series, yes go ahead it's quiet good just not perfect.

$review_text.: Back in the early 1970s biological warfare, aka germ warfare, was considered so nasty and heinous that over one hundred countries, including the United States, agreed to sign a pact outlawing the creation and stockpiling of toxicological weaponry...a nice gesture, to be sure, if anyone intended to stick to it...co-written and directed by Hal Barwood (Corvette Summer, Dragonslayer), Warning Sign (1985) stars Kathleen Quinlan (Twilight Zone: The Movie, The Doors, Lawn Dogs) and Sam Waterston (Rancho Deluxe, Heaven's Gate, "Law & Order").  Also appearing is Yaphet Kotto (Alien, Midnight Run), Jeffrey DeMunn (The Hitcher, The Green Mile), Richard A. Dysart (Pale Rider, "L.A. Law"), G.W. Bailey (A Force of One, Police Academy), Jerry Hardin (Cujo, "The X-Files"), and Rick Rossovich (Top Gun, Roxanne, Navy Seals).Kathleen Quinlan plays Joanie Morse, a security guard at Biotek Agronomics, a company, who on the surface, appears to be in the business of developing bio-engineered crops aka Frankenfoods, but is in actuality a gooberment front for a biological warfare facility.  After a series of unfortunate events an incident occurs, one that forces Joanie to initiate a complete lockdown of the facility (seems a vial containing a particularly vile and communicable germ was damaged, infecting nearly everyone in the building).  As Major Connolly (Kotto) and his containment team make the scene in their unmarked vehicles (let the cover up begin), Joanie's husband, Cal Morse, the sheriff in these parts, tries to figure out what's going on, enlisting the aid of a former Biotek worker named Dr. Dan Fairchild (DeMunn).  Things get a little hairy inside the facility, as people begin dropping like flies (Joanie seems strangely unaffected), but guess what?  The individuals infected aren't actually dying...far from it...the man-made germ, in fact, has the effect of making its victims scabby, angry, and eventually homicidal, proving yet again it's not nice to fool with Mother Nature.  Connolly sends in a team supposedly in an effort to recover the anti-toxin, but things go sour, eventually forcing Cal (who's a serious germophobe) and Dan to take matters into their own hands, to break into the facility to rescue Joanie, who appears to hold the key to the cure.  Cal and Dan run into serious resistance of the psychotic kind, as those inside, taken by the germ, aren't really receptive to visitors, and family members outside are growing hostile over the load of malarkey Connolly keeps dishing out (he initially claimed there had been an outbreak of a yeast infection within the building...oh bruther, break out the Monistat 3).  Exactly what kind of toxicological agent got released within the building?  What is its purpose and effects?  Why wasn't Joanie infected?  How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?All in all I really enjoy this entertaining little feature, despite a number of perceived sticking points within the plot.  I suppose one of my biggest issues was Joanie being able to communicate with Cal on a C.B. radio after the facility had been quarantined...talk about your security gaps.  And it's not like it was a big secret or anything, as Connolly was fully aware of it (he even used Cal's radio to talk to Joanie once or twice).  Given the secretive nature of the facility, I would have thought a quarantine situation would have also included a complete communication blackout from the outside world to prevent erroneous information from being leaked out, especially given the lengths Connolly was going to assuage the public with his preconceived responses to their questions.  I did like how Connolly's containment team was able to patch into the security system on the building from an outside receptacle.  Something else...seems to me if'n your dealing with organisms of such a dangerous nature, I'd think there'd be some sort of internal safeguard, one that could be activated from the outside, in case of dire emergency, a safeguard that would eliminate any and all living entities within the facility...perhaps a harsh solution, but given the nature of the work and the potential threat involved, an appropriate one.  A bit I did like was how Joanie's security access code, the one enabling her to reverse the containment measures (steel doors, etc.) was automatically disabled after the containment action was enabled.  This seemed to make a lot of sense, as you wouldn't want those inside, individuals wracked with fear and desperation (not to mention disease), utilizing the code to free themselves prematurely and endangering the rest of us.  Some of the weaknesses I perceived in the plot felt like a result of being there as a matter of convenience, allowing for other events to follow, as looked at times the writers may have painted themselves into a corner.  Based on the fact I enjoyed the film, I had little problem letting a lot of this slide.  I've always been a fan of Ms. Quinlan, although I must say I think she looks much more attractive with longer hair (she did make that security guard uniform look good, though).  I thought her performance her was good, and I appreciated the fact that she was a strong female figure with human qualities who could take care of herself up to a point (being rushed and overtaken by five psychotics doesn't count).  I didn't really feel the chemistry between her and Waterston, but perhaps that was because I have a slight `thing' for her ever since I saw her in the film Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983).  Some have used the term `zombie' in relation to this film, but I think that's a misnomer as those infected weren't really dead.  They seemed like they were cognizant, fully aware of themselves and others, and able to communicate, their main issues being uncontrollable anger and a propensity towards scabbing.  The story moves along pretty well with good intensity, although it did drag a little at some points, and the production values are better than average.  This, tied with competent performances, made for an entertaining ride.  I could have done without the schmaltzy ending, but whatever...I think my favorite bit was when the local yokels, taking matters into their own hands, decide they're going to break into the facility by taking a blowtorch to the steel containment doors.  Given Connolly's reluctance to share information, they didn't have much of an idea of what they might eventually let loose, but I was surprised how easily these goons were able to overtake the military on hand, especially given the danger posed if the infection ever got loose.  Connolly and his group had some definite security issues...Anchor Bay Entertainment provides a sharp looking widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, print here, along with a solid Dolby Digital Surround 2.0 audio track.

$review_text.: Andy Warhol's Dracula (as this film was originally known) was one of those films I was busting to see as a kid - it was also one of those films I was destined never to see as a kid - it was X rated when X meant sex and gore. Having finally seen this film 31 years after its original release, I'm a)sorry I didn't get a chance to see it then because my youth would have made me think it better than it really is, or b) sorry I waited with such anticipation.Oh, I saw Andy Warhol's Frankenstein many years ago, but for some reason couldn't ever get a copy of his Dracula. ...Frankenstein is over the top and features amateurish acting, but awesome costumes, sets and a really weird premise....Dracula features really amateurish acting, awesome costumes, sets, dynamite soundtrack, and a really logical premise (for a vampire film). The result is disappointing.The only thing that made the horrible acting in Frankenstein palatable was the totally bizarre storyline (which oddly was utilized in The Rocky Horror Picture Show).  Here, we have a relatively mundane storyline that makes complete sense by vampiric standards: Dracula needs virgin blood only...there's none to be found in Romania...he must travel to Italy, where it is believed, because of strong Catholicism there will be more virgins...he ensconses himself with a well to do Italian family and attempts to woo the couple's beautiful daughters in order to drain them dry.  Now, that's the basic premise. After almost 100 years of vampire films (yes, 100 years....), this is a relatively banal storyline. The "gimic" is that if Dracula drinks non-virgin blood, he vomits it back up and we get to see it.  This is hardly very shocking after seeing Dr. Frankenstein have sex via a surgical incision with a revived female body. It's hardly as gory as the veritble Shakespearian slaughter that occurs at the end of ...Frankenstein.Udo Kier, as Dracula, who has amazingly continued to find acting work up to this day even in U.S. films, is a horrible actor.  He overplays most every scene and underplays when he should overplay. Joe Dallesandro as the "handyman," is oddly, a Brooklynese Italian (much as he was oddly a Brooklynese Romanian in ...Frankenstein). He can't act. He is merely an oddity of the old Warhol Factory and a plaything of Warhol's. He doesn't disrobe with the aplomb that he did in ...Frankenstein to reveal all, but he certainly runs around without his clothes on a bit. Since these two actors make up the starring cast, it is refreshing that the supporting cast actually seem to know something about acting - at least much moreso than the supporting cast in ...Frankenstein. However, it is too little too late.By virtue of the fact that this film is so bad, it is also sad, that this film seems to actually have a subliminal message to it about the evils of socialism and how they seek to destroy tradition and values. Dracula, in this allegory actually represents tradition and values whereas the handyman, a Stalinist, represents the destruction of the church and traditional values (as he repeatedly speaks of rape and overthrowing the government).Therefore, it is unfortunate that ...Dracula comes up lacking in the expectation department. Perhaps, one should watch ...Dracula before seeing ...Frankenstein. Otherwise, the viewer's expectations about the films will find them disappointed.

$REVIEW.: "Spiderman 2" is the best film in the Spiderman series
Good special effects, an interesting villian, and a decent story come together in a film that will satisfy most actions fans.After a great title sequence, the film has a bit of a shaky start with some forced humor related to a janitor's closet but improves from there on in
Your enjoyment of this film will no doubt depend on your tolerance of Tobey Maguire's klutzy character and the continuing tease around his romance with Kirsten Dunst.Followed by a disastrous sequel.

$review_text.: Rabbit (Eminem) is a young rapper who has an opportunity to express himself on the stage in a rap-contest, but he chokes as he doubts his own rap skills.  The insecurities and fears of being humiliated is a wall of self-denial that prevents Rabbit to reach success and happiness.  In addition, he has a mother (Kim Basinger) who is emotionally neglectful and verbally abusive, which intensifies the insecurities of Rabbit. He is expressing his insecurities through rage that is expressed both verbally and physically; however, when it becomes to much for Rabbit, he has to face the music of his own insecurities.  8 mile is an entertaining film about self-expression and overcoming adversities.

$REVIEW.: Wolf Creek was filmed in and within 2hrs of Adelaide, even though the movie is set in north-western Australia


The cinematography is great and you would easily believe the characters covered 2500km on their journey.The movie starts out in Broome, Western Australia, a haven for backpackers
Here we are introduced to the 3 main characters, British tourists Liz and Kristy (played by Aussie girls Kestie Morassi and Cassie McGrath) and Ben (played by the locally well-known Nathan Phillips in his finest role to date)
The three plan to travel across the country to Ben's home-town of Sydney via Cairns, Darwin and Wolf Creek, the site of a meteor crater


(Actually spelled Wolfe Creek in real life).Having just bought a red Ford Falcon station wagon for the last few remaining dollars, the 3 spend one last night in Broome before heading off on their croos-country journey

In this time we see the 3 telling stories, singing songs, getting friendly with locals, gazing at the stars and finding love, but really it is just a chance for us to get to know the characters before the horror begins.Upon arriving at Wolf Creek, our would-be travellers are shocked to find their watches have ceased to work, and worse yet, their $1500 car won't start


Being stranded many km's from anywhere, panic and fear set in before the appearance of would-be saviour Mick Tayler

An outback nomad and unlikely hero.And it is here the movie takes a sharp turn into a hellish, edge of your seat nightmare for the characters and audiences alike.Writer and director Greg McLean has only one purpose in this movie, to scare the crap out of his audience and he succeeds, with the help of John Jarratt whom he often sought advice from

John is a veteran actor in Australia and is brilliant in the role of Mick Taylor

He comes across as a charming, humorous, friendly Aussie with the soul of a Hannibal Lecter


Given that John is most well known for working on lifestyle programs and childrens television shows in Australia, this role is a great example of his acting capabilities


He admitted to not doing much research for this role, but just let himself become Mick

One of his techniques was to not get to know the cast at all before shooting commenced so as to come across more terrifying, (because John really is a funny, nice guy)


Another method was to deviate from the script a lot to catch his victims off guard, trying to instill real fear in them.This is a great movie.
It was shot in 25 days on a shoestring budget and while you can tell, it is easy to look past this.An interesting fact to know is whilst shooting, the film-makers had to deal with a lot of inclamite weather, which caught them completely off guard given that they were filming in some locations where it hadn't rained in over 10 years...And also, whilst this is based very loosely on a true story, the site of Mick's campsite, was actually the scene of a real life double homicide, which I must point out was not known to the film-makers at the time.In summary, this is the best movie I have seen for a long time.

$review_text.: This is another great DVD for Last of the Summer Wine.  I especially like the episode &#34;There Goes the Groom&#34; which is the transition from Foggy (Brian Wilde) to Truly (Frank Thornton).  It was very well done with the hope that Foggy would be able to come back, but didn't take away from the story that he was unable to and Truly stayed in the role.  My particular favorite in this series is &#34; Oh Howard, We Should Get One of Those&#34; when Compo finally gets Nora in bed with him.  They are all good and worth watching over and over.

$REVIEW.: I just bought the original Planet Of The Apes boxed set on Blu-ray, the special 40 Year Evolution so I'm a fan of the series. This was better than I thought it would be having only watched the Amazon instant video version in low quality since my connection is crap slow... so I'll probably enjoy it more when i get the Blu-ray order. The star of the movie are the Apes no doubt, and the CG animations are pretty good... but it's the story and screenplay that makes you interested enough to suspend one's disbelief. Pinto is dead gorgeous and Franco does an adequate job but nothing special. The premise of how the apes acquired accelerated intelligence is something new and leaves me to wonder what's in store for sequels should this film prove lucrative enough to warrant further movies.Not a bad beginning, but the real challenge will be in creating a great sequel. I feel this film lacked a sic-fi edge, the soundtrack left me wanting for something a lot more mysterious... it plays out like a drama too much rather than sic-fi, I would have preferred something more enigmatic and puzzling in a score relating to this type of fantasy.

$REVIEW.: When I rented this movie, Amazon and TiVo somehow had the incorrect description and actors listed, so all I had to go on was the cover art...Surprisingly good movie for a direct to video. And like some other reviewers, I was surprised to see a movie with Bruce Willis included in both the cover art AND the script! I like movies that entertain me, not generally films that are too cerebral. This one has plenty of action, and in my opinion was some of Willis' best work since 'Tears of the Sun'. Oh, and Josh was pretty good too :-)

$REVIEW.: A saga of one the most legendary outlaws of the 20th century and the lawman tasked to take him down
 This is the third try by Hollywood in detailing this story and Johnny Depp follows in the footsteps of Lawrence Tierney and Warren Oates


 It is worth your time though, if you have seen the other versions, you will have a sense of deja vu

 Depp as Dillinger and Bale as Purvis are excellent in this Michael Mann directed gangster film (and as a fan of James Cagney, it's nice to see one again.)  A curious piece of history, Melvin Purvis would, many years later, commit suicide with the same gun he killed Dillinger with.

$review_text.: This film should get no stars.  I've enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan other movies, yeah they can be a bit off the wall but it kept me entertain and think about the message that I would get out of the film.  Yes this movie has a messeage as well, I mean natural unexplainable occurrences do happen but he should have delivered it in a different way. It's pretty bad when you are walking out the theater and people back of you and in front of you are saying what a dumb movie it was.  So for date night my husband and I decided to watch this movie over the new Indy film.  Since it had an R rated we expected M. Night Shyamalan to deliver a really good scary flick.  At credits we sat there like this is it.  He revealed the reason (I'm not going to give it away) why "the happening" was happening way too soon in the film.  The only reason why this film had a R rating is because of blood (mind you some scenes like the zoo scene didn't even look real- you can tell they were fake arms).  Not to mention that my husband and I like Mark Wahlberg (and since we are movie buffs we got a kick out of the idea that Mark's brother Donnie was in The Sixth Sense- kind of like a family affair type of thing), it was just a let down.  I will say that in the first scene it does capture your attention (seeing people freeze and than killing themselves) but at the end it just didn't live up to our expectations. One thing I always liked about M. Night Shyamalan films is there is some kind of twist at the end.  This film does not have that.  We have all of  M. Night Shyamalan on DVD at the moment but when The Happening gets released on DVD we will not buy this one. So disappointed.  If you want to see a good M. Night Shyamalan movie watch The Sixth Sense or Signs.

$REVIEW.: Based on a Richard Hooker novel of the same name, MASH was released in 1970 as a full-length feature film by 20th Century Fox before experiencing widespread success as a groundbreaking television sitcom in the Fall of 1972. The show's brilliant integration of drama and comedy made it one of the most celebrated shows in TV history, culminating in an eleven year prime time series stint. The 1983 series finale of MASH made history as the program with the single largest audience in television history, beating out several SuperBowls and the fabled "Who Shot J.R." episode of Dallas. With the proliferation of new television mediums, it's a record likely to never be broken...The sitcom is set in South Korea during American involvement in the Korea War (with M*A*S*H standing for "Mobile Army Surgical Hospital"). Buffered from the front lines by a mountain range and a minefield, the men and women of MASH were tasked with patching up wounded American soldiers. Unique to its genre, the cast of MASH was unusually large. Surgeons Dr. Benjamin Pierce (Alan Alda) and Dr. "Trapper" John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers) play the roles of excellent doctors who enjoy women and booze, while Dr. Frank Burns (Larry Linville) and Nurse Practitioner Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan (Loretta Swit) play foil to the two men's shenanigans (due to a contract dispute, Rogers' character was later replaced by Dr. B.J. Hunnicutt - played by Mike Farrell). The character of Frank Burns was also later replaced by Dr. Charles Emerson Winchester (David Ogden Stiers)...Corporal Max Klinger (Jamie Farr) provides comic relief with his early attempts to procure a discharge by dressing in women's clothing, and Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher) adds flavor to a diverse cast of characters. Also rounding out the cast are Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), Corporal Walter "Radar" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff), and Col. Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan)...The MASH (Season 3) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere "The General Flipped at Dawn" in which the MASH unit is visited by Major General Bartford Steele who, through his various actions, is perceived to be mentally insane. When Pierce goes over Steele's head in the transfer of a medical patient, Steele orders a court martial, but Pierce is cleared when it becomes obvious that Steele is a mental case... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include "Iron Guts Kelly" in which a recently expired general is smuggled to the front lines where he would've preferred to have died, and "Aid Station" in which Hawkeye, Houlihan, and Klinger bond while at the front and develop a new respect for one another...Below is a list of episodes included on the MASH (Season 3) DVD:Episode 49 (The General Flipped at Dawn)Episode 50 (Rainbow Bridge)Episode 51 (Officer of the Day)Episode 52 (Iron Guts Kelly)Episode 53 (O.R.)Episode 54 (Springtime)Episode 55 (Check-Up)Episode 56 (Life with Father)Episode 57 (Alcoholics Unanimous)Episode 58 (There is Nothing Like a Nurse)Episode 59 (Adam's Ribs)Episode 60 (A Full Rich Day)Episode 61 (Mad Dogs and Servicemen)Episode 62 (Private Charles Lamb)Episode 63 (Bombed)Episode 64 (Bulletin Board)Episode 65 (The Consultant)Episode 66 (House Arrest)Episode 67 (Aid Station)Episode 68 (Love and Marriage)Episode 69 (Big Mac)Episode 70 (Payday)Episode 71 (White Gold)Episode 72 (Abyssinia, Henry)The DVD Report

This is topnotch sci fi really and it's a fast paced movie

This was a hit movie in korea and was good enough to be shown over here

We need double features back because good movies like this one need a outlet here

The acting is very good too

On blu ray this looks great and it's a newer movie and that helps

It harkens back to the old monster on the loose movies and in this case the monster just wants to live actually
A fine flick that the korean's loved and so do I
It has english subtitles as well.

$REVIEW.: In a year or two, I won't be surprised if I see "Captain Phillips" bundled together with "Black Hawk Down."  It makes sense:  both deal with American encounters with Somalis and Somalia and both are superb, nail-bitingly intense stories that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.The story centers around Captain Richard Phillips (played by Tom Hanks in a performance that I bet gets him an Academy Award or at least a nomination for one).  The real-life Phillips was the master of the cargo ship Maersk Alabama, which was hijacked in 2009 by Somali pirates.  Phillips found himself adrift in a lifeboat with the pirates heading for Somalia until the US Navy decisively intervened.Besides Tom Hanks' standout performance as Phillips, the movie has multiple strong points:1.  The realism is very strong.  I found the sequence of scenes where the pirates chased and boarded the ship to be particularly convincing (it seems a real ship was used for much of it and if there were any CGI effects they were seamlessly integrated into the mix).  The stand-off on the high seas between the pirates and the Navy was another strong point (given the apparent participation of the US Navy in making the film).2.  The movie made the Somali pirates three-dimensional human beings instead of cardboard villains, but it didn't go overboard by even slightly attempting to excuse their despicable behavior.  The Somali actors playing them did a great job portraying desperate men who were willing to commit murder and terrorize people who had done nothing wrong to them for money.&lt;spoilers>3.  The movie also deserves praise for its depiction of how Phillips reacted to his ordeal.  Up until the point where the pirates were shot dead, he had shown a great deal of composure and cool-headed thinking.  But in the immediate aftermath of his rescue, guess what?  He went into shock.  How many times have we seen movies where the hero or heroine undergoes some sort of horrific ordeal and displays no evidence of that in its aftermath? Hank's showing Phillips having an emotional and physiological collapse after being held at gunpoint, threatened, abducted, and brutally beaten over a prolonged period, made the movie viscerally "real" to me.The film is not perfect.  I thought the first couple of minutes where Phillips drove to the airport from his home in the US with his wife was pretty dull, and given the fact that they didn't show any scenes with his wife or family after that, it was pretty pointless.  Another criticism I would have would be that the film didn't explain why after the first attempt by the pirates to hijack the ship was reported, there was no real response to the authorities.  But those are minor criticisms.  Bottom line:  this is a terrific movie.  I plan to see it again in the theaters, and I know I will be adding it to my DVD library.&lt;end spoilers>Here are some books I'd suggest looking into reading to get a better understanding of Somalia and piracy.The Pirates of Somalia: Inside Their Hidden WorldPirate State: Inside Somalia's Terrorism at SeaThe World's Most Dangerous Place: Inside the Outlaw State of Somalia

$review_text.: MAD magazine once compared movies made after the war with movies made during the war. This is DEFINITELY one made after the war. Somewhat sympathetic toward our German hosts, Brando as an SS officer but in reality a hired spy for the Allies and Yule Brenner in one of his best roles as a Captain for the German Merchant marine now unsure of his countries policy and beliefs. Improbable but interestingly written, the plot surrounds a vital shipment of Rubber bound for the Axis powers. Brando is blackmailed into stopping it by not allowing it to fall into enemy hands. He has a toxic relationship with Brenner, a Captain with a reputation for being drunk on duty.He frequently mocks Nazi ideals and is disappointed in his son, a Nazi sub officer who sinks hospital ships for a living. He even tries to hide a Jewish woman from the usual crew of fanatics on board in a "good samaritan" sequence which never would have appeared in a war period picture. Filmed in appropriate and errie Black & White, it features an excellent supporting cast and Brando in a very interesting role. Well worth it, off the beaten path of the usual war picture and shows imperfections on all sides. The Title is based on the salute of Gladiators in ancient Rome about to die in the arena.

$REVIEW.: I am a huge South Park fan, and this was the first full season I have ever bought. watching it on TV, I have never seen an episode I haven't loved, every single one has been funny, crude, and smart to the extreme, but after watching the first five minutes of the opening episode, a full length Terence and Phillip episode, I found myself drifting off to sleep without so much as a chuckle. Same with the next two episodes, Cartmans Mom is Still a Dirty **** and Chicken Lover. The jokes were bad, the political satire was cheesy, and did I mention the jokes were bad?Plus, another downside for this set, at least for the first two DVD's is that there is a five minute skit before every episode with the creators either yelling at old people in a nursing home or feeding a pig bacon. Not cool, because i CAN'T SKIP THE STUPID THINGS! If you press the skip button, it goes all the way to the next episode.Other than that though, this set is a definite winner. The rest of the episodes are very well done with that smart crude political and social satire that we've come to love, making fun of everything from big business to Nebraskans (something I found really funny because I'm from Nebraska myself). They pull no punches in South Park, nothing is safe from the brilliant minds of these two dorks (their names i can't remember off the top of my head). So go ahead, kill Kenny, join a cow cult, and play with a Christmas poop. if you don't find this show offensive, your dead, but no matter what I guarantee you it is sure to have you rolling on the floor in laughter.Replay value; high.

$REVIEW.: Originally a German production from a few years back, the awful, wooden English voice-dubbing just adds to the delightfully broad silly feel, and I thoroughly enjoyed the German heavy metal soundtrack. A fun, fairly well thought-out storyline, borrowing heavily from John Hughes and Sam Raimi, with likeable lead characters; "Night of the Living Dorks" is better drawn and acted than Hughes' "Weird Science" or many more-recent teenage horror flicks that attempt to copy Raimi's successful "Evil Dead" formula. The scares are played for laughs, and often quite successfully. The teen sex-farce elements are fairly innocuous and low-key, and fit logically into the story. I found myself liking this; it was certainly better than I expected.
$SUMMARY.: Better than expected

$review_text.: This workout is for your chest, shoulders, abs and quads


 For every exercise, you do about 10=30 reps per set, but if you use a heavy enough set of weights, you will feel the burn
 There are the usuall squats, push ups, chest flies - all totally designed for sculpting although there is a little bit of heart raising work

 Just like on The Biggest Loser, she's tough and she's trying to make sure you'll get results


 She's always yelling at you to push yourself harder

 She IS motivating


 The good bonus, is that at the end, there is some recipes and nutrition tips for you
 Overall, I really enjoyed this workout and was sore for days.

$review_text.: My friend dragged me see Bridesmaids against my better judgement. I had seen the Hangover and hated it, even though I usually like that kind of humor. Wow!  I wasn't expecting to see a laugh-out-loud, sensitive, tender, movie. Kristen Wiig plays Maya Rudolph's insecure Maid of Honor and is thrust into a group of Rudolph's other bridesmaids that she doesn't know well.  Megan, played by Melissa McCarthy (Molly & Mike) was especially funny and showed her wide range of acting skills in this movie.  I can't wait to purchase Bridesmaids and I know it's going to be one of those movies that I can watch over and over.

$review_text.: THE HUMAN STAIN met a mixed reaction when released in the theatres, possibly because the issues, which imbue this film with particular significance, got lost on the large screen that by nature concentrates on the BIG effect.  But on the DVD, viewed in the privacy of the home, the degrees of subtleties are more pronounced.  The indelible stain that birthright makes on our lives is examined in many facets in this adaptation of Philip Roth's rather sensational novel by the same name.  What effect does ethnicity have on molding our lives, what effect does the potential that inherited wealth will play on our view of the world, what effect can public prejudice as well as self-induced prejudice have on the way we process our adulthood roles?  This film addresses all of these issues: a Caucasian-appearing African American young man opts for costuming his life as a white Jewish scholar only to be dismissed from his professor's position because of a perceived 'racial slur' against absent black students; a young girl from a broken wealthy family sees through the vacuous existence when molested by a stepfather and runs into a life of poverty and personal tragedy desperately needing affection; a young writer becomes a recluse after the success of a first novel out of fear of flying; a visceral man enters madness induced by self-imposed exile.  Characters such as these put great demands on actors and it is very much to the credit of the screenwriter Nicholas Meyer and  director Robert Benton that the services of Sir Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Wentworth Miller, Anna Deavere Smith along with a fine supporting cast were captured to bring pulsating life to this difficult intermixing of stories.  Watch this one several times for the varying aspects of success in acting, in dialogue, and in the beautiful cinematic effects achieved in this very worthwhile film.

$REVIEW.: Election is a comedy about a High School election, but it is told primarily from the point-of-view of teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick). Scenes of teachers sabotaging their student's hopes and dreams out of bitter resentment for their own failures are a staple of the coming of age genre, but usually the teachers are just a minor speed bump on the major character's road to destiny. Here, the film stays with the teacher, who seems to be a decent fellow except for some major character flaws that make him do some pretty awful things.---------------Tracy Flick: It's like my mom says, "The weak are always trying to sabotage the strong."===============The source novel, "Election," by Tom Perrotta parallels Budd Schulberg's 1941 novel "What Makes Sammy Run?" In Schulberg's novel, an older writer (Al Manheim) watches young Sammy Glick run through the gauntlet of New York journalism and the Old Hollywood studio system. In "Election," Al Manheim = Jim McAllister + Sammy Glick = Tracy Flick.Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is perhaps a bit irritating in her relentless ambition, but she hardly merits the full-on vendetta unleashed by McAllister. Our sympathy shifts away from McAllister as we see that he has become somewhat fixated on thwarting Flick's ambitions due to his own frustrations. At first he merely avoids calling on her in class, though she is always first to raise her hand in response to any question. He could merely be trying to get more involvement and participation from some of the other students. When she runs for President unopposed his dislike of Tracy escalates to the next level, and he steps in to encourage a well-liked student, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run for President.---------------Tracy Flick: You might think it upset me that Paul Metzler had decided to run against me but nothing could be further from the truth. He was no competition for me; it was like apples and oranges. I had to work a little harder, that's all. See, I believe in the voters; they understand that elections aren't just popularity contests; they know this country was built by people just like me who work very hard and don't have everything handed to them on a silver spoon. Not like some rich kids who everybody likes because their fathers owns Metzlers cement and give them trucks on their 16th birthday and throw them big parties all the time. No, they don't ever have to work for anything. They think they can just all of a sudden one day out of the blue waltz right in with no qualifications whatsoever and try to take away what other people have worked very, very hard for their entire lives. No, it didn't bother me at all.===============A further complication is that Tracy Flick has had an affair with McAllister's friend and colleague, Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik). Dave was fired and his wife Linda (Delaney Driscoll) kicked him out. McAllister's wife and Linda were friends, so he ends up spending a lot of time helping Linda out, and begins to feel temptation. He starts an ill fated affair with Linda, sowing the seeds of his own destruction.As if that weren't enough crazy plot twists, Paul's sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) is in love to the point of obsession, but when her girlfriend breaks up with her and starts going out with Paul and becomes his campaign manager to spite her, she decides to run for President to spite them both. She is like the anarchist candidate, but as you might imagine, anarchy is very appealing to High School students. Her platform to dismantle the whole Student Body Government would probably carry the election, were she not more interested in just getting expelled and sent to an all-girl catholic school.Election is not a laugh-out-loud hilarious comedy, but it is more of a dark comedy, with a skewed world view. The director, Alexander Payne, was gearing up for greater success with Sideways, with its cast of even more flawed characters, obnoxious and unlikable, who grow on you, much like a fungus. Other notable films of Payne's are About Schmidt and Citizen Ruth.Also gearing up for greater success is Reese Witherspoon, who proved herself adept at comedy in the popular Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Alabama, then conquered drama with a well deserved Oscar for Walk the Line. She totally stole the show from Joaquin Phoenix, the ostensible star of the Johnny Cash biopic as June Carter Cash, Johnny's long suffering wife. In Election she stretches herself in several directions, running the gamut from A to Z, going from strident martinet to obnoxiously perky in a heartbeat.---------------Tracy Flick: [narrating] None of this would have happened if Mr. McAllister hadn't meddled the way he did. He should have just accepted things as they are instead of trying to interfere with destiny. You see, you can't interfere with destiny. That's why it's destiny. And if you try to interfere, the same thing's going to happen anyway, and you'll just suffer.===============DIRECTED BY ALEXANDER PAYNESideways(2004)About Schmidt(2002)Election (1999)Citizen Ruth(1996)FILMS AND ROLES OF MATTHEW BRODERICKFinding Amanda (2008) ....

$REVIEW.: This film together with "Bridge On the River Kwai" and "Lawrence of Arabia" represent a hattrick of director David Lean's best ever work as well as among the best films ever made.  Although "Lawrence of Arabia" is clearly the best of the three, "Doctor Zhivago is a close second.  This film has been described quite aptly as Russia's "Gone With the Wind" as the loves and lives of the people close to Doctor Zhivago gets told amid the backdrop of World War 1 and the Russian Revolution all the way to the Russia of the 60's.  No one can quite tell an epic story as well as David Lean does and his films are so good that they transcend time and as true classics should they age very well and hold up very well to repeated viewing.  The cast is excellent and so is the brilliant camerawork and the haunting score by Maurice Jarre.This dvd version is a real treat as the second disc is chockful of bonus extras like interviews with the cast and a good making of documentary while the main course on disc one has very good picture quality and especially good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound quality as well.  This dvd represents a remarkably well done restoration of the film which makes it an extremely enjoyable film in this day and age.  Even the digipak cardboard packaging is very well done and aesthetically appealing in design.If you are looking for David Lean's best work, you need look no further than "Lawrence of Arabia", this film and "Bridge On the River Kwai" and in that order.Highly recommended!Updated on 27 May 2011:As Amazon will not let me review this separately, I'll have to do this here:  The Blu-ray Book version is incredible!  The picture and especially the sound quality coming in DTS HD MA 5.1 surround sound are both much improved over the dvd version I reviewed above.  The booklet itself is very nice to behold and as well as the dvd version was you have to see this in Blu-ray as it's like watching a whole new film!  The greater picture and sound quality has to be experienced to be believed making this certainly worth the double dip.Very highly recommended!

$review_text.: My sister got this for my Dad for Christmas a few years ago for $10 at one of those Big Lots type places and because of the price I never borrowed it thinking it was low quality.  I borrowed it one Halloween and wasn't disappointed, it is close to Unsolved Mysteries but each episode is just short of 50 min.  It is in my Halloween rotation now.The box and cases themselves are nothing special, it's a plain box with each disk in a slim case, but I sometimes think DVD seasons are a little too fancy and take up a little too much space.  This is a 9 DVD set and for the size it takes up on a shelf it's great.A few things that this set didn't do well on:Video quality.  It gets a little grainy at times, not as bad as some DVDs but you really notice it if you have a HDTV.Chapter Markers.  One advantage about DVDs is the ability to skip intros so after the first one you don't have to see the opening for every episode.  Season 1, 2, and 3 had every episode as one chapter so if you hit skip then it went to the next episode.  Season 4 got it correct and when you hit skip once it went right into the story, skipping the intro.  I know some people don't care about this but when I watch TV I binge on it, watching a few DVDs or a few TV episodes on my Tivo device so skipping is important to me.Overall I think the acting and locations were alright but I took off one star for quality and one star for chapter markers.  I would still recommend it even with these small flaws.EDIT:  I want to add this is not the complete set, there are two movie length episodes that led to the production to these seasons.  They are 'A HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT' and 'A HAUNTING IN GEORGIA'.  One of them was made into a major motion picture so make sure you get the 'documentary' ones instead.  They come as a double feature DVD on Amazon, only $9.99, I'm going to get that and see what it's like.  I can't say much for them as I haven't watched them but I'm going to get them before next Halloween and update this review.

$review_text.: I think the writers made a big mistake with this one. Although I liked the character Tasha Yar a lot and didn't think she should have left, if they did have to kill her off, surely there are better ways than death by a  giant oil slick?Instead of her being killed honourably in the line of  duty, her death seemed meaningless and took a back seat to other events in  this episode, such as Troi being trapped in the shuttle, and Picard's  negotiation with the creature, Armus, itself.I've only forgiven The  Powers That Be because this was the first time a really major character got  killed off (Except for Spock who supposedly died in Wrath of Kahn and then  under went an amazing resurrection in Search for Spock). But then, Jadzia  Dax's death wasn't handled much better.The one nice bit about this  episode is Tasha's goodbye speech at the end, which was really sweet and  touching, and brought a breath of fresh air into an otherwise poor episode.  Other than that, it was an awful send off for a good character.  'Yesterday's Enterprise' was a much better attempt.I only got this  episode because I'm a collecter, and I'm a fan of the character Tasha Yar.  If you are neither, then I suggest you don't waste your money.

$REVIEW.: Robert Louis Stevenson (1850 - 1894) was a remarkable author from the Victorian Era. He has left us at least two masterpieces: "The Treasure Island" (1883) and "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (1886). Both of them have been used as original story to produce remarkable and not so remarkable filmic versions."Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" (1941) is one of the best translations from Stevenson's tale to screen. IMHO the changes made to the story for this version enhance the dramatic force of it.Dr. Jekyll suspect evil burdens every human soul, being an obstacle in its way to goodness. So he investigates and produces a drug that "liberates" the evil spirit and doing so he intend to be relived of it.He is in love with Beatrix Emery and wants to marry her. Unfortunately after expressing his ideas at a diner meeting, his father-in-law to be, decides take his daughter to France and let unfortunate Jekyll to abandon his "outrageous" ideas and focus on ordinary medical practice.After receiving this troublesome notice, Jekyll accidentally meets beautiful Ivy Peterson which disturbs his Victorian prudish notions.Griped by turmoil of emotions Jekyll decide to experiment his "liberating" potion on himself giving birth to Mr. Hyde, that instantly jumps into ruthless action.From this point on Evil starts to grow each time more powerful and Mr. Hyde end cornering Dr. Jekyll into impotence and fear.This cinematographic version emphasizes Freudian conceptualizations with some dreamlike scenes containing images full of erotic meaning.Spencer Tracy performance's as Dr. J./ Mr. H. is really top-notch, centered more in psychological aspects than in physical changes. Mr. H. unbounded brutality emanates from his corporal demeanor and not from the make-up.Ingrid Bergman is... well she is a dream. She melds innocence with voluptuosity; seduction with navet&eacute;. Some scenes may be judged risqu&eacute; for those times nevertheless she plays them with honors.A very young Lana Turner fleshes Beatrix in an anodyne performance.Joseph Ruttenberg's black & white pictures are almost expressionist recreating a fogyish London; he was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. He had already won one and will won more in the future.Director Victor Fleming is remembered for directing "Gone with the Wind" (1939), nevertheless even if he never repeated such allure he directed some excellent ones as this film, "The Wizard of  Oz" (1939) and "Joan of Arc" (1948).A Classic movie you shouldn't let passes by unheeded!Reviewed by Max Yofre.

$REVIEW.: We went to the midnight showing of CRYSTAL SKULL when it was released. Now, I am a fan from way back (I was 12 when the first one came out) and it's hard not to have huge expectations. My wife is from an entirely different generation and went in with no agenda at all. She loved it from start to finish while I couldn't fairly judge it because I was too busy waiting for it to go south. I slept on it and then we went back the next day and saw it again. Here's the deal... RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was a great film, nearly impossible to top. Interestingly enough, I thoroughly enjoyed the seond movie, TEMPLE OF DOOM, just as much (I was 15 and still full of imagination at that point.) By the time THE LAST CRUSADE rolled around, I was 20 years old and much less able to see things with child-like wonder. The third film wasn't as "magical" to me when I saw it in theaters. Recently, I rewatched all 3 and found that I loved them all- for very different reasons. RAIDERS will always be a great adventure film- lightning in a bottle. The other 2 are great adventures. The common thread is Indy- and if you love him, you love the films... all 4 of them. The second time I saw CRYSTAL SKULL, I didn't compare it to anything that came before. After all, it's an entirely different pop culture throwback- while the first 3 are take-offs on the movie serials of the 1930s and 1940s, the new one is a representation of the sci-fi B movies of the 1950s and, as such, it works perfectly. There are certainly a couple of moments where you shake your head (Lucas' tribute to TARZAN) but then you notice that the 8-year-olds in the audience are loving those parts. Harrison Ford turns in a virtuoso performance. He has refined Indy's character to reflect all the previous experiences we have witnessed. Indy has become like his own father in many ways (wise, experienced, confident and calm) and learned from his father's failings as well (when dealing with the younger Mutt, he is understanding, attentive and "cool.") Mutt's character is a welcome addition as is the return of Marion Ravenwood- Shia LaBoeuf and Karen Allen are both truly excellent. The supporting cast turn in solid performances as well. There are touches of humor and mystery throughout and the motorcycle chase and the grave-yard scene are on par with any of the action sequences from the first 3 films. All-in-all it was great to see old friends again and, for a little over 2 hours, to be 12-years-old again!

$REVIEW.: After seeing this I wanted to snatch my eyeball out of the sockett it was so stupid

I thought Angela Bettis was through torturing us after her horrible remake of "Carrie", but I guess not
If you're lonely, buy a dog, or try keeping a boyfriend and not scaring him off, but, by no means, do you begin to start killing people off and sewing their body parts together to make you a friend

This chick was seriously messed up

At any rate, I see all the rave reviews, and I don't understand it, but I guess I don't share the morbid imaginations


Afterall, I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be a cult classic


I just didn't like it though.

$REVIEW.: As a caveat, I completed the P90X program a few years ago, and I judge products like this one against that. That being said, while the P90X workouts focus (for the most part) on one part of the body (e.g., legs and back, abs), this RIPPED workout is more of an overall workout. Instead of an hour dedicated to one group of muscles, this one takes you from one to another to another in short (~5min) segments. You get into it just in time for them to change to a different area to focus on. It keeps you from getting bored or repeating the same moves multiple times, and it has some flexibility and rudimentary instruction for each segment that allows you to get it right and adjust for your own abilities and limitations. It has a bonus ab workout, also five minutes, which is really too limited to make a difference (P90X got it right with Ab Ripper X) but is okay for those trying to maintain rather than improve or tone. This is a decent workout, and it certainly is a nice change of pace from longer, single focus workouts.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this film I couldn't stop smiling. What I got was an explosion of color and music, Bollywood style, and sure some of the songs were okay, but hey, there were a few terrible numbers in Grease too, and I still love that movie!The lead players were all virtually unknown to me but they were perfect in their roles. The role of Lalita (the Elizabeth role in the original book) was perfectly cast - she was beautiful and she really held the whole movie together. And Martin Henderson was perfect as the American version of the disdainful Mr. Darcy, this time Mr. Will Darcy. The scene moves between Amritsar and Goa to London and Beverley Hills, all in brighter-than-bright super-saturated color, with an assortment of equally colorful characters, wonderful costumes, lavish dance pieces and heavenly bollywood-style ballads. While almost everything is in English (except for a few subtitled songs), nearly all the characters are top Indian performers.They had good dancers in Bride and Prejudice which is sumptuously choreographed musically with Indian dancing that has become nigh impossible with western dancers.Admittedly it's a bit cheesy at times - but it's self-consciously so, and as endearing as warm, gushy Indian hospitality. The sets and dialogue give authentic, if stereotypical, glimpses of Indian life and values. Like many east-meets-west movies, the stereotypes are a handle to allow easy assimilation of foreign ideas, and the heavy Indian involvement wards off any tendency to patronize (which is one of the themes explored in the film).This is not high drama or high art, but it's an accomplished romantic comedy / song-and-dance film, and one that warms the heart and makes you want to wave your arms in the air Indian-dance-style for the sheer joy and exuberance of happy endings. You can either rent or buy if you are open to something new - it really is quite a faithful re-work of the story, and it is very entertaining. The only people who won't enjoy this are people who hate musicals with a passion, or people who are purists to the original.

$review_text.: Adult fans of "G.I. Joe" toys, cartoons and comics books from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s won't find much to like about the mega-popular brand's latest incarnation, but its new fans will appreciate it.Compared to the classic 1980s Joe cartoons, there are few funny moments, very little characterization and no complexity among the villains. The classic arguments between the mercenary Destro and the megalomaniacial Cobra Commander are gone. A new part-robotic Cobra minion seems a likely competitor with Cobra Commander, proving that bad guys always fight among themselves, but his plot never gets going. Characters are just pawns for the video game story, which is satisfying on a visual level, but will be boring to anyone looking for much of a plot or even some cartoonish jibes among such formerly cranky and opinionated troops as Tunnel Rat, Heavy Duty, Scarlett and Snake Eyes.Boys who like the admittedly cool toys will dig watching the figures and toys at work. But only the most G.I. Joe-crazed of nostalgia fans will find these new Joes worthy of a watch. Gone is the potentially timely idea of a U.S. special-forces unit of well-trained but outmatched experts and soldiers fighting against an increasingly vicious, backstabbing, egotistical enemy terrorist force. 9/11 has done away with terrorists as a bad guy for kids, and now it's all anime-style battles and superhero costumes.

$REVIEW.: This classic Hammer horror, based on Bram Stoker's novel "Jewel Of Seven Stars" is perhaps most famous for the deaths of director Seth Holt and the wife of Peter Cushing, the movie's original lead- which inevitably led to reports of a curse on the production. Strangely this is R18 in NZ/Australia despite being PG in the US. BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY'S TOMB is pretty gory for its time, maybe Hammer studios felt Herschell Gordon Lewis had been stealing some of their thunder so they countered this with classier, big budget bloodletting.The plot revolves around archeologist Dr. Fuchs (Andrew Keir) who steals a ring of the Seven Stars from an Egyptian tomb. The only problem is it belonged to a Queen, and whoever wears the ring can bring death upon unsuspecting persons by gorily slashing their throats. Fuchs gives the ring to his sexy daughter Margaret (Valerie Leon) as a gift. Unfortunately,  the ring causes her to have nightmares; one of which features Queen Tera's severed hand being mauled by dogs; but still crawling along by itself with the precious ring still attached! Ironically, Margaret also has a scar encircling her wrist. Coincidence? Or could she be the reincarnation of Queen Tera?BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY'S TOMB is one of the best and obviously most notorious of Hammer's horror pictures. There's some great camera work, especially in the classic scene where an old geezer in a mental hospital is menaced by demonic forces. Valerie Leon's voluptuous breasts give two mesmirising supporting performances. She just oozes sex appeal. Followed by a feeble remake in 1980, THE AWAKENING starring Charlton Heston and Stephanie Zimbalist from TV's REMINGTON STEELE. Watch this instead. You''ll find it much more rewarding.

$review_text.: Having lived around the outskirts of Washington, D.C. myself, it's always a nice treat to watch a film that literally takes place right where I have stood, at one time or another. It's just very fun to know that a famous movie was shot where you once walked. (Although I now regret visiting the set of "101 Dalmations" in London--that's one story I don't often tell people with a smile on my face.)At the beginning of "No Way Out," we get to see Washington from above as the camera glides through the air, swerving and going around in circles, until we land inside a small interrogation room housing a convicted murderer (Kevin Costner), who is in fact innocent and has been framed. "When's he coming out?" he asks as he walks over to a one-way mirror and looks through the glass. Right as we start to think, "Whom is he talking to?" (Or "Does he mean Hackman?" if you've read anything about the film), we fall backwards in time and land in the same place some number of months earlier."No Way Out" is a government thriller about an officer wrongly accused of murder--when the Secretary of State himself is the culprit trying to avoid a scandal by launching a top-secret cover-up. Costner is the officer, and Gene Hackman is the Secretary of State. After meeting a beautiful young woman (Sean Young) at a party, Costner takes her into a limo and they have a quickie--before they even know each other's names.What's this got to do with anything? Why is my review so choppy and linear-challenged? We'll get there.The relationship between the two turns into a big romance until Costner is sent out to sea, where he saves a sailor from falling overboard and is praised in all the papers--where his girlfriend back home sees his face and is reminded of him. (Now she's the mistress of Hackman, by the way--that complicates matters quite a bit.)When he arrives back home, they go on a romantic getaway--but Hackman finds out and accidentally murders the girl while trying to get her to tell him the name of her lover. Ready to turn himself in, Hackman is persuaded by his gay friend to cover everything up and blame someone else. The gay man even goes and gets rid of the evidence himself--with pride, I might add. (It's like Mr. Burns and Smithers from "The Simpsons"--the latter loves the former, but the former is too powerful and naive to ever notice.)The clever twist in "No Way Out" is that Costner knows Hackman killed Young, but Hackman doesn't know that he knows that. (Get it?) As he runs around the Pentagon and other government establishments, the evidence starts to pile up against him--the negative off the back of a Polaroid camera, a few eyewitnesses who claim they saw a man outside Young's apartment the night of her murder, etc.The great thing about "No Way Out," and another factor that separates it from the rest of its kind, is something that's hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen the film. Essentially, no one knows who killed the girl--and Costner isn't placed under arrest straight away because no one has uncovered any evidence pointing towards him. As the negative off the back of the Polaroid is scanned through a computer and painstakingly altered to reveal the man's face on the photo, Costner runs around trying to eliminate evidence before anyone finds out. The photo will eventually reveal his own face, yes, but he has a number of hours until then to find the true evidence that convicts Hackman.This is a smart thriller with a few pleasant twists, particularly the very end. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's well-acted and solidly directed by Roger Donaldson, who also made last year's "The Recruit" with Al Pacino and Colin Farrell. The guy obviously likes government thrillers. This one is a lot more plausible than "The Recruit," too.

$review_text.: The Bourne Identity directed by Doug Liman was excellent.  However, this second installment, The Bourne Supremacy, is not filmed by the same director and it makes all of the difference in the world.The movie overall is ok, but it can't hold a candle to the first one.  The main reason for my dismay at this movie is the choice made by director Paul Greengrass to use handheld cameras almost exclusively.  In every scene, the camera appears to be wiggling around.  It gives the film a cheap look - as if it was filmed with a bargain bin camcorder.I understand the use of this technique when Bourne is running, or during a car chase.  But through the whole movie?  Give me a break!  It makes the film difficult to watch, and is just downright annoying at times.If you get motion sickness easily - be prepared!
$SUMMARY.: not the same director as Bourne Identity - and it shows...

$REVIEW.: The 3 hour version of this film is perfectly in accordance with the Gospel of John. I was able to follow the movie almost word for word in my bible (as least in context/spirit). The times I didn't read along, I found myself asking (more than once) "The bible doesn't say that, does it?", and sure enough, it did - and I had read John a couple of times!! The acting was more than adequate with some irritating exceptions (noted below), but overall I enjoyed the enthusiasm and fire that the actor brought to this Jesus. Mostly, I enjoyed the accuracy and the different perspective compared with reading in regards to when narration was taking place vs. Jesus speaking and to whom.So, what's the exception? Well...where my bible would quote Jesus as saying "I solemnly tell you" or "I assure you", this movie each and every time translated all of those types of statements into "I tell you the truth!!" - but the actor did it in a way that sounded argumentative, annoyed and/or whiney, not in a reassuring or confident way or making a statement as fact, but rather as he was trying too hard to convince his listener. And other parts he seemed almost arrogant, condescending and smug. Assuredly, this is not the type of feeling I get in my heart when Jesus comes to me personally! If this is not your introduction to Jesus and you can get past these flaws, you'll totally love this.

$review_text.: It is unfortunate &quot;Fushigi Yugi&quot; went to two full seasons.  The first season -- all represented in this 'Suzaku' volume -- was a triumph of imagination and story telling.  There is hardly a wasted episode, and the character development is outstanding.  This DVD set alone would be almost worth getting if you never watched the second season.Of course, that's silly... you'll want to finish it.  Only you may find the second season to be significantly inferior to the first.  Don't let that dissuade you from buying this collection.  You'll want to watch it for the imagery, for the music, for the drama.  Several times.  Share it with your friends.  Show them anime isn't just for little kids.FY represents the best of what anime is all about -- engaging story lines that make you feel.  Characters who struggle, succeed, fail, and sometimes die.  The heroic and the diabolical, and those in-between ones you are never quite sure about.  The mundane and the mystic.  Sure, it loses its way in the Seiryu volume.  No matter.  The magic is here, in the possibilities and potentials.  You won't regret FY Volume 1.

$REVIEW.: Hallelujah, it's raining Men!Oh, and women too

Literally.Pity poor, monstrous, ruined, bloodthirsty Victor Crowley (the great Kane Hodder, channeling Eric Stoltz from "Mask"): born into this cruel and grasping age looking for all the world like a pig with Down's Syndrome stuck by a mad scientist into a combination blender/teleporter with the little unwanted mutant baby from "Eraserhead".Born into this! Yes, Born into this!, as Bukowski once said

And then smacked in the face with a hatchet because he had a really bad case of ADHD (they parented differently back then, spare the rod and all).Supposedly he's dead, but the Cajun fishermen tell tales of hearing him cry out for this father from the ruins of their little abandoned cabin up in the cypress swamps on a moonless night."Hatchet" bills itself as "old school American horror", and its eye-catching publicity posters (and DVD art) promised as much: the starkness of the hatchet front and center, its stony, unyielding surface smeared with sticky red blood, a primal sigil of destruction, all sharp, hard, brutal lethality contrasted against a backdrop of inky night.That might suggest simplicity, starkness, perhaps raw terror, to you
It might suggest raw, primal grue

Perhaps a stripped down screenplay, a kind of rippling, insurgent savagery and, Hell, mebbe even a scare or two

You might be forgiven for thinking this was something new, something revolutionary; I did.We would be wrong."Hatchet" is to Scary what a palace eunuch is to Macho
It is a deeply, deeply stupid movie, that manages to 1) take the relatively simple horror movie chore---deliver the boneheaded cardboard characters to the swampy anvil of death---and transform it into an hour of painfully contrived, brain-blasting tedium; 2) squander the talents of horror vets Robert Englund and Tony Todd in scenes both tedious and cringingly unfunny
The first hour of "Hatchet" is the cinematic equivalent of injecting yourself into "Flowers for Algernon": you can just feel yourself getting stupider.But once the psycho fodder hits the swampy turf---& the resident Psycho (played to beefy, uh, perfection bybeefy psycho vet Kane Hodder) shows up to, er, bury the Hatchet---things get redder, and goopier, and gorier.You're missing nothing if you just FF to the goods: the sheer, unapologetic brutality of the flick (chick! hiya! chick, meet drill sander!), and the generous helpings of the goopy red stuff, at which it's pretty much by the numbers & on the bounce: psycho fodder shriekds, runs and hides

Mutant freak finds, slices, and dices
Rinse, repeat.Bottom line: all the marks I take away for the sheer blain-blasting stupidity of this thing, I must restore for sheer enthusiasm
Sheer, wild-eyed, gore & brain splattered exuberance counts for a lot in jihad, porn, and horror movies, and Adam Green delivers it in spades once his monster shows up with his own rendition of the Big Easy.If nothing else, it's worth checking out just to see what amounts to a fully ambulatory, totally ripped Elephant Man in overalls come bounding down a bridle path, hatchet in hand rendered teeny by the Beast's gigantism, and give a little Tomahawk Chop right to the ol' shoulder-blade of some shrieking geezer

And what a Chop!Anyway for all the goop and gore, this film also has a great message
Three of them, in fact:HATCHET GREAT MORAL #1: if it's raining in New Olreans and all the levee done broke and we got no place to go, brotha, they's worse places to be (like in da Hootchee swamp with a hatchet wielding maniac out).HATCHET GREAT MORAL #2: There are worse things in Louisiana than Katrina, FEMA, and gators.HATCHET GREAT MORAL #3: When you were a kid did ya get hit with the Ugly Stick? Get even---get a sharper one and hit back!JSG

$REVIEW.: SHOPGIRL works on a number of levels.  While its focus is an examination between types of romance, it also manages to address many issues of the isolation of living alone in Los Angeles - or any big city for that matter.  But Los Angeles, with its sprawl of ill-defined suburbs and neighborhoods searching for a city's identity, a city where a lot of lonely people mount the freeways daily to drive to unfulfilling jobs that merely keep their lives together, snuffing out many possibilities of  life enhancing experiences, is the perfect fit for Steve Martin's screenplay adaptation of his very Los Angeles novella by the same name.Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes), an immigrant wannabe artist from Vermont lives alone with her distant cat Sylvia in Silver Lake, one of the borderlands of LA, and drives her pickup to Saks Fifth Avenue daily to work the glove counter. Most of her day is spent daydreaming while watching fellow sexy worker Lisa (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) charm the customers with fragrances.  She meets another loner Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), an unkempt, broke, but good-spirited youth her age in a Laundromat and the mutual needs of both characters opens a strange but sweet romance overture.  But simultaneously Mirabelle meets the wealthy 50-something divorced Ray Porter (Steve Martin in a subdued, no pratfalls role) and Ray immediately but subtlely  begins sending gifts and dates and surprises Mirabelle's way, resulting in a 'perfect courtship' in her eyes but intended as a no strings sexual outlet in Ray's view.  The story is one that compares the May/December high-class romance with the more sensitive and realistic wobbly romance between two young needy people and the manner in which it resolves feels right.Danes is superb in this delicate role as are Schwartzman, Martin, and Wilson-Sampras. Director Anand Tucker keeps the story flowing naturally, as 'natural' as he can with the writer and actor being the one with the clout.  Each of the sections of this monopoly game of courtship is well played until the lugubrious musical score by Barrington Pheloung  pushes toward the maudlin.  But in all, this is a fine little film, beautifully acted, with a lot of important information about life and love in the loneliness of a big city.  Grady Harp, April 06

$review_text.: Don't say you're not interested in Klaus Nomi.  If you never heard of him, it doesn't matter.  If you want to hear something unique and extraordinary, here's Nomi, whose genre-defying, mind-bending mixture of styles is simply captivating.  And here's a documentary about his tragic short life, which itself is as captivating as his songs.Born Klaus Sperber in Germany, Nomi became part of New Wave movement in New York in the late 70s.  And his eccentric style is still amazing to see.  Tightly clad in the bizarre costumes coming directly from grade-B sci-fi films with completely white-wasked face, Nomi appears as if giving an oracle, and when he starts to sing, what a song!  His is curious blend of pop and opera with beautiful falsetto.  He is literally a singing alien.This documentary consists of the interviews with those how knew Nomi. What is revealed here may not be surprising to the viewers who have some knowledge about Nomi, but to the people like me, who are interested in the 70-80s, the comments and footages about him and the surrounding NY club scenes are still precious.  Sure, most of the footages are private films with bad image and sound quality, but they still vividly bring the feeling of the times to life.Probably the most interesting moment in the film would be the song of David Bowie on Saturaday Night Live in 1979, in which Klaus Nomi appears one of the backsingers.  Clearly this is, or should be, the turning of Nomi's career, and after this point, many interviewees, quite honest about Nomi's complex personality, are not always kind to his behaviors.Though Nomi is gone forever, his originality can be still felt if you watch the film.  With the lack of some materials (for instance, Bowie or the artists in Japan who briefly worked with him), and with less than satisfactory comments from Nomi himself, 'The Nomi Song' may not be as incisive as it should be, but still intriguing even for non-fans of Nomi.  Watch this, and buy his CDs if you want something very different.

$review_text.: I love the Fifth Doctor, but this was not one of the better stories if his era.In this DVD, some visual and audio fx are missing in part 4 where people are apparently shot by Daleks yet make pitiful sounding screams, no audio or visual for the blast.  It looks like a total farce when it should be a disturbing slaughtering.The plot is also way too contrived, also pointlessly featuring an eventual invasion of Gallifrey (ugh) and throwing in a pointless clipshow of all the Doctor's previous companions, except for Leela of course.  (ugh)Also, they shove a Dalek out of the second floor of the warehouse where it crashes outside.  For the rest of the warehouse scenes, the Dalek's bits are scattered throughout the INSIDE of the warehouse, nor suggesting anybody was stupid enough to move the wreckage inside...And did the Supreme Dalek really have duplicates of all the world's major leaders in place to cause the destablization of Earth?!Why does Stein do any number of things to help the Doctor when he apparently was a Dalek Duplicate ordered to capture the Doctor?!Tegan's leaving scene almost makes up for this rubbish, but she claimed her travels stopped being fun.  If you looked at a handful of adventures  (threatened with rape, mind taken over by a malevolent entity - TWICE, threatened to be killed, interrogated by a lizard after watching "The HitchHiker's Guide to the Galaxy" thinking the Doctor - like Ford Prefect - came from Guildford, always complaining about the Doctor's inability to get her home, and so on, it didn't come across as being fun...)This also has a 5.1 remix for the audio.  While the DVD menu is nothing less than brilliant, the re-mix for the story itself is an embarrassment.  Which is sad as the 5.1 remix for "The Five Doctors" special edition was superb by comparison.If Warner Bros would release the following stories, I'd be a happier customer:THE TWO DOCTORS (whose features alone will make it an instant purchase for me, but the story is very good too!)THE SEEDS OF DEATH (an excellent story)EARTHSHOCK (another excellent story)THE THREE DOCTORS (may as well finish up the ___ Doctors stories but this one is entertaining)andTHE CURSE OF FENRIC (which I originally hated but has grown on me since)I know other fans will be happy over "The Talons of Weng Chiang" which is about to be released, but that one always bored me.  As for "The Dalek Invasion of Earth", it's got nice outdoor location work but the plot and the final two episodes are so slapdashed and haphazerdly written that I can't ignore them, forget the part that the Daleks want to turn the Earth into a mobile spacecraft when they can already make their own.

$REVIEW.: If you're as fed up with mainstream American horror as I am, you can do a lot worse than &quot;Anatomy&quot; as an evening's entertainment.  But then again, you can do a whole lot better.  It was refreshing to see sprightly young Franka Potente (&quot;Run Lola Run&quot;) as the intelligent, virginal female protagonist, but other than her presence, this movie doesn't have a whole lot going for it.Potente plays Paula, a student headed off to a prestigious medical school to study anatomy, and no sooner does she arrive than fellow students start getting knocked off (surprise, surprise).  The movie indulges too much in obnoxious college stereotypes (the hunk, the shy guy, the creepy guy, the slut) for me to enjoy it, although the subsequent live human dissections are impressive, effects-wise.  The dubbing is a hoot, and probably the film's strongest virtue.Unfortunately, despite &quot;Anatomy&quot;'s foreign roots, it's as derivatively American as &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,&quot; what with its dim-bulb college students, the emphasis on said students wanting to get laid, and relatively conservative gore factor.  On top of that, we get an unspectacular, sketchily-drawn murderer who spends most of the movie shuffled in the background.If you're looking for true foreign horror, go with something by Argento or Fulci.  &quot;Anatomy&quot; is an admirable attempt that tries too hard to be mainstream, but is worth seeing on the basis of Potente, an actress who--with the right script--can leave you spellbound.

$review_text.: This is a rather bland drama that was obviously born as a made-for-TV Canadian movie. It was transferred from TV without editing. Even the fades that would have surrounded commercial breaks have been left in. Since it was designed to be aired to general audiences, it has a certain unrealistic Cleaver Family patness.However, there are certain points about the movie that make it worth watching. For one thing, we get to see a documents examiner at work. That branch of forensics usually doesn't figure in our TV CSI shows, which generally feature only the more sensational aspects of criminal investigations."The Devil's Teardrop" has a good, resonant title - and an interesting ending. So I didn't mind too much that what came in the middle of this sandwich had a bit of the flatness of processed cheese.

$review_text.: This was a very pleasant surprise, far better than I had ever hoped, filled with fabulous cinematography and riveting story about the life of arms dealer during the 1980s and '90s.. Those who appreciate an interesting story and great visuals will like this one.Nicholas Cage was terrific as the lead character, "Yuri Orlov." I loved his narration, too. How much of what he said is true, I have no idea, but it's fascinating stuff.I felt those visuals, combined with the outstanding acting and always-interesting story made this a good film. It also proved you don't need action every two minutes to keep a film involving for the audience. This has just the right amount of drama, suspense, action, romance and, yes, even humor.I do have to warn some that the message is a pessimistic one: that evil always wins in the world. According to Bible of "Yuri," in the end, the meek won't inherit the earth; the arms dealers will and that evil rules, so why fight it and yourself over it? Wow, what uplifting words to live by.Outside of Yuri's wife "Ava" (Bridget Moynahan) and the man who pursues him, "Jack Valentine" (Ethan Hawke) no one in here has much in the way of high-ground morals. At least they made the lawman an honest; that's rare in films today.Amir Mokri is the cinematographer and Andrew Niccol, the director, who combined to make this movie look so stylish and beautiful to see. Looking at Mokri's resume, I see he's done a number of stylish films. Niccol hasn't directed much but what he has also offers interesting visuals.Looking at the front and back cover of the DVD might make you think this is just another of these brainless action flicks, but it is not. This is solid film, despite the pessimism.

$review_text.: I watched "Indoctrinate U" ... and watched it, and watched it, and watched it.  The director/author telling the story of someone who got into trouble for saying something.  The person in question explaining what happened.  The director/author, camera trailing behind, attempting to find someone from the relevant university who can explain what happened from the university's perspective (e.g., threatening a student with expulsion for putting up a flier to promote a speech by a conservative African American author promoting a book that's called "It's OK to Leave the Plantation", the problem being that another student found herself "offended" by the word "plantation").  Then the d/a telling, person explaining, d/a attempting.  Again and again.  The point of the film is, of course, essentially a valid one, but I would have liked a bit less repetitiveness and much tighter editing.  I also have to add that I find myself of two minds about the matter at hand.  The film goes into some length about the fact that there are many universities in America at which a huge percentage of professors are registered Democrats, and hardly any are registered Republicans.  This makes me wonder.  If there is organized and institutionalized discrimination against conservative professors (and one of the key figures in Indoctrinate U is a female professor who undergoes simply astonishing harassment when she is outed as a Republican), then that is a problem.  But I cannot help also feeling that perhaps the majority are on the side of the angels, so to speak.  Perhaps a majority of people who undergo a thorough education from kindergarten through graduate and post-graduate work do come to a liberal understanding, at least in the sense that American sociopolitical debate defines liberal and conservative.  Next, the documentary makes much fun of speech codes at universities.  Here, again, I have to wonder.  Some of those that were presented in the video were woolly and nonsensical, indeed.  But it does seem to me that a university campus would not be a better place in any sense of the word if everyone were absolutely free to use the perjorative words which bigots apply to persons of color, gay people, persons of different ethnicities, etc.  If the aim is to make sure that no student is attacked for reasons of his or her basic existence, then that makes sense to me.  Of course, I also accept the point that is made in "Indoctrinate U" -- that this can go beyond ridiculousness, and if someone is "offended" enough by the word "plantation" to get another student almost booted out of school, that runs close to lunacy.  But societies do establish compacts, whether written or unwritten, of behavior, and speech is part thereof.  Every journalism student in the history of America has learned that freedom of speech is not an absolute concept.  The classic example given is the person who stands up and shouts "fire" in a crowded movie theater.  But I also do not feel that I or anyone should have the right to loudly describe black people as n*ggers, gay people as f*ggots, Italians as w*ps, Jews as k*kes, etc.  I cannot see a problem with a university proscribing such language.  Another key character in "Indoctrinate U" is an Indian student who writes a conservative editorial and is attacked by a fellow member of the university community as a "raghead" and a "terrorist."  The idea is that the student was attacked for being a conservative.  But would the same not be true if he had written a radically liberal editorial and someone had called him a "raghead" and a "terrorist"?  Is it not simply a question of racist attack?  This is not an easy review to write, because I really do see the issue from both sides and believe that I would probably be pretty uncomfortable to see five white frat boys in blackface pretending to be the Jackson 5 (another key episode in the video), but I do think that "Indoctrinate U" is, in some ways, as close to the line of demagoguery as anything that Michael Moore has produced, particularly in the fairly lengthy episode in which the director/author goes on a search for "men's studies" departments at the various universities which he visits.  Perhaps this would have been less so if the director/author had also gone to any of America's self-defined "Christian" universities and taken a look at what happens to freedom of speech when eager-beaver conservativism gets its hands on it.  But then again, that might have been a different documentary -- albeit one with the same point.  "Indoctrinate U" -- interesting, but a bit too much.

$review_text.: The 12th entry to the James Bond series pits Bond against a Greek thug under the employ of the USSR. They are both searching for a device that manipulates the course of British war submarines and this could mean a very dangerous advantage for the east if they got their hands on it. Unfortunately, that's a lot of more exciting than it sounds in this unremarkable and forgetable thriller.The main villian, named Kristatos and played by Julian Glover, is just as bland as Stromberg or Drax; He has no real passion or sadism. Though the action pieces are less outrageous, they are still comical in nature and un-remarkable in their inventiveness. I liked the fact that the ATAC device was essentially like the "Lecktor" cipher in 1963's From Russia With Love but the film dosen't do enough to make us care that it's important. Yes, we all know the Russians want it and why but their perticipation in this film is barely noticable. Why couldn't we have Russian thugs after Bond instead of having the major threat being just a middleman ? They tried to aim with a "Cold War" plot but they gave us none of the politics.The Cold War plot is not the only thing that was wasted in this film. Carole Bouquet stars as Melina Havelock who's parents were murdered because of their involvement in the retrival of the ATAC device. Melina Havelock was based on Judy Havelock from Ian Fleming's short story "For Your Eyes Only", one of two short stories that was the basis of this film with the other being "Risico". Havelock's role pretty much is the same, she is out to seek revenge for the death of her parents. However here Melina is re-written more politically correct, she impales a few people in her quest for vengance and she never goes beyound a one-dimensional character. Bond tries to warn her a grand total of two times about vengance, once when they first encounter each other and at the finale when Melina has Kristatos in her cross hairs. Why did Bond encourage her to persue this vendetta and on the same token discourages her from persuing her parents' killers ? This was substance that was not explored.This is a very standard action film and a very rountine thriller. The only solid part of this film, and probably some of the best in a Bond film ever, was when the Risico story was exploited when Bond was tailing Columbo. After that, the film falls right back down into the depths of banality. Sure, Moonraker was dumb but at least it wasn't boring like For Your Eyes Only.

$REVIEW.: Steve Guttenberg stars in this 1984 comedy directed by Hugh Wilson and featuring Kim Catrall (TV's Sex and the City, Crossroads).  Guttenberg plays a man, not caring about life and doing nothing.  After he almost destroys a car he gets a choice: Go to jail or go to the police academy.  If he quits, he goes to jail.  However, if someone throws him out he will go back to his normal life.  And as much pranks Guttenberg pulls, he still cant get himself out.  Then he realizes that maybe being a police officer isn't the worst job in the world.  This was the movie that started it and that would go on to have five sequels.  Perhaps the first one of the series is the best one though it's the only one rated R.  It's a very entertaining movie with a lot of laughs.  My favorite characters were definetely Mahoney (Guttenberg), Hightower(Bubba Smith), and Barbara (don't know his name) who sadly didn't appear in the sequel, Police Academy 2:  Their First Assignment.

Giamatti is brilliant in showing the internal struggle and the effect of outside pressures with/on our 2nd President. I must admit, I had only rudimentary knowledge of John and Abrigal Adams...(you know, History 101). The story line not only kept my interest, but spurred my desire to learn more more these two incredible people.  I was entralled with the portrayal on the events leading to Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution. Needless to say I have pre-ordered this DVD and I went out an bought McCullough's book.Two thumbs up! (I'd give it 3 thumbs up, but that would be weird.)

$REVIEW.: Here's a guy who was a movie genius, who wrote, directed and starred in his own films, and who created a character of universal humor and gentleness. I'm not talking about Chaplin or Keaton, but about Jacques Tati. The character he plays in all his movies (only six in 25 years!) is M. Hulot, a tall, gangling innocent of a man who continually finds himself in situations that bemuse him. My Uncle is probably the best of the films to introduce yourself to him, if you haven't already met.Hulot's sister, brother-in-law and nephew live in an excruciatingly modern, fashionable, cold and uncomfortable house in Paris. There's not a gadget they don't have and there's a button to push for every gadget. The adults seem to have everything except an appreciation of what life is for and an understanding of what their little boy needs. Hulot lives atop a strange apartment house in a colorful part of Paris where everyone knows each other and foibles are accepted. Hulot moves through life seemingly without purpose, but he finds small ways to help others and to enjoy what life brings. How his sister and her husband are determined to bring Hulot into the modern life of ambition and goals is part of the story. How Hulot helps his nephew cope and ultimately brings about a change in the kid's parents is the other part.All this is shown with little dialoque. Tati builds his movie(s) around meticulously planned, step-by-step sight gags, although sight gag is too coarse a phrase for what he accomplishes. Things happen that may make you smile, later you realize they're part of what you're now seeing that makes you laugh.Some people think M. Hulot's Holiday is better than My Uncle, some think not. Well, the point is that they are both great movies. In one way or another all of Tati's movies are great. This one is very funny and very affecting.If you think Chaplin is a great film artist, and most people do, you owe it to yourself to become acquainted (if you aren't already) with another.The DVD transfer is excellent and the extras well worth watching...but don't watch them until after you see the film. The discussions about how Tati builds his visual humor will take some of the surprises away if you watch them first.

$review_text.: After a long delay, I finally have seen Sin City.  The film is undeniably a visual masterpiece.  The movie looks unlike anything I have ever seen.  I will preface the rest of the review this, I am not familiar with Frank Miller's stories.  I cannot imagine that the movie watcher has to have any familiarity with the content, but I have not.  I usually love movies like this, like Pulp Fiction.  However, I just could not get into this movie at all.I was not put off by the non-ending violence, but what is the point?  The characters are stale and there is not one person in the movie worthy of emotional investment.  The movie plays like a visually stunning gore filled yawn.  After the two hours were over I did not care one way or the other about the characters.  I am sure there will be more tales from Sin City, but unless there is more character development, I think I will pass.

$REVIEW.: Okay if you have to do a comparison between these two movies which one had the more unbelievable story?  A bunch of drunken oil refiners going into space to drill an asteroid to save the world or, actual astranauts going into space to blow one up?  Come on people.  Overall this movie has most of what is needed to make a great movie.  Fanstatic actors (Morgan Freeman is great as the president), great effects of the east coast being destroyed again (what movie doesnt destroy the east coast of the US in one way or another), Great feelings of humanity which is so badly lacking in most disaster flicks.  I mean who cares if the world blows up if there are no characters to sympathise with? (Aka Independance day, Armageddon, The Night of the Comet... so many to list here).  Dont be so harsh on this movie until you see the rest of the trash that is out there.  By comparison, this movie shines and I do highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: OK
I know everyone loved Amour


I'd put off watching it until last week because I didn't want to see Jean Louis Trintignant at 82 rather than his lovely 36 years in A Man and A Woman
I streamed Amour via Amazon and then had to rewatch the Man&Woman; race scenes to clear my head.All that aside, I have to say I hated Amour for reasons far more important than the loss of physical beauty

It was boring


Interminable

I mean, this is a story about an intelligent woman, a strong woman, a determined woman

And yet, what does she do when, at the advanced age of 82 she has a stroke and begins the long final slide into incontinence and incompetence? She just slides

Did she think she would never die? Or that she would be hit by a bus and that would be that? It appears she did not think at all


And once she has the first warning stroke, does she order in a bottle of Seconal and fifth of gin? No

She does nothing but show some irritation at her increasing limitations.And meanwhile, the ancient husband Jean Louis is rushing around preparing meals and changing her nappies and protecting her from all outside their closely held world
Claustrophobia anyone? This thing grinds on for over 2 hours


I've read many who say it was beautiful


What was beautiful about it?My suggestions for a remake: 1


Cut it to 90 minutes
2
Give the first hour over to a celebration of their life together, show fabulous music, and parties, and friends


Show joy and devotion

3


With 30 minutes to go, she has the stroke
Goes to the hospital


Learns the procedure for repair failed
Knows she's on her way out

4


Finally, for the last ten minutes, we see her still able to mix a drink (the above mentioned combo)and she wheels herself into the grand living room full of friends
Her pupils play the piano for her

She sips her cocktail and, smiling, closes her eyes

No one notices she's gone but the camera.

$REVIEW.: Those people who panned this series, gave it only 1 or 2 stars are absolutley correct: Burns shows his limited, biased view of jazz by virtually ignoring everything that came after 1961.But, acknowledging the truth of that grave shortcoming, the series still is, for what it is, well-done and entertaining.  It's not anything near an objective, comprehensive or even "fair" history of jazz, but -- it's jazz -- and that's all the title says it is.Consider, too, that the personalities Burns chose, the biographies and sociology of the times he chose to focus in on, all these things must have been very, very hard to resist.  While there are many great jazz performers post-1961, do they and the times they lived in compare to the drama and poignancy of what jazz was prior to 1960?  Are the personalities as magnetic or as relevant, not just from a musical point of view but from an historical/sociological point of view?Also, let's not expect too much from Ken Burns in terms of insightful, courageous filmmaking.  Far from it.  He's PBS' boy: he's their piano player, he just works there -- for PBS and its many corporatist sponsors.  So to the degree jazz is radical, subversive and a danger to the status quo, well, Ken Burns or PBS'll have no part of it.  They play it safe.  Why?  Because as Willie Sutton would put it: "That's where the money is."PBS knows exactly what they're going to get when they sign Burns on.  And if you think that "Burns' America" is going to be anything but mythology, then you haven't been paying attention to what PBS has become.PBS' charter, way back when it started in the late 1960s, specifically stated that it would offer programming not available on commercial television.  Now, given that pledge they made back in the 70s, look at how pathetic PBS has become. ... Cary Grant movies. ... Music programs of washed-up rock and roll singers who couldn't get on commercial teeveee nowadays with a car full of gangsters and three brigades of agents ... Biographies of Mario Lanza, Bobby Darin and, get this, 70s talk show host Mike Douglas! (Talk about scraping the bottom of the barrel).So Ken Burns knew just what he was doing.  How wonderful it is for all these "cruise missile liberals" (not a radical bone in their body) talking about race way, WAY after it took any kind of real courage to talk about it.  Oh, how they flock to tell us about *past* racial injustices; and how assiduously they ignore current political maladies.No, Ken Burns in their boy, that's for sure.  So, for sure, "Jazz" is highly entertaining, but do I expect Burns, in league with PBS, to do anything more than entertain?  Of course not.  Burns is a safe liberal and knowing how PBS has caved every time anyone has offered anything to the left of "safe liberalism," what he produces here is simply par for his course: entertaining, arbitrary, ingratiating and sacharrine.

$review_text.: This has always been one of my favorites and this DVD does not disappoint. A very clean version in glorious black and white. The whole film is one skit after another in a big hotel about Stanley/Jerry (without saying a word until the very end) messing up one way or another. No running plot, but it works!The audio commentary could be better, especially since Jerry Lewis did it himself. Steve Lawrence apparently was part of the commentary team because he laughs at everything Jerry says or does in the film. He added nothing to the commentary. But still, I'm grateful to have Jerry's comments about anything at all on the film, such as how he found the people to work and act in the film. His comments regarding Stan Laurel (his double appeared throughout the film) were quite nice.There are also a lot of other extras ("Archival Materials"): movie trailer, rehearsal clips, blooper, dropped scenes, promo clips. There's even some home video (with commentary by Jerry's son) on Jerry's bus tour around the country to promote the film.For the price, this is a real keeper for a Jerry Lewis fan.

$REVIEW.: In Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, we view from a distance and up close a number of people trapped in their lives:  the struggling songwriter, the woman looking for companionship, the salesman and his invalid wife, and a photographer confined to a wheelchair following an accident, looking at all the other trapped people through his window into theirs.  James Stewart is that photographer, a man who has become more of a voyeur than he wants to admit.  He's feeling trapped by his wheelchair, but also by his relationship with beautiful rich girl, Grace Kelly.  And then he begins to suspect that one of the neighbours has committed a murder, and from his perch at his window, he begins to piece it altogether.  Rear Window is an amazing film.  Like he was in Lifeboat, Hitchcock is limited to a small physical space to play out his action, and he does it here with even more success.  The suspense, the suspicions, and the evidence builds gradually in a plot perfectly paced for maximum effect.  Stewart gives a very assured performance here, just as effective in his reaction shots as he is delivering dialogue.  Kelly is sophisticated, beautiful, and very real in her performance, and both are matched by the always great Thelma Ritter as the to-the-point nurse who visits daily, and who also becomes involved in the goings on.  This is clearly one of Hitchcock's top achievements - a smart, romantic, sexy, funny, scary, mystery film that delivers on all those levels.  Make a point to see this one!

$REVIEW.: Wanted is a well thought out, action-packed thriller that centers around Wesley Gibson, a young man whose life is on a course parallel to that of a Charlie Brown storyline. He holds a corporate dead-end job with a boss who does not respect him and has a girlfriend who has been cheating with, of all people, his very best friend. Adding to his troubles are what he perceives to be a continual series of anxiety attacks that he tries to treat with prescribed medications; little does he know that these physical states that he has been trying to treat are actually rare, genetic gifts passed down from his father who abandoned him when he was an infant. What were thought to be handicaps that would induce psychotic states that might affect his performance on the job and in life are to be discovered as superhuman, albeit mutant, characteristics once Wesley encounters the lovely Fox, an assassin who holds the secret to the fate of Wesley's father as well as that of Wesley himself.Upon meeting Fox, Wesley is taken to a textile factory, which is a front for an underground, vigilante network known as The Fraternity. Leading this secret society is an elder named Sloan, who tells Wesley that his destiny is with The Fraternity and that his soon-to-be cohorts, including Fox, all share the aforementioned physiological traits compatible for the perfect assassin.Who is to be assassinated? Only the stitching in the woven cloth holds the key, and Sloan is the one who translates and interprets what is to be revealed and carried out. Supposedly, Sloan is the intellectual heir, a Grand Pooh Bah if you will, of the wisdom of the prophetic practices of The Fraternity that have been handed down for over a millennium.Wesley, through this group, learns more about the purpose of his existence and why his father left him. Or does he? Surprising twists and turns await Wesley, whose identity, upon a sudden moment's notice, has essentially undergone a metamorphosis from George Costanza to Jason Bourne, the latter of which has been searching for his true identity.In all, a great movie played out by the star-studded cast, including the superb James McAvoy, the alluring Angelina Jolie, and the indomitable Morgan Freeman.

$review_text.: The year is 1963...as the world is reeling from the assassination of President Kennedy, Egypt has missiles posed to annihilate Israel.  The only thing preventing this is the lack of guidance technology to properly target the missiles, which Egypt is on the verge of obtaining with assistance from a group of Germans, once officers within the SS during World War II, now members of a group called Odessa, a clandestine organization designed to assist ex-German military personal gain new identities and lives, thereby avoiding capture, after the end of the war.The Odessa File (1974) takes the popular Frederick Forsyth novel of the same name, which is supposedly based on actual facts and events, and presents it as a truly wonderful, tense thriller that I really enjoyed.  Directed by accomplished cinematographer and director Ronald Neame, the film stars Jon Voight as freelance German journalist Peter Miller and Maximilian Schell as an ex-German officer named Eduard Roschmann, a man responsible for horrible atrocities, earning him the nickname `The Butcher', during his tenure as head of a concentration camp which housed Jewish prisoners.  After the passing of an elderly Jewish survivor of a WWII concentration camp, Miller comes into possession of a diary kept by the man, one which detailed, in particular, the various crimes against humanity by Roschmann, and also seemed to indicate that the war criminal may still be alive.  As Miller begins delving into the story, uncovering tidbits of information, he meets resistance in the form of various individuals, many of which turn out to be members of the secret Odessa organization, and are now actively working against Miller for fears that he may uncover their secrets.As Miller gets closer to uncovering the truths, the resistance against him grows, and takes the form of actual attempts on his life.  Around this time he comes into contact with a Jewish group, working to locate the site within Germany that's developing the guidance system for the Egyptian rockets, and Miller agrees to work with them, changing his identity in order to become an ex-German officer and enable him access to the Odessa organization.  In exchange for this, Miller will supply the group with information, while he himself tries to get closer to Roschmann.  As Miller infiltrates the group, his cover is eventually blown, but not before he learns of the existence of the Odessa file, documents that detail many of the members within the group, including Roschmann.  The goal now is survival, and given the circumstances, his chances seem pretty slim.I have not actually read the book, but I really liked this film.  Jon Voight is wonderful and believable, German accent and all, as a reporter, seemingly driven by a determination to expose a subversive hideousness, once prominent in his country, that has now gone underground, and threatens yet again a great many peoples of the world.  Listed as a thriller/drama, The Odessa File certainly doesn't disappoint.  The plot, while having many twists and turns, keeps focused, and rarely falters in its' progression.  The development of the characters is carefully planned, but not so to bring attention to the fact, allowing for the viewer to become drawn into the film.  The exposition at the beginning was a little awkward to me, but I didn't see any other way around it, so I accepted it.  Schell provides an excellent performance as an ex-German officer hiding in broad daylight, one who will resort to any means necessary to protect his secrets, along with those of the Odessa group.  One point I enjoyed was near the end, as a particular revelation was made.  Prior to that point, I had started to question one of the main character's motivations, and, as if the film knew what I was thinking, it answered my question in a completely satisfying manner.  The film runs just over two hours, and the first half may seem slow, but I felt as if this was deliberate, allowing time for the story to develop.  During the second half the film picks up speed as the tension mounts, drawing on the momentum carefully constructed in the beginning, resulting in a wholly enjoyable conclusion.  Given the nature of realizing novels to film, I suspect a number of plot elements were left out, but what was left seemed to be missing very little, at least anything that left a glaring hole which would pull the viewer out of the movie with its' obviousness, which indicates a skillful adaptation of original source material, done with care to preserve the elements which made the book so very popular and well received.  All in all, this is a really thrilling outing, one that requires a little patience, but provides a rewarding experience overall.Presented on this release are really good looking prints, both in wide screen and full screen formats (it's double-sided).  The audio seems a bit soft, but there are English subtitles, so I missed nothing.  As far as special features, there are some well put together production notes in a four page booklet within the DVD case, an original theatrical trailer, talent biographies for actors Voight, Schell, and director Neame, and trailers for Anaconda (1997) and Oliver Stone's U-Turn (1997), neither film as good as this one, but both certainly benefiting from Voight's appearance...and that's another thing...remember when Jon Voight appeared in good films?  Along with this film, I also count Midnight Cowboy (1969), Catch-22 (1970), Deliverance (1972), and Runaway Train (1985) to be some real highlights of his career...and let's look at some of his more recent films...Most Wanted (1997), The Karate Dog (2004), and Baby Geniuses 2 (2004)...not exactly the caliber of films early in his career, but who knows what the future holds?Cookieman108

$REVIEW.: OK, first of all, you need to know that I'm a sucker for just about anything that has to do with the ocean, oceanography, and marine biology.  So, when I started watching this show I was more or less hooked because it's about the ocean and oceanographers.I remembered seeing the lead actor, Angus Macfayden, in the movieBraveheartwhere he plays Roger the Bruce.  I liked him in that, so I thought I'd give this a shot.  Frankly, I was impressed by the fact that he was cast in the role he played.  I know quite a few marine biologists and oceanographers, and he looks more or less like them.  They are not the stainless steel and sex-appeal types often cast in leads.  He has the facial hair characteristic of the discipline, he's a little overweight, and he wears casual attire worn by them.  I was not impressed by the slick character cast to play the director of the oceanographic institute.  Anyway, I pushed forward and watched the whole thing.There is actually pretty good suspense and drama that appears here and there, but I felt like the backgrounds of the characters were not fleshed out well enough.  All they give you is that something bad happened, and you never really know what the technology was that they were working on, and how it could be altered for sinister designs.There is the powerful, but desperate corporate mogul (Tom Skerritt) and his conniving 2nd in command, and the 2nd in command's strong-arm man.  This sounds pretty typical, and it was.  There are also a couple of FBI agents who seem to be able to act pretty independently, like they have no supervising officer, but that may happen sometimes.  Some of the characters were WAY too typecast - like the killers that show up later in the show.  Talk about people on steroids!There was relatively little in the way of special effects, but they did get the basic idea of water being sucked offshore as the wave builds.  I thought that was pretty cool.All in all, it grabbed and held my attention, largely for the reasons I listed above, but I was happy I saw it.  It was not a life-changing event, and it was just OK.  I don't think that I'll be recommending it to anyone.  So, 3 stars.  That's it.  I liked it, I didn't "really like it", and I certainly didn't "love it", so 3 stars.

$review_text.: ... except that it's not really a movie.  movies have dialogue and character interaction and plot.  this film does not.  most of the running time is unrelated scenes of harvey keitel doing drugs with random people and being an immoral scumbag in general.  i can accept evil, unlikeable characters as long as they are doing something interesting.  but the first half hour of this film is scenes that might as well have been from different movies.  nothing connects them except for the presence of keitel.  we don't know who any of the supporting characters are, since none of them are even given names that i remember.the plot, if it can be called that, revolves around keitel's reckless gambling, and the violent rape of a nun.  he is somehow given the case, although why remains a mystery.  he certainly doesn't spend any of the film doing actual police work.  he's supposed to be a cop, but don't cops have to do police work sometimes?  he spends most of the movie doing drugs and wandering aimlessly from scene to scene.and most of the scenes are unwatchable.  the scene where he pulls over the young women and basically coerces them into a sex act is pretty much the most reprehensible thing i've ever scene.  the agonizing rape of the nun, and keitel's insane rambling confession to jesus are also pretty much impossible to watch.the real problem is that we have no idea how he became such a godawful human being in the first place.  he has a wife and kids, but exactly how he manages that is also a mystery, since he again spends most of the movie drugged out of his mind, passed out in random locations.  that he actually has a family and a job was probably the most unbelievable part of the film.  there is simply no way keitel could behave the way he does without his family and fellow police officers catching on.  the film had no credibility whatsoever.and the end?  well, let's just say that it made no sense, and leave it at that.  it was probably the most pointless and idiotic ending in movie history.the only redeeming quality of the film is keitel's absolutely unflinching performance.  it's amazing really, but he wasted it on a horrible film.  if you want to see a good movie with keitel, watch reservior dogs.  if you want to see a good movie by abel ferrara, watch king of new york.

$review_text.: Having been released just 8 weeks apart in the early summer of 1998, "Deep Impact" and "Armageddon" are inexorably linked ("Deep Impact" was released first).  Since they are both cosmic-object-threatens-Earth stories that invoved huge ad-hoc NASA missions to bore holes and drop nukes, it just makes sense.  Oh, yea, and New York gets trashed in each movie, too.  However, the films are are essentially flip-sides of each other.This might sound sexist, but it is fairly easy to tell that this movie was directed by a female (Mimi Leder).  To quote a previous reviewer, "This is a great SF movie by a woman director who focuses on the emotional aspects rather than the hero dynamics."  While Jerry Bruckheimer certainly acheived the hero dynamic with his testosterone-laden "Aramgeddon", Mimi Leder's "Deep Impact" attempted to hit the emotional mark, but just about completely missed it.Although, refreshingly, one can watch this movie without totally suspending one's concept of reality, as is required with "Armageddon", there is still the feeling that something isn't quite right with this film.  The elements are certainly here, such as Morgan Freeman's unremarkable, but dignified protrayal of the President.  The biggest problem is that the movie tries to set up the emotional moments in the various storylines, but then never really delivers them.If "Armageddon" was an overdose of amphetamines, the "Deep Impact" was certainly a large quantity of Valium.  The epitome of this was Tea Leoni, whose playing of a news reporter was remarkably void of any real humanity whatsoever apart from a feeble attempt at the end.  As a matter of fact, she gave a complete sense of detachment, which I'm sure was the opposite of what was intended.None of the other principals did anything to overcome this, except for Robert Duval, who was the veteran astronaut proving that old dogs can indeed learn new tricks, but even so, it was too little, too late.  It is just about impossible to really connect with either the story or characters.  It's akin to the soft-spoken announcer of a chamber music radio station trying to describe a riot; it just doesn't work."Deep Impact" composer James Horner, who did a masterful job with the music of "Titanic", unfortunately misses the mark, too.  "Titanic" fans will find a lot of familiarity in the film score, as some of the themes bear a striking resemblance to James Cameron's epic.  The music here though, instead of reinforcing the emotions (as it did in "Titanic") seems to further add to the sense of detachment.  This is suprising, being a James Horner score, but it didn't fit in very well.Despite it's faults, and they're big ones, there is still a lot to like about "Deep Impact".In last half-hour of the film, things actually start getting a little interesting hour of calamity arrives.  There is action without overblown antics.  The special effects are all tastefully done and reasonably realistic, which is refreshing to the heavy-handed ones in "Armageddon".  The comet of "Deep Impact" looks like it should, just merrily Hale-Bopping along and minding it's own business (until Earth just wanders into its path).  This is opposed to the "Armageddon" astroid's actively stalking, menacing appearance.  I am admittedly no expert on tsunamis, but the one in this film seems to be the most realistic one I've seen.  The explosions are kept to a minimum, and makes it all the more believeable.Although nowhere near the magnitude of the whoppers in "Armageddon" there are a few technical errors worth noting:- The comet certainly looks a *lot* bigger than it's advertised size (7 miles) in the landing and drilling scenes.- Exactly how was the comet's initial path calculated based on a single picture?- Those familiar with the lay of the land in New York City probably realize that the only way the wave could hit where it did was for it to have originated in NEW JERSEY and not the actual ocean.- The part of the comet that impacted in the Atlantic did so while moving east at a high velocity.  How could that produce such a powerful westbound wave?

$REVIEW.: You can always expect certain things from a Terry Gilliam movie. When he has a budget as he did in this one, it will look beautiful, the story will be an odd one with some cool effects and sense of humor. These are all present in the Brothers Grimm, but the movie still doesn't completely work.The Grimm Brothers are con artists. They fleece money from villagers by setting up a myth about a witch or creature and then showing up to destroy said witch or monster. They are eventually captured by the French army and sent into the Thuringian forest to battle an actual ancient myth. The performances are good and it's a clever story but it just doesn't grab you. I was bored part way into it and never accummulated a great interest in how it would turn out.I think more humor might have helped. Also, the story didn't flow as well as it should have. Some scenes seemed just to be an excuse to show you some special effect they had thought up. The characters had little history and could have a used another dimension. This wasn't a bad movie, but something was missing.

$REVIEW.: I really wanted to give this movie a chance too. I can't believe I did. It is by far the worst Crow ever and quite simply, almost the worst movie I've seen. I powered through it hoping the end would vindicate it. No such luck. Furlong has no credibility as the Crow. He looks like a girl with the makeup and choker and he had zero confidence. Tara Reid is ridiculous as is most of the cast except for the girlfriend of the Crow. Add to it that I think none of the Native Americans were actually Native Americans. The plot sucked, the acting sucked and the story is a waste of time. Don't bother.To all those who have given this movie three stars and more, I'm pretty sure someone paid you to write an ok review. That's the only way this movie rates more than one star.

$REVIEW.: Gettysburg is a really good film if you're a civil war fan, or even if you're not willing to go that far and are only slightly interested you'll still probably get something out of it.  The acting is alright (if you can get past martin sheen as robert e. lee...that ain't quite right) the score is fantastic and the battle scenes are powerful and memorable.But this is a long movie.  A really really long one.  At 4 hours and 15 minutes it's one of the longest feature films ever released.  And even though I can sit through three hours of just about anything if it's interesting and fun, there's something about that fourth hour that gets to you.  So excessive length is the only real demerit here.But if the civil war interests you and you haven't checked this flick out yet, give it a go.  Wait for some rainy sunday afternoon and pop it in.  You won't be disappointed.

$review_text.: Having watched most of this series on my PBS station, and bought half the dvds here at Amazon, and the other half on vacation, I can tell you this was a welcome change to my PBS lineup one Saturday Night (they actually showed it at least 4 times already), and a welcome addition to my never ending library to start 2006.  It's done as a 2 part 45 minutes each story, with both young couples Alistair and Judith and Harry and Sandy returning to the Hardcastle home with the usually newlywed worries, the former worried that they can't have a baby, and the latter about to have one while Harry looks for a promotion.  With their usually humor, the old 50s vintage couple of Lionel and Jean set them both right.  The climax comes at the end of part 1 when a handsome young Kenyan comes calling to see "his father".  This gets resolved right away in part 2 as it turns out he's part of a large family that looked to Lionel as a father for putting up money for them to live while living there.  Now he's an intern at the local London hospital.  Eventually, Steven and Penny (Jean's first husband's sibling and in-law), Rocky (Lionel's father) and Mrs. Bale (Rocky's housekeeper) show up to had more fun to this warm hearted return to a series that ran a decade on BBC and PBS and continues to rerun in many cities here.  Definitely a must add to your box set (or individual installments) of the original series.

$review_text.: I heard of this program long before I saw it.  It was praised well above everything else--it was hailed a new landmark in nature documentaries.  Saddly, I need to say I disagree.  Why give it a 4 out of 5 then?  It's still amazing.  Still better than most anything coming out from PBC, BBC, Discovery, whatever.  But that doesn't mean it is up to the standards that Attenborough has set.  Though someone correct me if I'm wrong, but is this even by Attenborough or just narrated by him?The reason I ask is because in almost all cases, Attenborough's 'Life' series (as it's come to be known) shows some sort of internal organization that becomes essential in keeping the gigantic series from turning into a big chaotic jumble.  'Life on Earth' used geological and evolutionary time to seperate its various episodes while 'Trials of Life' focuses on how the universal trials that all life faces are met.  Elsewhere, Attenborough catagorizes his show in someway that you always have a sense of where you are within the epic work (I think only one of his programs is less than 6 hours, so 'epic' feels pretty appropriate.)This is precisely what 'The Blue Planet' is lacking and I'm surprised to see no other reviewers echoing this sentiment.  There is simply a LOT of repetition.  Poor sardines get killed over and over by hordes of dolphins, gulls, tuna, sharks and even whales that one begins to feel quite sorry for them.  It was quite awesome to see it the first time, but these attacks show up in 3 or 4 programs as I recall.  The lack of organization is even reflected in the absense of an episode number or previews for other episodes.  In short, instead of 'The Blue Planet' being one complete work, it is instead 8 self contained episodes that do not feel compelled to contain exclusive material, themes, etc.Where 'the blue planet' stands out is (as stated elsewhere) the deep sea episode.  This one is truly a keeper and will amaze everyone who sees it.  The other episodes are also quite good, and cinematically they are staggering.  What isn't here is a story--and let's be honest, that's what Attenborough does best, capturing our imagination with grand themes unfolding, giving us at last a greater world view than we had before.  The Blue Planet however has no story, no greater message, no beginning nor culmination.  It is 8 seperate installments about life in the sea...and I'm afraid, nothing more.

$REVIEW.: This is one of those kids movies that grown-ups can watch, and possibly even enjoy

It features a Cinderlla-like story, but with giants and Ogres and pop-culture humor


It actually achieves a good balance of being funny without becoming too silly (although the dancing Ogres come close)


I particularly liked the Elf who wants to become a lawyer - what a great character twist.

$review_text.: I think 21st century parents of teens should buy this movie, the story of a "nice" girl and the hunky teenage boy she fell for.  It's one of the first to use an adorable teenage girl (Sandra Dee) who every girl wanted to be in a role where she defied her well-meaning but naive parents and went "all the way."  After this movie came out, we teen girls talked of nothing else at slumber parties and school lunches.  Unlike real life, the pregnant girl ended up with the hunky guy, and attitudes began to change among teenage girls.  I know because I was there.  Sadly, not all girls ended up with the guy like Sandra Dee's character, but the number of "shotgun weddings" increased in our small town after this movie and a few others of the same ilk ("Splender in the Grass," "Payton Place," and "Return to Payton Place") came out.  Most sociolgists cite the introduction of the pill as changing sexual mores, but it was the movies.  By the time the pill came out, attitudes had already changed. I think it could be used today to start a conversation with pre-teens and teenagers about morality.

 I have a MaCormack Power amp and two NAD power amps along with Legacy and JMlabs Speakers
 This system Rocks along with this great concert


 Yes, I actually like to hear the crowd in all five speakers


 It's the only concert dvd that sounds like they are here not just I am there
 I will agree with the other reviewers that the Camera shots are too Quick and short to focus on anything or anyone
 A lot of concerts are like this these days

 Be glad that the older Rush concerts are not jumping scene to scene every 2 seconds

 Rushes Counterparts Dvd(1994  Michigan) is the best I've seen for good camera editing
 Heck, there are times when the camera is on Geddy for 10-15 seconds at a time

 Now back to the Rio concert.


The Dragons stomping and Neil's Drum solo really shook my House and gave my subwoofer a real work out
 Some of those effects go below 20 herts and all you can do is feel them and not hear them


 Totally Awsome..
Let's face it
 this is a power rock band and its going to be loud in every way whether it's Alexes guitar, Neils percussion or the CROWD
 Still a damn good show

 If you don't like to hear 50,000 stoned fans then I recommend Nora Jones in New Orleans for well recorded, small auditorium crowd with every note played or sung with the utmost clarity.

$review_text.: Ok, first off let me mention that I grew up with this stuff in the 80's, and the Care Bears have always annoyed me, as there is only room in my heart for one Bear and that's the Poo, none the less I found this first movie actually enjoyable when I watched it as it played with the whole theme of a good natured character is faced and tempted with Evil like he has never encountered before and which of course tests him to great ends!It is stories like these, like Star Wars (classic), like the old Disney films, etc. Stories in which the comedy is not dependant upon a knowldege of the topical pop culture and "issues" of the main stream media of the time and country in which it was made. Stories in which the characters did not have to reflect Consumer Culture, Vanity, the aspiration to be a self proclaimed Diva/Princess/Brat. Stories that were very basic, very close to the human experience, to the heart, and to what makes a human......humn, to be quite plain and simple. Which is kind of shocking considering that this film was designed to make kids mindlessly salibate for the toys, which makes one wonder,"is it really the toys that are so appealing, the pieces of gender altering plastic, or is it the conditioning of being raised in a co-depentant, shop for happiness, the mall is the meca, consumer based families and societies?" You just got to ask yourself.Which brings me to my second point. What is with all the bashing of this film like it is special in that it is a marketting campain for a toy? What is new? Movies have been used as adverts for products for a very very very long time, worse yet, media in general has been used not only for selling the slave labour toys and prodcuts made from "developing nations" for our children and for ourselves, but also the fact that media, musick, movies, etc. Are used to con the masses into idealogies which lead to mass murder, opression, indentured servitude, etc. Yet no one seems to be awake to this idea even though the concept is as old as the celluloid it is made upon if not older...Besides it's like singling out that one pop singer for lip syncing on SNL and the Orange Bowl or what ever. Why single out one egg, when the whole carton is bad?!!??!?!Again, regardless of being a marketting tool, it delivers a wholesome message, so for once in my life I will say commerciallism in this instance is far from mindless, and far from harmful nationalistic or relgious propagana, just pure, simpl fun! Highly suggested!

$review_text.: I thought this series was a bit rough about the edges in its first series.  It was a bit too hung up on being set in the sixties and in the main character's loss of his wife to a supposed murder.  all of this has been put on the back burner by series two and three so that i am avidly anticipating series four.martin shaw, a wonderful actor seen on other uk tv series, stars as chief George Gently with his cohort Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). These two in combo is what makes this series.  Often the young whippersnapper is just cute in these series but here there is a really delightful screen pairing. Bacchus makes mistakes left and right, both personally and professionally, but his chief guides him through these upheavals. this even includes the younger man's misadventures with the opposite sex despite his being married, something american network tv would never touch.by this time the sixties are a backdrop to this series but are less obvious in this rural backwater.  we don't get hit over the head with the era every second as we did in series one. one thing i find as an improvement is that the characters are not constantly on their cell phones.  however, they are handicapped by not having computers with crime databases and dna as forensic evidence.if you haven't discovered this series yet, i highly recommend it.  i just viewed seasons one-three on netflix instant viewing.

$REVIEW.: Well...maybe three and a half stars.  Although I don't know that much about the CG, I'm sure this movie has been "Hollywoodized" like most other movies about the military.  Regardless, it was a good story with mostly believable characters.  Costner's Senior Chief Randall is believable except when he's jumping out of a helicopter.  Of all the rescue swimmers I've come across, not one of them appeared to be over 30.  It is definitely a game for the young.  There aren't that many CG Senior Chiefs, and someone like Randall might be in charge of a training unit or even a small CG station, but probably not jumping out of a helo on a dark and stormy night.  That aside, the part that REALLY bugged me was the clich&eacute;d inter-service bar fight.  I spent nearly 24 years in the Navy, and I never saw ANY overt hostility towards ANY member of ANY other service.  Also, Navy people, officer or enlisted, don't typically go to civilian bars in uniform.  A Navy Captain as fat, old, and decrepit looking as the one in the bar scene is the very rare exception.  I'm sure that 30 or 40 years ago you could find a Navy Chief fighting in a bar, but today, it would be very unusual.  Today, a Navy Chief behaving like the knuckle-draggers depicted in the movie probably wouldn't be a Chief for very long.  That fat old Captain would also likely find himself in a fix for allowing enlisted sailors to behave like that.  However, once the story moves past that BS, there's some interesting material on how rescue swimmers are trained and the harsh conditions in which they sometimes operate.  The ending was a surprise as well...I'm glad the alternate ending (included in the DVD bonus features) wasn't used.

$review_text.: I own a few of Burton's films, and it's obvious he has no clear vision regarding the scope of his projects. Edward Scissor Hands, Sleepy Hollow, his version of Planet Of The Apes, The Corpse Bride, Beetle Juice are all basically small concepts forcibly stretched out into attempts at full movie scripts. So far the only film a value in a critical sense by him is Sweeney Todd... and that subject is basically hack material by now. I feel this is like most Burton movies, a little bit of his quirky style and not much else... no stand out acting, boring redundant Elfman soundtrack boys choir and all... "ooooo~ewwwww~oooooo~ahhhhhhh~haaaaaa~haaaaaa~oooooo"I doubt Burton has the capacity to conceive of anything of true substance having made countless films all revolving around cheap fluff material.

$review_text.: With the backdrop of the wide open plains and the constant dust winds, Carnivale is a group of wondering 'Freaks' trying to make a living during the depression. They band together as a family each with their own talents and hidden secrets, and who live by their own code. These secrets are slowly revealed as the plot unfolds. The first few episodes are slow and you are left wondering what it is all about, but as you push on you begin to see where it is heading. There is constant reference to biblical narrative and much symbolism but the prophecy is clear, at some point there will be a confrontation.The two main characters Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin, struggle with the revelation of their true calling, one with the ability to help the other to harm, Ben and brother Justin are trying to fight against their destiny, until the last episode when they finally begin to give in.This is an atypical story of good versus evil, well written and very well acted, one not to be missed!Looking forward to season 2.

$review_text.: I love horror films and have seen many, new and old. However, none have affected me so much as The Ring. Not the Omen, not Excorsist, not The Shining. Those films have nothing on the creepiness that this film possesses. Now, I have not seen the original, but I hear from different people that they find that one better, and some, find the remake better. I guess it doesn't really matter. They are probably both pretty intense. Naomi Watts does a fantastic job as a petrified woman trying to stop something horrible from happening. Of course, she doesn't realise what that entails. The look of the film is one of foreboding. At every turn, in every scene. It must be the hue, its this murky bluish grey, and it surrounds the entire film. You never know what to expect. The beginning of the film is awesome, and the end is the most disturbing, creepiest thing I've ever seen. I cannot look at a well the same way anymore. The infamous tape that is in the movie, while not really scary, it is pretty disturbing. I think the soundtrack has something to do with that as well. Whoever scored the film did a great job in setting the atmosphere.  I still would not really categorize this as a horror film. Its more of a suspense thriller. When I think of horror, I think of a slasher film like Nightmare on Elm St or the Jason films. The Ring is on a completely different level. Though it freaked me out, I still loved it, and have actually seen it more than once.

$REVIEW.: Hercule Poirot, the diminutive Belgian detective of Agatha Christie's imagining, is brilliantly brought to life by British actor David Suchet. Suchet, who was chosen for the role by the executors of Christie's estate, turns in a characterization that is now universally considered the non plus ultra of  all Poirots of the silver screen, large or small.Since 1989, Suchet has worked steadily to bring all the Poirot stories (33 novels, one play and 50 + short stories) to life, and by 2013 will have accomplished this impressive task.The earlier seasons are framed in the Art Deco 1930s, a period which is meticulously recreated onscreen. The series abounds with droll humor, generated largely by Poirot's insufferable self-esteem garnished with his freely flowing malapropisms. His foils include Captain Hastings, the Dr. John Watson of Poirot's universe, Chief Inspector Japp, the disheveled LeStrade, and Miss Lemon, Poirot's Obsessive-Compulsive secretary. Hastings tends to go off on tangents (frequently about motorcars), Japp is always three steps behind Poirot, and Miss Lemon keeps the office running smoothly, giving Poirot's "little grey cells" ample opportunity to unravel the Gordian Knots of cases that cross his desk.The show has a slower and more methodical pace than most American television, and the mysteries are more softboiled, with an absence of the lurid violence we've come to expect on TV. Anyone turning to POIROT for an adrenaline rush will be put to sleep. But if you enjoy low-key period mystery stories, this show simply cannot be surpassed!

$REVIEW.: This is one of those weepy boy movies, up there with "Saving Private Ryan" (though a little easier on the stomach) and "The Right Stuff".  I took my 4-year old to see it, and he loved it.  This movie has something for everyone - heroism, camaraderie, adventure, romance, history.  The romance portion was handled well, without excess.  No cheesy love ballads, no love confessions.  It's a good thing that the Boy and the Girl spoke different languages.  If say said "I love you", that would have been too much.  It's a good thing that the movie remained a War Movie, not a Love Story.Here are a few historical inaccuracies.  The tri-planes were not common in 1916.  They were really hard to manipulate.  But I understand that the director put them in the film for extra visual stimulation, because they do look menacing.  Also, I find it hard to believe that the American pilots gained such control over their planes in such a short period of time.  The film makes it look like they spent 2 weeks training and emerged master pilots.

$review_text.: Despite that Wyler's version was shot in color and in widescreen and that some 30 years later special effects were much more advanced, Fred Niblo's black-and-white version works better for me. Why? In my mind, this is largely due to Francis X. Bushman's performance. Especially the maniacal charisma he displays in the chariot race scene (for the bulk of that sequence it is as if you see nothing but the whites of his eyes). If you're not yet into silent films or Bushman, this is a great place to start.

$REVIEW.: I read the book first and loved it.  The characters are well defined and the environmental descriptions allowed me to travel right along with them.  The film follows the book very well, with few exceptions.  It made the book even more enticing.  The lead actress is amazing, even though she speaks infrequently, her facial/eye expressions say it all.  The version I saw has English subtitles; but then there are moments of such intensity, I forgot to read them.  This is a Swedish film as was the author.  We are so fortunate that he managed to complete 3 books in this series before he died and we are unfortunately deprived of future works due to his untimely death. R.I.P.If you are strictly a Disney fan, you will not enjoy either the book or film; but if you are into everything else (intrigue, conspiracy, murder, mysteries, even love/sex), you'll love it too!Just an update:  I have seen the film again, with English dubbed, have to say I enjoyed it even more this way.  Also it was worth seeing again.

Kind of predictable - a miracle transformation, vast odds, within inches of failure, stunning success, acceptance back home once he's proven himself. Plus a similar tale of redemption for his business partner. (If you think this is a spoiler, you need to see more movies.)OK. you've seen it before, but your kid hasn't. Fun characracters, quality animation, excitement without being too scary (but you know your little one best), and pretty tolerable for the grownup buying the tickets.

$review_text.: Mollie, a New York City accountant, becomes pregnant, thanks to her boyfriend, Albert

They aren't married, so Mollie claims it was artificial insemination

One day, Mollie finds Albert cheating on her so it was over between them

But then, her water broke and she had to be rushed to the hospital

Who should happen along but cab driver James Ubriacco
The midtown traffic was a disaster but James drove as fast as possible
Mollie's baby was soon born

He was named Mikey

He began to comment in his mind about everything he saw

 James dropped in on Mollie one afternoon to return her purse which she had left in the cab


James even took Mikey out while Mollie took a nap


They went to go visit James' grandfather in a rest home and to the air field because aside from being a cab driver, James was a pilot


Mollie expressed her distaste of James unexpectedly taking Mikey out by hitting him; Mollie was looking for a suitable father figure for Mikey and James looked like a sure winner, but she won't even consider James

She dates several other guys while James babysits Mikey
He teaches him to dance and we all know John "Saturday Night Fever" Travolta is a heck of a dancer
But as luck would have it, Mollie and James begin to get close

Albert comes by one day and meets James, who interrogates Albert on what Mikey's favorite cereal was, how many diapers he goes through a day, favorite rock star, standard stuff a father should know


Albert also proved dull when Mollie and Mikey go to visit him


So that was it for him

 James takes Mollie flying one afternoon


They go to visit James' grandfather and the events of the day are as follows: Mikey experiences what driving a car is like and Mollie and James finally fall in love; It's a pretty good movie


John Travolta and Kirstie Alley are good
Olympia Dukakis, Abe Vigoda and George Segal are here too! That is Bruce Willis doing the voice of Mikey! The original cast would return to do Look Who's Talking Too! Then they did Look Who's Talking Now where Mikey has grown up to the stage where he can talk on his own but it's the dogs that talk in that one


So in conclusion, I recommend all three of these films

You're looking for a good comedy or like any of the above actors, this one's for you!

$REVIEW.: In December 1996,after almost four years on the small screen,MTV's Beavis and Butthead hit the big screen. Most of the supporting characters from the MTV animated series appear in the film. Their neighbor Tom Anderson and his wife are traveling in their RV. B&B are in beautiful Las Vegas,Nevada and in one scene,are evicted from a nightclub because of their being underage(it appears they are still ninth grade students at Highland High School). B&B are hired by an attractive hooker,voiced by Demi Moore,to look for her missing husband. When B&B fly to Las Vegas,they meet an elderly woman,also a passenger on the plane. The elderly woman is voiced by Estelle Getty,late of TV's The Golden Girls. Beavis after consuming corn nuts,turns into his alter ego,The Great Cornholio. TGC walks about the aircraft with the back collar of his T-shirt over his head and his hands in the air saying silly phrases like,"I AM CORNHOLIO!,WHERE WE COME FROM WE HAVE NO BUNGHOLE! and I NEED TP(toilet paper) FOR MY BUNGHOLE!" TGC does not stop once he starts. The soundtrack features great music from AC/DC,Red Hot Chili Peppers,No Doubt,Ozzy Osbourne and LL Cool J. During the opening credits,TWO COOL GUYS is performed by Isaac Hayes with a 1970's sound. He had a hit in 1971,the theme from SHAFT. During the end credits,Engelbert Humperdinck performs LESBIAN SEAGULL. That song is easy listening,his all-time genre. This film was based on the MTV series created by Mike Judge who later created the B&B spinoff Daria and the Fox series "King Of The Hill".

$REVIEW.: STIGMATA is a polished and actually an expertly fashioned tale of prurient voyeurism via the exorcism film genre

That is until it reaches its midpoint and then it descends woefully into mediocrity and a ridiculously constructed tale of Vatican cover-ups, which is really what the film is all about in the first place

The allure of sex and a sadomasochistic slant heighten the viewer's interest certainly to a voyeuristic level of curiosity but the film never delivers or explores what it seems to imply
Gabriel Byrne looks as confused as the rest of us


Padre Pio, who is mentioned in the film, was a real priest who had bore the stigmata for over fifty years

This is well documented but I truly believe it had little to do with Vatican politics
His stigmata was a sign of devotion and sacrifice


 The stigma this film will carry is one of artistic failure because visually it is well made but the foundation of a solid script crumbles the efforts of those artists responsible for what grasped us and titillated us initially and actually had us sit and watch this tale unfold only to be disheartened and somewhat annoyed by its inferior conclusion.

$REVIEW.: Rene Russo as Catherine Banning is great, her facial and body expressions are quite versatile as she proceeds to find and entrap the art thief, taking risks with her own heart and soul.  Communication between Pierce Brosnan as Thomas Crown and Russo is near-telepathic.Unfortunately the bad guy gets a pass, leaving me wanting.  Enjoy the scenes at an island villa and in the NYC mansion.  If you are older, the characters look and act your age, which is often rare for a romance.Catherine's superego is played by Denis Leary as police detective Michael--the most real person in the film--but he too gives the art thief a pass.  If you love great art, you may cry when a "maybe-forged" Renoir is destroyed.  Faye Dunaway plays 35 y.o. Crown's shrink -- Catherine from the original film -- somehow looking younger than Russo.  Anna, played by a Spanish supermodel, is such great eye-candy that the SO stated he could not see why Crown would pass her up for Catherine.  Guys can be such bores.

He is very believable and he is a great actor (Jose Ferrer and Charlton Heston too).Unfortunatley, that is the only positive comment that I have to make.  The direction and screenplay are terrible.  What is so hard about consulting and following the story that the Word of God has to say?  The true message is not told.  Why not?I have not seen every Jesus movie, but I have seen quite a few.  I highly recommend the "Gospel of John".  I have watched it twice recently(the 3-hour version) and it is awesome.  It was made in the same year(2004) as Mel Gibson's "Passion".  If you are looking for a film that is true to scripture, watch "The Gospel of John".

The whole place literally shook when she played Hollaback Girl (the highlight of the performance) and the energy that she and her dancers gave was unreal.  She had some really great things to say about New York and I remember her saying something along the lines of "Since you keep buying so many of my records I have to keep making them."I was also amazed at how fast between numbers she was able to change costumes and the show kept screaming for more.  The only downside to the performance was I was hoping she would have thrown in one or two of her No Doubt numbers (Don't Speak especially) but she only performed her numbers from the Love Angel Baby CD.

Her acting is atrocious.  And fighting enemies while listening to her ipod is just idiotic.  One needs the use of all of their senses, particularly hearing when engaging in combat.  Especially against multiple enemies.  And is it just me, or did Ryan Reynolds completely suck in this?  His jokes are not funny in the least bit.  This was my first exposure to Reynolds and I have to say, he never quite recovered as an actor for this writer.Goyer decided to, for whatever reason, to make Blade a supporting character in his own movie.  He is given nothing to do but react to the Nightstalkers poorly written dialogue.  And the antagonist Drake, is nothing more than a Eurotrash joke.  At the end of the film he tells Blade that he respects him for fighting with honor.  Yet earlier in the film he hides behind Reynolds and then runs away from Blade like a wimp.  Wow what honor he showed.  This movie sucks beyond reason and Goyer should not be allowed to direct anything ever again.

$review_text.: Oh no, not another version of Sherlock Holmes. Hasn't everybody done Holmes? Starting in 1905 when the first film about Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary consulting detective was created it seems that the character has been a staple for every studio and many lead actors since. Most of us are familiar with the Basil Rathbone series which began with "The Hound of the Baskervilles" in 1939, the Christopher Plummer Holmes of "Murder By Decree", Nicole Williamson's Holmes from "Seven Percent Solution" and on and on. And, of course, we mustn't forget the recent Robert Downey Jr. Holmes franchise which will shortly release its second feature in the series.It seems that everyone has tried to breath a new life, a new twist into the culturally pervasive story of the oddball but fascinating mega-minded character. What is there left to do? We've seen Holmes take on Jack the Ripper ("Murder By Decree"), interact with Sigmund Freud ("Seven Percent Solution") and even his first encounter with his estimable companion, Dr. John Watson during their early school days ("Young Sherlock Holmes").Amazingly, the BBC has managed to elevate the character to even new heights with its new series simply titled "Sherlock". A glance at the combined average rating of this product should show how well they have succeeded.Set in contemporary London this Holmes operates in a world of electronic media, cell phones, texting and the internet, all technologies which should deminish the uniqueness of the character, at least to some extent. After all, nowadays anyone with a laptop can do instant research on practically anything, virtually turning themselves into a source of endless information, like Holmes himself. Yet even folding these technologies into the universe in which this Holmes operates, the series manages to present Holmes as leaving a world of instant information in the dust.The recent theatrical feature by Guy Ritchie, starring Robert Downey Jr., chose to be more true to the original Conan Doyle character as it was first concieved. It is set in Victorian London of the 1880's, when the stories were first written, and heavily infused with Ritchie's own wry, biting sense of ironic humor. Ritchie's Holmes is very much the action-adventure hero, surrounded by amazing special effects, exciting dangers and intriguing mysteries. He romps around town making understated wisecracks and relying as much on martial arts as his phenomenal mind.But BBC is television. That means much smaller production budgets, tighter time frames and a strong focus on characters. How could it hope to compete?Two words: Stephen Moffett, the series creator.For those who know him, he is the current producer, hear writer and driving force behind the immensely popular "Doctor Who" series, having taken over that seemingly eternal BBC sci-fi franchise this season from original producter Russell T. Davies, and he seems to be capable of rising to any challenge. On the "Doctor Who" series he took over in the wake of what many supposed to be the ultimate imagining of the Doctor as played by David Tennant. When it was announced that the seemingly perfect Doctor (Tennant, who literally owned the character for five seasons) was going to leave and be replaced by relatively unknown Matt Smith, there was much concern the quality, the imagination, the wit, charm and brilliance of the show would quickly sag back toward something much more mundane. But it didn't. Knowing he could never copy or even emmulate Tennant's Doctor, he chose to shift the whole thrust of the character sideways and it is working perfectly. He has done the same thing with Holmes.Coming virtually on the heels of the Robert Downey theatrical release it might at first glance look like an exploitation copycat knock off, so common in media entertainment. In fact it might very will be one of the best versions of the character ever created.The acting is of stellar quality from the entire cast, the dialogue beautifully subtle yet sharp and witty beyond belief. But it is the intricate, almost intimate structuring of the plot, repleat with layer on top of layer of twists, turns, loop-de-loops and head-turning shocks that elevates this series to new heights.Many mystery fans savor the opportunity of trying to figure out "whodoneit", trying to "get it" even before the characters reach the inevitable revelation that explains everything. Sometimes they are diappointed when elements and "clues" are kept hidden until the very last moment and then suddenly revealed making the solution blindingly obvious. (Agatha Christie is routinely guilty of this). Other times the plots are so convoluted and presented so subtly that they produce a kind of numbness, turning them into almost a chore to track, absorb and process (John Le Carre's George Smiley is often guilty of this).Moffett's Holmes has found the perfect balance. Even those times when the audience manages to run a bit ahead of Holmes in understanding how various clues fit together, there is always more to follow and the next step toward the solution remains excitingly shrouded and tantalizing. And those ultimate revelations, when they at last arrive, don't plop down out of left field or simply confirm some speculation we had figured out many scenes ago. This Holmes keeps you rivetted every step of the way and the world in which he operates (contemporary London) is seamlessly logical and fascinating.I have thus far watched only the first of the two disks and am eager to absorb the rest. Each of the four episodes of the initial series is a full feature film, running 90 minutes, giving ample time and space for the story to be fully developed at a comfortable pace, and allowing enough time for us to get a good view of the quirkiness and undeniable charm of the characters.Any mystery fan will love this series. So will those who savor great writing, engaging plots and solid acting. It is definitely one to own.One final thing that was a huge breath of fresh air. The "officials" and police are not idiots, bent on preserving their own egos, careers or authority by constantly obstructing Holmes at every turn. They don't necessarily like Holmes, and might resent needing his help to do their jobs, but they are at least smart enough and "real" enough to know they must work with him to get the job done. For this alone this version of Holmes ranks at the top of heap of the legendary consulting detective's collected adventures.

$review_text.: I'm not a big fan of action movies, or Tom Cruise, and the only other Michael Mann movie I've seen is Last of the Mohicans. I still should have known better than to wait three years to check out Collateral after the glowing reviews and Jamie Foxx's Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.Tom Cruise shows that he really does have the acting chops to pull off a variety of roles as his portrayal of Vincent is quite a departure from the typical Cruise hero. He's got a different voice, walk, and attitude. And with the white hair and beard he's captivating to watch as he unstoppably takes on the sociopathic hired [...] role.Jamie Foxx is equally engaging as Max, a big-dreaming cab driver that has never has the follow through to make any of his dreams happen. Collateral follows a night in Max's cab and the character arc that Max follows because of the events that transpire.Jada Pinkett Smith has a smaller role, but still puts in some solid acting as a prosecuting attorney who rides in Max's cab.The action and dialogue throughout Collateral are brilliantly played out and hard to turn away from. You won't want to miss a minute of the movie for fear of missing a cool special effect, a great acing moment, or just a quick plot point. The helicopter panning shots over the city of LA are pretty awesome too.The second disc is full of special features, including a short about Tom Cruise dressing up as a FedEx worker in order to work on not being recognizable for the role of Vincent. There's also a making of featurette and a clip of rehearsals between Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx with director Michael Mann. It's all worth checking out.

$REVIEW.: ..

This will do.I take it that most of you reading this now are already acquainted with the movie and, most likely, you like it enough
So no point really in reviewing the film itself, and better give you a little information on the DVD edition that I'd rather have liked to know to better decide on buying this or not.This is part of one of those "made-to-order" program from the studios to put out movies whose potential sales don't warrant a standard, commercial release, so this is quite no-frills, although the inclusion of a commentary track and an interview with director Peter Bogdanovich is much appreciated added value
But the presentation is quite poor for usual DVD standards, from the subpar DVD menus that are ugly and amateurish to the barely remastered movie itself, with plenty of scratches and other print damage, this could well be a bootleg DVD

A pretty good bootleg, but a bootleg nonetheless.The movie is presented in what it looks like 1.66:1 ratio, sadly non anamorphic.And the audio is just proficient enough, with no dynamic range to speak of, but no hiss or hollow echoes either
It just does the job

And there are no subtitles available, in any language.All in all, I don't regret having purchased this (it was under $8.00) since there is no other way available for this under-rated little gem, but I lament that it did not get a bigger budget and the more careful remastering it deserves.

 I had not seen the series since it originally aired in the early 1980's
 This is a cool show with educational value

 It is pre-"Back to the Future" by a few years
 Good stuff!  Sadly the series did not last long, thus they were able to put all of the episodes in this 1 set for the show's 25th anniversary (1982 - 2007)
 I highly recommend this DVD set
 Unfortunately it is not in a book or at my local library

$review_text.: Of the four main Alien movies, this is the least good. (There's a reason why idiot channel AMC fell in love with this particular chapter.) But it is a whole lot better than either of the Alien v Predator movies, both of which were truly atrocious. I know, I feel like I'm saying Star Wars Episode I is better than the 2008 Clone Wars movie, but I digress...Alien: Resurrection is either worth a rental or just worth putting up with in your Alien Anthology set -- watch it once, shrug it off, move on, but do watch it. It's flawed, to be sure, but it's not That Bad. If nothing else, watch it as a double feature with one of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's earlier films (especially City of Lost Children or Delicatessen) to compare a pure Jeunet film with one made in Hollywood conditions.A4 has a fairly unique (for the film series) visual style, with washed out and harsh greens, browns, golds."Firefly" fans and Whedonistas will probably see in the held back and not-very-inspiring crew of the Betty a prototype for the "Firefly" crew.The tone is confused, wavering between grotesque surrealism, violent horror, overzealous/awkwardly hyper action movie and comic book caper, and flat-falling attempts at dark humor. Oh, well.The film-makers decided for some reason that quadrupling the amount of slime and KY jelly covering the Aliens, and showing more acid and guts and gore of all kinds was the way to go. In their obsession with cheap horror movie tricks and cliches, they lost sight of character, even in the creatures. The Queen is back, only to look ridiculous in mammalian pregnancy, and the Newborn (the Jar Jar of the Alien series?) had potential, but mostly doesn't work, ultimately and ignominiously getting sucked out of the airlock as if the film-makers just gave up on him when they excised writer Joss Whedon's earlier ending.Winona Ryder makes a valiant -but losing- struggle of giving Call character. She does have moments, but not many. The new Ripley -- now a part-Alien hybrid-- is a very fascinating character that is ultimately under-explored here. The rest of the human characters are just very broad stereotypes that no amount of stunt-casting can save. And the language....sometimes I don't mind cursing, which can have a dramatic function, but here it's over-the-top, clumsy, and immature.The action varies wildly from some okay setpieces to some ridiculously unbelievable sequences. The practical creature effects are okay, but the CGI versions of the Aliens --beautiful as they look-- are painfully obvious to today's eyes. John Frizzell's (yeah, I know, Who?!!!) score is just lazy and uninspired horror-action music. (Even so, his idiot underwater suspense cue got used in two or three dozen trailers of the 1998-2004 period, for typically unfathomable Hollywood reasons.)Also comes with intriguing open ending that could have led to a better second half to this story, exploring Ripley 8 and Call and Earth a bit more.OK, it's not great, but if you haven't seen it yet (esp. if you've suffered either or both [!] AvP movies), give this one a viewing, imagine how cool it could have been had they tried harder, then move on.

$review_text.: I'll say what I said for the Season 3 set: I love 'Alias' and have religiously watched every episode from day one. I have actively tried to sell my friends on it for years. And when they finally start watching (beacuse they liked 'Lost' and it's made by the same guy) it's Season 4. Oy.Yes, Season 3 was a slight drop in quality from the first two glorious seasons. But Season 4 practically fell off a cliff, especially in the first half.In order to retain the audience from J.J. Abrams' new baby, 'Lost,' 'Alias' was retooled to reintroduce the characters, drop the backstory, and make each episode self-contained. In other words, the arcs being followed by fans of the first three seasons were dumped to keep everyone from changing the channel when Locke and company signed off each week. For good measure, beautiful leading ladies Jennifer Garner and Mia Maestro were teamed in skimpy outfits so that promos sprinkled throughout 'Lost' and Monday Night Football would reel in Joe Sixpack. I was surprised they didn't have them kiss during sweeps.At any rate, the pandering gave way to the preposterous when the murderous Arvin Sloane was placed in charge of the black ops division of CIA, with two spies (Syd and Dixon) reporting directly to him whose fiance, best friend, and spouse he'd had killed. This led to Sydney making several "I don't trust you, you vile snake" speeches that she'd already made a dozen times over the years. In my opinion, this setup absolutely gutted her character and made everything she'd learned and done over the past three years pointless. If the real Sydney and Dixon were told Sloane was their new boss, they both would have whipped out their sidearms, emptied their clips in Sloane, reloaded, made sure his head was hamburger, high-fived each other as everyone else applauded, and bought drinks for the whole gang.Sidebar: The producers' infatuation with Ron Rifkin clouded their judgment and it mutilated the show. If they wanted to keep Sloane around for the series finale, all they had to do was keep him in prison then on the lam until time for the endgame. Using Sloane as the big bad for all five seasons was a creative crutch that kept the series from exploring new territory. Season 4 was supposedly an attempt to "recapture" the feel of Season 1. They failed by forcing Sloane into the mix.At any rate, the preposterous ceded to the ridiculous when YET ANOTHER Derevko sister (of yet another ethnicity) showed up who was - surprise - a spy. If they had pulled in one more Derevko spy sister or if Jack Bristow started discovering spy brothers, I would have officially handed in my Alias Geek Badge.The previous season's cliffhanger (which seemed to have something to do with Syd's childhood) was tossed out and turned into a cover story for Lena Olin's refusal to return to the show.And the low point? The vampires almost win this prize but I have to go with the deadly toy helicopters.The events leading up to Clifford the Big Red Ball threatening the world actually started to smack of the good old days. There were some interesting character-driven episodes that delved into the pasts of Jack, Arvin, and Nadia. And when Lena Olin finally showed up (however flimsy the logic), it became great. Too bad it was practically over!Speaking of being over: I must give proper credit for the cliffhanger. It was one of the best in TV history - not so much for what it revealed (which gutted Vaughn's character) but how it did it. Bam!

$review_text.: Seldom, if ever have I been so enamored with a movie.  Emir Kusturica weaves a poignant, comic, vicious, madcap, sprawling, and physics defying cinematic experience deftly intertwined with the history of Yugoslavia and its successor states.Most criticism of the film that I have read revolves around the interpretation historical events.  I am not Serbian or Bosnian but I do have knowledge concerning the break-up of the Yugoslavia, WWII, and the Serbian atrocities inflicted on various other ethnic groups in the region.  Emir Kusturica was so badgered by attacks concerning his glossing over of the real issues of the succession (ethnic cleansing etc..) he was forced into voluntary film retirement (thankfully that did not last long) because of the hostile reaction he received at home in Bosnia even though he won the prestigious Palm de'Or at Cannes in 1995.  I do not have a clear rebuttal, but I can say that this exclusion should not condemn him.  The monumental task of embodying the history of a country, the feelings of a people, into an extended family over 60 years cannot include everything.  A WWII movie about the invasion of Normandy most likely will not address the holocaust, neither will a movie about German U-boat captains address the Invasion of Russia in any depth.  The material which he covers for a Hollywood director would be material for 10s of movies.  His concentration on a single family (and the history that eddies around them) excludes discussion of atrocities for to quote Emir "they were not all bad."In his interview at the Cannes Emir made the point that the film was to show that the people in the troubles of Yugoslavia were "not all bad."  This statement is depressing in the context of the movie itself for it is hard for the audience to sympathize with anyone.  Those that are truly innocent are either mentally retarded or hidden Underground and brainwashed with Tito propaganda.  That is the chilling part of the film, and this I feel is the crux of his message.  Many people in Yugoslavia were misguided, but in the context of Tito's regime, WWII these actions are definitely not to be forgiven but perhaps, understood in context to a greater degree.The acting is impeccable.  Miki Manojlovic is my personal favorite portraying the alcoholic womanizing and eventually fiercely loyal husband.  The chemistry between him and his best friend (Lazar Ristovski) is exceptional as is the love triangle with Mirjana Jokovic (an amazing actress).  Slavko Stimac plays the mentally slow Ivan and his journey through the tunnels in search of his chimpanzee friend is harrowing and frightening.My favorite element of Emir Kusturica's films is his use of magical realism.  This element is normally used by South American writers, and Italo Calvino and Borges in Europe but rarely is it used in Cinema.  If used poorly it can seem corny and contrived.  Emir is the master of using the technique, for example, the glorious Underground wedding scene with the bride connected to the wheeled wooden arm.  Only in the beginning is this moving contraption seen, in all other shots the bride is actually flying around the room, over the tables. The effect is stunning.  Many stories thrive off of unexplained, unscientific, elements that the characters themselves are oblivious too.  The grenade exploding in the suitcase, the detaching island, the underwater scenes, etc...The movie is LONG.  The scenes are madcap, the music exceptional and infectious and inches further and further into your skull as you watch edging you on to some conclusion, either you love or despise the movie.  The movie is also heart wrenching while being astoundingly funny, the dichotomy is paramount to his message.  It explores the joys of family, of love, and the terror of events and feelings (war, lust) that seem out of and individual's control.  A cinematic masterpiece.

$REVIEW.: With a few missteps
 The first half takes you on a random, visually diverse adventure through a university, Vietnam, a hospital, then the university again


 Then it sort of settles into a slightly predictable groove of making it's arguments with exclamation points like a tv movie of the week would

 I cannot help but feel the romance, friendship, and organization for the disabled were brought to life in a somewhat stale and cliche fashion


 Everything just sort of falls into place in a straight line instead of the unique zig zags of the first half.

$REVIEW.: There have been many movies that I have seen throughout my life, but no movie has had such an affect on me like The Passion Of The Christ


I was born and raised as a Catholic and over the years, my faith in God and Christ has always been strong

This past weekend, my mother, father, and I took ourselves to the theater to see this film
After the movie had ended, I felt my faith grow so much stronger than ever

The movie is very, very graphic and gory, but that only goes to show you that that Jesus actually suffered that badly

Seeing how this innocent man suffered brought immediate tears to my eyes
All I wanted was to meet the real Jesus and just give a huge hug.I cannot say for sure if I liked this film or not, but I gave it five stars because of it's outstanding direction that was done by the famous Mel Gibson

James Caviezel gave an unbelievably incredible performance as Christ himself


If you are a Catholic who has not yet seen this film, I do recommend that you go out to see this film

If you are not a Catholic, I highly recommend that you go out to see this film
But I must warn you all, Catholic or not, if you do decide to see the film, I can assure you that you will be in tears throughout the entire movie
When I saw this film, I had a million tears streaming down my face


I even cried myself to sleep
Go out and see this film and you be the judge.

Charlie's ignorance of 'human bedhaviors' causes eruptions for him emotionally, and crew members begin to disappear.It takes a rather long time before Kirk and Spock to figure this out; which was exasperating to me, since we are talking Starfleet Academy Officers here.

$review_text.: Morgan Freeman co-starring in a tear-jerker with a fellow crusty old actor and a younger starlet...Hmm, haven't we been here before? Yet the spare plot, rural setting and the actors' interaction make AN UNFINISHED LIFE ultimately satisfying. Add in Becca Gardner and Camryn Manheim and you've got the perfect movie for a cup of hot chocolate on a rainy afternoon.Einar (Redford, in one of his best performances) is a bitter, struggling, semi-retired rancher who shuttles between caring for his injured friend Mitch (Freeman) and occaisional trips into the nearby town. I like the rural dynamics at work here - the stereotype of the independant, "needing nobody" farmer shattered (and defined) by his relationship with such characters as the law-bending Sheriff and the diner owner (Manheim). He needs this tiny hamlet as much as they need him.Of course, this theme of interdependance carries through with Mitch's concern for the grizzly bear that mauled him, and  the arrival of Einar's daughter-in-law and Griff, her daughter by Einar's dead son. Themes of blame and forgiveness are worked out as Einar forges a relationship with the granddaughter he never knew he had. As he visits his son's grave on the property we see his inner struggles and ultimately a sort of redemption.If you liked the director's past films CHOCOLAT and THE SHIPPING NEWS, then you'll appreciate this latest effort....

$review_text.: The last season ENDED in a brutal cliffhanger with an attempt on the President or Zoe. The last scenes were the staff and bystanders diving for cover as gunmen shot from windows in a nearby building. This season opens trying to untangle the confusion of that night and opens a rich, second season of the best drama on television. We are also treated to some great pre-first season moments, when the staff was managing Bartlet's presidential campaign. From my count there were 17 Emmy nominations this season - for writing, acting, and more - I've noted the episodes that were winners. My only complaint is that they're making us wait so long for these sets, when people overseas have had them already for almost a year - come on, it's OUR idealist leadership.

$review_text.: "Alone in the Dark" is without doubt one of the worst movies of 2005. It is not offensive bad, no racial remarks, no sexist points of view, just pure and simple Hollywood studio system trash. I heard a lot of people say this is a bad movie. The critics bashed it left and right, but, I'm stubborn. I never believe public opinion. I alway think people over do things. They make movies out to be worst than they actually are. Well, for once I agree with the mass majority, "Alone in the Dark" is a diaster. But you may ask why? I shall explain.There is a term used by screenwriters known as "beat". You may not be familiar with the term, but, trust me you know the device. A beat is that twsit that happens in a movie. It's that big action sequence or the moment when we find out the character's mother is really her sister, or it's that moment when we find out Bruce Willis is really dead. Are you starting to catch on? Screenwriters keep these scenes in so the audience won't get bored. Hollywood seems to believe that an MTV generation has a short attention span, now, maybe they (Or I should say "we", I'm 22) do, but the movie is just a big pile of action sequences and no story. Like clockwork every 15 minutes we get a big action scene, the movie even starts off with one. That was my first indication I was in trouble. When a movie starts off with a big action sequence it is a set-up of what to expect; all action , no plot or character development. But it's not just the action scene that bothered me. Going into a movie like this you have to expect that. But, what I didn't expect was the lousy editing, acting, dialogue and directing. The movie tries to be stylish for no reason at all. There is a scene where the camera gets inside opf a gun so we can see a bullet fly out and hit its target. Why was this done? I don't know, maybe director Uwe Boll has watched too many John Woo films. The difference is with Woo the device is used to place importance on the fight scene and create suspense, in "Alone in the Dark" it tries to make the movie look "important". It's an attempt by the director to say "Hey look! I'm an artist!". The movie's editing is so frantic that we can hardly keep an image in our head. Everything is going go so fast, except the time oddly enough, because it felt like this movie was 4 hours!And what about this cast. Granted I'm not a big fan of Christian Slater or Tara Reid or even Stephen Dorff, but, you can't be serious with this fellas. Did any of you really think this was going to turn out to be a good movie. Please tell me you were paid a large sum of money for this. And what about Tara Reid? She has been going through a slump it seems. For a while she was making headline and just as fast she has become a b-list celebrity. Reid plays Aline Cedrae an intelligent scientist. How do I know she's intelligent? Why because she wears glasses of course! That is about the only contribution she makes to this movie. The glasses and the fact that she's the only one with long hair seperate her from everyone else. She has no dialogue, and what ever she does have is no more to 1 line or 2 and what lines! All the dialogue comes off as phony. It's what I call people acting normal trying to act normal. You can't act naturally. Either you are or you aren't. The dialogue and acting reminds us of those 1940, 1950 sci-fi movies. Think along the lines of Ed Wood without the big budget. But, I shouldn't just pick on Reid. It's not only her it's everyone! They are all terrible in this this. We don't sense who any of these people are. Nothing is developed. This is a low-point for everyone involved.How a movie like this got made is beyond me. And people wonder why I stay away from these action pack big budget movies. From now on all I have to say it "Did you see "Alone in the Dark"?" Please I'm warning you stay away from this movie. There are so many better films out there that you could watch. If you like sci-fi movies, hey, that's fine watch "Alien", which is kind of what the "creatures" look like. Just please don't waste your time on this.Bottom-line: Easily one of the worst movies of 2005. Terrible acting, dialogue, editing and directing. Hopefully this will be the worst movie of the year and all my other movie going experiences will be pleasureable. Here's hoping.

$REVIEW.: There is something extremely entertaining about Tim Burton's `Big Fish'; a mature fairy tale about a young man trying to understand the man his father truly is.  Burton has a way of taking what could easily become syrupy or saccharine and turning it into something sweet yet honest; never overplaying his hand so-to-speak.  `Big Fish' follows that formula, delivering to the audience an overload of mystical creatures and faraway lands and beautiful imagery wrapped up in a tender story about a father and son yet it never once comes across immature or childish.This is a plus and a minus in this case, but I'll get to that in a minute.The film revolves around Will and Ed Bloom.  Will has never really understood his father; in fact he appears to have a deep seeded contempt for him and the fact that he feels he was never allowed to get to know him.  This is because of all the `tall tales' Ed proceeded to tell Will his whole life.  When Will hears that his father is on his deathbed he travels home, hoping to finally hear some truth regarding his fathers life.What he gets is...Like I mentioned, `Big Fish' is visually beautiful to witness.  The sets and the costumes and the vivid use of colors are classic Burton all the way and manage to draw the audience into the fanciful world.  The stories told are all cohesive and fun to entertain.  This has a lot to do (or should I say everything to do) with the script, adapted from Daniel Wallace's novel.  Watching the stories unfold we can see clearly their truths amidst all the colorful exaggerations and this adds to the beauty of the story `outside' the stories that is unfolding between Ed and his son.The performances by the entire cast are wonderful as well, especially that of the two Ed's, Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor.  Albert Finney is truly one of our finest actors that ever has graced the big screen (his relentless Oscar losses are crimes against humanity) and he brings so much of his natural charm to this performance you can't help but adore it.  Ewan McGregor likewise captures the fire still burning in Finney's eyes and exemplifies it as the younger, fantasy version of Ed Bloom.  I adore McGregor as an actor and feel he has a wealth of talent under his belt.  In `Big Fish' he is as magnetic as usual and delivers a top notch performance.  Jessica Lange is marvelous and touching as Sandra, Ed's wife, and Billy Crudup manages to make Will believable and relatable.  Recent Oscar Winner Marion Cotillard does a fine job with what little she is given and makes a lasting impression; albeit because she is stunning and possesses such unforgettable beauty.The immense cast of `fantasy' characters are all brought to life vividly as well thanks to strong performances by everyone from Helena Bonham Carter to Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi.  Alison Lohman does a fine job as the younger Sandra as well.In the end `Big Fish' is highly entertaining.  It is a fantasy tale that the whole family can enjoy and it manages to teach a beautiful lesson about family relationships.  This is also where that whole `anti-saccharine' element can be a minus.  What is great about `Big Fish' is that it feels honest and `adult' throughout, yet what I miss is that uncontrollable emotional connection that is supposed to overwhelm the viewer as the film draws to a climax.  If Burton had only kicked up the `syrup' for the ending, then I could feel this film was perfect.  There is a balance needed when doing anything, and while one does not want a film that is one big mushy mess we should never underestimate the value of some well positioned waterworks.

$REVIEW.: The first hour of the movie is impressive. The cinematography, the editing (twice with the same scene told from two different perspectives, one observed from Briony, the young sister and one showing what actually happened), the score (with typewriter providing the background sound) and the young sister's steadfast gaze and focused attitude all make an excellent presentation.Then the second hour moved to the war in 1940, both in Europe and in London. A drastic change in the mood. Visually stunning and touching. Especially when Vanessa Redgrave as the old Briony disclosed everything that happened after her lie in 1935 - the truth as well as what she had hoped for.I would say this is a good and thought provoking movie. But I can't help feeling what's holding it back from being a better one.(a)It's very Joe Wright - it bears too close a resemblance to Pride and Prejudice in the first hour, in portraying the life of the Tallis family in the English countryside. In so doing, the movie lacks its signature tone and is somehow masked by the director's previous work.(b)I wish I had not seen Pride and Prejudice and Miss Potter (with Keira Knightley, James Mcavoy and Brenda Blethyn already in the cast in addition to the same visually stunning portrayal of the English countryside). Atonement could then have made a refreshing and fluid story telling movie that stands out on its own.(c)While Saoirse Ronan (young Briony) and James Mcavoy (as Robbie) are superb, Keira Knightly (as Cecilia) is not in the same league. She has the beauty but somehow her determined and firm look make her inner feelings unable to surface completely, short of what Saoirse Ronan and James Mcavoy have achieved. She could have delivered more subtlety and depth to her character. Maybe some part of the Elizabeth (Pride and Prejudice) still lingers in her or maybe the director finds that already adequate? James Mcavoy, on the other hand, has pulled off a wonderful performance. Juno Temple (as Lola, Briony's cousin) is also impressive. She got to portray the young and the grown up Lola. It's unfortunate that Saiorse cannot do likewise and continue her captivating screen presence.That being said, Atonement is still worth watching. I am also more sympathetic to what Briony (the young sister) has done. Should Robbie and Cecilia have been more discreet in their younger days, Briony would not have to make such a difficult decision. So atonement, in some sense, needs not rest on Briony's shoulders alone.

$REVIEW.: How can you not like a movie as wildly immaginative as Six-String Samurai?  To put it simply; this movie rocks!  A post-apocolyptic adventure that features echoes of everything from Kurosawa, Woo, and the Mad Max series to  Shane and The Wizard of Oz, Six-String Samurai takes all of these  elements(and several others) and melds them into a highly entertaining and  original concoction.  Jeffery Falcon turns in a fantastic performance as  Buddy, a samurai guitarist who is going to Lost Vegas to become the next  King.  His report with the orphaned child works quite well and is, in fact,  quite touching.  Death is hillariously portrayed as a heavy metal Slash  clone, complete with wigged-out flunkies who sound like they've been  sucking on a helium tank.  The cast of loonies that Buddy and the kid  encounter sends up any number of post-nuke pictures.  Psychotic bowlers,  gumball hurling barbarians and a Mexican midget are just a few members of  the film's rouge's gallery.  Contributing an excellent assortment of songs  is the Russian group The Red Elvises.  It works perfectly, warranting a few  extra dollars to purchase the soundtrack album.  This film is a blast from  start to finish.  See it.  You won't be disappointed!

$review_text.: Tevye (played brilliantly by Topol) is a poor Russian trying to keep house for his wife and five daughters. Life plods on in daily grind until the day he tries to arrange a marriage for his oldest daughter only to find she has promised to marry a local tailor. This goes against everything he believes in and his struggle to come to terms with the changes around him is both hilarious and poignant to watch. I'd defy any parent not to get emotional when watching 'Sunrise Sunset' being sung at the wedding.When daughter number two decides to follow the poor student she loves to his exile in Siberia, Tevye is still upset but more philosophical than previously. However, daughter number three, the apple of his eye, has chosen to marry a Gentile, to turn her back on the Jewish faith. His torment is palpable as he tries to reconcile his beliefs with his love for his daughter.Set during the time of the Russian Pogroms, where Jews were being driven from their homes and into exile, this is at times a very sad film. However, for the greater part of the film, Tevye's exuberance is infectious and the music is wonderful, such songs as 'If I were a Rich Man', 'Matchmaker, Matchmaker', 'Wonder of Wonders', have you tapping your feet.One of the best musicals ever made. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: "Broadway Damage" is the most adorably classic, campy, sassy romantic comedy I've seen in years!Lead role, Robert (Aaron Williams), is absolutely cute as a button and his witty Broadway-style songwriting will make you blush and smile and get up and sing! Fellow lead, Michael Shawn Lucas, plays the role of Marc, an aspiring (not so successfully) Broadway star. The two are precious in a 'perfect ten' sort of way, and are accompanied by their quirky "fag hag," hilarious, gay-ball-busting best friend Cynthia. I have to admit I'm a softie for this actress, Mara Hobel, who was also a star in "Mommie Dearest" ("No more wire hangers!"). Brilliant. Just campy brilliance.The production is brilliant, the characters and acting impeccable, and most of all, the climate is over-the-top, Broadway-inspired, campy bliss with the rooting of a classic romantic comedy. Ingenious, this one, and I guarentee it will leave you smiling and wanting more, especially if you're at all exhausted with the consistent formula of gay cinema. Pick this one up; it's charming and zany, and you won't be disappointed!

$review_text.: "The Dying Gaul" is the name of an ancient Roman marble statue, which is believed to be a copy of a lost ancient Greek statue.  It is a realistic depiction of a dying Celt, naked except for neck torc, a wound in his side indicative of the deathblow that will claim his life.  "The Dying Gaul" is also the name of not only this 2005 film from writer-director Craig Lucas (writer of "Prelude to a Kiss" and "Reckless"), but of the script that Robert Sandrich (Peter Sarsgaard) is shopping around Hollywood.  The script is the story of two gay men, one of whom is dying, and Robert sees the famous statue as a metaphor.However, Producer Jeffrey Tishop (Campbell Scott) loves the story, but sees no profit in making a movie about two gay guys in love.  After all, the two guys that "Philadelphia" was about were not the lovers and "Brokeback Mountain" is not in release yet.  The deal Jeffrey offers is to pay Robert $1 million to revise the script into a heterosexual love story, where "Maurice" becomes "Maggie," who is dying of AIDS.  This cuts close to the heart with Robert because "Maurice" was based on Malcolm, his lover, who is now dead.  Consequently, agreeing to this deal is an act of betrayal on several levels for Robert.  But then we get to the first two twists in this one.I checked out this movie because it seemed every week its trailer was on a DVD I was watching.  So I thought this was a movie about a writer selling his soul to get a movie made.  The movie even begins with a quotation from Herman Melville's "Moby Dick," which warns, "Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appall."  But it turns out "The Dying Gaul" is about another deal, because Jeffrey turns out to want another part of Robert's anatomy.  That would be the first twist and we now realize that the producer's attempts to seduce the writer at that initial meeting literally was an attempt at seduction.  The second is when Jeffrey's wife, Elaine (Patricia Clarkson), discovers the two men are having an affair, and what she decides to do about it.This film was originally a play, which may well explain why it is that so many key scenes take place in an Internet chat room accompanied (in the film) by voiceovers.  But Lucas the director does not serve his cast as well as he does as a writer, and there are several scenes where the artistic elements overwhelm what is happening.  Still, the three main actors turn in fine performances and the ending is appropriately twisted given the situation that has been contrived.  People do not have to be monsters to do monstrous things, and the character arcs of Robert, Stephen and Elaine would suggest they are not monsters.  But in the jungle that is Hollywood evil must be repaid in kind.

$REVIEW.: Dragon Eyes(released April/12)stars Cung Le as Hong(Pandorum),Jean Claude Van Damme as Tiano,and Peter Weller as Mr.V.The film was directed by John Hyams,and considering his extremely disappointing work in Universal Soldier:Regeneration,I was more than a little concerned about this effort.However I`m pleased to say that this film meets and exceeds my expectations.Hyams uses a light but stylized touch throughout the film,including an off coloured,sepia like toned lighting to emphasize the mood and look.The plot involves Van Damme who is a lifer in jail for the accidental murder of his own son.He lived in an area called St Judes,which is run and controlled by Weller,a drug lord.He in turn has an Hispanic group running his east side and a black gang running the south side.To keep them both in check he,from time to time,will bring in the local Russian gang called the Devil Dogs.Weller also controls the cops,so he can have anyone locked down that he wants on a whim.In the middle of St Judes is an apartment complex owned and run by a grandfather and his daughter.One day Le comes a calling,looking for a room to rent.Le has met Van Damme in prison,as he was sent up for the murder of a young lady he did not commit.In Le,Van Damme sees the Dragon Eyes,one good,one bad and both in conflict.Van Damme fine tunes Le`s innate abilities in martial arts and asks him,upon his release,to go back to his old neighbourhood of St Judes,and clean it up.Something Van Damme was originally trying to do when he was jailed.Le does indeed go back and at first locks heads with the local gangs.Little by little he works his way into their good graces,and ultimately,Weller`s.Le`s plan is to play all sides against each other and it indeed works for the short term.In the long term however,Weller finally gets wise to his plans until the final showdown comes,in which the wrongs are finally righted.It was an immense pleasure to see Peter Weller back on the screen and he plays his character to menacing perfection.Van Damme also does a good job with his limited role,virtually playing himself,as he teaches Le the finer points of martial arts.Le is also a credible performer here,and his strengths lay in the fight scenes.Watch for Van Dammes son as one of the two corrupt cops.The story as I described it,is told in the film,in reverse order.So what we see as we are watching,is the past in flashbacks,eventually catching up to the present rolling along before us.The fight scenes were all nicely choreographed and through some judicious editing and camera tricks are given some really snazzy dynamic.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in a 2:35:1 widescreen aspect ratio.The only extra is a 10 minute featurette on the making of the film.One minor point I would like to make before this review irises out,is directed towards Sony Pictures.Sony has NOT been,I feel,promoting their Van Damme films to their full potential.I had no idea this film had even been released until I happened upon its mention on Mr Van Dammes Facebook page,then I went a-looking.Van Damme has been turning out some of the best films of his career in the last few years and Sony should be capitalizing on it big time.Maybe his fans should be writing to Sony and creating some of that VanDammage I hear so much about.....at least,in my opinion.All in all a recommended film of drugs and corruption and ultimate redemption in the barrio.Get it today.

$REVIEW.: I must be blind.  I just don't see what everyone is talking about.  CASINO is not (and let me emphasize "not") Scorsese's masterpiece.  I don't mean to say that it is a bad picture by any standards, but there is much more depth in Scorsese's catalog than comes to life in this film.CASINO provides an interesting (and long, coming it at three hours) history of Las Vegas in the 1970s.  As in GOODFELLAS, it provides us with a window to the underworld of the Mafia and allows us all to satisfy our desires to explore that world and view it from the comfortable distance of our own homes.  The story, while based on a true account, is not an unfamiliar one to filmgoer's: the tale of two men that get catapulted into the riches and glamour of money, drugs & sex, only to be chewed up, spit out, and left for dead by the business that once supported them.  In the process, they destroy all of the relationships that are near and dear to them and wind up where the story begins.It may seem that I am giving too much of CASINO's architecture away.  But, Scorses wisely employs the audience in this classic storyteller's technique, informing us from the very beginning about where the story will end up (as witnessed by the car bombing of De Niro's car in the opening sequence of the film).  Moreover, and this I was less thrilled with, De Niro provides a layer of dialogue that is peppered throughout the film.  Unfortunately, I did not feel that the dialogue was effective.  Rather, it served to prevent us (in some ways) from getting wrapped up in the storyline and gave the first thirty minutes of the film (where the dialogue is most obtrusive) a bit of an "amateur" feel.  After all, how tragic can the story be with De Niro providing his own reflective commentary.All of this being said, I did enjoy watching CASINO.  The performances by Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro (in that order) are definitely worth witnessing.  Each of them brings this story alive, despite its slow pacing.  Moreover, the story is a fascinating one, particularly if you enjoy movies about the Mafia.  However, my recommendation would be to watch GOODFELLAS first, as I believe it is a superior film.

Basically, a group of people are on the road and come in contact with a dog that infects them with some kind of disease or something, and everything just goes downhill from there.  I'm all for low-budget movies, but they have to be watchable, and "The Craving" is unwatchable.  Horrible script, zero atmosphere, terrible acting and just a zero for production values plague this comical so-called horror movie called "The Craving".  Avoid this movie at all costs...it sucks.

$REVIEW.: When the dvd of this movie ended, I looked over at my house guests and we all made the same gesture.  You know, where you hold your hand out and kind of move it like a teeter-totter. In other words, &quot;so-so&quot;.So where did it go wrong?  Well, I never was blown away by the book series.  It's dang good, don't get me wrong.  I have nothing but high respect for my fellow woman's libber, J.K. Rowling.  She is one of my heroes, even if she is a single mother.  But I know I'll never be as rich as her, no matter how many fantastic books I've written.  And those who know me, know I'm responsible for quite a few.The kids in this movie do a wonderful job bringing these characters to life.  But they're all too old for the parts, which is not their fault, rather the fault of some bonehead Hollyweird producer.  The special effects are first rate, too, and a feast for the eyes.  But I guess there just seems to be too much polish on this, whereas something like The Dark Crystal or Neverending Story Trilogy has a bit of you-know-what (HINT: it's yellow!) and vinegar.But hey, it's entertainment!  But I think they should stop the series, it's getting old.

$review_text.: The Cold War has thawed, and for CIA agents seeking to make an easy mint, the real money is in multinational corporations. CIA officer Claire Stenwick and Ray Koval are both racing to secure the formula for a product that will bring untold wealth to the company that lands the patent first as the stakes begin to rise, and their passions start to flare. Meanwhile, their mutual employers, industry giant Howerd Tully and trailblazing CEO Dick Garsil  start resorting to some seriously underhanded tactics in hope of gaining an advantage over the competition. Loners by definition of their own careers, Claire and Ray engage in a series of schemes and double-crosses while contending with the fact that their mutual attraction could ultimately jeopardize their entire missions. As with any spy movie, a certain amount of complexity in the script is to be expected. However this spy movie adds on plot twists, flash backs, back stabbing and double agents with so much frequency that it left me scratching my head by its end. As an on screen team Julia Roberts and Clive Owen work well together but even their performances were drowned out by the sheer complexity of the script. There are also welcome surprises from the supporting cast, each of whom seemed to have their fair share of witty dialogue. Ultimately the movie is less about a romance between rival spies, and is more about keeping you wondering just how the plot can twist next. "Duplicity" is a fun little spy movie, with some fine performances by Roberts and Owen and plenty of well written dialogue, but it is brought down by the overly complex plot. Enjoyable yet confounding.

$review_text.: I don't know about you but when I think of Pixar's "classics" rarely is Cars the first to come to mind.  The Toy Story(s) perhaps, Monsters Inc. maybe, even Finding Nemo for those so inclined and yet it took a under-whelming sequel followed by a revisit to the DVD I thought I knew well to realize that the first Cars is the epitome of all that Pixar has come to mean to modern animation.In the event that you've been living in a cave these past six years, Cars tells of a racecar sidetracked by fate on his way to The Big Race in California.  Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a brash NASCAR rookie who unwittingly gets lost and ends up in Radiator Springs, an almost-ghost town and former hot spot along historic Route 66, now ignored by tourists and travelers alike, thanks to the superhighway that bypasses the town.In the process of arriving, McQueen inadvertently tears up the asphalt of Main Street.  He gets arrested and is sentenced, against will and ego, to repave the damaged street.While paying his debt to society, McQueen encounters a 1951 Hudson Hornet, a rusty but lovable tow truck, a hippy 1960 VW bus, a classy but confident Porsche and a herd of tractors prone to tipping over and fluctuating exhaust fumes out of fright.The racing action certainly gets its due to be sure and kids have proven that a ragtag group of vehicles with eyes behind their windshields works just fine as toys, school folders, and backpacks.  But it is John Lasseter's underlying message that couldn't be clearer here: Pay attention to what matters: family, friends, true love, and it doesn't hurt to appreciate cars either.NASCAR-fans had much to celebrate, as did car-racing aficionados of all disciplines for that matter but it's the nostalgia of society's collective switch in thinking (from the scenery of iconic Route 66 being traded for the efficiency of the superhighway) that I found most prolific this time around.Even though 2006 might as well be eons ago in the ever-advancing world of computer animating technology, the visuals in Cars still manage to impress (especially in high-definition); a fact perhaps further enhanced by the abundance of heart within the prose.In all, and contrary to the trend that Pixar just continues to outdo itself in each subsequent effort, it is almost ironic that having watched the lackluster sequel in the theater led me back to the original and of course to rediscovering the charms that separate the good films from the great ones.

$REVIEW.: Recently there have been many, MANY, comedies where a bumbling naive idiot man-child gets into whacky scenarios and everyone ends up loving the loser for it, and Seth Rogen is fighting Will Ferral for who's the king of these dumb comedies. Observe and Report takes this similar concept and makes the end result of a man-child 'saving the day' into far more consequential and disturbing tone, which was a very welcome breath of fresh air for me. I think the reason Observe and Report has such low ratings is because it looks like another dumb upbeat comedy where the main character is just misunderstood when instead it took those ideas into much darker territory. Another thing that threw audiences off was the coincedential release of Paul Blart: Mall Cop which was a PG family comedy; so I think general audiences walked into this expecting Paul Blart with more fart jokes and swear words, hooooo boy were they wrong.So Observe and Report follows a mentally deranged mall cop Ronnie Barnheart, who takes his job far too seriously. The whole movie is basically a running gag of how delusional and psychotic Ronnie is as he tries to step up his game and join the New Mexico police force, and it worked for me. His character goes through some hardships and reality hits him hard at some parts, however it doesn't seem like he really learned anything new at the end, he's still the same deranged psychopath we're introduced to, and I liked that darker ending instead of him smiling with a family or something. As I mentioned above Observe and Report takes the whole man-child comedy genre and flips it on it's head, and that's the main reason I liked it so much, hopefully more dark comedies screw around with that tired formula.The weird thing about Observe and Report though is it seems to be on the fence about how it's played out, there's a predictable love story tacked on which seemed unnecessary and they needed that part soley for marketing purposes, a confrontation at the end where Ronnie assaults police officers that seemed to have no consequences for him, which was very strange considering there's consequences for the rest of his actions. Ronnie's 'crew' were also criminally underdeveloped, I know they're basically just his yes-men but we saw no insight into why they're following this lunatic's orders, Dennis was still pretty funny and had some more character to him but the two Asian twins literally do nothing but say 'yes' and wave to Ronnie.Overall Observe and Report isn't something most movie-going audiences will be interested, the laughs are more character and situation driven than actual jokes, and if soemone asked me "well what was a funny part" I wouldn't really know what to say because there aren't really any one-liners, it's all situational. Seth Rogen's acting as a psychopath isn't a great performance but I do appreciate that he's trying something new that isn't cheesy like Will Ferral's 'dramedies'. Fans of Eastbound and Down however will no doubt enjoy this movie, as it retains Jody Hill's style of comedy. Observe and Report feels like an uncertain but confident first step in a new type of comedy I'm hoping to see more of.P.S. the soundtrack is great

$REVIEW.: To sum the content in as few words as possible I would say: This documentary chronicles the complex synergy between man and beast

Not only is there some amazing footage, but BBC has done a spectacular job of making this a cinematic experience worthy of anyone's plasma TV
They even go so far as to strap a camera around an eagles neck while it stops a fox in its tracks! Have you ever wondered what a rocketship might look like to a caveman? We get as close as possible to viewing that experience when a plane flys by an uncontacted tribe deep in the Brazilian jungle

Yes, as many have mentioned before me there is lots of animal hunting which may be hard to watch
Monkeys shot with blowguns, a sperm whale speared by primitive weaponry..

etc


All this can emotionally drain people who are only used to ordering their meat from a counter, but what is most difficult to understand is the spiritual purity of man living off his environment and land without commercializing, profiting and interfering with its normal functions
These principles, I feel, are the documentaries greatest addition.

$REVIEW.: In a franchise, when there is a change of director or lead actor, there usually is a division of opinion.  I've noticed some think the Batman movies were better with Tim Burton directing and Michael Keaton playing Bruce Wayne/Batman.  While I preferred Keaton to Val Kilmer, this movie was 1) close enough to the original to fit in the series, and 2) was more likeable to me with Schumacher's approach.One thing that interested me in this movie were the villains.  Two Face never made it to the TV series I grew up with, but he was my favorite comic book villain.  The Riddler did not have much time in the comics that I saw, but I loved Frank Gorshin's Riddler from the TV series.Tommy Lee Jones' Two Face took me by surprise.  My impression of the comic character was more of a somber, sinister, intellectual man who was disfigured (and the animated Batman of the early '90's fit that image).  Jones portrayal was as over the top as Jack Nicholson's Joker.  I wasn't expecting it, but I liked it.As far as the Riddler:  my first impressions of Jim Carrey were negative (not based on seeing "In Living Color" or any of his previous movies, which I never watched), and thus I was disappointed to see he got the role.  Watching the movie, though, made me a fan of Carrey's.  Yes, I still like Gorshin's better, but this is close.There was only one thing I did not like about Kilmer's performance as Bruce Wayne, and that was his hair color (it did not matter after he put Batman's cowl on).  Kidman was great as the love interest.  Chris O'Donnell did an excellent job as Robin.  Drew Barrymore did okay in her small role.  Hinkle and Gough returned for round three, and fared as well as they did previously.As far as comparing the story with the comic book/TV series:  The series did not deal with the origins of Batman and Robin.  In the movie, Dick Grayson's family died as heroes, trying to save the lives of the circus audience from Two Face's bomb.  In the comics, I don't recall the same heroism in the deaths of the Graysons.The first two movies clearly avoided any allusion to the TV series.  Not so with this one . . . there is a hilarious scene that makes fun of the TV Robin.This was my favorite of the three, and I would recommend it.  It has the action of the second movie, but it does not have the same gloominess of Burton's two movies.

Although his life was interesting we wanted to see more politics involved as we know little about this dark period of the empire. We get to see little from the vandals and their king geiseric as we get to see little of the politic scemes in ravenna cause by 386 the emperor gratian was assasinated and we hear nothing of the usurper maximus who wanted to replace little vallentinian II on the throne of rome as we hear nothing about the great theodosius emperor of the east.Anyways this series resembles jesus of nazareth and it's a great addition in out roman dvd collection.Hopw we get more films with more politivs about the 5th-6th century roman empire.

$review_text.: Get A Life was literally so far ahead of it's time it only lasted 3 seasons, and part of me is AMAZED that it lasted that long.  Vol 1 only encompasses 4 of the 36 original Get A Life episodes, and though the 4 it does have are damned funny, they're not worth $10 a peice to own.It seems like everyone I know remembers the misadventures of the 30+ year old Paperboy with the title track of "Stand" by REM.  And almost all of them kind of wonder "what the hell happened to that show?" OR they wonder "what the hell was that show all about?".Basically, the show was the father figure to such weird, off based shows such as Malcolm In The Middle or Arrested Development, because it uses a very dark, twisted "what the hell?" kind of humor that is only believeable in television, but all together hilarious.  If you think Arrested Development was "ahead of it's time" (critics claimed this regularly) then that would be Get A Life would be the equivilent to a Caveman holding a quarter pounder, a flashlight, and a glock with a laser sight.This show was great and needs to be re-issued on DVD (preferrably in 12 episode, FULL SEASON, DVD's)

$REVIEW.: One of the best musicals of all time. A bit soap-operatic to be sure. A beautiful score and a brightly photographed Technicolor movie. The plot is quite dated, as these days, nobody cares about Blacks &#34;passing&#34; as Whites, as the South no longer exists in this regard, and multi-national heritage is encouraged and embraced. Fine performances by all with Howard Keel the big standout. &#34;Old Man River&#34; reverently sung as the classic song that it is, with no apologies for it's stereotypical &#34;Dialect&#34;  and intentional word mispronunciation. Rarely shown on TV (except on TCM)  because of it's obviously uncomfortable racial overtones, but well worth your time.

$review_text.: A sure way to ruin an otherwise intriguing thriller is to loosely tie in patches of action as though someone sat and conceived all these sequences and then threw in a story to somehow tie them in.&quot;Ricochet&quot; had Dezel W, pretty much the sole reason I picked up this movie. And it started with a bang, literally, followed by some superb action right down to the middle of the film.Yet, midway through the whole charade I just forgot to care about all the gory violence, not in the least due to its implausibility. Some scenes with Lithgow's terrifying cameo as the bad guy are even quite menacing and impactful. But at the end one only leaves with a taste of crassy action from cardboard characters in a staid plot.An ignorable number.

$review_text.: This is an original animated feature which takes all the material from the actual Watchmen comic, and comprises it into a single short-movie. This OVA('original video animation" to you non-otaku)is one of several animated video tie-ins to theatrically released live-action flicks like The Dark Knight, Van Helsing, and Chronicles Of Riddick. The parts of it that pertain to the film were left out for time, but mainly because they had no direct relevance to the main story. If you were to get the Watchmen Motion Comic, you'd see it as it was in the comic in relation to the events going on around the reader, who is a geek that uses pirate comics as a way to escape the sense of doom the world is heading towards in this "doomsday clock" alternate 1985.Tales Of The Black Freighter is a straight-up pirate/horror story about a sea captain who is the lone survivor of an attack on his vessel by a possibly-undead band of buckaneers. He makes it to a deserted island, along with the floating remains of alot of his crew including his first mate. The captain makes a raft out of the corpses, and heads home to warn of them of the mysterious Black Freighter which threatens to destroy their town. After seriously tripping out on some bad seawater, the captain makes it back home, but under the delusion that the town has already been sacked by the pirates. He subsequently murders two innocents he believes sold his people out, and bludgeons his wife(maybe to death)who he thinks is a pirate that's invaded his home. The captain then heads out to sea while being chased by the townsfolk, only to find the Black Freighter waiting for him. This played out like a great Tales From The Crypt-styled horror comic set in a pirate world. The animation is very well done too, a little different from the type your probably used to from Bruce Timm's style though.The other feature on this is Under The Hood, which is a live-action documentary about the life of Hollis Mason who was the first Night Owl(aka: "Night Owl I"). This is formatted like a TV news show from 1985 which looks back at an interview they did with Mason(Stephen McHattie)back in 1977 when his book tell-all book about being a superhero was released. They talk with Mason about being in the original Minutemen, which was the Golden Age superhero team that preceeded the Watchmen. They also have the original Silk Spectre too played by the totally fine Carla Gugino, who looks hot even back in the 70s. Plus, Matt Frewer(Max Headroom)as the retired supervillain Moloch is particularly creepy. This is a great secondary feature that compliments the rest of the Watchmen movie. There's also a documentary which partially goes over the regular Watchmen movie, and the making of Under The Hood. Also included is the first episode of the Watchmen Motion Comic.

$REVIEW.: I love this movie, I would give it 5 stars if I was just rating the movie


 However, this review is for the quality of the Blu Ray


It went on sale and I was very happy I was going to be able to replace my DVD copy


 As soon as I started watching it I realized the quality was possibly even worse than my DVD


 I would have to play them side by side to make an accurate assessment
 The picture was grainy and in some spots blurry

 The other odd thing was in scenes where Leonardo is wearing a white hat, there is a double halo/shadow effect going on


 When there is a scene with bright light (for example any outdoor scene) the entire shot is blown out


When it's dark, the black is grainy with no crispness whatsoever


I literally felt like I was watching an old VCR edition
This movie is so beautifully shot and such a wonderful story I am so disappointed the blu-ray didn't live up to my expectations.

$REVIEW.: I've seen these movies numerous times since I was a child, and every time a revisit them (particularly the original), I get something new out of them

 Why these movies are still relevant today is clear:  We are the apes, and the apes are us

 Intellegent design...The War in Iraq...Terry Schiavo...Sadly, Planet Earth is still being run by a bunch of d*** dirty apes

 After forty years, the monkeys are still in charge.The jewell of this collection is, of course, the 67 original
 For the few if any out there who haven't seen it, I will say that it contains perhaps the best ending of any sci-fi film in history
 The other films are not nearly as good ,especially the crappy Tim Burton film, the absolute worst in this collection
 Still, they are all entertaining in there own way


 I especially look forward to watching both the live action and animated TV series, neither of which I've seen in over 30 years.The ape head case is cool, I'll admit, but its also far too geeky to display in my living room


 I wish the films themselves were put in DVD size cases instead of CD size jewel boxes, so that I could put my films in my DVD collection and put the ape head in the closet

 But its really no big deal

 Since there are only 10,000 of these being produced, I guess I ruined its potential value by even opening it
 Oh well...

$review_text.: Sometimes a sequel does justice to the original


Other times...well...it doesn't

 This latter occasion is where we find ourselves with &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, the ambitious follow-up to Stephen Sommers' spectacular and financially successful 1999 offering &quot;The Mummy&quot;


 It is a victim of sequelitis, a condition caused by a studio's demand to fast track a sequel in order to capitalize on the first film's success


 This happens at the expense of the screenplay, actor preparation, and post-production turnaround.Everything about &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; is bigger, from budgets to sets and scope of story
Both &quot;Deep Rising&quot; and &quot;The Mummy&quot; proved that Sommers has a knack for mature storytelling that appeals to the youthful side of adult audiences, the same skill that helped George Lucas craft &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;
 Sommers also opted to develop the story like &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, presuming audience familiarity with all the returning characters and unabashedly self-referential to events in the first film
That's how Stephen Sommers wanted it, and there is absolutely nothing the matter with that
 Unfortunately, the release window for the film did not allow Sommers to draft a script worthy of his vision.&quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; is, at best, a collection of vividly imaginative sequences, appealing humor, and thrilling cliffhangers
 The problem, though, is that there is nothing beneath the glossy surface that allows the audience to connect with and care about either the story or the characters, save for the most inspired writing in the film - that being the scenes involving the kidnapped Alex, son of Rick and Evie
 Even some of that gloss remains rough and unpolished, especially during the last moments of the film when a large CGI creature is rendered so poorly that a Ray Harryhausen model would have been better.Perhaps the most symbolic element of the film's failings is Sommers' cinematography this time around


 For his combat scenes, Sommers employs the chaotic camera motions made famous in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot;

 The effect fails completely here, rendering what might have been some excellent duels, shoot-outs or whatnot into senseless, irrelevant blurs

 Sommers had a surefooted style he brought to his earlier works, but abandons here, no doubt feeling the pressure to create a &quot;hit&quot;
Ultimately, the problem with &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; is the fact that it could have and, with more time, would have been a much better film


 Even beyond its disappointments, the film gets a three-star rating based solely on the many wonderful characters Sommers created and the actors who pull off the roles so well

 There is much to commend about "The Mummy Returns", but the film it might have been will remain forever shrouded in the realm of "what if"

 Shame on the studio system for rushing this film out

 The strengths of Sommers' previous movies were the smart script and tight, well-paced plot
 Let's hope he lets his next screenplay/project stay buried a little longer before digging it out.

$REVIEW.: I rented this movie (with a free movie rental coupon) and even having paid nothing I was disappointed.  I really love Jennifer (Nora) and think she is a highly underrated actress.  It's unfortunate that she has to take roles like this that underutilize her talent.THe storyline is predictable and the characters underdeveloped.  The storyline depends upon too many stereotypical depictions of characters - the "good" girl, the "bad" girl, the thug, the homosexual male.I'm a big supporter of Af Am books and films, but I wouldn't recommend spending your hardearned money on this one.

and sadistic, sarcastic humor...what could be better than a restored version of the 11 season tv show?Many people have said they wish that there were more features like interviews and stuff..


but you gotta remember some of the cast incl


Lt Col Henery Blake are dead..
its 3 DVDs and even has sound tracks for French..

$REVIEW.: Anton (Konstantin Khabensky) is back, trying to fulfill his duties on the nightwatch, while suffering through his son's chosen allegiance to the dark
Filled w/ incredible action sequences and the same crazy, light-speed pacing, DAYWATCH is another russian masterpiece of apocalyptic madness! My favorite scenes include the "hotel hallway sportscar drive", "body switch", and "utterly frantic party climax"


My one wish / hope is that hollywood does NOT attempt to remake this (or Nightwatch) into its latest billion dollar mega-turd...

$REVIEW.: The film adaptation of Frank Miller's "Sin City" graphic novel is one of the strangest film experiences ever. The visual style is unique, probably one of the first films whose images are similar to those in the books.However, the plotting is weak. The four stories that encompass the movie are too short, and when one ends, we immeadiately jump into another one. For a normal film-goer, this could make it a confusing movie.Another draw-back is that the film is just too graphic. Some of the violent images are needless, and seriously detract from the film.The acting is good, though. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King and Jessica Alba give some of their best performances to date.Overall, this is a strange-but-good film that will mostly appeal to fans of the comic book.Movie/DVD Grade: B
$SUMMARY.: GREAT VISUALS, WEAK PLOTTING, GOOD PERFORMANCES!

$REVIEW.: In 1978, John Carpenter directed one of the most brilliant horror classics ever made.  This small budget film starred one of the first performances given by the wonderful and now immensely popular Jamie Lee Curtis, and was named 'Halloween'.  Over twenty years later, this film is still known as one of the best and scariest horror films ever produced.The plot is very basic, but it manages to be very affective in what it sets out do, which is to scare and petrify its audience.  It managed to do so back in 1978, and it still manages to do so today.  Michael Myers, who killed his sister when he was just a child, is now older and much smater.  He escapes from the mental institution in which he had been kept imprisoned for many years and returns to his small hometown of Haddonfield to wreak havoc on unsuspecting babysitters on Halloween night.  The scenes are very eerie and creepy, and the chilling music score makes the movie even more terrifying.Halloween has become a horror classic, and will remain so for an eternity.  Anchor Bay produces an excellent DVD with awesome, eye popping extras.  Never before has Halloween been so vividly clear with crystal clear audio.  The extras contained are trailers, tv and audio spots, a photo gallery, and a special feature called 'Halloween Unmasked 2000'.  This is a must own for any Michael Myers/horror fan.

$REVIEW.: I read "American Girl" a long time ago (and very depressing it is), and I thought this film would give me more background on Edie Sedgwick but I was wrong. It was basically little excerpts of the book (they even copy certain poses of her photos, like after the Chelsea fire) with some made-up stuff thrown in. Sort of a riches - to - rags theme.Edie (Sienna Miller) is all happy-happy and on her way to New York to become an artist.  However she attends a a party as she is wont to do and is introduced to Andy Warhol (Guy Pearce) who turns her head and puts her in movies, supposedly promising to pay her, but he never pays her. She runs up thousands in bills (but it doesn't show this), always assuming her trust fund will never run out.She meets Bob Dylan or "the musician" and falls madly in love and they have a soulful connection (he throws his motorcycle in the water to prove it doesn't mean anything to him).  The musician wants to take her away from all the madness that is Andy Warhol's Factory, but Edie chooses Andy instead and later (supposedly) tells an interviewer it was the worst decision she ever made. Yeah, right. Bob Dylan was already married or engaged and he was not about to step in and solve all Edie's problems. Who could? She throws a big fit at Andy telling him he has turned her into this mess, but later says she made all her own choices. Make up your mind, Factory Girl Edie.Her mom (who never did anything about her father trying to molest her, or so she tells her lawyer when she is begging him for money to pay her rent, in a very phony-looking move) is portrayed as a proper society matron, but in American Girl she seemed like a frumpy fraidy cow.Sometimes Miller looks almost like Edie (the dimples help)...but sometimes she looked and sounded like Ally Sheedy in St. Elmo's Fire. (On the cover of the DVD, she looks like a blonde Katharine Ross.) Her voice is not like Edie's. Towards the end, she starts looking and sounding a LOT like Liza Minnelli - maybe it's the desperation.If you don't have it, don't buy it.  I thought it would be better, and explain more about how she ended up the way she did. But there were just a few little things thrown in here and there amongst the party/drug scene.Two Stars for Guy Pearce.

$REVIEW.: 77 minutes of impressively nuanced Halloween pseudo-anthology goodness with diverse effects and expertly interwoven stories.  This movie blows away expectations.This fun little Halloween romp includes several interwoven stories.  Unlike most anthologies, all of the stories herein share the same writer and director (Michael Dougherty; only feature film as director).  So, also unlike most anthologies, there is a more consistent level of quality as we move from one short story to the next and there is no obvious beginning or end to each segment--instead they all overlap one another quite well.  Like in Creepshow, comic-book text boxes flag-post story shifts as light comedy and some downright silliness shine through to keep us smiling.  After all, who said Halloween couldn't be both gory and light-hearted?  Mixed among the stories is a nice variety: vampires, werewolves, zombies, serial killers and midget monsters.Here is a brief summary of the stories:1.  Four girls in cleavage-rich fairy tale costumes go out on Halloween night seeking manly fare.  The girls are played by Anna Paquin (True Blood, Scream 4, Darkness), Rochelle Aytes, Moneca Delain (Lost Boys: The Tribe) and Lauren Lee Smith (Pathology).  Paquin plays the shy virgin among a pack of experienced man-eaters.2.  A bus driver attempts to kill a bus full of mentally disturbed children and sort of succeeds.  This event (which is told as a scary story) is linked to a mean prank that some kids pull.  The kids include Britt McKillip (Mission to Mars) and Jean-Luc Bilodeau (Piranha 3DD).3+.  The overarching intro-to-closing story observes trick-or-treating and trick-or-treaters or all ages in a pleasant neighborhood.  Pleasant, that is, until people start dying at the hands of a strange diminutive murderer and a kid-killing school principal.  This &#34;story&#34; features really more than one story of its own and the cast features Leslie Bibb (Hell Baby, 7500), Dylan Baker (The Cell, Fido) and Brian Cox (Zodiac, The Ring).While not &#34;maturely&#34; or seriously presented, the writing felt sound, credible and free of any flaws that would provoke criticism.  Great, in fact, for this kind of movie.  A finer detail in this film is the effective use of jack-o-lanterns as a symbol of death.  Pay attention to what happens after someone blows a jack-o-lantern's candle out.  Also note that the bus driver and the principal each find themselves in more than one story.  Also pay attention as a murderer's child dresses as the murder, complete with a blood-stained shirt after murdering someone earlier in the film!  Now that is META!A fine job was done with the special effects.  There's no CGI (that I can tell) and every nuance worth showing got plenty of skillful attention.  The gore includes geyser-like vomiting, bloody bodies, severed heads, rubber guts, broken legs with exposed bones, stacks of corpses and a breasty flesh-stripping transformation scene.  I really dug the artistic license taken on the werewolf transformation scene!  It may seem a little dumb to horror fans at first glance, but it was done VERY well and it mingled fantastically with the &#34;girls in slutty costumes&#34; theme; they literally &#34;stripped&#34; off their human skin to reveal the wolf within.  Given the tone of the movie and the scene, it felt perfect.It saddens me that Michael Dougherty (the man behind this tactful movie) hasn't done anything in years.  I'd like to think he's working on his next horror masterpiece.  But I fear he's fallen into obscurity.This is far more worthy than any anthologies of the last 20 years in terms of overall quality.  So take the time this Halloween to enjoy this light-hearted masterpiece.

$REVIEW.: What can anyone say about "My Cousin Vinny" that hasn't already been said?  Since this movie first appeared in theaters it became an instant comedy  classic

I would wager a guess that nearly everyone between the ages of 12  and 80 has seen this film in some form or another, whether it be in the  theatre, on video or one of the many edited for television versions

But no  matter how many times you see it, you never tire of watching

You love to  watch those classic scenes over and over again, and it seems like they are  always funny


I won't waste time laying out the plot of the film, because  chances are you've already seen it, and if you haven't, may I ask what in  the world you are waiting for? For those of you that have seen it, how many  times have you been channel surfing, run across it and thought "Alright `My  Cousin Vinny' is on!" Yeah it's great to see it on TV, but nothing beats  the unedited version for a great laugh
Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei (Who won  an academy award for Best Supporting Actress in this film) are outstanding,  and who could forget the late Fred Gwynne (Herman Munster) as the surly  Judge Chamberlain Haller? If you don't own it, pick up a copy and put in  your video or DVD collection for those days when you can't find anything  good on TV

If you haven't seen it yet, then drag yourself out of the dark  ages and see one of the funniest movies you will ever watch.

$REVIEW.: *** This review may contain spoilers ***It's difficult criticizing a movie that's hailed as the greatest movie of all time. From the standpoint of cinematography, it might just deserve all the accolades that have been heaped upon it all these years. But my specific bone to pick with Citizen Kane is a story line that kind of runs out of gas.Orson Welles said that 'Kane' was not specifically about William Randolph Hearst but represents a sort of composite portrait of the rise and fall of a prominent American in the public eye. But one can see clearly that Welles had it in for Hearst. So much of the first half of the movie (up until the midpoint) is reminiscent of Hearst. And indeed it is the most compelling part of the picture. Up until half-way through Kane we feel that Welles is really being fair to his Kane-Hearst character who's depicted as charming but also capable of acts of megalomania. It's this multi-dimensional portrait throughout the first half that really grips our attention. Plot wise the stakes are raised until Kane's thunderous fall from grace when he's caught in a "love nest" with the "singer". This is the setup for the second half of Act 2 of the script leading to the 'point of no return' when Kane flips out after his second wife leaves him.Welles was faced with a big problem in the second half of his script--what to do with main character? The first half is so believable because it is based on the events of a real person's life. But when Welles looked to Hearst for inspiration for the second half of his movie, there really were few compelling conflicts LEFT for him to latch on to. In real life, Hearst continued to publish his newspaper, was sort of a recluse who didn't reveal much about his private life and did NOT have a bad relationship with the woman who he was involved with (in contrast to the relationship between the fictional Susan Alexander and Charles Foster Kane). So what did Welles do? He decided to create a false portrait of Hearst, a veritable straw man, which he could easily shoot down. Welles, the Hollywood 'progressive' now went into battle as the standard bearer, slaying the 'reactionary' Hearst. Kane-Hearst loses his charm and basically becomes almost completely unlikable in the second half of the movie. Welles grafts a 'character flaw' on to Kane-Hearst based on a man named McCormick, a Chicago heir who promoted the singing career of his no-talent mistress which is reflected in the Susan Alexander Kane story arc.By falsely depicting Kane-Hearst as a violent man obsessed with trivial pursuits, we no longer see a character who is multi-faceted. This is Welles deceiving himself that he's 'better' than William Randolph Hearst (despite Welles's disingenuous claims that the character was not really based on Hearst.)Citizen Kane is really the harbinger of things to come for Orson Welles's career--a career that ran the gamut from profound inspiration to adolescent narcissism. Technically Citizen Kane was probably the greatest film ever made and full of sensational performances. But at the same time Welles's elitist point of view and simple inability to follow through to complete a story full of great promise diminishes the overall impact (in small measure) of an American classic.

$REVIEW.: I recently flew to Seattle, and this was the in-flight film. I was intrigued, as I had never heard of it, and I enjoy Ben Stiller's movies. Moreover, this one was directed by Danny DeVito, and I had loved what he did with &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;. So, I settled down to watch what I thought might be a somewhat dark comedy. After watching it, I decided that this film was chosen for in-flight viewing, as the audience was a captive one and could not leave. Had I seen it in the theatre, I am sure I would have been witness to people leaving mid-film. To add insult to injury, this film was the same one shown on the return flight.The plot is simple. A young couple, Alex and Nancy, buy their dream home, a large and lovely  apartment in a turn of the century brownstone in Brooklyn. Replete with period detail, they fall in love with it, probably paying more than they should. The good thing is that the price includes an upper apartment, which is also part of the deal and would convert their apartment into a duplex. The only caveat is that the upper apartment is rented by an ancient  crone, Mrs. Connelly, who pays under a hundred dollars a month in rent, as the apartment is rent controlled.Still, they love the apartment so much that they buy it anyway, figuring that the tenant, whom they met, would not be there much longer due to her age and seeming ill health. Once they move in, however, Mrs. Connelly appears to have recovered her health and turns out to be quite an active and spry old woman who seems determined, in her own sweet way, to make the lives of the new owners a living hell on earth. Alex and Nancy hurry and scurry to meet their tenant's insatiable demands, which wreak havoc with their personal lives. This compels them to resort to various ways of getting her to move, all of which she seemingly resists without batting an eyelash. Finally, the harried, beleaguered couple is driven to seek a more permanent solution to their landlord/tenant problem.The film was clearly meant to be a dark comedy. It was dark, alright, because most everyone associated with it seems to have lost their way, but there is nothing really comedic about it. Ben Stiller's performance is strained, as he must have recognized early on that this film was not particularly funny. Drew Barrymore sleepwalks through her role as if she were on thorazine to quell any potentially psychotic behavior should she realize the turkey of a film in which she was acting. Harvey Fierstein manages to be annoying in the small, but pivotal, role of the real estate agent, while Swoosie Kurtz plays her role straight, rather than for laughs, and manages to avoid personal embarrassment.  The only real saving  grace is the performance by veteran British television thespian, Eileen Essel, in the role of Mrs. Connelly. She is the only reason the film warranted a rating of even two stars. Ms. Essel, however, must surely have a contract out on her agent for inducing her to make her feature film debut in this flop.

 The ending left me dry, unsatisfied, and frustrated


 The story was a superficial exploration of a variety of lives and times, none of which were done in-depth or with character substance

 The story floated but never went anywhere.

$REVIEW.: I didn't realize what I was getting into when I started watching this film.  I chose it for the stellar cast and because it was a story of friendship.  However, the brutality and despair in the film were a bigger part of the story than the friendship, in my opinion.  After I watched the film, I read the reviews and learned that the screenplay was based on a true story, although the State of New York denies it; but they would, wouldn't they?  It was a brilliantly acted film and I really enjoyed DeNiro and Hoffman's performances.

$review_text.: I enjoy a good zombie flick, but I am by no means a connoisseur within the genre. Regardless of my expertise (or lack thereof), though, this one leaves a lot to be desired on all fronts.First and most important, if you're in search of the Romero film by the same name you can stop reading now, because this isn't it. The similarities begin and end with the name of the movie and a couple of its characters. Second, the acting is about as good as the script allows: pleasantly average at best and incredibly bland and/or cheesy at worst. Third, the plot is basic (kill the zombies), and it fails every time it tries to pull off something higher (like character development or the backstory between the lead and her brother).The biggest drawback for me with this rendition of Day of the Dead is the zombies themselves. I'm something of an elitist when it comes to monster movies; I prefer my vampires to hail from Eastern Europe and be afraid of the light, I want my werewolves vulnerable only to silver bullets, and I like my zombies to be slow, mindless automatons motivated solely by the desire to taste human flesh. The zombies in Day of the Dead do not fit these criteria.Early in the film, the zombies bounce off the walls everywhere the main characters look. They move incredibly fast, they crawl on ceilings, and they can jump out of third story windows and sprint around without missing a beat. Without any explanation whatsoever, these same zombies are limited to running around at the pace of a quick jog for the entire second half of the film. Worse yet, some zombies demonstrate intelligence, others fire guns (?), and one retains about 50% of his human characteristics and never tries to eat anyone. Another zombie eats part of his own face. Yet another of the creatures passes up a tasty human meal to, again, eat/kill another zombie. My list of complaints goes on, but you get the idea.I tend to reserve one-star ratings for real stinkers, only the worst of the worst. While Day of the Dead is above that stature, it also gets worse as it progresses. The dialogue gets old quickly, and the ridiculous finale had me rolling my eyes. If you don't enjoy the first half hour, you'll hate the rest. My advice is not to waste your time on any of it.

You root for the main character, his family, and the others in his simple village, especially when they are attacked by the more powerful Mayans who live in the city.  However....it is extremely gruesome at times for no good reason (leave it to Mel Gibson--he doesn't want you to use your imagination; he has to make you look at the cruelty and the sacrifice and so on; after all, he made TPOTC), and the end leaves you wondering if there was any point or purpose at all.

$REVIEW.: I took my children to see Finding Neverland yesterday and today I can't wait for it to be released on Video.I expected Johnny Depp to be wonderul (he is), Kate Winslet to be beautiful and fabulous (she is) and the story to be winning (it is).  But I don't think I expected to be as moved by this beautiful story as I was.  There's just something about it--an aching beauty, I think I'd call it--that epitomizes the poignancy of childhood, love, and the human ability to dream that almost goes beyond the power of words to describe it.  It walks the edge of the precipice of innocence/experience in a watercolor balancing act that is as delicate and yet as durable and neverending as the circle of life itself.  I fell in love with every aspect.

$REVIEW.: I'm not a big fan of Roger Corman's cheaper-looking monsters (as in "the creature from haunted sea" et al), however, SWAMP WOMEN could certainly have used one of Corman's 8' styrofoam space-turds to spice things up a bit! Instead, we've got four women, consisting of 3 "hardened" criminals and one undercover cop, floating trough the bayou. We've also got Mike Conners and his half-wit girlfriend as hostages. It seems the "Nardo Girls" have escaped from prison in search of $200,000.00 in stolen diamonds. Unbeknownst to them, a policewoman is posing as their partner in crime. We get to see Conners tied to several trees, and his dopey girlfriend gets (thank you God) eaten by alligators. Eventually, the diamonds are found, the girls have one catfight after another (the only real highlight), and one decides to sneak off with both the diamonds and Mike Conners! This leads to her demise at the end of a spear. Beverly Garland isn't bad, but everyone else had me wishing for more gator attacks!. This film is 70 minutes long and would have been much better at 50 or so. Watch it if there's nothing else to do...

$review_text.: First off, let me say I believe Paul McCartney, former Wing, Beatle and Quarryman is alive and kicking

Why, may you ask, did I invest time and money in this DVD?Well, the answer really is very simple

Although I never bought into the whole "Paul is Dead" thing, I must admit to having a certain fascination with the phenomenon from the beginning
Call it morbid curiosity if you want (and no, I don't slow down to look at car wrecks.)I do remember when my friends and I first heard of this back in 1969 we couldn't wait to look at the album covers and listen more closely to song lyrics to see how anyone could have even started such a rumor


"Where did they get their information", we asked


Lo and behold, it was all there
We knew in our hearts that the Beatle bassman was alive but we still couldn't curb our curiosity.We didn't want Paul to be dead, but we did want to continue searching for "clues"
We came to the conclusion that the Beatles themselves were playing a joke on everyone, and I still feel that way.Having said that, let me say that this DVD could have been better


First of all, anyone who has ever heard George speak would know right away that this person on the tape was doing a very bad George Harrison impersonation


It sounds like the goofy voices used on the old Beatles cartoon show of the 60's

Does anyone remember that ? And then there was the time-line

It's all over the place


Nothing adds up
Rita (aka Heather Mills ) would be,oh, about 105 by now ,as would "Moxwell"

I cannot imagine the producers saw this as a serious (but seriously flawed) documentary

It has to be a put-on, a lark, a joke, another Rutles
These people seem to know as much about the Beatles as I do about heart surgery
To me, the whole Paul is Dead thing was fun


Simply the Beatles having a laugh, and us too.If you're interested in the phenomenon then by all means, get the DVD.Do it for fun
I only wish it had been done better.

$review_text.: So I originally posted this review with 3 stars, going into great detail and complaining about how incompetent a villain Khan was.  And then it took some time and thinking to realize the film isn't about Khan---it's about revelation and realization, that terrible sensation that is a common trope in any adventure series featuring close friends: the moment where one realizes that they are not invincible.Admiral Kirk has gone through the vast majority of his career smoothly, a stalwart hero as likely to resolve a conflict with words as with fists, and always able to rely on his trusty friends.And he's bored.  He's old, he's bored, and he can't stand it.His career-long invincibility was actually a crutch to him, as he had glided through for so long, always having an escape plan or a secret option to escape from defeat.  The Kobayashi Maru "no-win scenario" running plot-MacGuffin is in no way a Red Herring---it comes back around and smashes Kirk in the face when he realizes his refusal to accept a no-win scenario worked for him in the past, but it will never truly work out in the end.Spock dies.  That's not a spoiler; it's a forgone conclusion.  Spock's death isn't just a tacked-on "SHOCKING SWERVE~!" thing I had originally called it in my review.  Spock's death was in no way something to justify Khan being considered such a fiendish villain.Spock's death was that moment, that revelation.  It was the moment Kirk realized there IS no cunning solution to the Kobayashi Maru.  It was the moment Kirk realized he is NOT invincible.  Indeed, Khan (at least until movie three) did exactly what he wanted to do to Kirk---he hurt him.  And he made sure Kirk would go on hurting, for a long while.Kirk himself states at the end that he "feels young".  In fact, he does.  Having lost his best and closest friend, he is suddenly shown that he is not immortal, and he cannot loll through missions and commands expecting everything to work out in the end because it's "Star Trek".  He has cheated death all his life through all his missions, and death finally strikes him, not where it could do the most damage, but where it could HURT him most significantly.Khan is still a lackluster villain to me.  Ricardo Montalban is magic with his acting talent, and brings an epic, operatic quality to Khan Noonien Singh.  But that's about it.  There's a huge multitude of parallels with Khan, the character and the movie, involving "Moby Dick" and "Hamlet" and "King Lear", and spectacularly executed with Khan's mirroring of Captain Ahab, blindly chasing his quarry, to the death and destruction of himself.Above all, it's worth mentioning this is NOT an action movie.  It's an insult to this movie and it's dramatic, operatic quality to call it as such, especially when comparing it to "Star Trek: The Motion Picture".  It's a common barb of fans of The Motion Picture to claim people like Wrath of Khan more because it's more action-packed.No, it's not.  People like Wrath of Khan more because of the STORY and the depth and skill by which it is told, with deep themes on weighty issues such as death, aging, rebirth, and revenge, that resonate through all time, and are handled in a highly complex manner which most people would completely miss from their first viewing of the film, likely due to the stigma of "geekiness" and "goofy garbage" that Star Trek has."The Motion Picture" was an adaptation of a failed TV series pilot featuring the original crew.  It involved a 30 minute story dragged out to nearly 2 hours, with blatant padding all around, from a FOUR MINUTE UNCUT sequence of just Kirk and Scott looking at the Enterprise while SLOWLY flying around it in a transport pod, to EVEN MORE SEQUENCES EVEN LONGER of the crew just staring into V'Ger's cloud, and arbitrarily cutting back to people's faces as they stare out the window.  "2001" Star Gate sequence this ain't.The Motion Picture was full of long periods of nothing, and a very powerful theme of obsession---that of Kirk with command of the Enterprise---that was childishly "resolved" not by any character development or revelation, but by having the one person opposing his command (Decker) conveniently exit the picture without really dying, but more or less dying.Wrath of Khan does not avoid any weighty issues or themes.  There is no quickfix solution to anything.  Kirk can't just have Khan's ship explode, then shield the Enterprise in some kind of Nebular vacuum spot where he can survive the Genesis explosion.  Kirk can't just blast Khan out of the sky and fly home victorious.In some way, Kirk has earned redemption in this film for all the swaggering and slickness of his days of youth in The Original Series.  He is hurting, and he will go on hurting...At least until Star Trek III: Search for Spock.

$review_text.: Shot in the far northern regions of Canada, this well-done story of survival in the Arctic wilderness is also a fascinating 90-minute journey into the heart of Inuit culture. Covering only three months of time in 1953, the film follows the transformation of an arrogant and impulsive young pilot into a man of compassion, courage, and a native-inspired resourcefulness.The story is simple: a white man and an ill Inuit woman he has agreed to fly to a hospital are stranded on the trackless tundra when his plane crashes. Hundreds of miles from the nearest settlement, they wait for rescue that never comes. The short Arctic summer ends and winter looms as they face their dilemma separately and then together.The photography is stunning. It cries out to be seen on a big screen. The performances are wonderful, especially the 19-year-old Inuit actress, Annabella Piugattuk. Director Charles Martin Smith creates a movie experience that recalls his wonderful film, "Never Cry Wolf." The DVD has a high-spirited making-of-the-movie documentary which reveals much about the on-location logistics required to shoot a film under wilderness conditions, among polar bears (none of which appear in the film), and for part of the time under sub-zero conditions. A masterful achievement.

$REVIEW.: It is basically a ten hour movie that moves, I loved it.  I can sit down and watch all ten episodes back to back and stay riveted to the TV the whole ten hours.  I can't say that about the Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson.  This is ten times better than that.  I hope the quality continues on this show, this first season is off the charts amazing.  I can't say enough of the photograpy, the acting, the cast, the story, and the plot twists. This is just an instant classic.The show is almost 100% faithful to the 1st book in the 'A song of Ice and Fire' series and that is a very good thing.  The changes that were made do not affect the natural flow of the story and only serve to keep the show on point.  I cannot stress this enough, I have never EVER seen a better production on TV before!!!  This show is in a class of its own.  I am not the most Fantasy oriented person out there, but this show blew me away.  I hope that the DVDs include the extra stuff that was played on HBO like the 'making of game of thrones' etc.  Perhaps they will also throw in some added extras.  I cannot wait to get my hands on my copy of this show as I pre-ordered it as soon as it was posted on Amazon.I will make some updates on this review once I recieve my copy of the show.

$review_text.: The performances in this movie are outstanding, but Jeff Daniels is clearly the stand-out in his portrayal of Joshua Chamberlain. The late Richard Jordan is terrific as Louis Armistead, and Tom Berenger as James Longstreet is excellent. Solid acting is the standard here. Each moment of battle is guaranteed to leave you on the edge of your seat, as the action is fast and furious. The scenes between Armistead (Jordan) and Longstreet (Berenger) bring to life the depth of the torture Armistead felt at having to face his best friend, Union General Winfield Hancock on the battlefield. The scene in which Longstreet explains what will happen to George Pickett's division as it marches to the Union lines leaves you with a sense of anguish for the Confederate troops. There is really no accurate way to convey the horror of the three days at Gettysburg, but this picture comes close.

$REVIEW.: I'm going to be honest with you


I went out for a night on the town and ended up drinking too much


Last thing I remember, I was singing a karoake version of Kenny Roger's megahit "lady" in the basement of a local freemason

That's the last thing I remember
When I awoke in the morning, I was aghast to find myself nude and painted blue, with a Llama eating grass in my backyard

Even worse, I had this movie superglued to my right bicep


I decided to watch it

mistake!Let me point out that I am not a filmaker
I know it is very easy to criticise what other people have created, but much more difficult to actually create something

I do not know anything about how to write a movie script, or what a gaffer does, or any of that


All I know is what I like to watch

One thing I do not like watching is a man with a mustache that can only be described as "retarded" running, walking, and biking all over a fake british countryside

But friends, that is what you get


You could take half the footage from this "film" and make a documentary on how to use your feet and legs for locomotion purposes

The rest of the movie could then be spliced together and shown to people you don't like for revenge purposes.Holy balls


What can I say that hasn't been said before by the other unfortunates who have witnessed this movie? I used to judge movies based on a simple schematic
A good movie is one that is near the brilliance of such films as Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, and Dolemite

A bad movie is one that would rank somwhere in the vicinity of House of the Dead


Guess what? House of the Dead is better than this movie


we have a new bottom of the barrel DVD! On a scale of one through ten, ten being the highest, and one being the lowest, this movie gets an F-.On the upside, I did throw up while watching this, which made my hangover abate somewhat
Also, I did watch the whole thing, and seeing as this movie is about thirteen hours long, my hangover had actually gone away by the time it was over(I am the kind of guy who looks for a silver lining).In summation, I must advise that every single person on earth not watch this movie


Don't watch it to make fun of it

Don't watch it to see skeletons on fire that magically thrash around even though their muscles are absent

Don't watch it to see the sweet acting during the Thunderchild sequence


And most of all, don't watch it just because it's glued to your bicep


This isn't Russia, so people have rights, and that includes the right to not watch movies like this.Man, this makes Gigli look good.

$REVIEW.: "The Night of the Headless Horseman" is the 3D animated version of Washington Irving's famous story, and this made-for-TV film follows the original story pretty faithfully. It also has interesting voice cast - William H. Macy as Ichabod Crane, Luke Perry as Brom Bones, Tia Carrere as Katrina Van Tassel, Mark Hamill as Van Ripper and Clancy Brown as Hessian Trooper, or the titular horseman.However, you might find the film's visuals disappointing by the standard of today (I means, 2007). You know you cannot have the quality of Pixar here, but even so, the computer graphics of the film are not up to the standard we now expect. The characters' facial expressions fail to express their emotions even with the capable voice acting, and they sometimes move their limbs and heads very awkwardly.I know time is not kind to the computer graphics (no one would say the same things about Disney's classic `Fantasia' created with traditional 2-D images), and probably it is not fair to complain. But this Washington Irving film is released in 1999, one year after `A Bug's Life `and two years before `Monsters Inc.' and if you compare the two films (both my favorite), you notice during three years we have seen tremendous technological progress in the field of CGI-based animations. Sadly "The Night of the Headless Horseman" seems to be unaware of the technologies in visuals, or - this is more serious - the tactful skills of storytelling and imaginative visual designs that these films are proud of.Probably this film would have been better with more creative designs. The horse chase scenes at the climax are fairly thrilling, but the daytime scenes are sometimes terrible, especially the scenes of the kids in Ichabod's school, who look like badly sketched figures on the video games. Ichabod retains the original's image as lank person and "worthy pedagogue" as Irving wrote, but perhaps the filmmakers took the writer's words too literally as he wrote Katrina as a "plump" "country coquette."The film's horseman claims `Any head will do,' but the fact is in animation that is not simply true. This animated film needs improved visual technology, or at least better storytelling and wild imagination.

$review_text.: Although the movie is not &quot;bad&quot; it pales in comparison to the music Duke Ellington recorded for this 1961 film. Mixing a bit of contemporariness to many of his otherwise &quot;historical&quot; masterpieces, Duke found a magic line and made it grand. Such works as 'Battle Royale' are a testament to just how hard he could swing his men. The CD does feature a nice multi-media component for your PC which contains a high quality original movie trailer for those film buffs who are interested in such extras. The addition of movie 'snippetts' however, tends to get on my nerves. There is no point, in my opinion, to interrupting the music with random movie 'dialogue'. One should simply see the movie for this. Overall this is however, a very worthy CD with some GREAT quality Ellington recordings. Recommended.

$REVIEW.: Hands down my favorite Western Movie of all time.  (I'm a huge John Wayne fan as well.)It is as if Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones were born for these parts.  (All the casting is perfect - I wouldn't change one thing)This movie almost EXACTLY follows the book - and you gain very little extra by reading the book.  Few extra tidbits by reading the book: (SPOILERS)1) Sheriff in Arkansas wife who runs off... was a whore. She only married Jeremiah Johnson after knowing him for two weeks to get away from some guys who were using her really rough.  You see her hatred for Jeremiah and her son in the movie, but the book describes this hatred in great detail and shows what a ROTTEN human being she is.  In the movie your slightly sad that she dies.  After reading the book - you are happy she died as the earth has one fewer scumbags.2) Newt isn't hit over the head by Blue Duck when Lorena is kidnapped.  That should be obvious that it is a deviation from the book because Blue Duck is a cold blooded killer.  He would have gutted Newt like he does everyone.  In the book - Blue Duck causes a stampede and that gets Newt caught away from watching Lorena - and that is when Blue Duck steals her.3) The horrible men that Jake Spoon falls in with - they kill just a few more people in the book.4) Roscoe has a few more bumbling adventures including meeting a frisky widower farm girl... kinda creepy, and the scene with the bandits on the road and Janey throwing rocks is way different in the book with a different outcome.  Sheriff Johnson does come save the day - but he arrests the men and puts them in jail.That's the major stuff that I can think of.  Everything else is really close.  Excellent movie.  5 Stars.

$review_text.: Remember my review of The Wizard of Oz on how heartwarming it is? Well, oh boy, let's talk about the long-awaited spin-off sequel, Return to Oz


For starters, it is quite a departure from its predecessor and more like the big kid version of Oz


It is rated PG, it is dark, a little scary, and is not a musical at all


Six months later, Dorthy (Fairuza Balk) is so obsessed with her adventures in Oz that she had difficulty sleeping and Em (Piper Laurie) is worried

Em drops Dorthy off at a mental clinic in the care of Dr


Worley (Nicol Willamson) and Head Nurse Wilson (Jean Marsh)
As they are about to treat Dorthy's condition with electroshock therapy, the power goes out and a mysterious girl (Emma Ridley) warns her about the other patients taking on brain damage and helps her escape to safety


Head Nurse Wilson chases them to a river, where the mysterious girl disappeared and Dorthy hitched a ride in a crib and the drift takes her back to Oz
Once Dorthy awakens, she sees Billina, one of the chickens from the farm who can now talk human (dialogue provided by Denise Bryer)

They discover that Munchkinland disappeared, The Yellow Brick Road was damaged, Emerald City is in ruins with everyone turned into stone, especially the Tin Woodsman (Deep Roy) and the Cowardly Lion (John Alexander), and the Scarecrow (Justin Case) is missing


A gang of Wheelers chased after the two since Dorthy is being targeted by the Gnome King (also Willamson) and Mombi (also Ridley) and that the Gnome King does not permit chickens in Oz
Dorthy meets a wind-up robot Tik-Tok (voice of Sean Barrett) and the three encounter Mombi who imprisons them in a tower where they meet Jack Pumpkinhead (voice of Brian Henson)


The gang formulate an escape plan to get to the Gnome King's Mountain to rescue Scarecrow
Dorthy steals a bottle of life powder from the storage compartment of Mombi's original head, while the others put together a flying sofa with the head of a gump


Dorthy brings the Gump (voice of Lyle Conway) to life
Together, the group fly to the mountain where they discover that the Scarecrow tried to save the emeralds of Emerald City from the Gnome King's clutches, but the Gnome King got revenge by transforming him into an ornament

When Dorthy returned to Kansas, she was so anxious to return home that she forgot to remove the ruby slippers and they fell off her feet and landed into the Gnome King's hands

In other words, the onset of Oz's destruction was Dorthy's fault


They rescue the Scarecrow and the Gnome King tries to eat everyone

Fortunately, Billina, who was hiding in Jack's head, drops an egg into the King's throat
Since chicken eggs contain an acid substance that is quite harmful to gnomes, the Gnome King crumbles to pieces
Dorthy equips the slippers and teleports the group out of the rumbling mountain and back to the restored Emerald City where Mombi was captured

Dorthy frees the mysterious girl that previously rescued her in the beginning, revealed to be Princess Ozma

Ozma uses the slippers to return Dorthy to Kansas, after saying goodbye to everyone, for now
Dorthy wakes up in a river bank where she was found by Toto (Tansy), Em, and Henry (Matt Clark)

The visual effects were an improvement

They were more advanced and complex

The animatronics were pulled off really well

The stone gnomes that used clay animation were quite original
They did a good job mixing the claymation and real-life motion together


There were a few plot holes as well

The original ended with the house still in Kansas, but in the sequel the house was not


While Dorthy seemed to be in her mid-teens with Em and Henry in their late 40's in the original, but in this sequel they looked noticeably younger (pretty close to the books)
The Scarecrow, Tin Woodsman, and Cowardly Lion were humanoid in the original which helps them display facial expressions, but in this entry, they looked more accurate to the books and hardly has such expressions

Even though both films are great classics, the original just barely wins
While this sequel had a deeper and darker storyline with better visual effects, the original had more heart to it with memorable songs thrown into the mix
If you see any of these films in rental stores, please buy or rent them


They don't disappoint.

$review_text.: Having grown up on these cartoons, I jumped at the chance to get the first four volumes, with the first three together as a package, at a nice discount.There were also some extras, such as isolated soundtracks, alternate takes, and occasional documentaries.Classic is a very overused term these days, but these wonderful old cartoons exemplify classic in every way, from the wonderful animation, instantly recognized sound effects, truly funny story lines, and (possibly most of all) the voice of the legendary, late and very great Mel Blanc.If you grew up watching these, you already know what I am talking about.If you haven't had the pleasure of watching cartoons the way they were MEANT to be, I must urge you to buy at least one volume, and I bet you will be hooked.I will sound like one of those old fogies when I say it, but Spongebob Squarepants simply pales in comparison to these.Oh, and your kids will LOVE you for it!Amazon's shipping was peerless, getting them to me on Thursday morning, after I had ordered them on Saturday afternoon.Now, THAT is service!

$review_text.: Baz Luhrmann brings back the musical to the movie scene with Moulin Rogue.  Mr. Luhrmann succeeds with the visual aspect of the movie.  The imagery is striking with stunning sets and beautiful cinematography.  Nicole Kidman is absolute breath taking as the doomed Satine.  She shines every moment she graces the screen.  The problem with Moulin Rogue is that the storyline is weak and there are basically no original songs.  The movie is based in 1899, but the songs are mostly from the rock era.  In one scene a young writer played by Ewen MacGregor sings Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot; to Ms. Kidman and in another the Moulin Rogue's owner Jim Broadbent sings &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; to a Duke (Played snarkly by Richard Roxborough) who is in love Satine and wants her in return for financing a play.  It is a weird juxtaposition of time periods that works to a degree because the songs have a built in popularity, but it lacks the creativity of the original scores for musicals of old.  Overall, Moulin Rogue is worth watching for the look and Ms. Kidman.

It's not fit for the little ones as it has some very gory, graphic, and scary scenes so make sure you put your babies to bed before watching this. It has all the right elements for being a cult classic and has really good acting. It's good to have for the library collection of best horror movies ever as it will scare the you know what out of you in a couple of places. The ending is bittersweet and sorta sad but I'm not going to spoil it for you. I'd recommend watching this movie if you like to blend the weird with the macabre. Alice Krige gives a spectacular performance!

$review_text.: I originally called Amazon CS because all of the reviews for this movie were comingled so that you could not determine which vendor had the superior sight and sound quality


I wanted to avoid returning a film because of poor quality

previous reviews for this film expressed the same frustration over the comingling on the Amazon reviews for this film, yet there was no change implemented

Well my concerns were justified because this vendor and film had unacceptable sound quality whereby I had to turn my Sony Surround Sound up so high to hear the film that it caused a hum in my speakers


The sight part of the film was better than the sound


Since the sound was unacceptable, I returned it to Amazon.My second choice was Gung Ho! The Movie; WW2 The attack of Makan Island by USMC Marines 1942 old films DVD by Campbell Films

This version was overwhelmingly superior to the previous film version
The sound track ran at regular levels on my Sony Surround Sound with no hum! Campbell Films Created a new jacket for the DVD based on live footage

They digitized the original footage and included actual footage from the returning heroes on their submarines as they docked

In addition, Campbell Films included (2) two other DVDs which included Newsreel Footage from the period as well as "Victory at Sea" DVD


You can see my full review of my second choice the Campbell's version of Gung Ho
Hope this helps.Blessings,Phil

$review_text.: You get 3 Mad Max films in this 3-disc set. Overall, the picture and audio quality are very good. The amount of audio and language options is insane. The real problem is that the special features on this release are light. There is only 30 minutes total for all 3 films, 2 audio commentaries and nothing except the trailer for the third film (the 52-minute 'Making of Beyond Thunderdome' and other previous extras aren't included). This franchise deserves much more in the way of bonus content (such as a 3-hour retrospective documentary) in a future release. Fans who own Mad Max and Road Warrior on Blu-ray may not want to upgrade because of the light treatment this set receives. I give the films 4 stars but this set gets 2 stars.

$review_text.: "Along Came A Spider" is a prequel to the 1997 film, "Kiss the Girls" which also starred Morgan Freeman as detective Alex Cross.  Detective Cross is a serial kidnapper profiler who becomes involved in a cat and mouse chase that ensues when the daughter of a US Senator is abducted from her high security private school.  In order to solve the crime Freeman teams up with the head Secret Service agent in charge of security at the kidnapped child's school, a dubiously cast Monica Potter.  Since I am only used to seeing Ms. Monica frolic about in lightweight chick flick films I was surprised to see her granted such a meaty role...but anyway.This is the sort of movie that is better if you know as little about it as possible so I will not spoil it for you by getting into details.  I will say that, like a spider's web, the plot is as intricately woven and full of dead flies (just kidding about the flies).  Some parts of the story are completely unpredictable and exciting while others are almost expected...but in the end you'll wonder about the expected parts...that's all I can say.Freeman does a fine job in his role...but he's had enough practice don't ya think ("Kiss The Girls", "Seven").  Potter, though at first seemed only cast for her pretty face, really pulls off her role well-I have to admit that I was surprised and as a results she's chalked up a few points in my book.Recommendation:  This film is interesting, suspenseful, and well worth the watch.  The people I've spoken with have given it mixed reviews.  Like it or not (you'll probably like it unless you have ESP like my Mom...she always figures out the who-done-it's before she even sees the film...well, that what SHE says)  you'll have a strong opinion and it will give you lots of fuel for debate.  "Along Came A Spider" is no "Silence of the Lambs", but to give it a little more credit...it's also no "Kiss the Girls" (and I mean that in a good way).  You'll be thinking about this movie long after the final credits have rolled (check out the credits for "man who can't answer the phone" and "potentially evil guy on train", I'm serious!).

$review_text.: Although the premise of this movie is far fetched it works because of its sweetness and fantasy.Jennifer Garner plays a woman who gets transported from her 13 year old birthday party straight into her 30's, by passing all the joys of childhood and puberty she finds that she has turned into a horrible grown-up in more ways than one. Garner is pure innocence and absolutely infectious in this silly role that few actresses could have pulled off so well. As a modern woman sophisticated enough to be an editor for a fashion magazine in New York she fumbles about as the transported child/woman and causes quite a havoc in her childish wake. The pranks and gags are funny especially the constant references to that great old era "the 80's", completed by the "Thriller" dance remake that will have you dancing or laughing or both!Mark Ruffalo is cast as the love interest for Garner. As her childhood best friend he has become lost in the shuffle of Garner climbing to the top and he gets lost far behind. But as the child/woman Garner finds all that she missed along the way and the puppy love begins. Ruffalo is a great guy, not too macho and not too pretty so he manages to come across perfectly as the best friend that waits patiently in the wings and he is adorable.This movie works for adults as well as teenagers and is a pleasant film to watch. If you know the 80's it is filled with funny nostalgia and great music. If you skipped your childhood bent on success this film will encourage you to find that playfulness and inventiveness that so many adults lack. Colorful and fun this movie ROCKS with plenty of magic dust to take us all back a few years to the land of enjoyment.

$review_text.: Its a shame that I never even heard of this movie except by chance on amazon.com's list of "best movies you've never even heard of" (or something like that). As I read the list of actors in the film, I was surprised how this one fell through the cracks. It has Henry Thomas, Patrick Swayze, Barbara Hershey, Hilary Swank, Colin Hanks, Rachel Leigh Cook, and the always good Sean Hatosy. With a cast like that, how did it not get the kind of media attention that "Crash" got?Maybe because it was made by a debut "Generation X" director, Greg Marcks. Like "Donnie Darko" director Richard Kelly before him, Marcks got shafted on the publicity machine. I saw "Crash" in theaters and really liked it. But for all its clever coincidences, I found the story quite unbelievably contrived (as the film characters are connected in surprising ways, which takes place in the huge megatropolis of Los Angeles). When I read the description for "11:14", it sounded a lot like "Crash" but came out a year or two earlier. After watching it, let me tell you...I have never had such a mind-blowing experience watching a film before. This film had me riveted as I watched how all the story segments fall into place. By the end of the movie, I was like "whoa!" Brilliant, man. Absolutely brilliant!Like the movie "Crash", this one involves a couple car accidents and the ways the people involved are all connected to one another. To reveal any more is to ruin the film experience. All I can say is that the performances were really good. I've been a fan of Henry Thomas since "E.T.", since he is the same age as me and I related to his Elliot character back then. He's a good actor who deserves to be in more films. Patrick Swayze in this reminds me of the small but pivotal role he played in "Donnie Darko", which leads me to wonder why he's playing in such minor roles, being directed by Generation X director. Barbara Hershey, another actress I like from the 1980s, seems to reprise her role in the film "Lantana", but this role is simply too small, but she manages it well. However, I think this film showcases the talents of Sean Hatosy, who is becoming one of my favorite actors by how well he makes his facial expressions. From "Soldier Girl" to "Faith of My Fathers" to "11:14", I really hope his career launches into more leading man status or at least a buddy film. He is definitely the actor to watch.When the final scene occurs and all the pieces fall together, I was so amazed by its brilliance that I had to watch it again, and then again with the director's commentary track. This is a film that I would've seen in theaters had it been better publicized and distributed. As far as first films go, you can't get better than this. Like director Richard Kelly, I believe Greg Marcks is another one to watch. If you enjoyed "Crash" and "Memento", you'll probably love this film as well. And memo to Hollywood...don't be afraid to take risks on unconventional storylines. This movie far exceeds the formulaic action/romantic-comedy/suspense films you dish out to audiences year after year. This film leaves a lasting impression and really blows your mind away with its implication. Its what every viewer wants to experience when they watch a movie.

$review_text.: There have been some great horror films in the 20th century. Hitchcock was responsible for probably a half dozen himself. The more recent &quot;The Others&quot; comes to mind, and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. But nothing compares to Henry James' tale of horror in Turn of the Screw, aptly named THE INNOCENTS for film. Deborah Kerr is perfectly cast as the governess of two children who seem to be possessed by two tragic ghostly figures that only the governess can see. Creepy, haunting, a movie you probably don't want to watch alone, though I have. Great cast. Director Jack Clayton has the perfect touch. Though I am giving the film itself 5 stars, I wouldn't give the VHS version a high mark at all. The audience is forced to watch this magnificent film in the dreadful 'full screen' mode. All we see are mouths and noses at times. If the studio doesn't want to release the film on DVD, at least bring out a special 'wide screen' VHS version so we can see the movie as it should be seen. Or, better yet, release THE INNOCENTS on DVD. It deserves as much attention as most classics.
$SUMMARY.: The best horror film ever made...Deborah Kerr is superb.

$REVIEW.: It's fast becoming clear that stagings in European opera houses these days are by and large in the unwittingly trite "tradition of no tradition."  To the claim that one can't do new productions in the same old manner, I'd reply that it's hard these days to see any productions that respect those historical particulars that would allegedly maim a new staging.  What we are regaled with instead is an operatic theater featuring the philistine set designer and barbaric costumer as stars.  These fashionistas are devoid of any depth of respect for the works they stage, focusing instead on a sort of colorless and mindless minimalism.  No discernible fresh but relevant ideas are behind the changes these persons choose to introduce; if there were any, one might be able to make a case for them.  Instead, what we have is a parade of repetitive and uniform ugliness.What is not recognized is that it's the intensity and passion of the composer and the performers that allow a work from the past to transcend a specificity of time and place to achieve universality.  It is manifestly not mere costumes and sets, altered for no discernible purpose.  The real innovation these days would involve a demotion of these princes of decor to an appropriate subordinate place.Fortunately, this production features an all stops out performance by Gruberova which can make one forgive much.  Even in late career, her work is distinguished for its beauty and passion, and it makes the viewer wish the fashionistas involved in this production had seen the same power in the work that Gruberova surely did. Then the DVD might have merited 5 stars.

$REVIEW.: Back in the summer of 1990 a little show aired during the summer entitled THE SEINFELD CHRONICLES. For a summer filler show, it did alright in the ratings and was eventually picked up for a full half season. Eventually the name was shorten to simply SEINFELD and thus began one of the funniest and most inventive comedies of the last quarter of the twentieth-century. The elite and the ignorant alike refer to SEINFELD as being the first television show about nothing. Well, SEINFELD really is about something--it's about everyday life. In some ways, because of how personal Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld made the series, it is in some ways one of the most realistic comedies about life every produced.  The show was and always will be pure genius.Volume 1 off the SEINFELD series offers the 1st and 2nd season of the show.  Including the pilot episode, the 1st season only included 5 episodes. However, even in a few of these early episodes, the genius of the show can be seen. In "The Stake Out" George makes the first reference to his dream of being an architect and in "The Robbery" Kramer makes his first big impression when he leaves Jerry's apartment door open while Jerry is on a trip and is robbed.The 2nd season includes 13 episodes--a full half-season. In "The Chinese Restaurant" Jerry, George, and Elaine spend thirty minutes waiting for a table at a Chinese Restaurant (this is the show the coined the series as being a show "about nothing"). In "The Phone Message" George begins to truly blossom as he leaves a series of nasty phone messages on his new girlfriend's machine because she hasn't returned his calls, only to discover that she has been out of town. In "The Statue" Kramer truly comes into his own as he steals back a statue that a cleaning guy stole from his apartment.  In "The Revenge" George is fired for the first time and decides to take revenge on his former employer, while Jerry & Kramer plan to get revenge on the laundry guy for stealing some money.  The volume is closed out by "The Deal"--an episode that was originally intended to be the final show in the series.The DVDs include a plethora of extras. Each disc includes 1 or 2 audio commentaries. These are entitled Yada, Yada, Yada. Unfortunately, I found most of these commentaries rather boring. They don't provide any real new information or insight about the series and really serve as filler and not much more.Each episode can be played with a feature called Notes About Nothing. This is kind of like a pop-up video feature that pops up various information about the episode throughout he viewing. There's a ton of info there, but at times it's hard to keep up and is almost too much.About half of all the episodes feature Inside Looks. These are a series of interviews with the cast & crew about a particular episode. I enjoyed these the most of all the extras because they are short and informative.Other extras include a special introductions to "The Stake Out" and "The Stranded", deleted scenes, special Stand-Up material, bloopers, photo galleries, NBC promos & trailers, a few selected spots from "The Tonight Show", and a documentary entitled "How It Began."  Outside of the Inside Looks, I found the documentary and "The Tonight Show" segments to be the best extra features in this set.Volume 1 of SEINFELD might not be the best episodes of the series, but it is where & how the show began. A great item for any SEINFELD fan or anyone else who wants to see the origins of some classic modern tv.

$review_text.: My wife is of Italian descent, which I expect was the main reason she bought this DVD.As you doubtless already gathered, it's set in Italy - mostly Rome - less than 10 years after World War II

The movie focuses on three American secretaries, two of whom work for a U.S

government agency, so it's seen from a decidedly American point of view

Which is to say the Italians are portrayed largely as simple jolly buffoons all of whom - except for a prince and his snooty mother - are socially inferior to the Americans in their midst.It's loaded with 1950s American sexual morality and attitudes, which seem horribly dated 50 years on.But mostly, I got the feeling that the director couldn't decide whether he was making a drama or a Cinemascope travelogue of Rome and Venice.The ending is hackneyed in the extreme and leaves you with as many questions as answers.I saw this in my hometown theater when I was 9

I didn't get it then and now, even with nearly 60 years of living in my database, I still don't get it
I think it's because there's nothing here to get
It's just fluff.

$REVIEW.: I recently saw this movie on television and knew that it needed to be in my DVD library


 This film is about a bacteriologist (Edward Norton) who very quickly falls in love with a young lady (Naomi Watts), they marry, and he takes her back to China where he's stationed as a English civil servant

 She doesn't really love him when they marry and tells him that, but she looks at marrying him as a way to get out of her home and away from her mother since there aren't any other prospects for her


 In China she gets bored with him and her life there and winds up having an affair with a low level English diplomat

 I won't say any more but suffice it to say that this movie just slowly sucks you in -- the art direction, the photography, the styling -- you feel as if you're in China in the 1930's
 The acting is superb, in my opinion, because it is not-in-your-face

 Rather, it is subtle and there are moments when a glance, or smirk, or a move of the head evokes the feeling vs
words
 Naomi Watts seems perfect for the part of the wife, and Edward Norton plays the repressed, formal English man to perfection


 The supporting cast - especially Toby Jones, are also superb

 Too bad that this movie didn't garner more attention when it came out because it certainly deserves a viewing

 It's a different kind of love story with no violence, no naked bodies, no CGI graphics, no swearing, no car/motorcycle/truck action shots -- that explains why it probably didn't make $300 billion dollars at the box office

 Oh well....

$review_text.: Paul Krugman once said of Newt Gingrich "He's a stupid man's idea of what a smart person sounds like."In that vein, Prometheus is a stupid man's idea of what a smart film is like.The constant comparisons to 2001 are ludicrous, as if by having a space-guy dissolve himself into a body of water and then not answering why is somehow "deep". The argument I make is that the film isn't actually mysterious nor intelligent but actually completely dumb. Add lazy as well...if you are going to be "smart" and "deep", don't waste time on useless story bits and dues ex plot movement just to move to the next scene. Put effort into it.I'm not going to rehash over everything that everyone else has said, suffice to say that the film could have been just as mysterious and beautiful without the terrible story thrown in. The roles that fill little purpose and do not move the story forward; the "gotcha" moments that were cliche when Alien came out. The twists that don't add up to anything at all.Scott still has a master's eye. That is not in doubt. What is in doubt is Scott's ability it seems to pick terrible stories or terrible writers to tell those stories. This is one such example. Where is the man who created Blade Runner?I give the film 2-stars if only for its beautiful rendering and eye for detail over CGI.

$REVIEW.: I think it's difficult to write a review for this movie without comparing and contrasting it with the US remake, but I will do my best.  In my opinion, neither film is perfect.  Some things worked better in Ringu, and some things worked better in The Ring.  But what I loved about both films is the way that both stories are different from each other, so that you can watch both and get something out of each one.The new trend of remaking Asian horror films seems to come from this movie.  I can't understand why people get so upset about it, though.  For one thing, before the remake, it was impossible to get the original in America.  If you think this is such a great movie, why wouldn't you want more people to see it?  Also, with all the films Hideo Nakata has made, this is by no means his best work.  Most people I hear complaining about the American remake have never even seen anything else he's ever done.  Most importantly, with this film in particular, a remake is a very fitting choice, because it actually fits into the context of the story.  I can't elaborate on that, but when you see it, you'll understand what I mean.The story centers around Asakawa, her son Yoichi, and her ex-husband Ryuji.  Asakawa is a reporter investigating rumors surrounding a mysterious video tape that local youths have been saying will kill the viewer one week after watcing it.  The inquiries take on a more personal meaning for her when her niece turns up dead under unexplained circumstances.  After a bit of poking around, Asakawa finds herself in the presence of the killer videotape.  So what does she do?  Of course she watches it!  Now that may not sound like the smart thing to do in a situation like this.  At least the other unsuspecting victims watched it by mistake.  But you know how those snoopy reporters are.  If you found a copy of a videotape that killed people, wouldn't you at least want to know what was on it?Unfortnunately, the payoff isn't that great.  The videotape is a mishmash of weird yet boring images, and if I had turned in something like that for my experimental film project in "Film Analysis: Formalist and Feminist" class, I would not have passed.  Once Asakawa has gotten over her initial curiosity, she freaks out and calls Ryuji to help her find out what she can do to break that curse.The main problem I have with this film is the character of Ryuji.  He is fascinating, and the actor playing him is very talented.  However, his character has had such a great arc from the novel, to the film, to the remake, that it seems that the screenwriter didn't know what to do with him.  In the novel, Asakawa is a man, and Ryuji is his detestable friend.  He despises humankind, and entertains Asakawa with stories about breaking into women's houses and raping them.  I think making Asakawa a female, and Ryuji her ex was a brilliant move.  They've got seven days to find the origin of the video tape, which is not nearly long enough to reconcile their personal differences.  However, his character had to undergo a great transformation between the novel and the film.  If they had him be as reprehensible as he was in the book, a strong female like Asakawa never would have had anything to do with him.  However, they had to keep some of his jerkiness in tact, because they were filming the sequel at the same time, and his evil nature played a part in it.  (This is "Rasen," not "Ring 2."  "Rasen" is based on the second novel, but the movie turned out so crappy that Nakata had to make his own alternate sequel, "Ring 2," which was a completely new idea.)So Ryuji appears here as somewhat of a contradiction between two selves.  And for some reason, they chose to give him psychic powers.  His psychic abilities were not in the novel, and I don't think they added anything to the story.  His powers allow the villian, a young woman named Sadako, to appear right in front of him when he's sitting on a park bench.  He remains calm, and actually speaks to her.  Then later, when they want to make him be scared, he is so scared that he can't move.  The character is interesting, but disjointed.  In the remake, the writer seemed to consider all of this, and made Noah, the ex, a complete flake, and somewhat of a coward.  His contribution was his expertise in video equipment, not a staggering intellect.It is difficult to say too much more about this film, as there is so much more to learn that I don't want to give away too soon.  But what works here is that the story makes use of modern technology intertwined with a traditional ghost story.  Televisions, VCR's, telephones, these are all modern inventions not usually associated with ghosts.  We don't typically put ghosts and technology together because they are otherworldly in death, and it is assumed that they came from a more primitive time in life, before these things were invented.  That's why a techno update of the ghost story works, because it scares us with things we never thought of as scary before.If you are a fan of the recent wave of Japanese horror, or the American version of The Ring, you owe it to yourself to see this film.  It should be noted that the famous scene near the end that everyone remembers from The Ring was not in the novel, but was an invention of Hideo Nakata.

$review_text.: I'll admit it, I'm a fantasy/comic book junkie

 Hey, that's okay, comic books are now in style and it seems as if a comic book movie is coming out every other month, with a fantasy movie coming out in the months between
 Having said that, I will also say I don't like a movie because it fits that criteria
 Two examples would be "Hellboy" and "Daredevil"...two movies which could have been better but were unfortunately lacking
 This all leads me to "Sin City"


 This movie is amazing


 You either love it or you hate it, I guess

 I loved it
 It combines film noir with a very comic book feel, and extremely true to the original Frank Miller graphic novels
 A great cast in a very well filmed and written movie

 Robert Rodriguez is amazing, and his talents are put to the test here


 The recut, extended, unrated DVD is also amazing


 I'm not going to admit that I (cough) pirate movies, but my normal DVD attitude is "why buy the cow..."  Well folks, this is a cow worth buying

 If you loved the movie, you'll love the DVD

 It has too many extras to name them all, but they're all worth it


 You get to see all 4 stories as they were originally meant to be AND the way it was released in theatres AND in a green screen version that lets you see what was real and what was CGI AND with an optional audio track from the premiere audience that saw this movie...not to mention tons of interviews with cast and crew


 This is the reason to buy a DVD!

$REVIEW.: College Inc. is a subjective look into the seedier side of the for profit college system. Both the defenders and its critics are interviewed about the merits of the for-profit educational system and, in the end, the viewer can make up their own mind about the subject. But the evidence clearly shows that for-profits have very little value; is unaccredited, which means these credits don't transfer to state colleges; has a poor quality education and often times costs far more to attend these colleges than it does a state college and a community college; and the quality of the education is often times very questionable. For instance, three nursing students Martha, Nora and Susan went to the for-profit Everest College. They never set foot in a hospital during their time there and their education mainly consisted of learning about The Church of Scientology's Evils of Psychiatry. Another sad case is of one Ann Cobb, a 35-year old divorced woman, who is knee deep in $60,000 in student loans and only makes $8,000 a year on food stamps. Even after graduating, she still hasn't been able to find a job and can't pay off her loans.Other problems with the for-profits are pressure tactics used by recruiters to get as many people to sign up. The more people they get to sign up the more money they make so they sign just about any person off of the street without discriminating whether this person is a worthwhile college student. I would recommend this film to any and all students who are thinking about going to a for-profit and urge them to reconsider it. If a students defaults on their loans, the federal government will hound them until it is all paid back and it can't be discharged in bankruptcy. The man who expanded the for-profit and made it what it is today, Michael Clifford, never went to college, has a past history of cocaine and marijuana abuse and converted to Christianity to show what a humanitarian he is. But I can see through the facade.

$REVIEW.: It is a mistake to fool old men into being confused what they are getting for their money.  This makes me feel really stupid.  I thought I was getting a movie presentation of a Shakespeare play.  I don't know what this thing is or is supposed to be.  If the people selling this thing wanted to be fair and honest they would advise the public, at least the stupid ones like me, this is a far cry from anything William Shakespeare ever imagined. I guess if you are young enough you don't mine seeing this thing transferred to the 20th century.  To enjoy this you had better be very young, and ignorant of what Elizabethan drama is.  I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE THE PRODUCERS OF THIS CRAP PRESENT A HOLYWOOD VERSION OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST.  I can see Jesus saying, "Hi you dudes, get over here and hear the word.  If you want to be cool, let some ass hit you and turn around so he can kick your ass, then you will be like on ecstacy."  I appologize, I don't know the proper youthful phraseology.If Amazon was to allow really honest reviews we should be able to offer ones with no stars.  Even the advertixing for this disk is misleading.  I found it listed with Hemlet, The Taming of the Shrew, The Merchant of Venice, Othello, etc.  No warning is given unless you read the reviews already given, the one star reviews, and I fear what the other disks I ordered are going to be like.  If you are in school, say grades K-3, you have no sense of fine literature, you are intellectually undevelopedm your idea of good television is Sponge Bob, and you can't read, you might enjoy this and your parents might feel justified in wasting this much money on this worthless piece of junk.I hope I have not been too generous in my review of the quality of this production.  Buy it at your own risk.  If you value your emotional and mental stability, don't open the package but dispose of it in a "hazardous material" disposal unit.  To put it bluntly, THIS THING SUCKS!!!!

$review_text.: This is a solid, if not particularly mesmerizing, mystery from France's master of suspense.THE COLOR OF LIES has elements of several of Chabrol's earlier films: a seaside village (THIS MAN MUST DIE), a murderered child (LE BOUCHER), haunting psychological/sociopathological attachments (CRY OF THE OWL), a morally vacuous and predatory televison personality (MASQUES). Though COLOR OF LIES has an outstanding cast the film is almost too subdued for its own good and so viewers will likely find themselves recalling those other (and, in some ways, much better) Chabrol films.THE COLOR OF LIES is competent but it has the feel of a mystery produced for public television. Despite the presence of some major stars (Sandrine Bonnaire, Valerie Bruni Tedeschi) it simply lacks the excitement one expects from a feature film. There are, however, some things worth noting and that for some viewers might make it worth your while.The two leads, the painter/art teacher and his massage therapist wife are, as other reviewers have noted, strangely subdued. The painter is very passionate about his art but he has not achieved much success and so its a frustrated passion and one that is directed inward. This character with his Van Gogh haircut and mannerisms and his limp is almost painful to look at. And his wife (played by the earthy but ethereal Bonnaire) cannot seems to decide whether she still believes in him or whether she is on the verge of giving up on him and looking elsewhere for passion. She is more interesting when alone but these two do not have what you would describe as a charismatic or dynamic relationship and so its not that alluring to watch them together. It seems that they are at the point in their relationship when the love has cooled and they are simply struggling to survive some hard times which are made even more difficult when the painter is accused of raping and murdering one of his young female art students. Their apparent lack of emotionality and responsiveness to each other does not help things.But then every character in this film could be described as "subdued".To be fair I think the character's subdued response to each other's nasty habits ( murder, betrayal, and obsessive-compulsive lying) are what make the film interesting. This is one of those mysteries where the actual solution to the crime(s)is not necessarily the climax of the film; rather its the little revelations along the way that make this worth sticking with until the end. It's as if every character in this seaside community has at least one nasty secret or is involved in some illegal or compromising practice and that all of these secrets and practices are in some way linked and so any crime within the community implicates everyone in some way. The sense of crime and collaboration are actually what make up "community" and "relationship" in a Chabrol film.Also there are no minor characters in this film, or, perhaps I should say that the minor characters are the most interesting. The visiting inspector Frederique Lesage (played by the female lead of Ozon's 5X2, Valerie Bruni Tedeschi) is a coldly professional careerist intent on solving the crime(s). She seems incapable of human attachments (she allows her own daughter to be cared for by a known prostitute and her boyfriend, a suspect in several robberies) and her only connection to others is strictly on an interview basis; thus the detective compares and contrasts well with the other "minor" character, Desmot, who is a television interviewer/print journalist who seems strangley remote and alientated from humanity. It is as if everyone in this comunity is weary of life because everyone knows a little too much about it.  At the same time there is at least one surprise (it wouldn't be Chabrol if there weren't) that is arguably worth the wait. Some viewers might think its too little too late to save this sleepy seaside drama but if you are a Chabrol fan or a fan of quirky offbeat mysteries that aren't afraid to unfold at their own elegant pace then you might take the risk.

$REVIEW.: Bryan Singer was supposed to be such a great fan of Superman that he gave up being the kingpin of the X-Men series for the chance to direct a  Superman movie.  Maybe his abilities didn't match his enthusiasm.It's true that Christopher Reeve can never be replaced.  But was Brandon Routh really the best actor Singer could find for the title character?  Routh is a decent enough actor, I suppose, and he handled the physical stunt part of the role pretty well.  But I never felt he was SUPERMAN.  Christopher Reeve had the look, the intensity, the attitude, the PRESENCE, and the CHARISMA to burst off the screen and make you BELIEVE in Superman.  Routh's face rarely changes expression.  He's so quiet, gloomy, and flat that he makes Superman seem like a secondary character in his own movie.Singer didn't serve Routh very well with that re-designed costume.  I don't mind the muted colors; they make the suit seem a little less comic-booky.  But those low-rise tiny red "briefs" and the high, tight collar make the proportions of the costume look weird and unbalanced.A few random thoughts, and sorry if I repeat anything in the 430+ reviews that came before this one, since I could only read the last few.  In the farm flashback, why is the young Clark Kent wearing glasses?  The first movie showed that he was super the first moment he reached earth.  How did Supie stretch out the trip to Krypton to **5 YEARS**???  (Of course, it had to be 5 years for the kid to be the right age when he got back.)  What did he expect to find?  It's a given in Superman lore that Krypton exploded into pieces.  What was there? Where did he find the Kryptonian ship he returned to earth in--and why did he need it?  If he had found the remains of Krypton, wouldn't it all be Kryptonite now, and do him in?  And HOW could Superman abandon earth and his "never-ending battle" without a word to anyone except his mother to go off on some ridiculous personal quest for 5 years?The explanation that Luthor got out of prison because Superman didn't show up to be a witness when his case was appealed is silly.  Appellate courts only review the records of lower courts for legal errors; they don't hear witnesses or take testimony.The flying and rescue effects are great, as you expect in 2006.  But guess what--after almost 30 years, the special effects in Superman 1 hold up surprisingly well.Finally, Singer said that he intended this movie to be a sequel to Superman 2.  But the presence of the kid (a monumental change in the Superman world) makes that hard to see.  In the original release of Superman 2 (the Lester version), Superman gave up his powers before he and Lois made love.  So why is the boy showing signs of becoming super?  And then later in the Lester version, Clark/Superman gave Lois the "amnesia kiss," so she'd forget about their brief affair.  I'll bet she was surprised when she discovered she was pregnant!  She must have spent a lot of time wondering how it happened!  So in "Superman Returns," how does she know Supie is the father??  And if she knows THAT, why doesn't she also remember the other thing she learned in Superman 2--that Superman is Clark Kent?  Pretty selective, Singer!On the other hand, if you consider the just-released Richard Donner Director's cut of Superman 2 (which, to be fair, we can't expect Singer to have conformed to), Superman turned back time, as he did in Superman 1, so that the whole movie never happened.  That means Supie and Lois never made love.  So where did the kid come from?These problems make "Superman Returns" a poor sequel to Superman 2, and a much weaker film than it could have been.  But I still gave it 3 stars because we can put the nit-picking aside and enjoy the fun of watching Superman fly a crippled jetliner to a safe landing in a ball park, crash through a building to catch the Daily Planet's rooftop globe before it hit the ground, and fly smoothly and majestically through the sky.

$REVIEW.: This movie is about a haunted house which kidnaps trespassers and steals toys which end up in the yard. One day, the neighbor boy across the street and his friend (the loveable, portly Chowder) decide that they are going to do something about this Monster House (after all, the responsible grownups and police officers know nothing of this).Along the way, a neighborhood girl gets involved, and the story picks up in intensity. There are some truly humorous moments of dialogue, and toward the end of the film, you discover the mystery and the secret behind this Monster House.The movie was mildly entertaining, and most kids will like it without getting overly frightened.I should also say that the animation in this movie was absolutely stunning. The way things are going, you wonder if there will be a need for more actors and actresses in the future, because the animation is getting more and more realistic.

$review_text.: On their way out of Texas, leaving a deadly-crime spree in their wake, two brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) scoop up an unsuspecting family (led by Harvey Keitel) and make their way across the border into Mexico. Home-free and troubles be damned, they party it up at a local strip joint that is open from dusk till dawn. In the morning, they will receive a generous pay-day, but in the meantime, must fend off a gang of deadly and sometimes seductive vampires."From Dusk Till Dawn" is a film about vampires, but you tend to forget about that in the first hour, as Tarantino's script focuses sharply on its characters. You'll feel like you're at the table with them as they share shots of whiskey, and when the excrement hits the fan, you're thrown off-balance by the complete 180 the film pulls. Now, depending on your expectations, the third act both ups the ante and makes the film, or it totally shatters the well-developed plot. If you love gore galore (hint: Robert Kurtzman, who provided special effects for the film, also conjured up the original story), this is your film. If anyone knows how to shoot a "shoot 'em up" flick, it's Robert Rodriguez, and he effortlessly transitions from character moments to over-the-top blood and guts and guns (check out Tom Savini's legendary cod-piece) at the turn of a dime. Truly professional film-making is what we have here.Despite the fact that the film switches it up on you just as you settle in, the end results are so much fun that it's forgivable. If you can't enjoy vampires being jack-hammered with a giant wooden-stake, then this certainly isn't the movie for you. The film is whip-smart, at times hilarious and at others, sincere. It's also got a solid cast worth noting. George Clooney plays against type, and likewise, Tarantino is less annoying than he is in his other acting roles. Harvey Keitel more or less steals the show at times, as the most professional and likable of the bunch, but you'll get a kick, no doubt, in seeing Cheech Marin playing three, count 'em, three roles in the film. "From Dusk Till Dawn" is essentially a brilliant mash-up of Tarantino's unique story-telling and characters and Robert Rodriguez's signature action and effects sequences, most certainly foreshadowing the duo's epic collaboration, "Grindhouse," a decade later. Those expecting anything but a good time will be sorely left in the cold.
$SUMMARY.: Pure fun 'till the break of dawn!

A hit man hides out in a small village and is mistaken for a baker, so he assumes the role.He enjoys his new profession, but is soon revealed for what he is, whereupon the villagers approach him to kill other fellow villagers. Meanwhile, another hit man is hot on his trail. The making out scene between the baker and the love interest will either disgust you or will have you laughing in stitches.

$review_text.: The Savage Curtain is a worthy episode of Star Trek.  Don't let Abraham Lincoln's absurd way of revealing himself turn you off from this episode.  I wish Lincoln had been introduced in another way.  Because of this, I took off a star.  However, once Lincoln came aboard the Enterprise, the story unfolded itself in an excellent way.This episode is so pivotal because it introduced so many important characters.  Kahless the Unforgettable and Surak both explained important parts of Klingon and Vulcan history respectively.  Most people do not realize that Season Three provided a lot of information on the History of Vulcan (sadly destroyed in Star Trek XI).  It was in Let That Be Your Last Battlefield that we learned Vulcan almost destroyed itself until logic was adopted.

$review_text.: Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning Western turns the genre entirely on its head. This west is a bleak moral vacuum, a place of anxious sized-obsessed men and violently determined women, where the creed of the cowboy gives way to the creed of the gangster. Villains aren't challenged to duels of skill, but slaughtered as they try to surrender. Virtually every man dies unarmed. The film could be enjoyed on a purely visceral level, but with its subplot about English Bob and his travelling 'biographer', screenwriter David Webb Peoples clearly has more in mind. His screenplay reflects on the Western as a myth-making genre, and suggests that the mythic conception of the American west is a fabrication woven from the exaggerated stories of braggarts and liars. His tale of Will Munny tells it like it probably was. It's a chilling world which has more in common with classical tragedy and the moral speculation of sci-fi. It's a world in which nobody wins, "we've all got it coming", and no one is forgiven.

However, she is actually very timid when it matters so she tries to pick the most harmless guy she can find to be her first.

Not only does the movie not make any attempt to provide a concise trip through its material, but it provides it in such broken fashion that you never know where it is going or why.  Also, a large amount of the 75 minutes are nothing but unrelated pictures and music.  Seriously, the narrator will take a pause while blurry images of old lamps are shown and rock music played... then more nonsense rambling.... then more pointless, unrelated pictures of household items with piano music...Philip majorly failed here.  Did he have something to say?  Who the heck knows.  There certainly are not any hidden messages or subtext either.  This is either a blatant attempt to make money from previously satisfied customers or evidence that Philip's opinion of his own work is not in alignment with his actual skills.  I personally believe he needs to check his compasses.

The main promise was pretty good, but it was worked horribly.  This film has horrible actors, NO special effects, and Is just a horrible excuss of a horror movie.  And there is so much nudity and sex, that if I ran a video store i would have put this film in the adult section. NOT THE HORROR. DON'T BUY, DON'T RENT, DON'T PAY-PER-VIEW, Watch when (or if because if you cut out the nudity the film would be half an hour long) it comes on TV.

$REVIEW.: *** This comment may contain spoilers ***"Ma Mere" 2004) directed by Christophe Honor&eacute; stars the wonderful, brave, one of the finest French actresses Isabelle Huppert as Helene a woman who spends one summer at the Canary Island and whose husband has suddenly died in the car crash while on his way back to France, to his mistress. Helen is left with her 16 (or 17) years old son Pierre (Louis Garrel, Bertolucci's "The Dreamers"). Pierre was brought up by his grandmother and came from the catholic school to spend his summer vacation with his parents who are more of the strangers to him. Here comes the first of many questions I had while watching this movie. If Pierre does not know very well his parents why he hates his father so much and is so attracted to his mother? We clearly see that Helen did not love her husband and had cheated on him and not just cheated but had spent most of her afternoons partying with her girlfriend - lover Rea engaging on all kinds of sexual acts. I wanted to add "perverted" but the director tells us through one of the most sympathetic characters in the movie that he does not believe in perversion so, I guess we should take all the events and the relationships as normal. I think that the writer/director is not interested very much in giving us any motivations, justifications and insights in the characters' minds and souls and that's why many scenes are laughable, awkward, embarrassing and boring, in spite the nudity, sex, and violence for which the movie received its very well deserved NC-17 rating. Do you want some examples? Here we go. Poor Pierre, odd and lonely, torn between his catholic upbringing and his unhealthy obsession with his mother, runs in the sands, fells on his knees, looks at the sky with anger and asks (God, I assume), "Why do mothers always want their sons to be Gods"? Later in the same scene, an old woman appears and Pierre asks her if she wants to be Mary, mother of God. . There is also a nice scene at the father's studio. After her husband is killed in the accident, Helen gives to Pierre the keys from his father's studio. Pierre finds porno magazines (lots of them), throws them on the carpet, throws himself on the magazines making love to them and then he urinates at the magazines and everything else within his reach in the room. Then things become even more interesting. Pierre, his mom, and her friend Rea are in a cab going to a night club. Rea and Helen kiss and hug, then Helen fondles Rea's breasts while Rea promises to Pierre that her first kiss would be in his "filthy bottom" and she actually checks if it is filthy or not ....while Helen watches in amusement. Another night, Helene and Rea abandon Pierre and find him later, passed out in the street. Rea undresses him and has sex with him as the tourists pass by...while his mother watches. Back at the villa, Pierre takes part in an orgy with his mother, Rea, and Hansi (de Caunes), another friend of Helene's, a young and pretty blonde girl. It seems to me that anywhere in the world, Helen would be pronounced an unfit mother and the boy would be taken from her - not in this movie. Well, Helen feels that she gets too attached to her son and too interested in his sex education and she and Rea go away, leaving Pierre in Hansi's care. Hansi introduces Pierre to the world of S&M; and tells him that his mother wanted him to do everything that she herself had done with Hansi and her many young friends...At one point, Helen realizes that she has lost her lust for life which for her means that she does not enjoy the sexual orgies anymore. She returns back and then two weirdest scenes follow which I won't reveal...and then the final credits accompanied by the Turtles' "Happy Together". You got the picture.More than anything this movie reminds me an old joke that I recalled during the scene on the beach where naked Pierre is daydreaming and Helen in a white dress appears like a dream and whispers in his ear "The desire reduces us to weakness" or something like that. Here is the joke. A man comes to the talent agency and says that he's got a great act. When asked what it is he goes, "Just imagine a huge theater with the audience all dressed up, the men in tuxedos, the ladies in the gowns, and there is a huge balloon hanging on the top of the ceiling. The balloon is filled with excrement. The music plays the lights are on...and then suddenly the lights are off, the music stops and I shoot the balloon from behind the curtains. The lights are on again, the music plays, the audience is all covered with crap and here I am on the stage - wearing a white tuxedo." My guess is that Christophe Honor&eacute; has told us this old joke and he is the one wearing the white tuxedo while the rest of the world including everyone involved in "Ma Mere" are covered with...well, excrement. Or like one of my friends said, maybe "Ma Mere" is a timeless masterpiece and I simply did not get it.

$review_text.: but I love the show and well the pricing makes the packaging bearable. The box comes with two plastic spindles which hold the dvds, so six seasons share one season and five the other spindle. while this is a great space saver. I do not understand why the spindles are so cheap why not make the tray/spindle a hard plastic? and the slip cover is ok, but not as sturdy as it should be.now onto the show itself. I lost track of the series during the last few seasons. I did not realize it was on for 11 seasons. and even though fox was screwing around with the schedule I had seen more of these episodes than I thought I did. But watching them straight through and seeing the evolution of the characters worked out great. there are a few featurettes that have interviews with the cast as well as easter eggs that have additional unaired clips from a reunion special. and there is an episode from the third season that wasn't aired (or so it says, but I swear I've seen it before...and in hindsight I wonder why it wasn't shown originally as they had done far more controversial episodes throughout their run.One thing I did notice (which is the beauty of watching a show season by season...as you can see things you missed when they first aired) is that the show never really jumped the shark, as it pretty much was an over the top production to begin with. the show seemed to relish in its absurdities. There were times when a character fell off the roof and it was obvious it was a dummy, and someone would say, ok we can see that's not a real person, well those people didn't get the joke. the writers invited us into their twisted little world. and they let us in on the jokes, so in some ways the show was a satire of all other family based sitcoms, and on the other hand it was a very unique take on the family sitcom.  The cast was perfect, the writing was spot-on and no matter how absurd it got, you couldn't help but laugh. It never took itself too seriously and it never tried to be something it wasn't. this was blue collar tv, before Rosanne (though many give that show credit for being the one that started the trend, even though Married with Children did it first....and best).Perhaps fueled by the controversy that surrounded it, the show became rather iconic even if it never was a number one show (fox was just starting out after all). But, I had never heard of a show that had such strong word of mouth and was as identifiable without being a Nielsen powerhouse. Well, not until this show turned up, same as with The Simpsons, everyone knew of the Simpsons and the catchphrases without it being  a number one show either. My favorite part is how when the show started you find Bud playing a believable son to fictional Al (who was a bit of a caricature unto himself, perhaps a character no one else could have played but Ed O'neil) and you kind of saw him as a &#34;bundy&#34; and you saw Kelly as what Al could never be (popular, loved and happy) so when the show progressed and it was Kelly who became more like Al, you kind of find it more believable when Al says what his life could have been. The young and beautiful Kelly seemed to have a promising life ahead of her, but in the end you find that life can shatter even the most promising of dreams. She was more like Al than you would have thought. He was popular in high school too. now...he's married with Children.Katy Segal plays Peggy perfectly. You can see why Al can both love her and be frustrated with her at the same time. Though you really can't understand why he wouldn't want to go to bed with her. as she is a beautiful woman, perhaps too extreme at times. There were times when the writers made her rather unlikable. I guess it helped the story along, but at the same time it made you wonder why Al would have put up with her for so long.though the details can be rather inconsistent, I don't think it matters, or that they care. Obviously they could not have done anything they did or have what they had if he really didn't make any money as a shoe salesman, and at times the over-exaggeration can be a bit trying, but they somehow managed to make you forget all of that with some great lines. Though I found Peggy wasn't given as many great lines as Al. maybe they needed more female writers I am not sure. But overall the show was great and highly rewatchable.One last thought, since this show got a lot of bad press about it's dysfunctionaltiy I would like to say that with this show, no matter how over the top they got, no matter how mean they would be to each other at times, when it really got down to it they loved each other. and they always had each other's back. While they might harass each other without a second thought no one else could. They had each other's back. that's something you don't really see in most family oriented shows, or they were more talk than action. In Married with Children you got the sense that even though they seemed like they hated each other when it came right down to it they actually cared about each other. You get the feeling too that the cast got along in real life as well, as the chemistry is strong, and though the supporting characters may seem to despise the bundys you feel as if the actors respected each other. and in the end, I believe that if a show is to be successful you not only need talented actors but you need them to have the right chemistry together. The actors all seem to respect and care for each other (you can see this more when you watch the featurettes) and that comes across In the show, and that's why it's not hard to like this rather strange but relatable family

$review_text.: DC Comics' Vertigo imprint joins the comic book to film frenzy with Constantine, based on the rich anti-hero John Constantine from the comic book Hellblazer

In the comic, Constantine is a foul-mouthed, beer swilling, two pack a day smoking, dirt bag of a blonde Brit


In the movie, he's Keanu Reeves
Why the producers behind this film would select a none-to-well known character like John Constantine, and then proceed to virtually dump all pre-existing character information about him, is beyond me
In my mind, you pick an established character for either the name recognition (capitalizing on a built in audience) or because that character is such a great one (in which you keep very close to the source material)
Constantine chooses to eschew both these alternatives and instead goes for the dubious `let's totally change a character that nobody knows just to piss off the ones that do know' approach

And they do so successfully
While my unwitting cohorts were dazzled enough by the now expected veneer of special effects and thrown together artifact-related plot to at least not hate it, I found myself stupidly wondering at the terrible loss of potential.Tilda Swinton is great fun to watch as the archangel Gabriel, and Peter Stormare does his best to deliver some pretty bad material as Satan

Otherwise, the cast is flat and unmotivated
The plot circles around a special dagger that can somehow unleash the son of Satan into the world that otherwise only allows half demons and half angels
Needless to say, Constantine saves the day, and indirectly, himself from eternal damnation

If you are a fan of the comic, do not see this adaptation under any circumstance


If you are not a fan, then there's really no reason to see it unless you just really like Keanu Reeves
With these people running things, look for Sandman, the Romantic Comedy starring Rosie O'Donnel as Death


Oh, those silly Endless.

$REVIEW.: WILD ORCHID was released in 1990 surrounded by controversy that the sex scenes between Carre Otis and Mickey Rourke were not faked.  They were a couple at the time, and it is possible that there is some truth to the rumor, but in the end does it matter?It's a typical Zalman King affair -- rather thin plot revolving around some business intrigue and mostly a sexual awakening of a girl from the country traveling to Rio.  The setting provides incredible material for the brilliant cinematography, and the music is sexy and moody.  A very fun role for Jacqueline Bisset, but unfortunately too little for anyone else to do other than pose and preen ... and ... well... do love scenes.  Zalman King movies are soft and sensuous, and revolve around mood and sex scenes.  Don't expect anything more than well-photgraphed love scenes, and you will be fine.To all you DVD geeks out there (like me) -- edge enhancemnet is at an all-time high here.  Colors are good, and its nice to see this movie in widescreen format.  You get both the R-rated version and the unrated versions, but this is done on sides of the disc and not by branching.  You get a 2 channel stereo mix that is not very good, but probably the original soundtrack without any remastering (pity because this one needs the extra ooomph in the sound department).  Grain and print flaws are obvious, the film shows its age in the transfer.  But at the low retail price fans of the movie will like it, but certainly not a demo disc by any means.

$REVIEW.: Cookie's Fortune is about a murder, the investigation that ensues and the long covert secrets that are revealed. The setting is Mississippi, where everybody knows everybody else, and more often then not, everybody is everybody else's cousin. It's the same place where Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe once hunted down some inbred racist good ol' boys and the ku kux klan in Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning. Even if a black man is taken in for the murder of his white landlady/friend/confidant (or is she?), Altman's peculiar little slice of some very distinct lives is as far away as you can get from that sensationalist film. For starters, the old lady, Cookie Orcutt (Patricia Neal) has, quiet happily, committed suicide to join her departed husband. There has been no murder. The "investigation" involves friendly chats with the local witnesses where the police clerk, a cute wide eyed young woman ponders complex questions in the vein of "How can I strike Eddie's statement from the record. I'm recording this, not writing it". Meanwhile, the "suspect", the immensely amiable Willis (Charles Dutton) sits in an open cell, playing scrabble with the police chief Lester Boyle, who believes Willis to be innocent because he has "fished with him". The suspect's stay is so relaxed that he complains that he may die from the lavish prison food, incidentally cooked by the Police chief's wife, before he gets anywhere near an electric chair.In an Altman film, the setting is almost as important as his numerous characters. In this case, it is Holly Springs, with its staples and archetypes. The camera wonders around town, lazily observing them, slowly revealing the plot, which is obvious and serves only to highlight those archetypes. The story, which, despite a couple of twists near the end is just an excuse to observe this inbred, particular architecture of inter-locking relationships. There is Camille (Glen Close), Cookie's niece who discovers Cookie's body and eats the suicide note because "no one commits suicide in this family". This is her contribution to the plot, more important to Altman is the fact that she is a pompous, elitist eccentric who is currently directing a "revised" Oscar Wilde's version of Salome for which she shares a writing credit. Her sister, a ravishing moron, Cora(Julianne Moore)is the star who could hypnotize a bull in heat with her "performance". Cora's daughter is Emma (Liv Tyler), a free spirit who rejects her family, and is in love with a local doofus cop, Jason Brown (Chris O'Donnell) who in turn is acting her deranged aunt's play. And so goes the circle.The town of course is comically under prepared for a murder investigation. Much of the humor comes from the way these people's child-like reactions to what other more cynical movie characters would react with requisite formality. In truth the film is difficult to classify. Partly a comedy of manners or a gentle farce or a tour of a deep fried utopia even a tale of one man's camaraderie with his town. It has a lightness of touch, that would make those frenzied, desperate young directors jealous. After the useless, Grishamed, plot-driven Gingerbread Man, I think the best classification for this little gem would simply be "A Robert Altman film".

$review_text.: Gary Cooper stars in this intense Western as a former outlaw, now reformed, who finds himself trapped by circumstances with his former gang.  Cooper is on a train that is held up by the gang, and left behind, he, Julie London, and Arthur O'Connell meet up with the gang and witness firsthand their brutality and violence.  The gang is headed by Cooper's uncle, Lee J. Cobb, who is pleased to see Cooper return.  He's planning a big bank heist, the heist to end all heists, and wants Cooper to be a part of it like old times.  Of course, Cooper must find a way out.The tension in the film never lets up, as the threat of violence hangs in every scene.  Cooper is fine in one of his last performances, portraying a man who has tried hard to overcome his past, finding himself in a situation where he must literally fight for his survival.  London also does well as the saloon singer finally experiencing love, giving a quietly moving performance.  Cobb is explosive as usual, helping to give the film some of its tension and edge.Man Of The West is well photographed in colour, with empty spaces looming everywhere in the backdrop of the struggle.  Director Anthony Mann keeps everything simple, if not elemental, not shying away from portraying the brutality of the characters and the situation.  Other than an obviously "stagey" fight between Cooper and one of the gang (lots of easy to spot fake punches), there is a dark realism throughout the movie.Man Of The West may not be a very well known Western, but it deserves to be seen.

$REVIEW.: During his State of the Union address in 1961 President John F


Kennedy challenged the nation, "before this decade is out, to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to the Earth." Despite all the turbulence of the 1960s (Vietnam, three assassinations, the civil rights movement, etc.), on July 20, 1969 Neil Armstrong stepped off his lunar module ladder and onto the moon --240,000 miles away--with the unforgettable words, "that's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." This remarkable documentary covers much but not all of the Apollo program, which ran from 1961 to 1975 and in six missions landed twelve people on the moon (the last in 1972 with Apollo 17)
It focuses especially on the first lunar landing with Apollo 11, and the catastrophe of Apollo 1 and near-catastrophe of Apollo 13

In addition to the sheer magnitude of the scientific and technical feat, the film captures the deeply human drama, the truly global celebration, and even the spiritual impact that the lunar landings had on the astronauts

The film draws heavily upon NASA archival film footage, much of which has never been seen before, and reflections by all of the surviving astronauts, save the reclusive Neil Armstrong

This might be the best documentary film of 2007.

$REVIEW.: Poignant story of a lost little boy trying to find his Father at a busy Brazilian train station

Although not a perfect film, the characters portrayed give such honest performances that you do tend to overlook the  implausibilties of the narrative

For example, why would a crusty and jaded  old woman travel across the country for a boy she hardly knows? Still,  'Central Station' seems to be a film that plays from the heart and to it's  credit, the schmaltz factor isn't over-played (at least not as much as it  could have been)

Fernanda Montenegro wins you over slowly as Dora while  the little boy Josua (Vin&iacute;cius de Oliveira) is so stubborn and determined  that you can't help but want him to find his Father


Oh, plus there's  gorgeous scenery, too
Just don't expect 'Central Station' to be a glossy  Hollywood tear-jerker.

The storyline embraces issues of faith and courage of conviction.Directed by Otto Preminger, John Huston plays a supporting role that nominated him for best supporting actor.Interestingly, Carol Lynley plays a duel role and Robert Morse (How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying) sings. Other notables include Burgess Meredith and Dorothy Gish.This DVD is powerful family entertainment and definitely worth the price.

$review_text.: I was really surprised at how good that this is


I already ownedHoliday Greetings From The Ed Sullivan Showand was pretty disappointed in it
However, this release blows that one out of the water


Unlike the other release, which is a staged tribute to the show that is only about one third devoted to original clips (all of which are heavily abridged), "Classic Christmas" is made up basically entirely of original clips of the show

Each clip also is run nearly entirely (I would imagine that there is some rather superficial cutting done after the appearances are concluded) and there are some really great appearances, including Christmas songs by artists like Brook Benton and Connie Francis and several skits by the early Muppets.Really, really great stuff that certainly for me evoked the Christmas spirit, and actually it makes me wish that we had a show like this one again--could it work? There is such a fascination with live performing these days, seems like maybe somebody would give a new variety show a shot.

$REVIEW.: Gary Cooper was 40 years old when he made &quot;Sergeant York,&quot; and his Southern accent is weak at best, but those things do not end up detracting all that much from his performance or this film.  Directed in 1941 by Howard Hawks, &quot;Sergeant York&quot; has strong propagandistic elements.  A whiskey-drinking hell-raiser, Alvin C. York undergoes a religious conversation when lighting strikes his gun and almost kills him.  His goal in life becomes getting himself a piece of bottom land so he can propose to Gracie Williams (Joan Leslie).  Things go against him, but Alvin holds his temper and does what the Good Book tell him to do.  Then World War I breaks out and Alvin is drafted.  Unable to get status as a conscientious objector because of his religious beliefs, Alvin has to come to terms with the obligations of citizenship versus the dictates of scripture.  The film is surprisingly even handed in showing Alvin debating the matter with his superiors.  In the end he comes to the only conclusion possible for men of conscience forced to go to war: killing is justified to save lives.On the Argonne Forest battlefield Alvin, made a corporal because of his marksmanship, becomes a hero when his unit is trapped and he single-handedly kills 25 and captures 132 prisoners.  Called the &quot;greatest civilian solider of the war&quot; by General Pershing, York received the Medal of Honor, France's Croix de Guerre, and basically every high medal the Allies could bestow upon him.  But while the film does a first-rate job of showing York's heroic exploits, ultimately it is more about the man that the solider.  Cooper's sense of dignity is well-suited to the role, which gives more weight to York's life in the hills of Tennessee than to the war in Europe.  What he learned back home clearly stands Alvin in good stead on the battlefield.The supporting cast of &quot;Sergeant York&quot; is truly outstanding, with George Tobias as &quot;Pusher&quot; Ross, Ward Bond as Ike Botkin and Robert Porterfield as Zeb Andrews.  Both Walter Brennan as Pastor Rosier Pile and Margaret Wycherly as Mother York received well deserved Oscar nominations in the supporting category.  Brennan marvelously underplays his role as Alvin's spiritual leader while Wycherly is simply the anchor for the entire film.  Mother York says little and moves slowly, but everything comes out through her eyes.  The scene where Alvin finally gets home from the war and sees his mother at the train station is especially touching: his face lights up completely and her &quot;I'm right glad to see you, son&quot; is the equivalent of other people crying and screaming for joy.  In addition to Cooper winning his first Oscar as Best Actor, William Holmes receives one for Film Editing.  This is one of those movies I never get tired of seeing and it remains the ideal film to watch on Memorial Day.

$REVIEW.: Time has perhaps taken a tiny tick off the perfection of this for me(the ending is a bit abrupt, etc.), but this is still one of the best,most beautiful, most emotional, and most entertaining 'family' filmsever made.Eschewing dialogue entirely for large blocks of time, and then onlyusing words sparingly when people do speak, this is story told inpictures, both breathtaking wide shots (often tracking shots moving sofast, but so smoothly that it seems impossible) and intimate close-upsrevealing subtle details of emotion.The sequence with boy and horse making friends while trapped on anisland is justifiably what people remember most, but there's lotsthat's great here, including what was arguably the best performance ofMickey Rooney's long career.NB: The DVD releases are frustrating
The US release isn't evenanamorphic, and the UK, while anamorphic, has lots of dirt, grain, andless than perfect moments

$REVIEW.: Before greed, free agency, outrageous player salaries, performance enhancing drugs, smaller ballparks, closers, pitch counts, five-man rotations, and the 2002 All-Star Game tie, there was a game called baseball where stadiums generally were much bigger than today's stadiums (with a few exceptions), pitchers took the mound every fourth day, there were no pitch counts, no closers, no performance enhancing drugs, no free agency, no $250,000,000 contracts, and the All-Star Game never ended in a wimpy tie.  Yes, those were the good old days of baseball.  When It Was A Game shows, in color, baseball's golden past.  Color 8 mm and 16 mm home movie footage taken by fans and players between 1934 and 1957 is presented here.  In fact, this whole program is composed of this rare color footage.  You'll see footage of the 1938 World Series at Wrigley Field in color.  You'll see such legends as Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, Roy Campanella, Hank Aaron, Dizzy Dean, Joe Cronin, Bobby Doerr, and many others.  You'll see a lot of the old stadiums, such as Briggs Stadium in Detroit, Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, Crosley Field in Cincinnati, Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C., the Polo Grounds in New York, and many others.Watch baseball during its golden age.  Watch this DVD.  Not only does it show how baseball was in those days, it also shows how the U.S. was in those days.

$REVIEW.: The Black Sleep, 1956 filmThe voice tells of a drug that induces a sleep like death. It was known thousands of years ago. We see Newgate Prison in 1872 London. Dr. Angus Ramsey has a visitor the night before he is to hang for murder (convicted on circumstantial evidence). It was self-defense, he says. His dissection after death was stayed; he will get a Christian burial. An East Indian drug will sedate him. The next morning they find Ramsey's body in his cell. "Dead for two hours." The body is brought to its destination. An injection brings him back from suspended animation! He reads his death certificate! Udo will provide for a burial. At Dr. Gordon's  home Mungo creates a shocking surprise! He only obeys Daphne. Can the young woman Angelina be cured from a deep-seated tumor? She is Dr. Gordon's wife. Mungo is the former Dr. Munroe until he developed a brain condition. Dr. Gordon plans a complex brain operation after he gained experience.There is a secret room behind the fireplace. It was built in the Dark Ages for protection against Viking invasions in the 8th century. Dr. Gordon will do a brain operation. We see the details. The technical terms relate to the brain. Medical science is the reason for research. Later Mungo attacks Dr. Ramsey! "Don't wander in the hall at night." Lorrie wants help for Mungo, her close relative. Lorrie tells about an operation that cured Mungo of left-side paralysis but affected his personality. Udo comes from London to tell about a possible acquisition. A young woman visits Udo and is offered a glass of wine. The police are looking for Miss Daley; she was a friend of Curry the moneylender (who was supposedly murdered by Dr. Ramsey). Dr. Ramsey talks to Lorrie about the patient records. He confides to Lorrie. They go to the surgery and find a stranger who lives in the past. There are others (for shock value). There is a conflict between Ramsey and Gordon over these prisoners. A madman with an obsession? Gordon needs Ramsey's help, he shows him Angelina and explains why he experiments to find a cure for her.The new test subject has suffered a relapse, she's dead. Dr. Gordon decides to use Lorrie as the test replacement. But the police have arrived to search for Miss Daley, who disappeared after visiting Udo. The prisoners are freed, they attack Daphne! "Kill, kill!" Dr. Gordon makes a misstep when escaping. The police arrive to take Udo away. Dr. Ramsey walks outside with Lorrie. A happy ending for them?This is an example of a movie that would have been inproved with a better story. Lon Chaney and Bela Lugosi were near the end of their careers. [I suspect this is a very subtle message movie against the practice of lobotomy, where the brain is damaged in the hope of a cure.]

$review_text.: I have been a Tenchi Muyo! fan for a long time, so much so that I searched rigorously for the DVD copies when Genco was still a by-product of Pioneer and not of Universal Studios or Funimation! And needless to say for any hardcore Anime fan out there, I was not excited to hear about how Funimation bought out the English rights to Tenchi Muyo!, and the latest work clearly shows my worries.But luckily the dubbing here for all three movies were all done by the original cast from Pioneer! And although the sound in my opinion sounds pretty much standard in terms of 2.1 Stereo, (just could be my crappy RCA stereo though so take that part with a grain of salt), but the upscale quality of the Blu-Ray videos are very well done. I was very impressed, because usually Funimation does a really crappy job at that. Now even though you can still see some grain, its from the original artwork of the animation and not at all the result of bad pixilation. But never the less it looks good.Now I know they force the DVD's on some of you you and that on the other hand I think look's very pixilated! The original DVD's done by Genco and Pioneer were a lot better! I think what Funimation tried to do was upscale the DVD quality for more modern wide screen televisions, as opposed to the original squared 420p tube television that was actually intended for during the 90's. Honestly I think they should've left that part alone.Now the movie's themselves are a different matter, a matter in which I'll be very brief.Tenchi Muyo in Love! - Taking place after the events of the Tenchi Universe continuum, It is a story where an A1 class criminal escapes from a subspace prison and goes back in time to kill a woman by the name of Achika Musaki, Tenchi's mother. So Tenchi in the gang must go back in time to the 70's to stop him so that Tenchi can still be born.I think that these are the weakest of the movies only because it has some serious plot holes that they never address. Such as why Kane goes back in time in the first place. I won't give away any spoiler's but after you watch it and REALLY think about it. You start to see where I'm coming from. However, I'm actually surprised that they don't do any time period jokes about the funky age of the 70's like a lot of movies were doing at the time. Or maybe that's just an American thing.Tenchi Muyo! Daughter of Darkness - This movie is the only one that kind of stands on its own in terms of the timeline continuums. It's more that it shares attributed from pieces of the only two at the time (before Tenchi in Tokyo), as it shares the Light Hawk Wings from the OVA series, and Det. Kiyone from Tenchi Universe. Anyways, it's about how a demon of the Tree of Darkness, Yazuha, creates a genetic specimen from her silver hair and Tenchi's black hair. That essentially gives birth to Tenchi's daughter! This is actually both a very touching as well as very funny movie with a lot of action that is a lot better than the last. It shows a lot of strong character development, mostly in terms of Ryoko, but sadly it kind of doesn't mean anything as its not building from any of the series. But there is some light touching on possible incest and jailbait exploitation....you'll know what I mean after watching the movie. But besides those few uncomfortable minutes of footage, it's still worth a look-see.Tenchi Muyo in Love 2! (Tenchi Forever!) - This is an actual sequel from the first movie as well as the Tenchi Universe continuum. It's where Tenchi is abducted by a spirit of a Jurian Camellia tree named, Haruna. Although it does take a theme from the original OVA's in terms of the Jurian Royal Trees, it is still just Tenchi Universe related. Anyways, the gang spend an entire year looking for Tenchi where it ends up taking Ryoko and Ayeka to Tokyo (which makes sense because this was around the time Tenchi in Tokyo series came out and the animation clearly shows). Mean while, Tenchi finds himself married to this beautiful woman with porcelain skin named Haruna, but with absolutely no memories of his former life. There is very little action in this movie, but in my opinion is by far the best one out of all three movies! It's nice to see a company that actually gets better at making movies with each attempt. And not to mention, Tenchi finally gets lucky (from none of the other six girls), and there is some animated upper body nudity.Anyways, that's my two cents. Sorry about the length, and I hope you enjoy it!

$review_text.: This is worth buying if your a serious blondie fan. This video compilation includes the complete videos for Heart of Glass, The Tide is High, and Rapture. All the other videos were taken from the greatest hits video compilation. The Heart of Glass audio is in it's original mono version and the original Disco Version (unlike the remixed version on the greatest hits taken from the album version which had horrble audio editing), You won't find this video in this condition anywhere else. The tide is high video is the version they show in clubs featuring stills from the Eat to the Beat videos and a few scenes from the original video. Rapture is complete and the sound on all other videos is 5.1.

$review_text.: One of my all-time favorite musicals.  It never fails to please.  It has EVERYTHING!  Great songs, great dancing, great plot, great stars and Donald O'Connor's super "Make 'em Laugh" number that is one of the best ever done.  He should have won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar just for that number.  Debbie Reynolds was a "baby" in that movie.  She literally danced her feet bloody in the "Good Mornin'" number because Gene Kelly was so fussy about her dancing.  Jean Hagen is wonderful as Lena Lamont, the squeaky movie queen.  Everything about this film is perfect!  Buy it and enjoy!!!

$review_text.: The first couple of times I saw "Legend", I didn't really like it. The story felt sooo contrived, the acting by Tom Cruise and Mia Sara wasn't all that great....it seemed like a waste of excellent make-up and surrounding. The only things I really liked were: 1)The score by Tangerine Dream, which I thought was very mystical and enchanting, and 2) The preformance of Tim Curry, who shines as the Lord of Darkness, and to me is the best personification of the Devil/pure evil ever captured on film (except for the voice of Mercedes McCambridge in "The Exorcist, but you can't really see him, so that doesn't count).Then I heard about the new "Ultimate Edition" that just came out, and that the new Director's Cut featured on the first disc surpassed the U.S. release greatly. I got intensely curious, and thought I'd check it out and buy it. Well, it turns out the reviews were right; the Director's Cut IS better. The story isn't contrived at all now (since it adds on about twenty minutes)! And the score by Jerry Goldsmith, thought definitely not among his best work, is more along the line of traditional fairy tale scores...and best of all, it removes the stupid rock song at the end! JOY TO THAT!! Unfortuanately, the acting doesn'y improve much, but it does give the characters of Jack and Lily much more depth, and spent more time focussing on their love relationship (which helped the movie out A LOT). Overall, a vast improvement over the U.S. release.The Ultimate Edition DVD is verrrry nice, and includes an awesome case, as well. The making-of documentary is interesting enough, though it would've been really nice to see Tom Cruise in their, too. Also, before I saw the making-of docmentary, I felt the whole plot of Legend seemed too cliche...but since director Ridley Scott explains quite thoroughly that that's what he was going for (a traditional fairy tale story), I look at the movie much more  differently now. The menus are really cool. The lost scenes are fairly interesting, though one can see why they were taken out (especially the "Fairy Dance" sequence, which seemd to silly and stratched too far away from the story).Conclusion: A very worthy buy for fantasy fans, if only just to see the outstanding preformance of Tim Curry.

$review_text.: Read all the books and we are in accord, that the movie was nothing like the book. Tyson's persona was changed completely. Fine, we're being sensitive to &#34;special&#34; needs children, by changing the movie in such a fashion you robbed a crucial lesson Percy learned and that I exploited to no end with my children about it. How truly special these children can be and that they just as much heart and soul as they rest of us.Anyway-The rest of the movie: atrocious performance by the cast, it was bland and just thrown together. The look and feel of the movie seemed to have taken on aspects from HUNGER GAMES (that was terrible) which destroyed the crisp fresh and hip originality of the first movie. It was painful to watch, I felt like Polyphemus, I wanted to eat those demigods and the director.This movie should only cost 5.62.Mr. Director what were you thinking!!!

I have watched most of Reese's movies and i think she is a fine actress but this performance should have garnered her an academy award, she is mesmerizing, unforgettable and flat out fantastic in this her finest hour as an actress.

$REVIEW.: Not a comedy, rather a deeply moving story about a chamber maid with a gift for chess
It is the opposite of Johann Strauss's Stubenm&auml;dchen in Die Fledermaus, though I suspect that image was in the minds of the creators of this film

You don't need to know chess to enjoy this film, but if you have played in chess tournaments you will enjoy an extra dimension of recollection

$REVIEW.: Anyone who has attended public school in the last 20 years is quite familiar with the sort of anti-bullying films students are generally forced to watch: three or four teenagers in an arcade/public library/[insert location no modern teenager would ever go to here], wearing clothes that were in fashion for about 10 minutes in 1986, unsuccessfully attempt to suppress Canadian accents while a stiff narrator asks the audience what they would do in the situation. Ironically, the actors in these movies are possibly the most retroactively bullied teens of all time, as students are unable to resist mocking poorly-delivered chestnuts like, &#34;Give me your lunch money, eh.&#34;Contest isn't one of those movies. This is a well-acted, humorous, and thought-provoking film that manages to make its message apparent without sacrificing the story. Self-reliant Tommy is forced to collaborate with the intimidating Matt for a cooking contest, but the stakes go way beyond cuisine--Tommy is convinced that Matt has an ulterior motive, and he's not wrong. In fact, there are multiple layers to Matt's involvement, and double-crossing is the biggest dish on the menu. The duo's relationship evolves naturally, and not always in a positive direction, thanks to a combination of Matt's continued desire to impress his cronies and please his devious older brother, and Tommy's inability to fully trust his former tormentor. The ultimate outcome probably won't come as a surprise to viewers, but even towards the end of the film, there are enough twists and turns to keep things exciting.Of course, the mission of a movie like this is probably more about stemming discussion rather than merely trying to entertain. Fortunately, Contest manages to do both, especially since all teens should easily find traces of themselves in one or more characters. In a genre that often comes across as cheesy and forced, this is a rare movie that could actually make a real impact on its audience.

$REVIEW.: The Hurt Locker is not your normal "this is war" movie. It shows you an aspect of war you hear a lot about but you do not see that much of - bombs that get left by the wayside and the people that have to deal with them. In it, you get to look at three people and see a lot of the motivation that pushes them forward (and a 4th character briefly - although you don't really get to know him that much). This introduces you to the adrinaline ride some people have, the fear that fuels some of the motions, and the respect that soldiers seemed to have for these people. That was something I liked about this the most - the respect portion, and the part that shows you just how much these people have to watch out for.When we start our ride we are introduced to some of the mechanics that are used in this type of war, and we also see what the bombmakers work with. A robot pulling a small cart versus a 9 volt battery hitched to artillery shells. That says a lot about the powers that are out there fighting, and the things they have at their disposal. It also says something when you see that both sides have an element in common - one that stands and that thinks and that tries to outwit the other - and you even see respect shown for each side. In one instance we see what a man that has disarmed 800 plus bombs keeps under his bed, and these things said a lot a well.I really thought the movie was thought out quite a bit in the character side of the conflicts, not to mention the things we saw happening in the other portions of the fighting.There are moving parts in the movie as well - I really thought that some of it was horrible because of the way some of the bombing was set up. The bio-bomb that we see in the movie, for example, isn't just a person wearing a belt. There is a person wearing one in part of the movie but that is just a small part of the topic. The kid thing - that was something else.You might like this if you like movies about war seen from a different angle, although the conflict portion might not be what you expect. There are bombs, people hurt, and some interesting things exposed here. But the thing that really powers this is the human element, and the ways that different people survive (and perhaps thrive) in a conflict zone. I personally liked the movie because I had read oceans of headlines about roadside bombings and I had seen stockpiles of shells being destroyed in the sands, but I had never seen things from this angle.If you expect killing on all sides you get snippets of that in some places but this is more of a mindgame being played out. Thrill ride? Yeah, i might even say that but not in the atypical sense.It is at least worth checking into.

$REVIEW.: A group of freshman high school geeks are having problems upon their first day of school.  They are being bullied.  Now this is not your ordinary bully...the dude's crazy.  Too scared and too weak to fight back, they post an online ad for a bodyguard and along comes Drillbit Taylor (Owen Wilson) to answer their prayers.Owen Wilson being the big name star he is, was the star power for this film.  He did have a few funny parts, but it was the kids who played the three high school geeks that stole the show.  More specifically Troy Gentile who played the chubby, hip-hop loving Ryan a.k.a. T-Dog.  For a 14 year old kid, he's got some talent, giving an incredibly funny performance.  Watch for the freestyle rap battle scene.Not what you'd expect from the Apatow gang given their history, but still a funny movie.  "Drillbit Taylor" delivers bits of fun here and there.  A movie worth watching if you're in need of a laugh.  3.5 out of 5.

Yeah, that powerful folks!I'm not gonna review everything...but a few ep. I had to talk about..THE CAUTIONARY TALE OF NUMERO CINCO-Made me laugh because it was so weird.  A lot of people didn't like that ep. much.  You gotta be a fan of Mexican wrestling!Hellbound- good old fun.  We Angel as a show was som much better than Buffy.  The good guys don't always win like in Buffy.  Grey dissisions have to be made all the time.  They also made Spike more "real" and dark to me.  Good.Broken - Finally those bastards of the "scoobie gang" show there colors.  None of them liked Angel in the first place, save Buffy. This reminded me how much I hate most of the Buffy's characters.  Angel fights the REAL fight, THE real Apocalypse, and asks for nothing but a little help.  The set him up.  God, I hate the slayer and her little troupe..  Xander and Spike only made Buffy tolerable to me.Shell- wow.  I didn't see that comming by a mile.  Never thought they'd kill any of the main characters that early..  Amy Ackner kick's so much ass as an actress.  Her transformation from a dork into a God-king is amazing.The reason I always loved Angel was because of the darkness in it.  The world isn't perfect.  The descisions the team at Wolfram and Heart make is grey and changes the world.  Buffy was never about the good fight.  Sure she saves the world a few times, but never at any cost.  The good guys always win.  No one ever dies or gets hurt in the sidelines.  Just look at the joke the "apocalypse" was at season 7.  I'm all for female empowerment, but come on...a few dozen slayers fight thousands of prehistoric vamps..and win?  Buffy could barely beat one of them.  They beat the First?  It doesn't have a form, and there are other Hellmouths.  They accomplished nothing.  Not in Angel.  They fight the 1000 year war.  Good vs. Evil on this plane of existence, for the very world.All I gotta say is, I'd recomend Angel over Buffy any day.  This season has it all!  It is a no-holds-barred fight.  It's simply amazing!  Watch it!

$review_text.: Charming and witty in an English sort of way, a bit of dark humor, but all said and done, a delightful little mystery/love story with Maggie Smith, Rowan Atkinson, Kristin Scott Thomas, and of all people, Patrick Swayze.Atkinson plays against his usual rubber-faced goofball type as a well meaning albeit bumbling Vicar in a small village parish of Little Whallop. Kristin Scott Thomas is his neglected wife, with a penchant for golf lessons from the legend-in-his-own-mind golf pro, Patrick Swayze. In their busy domestic lives comes a treasure of a housekeeper, Maggie Smith, helping not only the parents but their children as well, to learn to live life "with a little grace".  Smoothing out the "wrinkles" of barking dogs, nosey neighbors, demanding parrishioners, golfing Lotharios, and the occasional pond inspectors, is all in a day's work. A heart warming if surprising twist at the end make this a truly endearing movie. A couple incidents of brief nudity, and violence heard but not fully seen, gives this a PG rating. I watched it twice to catch all the little clues I'd missed the first time when I was laughing.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and recommend it highly. Why did we here in the US not hear more of it?? Stellar performaces throughout.  Maggie Smith is a real treat to watch!  Enjoy this with someone you love, and don't forget to put the kettle on.

This was originally a stage musical and the movie looks like a stage musical.  I remember watching it many times when I was growing up, however I had not seen this movie in probably 45 or 50 years.

$review_text.: BROKEN is a brilliant movie. Made on an extremely low budget, it looks as good as / better than most of what is cranked out today. The story is simple and agonizingly well realized. However, this is about more than just a maniacal captor (Eric Colvin) and the treatment of his captive, named Hope (Nadja Brand). This is about the undying love of a mother for her daughter, and the incredible ordeals she will endure in hopes of seeing her child again. We are put in the chains and subjugated along with mum, never knowing what new horror might come next. My favorite part is when Hope finds a flower. It is the only beauty in an otherwise blighted environment. The man destroys the flower once, but Hope will not allow him to do it a second time. When another young woman is brought into the desolate camp, things get even more interesting, as she is the innocent, new fish to Hope's more hardened, experienced victim. This allows for terrifying brutality, as well as the only brief moment of humor (the potato incident). BROKEN is not for anyone who must have a happy ending at all cost. I myself am no fan of the end of this movie, as it is the final, heart-destroying insult. Still, The Hope character is so well-defined and lived by Brand that I can't give this movie less than five stars...

Someone's changed and so people who usually wouldn't be at a party together find themselves there anyway


That sets up some tensions between characters and provide red herrings as to &#34;whodunnit&#34;

$review_text.: After reading the other reviews, I really expected a really awful film, so I was pleasantly surprised that the film was not as bad as I expected.  Several reviewers said that something was missing but couldn't say what.  I can tell you.  Peter Cushing. Or some other actor of the same ability. Let's face it. Even in a part that he did not really want to play, Christopher Lee is a giant talent.  He towers over the rest of the cast and it is just not believable that this crew of very nice but remarkably ordinary people could bring down such a terrible monster. In fact, in the end they don't. The writers had to bring out a "deux ex machina" and Dracula is struck down by a bolt of lightening out of the heavens.Actually, I bought this disc for the special features. These turned out, by themselves, to be worth the purchase price. There are two parts worth mentioning. First is the commentary by Christopher Lee and the director.  this gives us several things  one is a chance to listen to Christopher as himself. He comes across as a working actor who thoroughly enjoyed his work and had a considerable respect for the other actors. I don't know how many times he repeats about another actor, "He is a lovely man." To people not familiar with the reserve typical of the English of his generation, this may  seem faint praise, but translated into American Idiom, it means "He was a joy to work with, and I loved every minute I spent with him."  But even more than the glimpse of the actor, was the insight it gave into the workings of the Hammer Film Corporation and the way they made movies. To me, who had watched so many Hammer Films, but had no knowledge of the organization behind them, except that they were filmed in England, this is very interesting. One of the great joys of DVD viewing is the look we get into the nuts and bolts of movie making through the special features tracks.In addition to the commentary, this set includes a separate disc where Mr. Lee gives a overview of his career. This is fascinating in that I had never realized that he has played in so many  different kinds of parts.  I am sorry though, that this was taped before his masterful performance as Saruman in Lord Of The Rings. I would have loved to hear his comments on that part.On the whole, the disc is just what the makers of the movie intended- a simple, low budget, mildly entertaining, typical horror movie. They weren't aiming for a classic and they didn't get one.  But I'd like to comment that given the choice of watching any of the Halloween sequels, any of the Friday the  Thirteenth sequels, or any of the Lee as Dracula sequels, Dracula wins with me hands down.

$REVIEW.: From the DVD jacket, I expected a standard horror film about bugs killing people. Instead, I got a movie about mental illness. The main problem I have with this film is that there is no one to root for. All the characters are unappealing. Remembering Ashley Judd in such films as "Double Jeopardy" just makes the whole thing worse. Yes, she played against type here and did a good job of it, but her acting did not make me like her character. Ditto for the other people in the film. This one was a waste of the $4 rental fee.

$review_text.: This is the only Shakespearean film I have yet seen in which the acting is truly excellent in every role. I read that it was filmed after a long run as a stage production, which helps to explain the ease with which these actors perform. It is shot with minimal sets and scenery, which makes this film almost like watching the actual stage version.The text is well preserved, with minimal cuts and/or placing lines out of order (a technique well loved by Welles), and there is no soundtrack, save for music that happens on stage. Again, the acting is first rate in every instance.

$review_text.: Written by Patrick McGrath, based on the novel of the same name by Patrick McGrath; directed by David Cronenberg; starring Ralph Fiennes ("Spider"  Cleg), Miranda Richardson (Mrs. Cleg/Yvonne/Mrs. Wilkinson), Gabriel Byrne (Bill Cleg), Lynn Redgrave (Mrs. Wilkinson) and John Neville (Terrence) (2002): David Cronenberg, bless his soul, likes to go places other filmmakers don't, won't, or can't. In the case of Spider, he heads back into the territory of Dead Ringers, giving us a horror story in which there is no catharsis, no growth, and no hope. It's an astonishingly bleak film.Ralph Fiennes, complete with hair that was apparently an homage to Samuel Beckett (the playwright, not the Quantum Leaper), plays the titular schizophrenic without the bells and whistles someone like, say, Robert DeNiro might have demanded. There's no showiness, no look-at-me-acting scene of yelling or imploring the audience for empathy. Spider is almost completely mute, and when he does talk, he mumbles incoherently.Spider's been released from a mental asylum into a halfway house when the movie begins, in a rundown, vaguely 1980's-looking urban England. His nickname comes from a tendency he's had since childhood to weave elaborate webs out of string and pieces of rope. He's a pattern maker. But he's also schizophrenic. The patterns he makes, the viewer needs to remember, may look sound, but they're inherently flawed.The movie takes us through Spider's reminscences of his childhood, of what seems to be an ogre-ish and unfaithful father and a saint of a mother. How reliable are Spider's memories? Therein lies the mystery of the movie, inevitable as death. This isn't a movie to enjoy in a normal way -- it's horrifying, and there's no attempt to make Spider warm and cuddly, a Hollywood madman. He's very sick. And schizophrenia doesn't spring from some easily understandable childhood trauma: it's a disease, a cancer of the mind.I was exhausted by the end of the movie, and that was from watching it in 20-minute increments over several days. But it was a good exhaustedness. But this isn't Rain Man or A Beautiful Mind. There are no easy life lessons here, no Nobel Prize, no well-meaning brother who learns valuable things from someone with cognitive difficulties, though there are, even for Spider, flashes of clarity amidst the crushing horror. And the clarity just makes the horror worse.

$REVIEW.: Wednesday, March 14, 2012Review: The Woodcarver DVD Faith & Family Films c2012The Woodcarver DVD is family approved. It is rated PG for vandalism at the opening, and arson near the middle. This is a story of restoration of a family and return to faith in belief in each other and in God. It is very well written and demonstrates reaching out to others to draw them in to find themselves within the perils of their lives.We liked this movie because it is fast moving bringing you alongside the action of every day life choices that either bring us closer or divide us.The Woodcarver Official Movie Trailer DVD [...]Matthew Stevenson is a troubled kid from a broken home. When he vandalizes the local church to get back at his parents, Matthew has to repair the damage to the church to avoid criminal charges. While working at the church, he meets Ernest (John Ratzenberger), an accomplished wood carver who created the intricate woodwork decoration that Matthew destroyed. Ernest has become something of a hermit, but reluctantly comes out of reclusion to help repair the church. Now Ernest and Matthew must work together to preserve the church's beautiful antiquity, and along the way, they also manage to restore their faith in God and in life. Run Time: 91 minutes.

I'd love to also see a new Superman series come out in this style.  Batman is getting another animated interpretation so why can't the Grand Daddy of all heroes Superman get one?  Get Paul Dini and Bruce Timm to gather the band back together for another "Super" tour.  There are so many more Superman stories to tell!  In case you were wondering about the 4 stars?

It's the story of two innocent cowboys who are relentlessly pursued by a posse.While on their way to a cattle drive, Wes (Nicholson), Vern (Mitchell) and Indian Joe (Crosse) encounter hanging corpses-- the bodies of outlaws who've been dealt "frontier justice" by a vigilante gang. The three spooked men take refuge at a cabin, unaware that their hosts are "wanted" for hijacking and murder. When the very same lynch mob besieges this hideout, Vern and Wes escape. Now labeled "outlaws" and despite having committed no crime, they stand a good chance of being caught and brutally executed.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.1) Ride in the Whirlwind (1965) - Cameron Mitchell/Millie Perkins/Jack Nicholson/Harry Dean Stanton/Katherine Squire/George Mitchell/Rupert Crosse

$REVIEW.: This is one of those films that is something of a walking contradiction.  Some of the acting is not exactly top shelf.  The story line is a little weak.  However, in my opinion this is one of the two best performances that Jan Michael Vincent ever gave.  He is backed up by a very good cast of outstanding character actors.  The music sets the stage for the suspense and the action is good without being grisly.  This may not be high art, but it perhaps serves a higher purpose.  When you come home from a brutal day and you don't want to think...you just want to be entertained....see the downtrodden guy win....see someone beat the odds.....put this movie in your player, unplug your brain, crack a cold one, lean back and enjoy the ride.  It's stress management at its best and, in the end, a well made, "feel good" movie.

Endearingly and charmingly wholesome, this movie loses none of the esential  ingredients of the story it is based upon, yet has an identity all its own,  and because of the excellent script, beautiful scenery and superb acting,  is a true rarity because it is faultless in every way.

Yes, its long but it's also measured and paced very well to allow the story to unfold in a much more natural way than most modern movies. It allows you to more fully understand the character and his motives/choices etc. The blu-ray video quality is exceptional especially considering the age of the source material. I can't give it five stars however for picture quality because there are spots that have either damage or some other (albeit minor) flaw that takes just a tiny bit away from the film over all. To spite the few flaws I saw this film looks fantastic, really. In some spots it looks like a much more recent movie, it's that good. The sound, well the sound was good but not great as you can expect based on the soundtrack's age. If you're a film buff and haven't seen this movie, borrow it or buy it. Either way you will be treated to quite an adventure. Enjoy.

Wes tried to kill the slasher genre by making SCREAM. Which coincidently was going to be titled; SCARY MOVIE. This movie is packed with hysterical laughs and outraegous kills. The movie also included trivia such as Jason wasn't the killer in the FRIDAY THE 13TH franchise until the 2nd movie. Wes Craven hired an all star cast which includes Neve Campbell (PARTY OF FIVE), David Arquette (NEVER BEEN KISSED), Courtney Cox Arquette (FRIENDS), Matthew Lillard (WITHOUT A PADDLE), Jamie Kennedy (MALIBU'S MOST WANTED), Rose McGowan (CHARMED), Skeet Ulrich (LAST DANCE), Liev Schreiber (X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE) and Drew Barrymore (E.T.

Set in London in the early 60's at the newspaper the Daily Express,the sci reporters are tracking earthquakes, floods, navigation problems and floods.It is true that the Russian's biggest ever hydrogen bomb and the American atmosphere caused a lot of fear in the early 60's.Here the governments of the world deny anything is wrong , while back-peddling , trying to figure out what is wrong and what to do about it
Since governments since the 70's have been denying global warming (pretty much), and we really no longer seem to have much of a free pressor for that matter a newspaper industry,we are left with the hope of free interchange on the internet?I liked the movie which seemed much more modern than it was.

$REVIEW.: A real favorite movie of mine, I'm really happy to see Murphy's War on DVD. ++++Spoilers++++ It is a shame for Murphy the way the end goes, and it will totally blow you away kinda like the jolt of watching the Bedford Incident ending had for me. But really, Murphy got a raw deal because those Nazi's deserved to die after all the atrocities they had done. Ok Ok they were following orders just kill the Captain I guess. Great moments of Murphy flying a seaplane and not knowing how to fly, the dropping the bombs dead on with wick fuses is really far fetched but for some reason I totally was into it and never questioned that till now. The only other thing I did notice right off was the modern sub used but thats totally understandable and its a pretty boat too. I know, I know,  war is a  bad thing, and I guess a heroic Murphy ending is very boreing so that wouldn't work. However don't forget England had Chamberlain who was the worlds darling for saving the world in 1939 or so and look what happened. Highly Recommended

$REVIEW.: I've tried many work out tapes but the problem was that many require alot of space, alot of time, very physical movements and after a while didn't hold my attention.I was skeptical at first about just walking to work out, but it is more than just walking


 It's a combo of easy/natural leg work (kicking), arm work, light weights, and brisk walking

 The system I ordered which has 1,2& 3 mile walk is perfect! I have a choice of what intensity I want to work out based on how fit I feel & how much time I have on my hands
 I started out with the 1 mile, which is a nice short 20mins workout
This is also perfect for those days I feel lazy & just want to do something short or those days where I don't have a lot of time & want to do something quick for the day

The movements are easy (kicks,knee lifts, hand swings, etc.)to follow (I can follow the video on my computer & watch TV at the same time)and the people they use on the video are diverse & fun to work out with


It is a perky crowd & I enjoy the light bantering Leslie has with them.I'm also happy there are no floor exercises which require space & is just a pain to do sometimes


 I was looking for a non-jarring workout to use while I was pregnant and this system was perfect

 You can adjust your movements with the video from a  full range motion (high kicks, small kicks, use weights or no weights, etc.)or to tiny motions to fit your own physical needs


 I am very happy with the video and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something simple & fun to use everyday
I just bought the DVD & then bought my own hand weights.

$review_text.: I have been anxiously waiting to get this the third Bond film with Daniel Craig as Bond.  After Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace this was a total surprise.  Craig is still the very physical Bond and is incredible as always.  The storyline is out of left field and you have to pay close attention to what is going on or you'll get lost.  I'm not going to spoil anything but there are more than a few surprises and endings for some people we've gotten to know in the other two films.  It is not as action packed as the previous two films, but this is still a 5 star film and I do encourage Daniel Craig Bond fans to get it.  I'm not downplaying the film, it is excellent, it just isn't up to the expectations, the previous two films gave us.  Seller was fantastic, had it in my hands in under a week.  Pick it up.

$REVIEW.: "Almost Strangers" is a very riveting BBC mini-series about a very dysfunctional and wealthy family (aren't they all?) gathering (for some weird reason) for a "family reunion".  Of course as is typical with those kinds of affairs, a lot of so called "dirty laundry" falls out of the closet--both literally and figuratively  . Most of which really isn't as bad as it is imagined to be.  As per normal there is always a "do good" family member that attempts "to put things right".  In this case it is a son of the so-called "black sheep" of the family as is so well played by Michael Gambon who gives a great performance indeed of a very strange person with his share of "demons".  His son played by Matthew Macfadyen is the "do good" family member that attempts to reconcile members that feel they (and a dead sibling) have been done wrong by a previously adored aunt that is now scorned by them.  Needless to say he fails miserably.  However, this attempt at making the aforesaid parties like each other again is the main focus of the story with the audience getting a peak at the family's history along with its "dirty little secrets".This miniseries is very well acted and directed.  If you love, as I do, a good "soapy" story about a rich family with secrets, you can't get any better than this presentation.

I think for there ever to be real peace in this world, we have to let go of this judgmental god that is part of three major faiths. Look at what's happening in this world now with the Muslims up and arms. Look at how the fundies in America is trying to change our way of life and turn our country into a theocracy.This movie is about Jesus. There was no Jesus. Historical or son of god. The Jesus story is the story of Osiris, Dionysus, Adonis, Bacchus, Mithras and other pagan gods. Do some research on it.And this movie doesn't let the moderate or liberal religious people off the hook. That to me is the best part. It would give these good people something to think about and because of that I would recommend it to some of my friends.

$REVIEW.: There were more than forty made between 1931 and 1949, Swedish actor Warner Oland appearing in 16 of them, Sidney Toler in 22 and Roland Winters in a round half dozen...Before the appearance of Chan, screen Orientals were often portrayed as being subhuman, always the villain and never the hero... If producers wanted a villain of the deadliest kind, then they chose an Oriental Chan, and to a lesser extent, other Eastern detectives like Mr. Wong (Boris Karloff) and Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre) changed all that and helped make the celluloid "Wily Oriental Gentleman" more respectable...Shrewd, courteous and slow moving, Chan's trademark was a cut price wisdom, expressed throughout all his films in phrases like "Too many mixed drinks make big headaches," and "Silence is golden except in police station."Like Vance and other popular detectives he would gather his suspects in one room, going round each in turn and finally pointing to the guilty person with the words: "You murderer." As much of his detection was based on bluff as on deduction; the condemned criminal might well have been better advised to stand his ground and challenge Chan to prove his case rather than make the traditional break for freedom...The film that is widely regarded as being one of the best Chan films is Bruce Humberstone's "Charlie Chan at the Opera." Not unlike a poor man's "Phantom of the Opera" it has Boris Karloff (in this case not the villain, just a red herring) as an operatic tenor suffering from aphasia (psychosomatic dumbness) who escapes from a mental asylum bent on revenge on his double-crossing opera singer wife... The wife duly dies and so too does her operatic lover but on this occasion the murderer is not Karloff but someone less obvious...The old Chinaman is true to form, making the police look even more heavily and slowly than usual ("Oh, no, we're not calling Chop Suey again," groans Sergeant William Demarest) and dropping his verbal gems at every twist and turn... Although set within the normal 70 minute formula for the Chan films it is faster paced than most in the series combining thrills and music and including a special opera, Carnival, composed for the film by Oscar Levant...Stars who appeared in the series and later became famous included Rita Hayworth (then Cansino), Ray Milland, George Brent and Cesar Romero...

$REVIEW.: This is Tarkovsky's most underrated film.  It is also his most beautiful, with some of the greatest cinemtography ever committed to celluloid (Giuesppe Lanci was the cinematographer).  The film concerns itself with a Russian coming to Italy to research on a Russian composer who died there.  As others have pointed out, the word "Nostalghia" is the Italian pronuciation, and the film is about nostalghia for one's homeland, specifically Russian nostlaghia.  Tarkovsky has said that Russians, more than other nationalities, miss their homeland more than others, and have a hard time assimiliating in other lands.  This film gives you one amazing shot after another.  Some of the shots are truly amazing.  The most famous shot here in where Andrei carries a candle across the pool, believing that if he makes it without the candle going out, he will save mankind.  They rehearsed this shot for 3 days, and on the 4th day they shot it.  Tarkovsky told Oleg Jankovsky (the lead actor) "one action can be experienced as if it is your whole life", then told him "we've only got one take".  They completed in one take, after which the crew burst out into appaulse.  This film is a deeply spirtual film, like all Tarkovsky, and it's one of his most meditative films.  A must see for anyone who takes cinema seriously....

$REVIEW.: First, I have to say that after reading the "5 star" reviews, my first impression was "normal people don't talk like that", and I think I'm right.  I think those reviews were written by people with financial gain hinging on people renting the movie.  The reviews were canned sounding and smacked of sales pitches.  Wouldn't be at all surprised if the reviewers created fake accounts just to review this and other stinking bad movies and get the star ratings up so that more people would watch.  They just sounded totally fake.  In the context of now having watched this awful movie, I feel even stronger that the 5 star ratings are bogus.  The movie stinks.  There's just no other way to say it.This movie was typical low budget, with 1970's technology models, and basically just one set used through 90% of the movie.  The plot was full of holes and unpredictable only in the terms of how low could it go, all except the ending in which, after years of traveling through space, struggling desperately to fix the damaged spacecraft just to get back to earth, (which he is mysteriously able to completely rewire in flight)  the main character for no apparent reason suddenly decides not to go home and be safe and reunited with his family, but instead to go shooting past earth on a suicide mission to resume the original mission plan, with no way to do so, and certain death awaiting him, which made no kind of sense whatsoever. (?????)  Right up there at the bottom with the worst I have ever seen in writing, acting, and directing.

Just take the scene when they're at the dinner table (one of my favorites) getting ready to dive into a feast of Dominos, KFC, and the always delicious Taco Bell while the two kids verbaly assault their grandfather

$REVIEW.: Quite honestly one of the greatest comedies ever filmed, `Young Frankenstein' is a marvel of cinema and a treasure for every film library.  The film sports some hilarious performances, iconic at that, not to mention a tightly woven script with jokes that actually land; all of which come together beautifully to create an extremely memorable comedic experience.  It's rare for me to find a comedy that covers every base.  As much as I enjoy a good comedy I often refer to dramatic films when speaking of `the best of film' but I would be a liar if I said that `Young Frankenstein' isn't one of the greatest `movies' ever made, let alone comedies.The film follows the grandson of Dr. Frankenstein, Frederick Frankenstein, as he inherits his grandfather's castle.  Frankenstein has spent his entire life trying to live down the reputation of his experimental grandfather but he soon finds himself falling into his granddads footsteps.  Equipped with a hunchbacked sidekick Igor, the beautiful Inga and the mysterious Frau Blucher, Frankenstein makes his own attempt at creating life from death, with some disastrous (not to mention hilarious) consequences.Gene Wilder was one hilarious actor.  I love his character creations, Frederick Frankenstein resting right up there with Willy Wonka for me.  He truly shines here, it's no wonder he considered this his favorite of all the films he made.  Marty Feldman steals this film though as Igor.  His performance is comedic genius.  The way he always manages to steal the limelight in the scene, becoming the focal point of our attention due to his marvelous comedic timing.  Teri Garr is also right on point and effortlessly captivating, but she can't hold a candle to Cloris Leachman or Madeline Kahn who are both uproarious here; especially Leachman (that whole violin scene leaves me in stitches every time).We cannot leave out the late, great, Peter Boyle who dominates this film as the monster.  He makes him human, yes, but more importantly he makes him funny.  That whole `Puttin on the Ritz' scene (arguably the best scene in the film) is precisely the reason why this film is a `must see-must own' staple for any lover of film.Mel Brooks was known for his comedies, many of which are considered classics and are adored by many.  In my humble opinion, this is his finest film.  It gets everything right, and that is a rare treat indeed.  There is not a dry spot found here, each and every gag landing right where it is supposed to (word is that for every joke that landed there were two or three that fell flat so there was a massive editing procedure done to save the film and deliver this finely polished finished product).There are plenty of spoofs out there today, films that take something classic and tear it to shreds in an effort to elicit some laughs.  Sadly many of them fall flat.  `Young Frankenstein' is the film that they should all aspire to be because it is the one film that actually manages to deliver a unique and memorable experience without tarnishing the good name of the original.  Yes, `Young Frankenstein' draws all of its humor from cracking fun at Mary Shelley's classic, but this film manages to become its own film, separate from its inspiration and thus earning its very own place in our hearts.There are few films that I could sit and watch time and time again.  This is right at the top of that very short list.

 Red Skelton does a hilarious routine with the old song "Go Tell Aunt Rhody", Marge and Gower Champion do two show-stopping dances

 Kathryn Grayson sings "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes" and "Yesterday"


 Ann Miller is her usual gorgeous self and does some fantastic tapping

 Howard Keel is in full voice as he sings "Lovely To Look At" and joins Kathryn in a duet


 You even get Zsa Zsa Gabor in her first screen appearance.This film is a awash in color, has great choreography, and a tremendous soundtrack, which includes "Lovely to Look At," "You're Devastating," "Yesterdays," "Opening Night," "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," and several other hits
 Comic genius Red Skelton stars as comedian Al Marsh, who has recently inherited half a dress shop from his aunt
Al needs the money to fund a Broadway production, so he convinces his pals Tony (Howard Keel) and Jerry (Gower Champion) to come along with him to sell his share in the salon


Arriving in Paris, the three men discover that the salon is almost bankrupt
Marsh's partners turn out to be adorable sisters, and Tony comes up with a grand plan to save the salon--turn it into a singing and dancing fashion review.In the usual musical movie fashion everything works out and all the guys and girls get together in the end
 A great old movie that is very hard to find.The transfer is clean and the picture is sharp and sparkling
 The sound is clear and even.

The original Friday the 13th is a classic slasher film. This film has little to offer except to maybe teens looking for alot of blood, nude shots, and poor acting.And now we have to look forward to a Halloween 2. I think maybe the horror genre needs a face lift because these remakes are truly lame. My advice would be wait until it hits cable.

$review_text.: Before I write this review I take full responsibility for watching this film. It's my fault and I deserve what I got. I have always loved Stephen Dorff and he is like a bad drug I can't kick. With every release he makes his movies get worse and I KNOW this yet I keep giving them a try.So I'm to blame for watching Carjacked. It's not even like I expect Stephen's movies to be good now. The last twenty have been terrible so I lost expectations back when he made Steal AKA Riders.Sigh. What can I say about this movie? Okay, it's bad. Which I am sure we all know. It's not as bad as some of Stephen's movies but that's not a compliment seeing how awful some of his movies have been.There are tons of problems with Carjacked. It's boring, it's predictable, it's slow, it's pathetic and I could go on forever.SPOILER ALERT!Roy (Dorff) carjacks Lorraine (Maria Bella, who I liked before seeing her in this and now I will run from her movies from now on) and her son Chad at a gas station. They spend the first hour of the movie bonding like they are on an inspirational field trip. At one time I expected them to start singing Kumbaya. A movie like this is supposed to be a thriller but it's hard to be on edge when the main character is chatting it up with her kidnapper like they're in Hawaii.Lorraine never tried to get away until almost the end of the film. The direction was horrible but the character development was shameful. That's what I absolutely could not forgive.At the beginning, Roy acts like Lorraine's best friend. He even seems compassionate about her ex-husband and the life she's led. Roy even takes to Chad. I mean it's obvious that he cares. But after the first hour it's like the writers went, "Oh yeah, he's supposed to be a bad guy." So we get this huge switch concerning Roy just at the spur of the moment. One minute he's opening up to Lorraine about his background and the next he's stuffing her into the hood of a car and burning her alive. It didn't make any sense.This is a bad, bad movie. I am going to vow not to watch another Stephen Dorff picture again and I suggest you do the same for your sanity if not anyone else's.I keep hoping that things will get better but Dorff has gone down the drain of D-movie status and looks like there's no possible chance of rescuing him.Sad. Sad. Sad.In the famous words of Deacon Frost, "What a waste."

$review_text.: Being a teen in the 1980's I grew up with a lot of the teen sex comedy romps, at the time I thought these movies were hilarious, and couldn't get why older people didn't think they were funny as well, fast track 20 years later, watching some of these movies again, as an adult I can see why.Superbad fits this category, I believe those in the 14-20 year range might find this "coming of age" teen comedy funny, but adults might look at it as nothing more than a film of some teen boys running around trying to get sex, and swearing a whole lot, and I mean a lot, ok the entire film. The one thing about the movies with the lovable dorky guys in high school are to make them seem, well likeable, as the cool kids treat them like crap, and they wind up coming out on top at the end, the thing about Superbad, I didn't find the characters likeable at all, Seth was nothing more than a foul mouth vulgar jerk, and Evan lacked any real depth. The scene stealing Fogell character had some laughs, but that was about it.Another thing is these characters existed in some weird fantasy world, where the cool kids were only the boys, who treated them like crap, but the hot girls they were interested in, well they were really nice, and liked them back, man, where was this high school at? What I remember cool kids both male and female treated the un-cool kids horrible, and wouldn't give them the time of day,so this aspect in the film of the hot girls being really great to our loveable loser heros, laughable in the way it's not at all plausible in the least. And the adults in this film (cops,convience store cashiere etc) being total morons,okay right.And I find no comparison to this film with Revenge of the Nerds, that film actually pretty much depicted how the so called "Geeks, Nerds and Losers" were treated, and one of the main characters ending up with the snotty popular cheerleader was at least possible. What I got from this film, was if I shot a 90 min movie with two boys sitting on a couch cussing up a storm, talking about sex it would make millions.To me this film just isn't anywhere near as funny as Revenge of the Nerds, or the more recent film, The 40 year old Virgin, those films made me laugh, this one just made me fast forward it through scenes, and wish I could have got my rental money back.

$REVIEW.: A young girl begins sleepwalking and saying the words "silent hill" before she awakens. The girl was adopted and originally lived in West Virginia. The mother does some research and finds out there is a town called Silent Hill in West Virginia and decides to take her daughter there to find a reason for the girl's problems. Silent Hill, it turns out is a dead town, consumed by an underground mine fire, and is fenced off from civilization. The mother is pulled over by a motorcycle cop who thinks she looks suspicious. The mother thinks the cop is suspicious herself and takes off. She blows through the fence and into Silent Hill, eventually crashing to a stop. When she comes to, her daughter is gone and she searches the ominous town for her. She eventually meets up with the cop again who also crashed her motorcycle and they find that Silent Hill is a very strange and haunted place. They are attacked by creatures made of fire and ash, they watch another creature kill a woman and end up in a church with a cult that follows the whims of one paranoid, deranged woman. The mother eventually faces the creature in the darkness and learns the secrets of the town and her adopted daughter.Silent Hill is a bad movie, mainly because it has no soul. The story, while odd, is not all together original and the movie depends too heavily on effects. Some of the effects are very cool, but meaningless as far as advancing the story. Also the story does not entirely make sense. Things happen that are never explained and the ending was confusing. The movie is too long for this type of film and the middle section gets pretty boring. A good actor, Sean Bean, is wasted with virtually nothing to do as the girl's father. I wasn't surprised to find out that this was adapted from a video game because with all the effects taking center stage you never get a real connection to the story.

$REVIEW.: This is a classic movie starring paul walker and vin deisel


I use to think walker was hot but he is so boyish and too pretty boy for me, like the nsync metro-sexual (heterosexual guys who dress pretty and look gay but are not) I'm more into manly men like vin deisel


He is the sexiest guy i've ever seen


And so is michelle rodrigez

In fact if i were given one opportunity to have one threesome with anyone my first choice would be vin deisel and michelle rodrigez, who dated a while ago


But back to this movie, sorta bad influence on teenage boys who think it's cool to race cars but if it's not taken seriously then it's ok, because it's only for entertainment


Good music, good drama, some humor, and overall good action movie with good actors


But Vin Desiel is the best and when i found out he wasn't in the sequel i didnt wanna even see it at first but i did, in theatre's and it was ok, but a little bit over the top
Some overacting, and to me the asian model that was in the sequel wasn't even that cute


The one that raced at the beginning and as she raced she did a jump over a bridge i think it was and said SPANK MY ASS


I don't know kinda cheesy, lol.

$REVIEW.: When Prep and Landing first aired on Television, we absolutely loved it!  It was probably one of the best new animated Christmas specials that we had seen.  A year later, Totally Tinsel came out and we did not hold out high hopes since most sequels are a little flat.This sequel, while not as surprising as the original since we had already been introduced to the main character, was indeed as good as the first one!  We enjoyed the heck out of it and started looking to buy both.  When we found this twin pack, we bought it as it was exactly what we were looking for.The DVD is every bit as good and the quality is stellar.  Now, we can watch it each Christmas and not have to worry if we will be home when it airs or even if it will be aired.I would highly recommend this collection if you love animated Christmas Specials.

$REVIEW.: While not perfect, 'The Freshman' knows what the audience wants and, while not overdoing it, hit the right chords.  Spoofing (or should I say poking fun at) 'The Godfather', The Freshman allows Marlon Brando to reprise his oscar winning role, channeling Vito Corleone in Mafioso Carmine Sabatini.  Instead of allowing the audience to make the comparison themselves they immediatly make it for you aknowledging that Carmine was the inspiration for the central charactor in the Godfather films.  This film follows Matthew Broderick who plays Clark Kellog (like the breakfast cereal) as he attends NY Film School.  He inadvertantly meets and ends up employed by Carmine, which leads to his involvment in illegal activities that endanger his life and the life of a Kamodo Dragon (hilarious, believe me).  The film, instead of bombarding you with laugh after laugh, has it's slow spots, but when the laughs come (most involving the lizard) they come hard and they are well worth the weight (the whole mall scene is worth the whole film).  When you get to the whole 'Gourmet Club' scene it's just priceless!  Marlon Brando gives a great performance, and Penelope Ann Miller as his beautiful and seductive daughter Tina does well (my father thinks Clark to be an 'A' student).  All together this is a well packaged comedy that delivers the goods quite well...and Marlon Brando, I mean, how many times can I say watch it for Marlon Brando...awesome performance.

$REVIEW.: Alas, modern filmmakers can produce something that looks pretty good, even when the movie is God-awful.  Otherwise, the Eighteenth Angel would be another "plan 9," full of camp, awful acting, and a plot so dumb that it almost defies description.Watching Maximillian Schell pretending to be a deranged Italian Abbott, and trying to fake English with an Italian accent, despite being German--well, that's worth the price of the disk.  My wife and I have been immitating him for years, explaining every bizzare occurence with his meorable line:  "its-a the-a-marriage of-a science and-a Satan."You'll blow milk bubbles out your nose at the storyline where Max foolishly concludes that some demented midieval glockenspiel maker has determined the hour of Satan's return.  Max has won over all the moronic monks of his abbey and they are now busily preparing the way, apparently having scraped up a few hundred million dollars from the collection plate to fund a mad genetic scientist.  An assenine American father and his dumb daughter make an insane decision to go to Italy and live by the abbey and are so crazy that the witless teenager lets herself get sucked into the plot as a potential pretty face for the devil.  Did I mention that everyone appears stupid and nuts?It's a hoot!

$REVIEW.: While she was out is a rather disturbing movie. Kim Basinger plays the role of a house wife, consumed by her twin children, she wants to enjoy them and does not keep a tidy home... rooms are a mess.Her husband comes home after a tiring day fighting the corporate world, we hear him at the door talking to a friend about Enron, setting the stage for a person consumed by office politics and economic forces.This frustrated man releases his anger on his wife, asking her; what does she do with her day? Toys and clothing are all over the house. He gets violent and we start to feel for this poor woman who simply wants to enjoy her children.On the night before Christmas, Kim Basinger goes shopping for last minute stuff to wrap the presents for her family... As she drives to the mall, the stage is set... her cell phone is almost out of battery, she does not even have the car charger and she calls a friend but there is no answer. While driving to the mall, she is distracted, almost has an accident and has difficulty finding a parking space.She sees an available space only to realize that a selfish customer took two spaces and there is no room for her car. So, she writes a note to tell this person that he / she is selfish. The movie is not too clear as to why she is later recognized as the note originator, whether they know because her name was on the note or because they saw her walk away from the car.While she is shopping, she sees a previous acquaintance and you sense her pain as she sees the other woman buying the very item she walks away from.When she gets back to the parking lot, it is now late and everyone is going home. The owners of the car where she left the note is a group of young people that seem to be under the influence of drugs, looking to hurt her and make her pay for the insulting note.A policeman comes to her rescue and gets killed trying to help her but this gives her time to get in her car and drive away. But she is followed and gets involved in a desperate set of circumstances that would drive any person mad.One by one, she deals with her aggressors and in an effort not to reveal the plot all we want to say is that the movie encourages viewers to keep a toolbox in the trunk and to take self defense classes.If you like to view movies that keep you at the edge of your seat... this movie is the one to watch. Kim Basinger is simply superb...

$review_text.: Eric Stanze, who directed the enjoyable SAVAGE HARVEST, has gone one step further with his newest film, ICE FROM THE SUN - a work of amazing creativity and craftsmanship!With this film, he combines more traditional horror elements (as seen in his previous works) and expends them into an epic tapestry of dark surrealism and cinematic experimentation

The story focuses on the enigmatic Alison (wonderfully played by Ramona Midgett), a recent suicide victim who becomes the unwilling pawn in a cosmic struggle between the combined efforts of the angels in heaven and the devils in hell and the Presence (played by the equally excellent DJ Vivona), a murderous entity whose in control of his own dimension, a dimension of pain, death and chaos that can only be entered by someone of flesh and blood
Alison is given the task of wandering through this chaotic realm to find the Presence, and exterminate him

Her mission is masked by the arrival of six other humans, who are the latest players of the Presence's sadistic games of murder and mayhem
Who will survive?Besides its unique story, ICE FROM THE SUN has a lot to offer! Stanze's direction is energetic and solid, and gets rewarding performances from his entire cast, including Todd Tevlin as the drug-pushing Aaron and Angela Zimmerly as the strong and resourceful Dana.The editing is razor-sharp and wonderfully non-linear! The frame composition and the camerawork are equally stylized! The chaotic atmosphere is further enhanced by the moody lighting by Director of Photography David Berliner, who pushed the Super 8mm format to maximum effect! And to top it all off, Brian McClelland and Matt Meyer have created an amazingly textured soundscape, offering a wide array of dark sound effects and haunting musical compositions!The special effects are another asset of this production

Tony Bridges (who created the effectively gory effects in SAVAGE HARVEST) teams up with Tommy Biondo and Jeff Bergeron to create numerous splatter set pieces that have to be seen to be believed!All in all, this is a true work of passion and artistic exploration by everyone involved
Comparisons to films like LOST HIGHWAY, CLEAN,SHAVEN, BEGOTTEN are not out of place
It's films like these that aren't afraid to take chances and to step outside the boundaries of traditional formulaic filmmaking to break new ground! Fans of more mainstream entertainment may not enjoy this film (they'll probably be very annoyed with it), but people who are looking for something bizarre and original will be right at home here!

$REVIEW.: All Bond films require huge suspensions of disbelief which are happily given for the ride. This one is no exception and delivers vast quantities of thrills and near misses. James does battle with Korea this time, one of the few remaining unknown evil entities in the world. Interestingly, one of the most engaging scenes involves not fantastic inventions but good old-fashioned swordplay between Pierce Brosnan as Bond and the villain, Gustav Graves, dashingly portrayed by Toby Stephens. For once, all the eye candy is not reserved for the men in the audience as Stephens plays the handsome baddie for all he's worth. And he is worth millions...in diamonds. The other kind of ice featured is a palace made of it, a perfect venue for an amazing car chase. Halle Berry and Rosamond Pike offer the stuff men's dreams are made of. All in all, a very entertaining trip to fantasy land.

$REVIEW.: I've wanted to see Robert Altman's "3 Women"(1977) for long time and finally saw it last night. The references to one of my all time favorites, Ingmar Bergman's "Persona" are obvious: two young women, the main characters (seemingly meek, childlike Pinky and outgoing and seemingly popular but in reality a sad loser Millie seem almost to exchange identities, or to become one in a desperate search for connection and sense of belonging but "3 Women" is memorable and haunting on its own terms. It makes you think long time after it's over. As a matter of fact, I am still thinking about it. I think that it is an incredible work of an extraordinary master. As always in his best films, Robert Altman is terrific - innovative, iconoclastic, free-spirited, unconventional, and truly original. He is a great humanist who sees through his characters but never makes fun of them and he understands them. Under his directing, Shelly Duvall and Sissy Spacec gave two astonishing performances. They were both great but Duvall was a revelation. She adapted the loquacious Millie's personality and become the character. Altman had discovered Duvall at one of the malls in Texas where she was selling cosmetics and given her roles in his six films. I want also to mention the eerie music, the dreamy and uneasy atmosphere of something sinister ready to happen, the scary and mesmerizing murals on the bottom of the pool that the third woman, silent and mysterious, tired and wise Willie (Janice Rule) was painting. Altman did not try to trick or confuse me, and the story seems to be simple one but I am not sure that I understood everything, especially the enigmatic ending. Altman was aware of the effect of his movie to the viewers and in his commentary he says that he sees the film as a painting and that the audience should feel it but not understand it. In this regard it also reminds of "Un chien andalou" (1929) which was supposed to be experienced directly and not analyzed by the viewers."3 Women" is another great film by one of the best American film directors. I've never seen a bad film from Robert Altman.4.5/5

$REVIEW.: Actually, Tom Cruise has come back to Earth (in real life) and his being cast in a Sci-Fi movie occurring right here on earth is quite appropriate
But I love a good Sci-Fi movie and this one is pretty good

It evokes emotions like 2001 Space Odyssey
Beautiful
You don't like the acting? What are you comparing it to? Its Tom Cruise
Hey, he does all his own stunts, convincingly

He's no J


Nicholson or A


Hopkins but he's not a bad actor
I'm glad he's come back to reality (again, in real life)
You think there is too much CGI? Too Digital? Again, what are you comparing it to? Are you sure you knew you were watching a Sci-Fi movie? Actually if you watch the "Making of" on the blu-ray it explains there is a lot more "reality" in the movie than you might think and less CGI

But its a modern science fiction movie
CGI is required to tell the story, but I think this movie is a perfect balance


The drones are the coolest, even though they are villains
I love the noises they make..

kind of like R2-D2 on steroids

The score is fantastic


You can watch the movie with only the score playing

That's a little weird, but the score can probably stand on its own if you are into just listening to a movie soundtrack by itself


One question I have about one of the characters, Vika, is why are her eyes so dilated all the time? It is spooky looking


Why I am writing a review of this movie that hundreds of people have already given their dumb opinions of, I don't know

Just thought I would offer mine because I liked it so much

Besides the movie, the "making of" is a very interesting documentary

Its in 5 parts and in HD as well

Its almost as good as the movie itself

I own the blu-ray and the video is of outstanding quality

Can't comment on the audio since I have not watched it with surround.

$REVIEW.: ALIEN APOCALYPSE is much better than you might expect.  Filmed for the Scifi Channel and featuring cult fave Bruce Campbell, the movie benefits from its tongue in cheek delivery and some pretty decent termite aliens.  It's far superior to the more recent MAN WITH THE SCREAMING BRAIN and it's gung ho "let's knock some alien ass" message may be overdone, but for this type of movie, it works.  The movie is rather violent, but it's so stylized and cartoonish, it doesn't detract from the film.  Campbell seems to be having a good time in this one, something he didn't seem to be doing in SCREAMING BRAIN.  A fun homage to those fifty scifi bug movies.

$REVIEW.: I've been a fan of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu since 2003's '21 Grams' and so when they aired `Amores Perros' on IFC a few weeks back I just had to watch it.  Following the same formula as '21 Grams' Inarritu gives us a brilliant story that interconnects the lives of three very different people with a very tragic event.We first have Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who is living with his brother Ramiro (Marco Perez) and his wife Susana (Vanessa Bauche).  Ramiro is abusive and cold and this leads to a heated affair between Octavio and Susana.  In order to make enough money for the two of them to run off together Octavio begins fighting his Rott for money.We next have Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero), a TV producer who gives up his life with his family in order to pursue a relationship with supermodel Valeria, but a tragic car accident causes their relationship to unravel, their nerves to get frayed and their love to slowly and painfully die.The last story in the trilogy revolves around El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria), a homeless man who makes money as a hitman.  When El Chivo is hired by a businessman to kill his partner only to find out his partner is also his brother, he has a chance to teach them both a lesson and learn something himself.It may be the car crash that links these three stories, but it's the people within them, the lives they live and the lessons they learn that connect them on such a deeper and more meaningful level.  The acting is brilliant here, with both Bernal and Echevarria turning out award worthy work, and truth be told for a debut directorial piece Inarrito delivers a near flawless film.

$REVIEW.: `Desperate Hours' calls us to question why do we do the things we do? Or rather why do these characters do the things they do? Neither the villains or heroes actions seem to make any sense.The plot: Mickey Rourke in the role he was born to play stars as a brilliant armed robber who escapes from prison with the help of his beautiful girlfriend and attorney Kelly Lynch.Rourke reunites with his henchmen whom are not as smart as the Three Stooges. Together they head for the suburbs of Utah and hold the state's only nuclear family, Anthony Hopkins, Mimi Rogers and their two kids hostage in their mansion.FBI agent Lindsey Crouse is hot on their trail with an army of cops to take Rourke down without harming the Hopkins family.Why it works. As I said Rourke truly gives the performance of his career and a hansom devil psycho. Hopkins and Rogers also work especially Rogers as the house wife next door. We really hate Rourke and we really love the family.The production quality is also very high. From costume design to photography to editing, to the score which is reminiscent of the 1940s noir thrillers on which the film was based. The production quality really is good enough to make the whole film worth while.The big flaw the film makers have to overcome is WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? Why is the now freed Rourke only exposing himself of more heat be kidnapping the family. While his stated motive is because he is waiting to reunite with Kelly Lynch, a far better idea would be to hide out unseen. Secondly why is Lynch leading to police right to Rourke's front door? Shouldn't she be hiding too? And if Rourke is so psychotically evil why does he not physically harm the family?That's the annoying thing. There are many lapses in logic. 1. Rourke escapes from a courthouse cell with Lynch's inner thigh pistol and disables the one single guard on duty.2. Lynch in police custody plans to pretend to be an innocent. Wouldn't she already be guilty of bringing a gun into the court house?3. Why is Rourke holding the family hostage if not to harm them?4. The hostages themselves are equally incompetent. They have many chances to escape and do not. Rourke even allows the teenage daughter to go out on a date with her boyfriend. I think most people would change their plans and give up a date save their family by going to the police.5. The police themselves are silly. They allow the apprehended Lynch to enter the house and warn Rourke of the hundreds of cops outside.6. The police rather than using sniper rifles use submachine guns at one point spraying the entire house with bullets with reckless disregard for the family. Yet they hit only one of the criminals.7. Another odd sequence of evens is when one of the gang is told to get rid of the corpse of the family's murdered Realtor. Was the basement full? Why draw more attention? The criminal draws attention to himself by driving erratically and takes to body out into the country. Instead of hiding he goes to the nearest gas station covered in blood asking for help. The first people he meets are Playmates. His lucky day but what are the odds? He then returns to the shallow grave where he is met by dozens of SWAT team members. How'd they get their so fast? And why are they just waiting around for him to show up?

$REVIEW.: Much like Into The Sun, this had all the ingredients for a Seagal come back but yet again the producers of yet another Seagal movie miss the opportunity to deliver a great Seagal action thriller. The movie is again handicapped in the same manner as Into The Sun and Submerged by the recurring problem of what appears to be Seagals disregard of the script or perhaps due to the lack of a script where he seems to make up his own dialogue to fill out a scene. It's as if the camera is turned on and Seagal makes it up as he goes along, conversations involving Seagal and other characters make no sense or have any relevance to the story at hand. In Seagals recent movies there always appears to be a scene which is simply there to give Seagal an ego boast. "Walks like a Black man, breaths like a killer", what was that all about??The main armored car chase scene is lifted directly from another film made 10 years ago and also the open scenes of The Order with Van Damme is used as the opening scenes in this. I also think though I might be wrong but all the aerial shots of the prison and the prison structure itself looked the same as those used in the Wesley Snipes movie Undisputed.Seagals body double is ever present as usual, Seagals line delivery at times is terrible, yet another muddled and confusing plot and character relevance to the story, Seagal love scene!, fake back drop special effects and bad acting from allot of the supporting cast members are all here present and correct as has become the norm with Seagal movies of late.However it's not all bad, this is a big step up from Submerged, there is no voice dubbing, there are flashes of the old Seagal when he sticks to the script and does his own fight scenes which the two while he is in prison appear to be all Seagal and he is looking in better shape than his last few outings. For me, it was worth the rental as it's not all bad but it did feel very flat and uninteresting while watching it.In Seagal's post Exit Wounds DTV years, for me Belly Of The Beast is the mark to aim for and the only one up to and including this one to be recommended. Today You Die is worth a rental to keep up with Seagal's output but only worth adding to your collection for the die hard Seagal fan.

Loosely based on the real-liferomance between the writer George Sand, played by Judy Davis in mostly men's clothing,and Chopin, the composer.  It is period-piece farce at itsbest about the private machinations behind the public lives of artistsin times past.  I loved Judy Davis and Hugh Grant in this movie.  A joyto watch.

The fact is, we did know the chances were extremely low, and the protesters before the war began numbered in the millions.  The media, rather than investigating and out of fear of being "unpatriotic" fell in lockstep with the administration.Times right now are scary, and this movie shows how the freedoms we take for granted are being grievously abused.

$review_text.: The story is simple, Shakespearean to the absolute extreme you can imagine. The peace and happiness of Venice is disturbed by the simple fact that a Moor, Othello, is welcomed as a hero after a battle he won in Cyprus. He is married to the daughter of a high ranking family, Desdemona, who is carrying in her own name the fact that she has a very doomed, demonized lot due to this very disruptive situation and love. This creates a rivalry, antagonism with the captain of the fleet, Cassio, and the extreme envy if not hatred from Iago is enough to turn a disruption, a breach of balance into a major catastrophe. A handkerchief and its supposed or alleged circulation will sign the end of Desdemona strangled by Othello, a strangulation that is very strange in this film since she will survive it long enough to expose her murderer and then die peacefully. Iago is then exposed in his treachery, killed by Othello with a spear instead of being tortured to death, and Othello finally kills himself with a dagger and still no blood at all. And balance is found again after the drama, the balance of sorrow, mourning and justice in a way. The play by Shakespeare and this opera reveals a deep racist inspiration. Othello is bringing this drama to Venice because he is a Moor, an Infidel, a Blackman, etc...That theme exists in other plays like "Titus Andronicus" or "The Merchant of Venice", with an anti-Semite dimension in these latter cases. The common theme is the hatred from a mediocre person who is trying to get even with better people than him by destroying them through some kind of plotting. But this plotting leads to the ultimate ruin of the plotter. We have to look over this dimension, common in Shakespeare's time, and see the more universal dimension. The man who is successful will inspire jealousy, envy and even greedy hostility. In this case, the object of that envy is Othello's wife and the game is to make the successful warrior kill his love, which he does out of some jealous lust, some possessive desire. The subsequent drama and the repentance of Othello shows how things are changing in these renaissance years, how women are little by little capturing some individual existence of their own, on the way to freedom, even if it ends up in death altogether. In fact Shakespeare in his English society is more advanced than Verdi in his 19th century Italy. Shakespeare doubles the point by making Desdemona's maid the final and lethal accuser of Iago and his lying and conspiring. We have to think of Romeo and Juliet but this latter case is pure love, no conspiration, jealousy or whatever, though the end is the same apart from the poison. A double death in the name of love. Zeffirelli does a pretty good job by creating a rich environment, at times maybe too rich. A slightly leaner production would have probably emphasized the beauty of the music and the singing. Othello as well as Desdemona reach the depth and density the tragedy requires. The cluttered setting de-concentrates our attention, even maybe our interest. The singing and the music require a stylized setting for our eyes not to get lost in the jungle of the visuals, short-circuiting our ears in their enjoyment of their listening.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

$REVIEW.: Ok,... I do NOT think this movie is scary,(it is suspensful, but not scary), and I do NOT think it is as good as 'Scream'-the 1996 thriller that gave the Box-Office a '90s horror shake- , but in some ways it is better.  I enjoyed the idea of 'Stab 3' and of Sidney hiding out in the hills of Los Angeles, but it just doesn't have that wonderful, creepy, jump-to-the-edge-of-your-seat fun that 'Scream' was totally filled to the brim with! Only see 'Scream 3' if you have seen the first two (1996 &amp; 1997), or else you will not have one CLUE WHAT IS GOING ON!  I also thought that it was kind of sad that the cameos in this film,(Jenny McCarthy, Parker Posey etc.) - are more exciting than the lead roles! ( Although Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette are excellent and experienced actors).  And, I just wish that it was MORE SCARY! I WANT IT TO BE MORE SCARY!  So, see 'Scream 3' today because over all it was a great '90s horror flick, but don't forget the original 'Scream' (the best, too).  Starring: Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette, -and featuring Parker Posey and Jenny McCarthy.  Check out my other reviews for : 'Scream', 'National Lampoon's Vacation', 'Finding Forrester', 'Scream 2','Con Air', 'The Family Man', 'Father of the Bride', 'Vegas Vacation', 'Romy and Michelle's Highschool Reunion', and much much more!

$REVIEW.: I recently watched All Quiet on the Western Front because my instructor for my history class informed me that it might be a useful form of research for a paper I had to write


Unfortunately, it wasn't
Still, I sat through the entire two hours and by the end of it I felt kind of conflicted
I've never been big on history, and WWI, to me, is such a generic topic

People look back on history and they usually think of WWI or WWII
That's fine, both are important events in history, but there is more to it than that

However, I'm getting off topic.All Quiet on the Western Front takes place at the beginning of WWI


We start in a German classroom where a school teacher is trying to rile up his class of young boys to join the war

Now, of course, he doesn't directly say "you should join the war", but he might as well have

As the movie progresses you follow this group of young men through their experience as a soldier

One by one they start to realize that war isn't all it's cracked up to be and one by one the viewer sees each of them die.For it's time I'm sure All Quiet on the Western Front was revolutionary, but by today's standards it's just ok


The story itself was very well written and kept me engaged throughout majority of the film
However, I do feel that it could've benefited from a shorter running time
There were a few scenes that were kind of boring and I kept checking the time to see if it was almost over
Thankfully, this only happened a handful of times, like three or four, so it didn't completely ruin the experience.The film's main goal was to inform the viewer on the horrors of war and, in this regard, it succeeded
Life as a soldier isn't easy and the writers made sure to constantly remind the viewer of this


Whether it was because of their cramped bunkers, their lack of food, or the frantic warfare, all these soldiers wanted to do was go back home
As the movie progressed you started feeling bad for these characters and even, in some cases, sympathetic.The movie has a pretty wide cast of recurring characters and, for the most part, the actors did a fine job at bringing them to life


Lew Ayres, who played one of the film's key characters Paul Baumer, did a phenomenal job and was definitely the standout of the cast

I look forward to checking out some of his other work
The film also includes performances by Richard Alexander, William Bakewell, and Slim Summerville, among others.Overall Score: 8/10 - As I stated earlier I'm not big on history, but All Quiet on the Western Front made for a pretty entertaining film


The story was well written and you eventually felt something for these characters

Some of the actors obviously outperformed the others, but none of them did such a poor job that it made the film unwatchable
If you're a fan of history, specifically WWI, then I would recommend giving this a go if you have a free evening.

$review_text.: OK. So technically speaking the denizens of 'The Simpsons' have 8 fingers apiece, but that would destroy the title alteration. Let me distract you from that 'untruth' with this shiny object. Oohhh look at it sparkle!Anyway - It took 20 odd years for the Simpsons Movie to happen, the obvious question is: was it worth the wait?The problem with taking any popular half-hour TV show and stretching it to film length is that you fundamentally alter the formula that made the series successful. The quick pace of the TV-show gives it snap and momentum and frees it from the necessity of plot and even believable continuity.Though the Simpsons movie manages  more than a half-hours worth of clever jokes it doesn't come close to hilarity of some of the series' best episodes. The remaining time is filled with rehashed plot-lines:  Marge and Homer's marital difficulties, Homer and Bart's father son difficulties, and Lisa's boy difficulties. I will say that the animation is gorgeous - easily several notches better than on TV.For a fan of the Simpsons this is must see - but it should have been more memorable. The movie gets 4 stars - the lack of extras on the DVD is why I ended up giving it 3. A few exclusive cartoon shorts or cut animations would have be nice, but that's probably being saved for a future 'special edition'.

$REVIEW.: Don't listen to those detractors of this exercise video. I consider myself an intermediate, and I find it a great routine. I have been doing this tape on and off for years now, and I am not bored with it. In fact after you really get to know the routine and steps, it's a lot of fun, and there are certainly enough ways in which you can challenge yourself. Beginners can start on the floor before advancing to the step. And once you are using the step you can increase the height as you get fitter. Plus there are different levels of intensity that you can follow, for example, bigger arm movements or higher knee or leg lifts, plus you can do high impact moves as opposed to lower impact. The instructors are friendly and helpful, and each movement is easy enough to follow so you're not falling over your feet all the time (which can lead to injury) like some exercise tapes I've done. The final 10 minutes you get a one-on-one with Jane for a great ab workout that really works. This is a workout that will make you feel and look wonderful. Recommended.

$REVIEW.: Surely, the studio that had Errol Flynn under contract could have chosen a more dashing romantic lead for ANTHONY ADVERSE.As it is, Fredric March, usually such a fine actor, was unable to give more than a leaden performance in the title role. He has never appeared less enthusiastic and does a completely uninspired job as the hero. Sad to say, there are no sparks between March and de Havilland (as Angela)--and furthermore, he seems too old for the role despite clever make-up attempts to make him look suitable.But aside from the fact that he is miscast, there is a lot to admire about the film itself. For one thing, Claude Rains and Gale Sondergaard make the most memorable pair of villains ever seen in a 1930s movie. The sequence where they cause a coach and driver to go off a cliff is given an extra punch by their dialog. "He was my favorite coachman," says Rains dryly. "The coach was rather handy too," quips Sondergaard. Giving other outstanding performances are Edmund Gwenn, Louis Hayward, Anita Louise, Donald Woods and Akim Tamiroff. Edmund Gwenn is particularly touching as Mr. Bonnyfeather.Some of the acting styles seem dated, as are the titles that connect the time span. It must have been quite a job to trim the story down to a little over two hours. The best-seller was a bulky 1,200, forcing the scriptwriter to exclude whole segments of the book. Strange how the celebrated novel by Hervey Allen is barely remembered today.Olivia de Havilland makes a gorgeous Angela in one of her earliest roles and all of the opera scenes are interesting to watch but she is not quite credible as Napoleon's mistress. The story is a cumbersome one and the pace, under Mervyn LeRoy's direction, is rather slow. Nevertheless, it's an interesting historical drama of the Napoleonic era with Rains and Sondergaard giving the best performances. I've written articles on both Raines and Sondergaard, published in CLASSIC IMAGES, inspired by their work in this film. Sondergaard went on to win Best Supporting Actress for her job as Faith, the cunningly evil housekeeper.And last, but not least, Erich Wolfgang Korngold's rich background score adds dimension to every aspect of the story, fully justifying the Oscar for Best Original Score of 1936.Summing up: Some weaknesses, but still an important film from the Golden Age of movies.

$REVIEW.: This is a compelling and original film. For almost two decades the plight of East Germany has been neglected in art, overshadowed by the monolitic evil prevalent in pre 1945 Germany. But in reality, the poor citizens of East Germany, partitioned off into the Russian sector after World War II, lived for years under an equally menacing and brutal dictatorship. Ok the Stazi didn't kill as many people as the Nazi's, but as George Orwell said, the most perfect dictatorship doesn't need to kill anyone. The Stazi, informers for the puppet Moscow compliant government of East Germany up until 1989, scrutinized every aspect of citizens' lives, snuffing out any individual liberty and freedom their compatriots in the West enjoyed. Life was pure, dogged, misery for so many people.So this film by Florian Henckel von Donnersmark, his debut, is a welcome addition to the European cinema scene. It is a subtle and thrilling tale, superbly acted and scripted, which portrays the plight of Georg Dreyman, a popular playwright who is a supporter of Communism but sympathetic to dissidents which earns him the suspicion of the regime. Hardline Stazi informer, Gerd Weisler, brilliantly portrayed by Ulrih Muhe, who tragically died of stomach cancer shortly after filming, is dispached to monitor the actions of Dreyman and his actress girlfriend. In a moving story that unfolds along the premise of a saying attributed to Lenin that he couldn't appreciate Beethoven's Appasionata as it made him sympathise with the little people he needed to crush in order to instigate revolution, Weisler finds Dreyman's world of culture, art and music a warm and humane antidote to his own solitary life in a tower block where his only solace comes from visits by a elephantine thighed Stazi commissioned hooker.After a composer friend of Dreyman commits suicide, Dreyman breaks ranks with the regime and writes a piece using a smuggled typewriter (all East German computers were registered) on suicide rates in East Germany. Suspicions amongst the police grow, and Weisler finds himself under pressure to close the net in on Dreyman and his girlfriend.The denoument is tragic, followed by a heartfelt epilogue which takes the time frame beyond the falling of the Berlin wall, and redemption for the hardline Weisler. The closing lines are a beautiful cinematic Haiku (though only appreciated in the original German).The film is beautifully terse with the bleakness of East Germany brought out with realistic browns and subtle greys, period details that give a good indication of the privations of life beyond the Iron curtain.The film is not flawless - not a single joke (I know it's a serious film, but even Macbeth has the Porters' scene) and a rather overblown score slightly chip the poise and balance of the movie.For a greater understanding of the movie's context in historical and cinematic terms, I urge people to read Timothy Garton Ash's brilliant review in the New York Review of Books, you can easily find it via google.

$REVIEW.: You can't go wrong with a Gene Wilder movie when you want to watch something fun. This movie has always been a favorite of mine, not just because of Gene Wilder, but because it feels like a mystery movie that just happens to be comedic. This is also a wonderful movie where you can see the comedic chemistry between Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner.

$REVIEW.: This is about as bad as a sci-fi film can possibly get. The story makes very little sense (I haven't read the book). Also, the script is very poor and makes it hard for an otherwise fine cast not to appear ridiculous. The film had a $50 million budget and yet its special effects are quite bad even by 1984 standards. David Lynch is a great director and thus one can wonder how he managed to create a travesty like this. Do yourself a favour and stay far away from this piece of ****!

$review_text.: All I can say is wow!  This is, in my opinion, the best MST3K episode of the Joel era.  No, the movie has nothing to do with "science"-fiction and there's no real "mystery" to speak of, so it may not be the quintessential MST3K episode, but to me, it's one of the funniest.I think one of the main reasons for that is that the movie really isn't that poorly done.  Yeah, it's boring, unoriginal and downright goofy at times, but it was not all that poorly made.  With many of the episodes, the writers could just sit there and point out continuity errors, editing foul-ups, flubbed lines, and many other things in succession for the whole movie.  With this one, they were forced to work a little harder and I think the jokes show that.Really, the director seemed at least competent, the production design, while not spectacular, was at least not poor.  The acting, for the most part, was serviceable, especially from vets like Martin Balsam and John Saxon.Really, it had many great elements for an MST3K movie:  1) slovenly, unlikeable "hero", 2) goofy, stereotypical villains ("I'm-a Italian you know"), 3) Merlin Olsen, 4) a guy who looks like Andy Kaufmann, and the list could go on.  Each one of these elements helped to allow for the MST3K writing team to just rip into the movie without remorse.  The fact the Mitchell as portrayed by Joe Don Baker was such a jerk, slob and lowlife meant that they didn't have to feel bad about pointing out those things.  They had carte blanche.For many MST fans, this episode was the last one they can watch, as it is Joel's final appearance.  For other fans, the episodes got better and better as they went on, even with Mike replacing the beloved Joel.  I actually tend to like the Mike episodes better on the whole, but I have no problem watching episodes from season 3 through 7 (before they jumped to Sci-Fi channel, andlost Trace Beaulieu) interchangeably.  With that said, I think this is by far the best Joel episode, and on par with Mike greats like Red Zone Cuba (619), High School Big Shot (618), and Escape 2000 (705).I think Joel's send off was appropriately done.  Many people may dispute that, but if he had to go, leaving on a box of hamdingers was a nice touch.

$review_text.: As much as I like Dark Shadows (and I am a BIG fan), I am disappointed in the DVD releases.  Having viewed the VHS video releases, I was eagerly awaiting the DVDs.  Sadly, after watching two different sets of DVD release number one, I found bad discs in both.  Player lock-up and picture skips spoil the fun.  I can't recommend Dark Shadows DVD purchases based on the first release.  Too many technology &quot;glitches&quot; are present.  MPI could do much better, and loyal fans deserve more reliability for their repeat business.

$review_text.: Leave well enough alone and stop this terribly embarassing trend of taking perfectly good and genuinely creepy Japanese horror films and watering them down into insipid and insulting wastes of celluloid.Really Grudge 2 was a really, really bad film

 I kind of liked the first Grudge remake although some of the original creepy scenes were replaced with less creepier scenes or left out altogether(the bathroom scene in the Japanese original was replaced with the stairwell scene, the night watchman scene and the TV scene at the house were completely left out, etc.) but Grudge 2 took it one step further and did their own thing and it wasn't good
How many times do we have to watch a girl in a dark creepy house hear a frightening noise, investigate it, see a ghost and then continue to wander around the house as if nothing happens? Not scary


How many times do we have to hear a character over explain what is happening as if we weren't paying attention to the movie ourselves?  Not scary
How many times do we have sit through a scene of sudden loud noises meant to scare us?  Not scary
 How many times do we have to watch a ghost chase down its victim only to find that when the victim turns around the ghost is gone?  Not scary


Not suspenseful

 Not original.The only interesting scenes in Grudge 2 are the opening sequence and the closing sequence

The ghost in the sweatshirt scene was pretty original


Outside of that, there are little to no scares, no suspense and nothing original
 The only disorienting aspect of this movie was the story being told out of order and what was the point of the dying mom in the bed? Yikes!  I can write a better horror movie than this.Hollywood I beg you please stop the insanity
 Leave well enough alone
 Hire some writers to come up with some fresh, cliche free, less-is-more scary movies and leave the J-horror alone
 Clearly the scares are lost in translation.

$review_text.: The movie has a pretty star studded cast.  Jeremy Piven (Entourage, Rush Hour 2, Smokin' Aces, Cars), Jon Favreau (Swingers, Iron Man, I Love You Man), David Spade (Tommy Boy, SNL, Rules of Engagement), Jessica Walter (Mother in Arrested Development) and Alex D&eacute;sert (Swingers, Becker).The movie is a tight 90 minutes about a Senior in High School (Tom Lawrence, played by Chris Young) who is visiting PCU (Port Chester University) for the day, because he is interested in attending.  Piven's character is signed up, as a prank, by a friend (Alex D&eacute;sert) to show around "the pre-frosh"(Tom) the School.  Piven is in a frat that is dwindling in numbers and has a bad rep.  The school, according to many of the characters, is drowning from being politically correct.  Piven, Young and D&eacute;sert cause some trouble and need to get some money to bail them selves out.The movie is the story of how they do it, things that stop them and has many different good themes, that if I tell you may give away too much of the plot.The movie is well written, has a lot of heart and has you understanding who the characters are without much explanation.  The movie is from 1994 and it shows, but doesn't take much away from it.  In the end, what you have is a funny, entertaining movie worth watching.  I recommend this movie for anyone who likes Piven or quirky, off beat comedies like Eurotrip.

$review_text.: Through the seller "Rightaway today" I received a six disc DVD set and was not at all disappointed with the quality. Probably bad timing though as I think it's now officially released a lot cheaper. The forerunner of all TV mini series it still holds up as the best ever produced. Nick Nolte as Tom could not have been better cast. I don't know what he is really like but it was as if he wasn't acting as his character was so convincing. Ed Azner played the kind of powerful support role like Burl Ives did in "A Big Country" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"Unlike so many other mini series, the story line has some depth and sends us a question of what success and happiness are all about. I also picked up before seeing it on someone else's reveiw,the blooper in filming the World Trade Center. That was built in 1973 well after the time frame of the story. This series I fully recommend as a definate collectors item.

$REVIEW.: This review is about a three disc set released as a collection of MFU MOVIES (special two TV episodes stitched iinto one and sold as MFU movies worlwide in the sixties
It' NOT about the whole Four seasons specially boxed set released later.)This package peatures five double-episodes of the series which were made into five full lenght movies for non US markets, and are available  here on a three discs DVD set.They are:- The Spy with My Face ("The Double Affair).- One Spy Too Many ("The Alexander The Great Affair")- The Karate Killers ("The  Five Daughters Affair")- The Helicopter Spies ("The Prince of Darkness Affair")- How to Steal the World (which was the series abrupt finale as the "The Seven Wonders of the World Affair).The discs come in a splendidly designed box with many production photos, it's really outstanding (not your regular "keep case" definitely).Only problem is, this particular DVD was released in the UK only, so it is REGION 3 (Europe) restricted and won't run on a non-multiregion DVD player


I got this DVD set through Amazon UK, no problem

If you have a multiregion DVD, you are ready


Otherwise, you can either get one which is what I suspect many fans are willing to do (being able to see many other Region 3 releases not available elsewhere), or get ready to wait forever to have The Man Fron U.N.C.L.E
DVD released for your region
Isn't this DVD "region" stuff the most idiotic thing they could've come up with?(This was solved by the later release of the full Series, including the individual, two part episodes that were made into film.)

$review_text.: I was surprised and amazed at how good this movie was after the first few minutes kicked in.  What started off as a loud, dancing "another boobie movie" turned out to be a fantastically shot and incredibly well paced old school action movie also with humor, horror, suspense and sensuality.  And believe it or not, all of the nudity is implied (there are no female frontal nude shots).  This makes it all the more interesting to have three "bad" ladies bursting out of their shirts along with the innocent cutie, and yet we're left to only imagine.  Great camera work and editing, bold acting and in-your-face directing.  I can't imagine anyone being bored if they really give this one a chance!  Classic!

$REVIEW.: The title makes you think this is a movie about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It is not. This is a movie about a couple of young fighter pilots that end up falling in love with the same woman. They just happened to be at Pearl Harbor when it got bombed. Even worse, Michael Bay does not use a lot of facts. He had our two main stars go on the mission to bomb Japan, when in reality the two pilots did not go.For most of the movie, it's just some stupid love story. One guy loves a girld. They think he dies, and the guy's friend decides to jump on her. Eventually, they find out the guy's not dead, and a fight gets out. That's most of the movie.Being the 141 million dollar film that it was, there are a lot of great angles, and very realistic CG effects, but not even that can save the film.Ben Affleck has got to be one of the worst actors ever. He's so dull. How the hell did he get the part? I know there are much better actors out there. Why did they get him?Overall, this movie is just not entertaining.I don't know if they like to tell kids this, but America cut off Japan's oil. All the kids at my high school didn't know that.I was there to see the filming at Pearl Harbor, and I could have been in it, but they didn't need me.

$REVIEW.: Perhaps it makes a difference watching something like this when your younger rather than older, but I watch plenty of kids films nowadays and like them. No, it's probably the fact that it's based onThe Dragon and the Georgeand got so many elements wrong that rubbed me the wrong way. That said, it's very LOOSELY based on the book. If you can walk into it while ignoring the fact that it's based on any book at all, it, like Starship Troopers, could be a relatively entertaining ride.Three stars for neither liking (due to prejudices) nor disliking (due to quality) it.

$review_text.: It's a musical showcasing unknown artists who perform songs in strange but inventive ways never  heard before. It's about their de facto representative, their rise to dizzying success as well as their many troubles and, in some cases, their fall to dreadful lows. It is about their struggles (and agent's maneuvering) to be heard on the radio and thereby sell their records. It's about life in the big city and race relations during times of segregation. It's about addiction. Clubs. Showbiz. Records. Radio. Payola. Loyalty. Flamboyance. Big houses and shiny, new cars. Fidelity and infidelity. Sex. Drugs. Even rock and roll. And, it's a true story. But, it's not "Dreamgirls." Nor is it "Ray." Or "La Bamba." Or even "Hustle & Flow." Although it does bear more than a little resemblance to those films and others of similar ilk.There are so many films of this type that there should be an actual name for this subgenre, one that sticks. This time around, the movie is called "Cadillac Records," a shiny, new vehicle written and directed by Darnell Martin. The storyline truly resembles so many other biographies about the rise of musical legends that it almost need not be explained here, but I'll devote the next three paragraphs to a brief summary, which you may feel free to read carefully, skim sporadically, or skip entirely.I'll bypass the typical backstory the movie features of unprivileged childhoods and young-adulthoods and cut to the chase. The "agent" is really music club proprietor-turned-record label owner Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody: "The Pianist"; "The Darjeeling Limited"), who firsts discovers a skeptical but talented Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright: "Syriana"; "Quantum of Solace") at his club in Chicago before it burns to the ground. Chess then takes a gamble by replacing the club with Chess Records, signing, as his first artist, Waters, a bluesman previously seen playing curbside, whose Southern upbringing influences the distinct sound of his music. Chess' group of new artists grows to include Muddy's harmonica-playing sidekick Little Walter (Columbus Short), personable and cavalier Chuck Berry (Mos Def, inhabiting his character with an appropriately humorous personality), affable songwriter Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer), imposing, lady-stealing Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and independent-minded Etta James (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, in a role with much similarity to her turn in "Dreamgirls" but better realized here). Also in the picture is Chess' devoted wife, Revetta (Emmanuelle Chriqui).All the artists and Chess himself would eventually go on to attain "hall of fame" status but, long before that, had to deal with life in and around the music biz (see the first paragraph), including rampant racial discrimination, which touches even the white-skinned Chess, merely for associating with African-Americans, whether or not they are top musicians whose tunes are copied by other bands, like the Beach Boys, almost verbatim. As Muddy says in the narration, the only time a Black man and a White man could be seen in a car together was if the Black man was driving. In another scene, Berry is thrown out of a club he is scheduled to perform in because, to the management's disbelief, he is not White, as seen in the club's poster portraying him as such. In times of crisis, Chess spends time repeatedly telling his performers that just because they sing the blues doesn't mean they must also live the blues.Why is the movie called "Cadillac Records" and not the more accurate "Chess Records"? Because, Chess made a point of giving each of his successful stars not only a fine house but a shiny, sleek Cadillac, complete with those 1950s tailfins, his own preferred make of dream car since the time he was a man struggling to open his club.The whole affair is a mix of drama, comedy and, yes, music. Plenty of music. The storyline is relatively predictable--we know the general arc of the story not necessarily because anything in Martin's script is a giveaway but because Hollywood film biographies of artists and entertainers tend, unfortunately, to follow similar paths, no matter which medium the artist worked in, or whether the movie concerns a single individual or a larger group, such as this film does. But, as was the case in another show business musical, "Dreamgirls," that fact does not impact on our enjoyment of the music itself. Fans of the music are in for a treat, and will undoubtedly pick up the film's soundtrack (though at my screening, I didn't notice any excitable members of the audience wildly applauding and cheering as when I saw "Dreamgirls," but no matter)."Cadillac Records" is much more low-key than "Dreamgirls" (more similar, perhaps, to "Ray"). Its cinematography and production design (by Anastas Michos and Linda Burton, respectively) are much less dazzling and flamboyant. And it is much less hyped. But it works reasonably well as a film, which, when making a movie, should be the first and foremost goal. Although it is not inspired enough to break away from the typical artist-biography path, it does tell its story better, is better directed, features better acting (Knowles included) and is better accomplished in terms of basic filmmaking technique (e.g., editing) than "Dreamgirls."Nevertheless, like any such musical, the standout feature is the fine music, the whole reason the film exists, crafted for fans and fans-to-be. But you knew that already, didn't you?

$REVIEW.: Is Kansas City Confidential a noir? Some critics think so. Some have even gone so far as to praise the movie. For me, the film is just one more B-level programmer, churned out in the thousands during the Forties and early Fifties to fill out double bills. The one thing it has going for it is a clever plot idea that combines a crime caper with a resentful Mr. Big who disliked being placed on forced retirement. Is that enough to take the premise seriously? I don't think so, but the way the payback for the retirement is planned and carried out isn't bad.The movie turns on two plot pivots. First is a bank heist. Three tough guys are recruited by Mr. Big, who wears a mask. He makes the others wear masks, too. Only Mr. Big knows who everyone is. Their getaway leaves behind an innocent patsy, Joe Rolfe (John Payne), a war hero who once got in trouble with the law. After the Kansas City police try to beat a confession out of him, they realize they have the wrong man and let him go. Joe gets mad and decides to track the robbers down.The second pivot centers on a small Mexican resort village where Mr. Big and the three accomplices have gathered, months later, to split the loot. Joe has taken the identity of one of them, Pete Harris. Joe had tracked Harris down and was forcing him to go together to the resort. By coincidence, Harris was gunned down by police at the Tijuana airport while Joe was at the ticket counter. Complicating things is Tim Foster (Preston Foster), a retired police captain from Kansas City who likes to fish, and his daughter, Helen (Coleen Gray). Helen, soon to pass her bar exam, showed up unexpectedly to visit her father. We're often reminded that there is a substantial reward for whoever captures the crooks and finds the money. There are beatings, slappings, double crosses, cold-blooded murder, noble sacrifice and a promised happy ending for Joe and Helen. A lot goes on, but it's something of a slog to get to Joe's and Helen's big kiss.Second bill programmers were most often noted for only adequate acting, workmanlike but often clunky scripts, music scores that telegraphed what we were supposed to be feeling and the barest budgets the studios could get away with. This didn't mean that the movies were bad, just that there needed to be something -- an occasional standout script, or a solid actor, or an unusual concept or mood -- to make the movie worth remembering. With Kansas City Confidential we have, to my way of thinking, just two things that stand out. First, is that clever plot idea. Second, are the actors who play the three goons recruited by Mr. Big. There's Neville Brand playing Boyd Kane. Kane is dumb and violent. Brand's tough features and rough voice make him believable. There's Lee Van Cleef as Tony Romano, smooth and sleazy...not a guy you'd want to leave your daughter alone with. And there's Jack Elam as Pete Harris, a sweaty chain smoker, a squirming coward unless he's holding the gun. With Harris, you can almost smell his cigarette breath and body odor. Elam really does a fine job. But then we have John Payne as the hero. Payne, in my opinion, was a handsome, colorless, reactive actor. He acts tough, but it's as phony as Robert Stack acting tough in House of Bamboo. While I doubt even Bogart or Cagney could do much with lines like this, "I know a sure cure for a nosebleed: a cold knife in the middle of the back," Payne just looks irritable when he says it. Coleen Gray doesn't help much; her job is to be perky and sympathetic, almost in spite of the dialogue: Says Joe Rolfe, "Look, you're a nice girl, but in case you're thinking of mothering me, forget it! I'm no stray dog you can pick up, and I like my neck without a collar. Now get lost!" Says Helen, "Now I'm supposed to be hurt. Maybe even cry. But I won't. I think you're in trouble, and I'm going to help you!"My advice: Watch it and learn what programmers were about. You might find you like it well enough. The film is in the public domain. The Image version is so-so; too dark and with too much contrast. It's not as bad as some public domain releases are. There are a few extras, including a cream-puff interview with Coleen Gray by noir specialist Eddie Muller. He also provides liner notes for an insert in the DVD case.

$REVIEW.: My 14 year old daughter watched the first episode and barely got through it
She found it overly dramatic, not true-to-life, and just flat out boring
I realize the children of today aren't easily entertained from shows from previous generations, especially with all the CGI's and technically enhanced advancements they see in current TV and movies, but she is open-minded and willing to try anything once

I would say this is for teens not looking forward to great television shows depicting real-life in relation to their own generation, or simply needing to just be entertained because there is nothing better to watch
Definitely a show that is more intended for teens from that era.

$REVIEW.: This true story is a Cold War-era spy thriller that switches over to a Hollywood satire and back with almost Sorkin-esque repartee throughout.  When our embassy in Tehran, Iran is stormed by Ayatollah Khomeini's followers, six staffers snuck out the back door and hid in the Canadian ambassador's house during the commotion.  The State Department keeps coming up with one bad idea after another on how to get them out, untilexfiltration expert Tony Mendez, after talking to his son on the phone about the kid's TV choices, hatches the only viable option: claim that the staffers are a Canadian film crew scouting locations for aStar Warsknockoff called "Argo."  As there's a Persian community in Los Angeles that could report back to Iran that no such production exists if one of their relatives called to check, this requires the enlistment ofStar Trekmakeup technician John Chambers to build up an elaborate cover legend of not only the production company but also the requisite press publicity to make it all plausible...and all while the Revolutionary Guard are going door-to-door executing anyone who is saying nice things about the US.Simultaneously tense and hilarious, this dramatization of this audacious black op that earned Mendez the CIA's answer to the Medal Of Honor and had to be kept classified in order to prevent retaliation against the hostages they already held is definitely worthy of all its critical accolades.  The recovering Tom Clancy fanboy in me enjoyed the old-school spycraft angle, and the Hollywood power player-in-waiting in me reveled in the portions in LA where Mendez, Chambers and the producer they enlist to make it plausible wheel, deal and scam their way to that end, such as staging an in-costume table read for the benefit of the press just to have something in the trades that the Iranians could look at.  It all puts to rest the GOP's claims that Hollywood hates America.
$SUMMARY.: Argo buy it ASAP

$review_text.: I had read the book Rosemary's Baby many years before actually seeing this movie.  As in most cases, the book is far superior because it's a different experience than seeing a movie version.  Had this movie been made today it would have been far more gorey and graphic, but this has very much an old school horror mentality of suspense.  Sometimes the best horror situation is knowing that there is something wrong, just beyond your reach, just past your field of vision, and it's coming for you.  The growing sense of paranoia and mounting fear can make anyone cring.In her most famous role, Mia Farrow plays Rosemary, a sweet, somewhat neive housewife who has just moved into a new apartment with her husband, Guy (John Castavettes).  While they are adjusting to their new surroundings, they are befriended by an elderly couple and their friends in the building.  They seem very interested in Rosemary and their impending plans on starting a family.  Unknown to Rosemary, Guy discovers that these seemingly harmless old people are a coven of Satanists and he makes a pact with them for his own success.  When Rosemary discovers that she is pregnant, she is carrying the devil's child.Suspense begins to build as her neighbors seem overly excited and eager to help her along.  They even go so far as to hire a top notch OBGYN, Dr. Sapperstein, and Minnie makes and feeds her a special herbal drink everyday.  Rosemary accepts their generosity as being overly friendly and somewhat lonely, but begins to suspect something's not right.  Her concerns about her pain are dismissed, her husband is oddly cold and detached from the whole situation, and it all seems a little too weird.  Rosemary is going to unknowingly have the devil's child which they will be caring for after they do away with her.Mia Farrow seems to play her part a bit too well in her relationships with other men in this movie, as in real life she played the hippiesque, neo-Lolita to a lot of older men (Frank Sinatra, Woody Allen, Andre Previn, etc.) like she did with Hutch, Dr. Sapperstein, Roman, and even her husband in some reguards.  In those days it was more acceptable if not uncommon for a woman to be somewhat childlike and dependent, but had this movie been made now she would have more resourceful and aggressive with others.  Her sense of paranoia is very believable, as she realizes everyone really REALLY is out to get her and she has no where to turn to.  Even her one friend who really got it, Hutch, is victim to their evil but tries to warn her by leaving her the books on witches.This is a Roman Polanski movie, who always seemed to have the hook for an impending sense of doom.  When we reach the much anticipated finale, we never see the child with his father's eyes.  We only hear a baby cry, knowing that this is the beast in that craddle.  That's the real horror, not seeing the devil's child when you are so so close.  *Shudder*

$REVIEW.: The thing about &#34;Drive Angry&#34; is that you cannot go in expecting a lot. This is not a masterpiece, this is a dirty, silly, campy little movie that celebrates Grindhouse and other B movies. If you happen to love that style of movies (I grew up on that genre) it's a fun movie. Sure it's kind of a bummer to watch Nicolas Cage scrapping the bottom of the barrel given the fact that he was once on of the finest actors of his generation but at least with &#34;Drive Angry&#34; you get the sense that he's at least in on the joke. Amber Heard, well she kind of serves her purpose as the pretty and snarky sidekick. She's serviceable but if this was a better movie she'd leave a lot to be desired. She's not the world's most gifted actress- let's put it that way.  Billy Burke is quiet a lot of fun as one of the baddies and William Fichtner as usual steals most of his scenes. &#34;Drive Angry&#34; is a good movie if you don't put a lot of expectations on it. Just watch and enjoy and try your hardest to suspend disbelief, you'll have a good time.
$SUMMARY.: Pretty good B Gridhouse style movie

$REVIEW.: CURSED is the story of a brother and sister who are attacked by a werewolf and become infected.  Prior to this incident, Ellie's (Christina Ricci) biggest problems were an emotionally distant boyfriend and a snotty PR representative at her company, while Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg) mostly had to put up with the homophobic bullies at his high school.  I guess sometimes we just don't know when we have it good.  Jimmy, a comic book geek, is quick to accept the possibility of what has happened to them and begins research immediately, while Ellie remains skeptical until the physical evidence becomes irrefutable.With Wes Craven's track record (even his lesser films at least dealt with more original subject matter) one had to wonder why he wanted to make such a formulaic movie about such a well-worn concept.  [Edit: I have since learned that this movie was a result of contractual obligation.]  The first act of the movie felt quite tired, with dozens of unimaginative scares that have been seen time and time again.  A dream sequence in particular is a real groaner.  However, it actually does get better as it goes on.  While it still retains an air of predictability, it did surprise me at times.  I really thought it was obvious who the lycanthropic antagonist was.  I wasn't completely wrong, but I wasn't exactly right, either.In the end, CURSED is a passably entertaining movie made so primarily by the cast, which also includes Joshua Jackson (THE SAFETY OF OBJECTS) and Judy Greer (ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT).  Portia de Rossi (also ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT) appears in a small role, and Scott Baio appears as himself.  As a bonus, we get to see Shannon Elizabeth (JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK) get ripped in half.  Always a treat.The unrated DVD contains a number of featurettes: a making-of with cast interview clips, one on effects, one on editing, and a humorous short film on "making a werewolf."  There is also effects commentary for certain scenes.

$REVIEW.: I read Cameron Crowe's Fast Times at Ridgemont High when I was in High school, and this was at a time when I usually didn't read books.  It flowed very easily and told a good story.  This can also be said of Almost Famous.The Director's edition is worth the extra money.  It has the theatrical version as well as an extended Director's cut, which I found worthwhile.  They're both good movies, but the director's cut spends more character time and I like the characters enough that I will probably watch the longer version by default.This one lives up to the billing as a Special Edition.  It not only has two versions, but great commentary by Crowe and his actual mother.  Crowe's mother only had one criticism of the mother character in the movie, and it was surprising what she chose to dislike.Other extras include Cameron's picks as top of albums of 1973, some short vintage interviews with Lester Bangs, a CD of Stillwater music, some rehearsal footage and other tidbits.

$review_text.: This is a recommendable "Pelleas et Melisande," but it doesn't measure up to the one conducted by Pierre Boulez (on Deutsche Grammphon). This Glyndebourne production is splendidly conducted by Andrew Davis, but it has several drawbacks. The opera is supposed to take place in and around an old castle, but this staging replaces the castle with an Edwardian mansion, which wouldn't be so bad except that the whole opera is taken indoors. You get no sense of the grounds outside the house. The forest, the park with the little well, the grotto by the sea--all these scenes lose half their charm by being set indoors. On the plus side, this production ends on a high note. The final scene, which can be slow and underwhelming in some productions, is effectively done here--quite dramatic.The cast is a bit uneven. John Tomlinson delivers a powerful performance as Golaud, Gwynne Howell is splendid as old King Arkel, and young Jake Arditti is the best Yniold I've heard. But Richard Croft as Pelleas, while not bad, sings with a noticeably non-French accent. He's just unconvincing. Likewise, Oelze makes a fine Melisande, but she simply can't match Alison Hagley from the Boulez production.The Boulez is also a better sound recording, and a finer quality DVD experience in terms of the menu options, booklet, etc. I recommend it over the Glyndebourne in almost every respect. Still, this Glyndebourne "Pelleas et Melisande" makes a strong second choice, worth it for Davis' sublime conducting, Tomlinson's excellent Golaud, and Howell's nobly sung Arkel.

$REVIEW.: You remember &#34;Barbarella&#34; as a sexy little camp classic, don't you


A bygone relic, a knowingly funny gem featuring an adorable, scantily-clad Jane Fonda and ridiculous special effects.You're probably better off not watching it again.It starts well
Turns out you were right about Fonda


She's beautiful, sexy, and has a too-good-for-this-mess intelligence about her that, at times, carries the movie
And it feels like a naughty pleasure to watch this version, which features enough nudity (including Ms

Fonda's) to warrant a soft R rating
But after the first 20 minutes, you're treated to slow-moving scenes featuring mostly wooden, joyless actors

You get a villain who's both unpleasant and rather dull - even in his hysterical, over-the-top final scene
You notice an odd sense of ennui, as if the actors were stuck doing overtime again


And you get an ending that doesn't really resolve anything


When it's over, it's just sort of...over.There are nice touches, some hilariously bad songs (featuring some of the most out-of-tune singers ever recorded), and a few bits of psychedelia that will please the trippers among you

And there's Fonda, gamely making the best of it while showing off her lovely body

But if you want a TRUE guilty, dated campy pleasure, you're much better off tracking down Beyond the Valley of the Dolls or Flash Gordon (or, hell, the possibly superior Flesh Gordon)
&#34;Barbarella&#34; may be camp, but I'm afraid it's no classic.

$review_text.: The extravagant l967 blockbuster certainly did not disappoint the droves of movie enthusiasts who packed theaters to see the rugged,ragged, raunchy behind the scenes classic based on  Jacqueline Susann's bestseller:a gaudy jumble of familiar backscene dramae which sweetened the plot by supposedly inserting real-life slices from infamous motion picture icons. All involved  really faired well, but especially veteran Academy Award winner Susan Hayward. With three scenes only, she fleshed out the most interesting character in the infamous novel. She brought in all her tried and true tough broad techniques and emerged triumphant. Too bad , she didn't at least receive a last nod from the academy for the performance she graciously received from first pick Judy Garland.Miss Hayward's last scene is a veritable drama course for aspiring, serious actors.
