$REVIEW.: Regardless of the opinions of this cut, there seems to be some confusion of what this version of the movie is supposed to be. The Donner cut is supposed to give you a rough idea of what Donner's Superman II would have been like had he not been fired. It is not a replacement of the theatrical version, for  it is far too incomplete for that. The ending to this Superman II is redundant to the first because he originally intended it for part II, then moved it to Part I and planned to have a new ending for II. He didn't get to do that, so they put his original ending back into part II, so they could show his ending footage that follows up his time reversal. Remember, the idea is to show all of Donner's footage while minimalizing Lester's footage, not create a definitive version of the movie. In my mind, a definitive version would be some of this version combined with the ABC extended edition that was aired years ago.Finally, this edition was not a marketing gimmick at all. The entire reason this version was released was due to years of requests from fans to see Donner's footage (see the intro on the DVD).I am 100% sure that if Donner had never been fired, his version would have been the best. As it is, don't throw out your theatrical DVD (unless they release the extended cut), but be sure to pick up this version as well.

$REVIEW.: Wes Craven stuck his name on this film even though he didn't direct it. Sometimes I like Wes Craven films, sometimes I don't. This time I really didn't. I liked the opening scene when the boy is hiding under the covers from the monster coming out of the closet. It led me to believe I was going to watch a truly scary film. But once into the film, it was predictable, badly acted, and just plain typical. I have seen all of this before. Childhood friends reuniting in their adulthood and having one thing in common, being traumatized as a child by a spook. Don't go in the dark because there are monsters there, and the monsters can't come into the light. This idea was just used in DARKNESS FALLS. I even got up to get something to eat without pausing the DVD, I just let it play on. I did enjoy the alternate ending much better than the one that was used. I won't spoil what the alternate ending is, but it would have made this movie much more original had it been the real ending.My opinion: Not memorable at all, not a film I will go back and watch again.

$review_text.: Vinnie Jones is Danny "Mean Machine" Meehan, former star soccer player, who was once hired to promote the sports goods of first-rate company Umbro.  But now drunk and disgraced, he is in jail, doing his time of three-year sentence.  But the governor there, himself deep in debt, wants him to go back to the game (between wards and prisoners), AND lose it on purpose, just like Danny did in the international match between England and Germany.Sounds familiar?  Sure, the film's opening credits show that "Mean Machine" is actually based on Burt Reynolds's film "The Longest Yard."  You may say, or groan, "Not again!," but be assured, this new one is surprisingly good, considering that Vinnie Jones's career as actor has just got started.  And his fans, be proud; though he may not be nominated for BAFTA awards, his turn as the first-time lead is really good, and convincing.The virtue of "Mean Machine" is that the film looks very authentic.  That's no surprise, you say, because Vinnie Jones was a professional soccer player, but keep in mind that he had to shape up his body again to fit in the role as it has been pretty long since he had retired.  As I'm a huge soccer fan, and watch Euporean games live on cable TV in Japan, I can tell you this, but the players of "Mean Machine" team are good at playing soccer, and the most remarkable thing is that they play so well  that their movements in the game is authentic (except for the goal keeper, who likes keep the ball too much), and look very real, if not as good as those you see in English Premier games.  On top of that, most scenes are shot in real prison, The Oxford Prison, now disused for years.But the greatest find is Vinnie Jones, who is natural and sometimes even humorous.  He is much better than ill-used role in "Swordfish," and the director knows how to use his tough-guy persona on the screen.  The film keeps a good speed, and the supports are also effective, such as veteran actor David Kelly ("Greenfingers," another prison drama, and "Waking Ned Divine").  And for the soccer fans (and players), Vinnie's lecture on "How to Commit Foul Plays" is very funny, alarmingly.Overall the film is a drama, and some of the scenes are very serious, but the film doens't stop there too long.  Predictable you may call it, but I still find it fun to watch.  You may too, especially when you like soccer like me.
$SUMMARY.: Enjoyable Prison Drama with Vinnie Jones in Good Form

$REVIEW.: When I first heard of the show on Discovery Channel, I thought it was another reality show gimick.  But the show is actually very entertaining and enlightening.  Les Shroud gets dropped off in some remote place with some camera gear and has to survive on his own for 7 days.  He really puts you right there with him.  The shows are generally about him building a shelter, making a fire and finding food.  He uses some random stuff that his production crew has planted in his kit, but otherwise, it's just him and mother nature.  Looking forward to Survivorman, season 2.

$REVIEW.: I'd read a lot of reviews about this one before seeing it. A lot of the complaints, such as the percentage of team involvement in the caper, are unjustified. Why give characters more screen time if it doesn't advance the story?It was enjoyable enough, if a little long, but the snappy dialogue makes the journey fun, the plot is interesting, and the master burglar's laser-avoiding dance is amazing. The team dynamic is intact from the first movie, and there are quite a few plot twists you don't see coming.

$REVIEW.: First off, ANYTHING with Tom Baker is good.  END OF DISCUSSION.  Those who pan the episode are totally off base.  Of course the sets and the costumes have flaws!  They ALWAYS have flaws.  It's the BBC for crying out loud.  Overall it's a great story and it's one of my favorites, probably because of all the humor.  You get the feeling that they just had a lot of fun with this one.  The tax men are appropriately wacky (in a bureaucratic way), Tom has innumerable funny quips that go by so fast you sometimes have to rewind to get them, and the "silly" scene at the end where he hams it up fighting with the monsters was just ... well, fun to watch.Other people have given a good synopsis of the plot so I won't repeat it.  There's a reason why copies of this episode sell for so much.  It's a great Dr. Who story.  You don't critique Dr. Who episodes by judging the sets and costumes.  You look at the characters, the acting, and the overall story.  In this case, I liked everything.  The characters all had a lot of personality, they were all well acted, and the story was unique and very well done.  A terrific Dr. Who!

$review_text.: Is it possible for one's brain cells to commit suicide? Is it possible for an IQ to drop in the matter of an hour and a half? I have pondered these and other mysteries of life in watching Charlie's Angels. The "angels" if that's what you would term the three scantily clad, bubbly women, truly fall from grace in this movie. The idea of three women kicking butt and saving the day is appealing, but must they do so only by looking sexy and stupid in the process. The martial arts sequences, if that's what you would call them, do little to actually kick butt. The plot, as in the second movie, (yes I was a masochist and forced myself to watch the second movie to see if an redeeming qualities exist)is severly lacking...Angelic...no they are not...With three recognizable and at least somewhat talented actresses it is surprizing that the movie could dizzy that far down into stupid, predictable and brainless

$REVIEW.: I used to think that there were a couple of absolutes in this world other than the standard issue ones. One is that I will always hate Andrew Lloyd Webber and another is that Madonna will never be a good actress. After seeing Alan Parker's 1996 musical "Evita" however, starring Madonna and featuring the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, I have had to amend those two statements slightly."Evita" is a gorgeous, lush film, full of thousands of extras, great location scenes and features a very talented cast. It acts almost as an incredibly big budgeted and elaborate music video, mainly because it features almost constant singing, and well, it stars one of the most visible music video stars of all time. Madonna finally found her part in this film, and no, it wasn't just easier because she didn't have a lot of speaking lines. It is clear that not only did she take voice lessons (which actually is true) because her voice quality was better than "normal", and has stayed that way since the making of this film, but she was able to knock off some decent dramatic moments. Banderas, though he spent a lot of the film looking pretty furious with the camera, doesn't have to prove any acting mettle (anyone who has seen him in an Almodovar film can attest to this) but did come up with a surprisingly good singing voice. Jonathan Pryce, who was curiously cast as Peron also did a good job, though his part was fairly minor, and even at that he was relegated to giving Evita a lot of loving looks. It's a slick production, some catchy music (I cannot believe I am actually saying that I actually really like a film featuring the music of the insipid, mainstream, gnome-like Webber) that is good enough to listen to extracurricularly and performances that weren't bad made for a pretty good and very entertaining viewing. Don't get me wrong - there are more than a few eye-rolling moments in "Evita", but the good definitely outweighs the bad, exponentially. The story, while coherent, was pretty mediocre, and I found that I felt that there were some things that were glossed over or trivialized with a cute musical number. I also have to add that Madonna in the beginning of the movie did look too old to be in her late teens.Admittedly, however, this IS a musical and you don't sign up for a hard-hitting knowledge fest when you watch one. This wasn't the first time I had seen this film, and yet I still end up getting so wrapped up in the action that I end up bawling a couple of times, and this viewing was no exception. While this hasn't made me a Madonna fan, I do hold her in higher esteem after seeing this film. I recommend this film for musical lovers and for those who simply appreciate great cinema.

$REVIEW.: Adapted from Truman Capote's novella, Edwards's fleet-footed romantic comedy would not be the cultural touchstone it is without the effervescent presence of Hepburn. As Holly Golightly, a small-town Texas girl with her feet planted firmly in the glitz of New York's party scene, Hepburn is irrepressibly charming, a vision of elflike beauty in Givenchy and pearls. But she is also a frail creature harboring secrets, and Hepburn plays both sides exquisitely. Peppard is solid and likable as writer Paul, Holly's admirer and confidante, while Patricia Neal chews on her steely role as Paul's wealthy older mistress. A chic, iconic romance, memorably set to the Oscar-winning strains of Henry Mancini's "Moon River."

$review_text.: Directed by Rob Zombie (of course, not real name of Robert Cummings), 'House of 1000 Corpses" became an instant cult, like 'Rocky Horror Show.'  See this one as such ... kind of a film that is full of campy, very campy fun.The plot is, as you know, similar to 'Texas Chainsaw Massaccre.'  The four hapless (and stupid, you say) students driving a car at a deserted courtryside find themselves trapped in the wrong place, like, the house where killers dwell.  This is no secret from the beginning.Interesting part is its cast: you see Sid Haig with painted face like clown, who organizes a 'murder ride' at his own house, but that's just a beginning.  You see Bill Morsley (yes, that's him in 'Texas Chainsaw 2'!), Irwin Keyes, Michael J Pollard, and oh! no! that's Karen Black too!  Hey, you might not remember this, but she is an Oscar nominee!  Plus, many, many dead bodies, some of them making us very sick.Still, the film is not scary.  That doesn't mean it has no merit for us to watch.  But the fact that it has borrowed the central plot from 'Texas Chainsaw Massaccre' is so obviously felt, and the film is shot with too much MTV-style visuals, and I found the film dazzling (and intriguing) at first, then boring, especially the latter half.I'm sorry if I offend you, but ... is it worth our wait?  I know some people loved the film, making this film a surprise hit.  I know Rob Zombie loves horror films, and made a lot of references to the genre (and the title is a 1974 film 'The House of Seven Corpses.'  Sid Haig and other actors are funny to see ... sort of, and as far as we see its opening, Rob has a talent to make a good film.  But I need something more, something besides what makes this film a cult film.

$REVIEW.: Assumptions, assumptions. We think we know people, we all have our ideas of 'stereotypes' or judge a person within five minutes of meeting them, and then 'Crash!', those judgements come down in these types of movies. The cast was fantastic and the story-line a wonderful way to say 'it only takes a little twist of fate for a hero to turn villian, or a villian to turn into a hero'. An angry man can turn kind, and a patient man can be pushed to his limits, suddenly appearing to be a madman. A great lesson in how wrong our perceptions of personality are at times.

$review_text.: I have watched this movie via home video three times now and find something new to like about it each time. Released in 1991, this movie is based on an early novel of the same title by Ian McEwan so we are fairly sure from the outset that the characters won't all live happily ever after. Set in Venice and beautifully filmed, the movie is directed by Paul Schrader; the screenplay is written by Harold Pinter so we're obviously not dealing with slouches here.There are only four characters in the movie, all of whom do commendable acting jobs: Rupert Everett, Natasha Richardson, Christopher Walken and Helen Mirren. Everett's good looks sometimes get in the way of his acting-- at least for me-- that does not happen here, however. A lot of appropriate adjectives fit this movie: sinister, scary, shocking, compelling, mysterious, sexually ambiguous, suspenseful. I do not know how much time this movie got in theatres, but it is a very fine movie indeed. It is certainly an artistic success and ought to have had a wide viewing.This movie reminded me of both DEATH IN VENICE from the Thomas Mann novel and DON'T LOOK NOW. Another beautiful movie filmed in this otherwordly beautiful city about death and dying and/or horror.

$review_text.: A relatively large collection of wrestling matches and promos during the decade of 1980's from the WWE. 15 wrestlers are featured in 3 seperate DVD's with Mean Gene Okerlund setting up the intros to a short bio piece on each superstar. Although short, the bios are effective in setting up the importance of each wrestler during the decade.One thing that grates on my nerves a bit is the fact that the WWE changes(or edits out) the original entrance songs. JYD used to come out to "Another one bites the dust" all the time-now it's "Grab them cakes"(which is lame). For a short period in 1984, the Hulkster used "Eye of the Tiger" as his entrance theme. Now those are all edited out. Oh well.Overall this is very nice collection of wrestling nostalgia for those who grew up in the 1980's watching this stuff. Aside from the then-WWF stuff, you also get matches(and promos/interviews) from the AWA, NWA, and Mid-Atlantic regions. Of course there were other very influential wrestlers from the 80's that could easily fill up a volume 2 of this collection. Nonetheless, an enjoyable collection.

I felt very sorry for all people in this film.  There are no heroes in this film, just victims.  Tom Wilkinson gives the performance of his career as the father.  An Oscar worthy performance.  Sissy Spacek gives her finest performance since, "Coal Miner's Daughter" as the mother.  Both characters are complex as we try to figure out what's next.  This film is not fast paced and I guess you can fault Hollywood for force-feeding us a conventional movie formula.  This is a very good case study on grief, regret and the consequenses of actions.

We could only bare 30 minutes of it before fast-forwarding to the climax of the movie where absolutely nothing happens. People love this movie though. And real people too, like friends of my parents and adults who have college degrees. Anyway, if you've never seen it- don't rent it. I thought the movie Pluto Nash or &quot;Black Night&quot; starring Martin Lawrence was better. I guess Lost in Translation is supposed to be like real life (Depending on whether or not you're an emo nerd), but people don't pay to see movies like real life. They want to escape the mediocrity of their boring life and see planes firing missles at each other and a tarantula devoruing something living. Why would I want to spend two hours watching someone else's boring life? I don't know. People who like the movie Lost in Translation know.

David Lean and co. weave a visual and emotional phantasm that is true to the novel, yet compact and,  well, lean. The images of the film shimmer in one's memory and allow the  page upon rereading to fill even fuller. The love and respect for the  writer is everywhere, unlike the recent remake that goes so idiotically out  of control. I also recommend Lean's &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, and the more  recent &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;, which is interminably long, but worth it.

The music is fabulous, but the plot is episodic, with a clear objective to  please the audience at the expense of artistry. The technical style of  certain scenes is stunning, but they also vary tremendously in quality  throughout the movie. Overall, the film deserves to be seen and loved, but  it's definitely not a masterpiece and does not deserve to be known as one  of De Palma's dreatest achievements.

$review_text.: You'll immediately see why this movie wasn't up for any Academy Awards but if you want to just sit back, relax and have some good laughs......see this movie


The fact that most of the movie was filmed in places I'm very familiar with goes a long way with me, too
Chevy Chase is great at the dreamer who longs for life in the country and while the &#34;Vermonters&#34; don't always ring true, it's still a feel-good, easy-going move


Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: This movie is "ghastly". The directors "The Brothers Strause"( 2 brothers who never directed a feature film before) attempted to make a more "intense" AVP film, however this one fails terribly. The story, as other reviewers have stated, is a "teen slasher" drama. Honestly I don't know how this film even made it to theatres. The film is clich&eacute; ridden and has no discernible story except for the high school aged pizza delivery boy and his blonde love interest; which gave the film an odd out of place Dawson's Creek feel. All the characters are stiff and ambiguous. Also, the playing up of the US Army soldier mother returning from her deployment does not even remotely have the impact the writers must have intended her character to have; it is very tongue in cheek. Many concepts in this film are very forced and clich&eacute;d. The film's setting was a poor choice (worse than Antarctica), and the supposed "infestation" of aliens in the town is completely unseen, there are neither illustrative scenes nor action sequences to allude to the scope of the invasion, so the viewer feels no impact at all.The Alien/Predator creatures are designed to be more "classic" in appearance, though this is a noble effort to make a more realistic film, the over exposure of the creatures only demystifies them more.  The Predator and Alien relied upon their mysterious nature in previous films to make them more frightening. The mystery is gone and the creatures end up as unpleasant background characters. This film takes the already not-so-awesome leftovers from the first AVP film and tries desperately to synthesize them with a teen drama. It is a teenage gore fest. If 1997's Alien Resurrection was the diagnosis of a terminal illness for the ALIEN franchise, 2004's AVP was its death, then 2007's AVPR was its shameful death rattle. All in all, this film is just a mistake that I'm sure 20th Century Fox wishes they could simply erase.

$REVIEW.: Have not seen this film since I was a boy growing up in the 1960's and always wanted to own it.  The story is great and so is the acting. My biggest disappointment as a boy when you see the shot of the new planet from the ship as the film ends, is that I wanted to see more.  The matte work is beautiful and so is the miniture work.  Rates pretty much up there with anything coming out of Hollywood today in terms of special effects and property work.  A few scenes have some light flaws, such as when the rocket ship takes off, but they had us kids convinced back then the whole thing was real.  Lots of fun to watch: Intense!Cover and DVD quality are fine: No complaints.  Purchase price for the quality is fine: Again, no complaints.  Glad to have it in my library and thanks Amazon for offering it!

$review_text.: This movie makes you realize how wasted Ewan McGregor is in the Star Wars movies.  This guy can act!  And anyone who watched "The Deep End" or "Adaptation" already knows what an amazing actress Tilda Swinton is.  Her performance in "Young Adam" is her best yet.....truly powerful in it's understatement.  She makes being a frumpy Scottish working class mother seem pretty darn sexy!  I had not seen Emily Mortimer before, and I was very impressed with her as well.There is a lot of sex in Young Adam.  I suppose my only gripe about the film is that most of the sex is rather manic.  Why is movie sex always so frantic and noisy?  I suppose directors don't think audiences want to see real sex.  Or they don't think it will make a good movie.Anyway, I'm not complaining too much.  The sex scenes in Young Adam are still a lot better than we get in American films.  There is one particularly fun scene that will remind you of "9 1/2 weeks".But really, this film is a powerful meditation on the nature of love and rejection.......life-changing decisions and regret..............the things we make happen versus the things that just happen to us.The cinematography is fantastic.  David Byrne did the score and I didn't even notice it, which is the way it should be.This one's a keeper.

$REVIEW.: Warner's idea of continuing to produce large budget town taming Westerns was something of a myth by the time this film was released in 1950

The idea was old and the film even looks older than it is because of it save for the John Twist's script and Stuat Heisler's direction

The film's opening shootout was a clever piece of scripting and the idea of Gary Cooper and Leif Erickson switching identities is well executed


These are good techniques that enhance the characters but not the plot
The basic premise of cleaning up a Western town is still filmed with very little innovation in standard pre-1950 Hollywood style.

$review_text.: Chances are good that most of us in our 40s and 50s have unpleasant memories of Sunday School.  Of all my own distasteful memories, the very worst are the hokey illustrations in the kids Bible we used to read.  Remember them?  The kind of drawings that still appear in Jehovah's Witness literature that depict Jesus and Joseph and Mary as clean-cut suburban types dressed in bathrobes?  That stylized 1950s look, in which Jesus and his disciples look like cleancut college boys, turned me off of religion for years.  Even now, I cringe when I come across examples of it.That's why I cringed when I watched &quot;The Judas Project.&quot;  A good concept--a twentieth-century Christ--but an unspeakably bad presentation.  The music is horrible pop evangelism, banged out on a piano, with insipid lyrics.  The dialogue is wooden, with contemporary cool talk mashed together with quotations from the King James that make little sense.  The acting is one-dimensional and stereotypical; even veteran character actor Jeff Corey, who plays the twentieth-century version of Caiaphas, is atrocious, looking as if he's been drugged and then dragged to the set.  The camera work is amateurish; in one scene, where Judas and Jesse (the Christ figure) are in an animated conversation at a cafe table (with a rather stupid Peter wordlessly looking on), the camera lights are so close and so hot that the faces of the two speakers become beaded with sweat.  The Mount Tabor transfiguration scene is pure kitsch masquerading as piety.  In short, the movie started out bad, and just got worse and worse.  As a piece of art, it's embarrassing.  As an apologetic, it's off-putting--just like being in Sunday School again!This isn't to say the film is a total failure.  It does have moments when it almost rises to the occasion.  The central dilemma introduced in the film--the way of love and powerlessness represented by the Christ figure, and the way of worldly domination and power represented by the Judas figure--is important and timely.  But it's barely scratched, and even then seems like a leftover from the Judas-Jesus conflict in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (an infinitely better movie, by the way).  The crucifixion scene, which takes place in an abandoned barn, has great cinemagraphic potential.  But the camera person blows it again, failing to take advantage of the possibilities.St. Paul says that when we grow up, it's time to put away the things of childhood.  Too true.  So let me encourage readers of this review to skip this Sunday School caricature and go straight to some adult cinematic explorations of Christ.  Denys Arcand's &quot;Jesus of Montreal&quot; or even Mel Gibson's recent and controversial &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; would be good places to start.

$review_text.: Let me tell you what you get when you buy this movie:  We start with a mental patient escaping from a hospital.  This takes about 1 minute, as the nurse walks into his room, the lights are out, and someone grabs her.  Okay, then we get the longest thrash metal song ever recorded.  A really generic thrash metal song.  While this thing plays and plays and plays, we watch feet walking down the street.  For about two minutes.  Then we watch an elevator door open and close while the opening credits are displayed.  This takes probably 8 - 10 minutes.  Then we're lucky enough to watch the camera go around in a circle over a bunch of garbage laying on a floor.  And the thrash metal song still plays!  Congratulations movie makers, this marks the first time I've hit the fast forward button withing the first two minutes of a movie.Then we meet our characters.  The guys are basically dirtbags, and so are the girls.  A couple of the girls are quite well endowed, which is about the only good thing in this whole movie.  Even though they all look to be in their mid-late twenties, we're apparently supposed to believe that they're too young to buy alcohol, so we waste some time as they discuss how they're going to get alcohol and then we waste some more time actually watching one guy standing outside a liquor store trying to talk somebody into buying beer for them.Anyhow...they eventually arrive at this building where they're going to do some partying.  It's under renovation, so nobody lives there.  Oh, except for the slasher.  The "kids" go up to the roof and we get another thrash metal video.  At least the photography is nice this time, the cameraman zooms in on the girls' chests quite a bit.  Then we waste some more time as they play with a Ouija board (one girls spends a while talking about how dangerous it is), and it spells out "death".  Oh yeah, now we're terrified.  A couple wander off for a makeout session, and the slasher kills them in a pretty routine manner.  I have to say, there is a fair bit of scary atmosphere when they're wandering around inside the dark building.  Unfortunately, it's too little and way too late to help this movie much.Another couple wanders off and gets killed in another pretty boring scene, then the others meet a crazy lady who explains the killer's motives to them.  This scene is pretty laughable actually.  They're running for their lives but stop to chat with a crazy lady, lol.  The showdown between the killer and the last survivor is pretty good actually, I'll give them credit for that.  Okay, now the movie's pretty much over, but we get another music video, a completely pointless surprise, and then ten solid minutes of closing credits.  Whew, I think we can almost call this a movie now!Overall, crummy characters, so much padding it'll have you fast forwarding within five minutes of putting in the DVD, no plot whatsoever - even for a slasher - and a small amount of good atmosphere.  A small amount of T&A;, and some boring deaths.  It's not the worst thing I've seen lately, but it's in the ballpark.

$REVIEW.: After the horrible films entitled Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut, I decided to give Tom Cruise another chance, after all his preformance in Top Gun was first rate. None the less although as an actor Tom is pretty good, he choses the worst movies to play in! Take this one for example, Vanilla Sky is by far the worst movie I've seen in a long time! I watched it for free and still asked for my money back, I havent seen the original forign film to actually compare, only by word of mouth, but from what I've been hearing this movie does the original no justice!Of all the people who've rented this movie since it came out, and there's been a lot, I have found only one person to have anything at all nice to say about it. Of corse if you are the type to like movies that you sit through for two or more hours and come out having no clue what you just watched, then you'll probably love this flick!That, however is all this movie is, one big mass of chaos and confusion that makes no sence what so ever, even after they attempt to explain it all in the end. Anyone who wants to watch this film, I suggest you be sure that you are being paid to watch it, and not you paying to watch it, otherwise you are just wasting your hard earned money on a pile of junk!

$REVIEW.: Thus reasoned young bushwhacker Jake Roedel, (Tobey Maguire) summing up the condition of his native Missouri, torn apart by savage guerilla warfare, as neighbor fought and killed neighbor during the Civil War. This outstanding movie manages to take much the same attitude as it tells the tale of this troubling period that has usually been handled in a much more partisan manner.The Civil War in Missouri was particularly terrible, as the loyalties and interests of the population split between the Union and the Confederacy. Few regular troops were committed to Missouri, and most of the fighting was done by roving gangs of Irregulars; Secessionist Bushwhackers and Unionist Jayhawkers. These men more often made war on those who once had been their neighbors and friends than on uniformed troops, and terrible atrocities that were more murder than war were committed by each side.`Ride with the Devil' is an incredibly thoughtful and nuanced telling of this sad story. All of the protagonists are bushwhackers, but the movie does not attempt to paint them as pure heroes fighting against evil for all that is good and right. Instead, it manages to show them as young men who had the misfortune to be caught up in the sweep of history and forced into a violent life by unavoidable circumstances. We see the struggle some of them had between the violent actions that had become their life and their own sense of decency, and we see others enthusiastically revel in the murderous mayhem - glad for the excuse the war had given them to be free of the constraints of civilized society.  One scene in particular drives home the fact that these warriors were more boys than men. Jake (Maguire) faces his new bride, a young women already widowed by the war (Jewel) in the bedroom on their wedding night. When she asks him if he is a virgin, he blusters that "I've seen plenty" and when ask again if he has been with a woman, he seems frozen with terror, and only manages to say, "Girl, I've killed fifteen men." These were boys forced to become killers before many had the chance to be lovers.Though there were no Unionist protagonists in this film, it used an effective device to put across the humanity of the bushwhacker's enemies. A captured mailbag was plundered, and letters were read aloud as the bushwhacker's searched for enemy secrets. The letters turned out to be mundane messages from mothers to sons and brother to brother. The young men heard and acknowledge how like their own mothers and brothers these people sounded, and how in other circumstances they might find them fine people, before someone reminded them that the sons of that mother would kill them, given the chance.`Ride with the Devil' is filmed beautifully, and is as close to being cinematically perfect as could be desired. Its scenes of violence are quick, realistic, and brutal, but the film does not dwell on them. Indeed, there are long sequences that deal with nothing but the complex interpersonal relationships of the characters, and action war movie junkies are likely to find `Ride with the Devil' a disappointment despite its realism. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as a shy, decent young man trying to maintain his integrity in a violent life, and Jeffery Wright is outstanding as a freed slave who fights for the bushwhackers out of loyalty to his friend who freed him. All of the roles are well cast and acted, including Jewel in her film debut as a young Confederate widow.`Ride with the Devil' is the best done of any Civil War film that I have yet seen. It is beautifully filmed, skillfully acted, intelligently written, and tells its story with fairness and perspective. Unfortunately, its virtues are exceeded by its obscurity, as so many have never heard of it. Now that you know of it, don't cheat yourself by missing this outstanding film.Theo Logos

He went far beyond taking liberties with it...he ruined it. The plot development is horrible...characters don't develop, they simply change in the time it takes to switch scenes. And as other reviewers have noted, the ending is probably the worst part of all. As I watched (painfully), I questioned if the director even bothered to read the book. He took a wonderful, rousing adventure and turned it into a sickening, useless film that I will never watch again, let alone buy.

So, if your idea of a good movie contains a helicopter somehow remaining stable in flight behind a bullet train in a tunnel and someone taking a mask off their face off every couple of minutes, then this movie will most likely be a disappointment

$REVIEW.: This Spanish language film with English subtitles tells the story of Alberto, a divorced father who takes his two children, 14 year old Lucia and 10 year old Federico, on a family vacation in a South American country (probably Uruguay).  Apparently he doesn't get to spend much time with his children and he's determined not to let anything ruin the trip.Unfortunately, the hot springs resort he's picked for their vacation spot is rained out, and neither Lu nor Fed are all that excited about the trip anyway.  There's no television and not much of anything to do.  Lu meets some people of her own age, including a couple of boys, and she stages an act of mild adolescent rebellion by joining them for a dance party.  At the party Lu realizes she's not quite as grown up as she thinks she is, and the result is some nice father/daughter time. In the end when the vacation's over father and children all realize they've had a nice time in spite of all the difficulties.So this is a pleasant little film about growing up, or at least making an effort to grow up, and about changing family dynamics.  The pace tends to be slow and the background doesn't vary that much, but that puts more of the focus on the characters, especially Lu, who is excellently portrayed.

$REVIEW.: I guess good looking Britain's don't become actors.  This is just another movie that gets tons of "hype" put out about it and then it just becomes another kiddy fantasy with talking animals and hairy half-humans.Even the "white queen", the adult actor of this film is so butt ugly!  Isn't she the same ugly wench that played the angel in "Constantine?"  If they have gotten Elizabeth Hurley to play the role, that might have enhanced the appeal of this movie a tad.Disney seems to like to get British children for their films.  It's really beginning to get old.  Or maybe I'm just getting too old, and I'm just getting tired of the same old predictable casting happenstance.
$SUMMARY.: Why is everyone in this movie so darn ugly?

$review_text.: Excellent film about royal life during the 16th century. Story centers on Elizabeth's life in the English palace and what the Queen's working relationship was like among her closest advisers. Story provides little detail in regard to battles fought on her behalf. Basically, what one sees is her generals conferring with her at the palace about impending battles. Then, you see nothing of them until they return to the palace after the battle is concluded. This is an entertaining movie which provides a very detailed perspective of her life and her rule but only from the limited point of view from what was happening immediately around her.  Still, this is an excellent movie which is worthy of the 5 star category typical of HBO movie making.

$review_text.: [A Note on Editions: If you are a fan of the series, make sure that you get the 2-Disc Ultimate Edition.  That edition includes all of the documentaries, trailers, and extra content.  The single disc Ultimate Edition just contains the cleaned up movie, sound, and commentaries.  If you're not interested in the documentaries, go ahead and save a little money.  But, by all means, avoid the "Special" edition.  There is nothing special about it, particularly compared to its Ultimate brethren.]With producer Harry Saltzman out of the picture, his long-time partner Albert Broccoli knew that he had better find success with THE SPY WHO LOVED ME or face the end of an era.  Accordingly, more money was thrown at the film.  After the staggering sums of money spent on THUNDERBALL and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the producers scaled back the production for the next four films, with mixed success.  For THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, the budget was doubled from the budget for THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and it certainly shows.  This film marks the first good Roger Moore Bond, by this time comfortable with the role and with a budget to back him up.  While it certainly doesn't match the class of some of Connery's best endeavors, it surpasses his weaker outings and is certainly one of the better Moore pictures, if not the best.After the opening "gun barrel" sequence, we are greeted with an opening that smells familiar.  An underwater submarine experiences trouble and is "lost."  We soon learn that both a Royal British Navy submarine and a Russian submarine have mysteriously disappeared.  We next find Bond in Austria, wooing yet another  girl, only to receive word that he must return to headquarters.  After quickly suiting up in ski gear, Bond takes off on a terrific ski chase that looks wonderfully modern, diving in between crevasses and glaciers.  The scene ends with one of the most spectacular Bond stunts ever--Bond ski jumps off of a cliff, removes his skis mid-flight, and pulls the ripcord on a surprise parachute in the colors of the Union Jack.  The parachute gracefully falls down into a pair of hands and Binder's title sequence is underway.  The titles feature falling & trampoline silhouettes dancing through the air, as well as a male and female figure tossling with a gun, setting up the inevitable rivalry between the film's main protagonists.  The song, sung by Carly Simon, is one of the best Bond songs.  All in all, we are off to a great start.The plot of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is quite predictable and we soon realize why the opening teaser seemed so familiar: it is virtually a remake of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.  In fact, we even have the same director, Lewis Gilbert, behind the lens.  In both films, an evil villain has a device capable of swallowing transportation vehicles (space capsules in the previous film, nuclear submarines in this one) and plans to wreak havoc on the world, all the while confusing the Russians and the Americans about the mysterious nature of the disappearances.This time around, however, the Russians have a compelling agent of their own in the character of Agent Triple X, Major Anya Amasova (Barbara Bach).  In a world that was increasingly more accepting of female heroines, the Bond franchise finally gave Bond a leading lady that could hold her own.  At least this is how the critics tell it.  While Major Amasova is certainly the Bond girl who is most explicitly Bond's equal (given that the scriptwriters make sure to give them dueling lines), the best Bond girls have always been captivating and interesting in their own right.  In any case, the film begins with our two agents chasing down a piece of microfilm containing the plans of a tracking device capable of tracking nuclear submarines while they are underwater.  Whoever has the plans must be responsible for the mysterious submarine disappearances.  After a lengthy game of cat & mouse, the Russian and American forces finally decide to come together, pool their resources, and solve the case together.  From this point on in the film, Bond & Major Amasova must work together before time runs out.  The villain behind all of this is Karl Stromberg (Curd Jurgens), a man with serious Captain Nemo overtones, who has built a lavish underwater facility that he calls Atlantis.  Using the nuclear missiles aboard the captured submarines, Stromberg plans to nuke both New York and Moscow, starting a nuclear holocaust.  While the races above ground will fight it out until extinction, Stromberg will like peacefully beneath the waves in his wonderful city and establish a new civilization.  Will Bond and Major Amasova be able to stop his evil plans before it is too late?THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is memorable for several reasons.  First, the action in this picture is much better than the previous two Moore adventures.  Indeed, with an increased budget, the producers prove that you can do almost anything.  The set designs by Ken Adam are mammoth in size and the film entertains from start to finish.  While Stromberg's "Nemo" is not a very interesting character, his famous henchman Jaws (Richard Kiel) certainly makes up for it.  Equipped with metal jaws, a sense of humor, and invulnerability, Jaws is a great addition to the movie.  He certainly would not have worked outside the campy humor and puns of the Moore era, but inside of it he thrives and is a highlight of the film.  Indeed, he was so good and loved by audiences that he would be the only henchman to return in another Bond film (MOONRAKER).  Roger Moore is beginning to look a bit old in this film, especially across from Barbara Bach, who turns in a very good performance as Bond's equal.  Another highlight of the film, for me, is the Lotus Esprit, the best Bond vehicle since the infamous Aston Martin DB5.  Capable of converting into a submarine, the Lotus provides one of the best chase sequences in the series.  I can still remember watching these scenes as a child and wanting just such a car.  Hats off to the designers.  Additionally, the chase scene is notable for its fantastic helicopter work.All in all, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is a good entry in the series and certainly one of Moore's best films.  It is wonderful escapist entertainment and provides good action sequences from start to finish.  While I am generally annoyed by the more tongue-in-cheek Bonds, this film works and for some reason I don't mind the campy humor.  The Ultimate Edition looks and sounds great.  In fact, despite the aging Moore, this is one of the first films that looks current.  The effects and sets are starting to catch up with modern pictures and the picture doesn't look so dated as some of the other entries.  This new DVD set helps capture that, as well as containing all of the extras we've come to know and love.  This is definitely a must-see Bond film.

$REVIEW.: Robin is a girl(I kept thinking she belonged in a scooby doo cartoon), Batman is old and slightly fat. 2 Face gets his faced fixed and thinks he is ugly(when he finally looks normal) and tries to destroy gotham city with some type of bombs on helicopters. Movie is only 1hr 16mins, I only liked seeing Batman sick and fed up with criminals being brutal with them. I hated Kevin Conroy didn't do the voice work for Batman. The animation for this movie is top notch, very beautiful. I hate the mutants, I guess 2 face wasnt enough for Batman to fight. I hate how they hinted at the Joker,teasing us too much. The military helps the Mutants??wtf?? I hate how Robin cant fight and is one of the people Batman saved from the mutants. Overall this movie sucks for the most part and only was good at showing a different(and new type of)batman we are not used to seeing and giving excellent animation(I watched a 720p version of this movie and would love to see for a brief second this in 1080p). I would recommend watching and buying RE: Damnation, which only had one downfall and that was being slightly boring in the first 5-7 mins. I gave RE: Damnation a  5/5 stars and 10/10 and this movie a 2/5 stars and 4/10

$REVIEW.: THE MATTHEW SHEPARD STORY is a made for television movie made in 2002 and only recently released on DVD
 It is time for us all to see this film again as a reminder of how heinous was this incident that rocked the world


Matthew Shepard (December 1, 1976 - October 12, 1998) as a student at the University of Wyoming who was tortured and beaten and left o die on a barbed wire fence in the prairie of Wyoming - because he was gay

Writers John Wierick and Jacob Krueger gathered the information surrounding this event and the subsequent events following his death, focusing on the trial and the difficult gesture his parents made concerning the fate of the murderers.Roger Spottiswoode directed this compelling film, electing to engage the talents of Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston as the parents of Matthew (played with great dignity by Shane Meier)

 The remainder of the cast includes such touching portraits of the others involved in this tragedy as played by Tani Gellman, Wendy Crewson and Kristen Thompson
 While the drama of this film is not in the same arena as 'The Laramie Project', it still is a potent reminder of an unnecessary injustice that unfortunately is still being played out across the country

 Perhaps with the DVD now available for wider viewing the crime will affect more people to action begun by Judy Shepard

$REVIEW.: A solid effort in the 'found/home video' genre. The penultimate version I've screened would be 'Cloverfield'. Sadly, the drecks are too numerous to count. This flick falls somewhere in between.Appreciated the writers excluding the logic of the situation. There isn't anything that could resemble a plausible explanation, so, like 'Carrie', the story is all that matters.Tells the tale of three friends who are transformed by a mysterious crystal. Having been changed, they begin to realize that they have extraordinary comic book-like superpowers. Psychokinesis that begins with the minor ability to move small objects quickly escalating to near mystical feats of prowess, culminating in the ability to fly.Matt - the athlete, Steve - the popular student, and Andrew - the outcast.As they accept their new reality, the trio begin to explore their powers with exuberance, laughter, and light-hearted hijinks you expect of teenagers - lifting a girl's dress and the like. However, a close call where an innocent nearly dies has Matt and Steve making "a rule" that they have to accept responsibility for their actions; echoing theStan Leerefrain that with great power comes great responsibility.But outsider Andrew quietly defies the group agreement, he doesn't feel the need to contain and hide. In fact, he's of the mindset that they should personally benefit from their awesome gifts. Beginning with his abusive father - by breaking every bone in his body. The abused kid begins to emotionally and psychologically detach from any moral restraint. Having spent his entire life being the object of humiliation and torment - the effects of having such incredible power begins to take a toll on his sense of morality and even his sanity. And having two popular kids giving him defined boundaries isn't what he wants to hear. Soon, he begins to believe himself beyond his own humanity, a god amongst ants.Enjoyable exploration of the common theme in comic books: What would you do if you *really* had superpowers?A well-worn retreadthat's made enjoyable due to the decent-to-excellent sfx and believable acting by the three co-stars. In particular, was quite impressed with young Alex Russell, who played Matt. A young actor that I think has a lot of potential and on whom I suspect I'll be watching more of in the future.

$review_text.: I recall reading something a year or two ago about employee dissatisfaction. It commented that it tended to increase during times of economic trouble because employees who felt unhappy in the workplace didn't have the ability to escape. They were stuck with their current jobs, since leaving might mean they couldn't find another one. They also seldom got sympathy from other people who said, "Hey, at least you have a job!" This reached its culmination for me when the place where I worked put up a motivational poster that said, I kid you not, "I should be grateful I have a job." Indeed.In this time of economic troubles, it's perhaps surprising that a movie like this, where three friends get together to kill each other's horrible bosses, hasn't come along already. Well, it sort of did in 1980 with 9 to 5, but that was a bit different. I don't think I recall Franklin Hart, Jr, shooting anyone.The movie's title bosses are a corporate president (Kevin Spacey), a cokehead who inherited his father's chemical company (Colin Farrell), and, in one of the funnier performances, a dentist who doubles as a sexual predator (Jennifer Aniston). Their oppressed employees are, respectively, a man who is working hard for a position the corporate president takes for himself (Jason Bateman), a hard-working employee who loved the cokehead's father (Jason Sudekis), and a dental hygienist/sex offender who is recently engaged (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Charlie Day). One night while mutually commiserating with each other in a bar a plan begins to take shape. What if they killed their bosses? Soon they have a "murder consultant" in the form of one MF Jones (Jamie Foxx), and, with vague memories that confuse Strangers on a Train with Throw Mama from the Train, the make ready to make murder.I had no great expectations going into this film, but I was surprised at how enjoyable it was and how much I liked it (also surprising? The ten-year-old boy sitting next me. Some parents...). The film is as raunchy as you'd expect any adult-oriented comedy to be, but it uses its raunch to great effect. There's the expected jokes centering around sex and bodily functions, but nothing too extreme.I was also surprised at how intelligent the movie is. At the start I was coming up with objections to the notion that the characters needed to kill their bosses instead of just get new ones, only to find the screenplay explaining why they couldn't just up and quit. I was also greatly amused when the friends ran into a former pal of theirs who'd lost his last job with Lehman Brothers and since had been forced to resort to offering a "hearty handshake", as it were, to men in bars.The performances were excellent all around. Spacey in particular seemed to be having a great time playing a deliciously evil man, while Aniston was clearly happy to ditch her good girl image. Day, who is a relative newcomer to film, plays a character not dissimilar to that of Charlie Kelly, proves that he can certainly hold his own on the screen with the big boys (and girl).The movie is ably directed by Seth Gordon, who keeps the action moving at a decent, but not frenetic, pace. He also knows when to throw in a good Tarantino homage. It's produced by the somewhat infamous Brett Ratner who proves that as a director, he makes for an acceptable producer.This isn't the best comedy ever, but it was a good time at the movies, and after a summer that's included films like the rather dull Green Lantern and the aggressively boring Transformers: Bark at the Moon, I'll take what I can get.

$review_text.: I remember liking the music that Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers made when they first came along.  My rock and roll listening years coincide pretty much with their history.  And I'm from central Florida too, so it made it a little more special I guess that they were a good band.  I remember the buzz that "damn the torpedoes" created when it came out.  So many great songs on one album didn't seem possible.  But to be fair, I didn't try to be an expert on them.  I'm not an expert on much of anything.  But if you were young during the 60's and 70's, and you liked listening to fm radio, then you can better judge my qualifications.  But I do remember an early thought, that Tom Petty sounded like one of Bob Dylan's incarnations.The biographical movie (the product being reviewed) is good.  It's made in modern times, so you get some good quality sound and video for your home system.  I enjoy this modern way to enjoy rock and roll, and own several other dvd format covers of rock legends.  This one on Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers is a good mix of talk and music.  It's pretty much all positive perspective, so I'd guess it was conceived and financed by themselves (Tom Petty).  That doesn't bother me, because it delivers good entertainment value, and I already liked the music.  I wasn't looking for someone to knock them down anyway.I'm sort of old now, but I was paying attention when the Beatles were still new and Ed Sullivan was important, "The times, they are a changin" was being covered in all the grade school talent shows, and everyone knew who Roy Orbison was.  So when the Traveling Wilburys popped up, and the album was great....that was a great joy for me.  Tom Petty seems to understand how special that opportunity was for him, which I'm happy to know.The "other" disc is a concert in Gainesville, Florida.  It features the modern band line up (which is fine).  As a historical document, it's unfortunate that Petty doesn't look well and seems medicated (to me).  Everyone will have their favorite songs, so I won't try to add something meaningful here.  But I will say, I enjoyed watching another concert video from much earlier in their career that was killer.  Search for Santa Monica New Years concert 1978.  The band is really good live.I got one of those email reminders to go to amazon and review this purchase.  So I'm here, but I can't really offer anything more profound that what others have said.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers have released some great songs and albums.  There are unrecognized gems that never get heard.  One of my favorites is their cover of Dylan's "License to Kill" for his 30 year all star concert.  You can watch it on a youtube search.  It really grabs me in a way I can't explain....

$REVIEW.: Johnny Depp is a god.  Geoffrey Rush is the same but in a different way.  Put them on screen together in an action picture based on a Disney ride, and you get a lot more than you would normally bargain for.  Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the result of this dangerous combination.  Get ready for a wonderful ride, though, because this movie is a blast.  It succeeds on every level it tries to achieve.The plot can actually get a little convoluted as the movie goes on.  Twists and turns, changing loyalties and double (or even triple!) crosses abound.  Basically, young Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly), daughter of the governor of Port Royal (Jonathan Pryce), helps rescue a boy adrift at sea.  She finds a medallion that indicates he's a pirate, but she hides it from her father and the Navy for fear of the boy being hung.  Years later, that boy has grown into Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith who is besotted with her.  Captain Jack Sparrow (Johhny Depp) comes to port in order to steal a ship, having been marooned by his crew on a deserted island.  The Black Pearl, now captained by his former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), attacks Port Royal, in search of the medallion.  It seems the medallion is the key to a curse that's affecting the Black Pearl, one that Barbossa is determined to end, even if it means spilling the blood of a beautiful English woman.  Will and Jack have to chase them down and stop them before it's too late.That's just an introduction to the plot, but I don't want to spoil anything further.  I found the details of the curse even more horrible because I hadn't heard about it.  If you really want to know, many other reviewers (even Ebert) have said that much.  It's not a complicated plot, but it does move along at a fast pace.  I have seen several people ask questions that are (to me) quite obviously answered in the movie but were easily missed.  You don't need to think deeply about it, but you do need to pay attention.This, however, is an action flick, so the action is the key that makes up for a few logical inconsistencies.  And what glorious action it is!  Swashbuckling swordfights, explosions, creatures from beyond the grave, it's all here in abundance.  Some of the fights go on a bit too long (especially the climactic fight), but it's certainly never boring.  The choreography (especially in the fight between Bloom and Depp) is simply wonderful.  The special effects are fabulous, but they don't drown out the actual movie.  They are incorporated into the plot seamlessly, dazzling you but not distracting you.  The CGI with the skeletons (especially when they dance in and out of the moonlight) is breathtaking, and I certainly didn't notice any little mistakes there.  The ship to ship action (both firing on each other and grappling) make you feel like you are there.  The picture is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, so you know it's going to be loud.  You won't be disappointed.  It is quite loud.  If you find that a bad thing, you may want to skip this.The acting is simply marvelous from the main characters.  Knightly is suitably aristocratic as the governor's daughter, and she warms quite nicely into an action heroine as the movie goes on.  Bloom is very good as well in his second major role since Lord of the Rings.  I hope he doesn't get typecast into action movies, though.  However, Depp and Rush just run away with everything in this movie.  They play it perfectly, as only skilled actors can do.  If they play it over the top, it would destroy the movie and make it a parody.  If they play it too straight, the movie would be laughable in its earnest seriousness.  Instead, they combine the too, adding some outlandish humour but keeping it just this side of camp.  Depp is hilarious as Captain Sparrow, who English Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) wrongly calls "one of the worst pirates I've ever seen." He has said in interviews that he based the character on a combination of Keith Richards homage and Pepe Le Pew.  I can definitely see it.  He has many laugh-out-loud moments.  Rush is perfect as the villainous Captain Barbossa.  He's dedicated to his men and to foiling the curse that they've been under.  He's not evil incarnate, and Rush does give him some depth, mainly through facial expressions and how he says things.  He's desperate to feel human again, and he's determined to do what it takes, no matter what the consequences.While I love Jonathan Pryce, I don't think his character was fleshed out enough, and he had a couple of moments that just didn't seem to work.  It's not that Pryce overdid it, but it's the writing of the character that I thought was off.  When rescued from the pirates attacking his ship, he taunts them happily with hand gestures and words that just seemed out of character for him.  While Pryce did a strong job, I thought his character was the weakest of the main ones, followed closely by Norrington.Overall, I have to give Pirates a full five stars.  While there are a couple of inconsistencies or things not explained (how did Gibbs become a pirate when he was serving on a British ship 7 years earlier?), the movie quickly makes you forget that so you can enjoy the ride.  Most movies made from Disney attractions look very bland and boring, but this one raises the bar high for upcoming pictures.  And you know there will be some. In the meantime, enjoy this one.  Forget the Disney roots and revel in what is probably the funnest movie of the summer(...)

$REVIEW.: When Tenko first aired in the UK between 1981 to 1985, it held a nation enthralled. Never before had the experience of the former colonial Singapore dwellers from England, Australia and Holland in WW2 been depicted with such gritty, unabashed and uncensored reality.The three series take the viewer from the heady, luxirious days of somewhat aloof and arrogant colonial, late 1930's days of the small eastern enclave, through the very real horrors of the POW experience of civilian women in the War years, at the hands of their Japanese conquerers and the much altered aftermath and adjustment of a changed and uncertain world contemplating peace and normality from 1945 up to a one off reunion special set in 1950. This series, believe it or not, was pivotal as a BBC drama for it's subject matter and almost entirely female cast. Tenko is gripping, real and enormously emotional. Stand out performances include Stephanie Cole as the fearsome and principled Dr Beatrice Mason, Patricia Lawrence as the kindly Dutch Nun, Sister Ulrica, Stephanie Beacham as the spoiled and fiesty Rose Millar and Anne Bell as the bored but humane army wife, Marion Jefferson.You will not fail to be moved, educated and enthralled by a drama now some 25 years of age and still an outstanding body of work. The blistering heat and deprivation of the POW camps give no hint of the Dorset used quarry, in England, in which the main body of the series was actually filmed. Excellent TV!

$REVIEW.: Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are absolutely brilliant as a pair of brothers in the streets of New York City who get drawn into the violent world of boxing. This is based on the life of Jake LaMotta, known as "Raging Bull" or "The Bronx Bull". You can hear that gritty upbringing in their accents, see it in the chain-link-fenced public pool, and when you hear that Jake was forced by his father to fight for money as a kid, you know just how rough this life could be.De Niro channels that inner range and shows it spectacularly. This isn't a quiet Rocky character who mulls over things and wants the wall-flower girl. Jake has had a hard life and he deserves something better. He mistreats his feisty girlfriend until a nubile blonde catches his eye - then it's out with the old, in with the new, and soon enough he's treating his new wife just as poorly. He mistrusts everyone around him, including his brother, who he accuses of being too close with his wife. Apparently in real life it was a best friend who he had that fight with, but it's understandable that they want to compress storylines for the movie's sake.Yes, the boxing scenes are violent. I don't feel at all that they were gratuitous. Rather, I get a strong sense that the movie is being a "documentary" and showing what it was like. Jake's strength was that he wouldn't go down. He could take the beating and remain on his feet. Pummeling that would have destroyed weaker men could not take him out.The movie is also straightforward about Jake's flaws. This isn't a Rocky-style "he was a hero" story. It looks straight on at the things Jake did wrong along the way. Yes, Jake threw a fight - he had admitted it. He wasn't good to the people in his life.While the characters are flawed, I think De Niro and Pesci are both superb at bringing them to life in a realistic way. De Niro's weight gain is fairly impressive, from the beginning to the end of the movie. Apparently he became an awesome boxer as well. That's dedication to one's craft.As one might expect, the movie is all about Men and the World of Men. Women, if shown, are either being lusted after or beaten up on, and rarely do we even know what their names are. We might have had two named women in the wives of the two brothers, but I don't think they even ever talk with each other. So that's a shame, to not get more of a sense of any sort of a relationship. Unless that really was all those men ever did with women their entire lives.Still, an interesting insight into the world of Bronx boxing.

$review_text.: Tepid half-baked legal mish-mash that's all dressed up with nowhere useful to go. John Grisham's source novel about jury manipulation in a tobacco industry litigation has been adapted to move the action to the issue of gun control (though the film makers needn't have bothered - there was never any danger of this ever being confused with Michael Mann's superior The Insider). Confronted with the gun death of her husband in an incident of work rage, a widow is persuaded to institute civil action against the gun industry - which has never lost a lawsuit of this type. That established, she then promptly disappears for the rest of the film as the viewer is asked to believe in the determinism of jury consutants (thank OJ for that!) and the worthiness of corrupt jurors. It's all totally forgettable nonsense - a courtroom movie for the hysterical tabloid set that distinguishes itself for having the most underwritten, unmoving courtroom summation ever put to screen (although everyone involved clearly thought this was a rousing moment). Many of the American reviewers on this page have taken issue with the film's soapbox politics on the issue of gun violence. Providing it with so much credit only distracts from a far more basic reflection - how incredibly bad this movie is. Director Gary Fleder (Don't Say a Word) is fast becoming synonymous with over-produced below average thrillers, an association he proudly continues with this latest sub-par outing. Unlike the best Grisham adaptations (The Firm; The Rainmaker) Fleder eschews character-driven tension and conflict for show-offy gadgetry and overly-dramatic presentation of fairly undramatic things. Grisham, as usual, has share of the blame for the incredulous proceedings - having frankly benefited over the years by the quality overcompensation that film-makers have brought to his work. Fleder however is no Sydney Pollack - and he's certainly no Francis Coppola (and, on this latest evidence, never will be). What we lose in quality mediation, we gain in stupidity - as the lawyers pale into caricatures of idiocy and irrelevance, the jury room rehashes and exploits your memory of infinitely better movies; the American legal system looks even more of a joke than it actually is and the lead characters behave in ways so dumb that you wonder how they could get their heads around the schemes you're asked to believe they're engaged in. John Cusack and Rachel Weiz give workmanlike performances, whilst Gene Hackman tries his characteristic best to deliver a nastier version of the Gene persona we know and love  - only just about overcoming his own infectious charisma enough for us to dislike his character. The real acting news however is yet another nail in the coffin of the Dustin Hoffman legend. If ever there was any doubt about the steady decline (dating back to his overrated performance in Rain Man) of this once truly great master, Runaway Jury will dispose of it. Hoffman's performance is as hammy as it is portentous, with a Southern accent by way of Brooklyn amateur dramatics. Al Pacino has become louder and show-offy as he's aged - but still delivers the goods. Hoffman seems only to have become more self-involved, self conciously ticcing and twitching his way to delivering &quot;a performance&quot; worthy of the acting legend he uncontrovertably is - and (perhaps problematically) knows he is. (To be frank, the evidence of this tendency can be found early on in his peformance in his own directorial debut, Straight Time). Come back Benjamin, all is forgiven. Runaway Jury stutters and splutters along in underwelming execution from one clumsy plot point to the next, reaching its preposterous &quot;twist&quot; ending by way of sheer assault on your IQ. In the end, the only twelve angry men in this tortuous deal are in the audience - demanding a refund on their ticket money.

$REVIEW.: THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, in 2003, was remade and released to a new generation of Horror film fans all around the world. Three years later, making it 2006, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING was released giving us a glimpse of how Leatherface became to be.August 1939, Thomas Hewitt is born under unspeakable circumstances in a meat-packing plant in Travis County Texas. His mother dies right after birth (partially due to the neglect of her employer) and soon after, the plant boss abandons the newborn in a dumpster out back. Only to be discovered by LUDA MAE HEWITT (played by Marietta Marich) while she searches for food. She proceeds to take the baby, whom she named THOMAS, to the Hewitt residence where the seeds of one of the most deranged and infamous murderers in American history are planted.July 1969, brothers ERIC (played by Matthew Bomer) and DEAN (played by Taylor Handley) are being driven across the country by their girlfriends CHRISSIE (played by the sexy Jordana Brewster) and BAILEY (played by Diora Baird) to be shipped out to Vietnam. This will be Eric's second tour of duty as he is returning to watch over his recently drafted little brother. Unknown to Eric, Dean has his own plans to dodge the draft and head down to Mexico with Bailey. As they pass through Travis County, they stumble across the house of horrors where a now adult LEATHERFACE (THOMAS BROWN HEWITT) (again played by Andrew Bryniarski) has developed a disturbing interest in chainsaws and bloody torture. Bailey, Eric, and Dean are killed off, leaving Chrissie to defend herself against the cannibalistic wackos. After a gory braw witht he family, Chrissie finally escapes by breaking into a car parked out front of the Hewitt residents and drives off, relieved that she has escaped with her life. As she drives, Leatherface appears in the back seat and slices Chrissie through the back killing her off.The 2003 remake of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE was outstanding for living up to the original 1974, although making itself scarier, gorier, and way more disturbing. THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING shows itself to be even more disturbing and even more gorier than its predecessor. I was shocked to see that Jordana Brewster's character was killed off, leaving no survivors for the film, but after awhile, it made sense to me while there were no survivors: Simply because this film is to show us how Leatherface and his psychotic family had gotten started.

$review_text.: Amazing show. Can't argue with that and there's no point saying more about it. Sets nice, well presented yadayadayada. The only thing I'm bothered about is why is this not a full screen set. Or why isn't there the option to buy a full screen set. This show started in 94 and was not filmed in widescreen (Not as far as I know anyway) so the only thing that that can mean is some idiots just gone and stuck two black lines on the top and bottom of the screen, covering up a percentage of the picture and calling it widescreen. I don't see any other way of doing it.Anyway aside from that it's still e.r, and when its e.r it doesn't matter if some idiots cut off half the sound and the picture. You still watch it, and if you cant, then you buy it instead.And thats exactly what I'm gonna do.(...)

$REVIEW.: This is the best of the Fairy Tale films Disney has ever done, with Beauty and the Beast a close second. The thing that makes this the best is the Villian, Malificent. She is still the best villain they have created and so far has never been topped.The songs are lovely AND until The Little Mermaid and beyond was the first time they gave the prince a name besides "Charming" as well as a good character instead of just being there to get the girl at the end....and his horse Samson is wonderful.Simply a delight.I do have one comment about the review of the foreign DVD 2-disc set.Sadly there is NO guarantee that what has been released in Europe will be what we get in the US and vice-versa. For example the Legend DVD here in the US is far superior to the European release, with more extras etc.. And the Brotherhood of the Wolf DVD released in Canada is a 2 or 3-disc set instead of the one disc we got here in the US.So watch this listing and make sure this has what you want before you just assume it will have the extras they get across the big pond....

$REVIEW.: Any film that creates this much activity with people taking their time to write on-line reviews (over 800 on Amazon, over 1200 on IMDB) will have many folks at opposite ends of the rating scale.  To survive with 4 and 8 star ratings, respectively, says a lot for the staying power of the film.  My rankings?  A 5 for Amazon and a 9 for IMDB.  What David Lynch has created is an engrossing 2 hour and 27 minute cinematic experience that I was sorry to see come to a close.  Any film that leaves as many indelible images in my mind as this one, will always get my support.  (The scene in the Club Silencio featuring a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's 'Crying' is inspired film-making.  The scene at 'The Corral' was just plain spooky, and the hit-man in Adam Kesher's house was hilarious.)  I'm not going to get into the arguments about &quot;what did this scene mean?&quot; or &quot;this one didn't go anywhere&quot;, mainly because it's fruitless.  You either get it or you don't.  To be fair, this film made much more sense the second time around. That I wanted to watch it a second time says something about Lynch's ability to entertain even if you're lost somewhere in the story.  Yes, I know I used the terms 'entertain' and 'Lynch' in the same sentence, but it was intentional.  I wasn't dreaming.  Honest.  (Watch the film as a rental first, because it's not everyone's cup of tea.  That's what I did.  THEN I put it on my &quot;Wish List.&quot;)  Thank you, Mr. Lynch.  You are now officially forgiven for 'Dune.'
$SUMMARY.: Obviously, Lynch was doing SOMETHING right...

$REVIEW.: If you are a fan of Popeye, it goes without saying that you will enjoy the most pristine, complete and uncut fully restored versions of the cartoons in chronological order with nothing left out. But what you get with this set is a lot more.If you are familiar with modern computer animated features, you know the 3D feel that comes from the computer's ability to rotate models and look at them from different vantage points. What's amazing about many of these early Popeye shorts is that they managed to achieve the same effect in parts, and represent a level of hand drawn animation that has not been surpassed to this day.As others have mentioned, these uncut versions include the original title sequences. That might not seem like a big deal, but the titles start with the opening music, which is a fundamental part of the overall orchestration done for each cartoon. If you think you know the Popeye opening theme song, pay close attention. You will hear a different arrangement from one cartoon to the next. Since Paramount studios held the publishing rights to the music in its other movies, Popeye was able to incorporate a musical score that would be hard to match in any modern cartoon.For most people, the extra features are merely icing on the cake. The stories, the presentation, the ad libs, sight gags, and artistry already put the cartoons in a league of their own. But this set also provides context.In addition to the Popeye cartoons, there are two complete documentaries. One covers the origins and development of Popeye, and shows how Popeye evolved from the original comic strip to the animated cartoon in all its incarnations. The other covers the birth and history of filmed animation itself.  If you aren't already familiar with the animation process, this documentary will show you how animation evolved from the mind blowing concept of a drawing that can move to the detailed and fully formed art that is present in the early Popeye cartoons.This set also includes "Popumentaries" that are shorter features on subjects such as supporting characters, Olive Oyl, Wimpy, Bluto, and Swee'Pea.  Plus, there are audio commentaries to go with some of the episodes.Additional content consists of early animation ranging from simple Krazy Kat and Heeza Liar cartoons to the Out of the Inkwell series.I'm not normally a fan of commentaries, and on most discs I buy I don't even bother to listen to them. One complaint about the ones on these discs is that they range from mildly interesting to mediocre. What they really provide is context.If you are interested in animation itself, watching the documentary is a good place to start. Watching the other animated shorts works well as a whole, especially when coupled with the documentary. Watching the early ones without that sense of context might not be very meaningful.Watching the Out of the Inkwell series shows the evolution of the Fleischer' art from the most basic to the elaborate and gives a good feel for what made Popeye stand out from what came before it.If you save the commentaries for last, you will find that they give you some more information about specific details or specific animators, but they overlap a lot with each other and cover a lot that was already mentioned in the documentaries. You will get some more details out of it, but I would not recommend going straight for the commentaries, or even listening to them before you've seen the supplemental features.To be sure, you will get your fill of cartoon violence, battles between Popeye and Bluto over Olive, and lots of spinach, but you also get fleshed out ideas, Dave Fleisher's requirement of a gag in every scene, and the subtleties of Popeye's mumbling that might have been lost on you as a child. They may not be in color for the most part, but it's the later ones made years after the ones in this collection that truly lack the "color" found in these original ones.While these cartoons do contain some ethnic stereotypes, sexism, and violence that would not done today, these are nevertheless appropriate for children and adults alike. Aside from all the special features, the cartoons themselves stand on their own merits as good entertainment.

$REVIEW.: I recently watched the musical remake of Little Shop of Horrors and enjoyed it immensely, and my curiosity about the genesis of that film lead me to its progenitor.  I hadn't realised that Roger Corman's original was intended as a comedy--I'd thought that it was a cheapie horror film with camp humor arising from its unintended absurdity.  This is absolutely not the case, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  The absurdity of Little Shop, and there is plenty, is all fully intended.  At times it is almost as if the Monty Python troupe is doing a black-and-white horror spoof, it is so good.  I find it impossible to say whether the musical remake or the original is &quot;better&quot;--they are simply different, and each amusing in its own way.  I prefered Rick Moranis's Seymour to that of Jonathan Haze, but Jackie Joseph's Audrey had funnier lines and was less pathetic than Ellen Greene's.  But what really surprised me was that the comic touches I had thought were signatures of the Saturday Night Live/Second City crowd were all in the original:  the sadistic dentist and his masochistic patient; &quot;Pain&quot; magazine, &quot;Feed me!&quot;, and more.  Futhermore, the original had some more absurd characters that didn't make it into the remake, including a parody of the detectives from Dragnet and Seymour's mother, a hypochondriac whose home cooking is all flavoured with medicine!  Although the sound and picture quality of the version I watched was poor, it was worth sitting through if you enjoyed the more recent version.  Also worthy of note was the spiky, xylophone-timpani-and-baritone-saxophone-laden score by Fred Katz.

$REVIEW.: This has to be my favorite J Carpenter film as it deals with the basic age old dilemma of good vs evil, science vs religion
 The twist to this confrontation is an existing cylindrical ooze swirling filled chamber located in the sub terranean level beneath a Catholic Church (apparently a secret to all except a monk-like order who has guarded it for thousands of years and whomever happens to be the priest du jour).Long story short, the information falls into the hands of Donald Pleasance (Catholic Clergyman) who in turn turns to an old friend, who happens to teach theoretical science at a local university, for help
 Students of various specialties are recruited to aid in the study of this cylinder.Biblical external warnings are subtle and not so subtle at times

There are catatonic homeless surrounding the church (Alice Cooper playing more than a cameo role as one of the homeless), who seem to resent the presence of the clergy as well as those of science in the church, I wont be a spoiler and mention the other warnings.The Cylindrical Chamber is discovered to be a prison....and as expected its prisoner has escaped

 The film concentrates on the effects the escaped "prisoner" has on each character


 Also who the prisoner is and what lengths are gone to to free it permanently are clever and unique.

$review_text.: First saw this classic back in middle school history class while studying the famous Boston Tea Party. Though I recalled only fragments from back then, I knew I had to rent it again. So glad I did. This film is most definitely a period icon. Though some fan boards have rated it as classic-fiction, it most definitely is not. Brilliantly cast, produced, written, and directed it unfolds the American Revolution and Boston Tea Party quite colorfully.Hal Stalmaster finely portrays the key character Johnny as an innocent youth caught up in middle of upending Colonial establishments vs. the British Parliament of 1774. Viewers will also recognize a familiar face from the classic West Side Story; Richard Beymer as Rab, a close friend of Johnny's, and one of the Liberty sanction leaders for the Revolution.Just under 2 hrs, the drama nicely unfolds as the Liberty sanction prepares for war against the legendary Red Coats.

The Muppets present their take on the classic tale: with Miss Piggy as an island castaway, Tim Curry on fine ham acting as Long John Silver and  Kermit returning as Captain Smollet the movie is fun and often incredibly  funny.There are the obligatory musical numbers which seem to be a  precedent for Muppet movies - but each and every song in MUPPET TREASURE  ISLAND does not disappoint


They're all catchy, funny and well-written and  presented.The plot takes a supporting role only to the zany antics of  Gonzo, Fozzie et al
and the human cameos (another Muppet precedent) will  bring a smile to your face: particularly Jennifer Saunders in fine  grotesque comedic form.

$REVIEW.: I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan so much I could quote every line from Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and The Waterboy for much of the late 90's. Going into the new millennium, Sandler seem to not be able to decide whether to stick with his sophomoric shtick as with Little Nicky or move into a more sophisticated style as he did in Punch Drunk Love. And of course there is always romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore. His latest trek into the sophisticated realm was Spanglish.The backdrop of the film is an essay a student has written for her application to Yale. It explains why her mother is the person she most admires and goes on to explain how her mom took her from Mexico and made her the person she was today. The problem with this is that the movie then doesn't revolve around the young girl yet focuses on the family he mother began to work for upon arriving in America. In fact the girl gets very little screen time in the movie. The family includes Sandler as the dad with an inferiority complex at being the best chef in the country, his wife, played by T&eacute;a Leoni, a victim of downsizing who can quite adapt to being a stay at home mom. They have two children, a son who barely makes blip on screen and an overweight daughter played by an actress who tries to pull off the "wise beyond her age" act but isn't able to do so. Alcoholic grandma also lives with them played perfectly by Cloris Leachman who delivers the best line in the movie, "Honey, lately, your low self-esteem is just good common sense." That line has entered into my repertoire of insults and can't wait until I find the perfect time to unleash it.The movie finally hit its stride when the family movies to a beach house for the summer when Sandler's family is introduced to the Mexican girl who is forced to move in with them due to distance reasons. Leoni finds in her the daughter she always wanted which causes problem with basically everyone else in the film.The film is well written finding a balance in-between drama and comedy and also features what was one of the most disturbing sex scenes I have seen in a while. If that ever happen to me, I may have to give up sex for a while. As for the negatives, the movie seems to forget that is it based on an essay and there are many things that I doubt the girl ever knew yet she is able to write about it. Also all the driving scenes it is very obvious that green screens were used and they looked as bad as a SNL skit. A big budget movie should avoid such pitfalls. On the DVD, don't forget to check out the deleted scenes to see one of the funniest scenes with Leoni's character preparing for a party. Although the other scenes make you understand why they left out.

$REVIEW.: I am a diehard lifelong Elvis fan and this is the ONLY movie on Elvis ever made that is outstanding
Meyers is perfect, without going over the top or looking like an imitator
Other movies had Elvis with his jumpsuit on at Graceland, overdoing the accent, sunglasses on everywhere, ect


(and that includes Kurt Russell who was WAY overrated in his portrayal)

The rest of the cast is also outstanding, as well as the script and using the King's real music ! The story line for the most part was very accurate and focused on important things no other movie has


Kudos to Quaids performance of Colonel Tom
I can't believe it took so long to release this on DVD


My only question now would be...can Myers & Co


do a sequel to finish the rest of his life ????!!!!

$REVIEW.: I tend to notice a pattern when it comes down to Oscar winners. For every film that deserves to win such as Return of the King and Titanic and Schindler's List, we get films that oddly win like American Beauty, Chicago, Shakespeare in Love and this one. Not saying that this is a bad film(the other 2 are however) but I like it going how did this win the entire thing? I wasn't a fan of the way too overdramatic Mystic River but with this film it's good but I wouldn't say it's Best Picture worthy like Braveheart or Titanic but it's good.Frankie Dunn is a boxing manager training a Title bout contender. Only before the match, the fighter ditches him for someone else and wins. In walks in Maggie Fitzgerald, an early 30s waitress who wants to be a fighter only Frankie won't teach her but with the help of Frankie's friend and ex-boxer Eddie she goes on her way to the top only to hit a really big snag.Like I said, this won Best Picture so I watched it after the fact it won and I don't see how it won. Similar to A Beautiful Mind or American Beauty, a film wins the big award while more deserving didn't get it like Saving Private Ryan over Shakespeare or Gladiator over Crouching Tiger. Guess I'm just not getting the big deal.One problem that really plagued Mystic River was it was too overdramatic. It was almost like the film kept asking you whether you were crying or emotionally moved yet. With this film however it doesn't have that which was a plus such as the last scene with boxer/trainer. And kudos for having Maggie tell off her leech family members.The film does have some issues though such as the wannabe pipsqueak boxer Danger. It just seems like a break from all the dramatic stuff by adding some humor but it doesn't fit. Same with the reasons why Frankie isn't speaking with his daughter anymore. While it does leave his character even more alone and broken at the end, why bother putting it in in the first place if you're not going to resolve it. Even Eddie's 110th final bout gets resolved. It's also a really dark film at nighttime with very bad lighting.Performances are one of its saving graces with them being likable people, even funny. Although I don't understand the attraction to Hilary Swank. Yeah her physicalness in the film's good but it's not like she was the best performance that year.I'd kind of recommend it although I have no idea why. I don't know whether to like it or call it overrated. Guess Oscar had the same problem I did.

Sure they were cheap and quickly made with sets and effects we laughed at even then.  That's what made (and still makes) them fun.  As an aside, this was Leonard Nimoy's first credited screen role.  Wooden acting and almost no dialog, he has come a long way.  May these movie time capsules never die!!Quality of transfer and sound good considering the paucity of masters available.

 This movie is very intense!  Once you start watching you won't be able to stop because you will be on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen
 Leonardo DiCaprio is probably one of the most unappreciated actors out their
 This movie definitely deserved an Oscar alongside Leonardo DiCaprio


 This movie shows how life really is for these poor people and captures the grittiness of what they go through just to live another day

 I highly recommend this movie to everybody

 Your heart will sink and make you think twice about how good your life really is when watching this
 Please don't hesitate buying this movie and passing it along to your friends and family.I really wish more movies like these were made more often to keep reminding us that their are these horrible things going on everyday and we really don't pay attention to and we should.

$review_text.: Ben Stiller&#8217;s Walter Mitty of 2013 bears a passing resemblance to Danny Kaye&#8217;s of 1947, and none at all to James Thurber&#8217;s original creation (in which a hen-pecked husband, who inhabits a short story about five pages long, is sent out to buy overshoes and dog biscuits while his wife has her hair done). So those professional critics who complain (and some have) that Stiller doesn&#8217;t capture Thurber&#8217;s nuanced social commentary are talking through their hats.Nor, as far as I know, did Thurber leave behind Tolkienesque appendices of the sort that might underpin the two hour rollercoaster on show. It is a story of derring-do, adversity and high-jinks only matched by the development trajectory of this script. In its decade-long passage through the hands of agents, writers, producers, studios and directors, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was also dunked in the arctic ocean, shot at by Afghan warlords and abandoned in Himalayan wastelands, before falling for its final release into the loving arms of Ben Stiller who found himself not only leading the cast but directing the film as well.Usually films with this sort of midwifery are a disaster. This one&#8217;s a peach. I&#8217;m inclined to give Stiller much of the credit, though I dare say Steve Conrad&#8217;s screenplay didn&#8217;t write itself.On a big screen, it is stunning. This is what Hollywood blockbusters should be like: imaginative, inventive, engaging, beautiful, sweeping, clever, well observed, well acted, and fun. Stiller demonstrates himself to be a subtler comic than many of his peers (Jim Carey was associated with this picture at one point) and an outstanding actor: his transition from biro-pocketed nerd in the basement to swashbuckling global explorer is a joy to behold. For a little guy with sticky-outy ears, he is a surprisingly credible leading man. There is real chemistry between Stiller and Kirsten Wiig.That said, Walter Mitty is made by, features, and speaks to the people of a certain demographic - mine: mid-40s toilers who spend their private moments aghast that their lives are slipping away unremarked, and their public ones putting on brave faces and avoiding the inevitable conclusion that their toils might have been for naught.This film counsels not just seizure of the day, but also that it hasn&#8217;t been in vain: the beautiful, as Sean Penn remarks, don&#8217;t ask for attention.Ironically, Walter Mitty learns of his own beauty only when he flees his gilded cage. Only once he really has leapt from a helicopter into shark-infested water does he realise his life hasn&#8217;t been wasted after all. (Special mention, by the way, to that Icelandic bear of a man &Oacute;lafur Darri &Oacute;lafsson, here the drunken chopper pilot, whose extraordinary performance in the recent Icelandic feature The Deep has to be seen to be believed).Those not old enough to have acquired the humility to doubt their place in the firmament may find this all a little bit self-involved, but there will a big constituency among the rest of us for whom this film hits its mark. It is relentlessly big and beautiful: Stuart Dryburgh&#8217;s sparkling cinematography deserves as big a screen as you can find to see it on, and those receptive to its message will sit there for two hours with a big, dumb grin on their faces.Olly Buxton

The characters are so interesting and the actors that play them do such an amazing job


Every single episode leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat anticipating whats next.As far as the package itself, HBO did an OUTSTANDING job

The case is stunning


The pictures and texture of the case are great, and I was pretty shocked when I opened it up to find 5 discs! Most networks package TV show seasons very cheaply, with as few discs and other content as possible
This item was done very lavishly

The first season boxed set is worth every penny.

$review_text.: If you're a &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; fan, this is the film for you


The Federation's most deadly enemy, the Borg, are en route for earth --- and in &quot;Terminator&quot; style, they're headed to  earth's past to assimilate earth while they've still got technology worth  assimilating, but are too vulnerable to fight off the Borg's superior  firepower.Excellent performances by the entire cast including the  awesome Alfre Woodard and Oscar nominee James Cromwell.Relationships  among the crew (especially between Worf and Picard) are explored and  developed further


The friendship between Picard and Data is also put to  the test when the Borg Queen seeks to seduce them both with her promises of  power and perfection.The DVD is lacking in that it just has a couple of  theatrical trailers and that's it


It would have been nice to see some  behind-the-scenes footage, special effects, out takes, etc..


it's almost a  waste of the medium
 I first bought this on VHS, which included an  interesting motion photo of Picard, the Queen and Data (who morphs into an  assimilated Data when you tilt the image)..


the DVD doesn't have this cool  motion photo on the box/case

 I definitely prefer DVD to VHS because  (unless you set it on fire or let your dogs play frisbee with them) DVDs  essentially last forever and tapes are not a permanent medium and are  subject to skipping, tracking errors and eventually, decay


 It's nice that  you can quickly jump from scene to scene w/ a DVD and there is never a need  to rewind before you eject..


but other than the inherent advantages of the  DVD medium over tape, the DVD offers nothing else you can't view on the  tape
The tape version is also in letterbox format.Other than the lack  of extras, this film is awesome
I sat on the edge of my seat when I saw  this in the theater and I see it at least once a month now that I have it  on DVD
It is exciting and entertaining and definitely the best Star Trek  film yet.

$review_text.: This is a movie with many themes and they are woven into a warm blanket of understanding for the viewer.  It covers love, family conflict, dementia, growing up, growing old and growing wise.Norman Thayer (Henry Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) arrive at their summer cabin on the lake somewhere in the northeast.  They have owned the cabin for a long time.  Norman reads old newspaper clippings of his retirement as a college professor, a smart and respected man - and yet Norman does not recognize people in a framed picture or remember the telephone operator's name.  You see he is dealing with dementia and sometimes frustrated.  He is a proud man and covers up a lot with his cantankerous nature.This summer their daughter, Chelsea, (Jane Fonda) arrives with her fiance Bill Ray (Dabney Coleman) and his 13 year old son Billy (Doub McKeon) from a previous marriage.  They leave Billy with the Thayers as they want a romantic vacation in Europe together.Norman is grumpy but agrees to have Billy for the summer.  He is also thinking a lot about turning 80 and his health.  He has never understood how to raise a daughter and did not get along with Chelsea as a youngster - calling her "fat" and overall distant and unloving. Chelsea can't get the "chip" of his comments off her shoulder and move on - yet Norman may not live very long.Somehow, alone with Billy, Norman blossoms and also helps Billy to really enjoy his time at the cabin with two "old folks" - fishing brings Norman and Billy together.  When his daughter returns at the end of the summer, an understanding and reconciliation happens with her as well..Golden Pond and the Thayer's "golden years" deal with loss of health, dementia, aging through a wonderful cast and well-written script.  Jane Fonda's real-life issues with her dad Henry seem all too similar to those on the screen.  You wonder if she is acting or reacting to his cantankerous comments.  The three key actors, Katharine Hepburn, Henry Fonda and Jane Fonda, are a trifecta of talent.

$review_text.: Anyone who has read Lewis Carroll's classic children's tales will remember "Jabberwocky," the screwball poem about a young man slaying the fearsome Jabberwock. While there are some likable moments in "Jabberwocky," it never really pulls itself together.Dennis Cooper (Michael Palin) is disinherited by his about-to-die father, penniless, and inexplicably in love with the obese, potato-crunching, none-too-pleasant Griselda Fishfinger. So Dennis heads off to the city, only to learn that the fearsome Jabberwock, a horrendous monster that devours everything except the head and bones of its victims, is attacking the city.King Bruno (Max Wall) has promised his romantic-minded daughter's hand to the one who slays the Jabberwock, and the princess duly falls in love with the hapless Dennis. So somehow this "beamish boy" ends up being sent out against the Jabberwock in a horrific wasteland.It's hard to tell what the vision behind "Jabberwocky" was, but it came across as a limp spinoff of "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." It has the same grimy, icky medieval look, klunky knights and abundance of filthy beggars, but it doesn't manage to be similarly hilarious. Is it a farce? A dark fairy-tale? The evil twin of "Holy Grail"? I was never really sure, and sometimes I wasn't sure if Gilliam was either. He flipflops through all three.The Jabberwock is pretty good; though nobody could say it looks real, it's entertaining. The jokes are often either stretched out to the breaking point, or repeated over and over (like the urination joke). And while the tale of Dennis is engaging, there's no twist or offbeat quirk to make it really engaging. It proceeds and ends just as you'd expect it to.Michael Palin is the saving grace of the movie. He's wonderfully bewildered as events spin out of his control, especially when the princess greets him stark naked. Max Wall gives a pleasantly offbeat performance as King Bruno,So take up your vorpal blade, head off through the Tulgey Wood, and burble your way over to one of Gilliam's more cohesive works. This isn't one of them, unless you're a die-hard fan of Palin.

$review_text.: I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to blockbuster summer movies


 I don't expect the greatest scripts or characters or plot, I just want to be entertained


 SWAT let me down on all accounts and was practically begging for me to see its many flaws.The movie is good at the beginning, though


 It opens with bank robbers taking hostages and the SWAT team moving in and taking out the robbers one by one

 Colin Ferrel's character disobeys orders but turns on his partner in order to stay on the SWAT team


 Then the movie begins and that's when it breaks down.Samuel L Jackson arrives on the scene as a supposed ex-SWAT member who is brought back to restore dignity to the LAPD

 All this is covered in one line uttered by Jackson's superior, who happens to hate him and hopes he fails

 I have no clue why a separate SWAT team was needed to be formed when the regular SWAT team seemed to be functioning quite well.Jackson is allowed to choose his own team and much is made in the movie of him choosing each member

 Jackson's superior warns that if Jackson picks the wrong team, it'll end his career.The middle of the movie involves the training of the team
 On the way home from training, they stumble on a worldwide fugitive
 Through a forced and unbelievable plot, it becomes Jackson's young, inexperienced SWAT team's responsibility to transport the prisoner
 Here's where I started having doubts.The extended climax of the movie involves Jackson, Ferrell, Michelle Rodriquez and LL Cool J trying to transport the prisoner while all types of thugs try to break him free.There is a plot twist at the end where Jackson's team choosing ability is called into question, yet this has no repercussions in the movie, and it also calls into doubt the entire first half of the film when Jackson carefully chose his team
 How bad could he be?Why is this young inexperienced SWAT team in charge of the prison transfer

 Is that what SWAT teams really do
 I didn't think so.The final fight between Ferrell and the last bad guy is horribly filmed in the darkness of a train yard
 One minute the characters are in the open, the next they are on a train car


 The editing is jumpy and confusing, and I didn't really care what happened.When I think of SWAT, I think of the beginning of the movie when they save hostages from a terrorist situation with their long-range shooting and special skill
 The entire climax of the movie is about cops transporting a prisoner, certainly not worthy of a SWAT team
 This is a bad movie with no character development

 Don't buy it.

$review_text.: This is a greatly stylized translation to the screen from the novel by Leo Tolstoy. That is, it is a musical (or wants to be) and a rich tapestry of color, with a "painting" in nearly every scene. It's too much color for a tragic film like this. There is one scene that looks like a photo shoot for Vanity Fair. Pure white is not Tolstoy. As Anna Karenina, Keira Knightly plays the reckless Ann as a confident woman. Karenina was that, but we don't really get enough suffering from Knightly and Jude Law. They don't seem to gel compared to Aaron Taylor-Thompson and Alicia Vilkander. Their courtship is intense - a better match for the typical Russian angst that is Tolstoy.

$review_text.: Burn After Reading turned out to be a real pleasant surprise for  me. I had no real interest in seeing it as I've slowly become less and less enthusiastic about new Coen films over the last few years and felt quite let down over No Country which I feel is overrated.Still I rented it and am very glad I did. It's a typical Coen comedy with all the usual ingredients of silly / amusing characters, complex plotting and dark humour. It's not quite as zany or stylised as their earlier comedies like Raising Arizona or Hudsucker; here the characters are less cartoonish and the humour more sophisticated and in that respect has more in common with their more recent output like Big Lebowski, Intolerable Cruelty and Fargo.It's also slightly more low key than usual Coen comedy fare but is still full of invention and has a number of brilliant laugh out loud moments, mainly due to the excellent comedic mannerisms of both Clooney and Pitt. Actually, I thought Pitt was excellent, very innocent and lovably innocuous and his scenes where he tries to fish for a reward are pure comedy gold!Burn After Reading is the Coens on form for me, and it shows in the details. For example, who else would bother to make what could have been a rather mundane scene such as Pitt's character hanging out in a car waiting for a couple to leave their house, so subtly hilarious and memorable - again kudos to Pitt. When Pitt is inside the cupboard getting increasingly anxious, if you listen carefully, you can actually hear him wheezing! Hilarious! Again, the first encounter with the divorce lawyer (J.R. Horne), a short scene but made so fun because Horne was brilliantly funny and a typical Coen invention. There are so many comedic flourishes littered about, some very subtle, others more overt and in the end, it all rounds off to a very satisfying 90 minutes.There is a definite undercurrent of condescension which may be off putting for some though. You get the people at the top (here portrayed by the CIA and Russian embassy staff) being interrupted by these silly middle-aged people with their foibles, trying to make sense of all their shenanigans which in the end amount to nothing. Then of course you get Malkovic's speech at the end. It's difficult to say whether this is the Coen's showing a general disdain for people or whether it's them making fun out of their own middle-agedness. It's hard to say but either way, it's helped them fashion another comedic gem!

$REVIEW.: This is Julia Roberts best suspenseful legal thriller ever!!!!  With Denzel Washington their charisma &amp; chemistry are top notch.In summary Roberts plays a law student in New Orleans who writes a paper (&quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;) which theorizes a murder conspiracy involving the White House!  Naturally this draws attention to Roberts and proves to be true.  An intense manhunt begins. Roberts befriends an investigative reporter (Washington) and the chase &amp; suspense escalates.This movie &amp; script really shows the depth of Julia Roberts acting ability.  So if you want a very entertaining and nail biting movie get &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; today.  You'll watch over and over.
$SUMMARY.: If you like Julia Roberts you'll love this thriller !!!!!

$review_text.: I am not going to say this is the greatest movie ever made, but it is definately in the top 5 in the history of motion pictures. Humans fight monsters and sorcerors to save their beloved Earth. What could be more captivating?The acting in this movie is top notch. Sonja Blade is a thesbian of the highest calibur and could easily act in any movie, but that Lord Rayden that she decided to bring all her actressing skills to a boiling point as she mixed drama, action, and romance all into one role. Clearly an Academy Award winning performance.Johny Cage played his part so well, I went to the video store to try and locate an actual Johny Cage movie. His hilarious roll-on-the-florr humor will have tears falling from your eyes as you try to catch your breath, he is so funny. And he went through the entire movie without ever getting a single hair out of place, including his fight with Goro!Reptile, Scorpion, and Zub-Zero were the masked ninjas that brought even more depth to this already exhilerating film. With ice particles, killer spears, and body snatching at their dispose, how can our heros ever hope to win!! This is a must see film for any fan of Mortal Kombat, Kung Fu, or Bruce Lee.Move over Citizen Kane it is time for MOOOORTAL KOMBAT!!! to take the driver's seat.

$review_text.: I am not typically one for watching musicals, but this one appealed to me, no doubt thanks to the fact that it involved classic rock...that's something I can get behind!  I think the only other musical films I really cared for all that much wereSweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet StreetandDr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, plus the One More Time With Feeling episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Beyond that, I am not typically into musicals.Rock of Ages was a lot more enjoyable to me than a lot of musicals because of the classic rock numbers in it, plus this film contained some quality humor and I like the actors in it.  My wife was going to go and see the actual musical play with her mom and we figured we should give it a watch and it was pretty entertaining.  Check it out if you're into classic rock music and whatnot.

$REVIEW.: Michael Bay could learn a few tricks from Justin Lin who directs his 3rd franchise hit.  Lin brings back Vin Diesel as Dom who is clearly in charge of the operation once set free from a prison transport bus in the dynamite opening sequence.  Most of the usual crew is back including Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster.  They and a few others end up in Rio.  Once there, needing money, they hook up with a local crime mob to heist a few high end cars.  This sets up another remarkable stunt sequence that is as exciting as those usually reserved for James Bond movies.  Before I get too gushy about the movie, let's get one thing clear.  It is implausible, improbable, and perhaps even impossible.  The acting isn't all that great, the plot is stupid and the science behind some of the stunt work ain't there.  Yet, after being drawn in during the first 20 minutes, you're hooked. You will also see some of the best stunt driving ever.  I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Park your brain and settle in for the ride.  This is the best of the "Furious" films...by a long shot.

$review_text.: "Jack Reacher," based on Lee Child's popular seies of novels, stars Tom Cruise in the title role of a mysterious military investigator who looks into the murder of several civilians by a skilled sharpshooter. Reacher is a loner who solves crimes because he avoids falling into conventional thinking.  Having spent years as an Army cop, he now keeps a low profile, traveling under aliases and operating on instinct.  He knows the law often fails to provide justice, so he dedicates himself to getting that justice.Because Reacher has a photographic memory, it's tough for those he's pursuing to hide.  An occasional remark made days or even years ago remains fresh in his memory.In the novels, Reacher is 6' 4", a far cry from Cruise's stature, but his Reacher does an effective job conveying a self-confident swagger and handling himself more than competently when danger encroaches.  Cruise draws upon earlier action flick performances, so the viewer is familiar with the formula.  Under Christopher McQuarrie's direction, the movie offers lots of action, though the middle sags a bit.  Rosamund Pike co-stars as defense attorney and love interest Helen Rodin, David Oyelowo portrays a tough, confident detective, and Werner Herzog is a solid bad guy.The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains commentary by Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie and three behind-the-scenes featurettes.

Yes the novel may be more philosophical and the humorous observations of the adults that Pi knows more abundant.  The movie stresses the adventure, Pi is portrayed as more worldly, but its the CGI, the cinematography, and the fantasy aspects that are the building blocks of this version.

$REVIEW.: Season 5 of Roseanne starts out on a very morose note that corresponds to the deep recession the country was suffering at the time these shows were aired in 1992
Dan's motorcycle shop is failing and will have to be closed in order for him to salvage the mortgage on the Conner home

Rodbell's , the diner in the mall where Roseanne has worked for two years, is closing too, due to business in the mall being so bad

In order to make ends meet, the kids' college fund has been depleted so that Becky, while filling out college applications, throws a fit when she asks her parents about this fund and finds it no longer exists


Like any typical teenager, she is very upset when the harsh realities of life actually have an impact on her individual plans


Thus, she elopes with boyfriend Mark and moves to Minnesota, since with the closing of Dan's shop, Mark is unemployed too


Before she leaves though, she says some hurtful words to her father that basically blame all of the family's problems on him saying that her life has been ruined because Dan is a bad businessman

Everything hits rock bottom when the electric company turns off the power in "The Dark Ages", with Roseanne remarking that "Well, middle class was fun."The Conner family luck takes an abrupt turn upward when Roseanne's mother, having just finished divorcing Roseanne's father, decides to move back to Lanford and gives both Jackie and Roseanne each ten thousand dollars to do with as they please
Ultimately, though, even this is not enough for the two sisters to do what they really want - open up a diner in a now vacant building
Thus, they reluctantly invite their mother in as a partner in their business venture


She ultimately says yes - but not until she gives their dream her usual shellacking that she sees as motherly advice but comes across as disapproval bordering on contempt

With Becky now departed from the show, the role of David, Mark's brother and Darlene's girlfriend, is increased


We get a good look at his verbally abusive and often absentee mother in the Christmas episode, and his rocky home life is ultimately responsible for Roseanne taking David in to live with the Conners

The season concludes with Dan taking a job as supervisor with the city so that he can have a regular paycheck with benefits after Roseanne cracks a tooth, and the family has no dental insurance
Also, Darlene makes the announcement that she wants to go to school in Chicago where she can finish high school and begin college early at a really good writing school


This announcement is met with absolute resistance at first, but her parents soon realize that keeping Darlene at home will not bring Becky back to them, and they finally grant their permission


This sets up Sarah Gilbert in a recurring role for the rest of the series, since in reality she actually was starting college in the fall of 1993.There are some other outstanding individual episodes too, including the two-parter where Roseanne discovers that Jackie's younger boyfriend, who seems like Mr


Wonderful in public, has actually been beating her
Even though Jackie is an ex-cop she takes on the typical stance of an abused girlfriend by blaming the violence on herself


When Dan finds out, he decides to teach the young man a lesson with his own fists

Also, in another outstanding episode, Roseanne's father dies and she winds up sharing a drink with a woman who turns out to have been her father's mistress.Although I thought this season was excellent overall, there were a couple of points that bothered me.First off, there actually was a VERY bad recession going on in 1992, and I compliment the show for incorporating it into the storyline

However, the Conners' troubles came on very suddenly and were resolved with a very pat answer


In retrospect, it all seemed like a somewhat contrived attempt to help Bill Clinton get elected
Just as homeless people didn't seem to exist on TV until Ronald Reagan was elected president, it seemed like everyone in Lanford was on the road to starvation until the outcome of the 1992 election seemed inevitable, and then economic conditions suddenly normalized.The second point of contention is the sudden transformation of Roseanne's father into an abusive individual as pointed out in Roseanne and Jackie's comments during the episode in which he dies, and also in the episodes in which Roseanne compares David's horrible parents to her own parents
When Roseanne's parents came to visit at the end of season one, they both seemed like very nice but very annoying people, taking over the Conners' bedroom during their visit, and then waking them at 4:30 in the morning because this is the time of day that Roseanne's father must eat breakfast every morning, no matter what


There was no mention of any childhood trauma


This just seemed like Roseanne writing into the script the accusations she was making at that time about her own father, even if meant abandoning previous characterizations.However, these are minor points, and I feel the show handled all of the cast changes very well

I highly recommend this season of Roseanne to all who count themselves as fans of the show.

This crisis is not taught in English, French or American schools because this Soviet attack on Europe detailed in the DVD was a reply to the invading armies of the British, French, Americans, Italians, Japanese and ten other nations who had invaded the Soviert Union two years earler and were soundly defeated.Good settings, accurate period costumes and equipment down to the tiniest detail, very good actors.There is something for everybody in this movie, comedy, theater, combat, heroism and a love story. What is best it is not a work of fiction but entierly true.

$review_text.: The music, the directing style, the special effects, the lighting...that's right, it's the 80's, 1983 specifically, that brings us Twilight Zone the Movie.Yeah, as many have said, it was Spielberg's "optimistic" era of filmmaking, he had just finished making E.T

prior..

and so as many people point out his episode "Kick the Can" is very childlike and easily the most optimistic, or "sunny", of the 4 segments (the style of this episode was to me a blueprint for a lot of what later would become "Amazing Stories")In the meantime, the other stories are scarier...Of course the movie starts off with the famous John Landis segment (sadly, mostly remembered for the tragic accident) with the late Vic Morrow as the racist who suddenly learns what it is like to be on the other side of racism

It is directed in 80's Landis style and is not unlike his other films of that time as far as style goes, except for the serious tone of the subject


Landis mostly made comedies in the 80's "Spies Like Us", "Into the Night" etc,..which makes this episode interesting to see...Then there is the third segment with the creepy kid who can make anything he thinks of happen...this segment has some real nightmarish interesting design going on (the house having a picture on the wall of a family with no faces, etc), like a slightly nightmarish cartoon, and Yep the future voice of Bart Simpson Nancy Cartright is the ticked off older "sister"...the way the kid manipulates these adults into being his surrogate "family" is creepy and suspenseful, yet funny

The mechanical special effects of Athnony's "cartoon-like monsters" (created by effects expert Rob Bottin) for sure harken back to the 80's in the days before CGI


But to me, models and mechanical effects make the movies of the 80's what they were, and adds to the nostalgia factor in some ways...obviously the EFX, if the film was made now, would all be CGI ...anyways, Joe Dante who directed this segment would go on to make the much more successful Gremlins and so this is a sort of precursor to that ideaThe final story is as everyone says the best....John Lithgow as the worst nervous flyer ever known (besides me, I hate flying)-This is one of the most memorable movie roles he ever did...

 The gremlin on the wing of the plane is a trippy looking little creature...the directing, acting, & suspense in this sequence are the best of the 4 stories for sure-cool work from George MillerI saw this movie in the Theaters back when I was a 13 year old kid
As a movie fan who grew up during the heyday of Spielberg and George Lucas, I guess I consider this movie a classic for it's 80's "throwback" style...but I think it's production stands the test of time pretty well....I am glad to see this film on DVD and I hope there will be at least a few special features

$review_text.: I once had an SFC who used to ask the question "Yeah, soldier but what if ...?"  This film is the ultimate answer to what can happen if nobody in the Army demands answers to questions like "What if...?"  What if they know we're coming?  What if the enemy blockades the streets and trap us inside?  What if they shoot down two of our helicopters and we can't get to crash sites when we need to?  What if we're out numbered?  What if other U. S. Army units don't even know that we're going in for big military operation today?  What if our intel people have grossly under-estimated the Somali militia's ability to fight back?  What if we need more decisive military force than we originally planned for?  What if on our worse day and their best day we get our butts kicked?  What if there are casualties?  What if this mission actually takes more than 45 minutes?  What if we bit off more than we could chew?

$review_text.: My nonexistent ability to understand the Chinese language didn't hurt my enjoyment of this film


The mystery was a bit complex, but the action was nearly nonstop

The subtitles made sense in most cases, although I might have preferred good dubbing

There is just the right amount of comic relief that seems to be present in most recent action movies
That may help save the film from being gratuitously gory

Overall pretty good balance between the main characters.

$review_text.: The film incorporates Wikileaks as the new problem child for Moses Frank (Bruce Willis) and company. An article claims he and Marvin (John Malkovich) were involved in a 1979 operation called "Night Shade." They have become wanted men.In an expanded role Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) our meek lady from Kansas has become a thrill seeker and joins the group as they travel the world to find "Night Shade." In addition to Interpol and the Feds looking for our heroes, there is also a hitman (Byung-hun Lee) after them and Victoria (Helen Mirren) is also contracted to kill them...Malkovich proclaims "Friends don't take out a contract on friends."  They are allied by KGB agent Katja (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to the displeasure of sweet innocent Sarah who says..."Can't we just kill her?"The film is filled with Malkovich one liners which we enjoyed in the first movie. The expanded role of Sarah added to the feature. This is perhaps a notch below the first installment, but a worthy action-comedy sequel that will be in my collection when it comes out.Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. One half spoken f-bomb.

$REVIEW.: I never read the book, so I don't know how faithful an adaptation this film is, but I do know that it's an excellent little character study in its own right. Small, people-centered (rather than action-centered) films like this are increasingly rare, sadly, especially ones with such an impressive cast. It's sad that we've had to lose Paul Newman, but in one of his last central roles he absolutely eats up the screen as Sully, a cantankerous but likeable itinerant carpenter who has never managed to make much of himself. As he rebuilds his relationship with his son (Dylan Walsh), carries on a no-love-all-hate relationship with his boss (Bruce Willis), and flirts with an intimate relationship with his boss' wife (Melanie Griffith), Sully exemplifies the kind of small-town character that we've all known; no one says anything all that nice about them while they're here, but we miss `em when they're gone. The film also makes you feel the authentic cold of an upstate New York winter. Look for Philip Seymour Hoffman in a small, early role as a surly cop, and for Jessica Tandy in her last role, as Newman's landlady. She passed away before the film was released, and it was dedicated to her memory. She makes her final appearance on screen as notable as all the others in her distinguished career.

$review_text.: Chances are that those drawn to the DVD cover of Grande Ecole will want to see plenty of skin and they will, female and especially male.  The gender-bending plot concerns a French burgeois guy at a business school who is torn between three lovers--his human rights activist/literature student girlfriend, his upper-class French male roommate (who's engaged), and the hot, sexy, and sensitive Arab guy whose mother cleans at the school. The four characters start to cheat, tease, seduce and sleep around, and philosophize in a irrealistically pretentious manner.  It all leads to a final confrontation scene in which the French characters speak in some extremely pompous and irrealistic manner, even for a French film.The cast, however, is very good and physically appealing.  There's also plenty of eye candy, especially male frontal nudity and gay male scenes, none of which is hardcore.  Oddly, the most touching and moving character in Grande Ecole is also the most stereotypical: Mecir, the sexy Arab that seems to pop up in every French gay-male movie in the last decade or so, hopelessly longing for a French man and teaching the French that there's more to life than upper-middle-class values.

$REVIEW.: I saw this movie shortly after it came out in video form.  I thought it was an interesting idea.  I had a chance to see it last night with my 12 year old son and I enjoyed it again.  It has the rare quality of being a movie that can be enjoyed by people of different generations.  If you don't know the story, that's all the better.  The movie does an excellent job of filling us in on what's what.  We get a lot of the basics during the opening credits, see some of the "show" and get more helpful information as we go along.  The many role players that we see on the screen reinforce the idea that we, too, are now watching the same Truman Show that they are seeing.  We come on board at the time that Truman finally starts to figure out that things aren't what they seem to be.The way the movie lets us see the "acting" in the actors, the coordination of the technical staff, the quick reactions to unforseen changes in Truman's behavior all help to make the movie that much more enjoyable.  It also gives us a sense of the shallowness of the program itself.  That point was amplified when we get to meet The Truman Show's creator played by Ed Harris.  Certainly a large element of this movie is a poke at the nature of television; what we like to watch and why.  By corrupting the old adage "truth is stranger than fiction" we are led to understand that the human interest shows on TV merely take time away from living our own lives.  What is really strange is how television on so many channels these days seems to sense that "The Truman Show" was a harbinger rather than a satire.  We now find out way more that we should need to know about people who voluntarily place themselves in positions that require that them to bare their humanness.I thought about rating this movie a "5" based on its' originality.  However, I stopped short of that because I thought it ended before it had the chance to explore other possibilities.  Yes, there is only so much time in a movie to say so many things that simplicity is a virtue.  Nonetheless, I felt that the movie failed to fully challenge the potential of its' unique concept.  What it did give us was certainly worth watching.

$REVIEW.: How decent, brave, fairly naive kids get taken advantage of, is what this film invites us to think about. It is more a film about the psychological casualties of war stateside than about battle in Iraq. There is just enough battle to show why kids might have bad dreams and family problems when they get home, and so those scenes were necessarily condensed.This may be somewhat unrealistic, and certainly not representative for all soldiers, much as Jarhead may be not representative of everyone with regard to the boredom side of being in the military.I do think absolutely that we should honor men and women who enlist with their eyes wide open. But many kids tend to have their eyes wide shut and the system too often takes advantage of this. This has been explored in many films. Gallipoli is one of my favorites. In Stop Loss as in the Australian film Gallipoli the kids were rather simple boys. Stop Loss deals with more or less beer-drinking small-town rural kids who are basically robust and any disillusionment does not come to the surface on the battlefield, although they are getting some kind of wake-up but they are tough and adaptable and it stays within.The serious psychological conflicts erupt when they get back home for awhile. I think that the acting here of conflicted youth and the different individual ways of handling it (or not) is really great and the best feature of the film. Statistically sure not every soldier experiences post traumatic stress and/or family problems - but the point is that when it does happen, and it surely does! -- it can take many forms from subtle to quite overt.It is easier to remember the dead than the damaged. I find it offensive that we honor the dead as heroes and too often treat the psychologically damaged as though they are not full human beings but rather "weak," or "cowards," or "misfits." In this particular war we even seem to try to keep the physically damaged soldiers out of the public mind, and bring the dead back quietly to keep the coffins away from the media.Maybe this is the price of an all volunteer army, to keep the unpleasant stuff out of sight so that those kids who are naive will enlist with their eyes wide shut. Stop Loss offers kids an opportunity to think through some of the unpleasant things of which they may be unaware.But even for an older person like me I think the film was a very well done fictional exploration of some of the home front realities of wars and of the War in Iraq in particular.

$REVIEW.: Yu Gi Oh sadly has the Pokemon curse in that people who know nothing about it either assume it's for little kids (as marketing scams to buy cards, video games, and countless other garbage) or just hate it because it's the current fad.What they fail to realize is that the series is actually action packed, entertaining, dramatic, and overall a high quality series.What Yu Gi Oh is about is a young boy named Yugi after solving a millenium puzzle awakens an ancient Pharoh who is known as Yami.  One day his grandfather (who runs a game shop) shows off to Yugi and his friends an incredibly rare card, the Blue Eyes White Dragon.  Kaiba finds out and immediatly tries to buy it from him (despite the fact that he already has three of them).  His Grandfather refues and eventually it leads to Yugi and Kabais first duel.  Shortly there after the creator of Duel Monsters Pegasus steals Yugis Grandfathers soul as bait for him to go to Duelist Kingdom.  From there Yugi along with his friends must quest to get his Grandfathers soul back.The series like I said is action packed, funny, and dramatic.  It should be noted that the series was origionally not for kids but 4kids did a decent job of marketing towards the younger audience (because truthfully the series would have died if they did not, there still is not that strong of an anime market for this).  The series is fun to watch and it is very well written.  I look at it this way with any anime series, if it lasts more than one season than they have done something right.  Yu Gi Oh is an example of an anime series (on both shores) done right.  In truth this ranks in there with Dragon Ball Z, Tenchi Muyo, and although I am not a fan of the last, Sailor Moon in terms of longevity.  It lasted a number of seasons, so something was done right.  It may never beat out Pokemon (because that one has better games) but in terms of a series, this is probably one of the best in terms of all ages out there right now (maybe that will get american cartoon makers off their --- and come up with something new and fresh).

$REVIEW.: The Siege of Firebase Gloria is somewhat thin on plot but more than makes up for it in credible nonstop action. There are some technical flaws, but these are easy to overlook for the movie's entertainment value.The plot is loosely based on the (actual) Battle of Khe Sahn, and is quickly summarized: a battalion of regular Vietcong are amassing for an assault on Firebase Gloria. A USMC LRRP patrol (actually: no such thing existed; LRRPs were US Army) led by Sgt. Major Hafner is helicoptered to the firebase where he "relieves of command" the incompetent c.o. Captain Williams, and proceeds to fortify the base against the VC onslaught he realizes is about to be launched. He has no hope of reinforcement, since this happens when the rest of the US forces in Vietnam are being assaulted by the Tet Offensive.The Vietcong commander has problems of his own. He must secure victory without suffering excessive loss of troops, since this would allow the regular forces of North Vietnam to take away control of the war in the South.  Unlike all the other 'Nam flicks, F.G. portrays the enemy as something other than a nameless, amorphous collection of black-pajama Kalishnikov-wielders.There are many, though minor, technical errors throughout the film. It's not SOP for a USMC NCO to take command of an Army installation from an Army officer. There were never any nurses working on frontline fighting positions. None of the men on the base wear any rank insignia; Hafner and DiNardo are wearing tigerstripe camo uniforms. Another oddity is the green towel that Hafner is constantly wearing around his neck (definitely not standard issue). Sometimes others of the troops are also seen wearing the green towel. Go figure.Nevertheless, what's important is the combat, and this is portrayed rather well. The Gloria troops are obviously well-equipped with M79 40 mm grenade launchers, M60 portable machine guns, M18 Claymore mines, and some (including DiNardo) with the venerable M-14 chambered for 7.62 x 59 mm NATO. Contrary to one of the one-star reviewers here, there actually WERE a few still in use in Vietnam. The VC troops all seem to have the ubiquitous AK-47. The US Army Aircav is also well represented with UH-1 Hueys.Be forewarned that the film is filled with the usual foul-mouthed language used by soldiers in combat. There are quite a few wickedly humorous lines, though few repeatable at your next church social.All in all, your typical thin-on-plot shoot-em-up war flick, though outstandingly well done. Five stars.

$REVIEW.: First of all, I did purposefully avoid watching the programme when it first came out: I could not be convinced that in today's world TV producers had budgets big enough to do justice to such a story
I was pleasantly shocked! I watched the "Making of..." featurette before watching the actual series and could not believe how much the makers were able to create with so little
There was only one moment in the entire series where the low budget revealed itself and made me flinch: the Roman market in the moonlight looked drawn with a pencil..


 Employing Lithuanian mounted police with their own horses and recent military recruits as the Roman Army was a stroke of genius! So, two thumbs up to the quality of the production...(I will say nothing of the quality of the supporting cast; just watch it for yourself and you will be impressed!).With that said, the historical inaccuracies were unbearable..


Very quickly into the movie I decided to watch it strictly for its entertainment, rather then educational (which was none) value
This was more of a fairytale/love story, then an accurate reflection of the reality of those days....Last, but not least: Butler as the real Attila would have been a bust (for one thing, Attila is described by historians as short and, as a pure blood Hun, indefinitely ugly by western standards; Butler is 6'2" and, shall we say, MUCH closer to the current standard of beauty)


However, he made a charismatic hero of a fable...(though I could have done with less hair extensions and no eyeliner)

I wish the wardrobe department would have re-thought Attila's undergarmets

One in particular, a diaper like loin cloth, was just too much
Every time the diaper made an appearance, my house would echo with hysterical laughter (my viewing companion and I thought there was enough fabric there to fully cloth at least two grown men)
I am sure it was not the intention of the producers to turn Attila's romantic escapades into comedic entertainment, but...Anyway, entertaining story, as long as you do not look to learn anything historically factual from it, with a lead who is easy on the eyes..


Money well spent...

$REVIEW.: I have to give this film five stars for all the reasons that the other fans of this movie discuss.  This commentary is on an unusual glitch that I discovered with the DVD.  I'm referring to the MGM &quot;Contemporary Classics&quot; edition (in case there's another version out there).I was surprised to discover that, when the native people were speaking, some of the subtitling was left off.  Moments of indigenous dialogue were left un-subtitled in the VHS version (moments when a character appeared to be saying something like  &quot;Move&quot; or &quot;Hey, look.&quot;).  However, with the DVD, there was one scene where a bit of dialogue that was significant to the development of the plot went unsubtited, and we were all left in the dark.  It happened in only one significant scene, that I noticed, and eventually it was apparent what the character had said, but it was still frustrating and strange.However, I still recommend that you get the DVD.  When comparing scenes between the DVD and my old VHS copy (in order to see what had been said during the previously mentioned scene), I discovered that the old pan and scan version occasionally cut out almost 50% of the screen!  With a film this beautiful, this is intolerable!If you have this on VHS and are considering upgrading to DVD, I recommend that you do so - the visual pay-off is great!  But keep your hands on the old VHS copy, unless you know the dialogue from memory.

$REVIEW.: `Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest' released on `06 is the highly anticipated second installment of the Captain Jack Sparrow trilogy. While Captain Jack and the film doesn't retain the humor and lighthearted charm of the first film, it does compensate for the loss of innocence with a dark, haunting Lovecraftian vision and some of the most amazing special effects to date. Wait till you see the Kraaken.Make no mistake `Dead Man's Chest' does have some flaws. It doesn't quite hold your attention as well as the first, there are some undeniable slow sections and the film is a little too long overall. However it still contains lots of witty lines of dialogue from your favorite pirate and a surprising number of unexpected twists in the plots. The ending is absolutely perfect leaving you breathless for installment three. Ah that Disney really knows how to do it, don't they. Not as good as the first film, but it doesn't miss by much.

$REVIEW.: The Doom Generation (Gregg Araki, 1995)There are two types of people who have seen The Doom Generation: those who loved it and those who hated it
(Interestingly, the two groups, according to IMDB, who rate it highest? Males under 18 and females 18-29

Figure that one out, armchair Freudians.) While I definitely come down on the "hated it" side of the line, I can at least understand what it was Araki was trying to do with this movie

I just can't tell whether he utterly failed to do what he set out to, whether he succeeded in such an incompetent way that it doesn't matter, or whether he succeeded so brilliantly that my reaction to the film was exactly what he was going for


To make matters even more confusing, I'm leaning towards the third possibility
Why? Hindsight.While Araki isn't all that hot a director (cf


the failed, if valiant, attempt to adapt Mysterious Skin), the folks he plunked down in front of the screen are all that hot actors, as we have seen in the twelve-years-and-change since The Doom Generation was released; James Duval (basically discovered by Araki; his second film role was in Araki's first movie) has gone on to do some excellent work, Jonathon Schaech has gotten a decent amount of big-screen work in the past few years after an extensive television career, and, of courser, Rose McGowan went from being a Pauly Shore movie staple to an It Girl after Scream
Perhaps even more telling is the number of high-profile folks (actors and non-) who were drawn to Araki's script: Skinny Puppy, Perry Farrell, Amanda Bearse (of Married..

with Children), Nicky Katt (soon to become famous on Boston Public), Parker Posey, Christopher Knight (yes, Peter Brady), even Heidi Fleiss


All pop up in minor roles
They had to have seen something to get involved.The something, of course, is the whole alienation-angst thing that runs through the script


I mean, this is basically Ian Hunter's "The Outsider" brought to the big screen, with a really awful love story thrown into the mix and some really bad acting to propel it


But I don't think the acting was bad by accident

With these three actors? Oh, no, bub

I think Araki planned it that way
I think he told them to overact

Why? That's a bit more complicated

"To get the teen audience" is an easy, expendable, and probably oversimplified answer, though both Duval and McGowan certainly act like characters out of any number of awful teen goth poems I've read over the years


I think there's more to it-- the artificiality of the acting corresponding to the artificiality (or innocence, if you'd rather see it that way) of these characters; note that the two of them get better as the movie goes on (cf
Lindsay Crouse in Mamet's House of Games, who goes through the same transformation in much the same way)
Similarly, the cheap special effects and set decoration
Simply covering a bar in tinfoil? Genius, if you want to go for a cheap look.All that said, it doesn't diminish my visceral reaction to the film in any way


I still don't like it
If Araki didn't want me to like it, I can certainly respect that, and it's a valid enough reaction for a director to expect from a film; Hideshi Hino certainly isn't looking for legions of screaming fans when he directs movies

It just doesn't quite ring right, because man, if this film does have a target audience, I'm it


The cheap, dumb sets? I loved them in Carpenter's They Live


The bad acting? See my previous note on House of Games, which I think of as one of the hundred best movies ever made
And Skinny Puppy fans don't come much harder-core than me

Somehow, though, while I can appreciate the film on an intellectual level, I just don't feel it

Go figure

$review_text.: What can I possibly say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  I'm just sitting here, a day later, still blown away.Made in 1985, its predictions of a techno-future are eerily prescient while at the same time looking way cooler.  Or more probably filming was happening in 1984, since it has shades of that fine novel.  A hint of Clockwork Orange...And really, comparing it to anything else is just wrong.We have the menacing future, yet we have some powerfully conceived and brilliantly acted characters, in a plot that's fast and fascinating, along with what the cover rightfully calls biting humor.  I was constantly laughing in the most inappropriate places, precisely as intended.I don't give many five-star reviews.  That means I'm keeping the movie and watching it again (and again).  In this case, at the end of its 2 hours and 23 minutes, I really wanted to play it again immediately.Oh yeah, and top notch special effects that'll blow you away, and the kind of sets I really wish I could've guarded back in my security guard days.But I digress.  Get this movie.  It'll definitely live up to your expectations, and then some.

$review_text.: Rites of Passaage, directed by Victor Salva, is a movie about Del (Dean Stockwell) coming to tems with the mistakes he made with Campbell (Jason Behr) his gay son. The past is revealed to the viewer in flashbacks and you begin to understand the past trouble as Del is a tough guys guy and viewed his son kissing and hugging another man. Thrown into this brew is some action/suspense when you have a psychopathic killer /escape convict (James Remar) and his sidekick hiding out around the moutain cabin where Del and his sons are camping out. As the stories twist and turns more secets are exposed under the light of truth and characters are seen with a whole new perspective.The movie has several good points: the beautiful lake and forest sets for a secluded postcard appearance, the actors are all easy on the eyes and the script is not over acted. However, what knocked a few stars off was even though the acting was fine the script directs the father to have this soul searching / big hearted change for his son (even after 2 years of silence), not to mention that Del and Campbell go back and forth at yelling which really doesn't lead to anything but exhaustion for both the script and the viewer. Also, the whole idea of Campbell having something to do with the convict was a stretch to including the boat scene (why go out on it in the first place). All in all, Rites of Passage comes across as a bearable journey that has a lot of emotion and power but lacks a tight focus.

$review_text.: I'm a huge horror movie fan & no one can deny that these 4 are true classics. Horror films today are very different from what they used to be, it's nice to have a look back at the old ones & see the progression over the years.The DVDs: Good condition, ideally they'd be BluRay, however, that'd cost a lot more money & they didn't have this exact set available on BluRay anyways. Unfortunately, I was so excited about the DVD set that I didn't realize they're all Full-Frame, I prefer Widescreen & from what other people have said, it seems most people do as well; this is why I rated it 4/5 instead of the full 5/5.Packaging: They come in a standard DVD case, so it's nothing overly exciting, but I didn't need overly exciting to make me happy. I love how all 4 DVDs fit in the 1 case, this saves a lot of room on my DVD shelf.Overall: For the price, it's a great addition to the collection. I could've paid $8.99 for Creature from the Black Lagoon alone, or for just a few dollars more add the rest of the monster crew, the choice was obvious. I recommend this, however, if you're a big spender, go for the BluRay collection which has a lot more movies, but again, it's about $90-$100 (depending where you buy) so it'll set you back a fair bit, but again, you get more movies. Being a fan of all 4 of these movies, I'm content with this set.

Love what's being released and would definitely grab Lost Horizon if made available as a pressed DVD or Blu-ray. It's one of my favorites and I'm impressed at all the energy that went into this release, especially with finding the lost footage and putting it back into the film. Nice job!

Of course, if you're a parent who would appreciate not exposing your little one to excessive violence, then you still might want to give this one a pass.I really expected more from it considering it boasted the talents of Hoffman, Jolie, and McShane. Mostly the adults in the room were totally bored and ready for it to be over. Kadden, the three-year old, had a ball with it.If you must see it, borrow or rent.

On a personal note: I'm back with all new reviews some new and old PPVs


If you haven't notice, I have deleted most of my reviews
I did about 90% of them by memory and that's not fair to the event to do that
So I deleted everything from 2002-Present so I can make a more fair review for every PPV event
This is the first of my new and improved reviews
I will re-do all of my reviews, I just don't know when

So thanks and I will be back soon with another review

$REVIEW.: I am all for personal choices and the freedom to express individuality, but because of my genetic make-up, I never felt a romantic love for the same sex, so I didn't quite grasp the concept of " you love who you love". After watching this movie, I truly understand that love is not about gender, just the same way that it is not about color, or class. Its about the person you fall fir.  I also thought it was incredibly tragic how the two of them were kept apart and never allowed to live the life of their choosing bc of some caveman mentality. I am happy that we have come along way since then. Beautiful love story.

$review_text.: A psycho (played by John Malkovich) plans to kill the President, and Clint Eastwood, an aging, almost over-the-hill secret service agent, is trying to stop him. Malkovich torments Eastwood - Eastwood was on duty protecting Kennedy when he was shot in Dallas, and he didn't react accordingly when the shots went off; Malkovich knows it and drives him batty about it. Eastwood's been carrying that psychological scar ever since, and now he has a chance to redeem himself.In many of Eastwood's movies it's hard to sympathize with him because he's either so cruel and antagonistic or else almost unscathingly superhuman; here he does win our sympathy because finally he IS more human and like the rest of us: he's out of shape, he gets the flu, it takes a while to win the girl (Rene Russo). It's a nice change. There is nothing unique about the story or the way the plot unfolds: crazy man on the loose, Eastwood and cops try to track him down - though it's done very well. The tension is maintained, yet the director (Wolfgang Petersen) takes time to develop the characters, especially Eastwood. Of course there's the wow finish: Eastwood takes the bullet meant for the President (he's only wounded), thus redeeming himself. It's a very well-done thriller; definitely worth a watch.

$REVIEW.: I got his movie for my two little nieces because I knew they would love it and they did, and so did I!  This is a delightful and fun filled movie where the Wild Thornberries and the Rugrats meet up in an adventure of a lifetime.Stranded on a tropical island after their boat capsizes, the Rugrats and their families have to survive in an environment to which they are not at all suited too but help is at hand in the guise of the Wild Thornberries who just happen to be in the area on one of their jaunts.The adults squabble and bicker (but they all make up and work together when the children are in danger) whilst the Rugrats lurch from one crazy adventure to the next and we are treated to Spike the dog speaking for the first time (Bruce Willis) because everyone knows that Eliza Thornberry has a wonderful secret, she can speak to animals and they understand her and can speak back!It's a nice movie because it brings together two great animated series, it also is a fun film that young kids can watched and be enthralled with, that is what I like about it the most, it is an enjoyable cartoon romp for the whole family.

$REVIEW.: This charming romantic comedy about a has-been pop singer (Hugh Grant), who enlists the help of a writer turned reluctant lyricist (Drew Barrymore) to help revive his career, is great fun. The film is genuinely funny. It's tender and romantic without being overly sentimental. The casting couldn't be better. Grant in a "nice boy" role this time around is very warm, funny, and likable. Barrymore is even more adorable than usual as the neurotic and lovable, amateur lyricist. The musical performances, and songs featured in the film are also highly entertaining especially the theme song, "Way Back into Love". The film may appear to be a chick flick on the surface but it really has something for everyone.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More

$REVIEW.: We rented this mainly because we like documentaries and this was supposed to be a good one. I was very impressed, and also moved. I remember not being able to stand the sight of this woman back in the 80's, and being extremely satisfied when the Bakker's empire crumbled very publicly. Maybe I just got sick of hearing about them, and the media did not exactly paint a flattering portrait. I started out this movie feeling pity for Tammy Faye, but began to admire her as it went on. I had no idea she was gay-friendly way before it was fashionable to do so(and even now, I don't think there are too many gay-friendly televangelists), and had no clue that she had a TV talk show with an openly gay co-host. Not to make media headlines for being 'daring', either. With many other celebrities, you get the feeling they figured out, &quot;Hmmm, gay men seem to really love me, I think I'll use this and cash in on it&quot;. With Tammy it's clear that she is not calculating at all but just a very friendly person with no prejudice. The movie, narrated by RuPaul, chronicles her life, and gives her side of the story of the scandals. There are interviews with her current and ex-husband, and many of her friends, people she worked with, and biographers. The film includes great archival footage of her early television shows (if you think she has big hair *now*, just wait) to her later ones. The movie is divided up into chapters that are introduced with sock-puppets (this is not as ridiculous as it sounds, though the movie has plenty of humor). In one scene Tammy confronts a reporter who wrote a very unflattering, and Tammy says untrue, book about the PTL Empire. This and several other scenes are hard to watch (though it's fun to see the reporter stammer when Tammy asks him point blank why he printed lies about her). In another scene I felt like watching through my hands over my eyes, during a point in her life when she was addicted to prescription drugs, we see Tammy sort of wandering off in the middle of a broadcast to remark on the backdrop, pretty whacked out. When I found out the circumstances that led to her doctor prescribing something to calm her down, I wasn't disgusted but more surprised that she wasn't taking every narcotic she could get her hands on at the time. I remember thinking back in the 80's that anyone who walked around looking like Tammy and carrying herself confidently was out of their mind, or at best, delusional. At some point during the movie- probably a scene where she cheerfully pitches ideas for TV shows to someone probably 20 years younger than her at the USA Network (you get the feeling maybe he won't make fun of her as soon as she's out the door, but it's easy to imagine him having a good laugh with someone he knows later as he tells them about his encounter)- I realized she is just, well, being herself. She knows that her heavy eye makeup is &quot;her trademark&quot;, and is proud of it. Let's face it, it takes real guts for this woman just to walk down the street when most people consider her a punchline, a cartoon, a freak, or all three. She is not a stupid woman and knows this, but holds her head up high anyway, and carries herself proudly. How many people would be brave enough to do that? I never thought I'd say this, but after seeing this, I have a newfound respect for Tammy Faye. If the film-makers intentions were to have people view the subject of their documentary in a different light, then they did an excellent job, and I don't have any complaints about it at all. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about Tammy (even if only out of morbid curiousity, like I did at first) and loves a fascinating, touching documentary. Be sure to wear waterproof mascara when watching it, though. A note on the DVD-not much in the way of extras, though it does include the theatrical trailer. However, I'd still recommend it wholeheartedly.

$REVIEW.: This show is not the funniest, but I loved the two aunts and of course, Salem, the talking cat.  I think if it wasn't for my attraction to the two aunts and the cat, I may not have been a fan of the show.  The 7th and last season is a real downer with the aunts only appearing once or twice in the whole season.  Another drawback to Sabrina is the laugh track, laughing at stuff that just is not funny.  But if families are looking for wholesome entertainment, this would be the show for them.  I'm in it for the supporting cast rather than the star.

$REVIEW.: Having not read the book, I watched the movie in hopes to learn more about this conflict and the ensuing nightmare for the U.S. forces engaged in the operation.Wether you agree or disagree as to the U.S. involvement in this struggle, the loss of 300,000+ lives due to starvation would make any red blooded American's blood boil and demand U.S. assistance in this ordeal.  A lot of people say that we (U.S.) gets involved in issues that aren't any of our business, but I differ in this regard.  If we (Americans) sat silent while a country is obliterated so violently then we would not be the America that our soul foundation is based upon.I view this movie from two fronts (1) its a movie about the U.S involvement in Mogadishu and (2) the tale of the heroic soldiers of Delta Force and the Rangers.  These men go into the most dangerous conflicts in the world without question, they defend our (U.S.) interets and do it with honor.This movie delivers in both regards, it justifies our involvement at a high level and then depicts the heroisim of Delta and the Rangers in "arguably" the most intense fire fight since the vietnam war.&lt;spoiler coming up, don't read if you don't want to>This movie provides a very emotional roller coaster. I had a lump in my throat the size of a baseball when two Delta Force Snipers MSGT Gary I. Gordon and SFC Randall D. Shughart injected themselves at the second Black Hawk crash site to provide protection to the wounded in what was surley a no win situation.  They gave their lives defending their brothers in what has to be a most selfless act I have witnessed.  They both received the medal of honor posthumeously.I am now going go read the book which I hope goes into greater detail than that movie could.I would suggest watching this movie with your children (appropriate age) because of the graphic nature.  But our children need to understand how important our country is and why men and women defend our country.

$review_text.: This black and white film war film was made in 1943 for propaganda purposes and it was one of better Hollywood WWII morale raisers, mostly, but not exclusively, because of stellar performance by Humphrey Bogart. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.1. Origins and descendance of &#34;Sahara&#34;This film traces its roots to a short novel called &#34;Patrol&#34;, written by Philip MacDonald, a British veteran of World War I. It told the story of a group of eleven British soldiers surrounded by hostile Arab tribesmen in a small oasis in the middle of Iraqi desert, during 1918 Mesopotamian campaign. The novel became popular and was adapted to the screen first time in United Kingdom as a silent movie in 1929, under the title &#34;Lost patrol&#34;. The film was quite good, Hollywood noticed it and in 1934 John Ford directed an American remake. His version, named &#34;The lost patrol&#34;, became a worldwide success, thanks in large part to the amazing performances of Victor McLaglen and Boris Karloff.Amongst people who loved this film the most was Stalin himself, who, unknowingly to most people, adored American cinema - when in the same time refusing his subjects the right to watch those &#34;decadent&#34; movies. Stalin enjoyed greatly those private s&eacute;ances in Kremlin's projection room during which he could relax between two campaigns of mass murder... &#34;The lost patrol&#34; pleased him so much that he ordered a Soviet remake, and it was indeed turned in 1936 and released in 1937, under the title &#34;The Thirteen&#34;.Soviet director Mikhail Romm changed of course the story, transferring the time of action to Russian Civil War (1917-1922) and the place of action to Central Asia deserts. The total number of defenders of the oasis was increased to thirteen (a number considered as unlucky in Russia too), including eleven Red Army soldiers and two civilians. The enemies were Central Asian Muslim tribesmen led by White Armies counter-revolutionary officers. Stalin liked this film too and as result Mikhail Romm wasn't executed or send to a concentration camp during the Great Terror (1934-39) as so many of his colleagues...Then came December 1941, United States entered war and soon became allies of Soviet Union. Hollywood started a mass production of patriotic flag waivers the day after Pearl Harbor and in the end of 1942, with all the excitement around the operation &#34;Torch&#34; and battles of El Alamein and Stalingrad, somebody had the idea of making a film which would celebrate the allied soldiers fighting in the desert when in the same time being a nice gesture towards the Soviets - a Hollywood adaptation of &#34;The Thirteen&#34;.The film, released ultimately in November 1943, became a great success and was later remade twice more: in 1953 as a western &#34;Last of the Comanches&#34; (a.k.a. &#34;The sabre and the arrow&#34;) and in 1995 again under the title &#34;Sahara&#34;, with James Belushi taking over the main role once played by Victor McLaglen in 1934 and Humphrey Bogart in 1943.2. The filmThe action of this film takes place in 1942 immediately after the battle of Gazala (26 May - 21 June), which was Rommel's greatest and most brilliant victory ever - therefore ipso facto it was also a particularly difficult time for the British forces in North Africa, as their great fortress of Tobruk was lost and they were forced to retire deep into Egypt... In this film it was decided to add some American troops to British 8th Army even if in reality not even a single US soldier fought in North Africa before the operation &#34;Torch&#34; in November 1942.Therefore, at the beginning of the film we can see five American trying desperately to repair their damaged tank &#34;Lulu Belle&#34; to avoid capture by Germans. Their leader is Sergeant Joe Gunn played by Humphrey Bogart in person. One the crewmembers, Fred Clarkson is played by Lloyd Bridges who, even if he is today more remembered for his &#34;Airplane&#34; and &#34;Hot Shots&#34; comedy roles in the 80s and 90s, was already in this time an experienced actor and since he began his career in 1936 &#34;Sahara&#34; was already his 43rd film!A little bit later in the film the five Americans will be joined by five &#34;Limeys&#34;, a Sudanese sergeant from British Army, his Italian prisoner and a Free French corporal. The presence in this time and in this place of Free French troops, which fought excellently at Bir Hakeim, a battle waged in the same time as the greater Gazala fight further north, is actually a historical fact. The last to join this group - very, VERY unwillingly - will be a Luftwaffe pilot, whose plane was shot down. Those fourteen ill-assorted companions and &#34;Lulu Belle&#34; will try to make it back to allied lines by going through the deep desert, when avoiding roaming German patrols, some of them pretty large and heavily armed. Then, of course, they will at one moment find a little abandoned oasis with a very small but incredibly precious water hole... And then the film really begins.3. My general impressions about the filmIt is a rather good war film and it is always a pleasure to watch Bogie in any film - as far as I am concerned I would watch him even in a commercial for broccoli...))) The desert and the abandoned oasis are very well filmed and the black and white actually adds to the charm of the film rather than diminishing it. Action scenes are not half bad, even if they are NOT so many and the ending is particularly STRONG!That being said, the propaganda character of this film is obvious from the beggining to the end and many dialogs are actually just the recitation of slogans - and with time it becomes a little bit annoying. I found also amusing and very naive the attempts to explain that ultimately Christianity and Islam (the Sudanese sergeant is Muslim), well, it is more or less the same thing...))) The German pilot character is so evil that he is obviously a total caricature - as is, in the different register, the hapless and pathetic Italian prisoner Giuseppe...4. Lulu BelleThe tank which carries the heroes deep into the desert and is their main weapon against the wandering Germans hordes is a M3 Lee, a medium tank introduced into service in US Army in August 1941, of which many hundreds were delivered to United Kingdom as part of lend and lease agreement. The M3 Lee was quite heavily armored and powerfuly armed, with one 75 mm and one 37 mm gun, as well as four machine guns. It took no less than six men to operate a M3 Lee. Many of those tanks took part in battle of Gazala and they performed well, as they were actually more powerful than Wehrmacht's Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks used in this time - still, Rommel's superior tactics allowed Germans to destroy and capture most of British tanks at Gazala. The M3 Lee and its improved version, M3 Grant, served in first line until the end of war in North Africa in April 1943 - after that, all the survivors were replaced by the much superior M4 Sherman.At least 1300 of those tanks were also delivered to Soviet Union beginning with the end of 1941 and initially they served well, but with the arrival in summer 1942 on the Eastern Front of German new Panzer IVF2 tanks and Pak 40 75mm anti-tank guns, they became much, much more vulnerable. In 1943, with casualties mounting, their Soviet crews started to call them &#34;Six brother's grave&#34; but so great were the needs of Red Army that they continued to be used in the first line until the apocalyptic Kursk battle in July 1943. After this monumental fight the few that were left were send to secondary sectors, like Arctic Front.This film is definitely the best occasion for all military history freaks to see a M3 Lee in action - a lot!CONCLUSION: for all reasons explained above, this is a quite interesting war film. Not exactly a masterpiece, somehow aged and certainly damaged a little by the heavily served propaganda, but still quite worth seeing. Enjoy!

Wow, I couldn't get past that enough to even concentrate.  This guy is leading a boot camp dvd? What a joke! Also, it's NOT boot camp at all. It's pretty basic moves that most people already know.

$REVIEW.: I too was a bit thrown astray when I found out that the Teen Titans were getting an entire new series based off of anime chibi-styled comedic versions of themselves. However, upon viewing a few episodes, it's not half bad. It's funny, pokes some jokes at the old series, and just tries to give the viewers a fun and entertaining 11 minutes, which it does a pretty good job of doing.For all the haters out there, look, I get where you're coming from. You hate to see the awesome, butt-kicking characters you know and love turned into purely comedic characters. I get it. But here's why you shouldn't be mad simply because of that:-This series has nothing to do with the old series. Other than the fact that it's the same team and they have the same voice actors, this is not a continuation of the story in the old series. This has nothing to do with the old series at all.If you don't like it because you just don't think it's that funny, that's fine. But don't hate it simply because it's a comedic version of something you liked. Imagine if they made a similar cartoon but with Batman, and he was still voiced by Kevin Conroy. Would you still be mad? Would it be tarnishing the awesomeness that is Batman The Animated Series? Of course not. Heck, if there was ever a series like that, I personally would see it the second it premiered. Why? It has nothing to do with the old series, and is just a comedic version.Again, I understand for those that still refuse to like it simply because of this, but don't blame Cartoon Network for &#34;turning the Teen Titans into these childish toon characters!&#34; The old series is still there, this is not a continuation and has no link to the old series at all. They didn't turn them into anything as this isn't a continuation to that story. They /created/ something new based off of an older series.

This movie will piss you off

Not only will you want to throw the kids in prison for a minimum of 5 years but it will change the way you look at entertainers and how careless and stupid they are with their own belongings
Let's just say the 1% have it good

$REVIEW.: In the late 1970s I saw women wearing "Itty Bitty Titty Committee" t-shirts, as if they had to apologize for having slight builds.  The contemporary film ITTY BITTY TITTY COMMITTEE reminds us not enough has changed as its opening scenes depicts lead character Anna working for a cosmetic surgeon catering to women who want to make a besty chesty investy.While it has its point about the state of double standards in America, ITTY BITTY TITTY COMMITTEE entertains AMERICAN GRAFFITI-style as young Anna, chancing upon a small female activist group trying to raise awareness and make a name for itself, comes of age.  The common ideals of the women up against interpersonal drama (lesbian love triangles, to name one distraction) and zero budget, Anna and her new friends see more growing pains than success as the organization attempts to reach the public.  As the film concludes, perhaps you'll agree these women can still claim victory in the experience they shared.ITTY BITTY TITTY COMMITTEE holds your attention throughout.  It may be no surprise to find yourself rooting for both the group to hit it big and Anna to figure out where she belongs.See ITTY BITTY TITTY COMMITTEE.

$review_text.: I'm sorry, but this movie misses the mark with me. Too much of this movie TRIES to be cute and funny and clever, and when the trying shows, it's a sure sign that it's not working.Some performances are spot-on. Almost all the bit parts are done beautifully. Tom Nardini as Jackson Two-Bears is outstanding and charming. But although Lee Marvin got an Oscar for his dual role as Kid Shelleen and Tim Strawn, I felt he was just too over-the-top to match the rest of the cast. Obviously the director didn't know how to rein him in...or chose not to.I don't praise the "wandering minstrels" Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole; rather, I find them annoying, intrusive, jarring, and self-serving. As for the songs they sing, for the most part they're eminently forgettable.

$review_text.: Let me start by saying I ADORE Kevin James.The King of Queens (Seasons 1-8)is one of my favorite sitcoms. And that being said, I will admit that his voicing of a male cow with udders make me think less of the movie. I know others have said it doesn't matter, and maybe it doesn't. But even my 10-year-old son noticed that, for a male bull, it sure looked like a female cow.The movie itself is fun in some parts, absolutely hilarious in others, and so-so most of the time. For a family film, it's okay, but there are better ones out there. And when you see a male cow with udders becoming a father to a calf for the first time, it just does something (not pleasant) to the overall effect.

This film is another testimony to the acting strength of Charlie Sheen who really drives the plot of this film as the obsessive lead character.  The supporting characters are great too in keeping the story going and getting buy in from the viewer.It has one of those open ended, hanging endings that I love when they are done right.  They leave the viewer wondering what might happen, not with the shameless plug for the sequel which sadly they did make.The picture and sound are great and on this pressing, so is the price.

$review_text.: I should be amazed that this show gets such rave reviews, but given the low standards of the TV industry in general and as a result, most viewers out there, I'm not.Grey's makes the medical establishment look like a bunch of hormonal, preoccupied, inept sex junkies.  It's ridiculously unrealistic, both the medical scenes and the behavior of the staff.  And WHERE are all the nurses?  Like hospitals are run by MDs?And WHERE was the floor staff when Denny had his stroke??  No one was there to respond?  Even before that, don't you think the hospital would've canned and sued anyone and everyone they even perceived was involved in the cutting of his cord, immediately?  That is blatant malpractice.  COME ON.  This show is beyond pathetic.I started watching because I was so impressed with Jeffrey Dean Morgan in his other series, "Supernatural" (a MUCH better show, by the way).  I was also curious to see what all the fuss was about.What I found was nothing but disappointment.  The only light shining in this whole season was Denny.  JDM did a great job, wasn't too shabby to look at either, and the story involving him was sweet.  Lucky for him that they killed off his character though, because he deserves better than this.  With Denny gone, I'll never watch this lame show with it's annoying characters again.

$REVIEW.: If you have somehow missed seeing this terrific action film with Harrison Ford and the inimitable Tommy Lee Jones (he won an Oscar for this role), then waste no time and see it now. It's a terrific update of the popular 1960s TV series of the same name, based on the real-life story of a surgeon wrongly accused of murdering his wife. In one of the most sensational action sequences ever filmed, Ford escapes from a the scene of a horrible wreckage (bus vs. train) as he is enroute in the bus to prison.And off he goes, dodging the law (Jones) at every twist and turn, to find the real killer on his own.Not only is it a great action thriller, however; it's also an intense and spellbinding character study, well-suited to the personalities of the two stars who play so well the roles of hunter and hunted. They come, of course, to have a mutual respect for each other.Watch it now.

Of course Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes is smooth, solid, and believable (I think I am falling in love with his craggy face), and same goes for Russell Crow

$review_text.: What can I say? This is one of my all time favorite films. It's a vampire story but not of the traditional kind. In this one Catherine Deneuve's character is the main vampire who seduces a lover who can only really live in youth for a couple of centuries and then they age rapidly and end up in a kind of limbo of no death and no life. In this story her current partner, David Bowie, is starting his aging process and she must find a new partner. She then fixates on a Dr., played by Susan Sarandon, who is doing research on the aging process whom her lover, David Bowie, goes to in desperation to stay young.I normally don't like vampire films, but I loved the whole ambience of this film. This film is very dreamy, sensual, erotic, ethereal, and a feast for the senses. Catherine Denueve is perfectly cast as Mariam. She radiates a really cool exterior yet there is a warmth that comes out as she does mourn the loss of her current lover. And for sure her French accent only adds to that character's appeal. The seduction scene is one of the most erotic I've seen in any film. David Bowie is perfect too as the aging lover. He gives a truly heartbreaking performance as his desperation to keep living mounts. Susan Sarandon was the only person who I felt was a bit miscast here. What was with the hair?For those who like the blood thirsty part of vampire films you might be disappointed. There are some really disturbing scenes in the beginning of the film, very dark and gritty, and then again towards the end. But for the most part this is a non graphic film. For those who like the romanticism of a vampire story, this is the film for you.

 One of the most amazing creative forces of the human psyche is our ability to create worlds, worlds that are sometimes anything like our own

 I want something new to explore and products like "Last Exile" or games like Mass Effect provide that for me in a huge way!  That being said the art and elements are beautiful to behold in this series.Meet Claus and Lavie, two young Vanship pilots that are about to embark on the grandest journey of their lives
 They've been good friends since they were just kids and they were taught to fly Vanships from their parents
 All they've ever wanted to do was fly the skies
 To make money they would be couriers for special messages and as they got better they would take messages with a higher danger rating for a better rate of pay

 One day a seven star danger rating suddenly falls in their hands in the guise of a little girl named Alvis

 Unbeknownst to them their destiny was so much more than they ever believed and their cargo so much more precious!  This is their journey of how they wound up on the Sylvana with her quiet captain Alex and would then be caught in the middle of a fight for freedom against The Guild and their leader Delphine

 As you can see this is a pretty in depth tale with a great deal of character development
 I think it's a testament of the writers to expertly craft in this much character development amidst such an engrossing story line.Once you get pulled into the world of "Last Exile" you don't want to stop watching, nor do you ever really want to leave
 You feel like you're on the journey with each and every character, involved to the bitter end, which is tragic for some


 I was especially disappointed with Dio's tragedy


 He was one of my favorite characters, he was so eccentric and somewhat out of place that he just belonged

 I did like all the other characters in this though, they all just worked so well that you actually wanted to join in and be a part of the Sylvana's crew as well


 Their journey focuses on a single goal to find a very special ship called Exile

 This ship will apparently allow them either salvation..
or if The Guild gets a hold of it, it will only enable them to tighten their grip even more!  I guess the one part I would've liked the show to delve into more was about Exile's origins and the origins of the land they're in

 Judging by the ending, there's a lot more to the story than what we only see

 Which just leads me to more questions about how The Guild came to have such great power?I have this great theory about how the people got in this very strange world


 If you notice all the writing is using Ancient Greek characters
 It might not all be the correct words, but it does inspire me to try and figure out what happened to these people


 I think in ancient times they ended up somehow getting out to this different part of the universe and their entire culture developed independently


 This would explain why the language doesn't appear to evolve much beyond where it was long ago
 It also explains the development of all this technology as well
 Well it's just a theory, but I just might be right!"Last Exile" is a wonderful fantasy story mixed in with definite science fiction themes

 For the most part it stays away from being a total science fiction story

 It's based around flying air ships that are more akin to those that float in the water than what you would see for space ships


 It's not a wholly new concept; I mean Gulliver's Travels had a sort of similar concept
 Some of the armies even use British fighting tactics where they stand in a line on the deck of the ship and just fire at the enemies!  When that line falls, the next steps up


 "Last Exile" has a TON of influences from all over the spectrum
 If anything I've mentioned thus far seems very intriguing then I would say don't hesitate to try this out!  This particular edition came with a small figurine of Alvis and a mouse pad, but the best part was the booklets in the DVD cases
 There are seven DVD's and each came with a fold open detailed schematic of the different ships
 Unfortunately this doesn't cover ALL the ship designs we find in "Last Exile" which was a little disappointing, but I wasn't expecting to get any of these at all!  So it was quite a pleasant surprise

 What do you say?  Ready to take a ride with Claus and Lavie on their Vanship?

$REVIEW.: Its something of a mystery as to why anyone would want to remake the original George Romero film The Crazies. It was a very forgettable film, but the premise was a good idea. In the case of this remake Breck Eisner managed to improve upon the story and make it worth seeing. I found the film to echo numerous similar stories, and there really isnt anything new that comes to play here. Added to that are the usual familiar formulas with less than plausable sequences that expect the audience to be a little gullible and to suspend a great deal of reality in the process. Some of the subject matter is too far fetched to ever expect it to be anywhere near believable if something like this were to ever happen in real life. None the less there are some genuinly freightening moments through out that work well even if they may seem to feel rather familiar. I also noticed there was a good job with the sound on this film. The work the sound crew did on this is worth taking notice of. I rarely take note of sound achievements in film unless its one of the obvious classics that won an oscar and is remembered for its over all sound quality. This one had me examining the sound a little closer and I couldnt help noticing the work done here where the sound is concerned was above average and worth recognizing. The film is not really awesome, but far from terrible. Its sort of a blend of The hills have eyes and a decent zombie movie, never getting as good as either, but still fairly entertaining. I saw Quarantine last night and felt it was superior on all levels though. it is a film with a similar story to tell, but its much more terrifying and ceetainly between the two the hands-down better choice if you happen to be wanting to decide between one or the other.

$REVIEW.: I had no idea what this film was about. I was absolutely stunned by the acting, the storyline, the direction, the background music and even Dustin Hoffman's little cameo. This film is about 150 minutes and yet is worth every bit of it. I would compare this film with greats like Prestige, Passion of the Christ, Amadeus and maybe even American Beauty. I compare it with Amadeus because of the setting, the extraordinary sets, with Prestige because of how effective and tactful the film-making is - unpredictable. Why I compare it with Passion of the Christ and maybe even Apocalypto because of the crime & punishment factor. It is American Beautyish because the central character goes through certain varied self-absorbed emotions to get what he wants. And then the character sees nothing but he wants and what he must do both in and out of order.I do not know why people didn't like the film. I'm happy some didn't get it. I am now looking forward to reading the book. I will not bother recommending this film to people who I think won't like it, simply because this is a film only to be appreciated by someone worthy of understanding it's craft and poignance. I loved the first one hour, hardly any dialogues, the film was amazingly easy to follow. The last thirty minutes had me so gripped that I felt a bit emotional out of the sheery beauty the central character brings out.The Perfume is a film about survival, faith and hobby. Three cheers and much respect for the makers.

$REVIEW.: A promise in the dance likes to gamble. He has trouble for saving money to marry, and when he goes to NYC to get some chance he will find the love of his life.As you may expect, the script is -in this sort of movies- less important than the visual content. After the sonorous triumph of "Top hat" this lovable couple returned to make us witness of a sympathetic romantic comedy in which we will delight before the fabulous musical numbers. Choreography, custom design and the presence of one of my eternal brides of the cinema Ginger Rogers will engage you from the very beginning.Jerome Kern's music is the perfect device to carve in relief his gifts. "The way you look tonight" is (at least to my mind) together  with "Misty", "My funny Valentine" ,"Laura", The very thought of you"  and "When I fall in love" an emblematic theme for the collective memory.  The agile direction of George Stevens ("Shane", "A place in the sun" and "Giant")Astaire once more demonstrates his out of this world qualities for this art. The dance with the three shadows on the screen is still a reminded cult sequence.

$REVIEW.: I wrote a 1 star review of Young Guns, that was a borderline painful experience.  The second though was actually not bad.  It was far more entertaining, plus I think the Jon Bon Jovi song "Blaze of Glory" (which to this day remains the one and only Bon Jovi song I like - group or solo project as this was) added some more spice to it.This for me began my interest in biography and historical figures, as I had heard the story about that man who claimed to be Billy The Kid.  Was he or wasn't he a fake?  Turns out he was from what I gather, but it will always linger.It's lite entertainment, but it's better than the first.  The second / third generation Brat Packers go for another attempt at keeping their resumes fresh.  Truth be told, although it's far from the greatest movie ever made, I thought this was Emilio Estevez's best work.  He was actually pretty funny as a silly, slick Billy The Kid, comic roles really suit him.  And Keifer Sutherland wasn't half bad either.  THey had a funny moment or two, I liked when he shot the chain to show off how slick he was.Criticism?  If you're looking for historical accuracy, it ain't here.  It was disappointing to find out that he lied to the brotherhood to get them to bond together and go on some wild goose chase to Mexico and there really wasn't a secret or underground passage.  I was hoping it was true and they were going to live happily ever after, or something, but, then again they were outlaws so how could they?  Have fun with it.

$review_text.: The Maze is a strange one. The first hour is a generic killer chases and kills attractive young people kind of film. But the last thirty minutes or so is like a crime drama with police questioning a would-be victim about the events that took place that night. So it get points for doing something different, and sort of changing genres in the third act. However, the film as a whole is just average. The killer isn't exactly menacing. He is skinny and pale and wears a hood, instead of a creepy mask. The Maze is only worth watching if you've seen the majority of the slasher movies out there, and want to see something new.

I also really enjoyed Justin Kirk's performance. He brought some much needed humor to this movie that deals with some heavy subject matter.

$review_text.: I do admit this movie is decently satisfying to watch because it is somewhat entertaining. However, the acting, script, and plot in this movie is very weak. Queen Latifah has her usual role as someone with moral values and stand for what's right, and does not back down. A wholesome woman if you may say.However, her lines in the movie were very mediocre and her character is not strong enough to support the kind of action the movie is trying to portray or at least SHOULD portray. Let's all admit straightforward, no lies; Queen Latifah is no way in heck a good actor. She's just mediocre. She does just enough acting to get the movie by without everybody booing her off the stage, she's a like-able person and that's the only thing she got going for her. Her acting is just to the bare minimum.In terms of script, I thought it was horrible. The movie was very fairytale-ish (which isn't bad I guess but makes it sorta lame) and extremely predictable. After the doctor diagnosed her problem, I predicted all of her actions all the way towards the ending. The plot was static and easily predictable because it is so. She did exactly as I thought she would in terms of (I'm trying not to release any spoilers).1. Job2. Her savings3. Her attitude changes (before she kept to herself)4. Her choice in using her savings.5. The doctor's diagnostics6. Ending.However, her role was not fully satisfied with the way she acted. For example when she confronted her lousy boss before quitting. The acting was there, but the scene was weak and her lines were weak so you never really felt satisfied with the outcome of her resolutions. Much stronger lines and more powerful dramatic scenes can make this movie much more intensifying and satisfying for the viewer.Am I disappointed? Nah...it's Queen Latifah, I was expecting something like this. It's not a bad movie, just wish they would have pushed it a bit more. The potential was never met, which is extremely rare in the movie industry *sarcasm duh...*If you want a movie that has somewhat of an entertainment value, especially for the family, this is good. Just don't expect a grammy performance.

$REVIEW.: Pairing Hunter S


Thompson and Terry Gilliam is an idea that should have spawned a subversive, critical and insightful film that looked at the American Dream and how in making it real it has become something  alltogether different.Unfortunately Gilliam shows a dedication to the  source material that verges on reverence, which is understandable but also  counter-productive


 We are hand held through a picture gallery of  Thompson's world but never does Gilliam let loose and let use the material  he is given for all its worth.Contrary to general opinion there IS a  point to the film, unfortunately it is really only made in the last few  minutes in an exposition speech by Hunter, and the narrative work before it  is only partially relevant.It's a good film but for this kind of  reverence it should have been given to Merchant Ivory, I can't help but  wish that Terry Gilliam had been in the kind of SUBVERSIVE mode that used  to be his norm, his work is much more insightful and brutal when he is,  which i feel this film needed, as opposed to his recent meloncholly from  Fisher Kind and 12 Monkeys, both which I loved.

$REVIEW.: In "The Captain's Paradise" Alec Guinness plays two roles simultaneously, and everything in between.  He is the captain of the ferry that crosses the Strait from Gibraltar (VERY English) to Morocco (VERY un-English) after WWII, and he has an appropriate wife on each side: in Gibraltar the practical and homeloving cook and seamstress (Celia Johnson), and in Africa the luscious lover (Yvonne DeCarlo). He himself changes character to suit as he goes back and forth, and gradually fades from one into the other with each trip. He has solved the problem of masculine living by splitting one woman into two and having one of each.The "Captain's Paradise", of course, is a fool's paradise.Charm and amusement, brilliantly acted by all.

Unlike many other black / white relationship movies (where the black character moves into a white environment, and we get the white environment's objections to the relationship), this movie shows us the black environment's point of view. Sarah has to adjust to a mostly black environment, for instance. We also get to hear why many black girls won't like seeing one of their 'best guys' dating a white girl. We do get to experience this movie from a completely unexpected point of view!The movie itself (while still containing many cliches) has a very important social message besides being fun to watch.

$REVIEW.: The plot of "Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines" is no different from that of T2:  two cyborgs, one programmed to kill eventual savior John Connor and the other to protect him, are zapped through time


 This conflict, a classic chase scene set-up, comprises the entire movie

 Without the questions of ethics and the unpredictability of the future uses of technology explored in T2, T3 is all action and no substance
 This will delight many fans and disappoint others.Nick Stahl as John Connor is an unlikely hero: nihilistic, hollow-eyed, and physically unimposing

 Claire Danes is exceptional in her role as the reluctant but fierce Kate who maintains her class even as she watches Schwarzenegger spit out a bullet


 Schwarzenegger plays his cyborg as he always has, with the same deadpan delivery whether he is expressing a horrific truth or poking fun at the previous films in the series
 I know a lot of people object to Kristianna Loken as the new T-X model, but I loved her
 She exhibits both the cold ambition of a machine and the tastes of a predator.The action sequences are all high-gear, breathtaking excitement even if the logic of them isn't always clear


 The screenwriters have provided some hilarious moments to punctuate the tension, many of which refer to jokes established in T1 and T2
 The ending is both surprising and surprisingly original, the only solid plot in the movie.If you are a Terminator fan, you must see this film
 Chase scene devotees and those with a hunger for pure action will love it

 The two hours pass quickly when you're gripping the arms of your chair, but don't expect to take anything away from this movie


 If you want even a modicum of substance with your action, skip this
 Four stars for the action, two for the plot.

Starring Vanessa Williams as 'Ebony Scrooge' a diva _itch r+b singer, this version has a very amusing script, and a wonderfully sarcastic Kathie Griffin as the "Ghost of Christmas Past" along with 3 songs sung by Vanessa Williams.

$REVIEW.: Although this isn't a perfect movie by far!If you enjoy the british invasion music from the 60's and into a little nostalgia,it was really fun to watch.I particularily enjoyed their song"I'm Leaning on a Lamp post" done on a space capsule!The only other movie Herman's Hermits starred in was the 1968 film,"Mrs. Brown you've got a lovely daughter' which I think had more character considering that it was filmed in Manchester where they were from plus it also starred the reknowned Stanley Holloway.I also wish that another 60's british invasion movie"Ferry cross the the Mersey" starring Gerry and the Pacemakers would be released.That would be great!!
$review_summary.: Just enjoyable fun to watch!!

$review_text.: &quot;Ice Age&quot; seems to get lots of comparison to movies like &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; in many reviews, but it's not a Mike Myers flick nor a Disney movie.  It might be computer animated like them but that is where similarities end.  &quot;Ice Age&quot; is more family friendly than &quot;Shrek&quot; and has moments just as, if not more, funny than &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;  The animation is visually stunning, especially in the opening when the iceberg begins &quot;chasing&quot; the &quot;Scrat.&quot;The cast is standout.  Ray Romano is cast as &quot;Manfred.&quot;  Like another reviewer I was a little skeptical of his playing the role of a mammoth, but he pulls it off brilliantly.  John Leguizamo played &quot;Sid,&quot; and proves once again that he can play just about any character.  He is non-stop comedy animated through this entire flick.  Denis Leary is fine as &quot;Diego,&quot; who undergoes changes through the whole movie.  There is a very touching scene with him near the end of this movie that almost made me tear up.This movie isn't too violent.  There was no bloodshed viewed onscreen, and the animation actually softens up the battle between the humans and the sabre-toothed tigers.  It's funny how such a rigid animation style makes battle sequences look less violent than they are.  There are plenty of funny moments for the little ones, especially with &quot;Scrat.&quot;  The writing is intelligent, fun and none too boring for adults.  Overall, this is a fun family movie.Cast your ideas of what an animated feature should be out the door and watch this movie for its great storyline, brilliant animation and touching characters.  It's a good addition to your DVD collection.

$REVIEW.: I will always remember those tense three days in April 1970 when the Apollo 13 astronauts seemed suspended in space, and this was well before the days of 24-hour coverage by CNN and Fox


For those who have yet to purchase this movie on DVD, the tenth anniversary two-disc set is a must-have for any adventure film-lover, especially for those like myself who were obsessed with the nation's space program in the 1960's and early 70's


Ron Howard, the director, came of age with this thrilling recreation of the aborted Apollo 13 mission, as defining a moment in NASA's history as the tragic Challenger explosion
The 1995 movie was a faithful depiction of what went wrong with the flight and how the mission changed dramatically to one of saving the three astronauts from being marooned in space forever


One would think that knowing the ending would rob the viewer of the suspense factor, but Howard does an amazing job in making the story feel fresh by guiding us through the heroic acts both in the capsule and at NASA's Mission Control in vividly realistic detail
He also evokes the atmosphere back then with emotional and visual accuracy, showing how anti-climactic the mission was perceived in light of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon just the year prior

A rupture in the oxygen tank changed things completely as the movie illustrates a desperate attempt at survival with computer systems turned off, the capsule moving toward freezing temperatures and the three men relying on their gut instincts to maneuver the capsule home.What I appreciate most about the movie is that Howard does not derail the basic story with unnecessary subplots or flourishes of melodrama
He realizes the real story is more than enough to engage the viewer and that the attention to detail, often technical in nature, is not off-putting


 Howard even creates blood-pumping suspense out of the ground effort to jerry-build a scrubber to clean carbon dioxide from the capsule's air supply


 This kind of film is all in the details, even the more predictable home scenes where family members try to confront their increasing sense of fear

The movie has a solid testosterone-heavy cast - Tom Hanks stalwart as always as Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell; Bill Paxton as Fred Haise; Kevin Bacon as last-minute substitute Jack Swigert; Ed Harris as determined flight director Gene Kranz; Gary Sinise as grounded astronaut Ken Mattingly; and bravely leading the homefront is Kathleen Quinlan as Lovell's wife, Marilyn

Even though the move is full of familiar suspense elements and the characters' interactions are often just officious, there is hardly a wasted dramatic moment in the entire film, pretty impressive given its 140-minute running time
This is a superbly done real-life adventure film and docudrama and aside from Philip Kaufman's 1983 adaptation of Tom Wolfe's "The Right Stuff", probably the best movie about the space program.The smoothly edited, 116-minute IMAX version (produced in 2002) is on the second disc, and the widescreen orientation coupled with the enhanced sound makes for great viewing as well


There are three documentaries included spread across both discs: the comprehensive making-of feature, "Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13 - The Making of Apollo 13", which has interviews with Howard and the cast, as well as insight into how the space shots were created; "Conquering Space: The Moon and Beyond", a 48-minute general overview of the race to the Moon and the exploration of Mars, produced mainly for the uninitiated; and a twelve-minute NBC Dateline feature called "Lucky 13: The Astronauts' Story", which contains interviews with the astronauts and members of Mission Control for the Apollo 13 mission


There are two alternative commentary tracks, the first with Howard who is extremely knowledgeable and highly infectious in his descriptions of the shoot, the other with Jim and Marilyn Lovell providing valuable insight as to how it really felt as the events were unfolding
A truly excellent package.

We are slowly drawn into the story along with the main character John Cusack..who always plays (it seems)the easy going.. likeable get along guy who is non threatening...blah in a way.There is very little gore in this film.Is something/someone  messing with his mind?

$review_text.: Night Wolf/ 13 Hrs is a 2010 British horror flick starring Isabella Calthorpe, Gemma Atkinson and Tom Felton, better known as Draco Malfoy from the Harry Potter movies.The film is very well done for what it is; a low-budget British horror. There's a storyline which has actually had a bit of thought put into it, the special effects aren't the worst, the acting is acceptable and the relationships between the characters is well established from early in the movie.However, I found it difficult to sympathise with many or indeed any of the characters in this film for the simple reason that they are on the whole, over-privileged, arrogant and generally unlikeable with very little in the way of redeeming qualities. In fact, it was a delight to watch many of them meet their end. Moreover, I struggled to look at Tom Felton and think of him as anything other than Draco Malfoy. Of all the actors, I was most surprised by the performance of Gemma Atkinson who was able to demonstrate a greater range than that of mere eye candy and monster fodder.The feel of the film is that the group was genuinely trapped within the house and as is necessary with any horror film made in the 21st century, there's an explanation for the absence of mobile phones from anyone's person that allows the movie to progress nicely towards a fairly predictable horror flick ending.The film was comfortable within its 85 minute running time but feel that some gore, death scenes and shots of the beast are gracing the cutting room floor for the sake of getting this particular flick a "15" certification and therefore a potentially wider audience. Boooooooo!I've certainly seen worse horror movies and definitely shoddier domestic productions. All in all, I would suggest that this one is fairly middle of the road but could certainly have benefited from a bit more "horror" in this horror movie.

$review_text.: This film is considered the apex of Universal's classic horror films. It is memorable for Boris Karloff's role-defining portrayal of Frankenstein's nameless creature, James Whale's unique direction, and the trademark "look" of the high-coiffured bride. In addition, there is the presence of Dr. Praetorius, the epitome of prissy evil. He is obviously one of the "have not" types that live in a garret and plot vengeance on the world that he feels slighted him. Sexually he is ambiguous. Praetorius looks with nose crinkling disapproval on Henry Frankenstein's marriage relationship with Elizabeth. Praetorius anxiously keeps his "king in a bottle" away from the little queen. Yet, he is the one who comes to Frankenstein by night and argues the case they should collaborate to create a mate for the monster. Perhaps this is his revenge on an unsuspecting world of heterosexual couples. Dr. Praetorius utters the classic line "of gods and monsters" as he and Frankenstein ponder their !unholy alliance. This gives the viewer some insight into his visions of power.James Whale directs a unique film that blends a horror movie with a subtext of dark humor and thought provoking nuances. Religious symbolism, used in peculiar ways, adds to the bizarre humor. Karloff's creature, especially after he learns speech, is both menacing and vulnerable. The scene with his "bride" is comically grotesque, and leads to explosive disaster. The enigmatic bride is one of the most unusual looking creatures in all of Universal's horror classics. Her one-time appearance is all too brief. The mad doctors' lab flashes and crackles with electricity from the dread machines that Dr. Frankenstein uses to harness the lightning that rages around the castle's ramparts. For collectors of classic horror films, or for anyone who would enjoy a twist to the familiar "boy meets girl" plot, this movie is for you. Remember, beware those who do not reckon upon God! Recommended for multiple vie!wing. ;-)

$review_text.: ...the television version of the &quot;Living Legend&quot; was much better
 I admit to buying this video strictly for that aspect of this haphazardly spliced-together film


 (&quot;Fire In Space&quot; episode by itself is okay too)

Okay, to the plot (for the non-BSG familiar)

 Lorne  Greene leads an aircraft-carrier sized spacecraft (the Battlestar  Galactica), with 200-some odd civilian craft in tow, in search of the  mythical planet Earth after their colonies were destroyed by a relentless  cybernetic race called the Cylons
 During a recon mission, two of his  patrol craft accidentally run into a patrol from another battlestar whose  legendary commander (Lloyd Bridges) they thought perished years ago


The  two commanders reunite, but quickly realize they have differences on how to  proceed


 Commander Adama (Greene) wants only fuel to get his fleet  underway while Commander Cain (Bridges) wants to put the smackdown on the  Cylons by any means necessary

 Interesting plot and outstanding special  effects (although some are blatantly rehashed AND stolen from the movie  &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;

 Good supporting cast too, including  Richard Hatch (Capt
Apollo), Dirk Benedict (Lt

Starbuck), Terry Carter  (Col

Tigh), Anne Lockhart (Lt

Sheba) and the late (but enjoyably oily)  John Colicos as the traitor Baltar
 Bottom line -- good escapist  entertainment


 I've loved the BSG series since I was a kid and the  &quot;Living Legend&quot; was the best of the lot
 I've heard rumors of  resurrecting the series as a movie, miniseries and even an IMAX movie

 (Whatever it takes, folks, just do it!)

$review_text.: I am a sucker for fairy tales, and I tend to like Burton films, so I am not surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  Instead of renting it, I decided to purchase, trusting it would have artwork I'd want to watch again, and that maybe one day when my kids are older, they'll enjoy watching it.  No regrets in this buy.  It was very fun.  I was nervous when reading the negative reviews here that I'd hate the music, but I liked the musical numbers.  And I really liked the story.  The stop-action animation is amazing enough to watch this movie, but there is so much more to enjoy.As far as kids, this film has quite a different feel than, say, a Disney's Aladdin, but there are no scenes quite as scary and suspenseful as Aladdin contains.  It instead has creepy little characters that happen to be quite friendly.  (SPOILER!  I adore the scene when the dead came up among the living-- old couples reunited, a child hugging a long-missed grandpa, dogs sniffing each other).  True, I won't show this movie to my kids until they are AT LEAST 6 or 7... but honestly, that's how I feel about nearly every film marketed to children out there.  The only villian in this film was a living man, and he wasn't scary.  It's the manipulative Scar from Lion King or frightening villian in Anastasia (both great films) that happen to seem more scary to me.  Oh, and nobody is left an orphan early on in this film either.  Just a bunch of silly skeletons and the like having a great old time in the afterlife.  Odd?  Yes.  Fun?  YES.

$REVIEW.: It's been a long time since I've seen a movie with such wit, beautifully acted.  What might have been a one-joke premise carefully plays out sidesplitting variations on its theme.  Betrayed by a self-absorbed prima-donna, Pacino resorts to creating a virtual actress via computer.  Since no one can meet her, this only fuels a Garbo-esque cult popularity.  This fabricated actress is more real to her audience than any flesh and blood woman.  When Pacino becomes jealous of the non-existant actress he created, he tries to kill off his creation.  Now the complications really compound!

$REVIEW.: Noel Coward wrote EASY VIRTUE, his 16th play, at age 25. It ran on Broadway for 147 performances between Dec. 1925 and April '26, then went in London. As originally presented, this was a three act melodrama with a few witty dashes.Alfred Hitchcock kept the original outline but darkened the story. He eliminated all but two lines of the play script. The movie opens with Larita's divorce trial, a suit brought by her brutish husband after Larita's lover commits suicide. The jury finds for the plaintiff. She leaves for the south of France and meets the man who will be her second husband.Larita's in-laws resent her from the beginning. They treat her like a dog privately but put on phony happy faces for their friends. The mother-in-law is particularly caustic and she turns her son against his wife. When news clippings of the  sensational trial surface, he scorns Larita and the story ends with a divorce notice after she leaves the family's country estate.Long believed lost, a copy of "Easy Virtue" turned up in the 1970s. It's interesting primarily in reference to Hitchcock's body of work, especially his pre-Hollywood films. Although evidence of the director's future style is everywhere, acting in this silent film is hammy, especially from leading lady Miss Jeans. Two versions exist: this 79 minute one and an 89 minute restoration. (Director cameo: Hitch ambles past the tennis court with a walking stick.)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(5.8) Easy Virtue (UK-1927) - Isabel Jeans/Franklin Dyall/Eric Bransby Williams/Ian Hunter/Robin Irvine/Violet Farebrother/Frank Elliott/Darcia Deane/Dorothy Doyd/Enid Stamp-Taylor

$review_text.: Shortly into this movie, I realized that the sensei may have been a real person in history, but Kurosawa selected his life to represent his own. Metaphorically, Kurosawa was the great sensei of the global film industry. This film released just a few years before his death carried a message to all his beloved fans and students, &quot;Madadayo (Not yet).&quot; Kurosawa died when I was in Tokyo working at the Pacific Stars and Stripes. The week of his death, I had asked my editor to try to arrange an interview with the great film master. Sadly, before I could met him, he passed on. So, it was that when I realized the message of this, his final film, was the he was not ready to pass on, I cried. Subtle, sublime, personal, this film is not designed for average viewers. For devoted Kurosawa fans, it will be a touching farewell. For those with a less intimate relationship with the film master, it may seem slow and unmoving.  I, however, was very moved. Kurosawa's passing is truly a loss to the world of media imagery.

 Its is stylish, vastly witty, and takes what it would be like to be a &#34;different&#34; being seriously
 Think of Candid when you think of Suk because this season pulls that off


 In DVD version, there is no censorship of the nudity and frank language which is also so much fun

 Paquin is perfect with her wholesome perkiness, realistic sensuality, and &#34;girl next door with a secret&#34; that even she does not yet understand.One could say that the overall theme is self-discovery, highlighted with the repeated phrase, &#34;What are you?&#34; (not the &#34;who are you?&#34; or &#34;What do you do?&#34; of common conversations today)
 By her answer, &#34;a waitress,&#34; she exposes society's concentration on what you do as a mistaken definition of  &#34;what we are.&#34;  But, do not be put off by that lofty analysis;  instead, just immerse yourself in the fun characters and story lines (so many)


 Stop thinking this is a vampire show;  it is much more.Sadly, the wit and energy of the first Season was not carried on to the later ones
 Of course, if you want the full joys of this series, you must start with the first Season

 In two days, I watched all five, one after the other in order, and cant wait to see what later installments are going to do


 It is tuff to top the First, however.

I also own its progenitor but prefer this version (which is also perhaps one of the few instances I could cite in which a cinematic remake improves on its model). For the first time, it is available in a letterboxed edition and, of course, with improved blu ray video and audio. The packaging also provides more insight into the film's making.  The ending in which Roy Scheider meets his existential fate simply cannot be improved upon.

$review_text.: As a Chevy Chase comedy, Man of The House is far from his funniest; however, it works well as a family drama.The story's sort of an inverted "Courtship of Eddie's Father."  In this case it's the boy's mother (Farrah Fawcett) who is single, and the boy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas of Home Improvement, Tom and Huck, etc.) is wary of her new fiancee, a prosecutor named Sturges  (Chase).  Still feeling burnt by his ex-dad, the boy tries everything to get rid of the prospective one.  Some of this is funny, like when he paints Sturges's face with Indian war paint that won't come off, and the parts that aren't funny are still interesting and help develop the characters and story.  I think the film is most effective in that it demonstrates the persistence of faith necessary to build a family, as Sturges doesn't give up on the boy, but continues to try to win his friendship after each prank by the boy, and each failure of his own.  Competent acting by Thomas helps the film succeed on this score.The subplot is about a hoodlum Sturges sent to prison, and his son and his thugs trying to get revenge on the prosecutor.  Mostly this is supposed to be funny, but doesn't live up to Chase's usual standards.  However, it does weave a bit of suspense into the story and provides a catalyst for Sturges to finally win over the boy's sympathies, as well as a climax with some action.The supporting cast includes George Wendt (Cheers), who's mostly serious in this role, and Art LeFleur, who's funny as an Indian Guides martinet.If you're looking for a hilarious comedy, don't look here; but if you're in the mood for a light family drama with a well-devoloped message and some humor, Man of the House will foot the bill with one family values caveat:  Chase and Fawcett move in together before they're married.
$SUMMARY.: Decent family drama, not hilarious comedy.

$review_text.: Joe Harmon (played by Bryan Brown) rocks! And so does this whole movie, based on Nevil Shute's superb novel of the same name. It starts well, picks up speed, and gets better and better. During WWII, Jean (who is her family's only survivor) is force marched back and forth across Malaysia by the Japanese, who don't know what to do with a bunch of English women and children. As their group dwindles from starvation, fatigue, malaria and dystntery, Jean becomes the leader of the little group, and she negotiates a deal with the headman of a small village whose men have been taken off to fight in the war: if the village will shelter them, the surviving English will work in the rice fields.But it was during the months of wandering that Jean met Joe Harmon, an Austrailian prisoner of war who steals food for her, is crucified and left for dead by the Japanese.After the war, when Jean is back in England, she comes into her family's money, and she has a dream: to return to Malaya to build a well for the village women. To her amazement, she learns that Harmon actually survived: when the Japanese could not grant him his last wish, they were honor bound to save his life. Jean goes back to find him at the same time he, having just discovered that she wasn't married when he met her (a deception she fostered for her own protection), flies to England to look for her. The two planes cross.But, as with most good love stories, they meet - and things are awkward and stilted. When he knew her, her hair was loose and tangled, she was barefoot and wearing a sarong, and she had an orphan child balanced on her hip. Now when he sees her, she's an English lady - and he's still just a bloke from the outback.Oh, I'm telling too much. Suffice to say that Jean's attempt to resume their former easy and relaxed relationship while in Australia's Great Barrier Reef is spectacularly successful, and she's faced with spending the rest of her life in the desolate and lonely outback. Alice Springs, the nearest thing to `civilization,' is too far to go, so Jean determines to spend her small fortune turning her little nowhere town into a place from which the young people will no longer flee in frustration. In short, she creates the world in which she wants to live and raise Joe's and her children.It's so, so, so, so good, one of those videos you'll have to buy. Trust me on that.

$review_text.: Ridley Scott's "Legend," like "Dragonslayer" before it and "Labyrinth" that succeeded it, had the misfortune of being released at a time when films of fantasy took a back seat to the outer space battles of the respective "Star Wars" and "Star Trek" film.  Had the aforementioned films been released during today's friendlier fantasy times, after the box office successes of "The Lord of the Rings Trilogy" and the Harry Potter films, they probably would've fared better at the box office.Though not a great film, "Legend" does have a couple of good things going for it.First off, it offers a look at a truly innocent Tom Cruise, not the superstar or scientology advocate or psycho-blabbler that we've come to love, but a genuine star on the rise.  He looks as fresh and wide-eyed as...say Katie Holmes...just right for the role of an forest-dwelling innocent that must restore the world order after his beloved princess (Mia Sara) makes an error in judgment.Secondly, the film has a unique look, so characteristic of Scott's film.  Listening to the director's commentary is a fascinating experience as he tells how he achieved that look under tight budgetary constraints and a studio mishap.Thirdly, the restored Jerry Goldsmith score is a auditory treat.  The "Dress Waltz" is one of Goldsmith's most riveting pieces and the entire score ranks as one of his best of his later compositions. It is baffling as to why the "suits" decided to discard the composer's work in exchange for the avant garde yet boring Tangerine Dream score.And finally, Tim Curry is brilliant as the "Lord of Darkness". Although hidden under layers of make-up (to give him his menacing and muscular appearance), the actor's vivid portrayal illuminates every scene in which he appears.  It's a shame that the film's short running time didn't allow for more screen time for the gifted actor.
$review_summary.: Suffered from being released during the wrong era!

$review_text.: I do not know about you, but I can not stand watching most of the current cartoons or shows that my daughters enjoy. There is usually a very superficial story that teaches some in your face lesson, and very little imagination. My oldest daughter turned three this past winter and for one of our movie nights I picked up Season One of DuckTales. She loves it, and so do I. I was a child in the 90's and remember all of these episodes (ok, so I might have been raised by a TV in my bedroom).The great thing about this show and collection is how imaginative it is, and there is always a good moral lesson (although it doesn't smack you in the face like a big piece of salami). We have since picked up Chip n' Dale's Rescue Rangers and plan to start collecting these shows (TaleSpin, Goof Troop, Gummi Bears, and if I am very persuasive Darkwing Duck). I highly recommend giving them a chance, your children will love it. These cartoons are timeless.

$REVIEW.: Scott Turow is one of my favorite authors. I've read several of his books, but mostly some while ago. I recently reviewed his non-fiction book about the death penalty, "Ultimate Punishment."The only really recognizable face in this movie is Tom Sellack, who plays detective Larry Starczek. One that kept haunting me is a fairly minor character named Collins Farwell is played by Shemar Moore. I knew I'd seen him somewhere before, and pretty sure he played a cop, but it was not until I looked this movie up on IMDB that I realized he was Detective Derek Morgan in the TV series, "Criminal Minds."What we know at the outset of this film is that three people were murdered in a diner, a woman and two men. A rather flimsy trail of evidence leads Starczek to a fence named Squirrel Gandalf (Glenn Plummer), and when Starczek confronts him, he admits he doesn't know whether he did it or not. He was just that stoned. Starczek convinces him that he did, and he confesses.Remember, this is just the beginning, not the end. He is sentenced to death, but when the appeals procedure gets down to the wire after seven years, the court appoints a successful corporate attorney named Arthur Raven (William H. Macy) to represent him. As Mr. Raven digs into the facts of the case, it becomes clear that there were a lot of problems with Squirrel's conviction.There are a couple of love stories complicating the issue here, one that was supposedly over long ago, and one that took both of the participants by surprise. I will say no more, except that the love stories are so well woven into the criminal investigation and court case that they are indeed relevant to the story, and indeed relevant to the outcome of the appeal.And I'm not going to tell you that, either.

This is  a very fine film. Well paced and kept me engaged thru out. Thats not easy to do in my case. The dialog, acting, and production value along with the soundtrack is better than 90% of the stuff I've seen in the past ten years.  I don't really understand todays movie goers. They don't seem attracted to good clean stuff anymore. More films like this should be made, but probably won't be. They prefer I suppose stuff like Hunger Games. Terrible movie. Another film I can recommend is Dean Spanley  if you can find a copy.

$REVIEW.: The brainchild of writer Joss Whedon, Buffy The Vampire Slayer originally entered American pop culture as a full-length feature film, starring Kristy Swanson, in 1992. But creator Whedon felt that the project never quite did justice to the full scope of his vision, so he managed turn the film into a television series in 1997. The result of Whedon's increased artistic freedom is a series that has enjoyed both critical acclaim and audience notoriety. Nominated for 14 Emmy's during its seven year run, the show managed to win only two (both in 1998 for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Music Composition in a television series). Yet, the true success for Buffy The Vampire Slayer is indicated by the massive success of the show's long run, strong DVD sales, and the overwhelming success of the series spin-off Angel...Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the title role of Buffy Anne Summers, a teenage girl who stands alone among her generation as the "chosen one" able to "stand against vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer..." But Buffy is not alone in fulfilling her destiny as a slayer of vampires. She also receives help from the high school librarian, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who is a Watcher - the one chosen to train and guide slayers on their developmental path. In addition, new friends Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan - of American Pie fame) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) quickly uncover the truth of Buffy's destiny, and they often aid her in defending the world against evil forces...The Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 4) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere "The Freshman" in which Buffy moves into her college campus dorm where she's immediately apprehensive about her less-than-comfortable situation (not being accompanied by the Scooby gang). As Giles, Willow, and Xander each go their own way, Buffy realizes that she must confront the evil forces on her own (especially considering there's a band of vampires on her college campus)... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include "The Harsh Light of Day" in which Spike returns to Sunnydale in search of the mysterious Gem of Amara (which makes vampires invincible), and "Something Blue" in which Willow inadvertently casts a spell which wrecks havoc on all of her friends...Below is a list of episodes included on the Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 4) DVD:Episode 57 (The Freshman)Episode 58 (Living Conditions)Episode 59 (The Harsh Light of Day)Episode 60 (Fear, Itself)Episode 61 (Beer Bad)Episode 62 (Wild at Heart)Episode 63 (The Initiative)Episode 64 (Pangs)Episode 65 (Something Blue)Episode 66 (Hush)Episode 67 (Doomed)Episode 68 (A New Man)Episode 69 (The I in Team)Episode 70 (Goodbye Iowa)Episode 71 (This Year's Girl)Episode 72 (Who Are You?)Episode 73 (Superstar)Episode 74 (Where the Wild Things Are)Episode 75 (New Moon Rising)Episode 76 (The Yoko Factor)Episode 77 (Primeval)Episode 78 (Restless)The DVD Report

However years later, one of the high schoolers named Carol (Caroline Munroe of "Maniac" fame) and other friends have been invited to a high school reunion at their old school which apparently has been abanoned for years in which they enter as unknown to them there's a homicidal maniac with a joker mask is on the prowl to dismember them one by one.Exciting and cheesy 80's UK/US made slasher flick with a score by Henry Manfredini of "House" and "Friday The 13th" fame is one of those so bad it's good type slasher movies. The acting is kind of bad and the story is a bit inane but there's some grotesque kills and gore such as the memorable acid melting skin in the tub sequence guaranteed to make you chilled and the ending is bizarre.This DVD contains the extended unrated version with all the gore in it and the transfer is a bit weak including the sound with a few extras like trivia track and trailer.

If Kung Fu Panda (1 & 2) are examples, I may need to buy a lot more!Kung Fu Panda 2 was funny, acerbic, witty, sad, and completely enthralling! Watching a roly-poly panda take his kung-fu to another level is heart-warming - and scary!The voices for the various characters could not be more spot on. Jack Black has raised the bar for animation voices so high I'm not sure it will ever be beat!!! (I will add an aside here for Andy Serkis' performance as Gollum/Smeagol in LOTR however, although, technically, I don't consider that "animation" such as this. Gollum was on another level entirely!)One slight note of caution; 1 of my granddaughters is 2 1/2, and I think this may be just a little too much fighting for her. It should be fine for 4 or 4 1/2 +, though.

Was THRILLED when I heard the DVD was to be released, this is a cheesy and corny horror movie about kids who party on Halloween night at a closed/abandoned mortuary that has demons haunting it (who, of course, have only Halloween as their night to howl) that I have watched over and over on VHS already ...The extras are nothing to brag about, though the 14-minute interview with Linnea Quigley is cool.  But it's nice to have the movie back, on DVD, and whatever you do don't buy the sequel but stick with the real deal -- Angela (that's her in all her loveliness gracing the cover) throws one hell of a party!

$REVIEW.: Sidney Reilly really was an international man of mystery and no-one really knew him including his wives and fellow spies.  Sam Neil was incredible as Reilly. He showed a man who was elegant, charming and yet so ruthless you could almost see the ice in his veins. He doesn't have a problem with killing and he doesn't have a problem with leaving an incompetent agent behind either. He was a womanizer who could be the ultimate romantic in one scene then simply walk away in the next. One of the most touching scenes in the series is when Reilly's wives and sweethearts all clamor for news of him. He's treated some of these women horribly. One he's turned into a hopeless drunk but they still can't get enough of him. In another scene, one of his conquests calmly faces death rather than betray him. After her death Reilly, the series implies, carries her earrings, the only thing he has left of her on him for the rest of his life.Reilly has been called the grandfather of the Jame Bond character because by the time young Ian Flemming came along Reilly was a legend in the British spy world. Flemming denied this but Reilly's relationship with his spymaster is very reminiscent of Bond and M and of course there all those women.Everything about this series is great. The acting is all top notch, the costumes are perfect, the music, especially Romance of the Gadfly, Reilly's theme is unforgettable. This series came on TV when I was a kid and I would rush home every week to get all my homework and any other chore done so I could watch Reilly in peace. It was worth the trouble then and it's worth it now.

Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll, and Vampire Hunter D are the Fab Four of the Anime Universe. You simply cannot go wrong by buying this film. Lots of futuristic action with a major Goth theme to it. You would swear that this was taking place in the dark ages during some parts of this film, but then you see the technology that they have in the future. . . WOW. That's all I can say. WOW. Do yourself a huge favor: See this movie! And with it coming out on DVD, how could it possibly get any better? By the way, even if you don't fully apreciate Japanese animation, this is still one of the greatest vampire action movies of all time. If you want to see an example of what great japanese anime is all about, then there are just a few films that you truly must see: AKIRA, Princess Mononoke, Ghost in the Shell, and Vampire Hunter D. This is truly a classic film. Enjoy.fin

$review_text.: In 2003, Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg alienates most of his classmates when he creates a website comparing the attractiveness of girls on campus. However, a trio of other students are impressed by his technical skills and hire him to create a social networking site. When they discover that Zuckerberg has created a rival site based on the same idea, 'The Facebook', they decide to sue him for intellectual theft. At the same time, as Zuckerberg's fame grows and the site becomes more and more popular, he risks alienating the friends who helped build him the site.The Social Network is a movie which has a substantial problem: the premise is a very hard sell. The story of Facebook's founding is pretty straightforward: geek hits on winning idea, becomes billionaire, cheeses off a lot of people along the way and gets sued. In order to make a compelling and entertaining movie, the producers decided to bring out the big guns: hire the writer of The West Wing to pen the script, get the director of Fight Club and Se7en to direct, employ the creative force behind Nine Inch Nails to produce the score and finally bring on board a number of the best, promising young American actors of their generation to play the roles. And it more or less works.David Fincher directs the film like a thriller, using intense close-ups and a steady pace, intercutting between the two court cases in the present and events unfolding on-campus in 2003-04 to give us a clear overview of the situation. He uses some great techniques to make otherwise dull scenes real energy, such as the use of rather bizarre camera techniques whilst the Winklevoss twins row in a boat race to the sound of a crazy cover of Flight of the Bumblebee. He is helped by Sorkin's clever script with its rapid-fire dialogue and cutting insults which may lack realism (were these young people really all that incredibly witty?) but is a lot of fun.Performances are excellent, particularly Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg, who delivers a controlled, twitchy performance with outbursts of (improbably good) acerbic humour. Armie Hammer plays both of the Winklevoss twins through a combination of CGI and split screen techniques which are flawlessly executed (not being familiar with Hammer's prior work, I genuinely thought they'd hired a pair of twins to play the roles), and his performance is excellent, reaching a height in a scene where the twins confront the president of Harvard and are told to their incredulity that they don't have a leg to stand on as they try to punish Zuckerberg for 'stealing' their idea. Andrew Garfield - the soon-to-be new Peter Parker - is also great as the most sympathetic character in the film, Zuckerberg's best friend Eduardo Severin who is screwed over for no real reason (though note that Severin is the only major player to cooperate with the writing of the book the movie is based on, which may account for this). Justin Timberlake fulfils his early acting potential by playing Sean Parker, the founder of Napster whom Zuckerberg turns to for advice despite Parker's irresponsible reputation, to Severin's disgust.So, we have a great script, some great actors and a great director. Does this add up to a great movie? Almost. The film is ticking along nicely and is saying some interesting (if somewhat over-familiar) things about fame, avarice and genius when coupled to a strong work ethic but a lack of morality, when it just stops. There's no real climax or a conclusion, the movie suddenly screeches to a halt on a rate trite note: Zuckerberg is told, completely contrary to everything we've seen, that he's not a bad person in an awkward scene that might as well have, "PLEASE DON'T SUE US," flashing at the bottom of the screen. This is one of the risks of making a film based on events that are so recent. The Facebook story is still ongoing, and the film simply catches up with the present day and then runs out of plot. No real conclusions are reached, or are indeed reachable, since we are also told that none of the major participants could take part in the movie due to various legal gagging orders and NDAs, meaning a fair amount of guesswork has to go into the story. There's also some rather interesting deviations from the facts for the sake of drama, such as the fact that Zuckerberg had a steady girlfriend for almost the entire timeframe of the events in the movie, but in the film he is presented as a bachelor who is motivated by a bad break-up.The Social Network (****) almost succeeds in being a modern dramatic version of Seinfeld: a movie about nothing that succeeds thanks to winning scripts, performances and direction. The tremendous creative forces involved make the film as tense and effective as it can be, but at the end of the day there is the feeling that this is a movie which is based on a thin premise. That they make it into such a compelling movie is a tribute to their skills, but the lack of a climax leaves the film feeling a little incomplete. The movie is available now on DVD (UK, USA) and Blu-Ray (UK, USA).

$review_text.: All good films, some new to DVD ("San Francisco", "Wife Vs. Secretary", etc.), from Warner's MGM library.  They all feature the usual great film transfers we've all come to expect from Warner Bros. However, "Wife Vs. Secretary" was transferred from a very poor print which was unfortunate because I found the film has an unusually good performance from Jean Harlow and has a great little story.  The release of "San Francisco" is timely because of the 100th anniversary of the 1906 earthquake and fire.  This has always been a favorite of mine. This collection is a good cross section of Gable's work and definitely deserves a first or second look!

$review_text.: This DVD is sorely lacking in special features
 All you get is the movie trailer, (which is unintentionally funny as the voice-over narrator intones "Adrienne Barbeau....an outrageous pair!"  Well, she does look great in a tight sweater!) a language selection, a scene index, and a leaflet with some background material.The movie, though, is great and in widescreen format

 Wes Craven departs from his usual gore to make a comic book hero into a comic book movie, with lots of action and derring-do

 There's even a poignant love story


 It's a fast moving romp in the swamp.Adrienne's nude bathing scene has been restored in this DVD version

 For some reason it was edited out of the U.S


theatrical release, although not the European version

 But now the complete movie is available, and I recommend this DVD to all Adrienne Barbeau fans, all Wes Craven fans, and all comic book fans.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed the Perry Mason series as a child; they were part of a family tradition which included visits to family friends so my parents could play cards together and so the children of both families could watch their favorite television programs.  When I saw the series offered on DVD, I decided to purchase some of them.  I'm so glad I did.  I actually get much more out of them now than I did at the time.It's amazing to see how much of US culture has changed over time; it's also impressive to see how much television has contributed to it.  While I, having lived through it, have felt that things "haven't changed much" technologically, in fact they really have!  Seeing the old television sets, the automobiles, the typewriters, etc. makes me realize how "primitive" we were back then.  More than that, even, is the very obvious lack of convenient devices that we enjoy now.  When Paul Drake had to stop by a phone booth to call Perry in two different episodes, I realized how instant our communications have become in recent times.Our society has changed a lot in other ways, too.  While it was nice seeing men open doors for women, etc. the attitude of "woman the helpless" gets pretty tiresome.  Seeing their overwhelming dependence on men, the legal and sociological obstacles that prevented its being any other way, made me realize how far our society has come in leveling the playing field between the genders.  Seeing the incredible burdens placed on men during those times makes me realize that equalizing that playing field in the interest of a more collaborative relationship was probably good for both men and women.  Seeing where the country had started with respect to ethnic and racial attitudes and to their liberalization through the medium of television was also interesting.  While Perry Mason was hardly in the front lines of social reform--black people are always in the background where they appear at all--the presentation of Asians in a positive light, especially so soon after World War II, suggests a trend was already starting in the very early 60s.Probably most importantly to the average person is the major change in our legal system.  While I enjoy Perry's overwhelming belief in and loyalty to his clients and his capacity to see through to the real culprit, I still cringe when he tampers with evidence and aids his clients in their evasion of the law.  I also cringe when I see the rather cavalier handling of evidence by the police; it makes one wonder how many people were convicted by virtue of such bungling!  I think that our more recent expectation that there be a clear "history" of the handling of evidence is a very positive and necessary one.The one tradition that appears to be solid from Perry's time to ours is the rule of law and its mediation by both clear standards and past practice.  While justice may be misdirected by adherence to these principles, it is only by maintaining them without fail for everyone, that anything like justice can be served.  If nothing else, the system makes at least an attempt, to the best of human abilities, to serve the interests of society and of the individuals within it.  Inequities occur, but here as in other human endeavors, it's the attempt that counts.  That's a good lesson.

$REVIEW.: I love ABBA. Meryl Streep is arguably the best, most versatileactress on sets today. She's also pretty pretty. (Sound like Buddy Holly, but it'strue). Cast, cinematography, DTS sound, and this film still could havetanked. But, alas! Mamma Mia! roars into your frontal lobe and then infests your soul. What a trip.A thin script it has an original premise, although I refuseto hint at what it's about, lest you might guess how it ends up. Trust me-as have millions of other-- erudite-types, Mensa monkeys and film buffs.you're in for 108 minutes of a living room get-away.It's all filmed inthe kind of tropical island everybody wants to see though few ever get closer than a big screen and Blu-ay player.Watching this film is a vicarious thrill and as close to being there. as need be. When  Ms. Streep singsthe title song and later, "Dancing Queen" you wonder if there's anythingshe can't do. Her character REALLY does with style and good taste.All of which could be said for the entire film.

$review_text.: Howdy. Seen Manos? If not then I have to find a way to describe it to you. The year is 1966. Hal Warren a fertilizer salesman from New Mexico (allegedly) makes a bet with a director visiting the area that he can make a horror film to rival those made by professionals all by himself. Thus, Manos was born. Armed with a home video camera that filmed, without sound, in 30-second intervals, Hal recruited the toughest, bravest, local theatre actors and models he could rustle up. Hal was so talented that he was able to write the screenplay, act the lead role, produce, and direct this film all by himself! By now your dying to know the plot so I won't tease you any longer. Middle aged Mike takes his fresh out of high school wife and their five year old daughter out for a lovely vacation in the wilderness of New Mexico. Somehow they get lost and stop for directions at a creepy old house where they are greeted by a deformed man, Torgo. When creepy deformed Torgo informs them that he can't help them because "The master is away" Mike does what any normal average man would do -- asks to spend the night. The rest of the plot is far too shocking to divulge. It's difficult to rate this movie even by B movie standards. Why 5 stars? Because I find the movie enjoyable. The worst movies made aren't bad because of low-budgets or talent, their bad because they're boring, predictable, hack-written, etc. When you watch Manos you're watching a one of a kind time capsule. I'm not saying Manos is some work of art. It's garbage don't get me wrong. But its still entertaining and a rare chance to see what happened when an everyday Joe took a camera and tried to make a movie 40 years ago.

$review_text.: For those coming unenlightened by previous experience with this film in its three decades of existence, expect nothing but variations on how to create horror with disgust. No doubt it has retained the power to do so successfully even to this day---at least if you are not in a setting where communal unease creates defensive laughter and mockery. You have to decide for yourself before watching. No doubt it is good horror but is it a good (as opposed to financially successful) movie. My opinion is not of any use on the subject; I would simply advise that this is a film best watched with a group of people. You will not emerge from it, unless, as I say, you attack its impact, feeling Good.

$REVIEW.: Even though it was a little difficult to follow at times, I still loved this story and so happy a film was made about these men saving the art that Hitler and his men tried to hoard or even destroy.  Was interesting to see that even though the war had ended, there were still pockets in Europe of Germans still wanting to fight so they had to be careful when entering buildings housing the art.  I guess one thing that, to me was disappointing and something that happens so much in our government is how these men put their lives on the line to do this and even fought to get it done but when they found the gold Hitler was hoarding, which helped tear down his empire, it wasn't them that got the credit but the ones in leadership in the US.  These men should be honored for their valor and bravery so if it's only through a movie that this is done then so be it.  We should support this film in every way because it is an important part of WWII history.

$review_text.: The age of the Hollywood western had its apex in the middle of the 20th century, then with the change of modern society in the 1960's, the western genre lost its allure and Hollywood abandoned westerns for other fare.  Thanks to Ted Turner and his love for American Western film making, the long lost western has been reborn in a big way.  Tom Selleck continues to impress audiences as a true western hero in the tradition of John Wayne.  Selleck is more than adequate for the part, big in body and big in acting skill.  He takes the part of Paul Cable, and turns his character into someone we can believe, like, and respect.Cable comes back from the Civil War months before its official end. He is tired of war and killing, and wants to return home to raise cattle in his home state of Arizona.  In trying to escape his wartime experiences, Cable runs into more trouble at home.  He finds his wife terribly embittered by his absence, and his home farm is now run by former union soldiers who are naturally hostile to a returning Confederate soldier.  Cable must not only fight to regain his farm, but he must also try to rekindle the love that has been lost in his marriage.The story by Elmore Leonard is a solid one and very believable.  There are no dull or boring scenes, the picture grabs you and holds you throughout.  Selleck is terrific as Paul Cable, fighting for his family, his woman, and his life.  Selleck once again establishes himself as a solid western actor in the mould of John Wayne.  He is every man's western hero. Selleck carries the picture on his broad shoulders with ease.  He is supported with a fine ensemble cast, including Suzy Amis as his embittered gritty wife, and Haley Joel Osment (of "The Sixth Sense" fame) in a minor role as Selleck's son.  Amis portrays a western pioneering woman in perhaps one of the most realistic role ever portrayed.  Too many times we see western wonmen portrayed as prissy and prim, dressed in their long skirts and blouses without a scuff or mark of western sand or dirt.  Amis' portrayal as Mrs. Cable breaks the mould; we see her with dirt and dust on her face, with sweat dripping in lines across her face, and with a surprising ability to hold her own with wagon reins in her hands, or for that matter, a rifle.  I personally welcome this portrayal of western women, as it is undoubtedly more realistic than the western wife sitting pretty in her muti-layered petticoats.  David and Keith Cariidine are fine antagonists in the fight for the family farm.  Harry Carey Jr. plays a small role as Selleck's father-in-law.As a collector of fine western films, I intend to keep "Last Stand at Saber River", as it is an excellent western film in the tradition of the great Hollywood westerns; it's not an epic, but it is fine film-making and will please those craving for a fine western drama. I recommend it.James "Konedog" Koenig

$REVIEW.: Friday The 13th part VII it was pretty apparent that Paramount wanted to a cross over with Freddy Kruger but Friday The 13th was owned by Paramount & NOES was owned by New Line so it wasn't going to happen so they decided on dong a telekenatic teen girl that's kind of like Carrie take on Jason & what you have is a solid winner. Now 1 bit of conterversy was The MPAA cut this movie down due to the gore cause in the late 80's The MPAA was really cracking down on gore for even the littlest bit of gore. Released in 1988 2 years after Jason Lives. Made for $2.8 million made $19 million. Directed by John Carl Beachler & he is a big time effects master which is why he had a big gore fest intended for this movie. He directed Troll I don't know if he anything to do with Troll 2. It stars Lar Park Lincoln as Tina Shepard, Susan Blu as Amanda Shepard, Terry Kiser as Dr Crews. Kevin Spirtas as Nick, Kane Hodder as Jason & Susan Jenifer Sullivan as Melissa. Story is this little girl named Tina runs away from home cause her parents & her father is abusive & she runs off & gets on a boat & her father begs her not to go she says she hates him & wishes he would die which unlocks her telkinatic powers & her father falls into the lake & dies. So 10 years later she has all this guilt so she sees this a  s  s hole Doctor who uses her. I mean he's a really hateable character. He is hateable for the right reasons when I complain about unlikeable characters it's when you are suppose to root for them like Anton Yelchin in The Fright Night remake.  You have these teens next door I didn't care about them 1 way or the other except for Nick who I found to be a likeable character. He has a thing for Tina. That night you have Tina upset over her father & Tina tries to use her powers to bring her father back instead she brings Jason back. This look is the most killer look for Jason. Tina wakes up at her house Dr Crews stresses her out some more then you have these 2 characters Michael & & Jane their car broke down & it's Michael's birhtday he's Nick's Cousin & he was going to throw a suprise party for him this plot point comes in soon. Jason gets Jane he grabs her holds her up to a tree stabs her in the neck right into the tree. Michael finds her Jason goes after him where he throws this spike object into his back. Meanwhil Nick invites Tina to the party while she's there she has a vision of what happpend to Michael so she runs home where she sees a spike on the side of the house she tells her Mom about it but it's gone. Meanwhile you have this couple out camping this guy is getting fire wood Jason punches through that guys back to his stomach. Then he takes care of the woman this was suppose to be a big kill where he takes the woman in the sleepiing bag slams it across a tree repeatidly but it was cut down to 1 time only. The next day Tina & Nick talk with each other then you have a realb  it  c  h of a character Melissa spying on them cause Tina tells Nick about mental problems that she has gone through. Melissa makes fun of her which angers Tina she breaks that necklace that her rich daddy gave her. Tina wants to leave & you have Dr Crews yelling at her it sets her off her powers where a TV almost hits Dr Crews. You have these 2 kids outside 1 of them decides to go skinny dipping. Jason takes a axe slams it into this guys forehead. He drowns the girl. Tina's Mom goes into Dr Crews office & she finds out that he's been using her daughter. She crews Crews out she finds the spike that was in the side of the house. Dr Crews is going to put Tina in a hospital against Mrs Shepard's wishes. Tina runs off & leaves in the car. They go after her. While she is driving Tina sees a vision of Jason killing her mother. She crashes the car. The rest is Jason killing these disposible characters & having fun with farm tools. He takes a sling blade & kills this girl named Maddy. You have this couple in a van Jason smashes this guys head to the size of a walnut which was a kill that was edited. The girl gets a party horn to the eye which was kind of funny. Jason goes in the house takes a butcher knife kills a guy in the kitchen then cuts another guys head off a kill that was edited. A girl is throw out a window to her death. Tina meets up with  Nick in the woods they come across Michael's body they get to her house she comes across some articles that Dr Crews has on Jason for whatever reason. She gets her dad's gun. Mrs Shepard & Dr Crews are lookikng for Tina. Mrs Shepard gets tired of Dr Crews BS she reads him the right act. Jason is having a great time with these tools he got from the tool shed he has a reaper & goes after Mrs Shepard & Dr Crews. Dr Crews uses Mrs Shepard as a sheild & she is killed. Tina goes to look for her Mom she runs into Dr Crews he tells her that she went back home Tina doesn't believe him cause she was just there so she knows he is lying & she doesn't trust him. Dr Crews gets a nice comupence when Jason uses a weed wacker another kill that was edited. Tina finds her her Mother dead & she comes across more of Jason's victims. Then you have this great battle with Tina Jason she uses her powers uproots a tree to tie Jason up downs a power line drops a live wire in a mud puddle. That doesn't stop Jason though she goes into the neighbor's house uses her powers to slow Jason down drops part of the roof on Jason. She goes back hom. Jason still ain't down Jason goes to the house Melissa gets an axe to the head. Tina uses her powers drops these hanging lights on Jason he falls into the stairs. They need to get out of the house Jason busts through a wall. Jason't going to kill Nick Tina uses her powers to squeeze Jason't mask very good effects with this weird liquid coming out of Jason't head. The mask breaks very good make up work for Jason's face. Tina uses her powers to take a cord & hang Jason she drops him in the basement he's still alive she uses her powers to fire nails at Jason pours gas on him open up the furnace & set him on fire. Tina & Nick get out of there the house blows up in a nice effect. As they hug on the dock Jason is still somehow alive Nick fires a gun at Jason Tina uses her powers brings her Dad back her dad drags Jason back down to the lake which her dad was suppose to look like  a skelton & not look human. The next morning Tina & Nick are taken away in an amulance the was suppose to end with Jason grabs a fisherman out of his boat cause John Carl Beachler had ideas for a sequel involing Tina & Nick which that would've been better than the part VII we got. The making of is great you also have workprint footage which is the only way to see the kills unedited cause the original negitives apparently been destroyed. When Daniel Farends was going through the negitives of the movies a memo from 1991 was found for the negitives for part VII to be destroyed. This was an excellent sequel despite the edits that were made the character of Tina I felt sorry for more than any of The FT13th characters & she goes through a lot of odds no matter if it's Melissa, Dr Crews or Jason. Jason having the time of his life with all the farm tools. 2 likeable characters. Despite the studio politics John Carl Beachler delivered. Lar Park Lincoln did a really good job. Kevin Spirtas was good. Susan Blu did a good job. Terry Kiser did what he needed to do & did a good job. Susan Jenifer Sullivan did a good job at what she needed to do. Kane Hodder was great & made an impression so good that he took over for Jason in the next 3 movies. Next review of The Friday The 13th franchise will be Jason Takes A Boat To Vancouver & Gets Pwnd In Manhatten.

$REVIEW.: From a smartly &#34;dive right into it&#34; opening to a steadily increasing build up in tension, this is 3/4ths of an enjoyable- if largely standard- haunted house flick. If something more had been done with the slightly different central premise of a technological approach to finding spirits, this might have even gone from good to great.Instead, we get dwindling returns as things go from paint-by-numbers to random and into dumb. Terrible finale, a good example of someone didn't know how to wrap everything up so they just kind of punted.

$REVIEW.: Carrie is actually 2 seperate movies: the first is about a granola-y teenage girl coming to terms with her body, rejecting her stern, southern mother's religion, and experiencing her life and sexuality in an open, free, 1970's kind of way. *yawn*The second movie starts so jarringly that it's as if the director suddenly remembered that he was supposed to be filming a horror film. It's this second part, so completely over the top and lacking in any subtlety, that propels Carrie into the stratosphere of unintended cinema comedy.Some personal reflections upon Carrie:I think we are so supposed to feel badly for Carrie, when she's doused with pig's blood during her moment of prom glory. Unfortunately, her tormentors scheme was so ingenious and audacious -so completely divorced from anything that would actually work in real life -and DePalma leads up to it by piling one scene of teen girl bliss upon another.. I'm ashamed to admit that I was laughing quite hard when the moment finally arrived.Incidentally.. Carrie's football-star date has a massive, blond afro/perm. Is it really very likely that an empty, tin bucket swinging into his head would knock him out cold?Several reviewers, including nominal Catholic Roger Ebert, have remarked that Carrie and her mother pray before a statue of Jesus. Actually, the statue has arrows sticking out of it, so it is of St. Sebastian (though a St. Sebastian strangely defaced with a troll like afro and bug-eyes.) Presumably DePalma made this switch when unable to think of a timely way to telekinetically crucify Carrie's mother (it's held that Sebastian was used for archery practice). The actress playing Carrie's mother gives the best (grindingly one dimensional but that's par for the course here) performance in the film and obviously has a lot of fun with her insane, southern fried bible belter.Sissy Spacek, a real life Texas prom-queen, was badly miscast in the lead of this film. The film obviously calls for a shy, mousy little girl. Spacek has the face of a tomboy and the shoulders of an olympic swimmer. She looks like she could lift her bullies over head without any telekinetic help. All the same, she does (when covered in blood and with eyes popped open) manage to acheive an unwholesome, Blair Witch like, force of nature quality. But then DePalma electrocutes another teen or sends one flying across the room and the effect is ruined.Several reviewers commented that they were disturbed by the film's amorality and lack of any redemption for it's characters. This is true, but personally I do not consider this a fault (and it wouldn't be the greatest of this particular movie's problems). Indeed, in a wider way it serves to make this film a perfect product of the decade it was produced in; for what were the 70's if not an insane attempt at suicide on a civilizational level? To finish this review with a comment on the 1970's in general: I'm simply glad they're over and that I don't remember but hardly anything of them.

$review_text.: Where's my spoon? Hang on, as I try something.In the 415 area code - mister, that's in the Bay area - two feuding journalists are about to make their respective papers the morning must-read. Tom Lane (David Sutcliffe) is one of *those* guys, such a smooth operator. He writes for the mighty San Francisco Sun. Tom has got his ducks in a row, career on the fast track, set to land his own television show any minute now. Tom claims a - ehm, how did he put it? - "21st century, metropolitan perspective" on politics and art. His work computer, when he checks it in the morning, routinely has fifty messages waiting for him.In New York, Rebecca and Henry, roommates of six months, have just gotten engaged. But is six months long enough for them to really get to know each other? Both sets of parents harbor deep concerns, and perhaps rightfully so. Rebecca Fine (Vikki Krinsky, very cute) comes from an affluent Jewish family in Los Angeles. Henry Kringle (Tommy Lioutas) is a kid from Wisconsin, raised on midwestern Christian values. Maybe their disparate backgrounds wouldn't have mattered this early, but Rebecca and Henry couldn't pass up on the opportunity to meet their impending in-laws. Henry invites Rebecca's parents to come visit in his home town of Dunston, Wisconsin where his own parents lurk- er, I mean, await. It's a recipe for nothing good can come of this.Back in the Bay area, Liz Madison (Dina Meyer), unlike Tom Lane, has her ducks in no row whatsoever. Liz is sort of a hot mess, y'all. She runs an advice column for the small town periodical, the Marin County Voice. She has got a scattershot grasp of her life right now, what with her recent divorce and an aversion to dipping her toe back into the dating pool. Liz draws a blank when her young niece, Jacqui (Alexia Fast), astutely asks, "How can you give advice on relationships when you don't even have one?" Way to put your hot aunt on the spot, kid. Oh, and this morning, when Liz powered up her computer, guess how many messages were waiting? One message.In the other narrative, both sets of parents indulge in ignorant social psychology (but you can call it "stereotyping"). Rebecca's mom, Suzie Fine (Wendie Malick), is talking smack about her prospective son-in-law: "And he better not ask her to convert, because Jews don't convert. We are the Chosen Ones, after all." (Never mind that the Fines haven't been to the temple in three years.) And then there's Henry's mom, Marilyn Kringle (Cynthia Stevenson), who does her bit of summing up: "Jewish people are very sensitive and high strung." It's suspected that the Fines and the Kringles are in for a spell of awkwaaard. Here's one such moment:- Rebecca (confirming her vegetarian preference): "I don't eat anything that smiles."- Mrs. Kringle: "Okay. Quiche. Takes an hour, tops. I can get a recipe from the Internet..."- Henry: "Mom, Rebecca, she doesn't eat cheese, either."- Mrs. Kringle (flustered): "Cheese can smile?"So much is made of the San Francisco Sun's recent acquisition of the floundering Marin County Voice. The Voice has been the dependable read for Marin County for the past 70 years, but circulation's dropped 16% from last year. To revive subscriptionship (if that's a word), Liz (the hot mess, remember?) retools her column, forsaking giving advice to them lonely hearts for the heartfelt editorial. And, apparently, Liz has a finger on the pulse of the community. Overnight, the Voice's readership increases. The Voice's turnaround success threatens Tom Lane's shot at a television show, and so his editor orders him to undermine Liz's column. And so was born Tom Lane's big city column dedicated to swift rebuttals of every little thing that Liz writes about. He ridiculous Liz's sensibilities as the "contemporary sentiment of a 19th century schoolmarm." Oh, snap.Note that the Wisconsin branch of Kringles has fully embraced their name. They celebrate Christmas with the intensity of a thousand suns. The Kringles have holiday-themed ring tones. They drive the Christmas mobile. They're ferocious in their participation in the annual neighborhood competition to see who could put up the best Christmas decorations. Their house looks like Santa's workshop if it exploded. I'm sure Wendie Malick can tamp down her snark, even when she espies that giant fiddler on the roof on the Kringles' roof. (Okay, the Kringles were only trying to make the Fines feel included in the holiday festivities, never mind that it comes off vaguely condescending (but remove the "vaguely" part). Maybe it's apt that Rebecca whimsically coins the whole thing "Christmukkah."Would you like a slice of that 1930s newsroom screwball? In His and Her Christmas (2005), Dina Meyer and David Sutcliffe are terrific in reviving that classic feud between two reporters who don't give an inch but inevitably fall in love. Meyer and Sutcliffe channel Hepburn & Tracy (Woman of the Year, 1942), Elizabeth Perkins and Kevin Bacon (He Said, She Said, 1991), and even Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte (I Love Trouble, 1994).Or maybe you prefer a madcap comedy of manners. Wendie Malick and Cynthia Stevenson drive this narrative. Will You Merry Me? (2008) plays up the anxiety attached not only to meeting your intended's parents for the first time but also in trying to find that common ground - or at least a neutral zone - between two conflicting life styles. Malick and Stevenson are so very funny as the two moms stubbornly at cross purposes. I love Malick's under-her-breath sarcasm and Stevenson's frequent freak outs. The kids initially just want to get married, but then their parents' influence begin to make them second guess. Can Rebecca and Henry hurdle the obstacles of warring cultures and holiday traditions? Meanwhile, the dads are mostly chill. I say "mostly" because Mr. Kringle does obsess about the house decorating contest. I have three favorite quotes from this one. One is the above "Cheese can smile?" There's Malick's "In the town of crazy, you're the mayor!" (Guess who she was talking to?) And then there's the family dinner where the families were debating the where and what and who of the wedding, and a Kringle remarks: "Rabbi? I don't think that's going to work. Henry isn't circumcised." Oh, yeah, that's uncomfortable.Huh. It just hit me that, of these two, His and Her Christmas may be the more family appropriate movie, if you're planning on watching these with the ankle-biters. For those wondering, yes, there is some sexual innuendo in Will You Merry Me?

Each critic speaks to a different facet of our common reality.If you studied existentialism in the 1960s and then somehow went on with your life, this movie will absolutely delight you.  No sacred cows.  There is even a hilariously looped subplot involving warring factions of professionals in the oneness business...The nice thing:  every character in the film ends up changed for the better.  It's a feelgood flick!  No one is left out of some frame of self-improvement, even the "detectives."But, as Nick Danger would have said, don't make a career out of it...

If you enjoyed "This Is Spinal Tap, "Waiting for Guffman," and "Best in Show," this program will delight you.  Please check this original out BEFORE the Americanized version (which is in the  works) hits our shores. Ricky Gervais has created a classic character in David Brent, the office manager from hell.  Gervais took a page from John Cleese's book and called it quits after two series (the Brit equivalent of American television seasons) so that the quality of the work would not deteriorate: What we are left with is a diamond of a series.

$review_text.: First of all, Grammys are for works of MUSIC, not cinema. However, were they for honoring the works of cinematic treasures, FOR KEEPS?, indeed, would be least worthy of any nods.Molly Ringwald's role choices began  to get sketchier after the 1986 release of PRETTY IN PINK. The 1987  romantic comedy THE PICK-UP ARTIST, featuring Robert Downey, Jr., was an  underrated delight, while the 1988 U.S. release of Jean-Luc Godard's  avant-garde KING LEAR, in which she portrayed &quot;Cordelia,&quot;  demonstrated her gift for more mature roles.Released January 1988,  before KING LEAR, FOR KEEPS? is a lifeless &quot;dramedy&quot; chronicling  the trials and tribulations of a high school couple who give birth to an  illegitimate child. &quot;Darcy&quot; (Molly Ringwald) is an ambitious  honor-roll student with aspirations in journalism, while &quot;Stan&quot;  (Randall Batinkoff, never seen or heard from again) is her shoe-selling  beau whose dream is to walk the halls of CalTech.Like most pictures that  probe teenage sexuality and unplanned pregnancy, the film portrays the  child as the mistake, not the decision its characters have made to engage  in sex before marriage. Such treatment is often labeled  &quot;realistic,&quot; since we know teenagers often partake in premarital  sex, as do most adults, for that matter. Just because it is  &quot;realistic&quot; doesn't make it morally or socially responsible.However, the issue of morality is never debated here, since the  filmmakers have chosen portray the decision these CHILDREN have made to  keep their baby, in a positive light. Indeed, any mother who decides to  raise her child and give it the gift of life is an honorable person.  However, when she has agreed to commit to that child before she has  committed to its father, she is making a mistake that will leave a negative  impact upon her, her child and its father.When &quot;Stan&quot; suggests  the idea of &quot;giving it up for abortion...adoption,&quot; he makes a  despicable Freudian slip. As a pro-life activist and a human being, this  odious line is so completely offensive, especially since it's played for  laughs.The ridiculous idea that &quot;Darcy&quot; may earn her diploma  by completing night school courses is not only entirely unfounded, it is  totally ridiculous. Night school courses are either general education  classes for dropouts or  enrichment courses for people who have already  graduated. An honor-roll student working for the school paper would be  undertaking a challenging courseload, not basic mathematics, home economics  or remedial English.Not surprisingly, FOR KEEPS? met with minimal  box-office success. I hesitate to say this because I so love her, but, the  train wreck that is this worthless picture is totally undeserving of the  fine talents of Miss Molly Ringwald.

$REVIEW.: Generally speaking, I run (screaming) from Jim Carrey movies


 This dude wore out his welcome back when Nirvana was cranking out hits
 Yet Jim's lone salvation in the comedy YES MAN is delectable and cuddly cute Zooey Deschanel; playing a free spirit romantic interest Zooey is a wonderful counter to Carrey's overplayed antics


 Which makes YES MAN an enjoyable experience, as a shallow loan officer who constantly says "No" to lenders has his life transformed via a rowdy seminar (like that plot's never been done before) and commits to saying "Yes" to everything he's asked

 Meanwhile he enters into a romance with very predictable results.While Carrey often gets chalkboard-scraping annoying, he does exhibit (on occasion) a delightful rustic charm

 For example, his guitar serenade to prevent a disturbed Luis Guzman from jumping off a ledge is the film's best feel-good moment


 There are similar little gems interspersed throughout the movie (an encounter with an elderly lonely neighbor being one of them) to offset Carrey's perpetual mayhem


 There's a sizable supporting cast (with only Terrence Stamp and Guzman standing out from the crowd) and the story is so predictable you can set your watch to it, yet YES MAN is fun because Zooey is so cute you forget Carrey's around.--D

$REVIEW.: Being a long time student of Ancient Roman history I was greatly looking forward to this screen depiction of the life of the Emperor Nero, one of Rome's most controversial Emperors famed for his persecution of the Christians and the cold blooded murder of most of his own family. It mystifies me as to why the film makers took the direction they did in depicting Nero as an innocent victim of his surroundings and upbringing when in actual fact the real Nero was far from ever being that. Perhaps in these "revisionist", times it isn't considered fashionable to show a famous, or in Nero's case I should say "infamous", figure as completely without some redeeming characteristics? It is hard to tell but I believe what would have been far more interesting to see would have been a cinematic study of the "real", Nero, complex and gruesomely fascinating character that he was, who rather than being a victim of circumstances was actually someone who struck terror into everyone close to him and who was solely responsible for the cold blooded murder of totally innocent family members, senators and most famously of all the early Christians, during his reign as Rome's fifth Emperor.All the above is not to say that this production of "Nero", is not an interesting film to watch. Quite the opposite actually and if the viewer examines the film in the knowledge that it is above all else well constructed historical fiction it actually can be seen as a first rate production in regards to solid performances, excellent costumes and authentic historical settings that reveal a great deal of care and attention to detail being put into its planning. However for any individual with a good knowledge of Nero's reign and the personalities that inhabited it, viewing this production of "Nero", can easily become an extremely frustrating viewing experience as one piece of historical fantasy follows another.

Duvall carries the film, but the performances by Bill Murray, Lucas Black, and Sissy Spacek deserves recognition as well.This movie is more of a character study than anything else. There are no villains, and the antagonists either 1) have basically cameo appearances in the plot, like the bully taunting Duvall's character early in the story or 2) develop into decent human beings, like Murray's funeral director.My personal opinion: The great acting was not matched by the story. I've read some reviews giving this movie 2 and 3 stars because they felt let-down, and I understand where they're coming from. I loved the acting, but I felt I wouldn't have missed anything if I didn't see the movie. In spite of that, though, it made great points on the need of forgiveness,  not just from other people but from God Himself.This movie is rated PG-13. I think it's appropriate for teenagers, though they may disagree because they might consider it too slow moving. There is some language in the movie which the rating explanation doesn't mention, but that language is at the minimal.If you enjoy great acting, you shouldn't miss this treat. It's not the best picture around, but it still is well made and doesn't insult one's intelligence or conscience.

Ok, I laughed at that part!), simpleminded plot, humans that go from stone age to fighter pilots overnight... the list goes on. I always thought Plan 9 from Outer Space had to be the worst movie of all time but it's got Battlefield Earth beat!This isn't even a Camp or Cult film, it's just BAD!

$review_text.: This episode has caused me one hell of a headache:1. I also had the faulty audio version as part of an order late last year 2010.2. I only found the problem recently and on checking the feedback here, realized that I was not alone.3. I contacted Customer Service by email and they agreed to replace the item at no cost to me. I carefully explained that there was a new version of the Blu-ray which I of course wanted as my disc was not just 'one-off' defective.4. A new order was created, but on checking my account found that the new order was infact for the same faulty version.5. Once again I contacted Customer Service, this time by the "CHAT" method. After about one hour of discussion, I think I have a resolution, but to get there was an epic and I'm still not convinced that the message has gotten through that there are two versions of this Blu-ray in their system, one of which is a re-issue by the manufacturer of the previous defective one.6. The simplest solution to this, was to cancel the new replacement order of the faulty title and for me to manually re-order the newer version. For some reason, they were not able to simply swap in this order to the re-issue!I've been assured that I'm still going to get refunded for the original order.7. Assuming that my replacement is okay in all respects, I've still only given this Blu-ray 4 Stars as I don't think the VIDEOon both the contained movies is as good as many of the titles that are being re-issued.It's certainly not bad, but nothing like the apparent original resolution that is being realized these days. Infact I maybe going out on a bit of a limb here, but video wise, this Blu-ray release is no better than what would be available on a standard DVD. The advantage though I suppose, is getting the two movies on one disc.8. Why the original, which has obviously been acknowledged by the manufacturer as defective is still in the system, escapes me.

$review_text.: coming from Latin America I cannot see how WalMart is actually a good thing... unless I shop at bargain prices here in their US stores.  People against this documentary might say that purchasing goods from Third World countries brings wealth... and it does, to the factory owners who provide products at a real low cost by underpaying workers in nations where law enforcement is nowhere to be found.Have you noticed how the negative reviews are themselves quoting "newspapers reviews"?  And all those "newspapers reviews are extremely negative?  Well, it's this simple: If the newspapers print positive things about this documentary, thus endorsing negative comments on WalMart, then WalMart simply won't buy any more publicity from them, just like in my own country with the mass-market retailers.But don't believe the hype, and see for yourself!  Better yet, if you feel China is becoming an economic giant capable of destabilizing your beloved America, you can thank WalMart's millions going there for that, instead of staying in America to purchase goods made by americans.

$review_text.: I was raised on American folk lore, so this was pretty much obligatory to watch. It actually has decent production values. This film reminds me of a cross between an Asylum (Sci-Fi) picture and Hatchet (if you haven't seen Hatchet, go watch it!). I had fun watching it and would recommend it to anyone who likes semi-gory horror tales with a comedic (but not stupid comedic) tone. The actors work well with each other and it looks like they had a good time filming this. I would recommend watching this if you are even slightly interested; it is far, far, above 80% of the horror movies and it is not one of those filmed with a $3 budget that look like a messy, VCR quality picture.

I don't see how they will continue with the series if they keep changing the story up. These books have plenty of action on it's own. Changes and additions are unnecessary.

$review_text.: For most of this film I thought this doesnt make sense. The story just seemed dumb. But towards the end you see the big twist and scheme led by Jennifer Aniston and everything made sense. I didnt care for the beginning but the last part of the movie was good. I just thought Clive Owen getting away with everything he did at the end of the movie was very unrealistic. I believe he kills 2 men at 2 different times and gets lucky by not getting caught. Then he embezzels and just gets community service.But loved Clive in this film. I loved how he grabbed Jennifer Aniston and ran with her across the street and kisses her in an alley. What a passionate actor he is.Nicole M*

$REVIEW.: What happens when a free-wheeling English playboy takes on a charmless, machine-like Austrian for the Formula One Drivers&#8217; World Championship?  Sparks fly, and a fiery crash at the &#8220;Green Hell&#8221; Nurburgring nearly takes the life of one of them.  Based on the true-life rivalry between Englishman James Hunt and Austrian Niki Lauda, with Chris Hemsworth (&#8220;Thor&#8221;) as Hunt and Daniel Bruhl (&#8220;The Bourne Ultimatum&#8221;) as Lauda.  With a paltry (by Hollywood&#8217;s standard) $30 million budget, director Ron Howard filmed on location with minimal computer-aided imagery, employed vintage F1 machines when possible, and sought the advice of F1 drivers.  Coupled with with an unerring eye for authenticity, Howard has produced a stunning recreation of 1970&#8217;s-era F1 racing, with near-perfect stand-ins for Hunt and Lauda.Cramming a 16-race season into a 122-minute film, however, makes &#8220;Rush&#8221; seem, well, rushed.  That said, the movie is a winner.

$review_text.: What thw heck is up with Joel Schumacher? First Batman Forever, which was a 3 star movie even though he used up the best bad guys and it wouldn't have been that hard to make an excellent 5 star movie. I think Schumacher's spending too much movie on the special effects and not the actual movie. This is what you call trash. Why is Arnold in this movie????????? Is Schumacher crazy???????? Arnold SHOULD ONLY BE CASTED IN MOVIES WHERE HE IS THE STAR!!! EVEN THOUGH MOST OF HIS MOVIES ARE BRAINLESS, THEY'RE GREAT FUN!!! But why would you put him in this movie?Jim Carrey would have been even better for the role! I mean come on! First off, I hate this movie because Batman movies are better without Robin. He's rather annoying. The first two and the new one were good because they were much darker. But robin makes this one seem kiddy. Secondly, George Clooney is not a good Batman! Why would he be a good batman? He isn't good at all! Whoopi Goldberg or George W. Bush would have even been better choices! And lastly, the 3 vilains in this movie (Mr. Freeze, Baine and Poison Ivy) are probably some fo the weakest of all. Bane should have been the main bad guy because he's such a neat guy. Also, why does Bain look like he weighs 50 lbs without the venom? He should weight more than that! I mean come on! This movie depresses me because Batman is my favorite comic book character and this movie completely degraded the character. Also, Batgirl wasn't necessary... Don't make me go there....Terrible movie, stay FAR away.

$REVIEW.: DARK DESCENT is about as exciting as watching someone make banana pudding.  Filmed in Czechloslovakia, most of the actors and crew's names end in "v".  Which wouldn't be so bad if they could at least ACT.  Dean Cain, he of Superman fame, bullies his way through the mess, chewing his gum, and wincing after he gets shot in the leg.  Scott Wiper who plays his jealous comrade mercifully disappears once he quits, but the movie never says what happens to him.  The movie starts off with Cain and Wiper (sounds like a law firm, don't it?) facing some really nasty guys who are obviously attacking the women in this undersea mining plant.  Nothing is ever explained as to why they are doing this, but Cain kills them all but one, a nasty guy who plans revenge.  Meanwhile, many of the crew members are committing suicide, and Cain is investigating.  (Excited yet?).  Of course, it all culminates in a kind of underwater HIGH NOON when the bad guy who promised to come back, does so with two other goons, and chase Cain around the plant for a while.  There is nothing exciting about any of this, as the direction is wooden and the acting abysmal.Try THE ABYSS or GHOST SHIP or any other undersea film, and you'll do much better than this waste of celluloid.

$REVIEW.: Simba's daughter can be described in one word: Rebellious.  That seems to be the theme of Disney sequels these days...the main character's daughter/son (Usually daughter) is a rebellious adventurer who wants nothing more then to break away from the character we loved so much in the original movie.  I personally find that plot to be over-used and a first-movie-ruiner.  It's hard to feel the same about the original movie when the second movie is such a bummer.This movie was okay, not great.  It was definately more violent and evil in some parts then the original The Lion King.  Although Kiara was possibly a prettier lion then Nala, I found her to be slightly too emotional, and I didn't like that she was always trying to get away from, and take control of, almost everyone's favorite character, Simba.  I find the whole "family/descendants of Scar" thing to be a little odd, too, since Scar would have had his family back him up in the first movie instead of the hyenas. And I THINK I remember Zira saying she was Scar's sister.  Wouldn't that make her Mufasa's sister, too?  Anyway, I liked this movie when I was around six or seven years old, and still like it now.  But I think a lot of things could have been different, and I definately don't think it was as good as the original movie.

$review_text.: As someone who watches many films, and someone who usually likes classy, Hollywood, Academy-type films, I am sorry to say that I have a weakness for Rob Schneider.  His gross-out humor usually gets under my skin and makes me laugh.  But in the Benchwarmers, he uses it so frequently that this film misses its mark completely.  The film follows Gus (Schneider), Richie (David Spade), and Clark (John Heder, reprising exactly his role from Napoleon Dynamite, minus the hair) as three losers who never got a shot in high school.  Gus is a landscaper and he comes across Howie, who is getting picked on by the local baseball team.  The scene that proceeds is completely unneccessary, as the viewer finds out what a "beef stew" really is (and boy, do we find out).  This isn't the worst part of this scene, as Clark tries to taste and smell the beef stew.  Schneider comes up with a brilliant idea: to have the three guys play little league teams in order to get the nerdy kids to be able to play on the field.  Howie takes them to meet his father Mel (John Lovitz) who once was a nerd in high school, but has grown up to make billions, and he even owns the car from Knight Rider and the Batmobile.  Mel devises a plan to build a life size baseball stadium, and creates a tournament where the winner gets the stadium.  Gus, Richie, and Clark enter the tournament in hopes to win it for the nerds.The film has about twenty minutes (at most) of laughs.  The rest of the film is Deuce Bigalow-esque gross out humor (I half expected a lady with male genitalia on her face to come in) and a ridiculous scene involving a thirty-something Mexican guy who says he is twelve.  The film has a few laughs ("Makers of what?  Poop?), but the rest is just Schneider trying to make us sick.  John Heder shows no acting talent whatsoever, playing Napoleon Dynamite minus the red afro.  He eats everything under the sun, from dead bugs to boogers and I really got tired of it.  Spade has his moments, and he probably comes in second as the funniest character in the movie (the lewd old guy in the video store comes in first, and he only has about a minute and a half of screen time).  The one thing that made me angry about this movie was that, as a filmmaker, one has to make me feel bad for these kids that are getting picked on.  They don't.  If anything, the film seems to be making fun of these kids rather than trying to help them (one scene involves a kid who spits out a lake everytime he talks; it's quite unneccessary).  The only justification that these kids get is a kind of sweet scene at the end involving a midget (in a pretty predictable twist in plot).  Other than that, the film isn't worth spending nine or ten bucks on seeing in the theater, much less a video rental.

$review_text.: I included some of the movie's dialog to get the prospective viewer interested in certain aspects of the movie. So if that is a spoiler for you, please stop here!Said and Khaled are young Palestinian friends who are recruited to go on a suicide bombing mission against the Israelis. During their scary journey of decision they express their emotional struggle when contemplating the possibility of killing innocent whilst remembering their oppressed past and hopeless future.The brain washing used to recruit young men that plays on their pain and beliefs, like bacteria on an open wound, are shown through many discussions like what the recruiter said:" What can you do when there is no justice or freedom? Then there's the individual that is forced to fight for it. If we give in to the law that says, the strong devour the weak, then we become the animals. That's intolerable. Death is better than inferiority. That means whoever fights for freedom, can also die for it."The two friends strike a friendship with one of the guys love interest who is an open minded and educated woman. Dialog is the main tool in the movie to describe how difficult it is to get humans to let go of their hatred. The erudite young lady argues with them: "That's no sacrifice. That's revenge. If you kill, there's no difference between victim and occupier."The dialog again shows how young men face the decision of killing themselves and others as Said puts it: "Even worse, they've convinced the world and themselves that they are the victims. How can that be? How can the occupier be the victim? If they take on the role of oppressor and victim then I have no other choice but to also be a victim and a murderer as well. I don't know how you'll decide, but I will not return to the refugee camp."Eventually, the conversations become simply cold lectures, but some credit should be given to the honesty and truthfulness while exploring the problem of suicide attacks. This is an attempt to convince the extreme Palestinians to snap out of physical fighting and ponder the thought of dialogue and civilized thinking.Watch and think for yourself, you might learn something!

My husband rented 3 movies that night, and this one was a "token" chick flick "for me."He put off watching it the first night, but the second night we watched it because the other movie was way too long.  We were both moved by this movie and came away absolutely "in love" with it.  My husband even had to admit that "my movie" was an "us movie."This movie is just really fun to watch and takes you on a journey that involves so many emotions--just what to look for in a good film.

Dana Barron (Sigourney Weaver) has a child now and works at a museum now, but unfortunately a new painting has arrived featuring legendary renissance warrior/sorcerer Viggo (Wilhem Von Hemburg) and it's cursed especially a river of slime underneath the city of New York that causes evil spirits.

Reunited with Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) and Janine (Annie Potts), the incredible four must stop the forces of evil on New Year's eve before Vigo can possess Dana's child and take over the world.Very entertaining and underrated sequel! Sure it doesn't have any of the sheer brilliance or excellence that made the first movie a classic but this is still an exciting sequel with good laughs. The creature effects and special effects are done by Industrial Light and Magic, i think they are well done effects including on the Scareli Brothers sequence in the court. The acting is good and the storyline isn't too bad, the film offers a couple of appearences by Cheech Marin and Ben Stein and this is worth another look.This DVD offers great picture and sound but a lack of extras as the only extras is filmographies of crew and stars and trailers to this and other Sony releases. "Ghostbusters 3" is coming soon for real, i can't hardly wait.

 Kirstin Dunst is brilliantly cast as Hearst's lifelong mistress, actress Marion Davies, and the supporting cast in this fluid, Altman-esque ensemble piece is also quite strong
 The script could have been more merciless towards Hearst (longtime nemesis of Bogdanovitch's patron, Orson Welles), but the humanity it imparts on the bazillionaire is what makes this a real film, and not just another movie

$review_text.: Adapted from the novel of the same name by the Georgian writer Carson McCullers and directed by the great John Huston, REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE stars Marlon Brando, an army officer on a military post somewhere in the South, and Elizabeth Taylor as his bored wife. There is a lot going on here. Brando plays a latent homosexual who is being cuckolded right under his nose by another officer Brian Keith who is married to a fragile mental case, Julie Harris. Ms. Harris, who has just cut off her nipples with scissors when the movie begins, is cared by by an effeminate Asian houseboy. Add to this mixture a young soldier (Robert Forster) who has a propensity for riding horses bareback and with a bare backside.I have seen this movie three or four times now and can never decide if it's me or the movie; but I never get all the parts fitted together. This film certainly is worth watching and has an erotic mystery about it. Elizabeth Taylor repeats a part she had done before of the beautiful Southern woman and does a credible job with her Southern accent. But by far the best thing about this movie is Marlon Brando. He of courses acts in every frame and is perfect as the army officer about ready to go to pot who struggles with his forbidden desires.I do not remember what kind of reviews this movie received in 1967, but Brando gives one of his best performances here. The critics should have so stated.

$REVIEW.: Tommy Boy(released Mar/95),stars SNL actors David Spade and Chris Farley in their first and best movie together.Chris Farley is at least given somewhat of a decent plot to work with and,unlike Black Sheep,Spade wasn't comedically emasculated and his acerbic wit and sarcasm are left intact and make a good counterpoint to Farley's character of a man-child.The plot involves the Callahan family.Tommy(Farley)graduates college,finally after seven years(!),and returns home to Sandusky to his father's car parts business.His father Tom Sr.(Brian Dennehy) welcomes the newly graduated Tommy home with open arms and gives him an office position right away.Tom Sr.has been widowed for some time and he decides to get married to one Beverley Burns(Bo Derek),who has a "son" Paul(Rob Lowe).At the wedding reception Tom Sr.takes a heart attack and passes away leaving the entire business to Beverley.But the business needs a loan it can't get and the only hope the firm has of staying afloat is for Tommy to hit the road to try and sell their new line of quality brake pads.With the aid of Tom Sr.'s former assistant Richard(Spade)they travel the open roads but get no where fast,due to Tommy's inexperience and Richards lack of delivery.Finally through perseverance the pair come up with a winning strategy and the orders start coming in.Eventually they compile enough to virtually save the company.Things are looking good for Callahan auto parts but a wrench is thrown into things in the form of Beverley's son Paul.He changes the computer records and out going shipments get all fouled up and the customers are cancelling orders.In the meantime both Richard and the former receiver/shipper have seen Paul and Beverley kissing in a very non-motherly/son way.It is found out they are husband and wife.Into the mix comes Ray Zalinsky(Dan Akroyd),the auto parts "king" out of Chicago,who offers to buy up Callahan.At the takeover board meeting Tommy and Richard come in in a very unconventional manner and force Ray to listen to what's been going on;such as the changing of their records and the fact Beverley is married to Paul which makes the marriage to Tommy's father illegal.Callahan's actually belongs to Tommy  now and he isn't selling it to Ray.But he does manage to finagle an order for an astounding 500,000 brake pads out of him.The company is saved.The film has lots of Farley-esque touches like his "holy schnike" line(pronounced like Nike,the shoe),his "for the love of Gawwwd" line,his hyperactive gesturing and his getting so mad it looks like every blood vessel in his body will burst.Spade of course is in fine form with his dry humour and rolling but slit eyes at Farley's faux pauxs.The story is one you can get behind even though it's as see through as tissue paper.There are some laughable moments here and there like the deer in the car and the slow but steady trashing of Spade's 60s car/baby.Michaels,the creator of SNL,goes back to his old stomping grounds and filmed this one in and around the Toronto area.The Gooderham and Worts Distillery there is the home of Callahan's auto parts.Technically this film looks good and is clear and crisp.It is in its w/s a/r and there are two DVDs.Extras include:four featurettes,6 deleted scenes,8 alternate takes,15 extended scenes,a gag reel,the trailer and more.All in all a reasonably good film from the Farley/Spade duo.The plot is simple but the stars make the most of their screen time.Brian Dennehy is very good as Tommy Sr

and Dan Ackroyd makes a nice surprise visit as Ray the auto parts king.For fans of this film,this edition is certainly all the schnike you can get!



$SUMMARY.: The best of the Farley/Spade films-3 1/2 stars.

but this one is more accurate to the book 





and I love the book

I think it is a matter of preference 








I know some people who saw this movie and totally hated it and others like me found it better then the original


Those who like Tim Burton movies and/or Johnny Depp are going to really enjoy this
I think the two movies are so extremely different that you can be a fan of both versions.

$REVIEW.: Perhaps the best way to summarize the feeling you'll receive from Jack the Giant Slayer is this: Welcome back, Bryan Singer; You are indeed forgiven for Superman Returns, sir.No, really, it is THAT good.It is good enough to make you forget that horrid moment when Superman was getting dragged hair- and face-first by some nameless goons (oh and Kumar), and he managed to let out a desperate, horrifically out-of-character scream of, &#8220;I'm still Superman!&#8221;For those of you who know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about

For those of you who are going to zip on over to YouTube or dig through your guilty pleasure collection and fast-forward that fumbled rehash of the Richard Donner and Christopher Reeves era with the subtitles on: You.Were.WARNED &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Did you see it?Awful, right? And now you can't UN-see it

You're welcome.BUT! Even though you can't erase the memory I've just Incepted you with, you can certainly run down to your local theater now and use the epically fun Jack the Giant Slayer to cleanse your mental palette.Now, I'm not sure how many people have been following the development of this film

After all, Singer certainly didn't exactly help his Hollywood credibility following up Superman Returns by throwing a Nazi uniform on Tom Cruise (though, for the record, Valkyrie was good!)
Perhaps the uh Stanley Tucci fans? Ewan McGregor fans? Did they forget the Jedi-mullet?  In any case, based on the weekend receipts and projections, it's not going to be pretty, and the studio did jack squat (see what I did there) to help this picture by showcasing the films worst instances of CGI in the trailers and utilizing that beat-to-death marketing campaign of flooding a trailer with utterances of the titular character's name (looking at YOU, Parker!).The poor box office is simply a travesty


Let's not forget Singer gave us one of the greatest superhero movies of all time in X-Men 2 AND he wrote the story for the much-beloved X-Men: First Class (which people seem to forget when they claim every X-film before First Class was trash, but I digress)
Not to mention the powerful Apt Pupil and everyone's favorite pimpin' limpin' villain in The Usual Suspect's Keyser Soze.After that, we OWE it to Singer, dammit, because this film is so good


And you know what MAKES this movie so good? Singer had the balls to break the conventions we would've pointed to to justify the feeble box office, and both the storytelling and action were so tight that you can almost picture Singer going, &#8220;Yeah, remember me? Remember what I can do?&#8221; Well, I pictured it, and I certainly was forced to remember what he's capable of.The film, like any other, has flaws, ranging from the miscasting of King Brahmwell (Ian McShane (should have been Bernard Hill)), a Padme-and-Anakin-esque conversation between Jack (Nicholas Hoult) and Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) early on, and distracting aesthetics like Jack's hoodie and Elmont (McGregor)'s Team Edward haircut

Not to mention some video-game-level CGI that goes into the giants, which we all should've been aware of going into the theater.However, the key to any good story is not to be free of flaws but to be alive and organic enough to essentially force the audience to get over them because the ride is just that gripping
Such was the case with Jack the Giant Slayer

It would have been so easy for Singer to regurgitate all the trappings of fantasy and adventure storytelling into a quick cash-machine without putting any thought and energy into the subtle complexities (looking at YOU this time, Wreck-It-Ralph)

Instead, there is care put into virtually every aspect of this film


Upon every instance of you as the audience starting to believe you've got a bead on what's going to happen next, this movie utterly smashes your expectations and puts together something even better.You want specifics, you say? Well, first of all, this movie is full of characters who actually THINK
It's a sad state of our modern movie-going experience when we can watch a movie free of characters who are stupid because the plot demands they should be stupid

Sure, Jack must make that initial exchange for the Magic Beans as the classic fairytale dictates, but his curiosity was piqued early on by his father telling him stories of an ancient war with a race of giants that reside in a cloud kingdom, and Jack wasn't the only one


Isabelle receives a joint bedtime story exposition sequence and acquires a taste for adventure from her royal mother (which is perhaps all-too-familiar for the five of us who saw Hellboy II: The Golden Army)

Following the death of both of these orating parents (which should've been given a scene), Jack is left in the hands of a cruel uncle and Isabelle her protective father.A chance encounter with Isabelle in town plants the seeds of romance for these two, and Jack gets a taste of her world, which entails constant supervision by the elite King's Guardians, headed by McGregor's Elmont and his trusty second-in-command Crawe (Eddie Marsan), who also required an additional scene to round them out
After Jack and Isabelle inevitably receive their scoldings from their guardians for being too naive, the former is left steaming and in possession of the beans, while the latter flees from both the castle and her arranged marriage to the boundlessly ambitious and ruthless Roderick (Stanley Tucci)
Isabelle happens upon Jack's cottage while his uncle is out attempting to rectify Jack's misguided transaction, and following that at-times painful exchange I mentioned before, one of the beans gets wet, sprouts, and we're off to the races!What follows is wonderful example of what can get done in fantasy/action-adventure films when the writer and director have zero tolerance for a stale and meandering plot

Once Jack is discovered at the bottom of the beanstalk, absent princess-in-distress, a rescue party is dispatched, and both Jack and Roderick inevitably join up in the race to retrieve Isabelle before the giants realize they've got a route to wage war on humanity once again
At this point you may start to mentally prepare yourself for yet another drawn-out journey where the company is able to rescue Isabelle and in the process exhibit all that is right with Jack and all that is wrong with Roderick; add a dash of blatant set-piece action, a sniveling coward character for comic relief, and a moment when the leading woman takes her place amongst the boys by being the one to stop the war and save everyone's collective ass, and we're set, right?Wrong.Not only does this story have brains, it has guts.Secondary characters are forced to don red shirts and walk the tight-rope.Roderick's personal goon (Ewen Bremner) is much scarier than he has any right to be.Isabelle sees Jack for who he is on his own merits and not in stark contrast to Roderick, whose motives aren't allowed to simmer for 90 minutes before a grand betrayal.And the giants do make it down to the ground to go Gojira on our structures and devour humans in brutal (albeit in blood- and gore-free) fashion.The heroes are roughly thrust into an impossible situation and forced to handle it, and it feels so good to find a storyteller who does not fall so in love with his own creations that they are unwilling to take this sink-or-swim approach


To those of you who cringed at the CGI displayed in the trailers, allow me to assuage your apprehensions by saying Singer smartly films in a manner to keep the giants and humans separate for the majority of the movie, and everything that should have been a physical prop, WAS a physical prop

There's even a scene where one of hour heroes is about to be turned into a pastry and you can watch the giant crepe bread they've been wrapped in BAKE

And the scale and pace of the action was just unapologetically both brutal and fun


The King gets hands-on and makes sacrifices to drive home the severity of the threat

Furthermore, the tactics and innovations in the climactic battle make it clear that the giants and humans have been preparing for the possibility of another war for a very long time, and the battle is sprinkled with glorious tide-swinging moments up until the final charge.AND, when the short-lived World War Giant II is over, we're given the cherry on top in the form of a foreboding wink that Singer has perfected.I freely admit that perhaps the reason why I enjoyed this movie so much was because I let it catch me off-guard
I went in with tempered expectations
And no doubt some of you will now watch the film after I've hyped it up and be disappointed

But don't come back and say it sucked
And don't even say that the film's quality exists in a vacuum unsullied by the audience's interpretation
Instead, simply join me in saying: Welcome back, Bryan Singer; You are indeed forgiven for Superman Returns, sir.

$review_text.: BOSTON LEGAL: SEASON 4 - 2007The loss of Brad is a serious blunder but the three protagonists William Shatner, James Spader and Candice Bergen can still hold it together. After recovering from the weak word salad gag from the first season, Alan Shore gives a speech to Denny on the balcony about losing his virginity. It is a masterful piece of acting. Shatters reactions are priceless.The magic that these two have is a wonder to behold.I don't mind Saffron Burrows. Not at all as good as Tara but still hot.There are lots of new characters this season. There has been a good cleanout. I love the introduction of the Brit, Tara Summers. She is a very good actor. Her delivery of `the `dog's bollocks' was spot on. The Fat Black transvestite is gone and I for one am glad. I felt his performance was unconvincing in either character. The introduction of John Larroquette is iffy because Cadice Bergun has better taste. Denny would be crushed at how low she has gone. Christian Clemenson is a very good actor. I do hope `Hands' doesn't turn into a lolly pop boy.The Season has started strongly for a change and "Do Tell" is a finely worked play but for that stupid word salad number. James Spader is too good an actor for those unconvincing gags.Brad Chase played by Mark Valley has left to be a district Attorney, which is a bit of a shock considering the pay cut. What a talent is missing from the threesome. I don't mind the black girl with the wig. Taraji P. Henson. (Is she related to the Muppets? ) It must be hard to enter into a great show with such presence. I think she pulled it off but is it a wig designed by a Henson?I still miss Tara but I have heard from inside sources that she is shooting people in Hollywood, so beware. Brad, I know I will miss. All hail the threesome.BOSTON LEGAL: SEASON 3The first four episodes of Boston Legal Season three are very weak and provide a shakey start to this Classic American television series. Thankfully the following episodes soar in quality and the series returns to its confident and often brilliant best. The standout episodes are "Lincoln" and "On the Ledge".The problems with series three are simple. Poor casting is solely responsible for the weaker points in the show. The casting of Craig Bierko and Gary Anthony Williams are serious own goals. Craig Bierko is a comedy actor of sorts and it shows. His scenes have a lack of authenticity about them, as if he knows he is being funny. This actor does not have enough charm or talent to pull off the part of an intelligent and wisecracking lawyer. His underwritten part is not sure whether to be another Alan Shore or Brad Chase when really we need neither. Luckily he is conspicuously absent from all the latter episodes.Gary Anthony Williams is also a poor piece of casting. The actor is completely unconvincing and overplays his part ridiculously. He never listens to the other actors and continues to mug or make stupid facial expressions, which are distracting especially when he is not the focus of the scene. I think the theatrical term is "upstaging". The love interest he has with the Constance Zimmer is completely unconvincing because there is no chemistry between the two actors.That said the confirmed magic between Shatner and Spader is ever present. It is simply a joy to watch these brilliant actors at work. Candice Bergen is as riveting as ever. She is a wonderful Actor. Mark Valley is constantly underused but when he is lucky enough appear in an episode and show us how good he can be as an actor it often proves to be a highlight of the series.Constance Zimmer is very good addition to the cast but her part is woefully underwritten. I would like to see her become an honorary man in the eyes of Danny and Shore.Christian Clemenson delivers a perfectly pitched performance. Julie Bowen as always is perfect. Anthony Heald and the superb Henry Gibson need to be mentioned for their hugely enjoyable performances. All the other cast members are excellent but I would like to see the return of Christopher Rich.I feel the loss of Parker Posey from the cast roster was a shame as she portrayed a very compelling character that could have caused greater conflict within the Law Firm. I still feel the show misses Tara significantly.As a whole Season 3 keeps getting better and better because the writers realise that concentrating on the main relationships of the series makes for better episodes.BOSTON SEASON: One & Two"Boston Legal" is that rare American show that is both intelligent and original. The result is a completely compelling and engrossing "tele-visual feast".The almost magical chemistry between Shatner and Spader is remarkable to behold. This is a casting coup if there ever was one. Their relationship is beautifully played and completely life affirming. It is so good to see William Shatner being given the chance to perform in a part that demands of his talent. He has always been an extraordinary showman and it is a crime that it has taken so long to acknowledge just how good he is.Spader has a charm and perverseness as an actor that is hard to quantify. He has such allure and grace. His delivery of such very complicated and complex speeches is a master class for all in his profession. His performance, as is Shatner's, is simply brilliant!The actors are of course served with perceptive and enlightened scripts, that cry out for change in modern America. The scripts are never preachy and yet always funny. These scripts are excellent examples of great American screen writing, which more often that not is becoming harder to find.The casting is generally excellent. The loss of Rhona Mitra in the second series is a terrible blow. She is a very good actor and sorely missed. Mark Valley is also a hidden gem. Some of the best episodes involve his "Mannix" aspirations and his bouts of rapid verbal dexterity. The inclusion of Cadice Bergen to the heady mix of Shatner and Spader is a masterstroke. She is such a superb actor with an extraordinary depth. Her ability to deliver speeches with such brilliant clarity and simple emotion is a wonder to behold. Julie Bowen is another great addition to the second series. She is simply excellent. Her range of facial expressions seems limitless! Another casting coup is the inclusion of the talented Parker Posey towards the end of the second series. This is simply an inspired piece of casting. I hope her character will be developed further, as Parker Posey is an actor with a rare talent that includes precise comic timing. Anthony Heald and the superb Henry Gibson need to be mentioned for their perfectly pitched and hugely enjoyable performances. One actor in particular almost steals the show from Spader in the episode called "Legal Deficits". His name is Christopher Rich and he plays to perfection a creepy, ingratiating Texas Attorney. The scene between Rich and Spader is one of the most electrifying and satisfying in the whole series.The only criticism I have of "Boston Legal" is the development of the only completely unbelievable character in the series. Catherine Piper played unsympathetically by Betty White. Her performance is completely at odds with the rest of the show and cast. Her performance tries to be funny but is far from it. At one point she tells Alan Shore before his closing "I hope you're good!" The line falls completely flat. She then comments after his closing "I thought you would be better!" Again the line rings hollow as if it is played knowingly for laughs. This kind of unsubtle acting is simply out of style with the rest of the cast. I keep hoping her character will be written out, as she is the only negative in an almost perfect show, but no! She now quite unconvincingly evicts a young associate from his office and is pushing a tea trolley around!That said "Boston Legal" is an addictive show. One episode is never quite enough! Everyone involved in the show should feel blessed to be working on something truly special and original. This series will soon be regarded as the classic it most certainly is.

$review_text.: June 1 is the anniversary of Leslie Howard's death. If you dig up historical and contemporary articles and pour through the Wikis on Leslie Howard and his son Ronald Howard (7 April 1918 - 19 December 1996), you'll find information about the many consequences of this movie both wonderful and tragic. As a WW2-influenced remake of "Scarlet Pimpernel" it was a powerfully persuasive piece of propaganda, as it was intentioned by Leslie Howard.This movie has been sited by many well-known war heroes as being pivotal in their involvement in the war effort, and their personal choice to go above and beyond the call of duty. Sadly, it is also thought to have incited a plot to obliterate the source of such inspiration, Leslie Howard. It is supposed by some that Nazi Propaganda Minister Goebbels was so incensed by Leslie Howard's successful one-man propaganda campaign against the Nazis that he orchestrated the attack on the airplane that Howard was in. It is to this day, one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries."Why Did the Nazis Murder Leslie Howard?" is an interesting article by Clare Clovin that highlights the mystery the question of possible espionage. "In Search of My Father," the biography of Leslie's son Ronald Howard, covers a lot of interesting ground as well, and sensitively puts forth facts about Leslie's personal and professional life. It is a must-read for fans of Leslie and Ronald. If you've seen all of their films twice over, it's interesting to ponder what they were feeling and dealing with in their personal lives while trying to entertain the masses.

$review_text.: I cant even readily identify what genre this movie belongs to, because it fails on so many levels. The writing was so disjointed that it managed to spend 2 hours criss-crossing between sci-fi, spiritualism, numerology, and impending apocalypse without making any kind of coherent statement. At the end of the movie, I was left with a 'what did I just watch?' feeling. It starts simply enough with a numerological message scribbled by an odd young girl thats placed in a time capsule. Lo and behold when the capsule is opened, it ends up in the hands of an astrophysicist who readily deciphers it as containing a roadmap to dates, locations, and casualties related to all major disasters in the past 50 years with more to come.It tries unsuccessfully to establish that everything is ordained, that things are not random, and there's nothing we can do to prevent fate from unfolding. When aliens (yes, aliens) start gathering 'chosen' children to be evacuated from the impending apocalypse (rapidly approaching in the form of a massive solar flare) there's a sense of pointlessness. It's never explained why some are chosen or why aliens are even bothering to save them. Throw in a dose of spiritualism to confuse things even more, and you'll get a sense of the utter lack of direction in this mess.

$REVIEW.: I really did enjoy this movie and Charlize Theron can do ugly evil real good; she is one amazing talent. The movie has some great special effects and it brings you right into it, which I loved. Kristen Stewart is not strong in this movie which I was hoping she would be; she still needs to grow as an actor and stop playing herself in all these movies. I don't see the character I see her as herself, but beside that it was fun watching this movie. I don't like to give to much away, but I have to say Ian McShane, Toby Jones along with a few other greats lost a few inches for this movie. Enjoy, you'll be surprised, the movie was well done.

$review_text.: This jewel of a film ought to be seen by all who teach, learn, or wish they were doing either.Julie Walters turns in the Oscar-nominated performance of a lifetime as an Open University working-class student turning up at Michael Caine's (also Oscar nominated) Oxford rooms for tutoring in literature.The results are hilarious but - more important - deeply revealing of the pretensions on both sides of the class gap that separates these two stars of this low-budget 1983 production.Walters, whose 'Rita' imagines herself 'a little out of step' with the University thing, is gorgeous and versatile


Caine plays a latter-day drunk Socrates, who only knows one thing: 'I know that I know absolutely nothing'.He's wrong of course


 He knows more than that and he discovers some of it via's delightful invasion of his miserable life

But, like Socrates, he is wrong in the very best way and his methodological insight unclutters the poverty that allows him to become rich.EDUCATING RITA is one hundred eleven minutes of pure joy, a largely unremembered romantic comedy and more that may belong on your list of top ten movies.Watch it with your son or daughter who's heading off to university, lest he or she think too much of her teachers and too little of life.

$REVIEW.: A few years back, Ricky Gervais created "The Office," a Dilberty satire on office work. Now, he's created "Extras," a wickedly funny satire on showbiz and acting, both seasons of which are contained here. And the fact that prominent actors appear in it -- as warped versions of themselves -- is just the icing on the comedy cake.Andy Millman (Gervais) and Maggie Jacobs (Ashley Jenson) are film extras -- Andy is embittered by his lack of success and his inept agent (Stephen Merchant, Gervais' work partner), while well-meaning Maggie merely pursues a series of crew members on the films they work in.The first episode features the two working in a biopic directed by a brusque Ben Stiller ("Would you stop going on about your f**king dead wife?"), and Andy gets himself kicked off the set. Their blunders continue with other stars: Kate Winslet in a nun costume, who teaches Maggie how to talk dirty to her new boyfriend ("I'd love it if you stuck your Willy Wonka in between my Oompa-Loompas!"); Samuel L. Jackson, and Patrick Stewart, who is writing a movie about psychkinesis and naked women.And in the second season, Andy gets his Big Break -- BBC2 is producing his sitcom "When the Whistle Blows," but they dumb it down until it's popular but critically lambasted. Meanwhile, he and Maggie tangle with a bunch of new celebs -- the arrogant woman-chasing Daniel Radcliffe and Orlando Bloom, self-promoting Chris Martin, a hostile David Bowie, and Andy even stars in a play of Ian McKellen's about gay love (much to his discomfort).Finally, the Christmas special takes us forward -- Andy has fame and fortune from his sitcom, and Maggie is still struggling at the lowest rungs. When Andy blows up and destroys his own fame, he is forced to confront the fact that he cannot be both an "artiste" and rich'n'famous.... and also who his true friends will always be.It's a bit depressing compared to the past two seasons, especially when Andy has turned into a big stupid sitcom diva. But it is funny in an understated way, and Gervais' televised monologue is an absolute, heartbreaking gem.Part of the genius of "Extras" is that it isn't much like any other showbiz parodies -- the lead characters are on the lowest rung of acting, and the big egos are real stars making fun of themselves. Sometimes they play really nasty versions of themselves, such as Winslet saying that she's only making a Holocaust film so she can FINALLY nab an Oscar.The other half of the comic genius is Gervais' direction, with most of the jokes based on socially awkward situations. It's all about cringing and giggling at once, such as when Andy's pals see him pantsless in Ian McKellen's dressing room. Those hideously embarrassing situations -- usually with some hilarious dialogue involving the star guests (Bowie's "little fat man/nobody's laughing" song is a gutsplitter) are what it's all about.Gervais underplays a sort of befuddled, cynical extra, but you can really connect with his struggles, even when he gets his own sitcom. No matter what, Andy can always be depended on to jam foot in mouth, and occasionally to attack Warwick Davis. And Jensen is clumsily charming as Maggie, who tries to be nice to everyone but says all the wrong things at the wrong time, when she's not being pursued by Orlando Bloom or offending Samuel Jackson.From start to finish, "Extras" is an uproariously funny, barbed looks at the strange world of showbiz, with the self-parodying actors as the final perfect touch.

$review_text.: This is definatly the worst of the Lethal Weapon series but it is not at all a bad movie. If you read all of the one star reviews on this movie you have people complaining about the grea amount of action in this movie and how theres too much swearing. Who the hell are these wusses saying that! If you don't want swearing go watch a Jesus flick. The main problem with this film is that Mel seems to lost anything psyco about him with his mullet. Now hes going around like an old sane person which doesn't hold the same great image that we had seen from him in the first 3 films. Plus in this film I think they put alittle too much in for the ladies. Not a single guy really cares about Ruso getting knocked up. So the last few minutes of the film are alittle anoying. Other than that though its a very awsome movie.

$REVIEW.: Da vinci code couldn't quite live up to the publicity i guess.
not that it deserved any of it to begin with (goes to show how narrow-minded people are when they are so shocked by the slightest hint of change)..Yes it is an interesting thought that the church is sitting on top of some grandiose conspiracy - it probably is as a matter of fact (though i doubt it involves mary magdalene).

What we have here is something that is intriguing but it doesn't take us to that extra step - it isn't spellbinding (no where near in fact).
People say 'oh the book is so much better' - well I would certainly hope so.

$REVIEW.: Long before Harry Potter and somewhere during Indiana Jones' heyday there was this quiet entry, Young Sherlock Holmes
I remember it, the coming of age story of an inquisitive young man and the navet&eacute; of his friend as they investigate the mysteries that the adults around them ignored.This is an old movie, at that painful cusp when computer graphics had yet to touch mainstream movies and movie making was still trying to avoid dreaded R-ratings


There is no blood, guts, gore or dismemberment; there are not fast paced montages to pander to our ADD addled attention spans


What you have here is a rather innocent, if not hokey, look at a fun story of adolescent adventure

The actors have all since faded, their performances not particularly noteworthy however the plot, the story and the idea remain a comfortable look back into how such an iconic character may have been formed.But this movie, it's a bargain, it may not be something you watch more than a handful of times but you'll be glad you did

You'll see that one Harry Potter was not the first young boy to seek out adventure while the rest of us toiled in our busy lives.Fun!

I'd been a fan for a long time, but this performance really sealed the deal for me.When I saw the DVD available on Amazon I snatched it up


Watching it again, many years later - he's still just as impressive as he always was.RIP Michael Jackson

$REVIEW.: If you have a collection of original cast albums and have ever wondered what goes on the day the show is recorded this fascinating documentary tells it all.D A Pennebaker spent 18 hours with the cast, musicians and recording crew commiting the recording of the show to film.On May 3, 1970 they all convened on Columbia Records 30th Street Studios in New York. Elaine Stritch's recording &quot;The Ladies Who Lunch&quot; is a fascinating and frightening event.  It truly captures what a great talent Stritch is.There is commentary on the DVD that is quite interesting.  Additional footage is included along with the problems Dean Jones, the shows star, was having in his life.  Elaine Stritch has also supplied her recollections on that day 30 years ago.I highly recommend this.

$REVIEW.: When David Cronenberg first bursted on the scene with one of his first horror films, "Rabid" in 1977; he featured porn star Marilyn Chambers in the lead role.  Fast forward 20 years later and he seems to have come full circle with this bizzare release.  A couple who become involved with a group who stages famous crashes and become sexually aroused by the sheer thrill of it all.  The characters have a serious fetish problem.  At the end, I'm wondering "...why should I care about these people?"  The film is sick & perverted and not a pleasant film to watch.  Leave the kiddies at home!  Don't get this film confused with the 2005 Oscar winning drama!  It certainly doesn't deserve any awards!  Bypass this one!

It's about a 17 year old girl named Sara, who is a ballet dancer but then her Mom gets in a car reck at the beginning and she stops for awhile on her ballet dancing. Then she has to move to her Dad's town in Chicago. Well anyways, I don't wanna give out the whole movie! So I recommend you buy this VHS movie today!!

The protagonist writes books (children's books) and it is not clear whether or not the strange and disconnected events in the movie are her imaginings for a novel or if they actually occurred.  In this, the movie was unsatisfying.  What was a pleasure to see was Mexico City.  Never having been there, I would not imagine the way it was shown.  It was more like New York or Madrid than a third world metropolis.  Things like call forwarding and cell phones and answering machines are no different than what we have here at home.  But the plot of the movie, whatever that was, was not enough to save this film.  Perhaps the plot was not important . . I really couldn't figure that out.  See it and make up your own mind.

$review_text.: Visually impressive, this film captures the comic book elements of its source brilliantly
But as a tale of the Spartan stand against the Persians it is woefully unhistoric and overwrought


The Spartans are nearly all ferocious superheroes, not men at all in the ordinary sense, and they are all lovers of "freedom." They are "drawn" (perhaps visually enhanced is a better way of putting it) with muscles on top of muscles and they are courageous and dauntless to a man
Against them are ranged the inhuman monsters of the evil Persian king Xerxes, a man who stands twice the height of an ordinary man, is shaved from head to toe, prances about nearly naked, is covered with facial and body rings in the most decadent fashion imaginable and speaks with a deep, echoing resonance suggesting he is the devil himself.He appears on a giant throne, drawn by slaves who are, themselves, little more than inhuman monsters, and approaches the front line to parley with good King Leonidas, the noble Spartan
Never mind that there would have been little likelihood the Persian King of Kings would have driven to the battle's front lines on a giant mobile throne, or any other contraption, to face the Spartan king and thereby risk being killed by a Spartan surprise


Xerxes was, famously, the less than successful son of his predecessor, Darius, and typically traveled surrounded by his army
There is certainly no record that he was the sort to get out in front and, centuries later, when Alexander crushed the Persians, their king stayed well back from the front and only fled when Alexander broke through


The whole picture here of Xerxes is fantasy.No less unrealistic than Xerxes himself, his army, seems to have been imported from another planet
At one point a soldier atop a charging rhinoceros (what human has ever been able to harness and ride a rhino?) comes plowing into the Spartan phalanxe but not to worry, for the huge beast is downed by a single well thrown Spartan spear

Ah, those Spartans!Xerxes' Immortals (his personal guard) and his other minions are portrayed throughout as distorted, corrupted beings, disfigured creatures we can easily imagine slaughtering in battle without pity since they aren't really human like our heroic Spartans, who live and die and eat and breathe and laugh and grieve -- just like us (or as we imagine ourselves doing)


Indeed, we are given little of the Spartans' own cruel culture here or, in their constant talk of "freedom," any revelation concerning the Helots -- Greek slaves who lived under their cruel thumb, did their bidding and were routinely sacrificed on the altar of Spartan brutality (a highly practiced strategy intended to strike fear into the Helots and make them permanently submissive to their Spartan masters).This film is all "glory" and bloody battle, killing and getting killed


And, while the Spartans are noble and heroic, the villains are utterly bad, including the Spartan elders or ephors, portrayed here as vile, barely human monsters living apart from other Spartans in a mystical sanctuary atop a mountain where they sexually enslave beautiful young Spartan females! Or King Leonidas' rival who rapes the good king's wife while Leonidas is off at war saving Greece from the monstrous Persians


No mention here, either, of the Spartan practice of dual kingship
Leonidas, of course, is only one of two Spartan kings but you don't get any sense of that from this film, either.I suppose "300" accurately portrays the comic book or "graphic novel" it was based on (at least it seems to do this visually) and that is an accomplishment of sorts


But I'd rather have seen Pressfield'sGates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of Thermopylae, itself a somewhat unseemly glorification of the Spartans, in film form than this cartoon-like rendering of these famous events

And for a more realistic view of the Spartans, themselves, one would be even better off going to Nicholas Nicastro'sThe Isle of Stone: A Novel of Ancient Sparta, about the Spartan defeat by the Athenians in the famous battle of Sphacteria in the Pelopennesian War which followed the Greek defeat of Xerxes at Plataea, after the Hot Gates
(The Spartans actually ended up winning the Pelopennesian War, of course, and imposed a brief tyranny on the Athenians who ultimately managed to break free and, in alliance with other Greek City states, finally defeated the Spartans and broke their grip on the land mass of Greece

Sparta's great weakness was its elitism which kept the conquered Helots down as slaves rather than absorbing them into the nation and growing stronger from the addition of other peoples.)Xerxes, himself, by the way, was only a man and not an especially terrifying one at that, if the historical record is to be believed


He certainly wasn't the dread, devil incarnate this film hands us

For another view of the mighty Xerxes, you can read L

Sprague de Camp'sThe Dragon of the Ishtar Gate, a really enjoyable adventure tale set in Xerxes' time which is probably truer to its era and characters -- though it is somewhat tongue-in-cheek (but more fun, for that).Now that would make a hell of a movie.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga

$REVIEW.: I'll be the first to admit that I don't really get this style of humor.  This is because, from where I'm standing, the humor comes in the way of being so darn cute and adorable, that it basically gives me the impression I'm too old and mature to find any interesting qualities with the jokes.  In other words, this is teenage humor for those who think relationship humor actually has redeeming features.She's Out of My League features entirely unfunny characterization by every single person starring in the film.Jay Baruchel plays the part of a nerdy guy working at an airport.  He's in desperate need of a relationship with a woman.  He gets his big chance (eventually) and then the story kicks in and then... it just becomes a big unfunny, pointless and typical "boy meets girl/boy falls in love with girl" romance comedy from this point forward.  No humor anywhere in sight, I'm afraid.Only the one female friend of Alice Eve's character was funny, and that's only because she was extremely belligerent to everyone, including complete strangers on airplanes.Again, I found no humor anywhere so I didn't enjoy She's Out of My League.  None of Jay Baruchel's friends made me laugh either.  In fact they felt really tacked on and completely pointless except for in a few key moments of storytelling.Again, perhaps I'm just too old to appreciate this kind of humor, but then again, I didn't like it 10 years ago either.  It's like watching American Pie with all the humor sucked out of it.

$REVIEW.: Viewing Equipment: Epson 3010 3D PJ on a 92" DaLite Screen. Given the wide variety of reviews related to the PQ I was a little nervous about picking this one up. Grosse Point Blank is an all-time favorite film of mine and holds up extremely well on repeat viewings.I actually saw this in theatres when it first came out. Since I also view films on a very large format screen, nothing gets by me very easy. I had an opportunity to view this over the holidays on a family members 106" DaLite screen opposed to my usual 92". I must say the PQ was very good! I felt like I was watching a print; not video. I couldn't disagree more with any negative reviews of the PQ. I respect the opinions, but it certainly wasn't the experience I had thankfully. I sat about 15 feet back from the 106" screen. I noticed a few specks and scratches here and there, but nothing too egregious. I did notice some light ringing in scene or two. The only reason I caught that was because I was scrutinizing it very closely given some of the very harsh reviews I have read related to the PQ. The other thing that I find amusing is the fact that the DVD release of this film is non-anamorphic! You can't even seriously compare the DVD to the BD release of this film! LOL! The BD blows it away! I threw in the DVD first and watched it for awhile to see if I would notice a difference and when I put the BD in there was no comparison. I have seen some crappy BD's, but this isn't one of them. Batman Begins comes to mind. The PQ on that BD was very disappointing in many scenes. I think people tend to unfairly compare stuff shot recently on HD digital cameras and forget what film looks like.Fans of this film can purchase with confidence. The PQ is a solid 4 out of 5 stars.

$review_text.: I just took a look at Road Trip, comedy from way back in 2000. I bought it because it came with a free ticket to see The Hangover Part III and I had a passing interest in seeing it. I am now starting to regret that decision, twofold.The plot is fairly straightforward, with no real surprises in terms of the narrative, but the premise offers plenty of opportunities for funny scenes and characters. Road Trip, unfortunately, misses most of those opportunities. This film was clearly meant to be in the same vein as American Pie, a raunchy college comedy, but it doesn't quite reach that level, nor that of something like Animal House.Like I said, the plot isn't too complicated. College slacker Josh Parker (Breckin Meyer) has a girlfriend named Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), his childhood sweetheart, but they attend different colleges, with Josh at the fictional University of Ithaca in New York State and Tiffany at the University of Austin, Texas. He has a tryst with classmate Beth (Amy Smart), which she lets him videotape. Said tape is accidentally mailed to Tiffany as part of Josh's ritual of him sending her video journals, or something like that. Now Josh and his buddies have three days to drive from New York to Texas to intercept the tape before Tiffany sees it. It's pretty straightforward, no real problems plot or narrative wise, with one glaring exception. The plot is set in a frame story, a set of flashbacks narrated by Tom Green's character, which I'll go into detail with later. This framing device is pointless. If taken out, there is no loss to the plot. In fact, he could've just as easily been narrated by Meyer's character.During this trip, there are a decent variety of scenes and environments given the road path that the friends take. The cinematography is decent, but nothing special. The soundtrack is typical of the late 1990s early 2000s era, mostly mellow college rock; again, nothing to write home about. The shenanigans that the characters get into, typical of this "crazy adventure" type story, are hit and miss, mostly miss. Thankfully though, a lot of the unfunny jokes don't last very long, and are typically scene-enders. The gross-out type comedy that is prevalent in this genre is kept to a minimum without any real loss of the comedy, or this case, lack thereof. The fan-service scenes are gratuitous, of course, but that's the point in this genre; they serve their purpose. The dialogue between the characters is a natural and believable, given the characters and the situations that they find themselves in; most of it isn't pointless, but there are some hiccups.The acting and the characters are really were this film drops the ball. It's hard to remember, but these actors seem a little bit too old for college kids, even for back then, but for suspension-of-disbelief's sake, I'm willing to forgive that. First of all, not everything is bad. Amy Smart is nice and likable, the girl-next-door type. She does okay, with a good and believable mix of strength and vulnerability. DJ Qualls as Kyle is squirrelly and vulnerable, but not wholly feeble. His friends do take advantage of him, but it all does seem to be in good fun, and he takes it in stride well enough. He is the "pathetic loser" type typical of teen films, not unlike Cameron from Ferris Bueller's Day Off (played by Alan Ruck), right down to the overly strict father. Unlike Cameron, Kyle does eventually confront his father directly, rather than it being implied, and although this particular plotline's resolution is not terrible, it's not particularly satisfying either. Breckin Meyer is barely passable. He almost delves into blandness, but not quite enough to destroy the performance, but he does straddle that line a little too closely for my taste. Paulo Costanzo as Rubin is boring, emotionless, and uninteresting; if he obviously doesn't care about what's going on around him, why should we? He's the stoner/slacker stereotype, and he doesn't diverge from that trope at all, and much of the plot can take place without him without any real loss. Sean William Scott plays . . . somebody. I forget the actual character name, but let's face it, he's just playing Stifler from the American Pie films again. Seriously, the character is no different, essentially a copy-and-paste with no discernible changes whatsoever. But I suppose that is the point, as Sean William Scott was typecast for that character type. If you found Stiffler funny, you'll find Stifler 2.0 funny in this film too. Anthony Rapp's character of Jacob is a stock psycho/stalker type; he's clich&eacute;d and lame, and only serves to poorly fill the "bully" stereotype, but he doesn't really look the part. There are some funny cameos, however. Horatio Sanz, from Saturday Night Live fame, has one of the few really funny parts in this film. It's of the gross-out variety, but not too bad and hilarious nonetheless. Jimmy Kimmel also has a cameo that's pretty funny; see if you can catch it. There's also a brief appearance by John Ross Bowie, whom you probably know as Barry Kripke of The Big Bang Theory fame. Of course, Andy Dick is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise good cameo list. But all of this, good and bad, is nothing compared to the true horror of this film, the un-equally terrible Tom Green.Tom Green is abysmal in this film; by far, he is the worst thing about it. He is annoying and unfunny. For the life of me, I cannot remember or understand why we as a nation ever found him funny, and frankly, I'm ashamed of it. Like I said before, he's the narrator for the frame story, but I already went over how pointless that was. In fact every scene he's in is pointless and goes nowhere. Not one bit of it is funny, just annoying and obnoxious. Everything about this character is painful. His name is Barry Manilow, something that I believe that the real Barry Manilow regrets immensely. Tom Green's scenes are painful in every sense of the word to watch. The only good one is where the snake tries to eat him, and man, do I wish it did, but then again, Tom Green is nearly impossible to stomach.The ending, which I won't give away here, is kind of anti-climactic, in the sense that it just sort of happens without any real tension or build-up. I will give the film credit for this though: the way the situation resolves is unconventional and unexpected, and even grown-up in its own way. The standard epilogue for this type of film, that being the "what happened to them afterward" footnotes are uninteresting for all the characters, and don't do any of them any real justice, what little there was to be done.The DVD extras are standard, mostly trailers. The trailer itself is mostly more Tom Green, so it's just annoying. He also hosts the making-of documentary, so that's also worthless. The deleted scenes were left out for reason, as they are even less funny than what made it into the film, and many of them are just mean-spirited. Skipping the DVD extras will most likely do you more good than otherwise.Overall, this film is boring, forgettable, and only slightly funny in some rare parts. That being said, it's not outright terrible, but it comes darn close, almost too close for comfort. There could've been some genuine comedy here, but the opportunity is mostly missed out on. Unless you're really a fan of just this genre of raunchy college comedy films, you're better off passing on it.
$SUMMARY.: Don't make a pit stop for this film. Just pass it on the right.

$REVIEW.: This is a unique minimalist tale, more atmosphere than action, about America seen through the eyes of a winsome young Hungarian woman (Eszter Balint) who comes to stay with her deadbeat cousin (John Lurie) in a desolate area of New York City before moving on to an equally desolate Cleveland suburb
The pretty exile from then-Communist Eastern Europe finds a New World that is not the Promised Land of capitalism, but a vacant landscape of low-rent neighborhoods, motels, hot dog restaurants, bus stations, lonely highways, and TV dinners

The three young people in this film might be lost souls on an aimless road trip, but this is an America where there is no place to arrive
As one character observes, all places are the same
But the bleakness of the landscape is relieved by touches of warmth and gentle humor

The minimalist style and moody music fit the story well


Short individual scenes like snapshots are separated by a black screen

The silences in the conversation and the atmospheric noises become as important as what the characters say

"Stranger than Paradise" succeeds in being artful without being pretentious.When this film appeared in 1984 it was well received in Europe but did not get much play in the U.S


outside the art house circuit
Now, more than twenty years later, it still holds up very well


In later films Jim Jarmusch has further explored America as seen by the stranger/foreigner ("Down by Law," "Mystery Train"), but without achieving the same magic

If you are receptive to that magic, you may find yourself quoting the characters of "Stranger than Paradise" or fondly recalling their humorous foibles.

$review_text.: This is another wreck of Indian ways and culture told by Hollywood story tellers, who had no idea what an Indian really was


If you look at the fact that Sioux Indians were in the North West, then why did his companion, who spoke French, was the way of Indians in the lower East of America.Besides that, why did Harris's character, who after living with the Indians for so long, never bothered to even learn their language
At one point, he is teaching his new wife english...how sad
But, that's Hollywood, and this is an exploitation Hollywood-style, of the true and authentic Indian Cultures.Terrible acting, sound and editing, stay away from this one

You'll be glad you did.


$SUMMARY.: If you're into factual Indian Culture, stay away.

$review_text.: Well, well, well, Spielberg has finally broke down and started to release movies on dvd...i was quite suprised to see this film available in the format, PLEASENTLY suprised.  I must say that the Jaws collector's editon  dvd is far superior to any other format available for this film.  The sound  quality is pleasing, but not the greatest, but when you've listened to the  film in mono for seven years, it seems quite refreshing. New sound effects  have been added in, but not to worry, the entire thing was done under  Spielberg's suprivision.  The very begining in which the pulsating theme is  first heard fills the entire sound field...a nice surprise.  And the sound  is directional often passing from right, center, to left.  Bass is toned  down a bit, but it actually sounds better this way.  The bass seems to have  more of a role whenever a victim is takin, and also durring william's  pulsating theme.  Picture quality is fine.  Most notable are the sound fx  for when the shark is finally detonated, and the rapid gun fire which  triggers it to do so.  Bass is greatly emphasized here.  great picture,  great sound, for a film thats 25 years old.  Cool extras too.  The  documentary is much longer than i expected.  The game is fun too.  a MUST  HAVE.

Granted, there were a few funny moments (eg. Merman) but this film is really aimed at people who have the lowest IQ.  Ben Stiller acts the same in all his films, so it was no surprise to me to find that he acted the same in Zoolander.  Same facial expressions etc etc.I think I'll stick to films where actors work hard at their craft.

$review_text.: The Golden Girls had a marvelous seven year run (1985-92), but for my money you will find no better episodes than the ones on the set for season one. The pilot episode was absolutely hysterical, I can't recall off the top of my head rolling on the floor so much during a single episode from Sophia's entrance "Everyone's fine, no one died, the home burned down to telling Blanche that she looked like a prostitute. It was set up really nicely Dorothy as the hard nosed substitute teacher "Well I expressed myself, I told them they were too ugly to look at." To Rose and Dorothy's discussion of animals that move.Other classic episodes include The Break In where the Girls are robbed prompting Rose's fear of killers, which leads to all kinds of hysterical gags from Blanche macing herself, to Rose buying a gun and shooting a Chinese vase to Dorothy declaring to a unscrupulous security system salesman to get out before the victim of violent crime in this house is him. Other standout episodes include Blanche's grandson where the problems Blanche has with her children are brought into focus. Overall though, the first season of Golden Girls produces monster laughs with some of the best written episodes of the entire series and sets the stage for the coming greatness.

$REVIEW.: The heart of this Veggie Tales movie is the telling of the story of Jonah
 While Jonah is inevitably associated with the "whale" (actually "great fish", from the Hebrew "Dag Gadol"), there's a lot more to his story than that


 The story is set out with delight and with humor.One problem the filmmakers had to work around is that they did not want to make God (who has a fair amount to say in the Biblical book) a character in this movie

 They get around this quite well by putting His words in the mouths of other characters
 This does lead to a slight weakness near the end (Chapter 4 of the Biblical book) which, in the Bible, is heavily devoted to conversation between deity and prophet, and leads to the lesson in compassion which concludes the story


 There is simply no way to reproduce God's unanswerable statement which concludes the book; the moviemakers settle for spelling out the lesson in compassion.Reasonably faithful to the Bible, there are some delightful moments--as when the sailors cast lots to see which among them has offended his god--the lot falls upon Jonah through playing a dramatic game of Go Fish!  And, as Jonah floats in the water and the sailors try to rescue him, the moviemakers show great sense of humor and cinematography, as tension-filled music is heard, and a wide shot is maintained--showing plenty of ocean shortly to be filled by Jonah's swallower.There is a slight Christian emphasis (mostly through the repetition of the "God of the Second Chance" and "mercy" themes, which, as it is not overt, should not present a problem for those of other faiths.Kids and adults should enjoy a good story here, and the latter should admire the techniques used to tell it!Well recommended.

$REVIEW.: Urban Legend was just one of the many teen imitators that splashed across the screen in the wake of the enormously successful "Scream". It is one of those films riding on the coattails of "Scream". It's one of the few that succeeds. So, what is this latest entry in teen terror all about?. In all actuality, this isn't a bad film, and it's idea is quite fun and interesting. The film is set at Pendleton college, which I believe is set somewhere in New England. A group of students are being stalked by a murderous psychopath who wears a giant parka(oooh!! scary!!), and kills people by way of re-enacting urban legends. It's actually a fun idea for a little, innocent teen thriller, and the idea is handled pretty well in this film. Some of the urban legends represented in the film are quite well known, while others I, and others I would presume, have probably never heard of. Urban Legend is a great looking film. The cinematography and direction is superb. It has a great, colorful look to it. The cast, while nothing great, was fine. Alicia Witt, as heroine Natalie, isn't a convincing Scream Queen, but she tries her best. She isn't even the typical heroine looking type. The real standout was Loretta Devine as Security Guard Reese. She was really good. Other faces here include "Dawson's Creek" star Joshua Jackson, sporting a blonde goatee and hair, Tara Reid, Jared Leto, who is now simply known as Cameron Diaz's ex, veteran horror actor Brad Douriff, "Baron Munchausen" himself John Neville, Natasha Gregson Wagner(who appears in the film's fun opening teaser), future "Smallville" star, Michael Rosenbaum, and Danielle Harris, who fright fans will know as little Jamie Lloyd in "Halloween 4" and the inferior, "Halloween 5". She has definitley grown up. It's always a great pleasure to see one of the kings of horror, Robert Englund. His appearence as a professor, was much appreciated, but, sadly, way too short. The film has some solid scares and suspense. I was pleasantly surprised. While there were disappointing parts of the film that seemed too much of a "Scream" rip-off, the film is mostly it's own thing. It's a fun, quiet little film. Urban Legend is a guilty pleasure that definitley entertains. Give it a chance. Skip the sequel.

$review_text.: Chances are that if you are in tune with the horror genre (and even if you aren't) you have heard something about Teeth.  Jess Weixler stars as Dawn, an abstinance preaching high school student who gets a huge surprise when she discovers she has quite the physical advantage when she becomes the object of male sexual violence.  You can figure out what this advantage is just from reading the film's synopsis, which is basically the ultimate form of female empowerment.  Had the genders been reversed in some way, Teeth would be pure exploitation all the way, but instead, Teeth is an often gripping (and somewhat cheesey), and nearly unforgettable, tale of revenge.  The only real flaws with Teeth is that a majority of the situations Dawn finds herself in, namely getting forced against her will, come off as unrealistic.  However, the film is really an amalgamation of female empowerment, exploitation, cautionary tale, and plain horror; yet it never feels like it, or feel generic for that matter either.  Weixler is quite good in the leading role, as is Nip/Tuck's John Hensley as Dawn's sadistic half brother who you just know is going to get what he deserves.  All in all, Teeth is definitely worth a look, but be forewarned fellow men, if you are of the faint of heart, well, do proceed with caution.

I never thought that it would be done
It's all here, the three seasons, plus the specials, and the animated adventures

A great set for anyone who enjoyed watching David Tennant as the Doctor.My problem, as with most folks, was the packaging

It's beautiful

The book binding is a great collector item, however, it's not practical

I was glad that I read those reviews from folks who got their copies first
I took great care to get each disc out slowly

A couple of them had scratches, but I tested to make sure that at least the episodes played in some

The only one that doesn't play all the way is Doctor Who Animated: The Infinite Quest


The worst thing is that it stops with about a minute and half left in the movie! I am keeping the set anyway, as I don't want to have to go through opening up the set carefully again


Plus, Infinite Quest can be had for a cheap price.

$REVIEW.: Wow, what can be said that hasn't already been said? This show was wonderfully entertaining fifteen years ago, and it still holds up. Looking back on it, the removal of the original music gives it the benefit of not dating itself to the late '90s, as the general ideas of being an outsider that's okay with being an outside is timeless. They kept the original theme song (easily the most identifiable song of the entire show) and while I don't remember if this was the original song at the end of season four, it certainly fit with the events that transpired.The creators of the show do not treat the audience as idiots, which is ironic given Daria's humble beginnings in "Beavis and Butthead" and the sharp nosedive of MTV programming shortly after "Daria"'s cancellation. Everyone gets called out for pretentiousness and shallowness and self-deluded BS, including Daria herself. It's also never glossed over that she does things to isolate herself from others and that she's not an innocent victim of the cruel high school life--in fact, this is the only example of teen fare in the '90s that doesn't have an antagonist.Overall, a worthwhile addition to any collection.

$REVIEW.: Lame is the first word that came to mind as I was watching this all-star World War II morale booster.  I really wanted to like it a lot more than I did, but the plot's framing device killed it for me.  Robert Hutton plays a soldier on leave who visits the Hollywood Canteen with one hope ... to get a kiss from Joan Leslie, that All-American girl next door.  He does, and a phony romance develops between them that pretty much ruins the film.  It's oh-so-sweet and innocent and trite.  Fortunately, there are some good moments that don't feature the wholesome couple.  The film is populated by the best talent at Warner Brothers, mostly playing themselves.  Dane Clark doesn't play Dane Clark, but instead Hutton's army buddy, and he supplies the film's humour as he tries to win over Ida Lupino, Alexis Smith, Joan Crawford, and Janis Paige.  Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre have a short but terrific scene together where they use their sinister screen personas to great effect.  There are some good musical numbers performed, along with other appearances by such classic stars as Jane Wyman, Barbara Stanwyck, Jack Carson, Dennis Morgan, Joe E. Brown, and the Hollywood Canteen's founders, Bette Davis and John Garfield.  So although I did enjoy seeing so many great actors from yesteryear out of character for a change, I just wish that screenwriter and director Delmer Daves had come up with a better framing device to move the film along.  Sixty years later it doesn't stand up very well, and I can't imagine that audiences back then really bought into it either.

$review_text.: Why, why, why??? Why not use the plot from the short story in the movie?? Spielberg was "keeping it real"....real dumb. I guess we were not supposed to miss the original theme and plot of the book due to all the neat special effects. And the ending? Typical Spielberg - don't believe all the "dark atmosphere" hype, its a joke.Read the Philip K. Dick short story instead.
$SUMMARY.: GREAT....If you never read the original story.

$REVIEW.: This movie sucked big time.  Sorry, that's not very literary writing for a movie review, but it is the truth.  I thought this movie would take itself a little more seriously...even Jack the Giant Slayer is more watchable than this - ditto any of the recent Snow White movies, or the Red Riding Hood movie.  But this?  It's nothing more than a violent video game with cheesy action hero one-liners tossed in!Okay, calm down. First of all, the plot:  Hansel and Gretel have a bad "witch experience" as children (as we all know, it's how the story goes...)so during their adult lives, they decide to embark on revenge on all witches.  Basically, that's it.  There's a tiny bit more, but I won't be a spoiler - not that it matters anyway, since you should not go anywhere near this movie to begin with!There is basically ZERO character development in this version of the story - there is no interesting back story involving any of the witches - just 2 leather clad cool hip vigilante witch hunters who swear an awful lot for mideival times, along with toting huge assault rifles - not very interesting weaponry for a supposedly magical era, right?This movie is such a bad clich&eacute;!  The funny thing is, I don't believe it was supposed to actually be a spoof!  There is even the sexy "good witch" thrown in for the guys to drool over, along with the requisite view of her naked (oh please!  All women are groaning inwardly over this part).Violence and objectification of women, anyone?  If that's your cup of tea.  Lots of innocent women were burned at the stake during the infamous witch hunts....oh forget it. I guess nobody cares about that.  How uncool of me to bring it up!This movie is mostly blood and violence for the sake of showing blood and violence (think "D'Jango, with witches").  Some people say the visuals are great.  Well, I guess they are...unfortunately, good visuals don't make up for weak uninspired writing.No matter what you do, Do NOT let your children see this movie!!!  It just may scar them for life.  What happened to making just a nice interesting movie where you actually get to know the main characters, and maybe even (gasp!) like them?  These 2 main characters are not likable at all.  They are only 2-dimensional cartoon characters who you could care less about.I guess I have expressed myself enough here.  I do NOT recommend this movie - not even for a PPV...not even if someone hands it to you for free - or pays YOU to watch it.  Walk...no RUN in the opposite direction!

$review_text.: "November" is a mystery/suspense in which the structure of the film, itself, provides the mystery behind the traumatic memories of Los Angeles photographer Sophie Jacobs (Courteney Cox). Sophie's live-in boyfriend Hugh (James LeGros) was shot to death in a convenience store robbery. Now Sophie is having debilitating headaches and seeing a psychiatrist (Nora Dunn), who believes her symptoms may be the result of guilt. But Sophie seems to be doing things she doesn't remember, seeing things that don't make sense, and when a photo taken of the convenience store the night of the robbery turns up, Sophie's confusion deepens and the line between imagination and reality is blurred."November" moves slowly and is sporadically non-narrative. It's a circular, inscrutable account of the tricks that memory play on Sophie in the aftermath of some trauma....or perhaps no trauma. The film's strength is that it draws the audience into the mystery of Sophie's memory with flashbacks of the shooting throughout, giving the impression that there is something more to know which may be revealed if we follow the film's disjointed progression. "November" has 2 big strikes against it, though. One is that it is like a jigsaw puzzle with too many pieces. It doesn't add up. Director Greg Harrison has erroneously called this "ambiguity". That would imply that "November" can be interpreted more than one way. I challenge anyone to interpret it at all. Harrison does not have a clear idea of what he wants to say, so, ultimately, it doesn't come across.The second strike against "November" is the way it looks. This film was shot in 15 days on Mini DV, and it looks even worse than that implies.  It doesn't help that most of the film was shot in low light. It's very grainy. The lighting is multicolored, but primarily deathly tungsten blue or sickly fluorescent green. That's intentional. Add to this cheap, jarring visual effects, and "November" is practically unwatchable. I've been hearing for years how DV would revolutionize independent film by making it affordable for anyone to be a filmmaker. Well, I've seen a handful low-budget DV films in the past year, and I don't think I can take many more films that look this bad. I'm sure some of these filmmakers see themselves as innovative or avant-garde, but there is nothing in the world more conventional or commonplace than ugliness.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2005): There is an "Alternate Opening Sequence" (3 min), with commentary, that is not as good as the credit sequence that made the final cut. In "A Conversation with Lew Baldwin, composer/visual effects" (9 min), director Greg Harrison and Baldwin talk about creating the first sequence in the convenience store. "Photo Galleries" includes slide shows of 3 galleries: New York photographer Michele Asselin provides the photos that make up Sophie (3 min) and Jesse's (1 min) portfolios, which we see hanging on the walls in the movie. There are also behind-the-scenes photos (1 min). There are 2 audio commentary tracks: The first is by director Greg Harrison and screenwriter Benjamin Brand. They discuss the narrative structure of the film and compare the film to the script. The second commentary is by director Greg Harrison and cinematographer Nancy Schreiber. They talk about the film's colors, in-camera effects, lighting set-ups, and a lot about filming. Subtitles for the film are available in French.

$REVIEW.: In Glenview, Ohio there is a Costco run by a repressed manager, and are you surprised that this uptight guy is played by Ben Stiller? Ever the square, Evan (Stiller) founded the running club and the Spanish table at the community center. He and his wife are desperate to have kids. Evan doesn't have any friends. He's that kind of guy.When the Costco night security guard meets an untimely (and pretty gruesome) death, Evan decides to establish a neighborhood watch, ideally composed of concerned citizens tasked with solving the murder of security guard Antonio Guzman and "to generally get to the bottom of things."What Evan gets aren't civic-minded gents as much as a bunch of yahoos looking to get out of the house and hang out with the boys. Bob (Vince Vaughn) is that loud, obnoxious neighbor you love to hate. Jamarcus (Richard Ayoade), shy and recently divorced, is looking for action (and, by action, I mean Asian women). Franklin (Jonah Hill), once an aspiring law enforcer, sees the group as a vigilante squad. This is maybe the most unprepared, most undedicated neighborhood watch ever. And in Glenview, Ohio, they may be all that stand between us and an alien invasion. We are so, so screwed. This is how Falling Skies and After Earth happen.So, a disclaimer: THE WATCH is more clown house than art house. It isn't something you want to watch in the tea parlor with your aunties and your scones. It's not for delicate ears. This movie is raunchy and crude and vulgar. It's best enjoyed when you put on your frat-boy hat and you've got your immature buddies around. At least the trailer prepped you for what sort of movie it is. I did appreciate that the story didn't minimize the danger of the invaders. These aliens aren't that well established but we note that they're wicked mean and pursue a habit of skinning their victims. The green goo is, of course, an expected by-product. The humor is a cross between Apatow and the Farrelly Brothers. I couldn't believe the crazy things these guys were saying and doing, but, with me, it was a case of shaking my head but laughing, too. The performances, what performances? While I laughed a lot, I couldn't help but view the members of the Watch as shallow cartoon characters. Stiller, Vaughn, and Hill tap into their trademark onscreen personas, so either you like their patented traits or you don't. Either you like Costco or you don't. Either you like exploding cows or you don't.The DVD's bonus stuff:- 12 Deleted/Extended Scenes (totaling 00:24:35 minutes)- Gag Reel (00:03:41)- "Alien Invasions & You" - cast & crew are asked what they would do if there's an alien invasion (00:01:47)- "Casting the Alien" - a tongue-in-cheek sit down interview with one of the aliens (00:05:24)- Theatrical Trailer

$REVIEW.: Had no expectations even after seeing glowing reviews here, so when the credits rolled I wasn't disappointed in how bad it really was.The story follows two guys: one perv liquor store clerk and one straight laced fiance, as they are transported to an alternative porn world via a special porn flick booth. There are of course tons of beautiful, scantily clad ladies in this world that lead a life of washing cars in bikinis and eating whipped cream off each other. Apparently, our two characters are destined to learn about themselves in this world in order to get back to theirs. Along the way we see lots of ladies sans clothing doing all the stereotypical dumb things one would rent a B-movie skinemax film for.The supplements contain eight interviews of cast and crew, each lasting less than a few minutes. I honestly have to say the gals interviewed much better than the guys - especially Ms. Specter and Ms. Soto. The naked commentary is a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader with a bad chest enhancement job spouting a few interesting things about the cast and filming, she pops up every few minutes throughout. Caan is a way better actor than this but admittedly after seeing his bad interview (supplement) - then portray an over the top porn actor named Rod Cannon perfectly, I see he has a solid talent (hidden at times but still there).The video quality is good, the 5.1 is decent but really only gets used during Tracy Morgan's night club scene (music and dancing). Not that horrible, but not worthy of a recommendation either. If you are wanting to see the lead ladies disrobed it does not happen - nor with Caan but props to the props department for his "endowment".

$review_text.: There's a time out of mind feeling in "Darjeeling Limited" that makes me think it could just as easily have taken place in the 60's
If Francis (Owen Wilson) hadn't kept looking for a power cord, I would have been flashing back to the time when the Kinks' music from the soundtrack was original.The story's about three brothers: Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody), and Jack (Jason Schwartzman)
Francis originally tells his two younger sibs they're going on a spiritual journey after their father's death
His real motive is to find their mother (Anjelica Huston), who's gone off to an Indian convent instead of attending their father's funeral.Unfortunately, the brothers are not only not bonding--they're driving the conductor crazy til they get kicked off


 They do manage to pull things together to help some locals and in so doing, experience the revival they'd needed

 From there, they travel to see their Mom.Even if the brothers are occasionally depressing, the scenery, music, and train are well worth watching "Darjeeling Limited" for

 This is definitely a spiritual journey even for those of us watching in the audience.

$REVIEW.: Wow!  This is a hard review to write and it took me some time to come to grips.  But, I have to say that this release left me feeling unsatisfied.  As stated elsewhere, this DVD is missing 8 tracks from the R30.  Unfortunately for me, several of the cuts rank among my favorites.  What is left though is pretty good.  I actually got goosebumps watching Force 10.  Ditto for Red Barchetta.  But the sound glitches in Roll the Bones just grate me.I went to four of these shows and every single one of them was better than the last.  When you compare the live event w/this DVD it leaves you feeling empty.  There are no outright jams due to the missing instrumentals-big mistake.  Likewise, the editing of 2112 into Xanadu is just plain wrong.  In real life, La Villa and the awesome Bytor come between the two.As a result, the concert feels awful short.  It is not as epic as Rush in Rio.  Funny, when I first listened to RiR, I did not like the crowd noise.  But now, I miss them as the Frankfurt crowd seems bored.This is after all a 30th anniversary commemorative and nothing should be cut from the performance.  Now, the second disc is just pure joy.  The archive footage was very interesting especially the JUNO awards.I am a big Rush fan and I have been to some 45+ concerts.  I say this to say I am no Rush basher.  I am just surprised that Rush released this kind of product in this day and age.  In the old days, when VHS, vinyl, and 8-tracks ruled; bands were bound by time and spice.  Now-well you know.  They have proven that they can get it right (in terms of completeness) with RiR.Anyway, buy with caution.  The performances are great but the show feels edited (because it is) and therefore incomplete.  As for me RiR will remain the definitve live Rush concert.

$REVIEW.: I was sooo glad to see this action/comedy/sci-fi on dvd.  I havn't seen it since I was a tot, so I didn't remeber most of the gags.It's about a man named Shep Ramsey who is a humaniod and hates earthlings.  His ship crahses on earth, so he takes a vavcation.  Soon, he moves in with a man played by Christopher Lloyd who is extremly smart, but gets pushed around by his boss, his neighbors, an old lady in a sports car, and anyone he meets.  So, Shep moves in and then bounty hunters come and take over the world.  Or try to.  Shep and (Christopher Lloyd's charecter name here) stop them and the earth is svaed.This movie is hilarious, awesome and cool.  The action is non-stop all the way from beginning to end.  The sci-fi speical effects ,well, hey cut them a break, for 1991 they were soooo cool.  And constant expolsions.  And the comedy is hilarious.  My favorite gag was the car alarm gag.Car alarm: step away from the vechile(Shep rips out the car alarm)car Alarm: No, just kidding.  No really stand as close as you want.  No, take it, I'll tell you how(Shep squishes it.)Overall I highly recommend this movie foir anyone with a sense of humour.

$REVIEW.: I stumbled across this release while looking through some VoD listings.  Why did they have to go and butcher GiTS by adding in CGI? Horrible....Just from watching the preview I just had to shake my head in disgust for what they did.

$review_text.: I bought this DVD a while back and didn't think much of it because it had so much verbal instruction during the practice. I then realized there is an alternate practice mode that uses less verbal instruction once you've learned the routine and/or know a bit about yoga already. You can easily switch from one mode to another if you have an audio button on your DVD controller. If you're new to yoga this would be a great instructional video. I use the version with just the queues, it's great!It has some lovely, relaxing music and Dr. Bell's voice is very soothing and relaxing. The whole practice is very restorative and refreshing.Also, there is a cool yoga timer built into the practice. You need to have a top menu button on your DVD controller and when you press it you can hold a pose for 2, 5, or 10 minutes and then the practice continues. If you practice Yin Yoga this is a great option! You can go very deep into the postures.There are two practices, each run 35 minutes. You can do either one separate or together. Stress prevention is a bit more active and stress relief practice is very restorative & relaxing. He uses props like blocks, bolsters, and straps, but you could get away with not using those items.The stress prevention workout starts with a slow meditative sun salutation series, then on to warrior, tree, wide leg forward bend with a twist, cobbler, boat, seated twists, bridge, and more. What makes this practice different than other DVDs is he holds the poses for a long enough time that you feel it. It might be considered too slow moving if you like fast moving power yoga. There is time in between postures to settle in and feel your body. There is also a froggie version of downward facing dog that my bull dog and I really enjoyed, ribbit ;o)There are also 3 short practices covering breathing, relaxation, and meditation.This is a good DVD and I highly recommend it. The audio option and timer are great additions to this DVD which I have not seen on other productions. The more I use this DVD, the more I like it. Check my other DVD review on Amazon. Namaste'

$REVIEW.: I agree completely with David Rooney of Variety on this one. "A bland road movie running on empty with a deluxe cast wasted on by-the-numbers material. There's a big difference between a filmmaker who can actually convey with real feeling the pain of loss or the courage required to carry on, and one who merely connects the dots to illustrate it." Bottom line: it's worth watching once for the gorgeous photography and the wonderful actors, but I won't be watching it again.

$review_text.: This movie does not get a lot of mentioning, very likely because it is not made by big name animation studio or producers like Pixor or Dreamwork's. The original story was written by French, and the movie was made by French. The movie is one of the best among the animation films because its creativity in the design of the world, the lovable and crazy characters, and the emotional appeal. Last but not the least like mentioned in other reviews here, the quality of the environment and the animation. I think Dragon Hunters is one of the best animation films, among the ranks of Finding Nemo etc.

$review_text.: I should start by saying I really did like this movie, basically because I like Steven Spielberg movies in general.  But after a while it started looking like a "who's who" of his past (albeit great) films, and a big part of the enjoyment became trying to spot the next "cameo" by a previous scene, plot device, or character.  We have the "clever-kids-who-know-way-more-than-the-clueless-adults" of just about every Spielberg movie ever made (ET comes most to mind, for obvious reasons); we have Chief Brody from Jaws (a Sheriff's Deputy this time instead of a Chief of Police, and Lillian, Ohio instead of Amity Island, but you get the idea); we have vehicles driving down a dark, star-covered road in the middle of nowhere when mysteriously all the power goes out (Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters, anyone?); we have a baddie/villain/whatever-it-is that we see more and more of as the film progresses (Jaws again); we have dinner-table scenes with kids behaving more wild and out-of-control than any reasonable parent would ever let their kids behave (Close Encounters, again?); and I won't give any spoilers, but suffice to say that the film concludes in a very true-to-form Spielbergian mode.  And let's not forget the 2 inescapable contributions by JJ Abrams -- excessive and intrusive lens flares everywhere you turn (Star Trek?), and the moody (and beautiful) music by Michael Giacchino (L O S T).  But I did like it -- very fun way to spend a summer Saturday afternoon

$REVIEW.: I have been waiting for years to see Jamie Foxx take his rightful place in the pantheon of great American performers


He is a gifted actor, funny-man ( who can forget the I'm gonna rock your world lady from " In Living Color " ) and a very skilled musician


In " On Any Given Sunday " Foxx showed the movie viewing public that he could deliver a first rate, solid dramatic performance
I also have to admit to loving " Booty Call ".Cruise has always been a bit of a problem for me


I have disliked many of his films; particularly those projects where he has been a producer


I have found that there is a limit to how many shots of his hair, smile and steely gaze that I can stand


I include " The Last Samurai " as one of the worst big productions of all time

Still..


he was wonderful in " Rain Man " and I thoroughly enjoyed his work in " Minority Report "
However I have always believed that he has done his sincere best and is capable of great generosity with his fellow performers.In " Collateral " Cruise intelligently takes a step back and lets Foxx shine

His performance as a professional killer is nuanced, and well developed


It would have been so easy to overplay his hand and start chewing scenery, but instead, he has shown an intense restraint that is very powerful, and creates the room that Foxx needs to leave his imprint on this film.Foxx has established, once and for all, that he can hold the screen as a lead in a big time, big budget movie


He puts all of his wide range of dramatic and comedic to superb use

In numerous scenes he subtly uses his eyes alone to described shifts in his thinking and moods
He also has demonstrated that special ability to merge so thoroughly with his role


that it is easy to forget that it's Jamie Foxx on the screen.The films plot move at a quick pace, but not so fast that there isn't time allowed for scenes and moods to be well established

The overall casting is perfect
The movie is beautifully filmed


The direction is first rate without being overbearing.Jada Pinkett Smith also shines as a Federal prosecutor

I swear she grows lovelier with each passing year, and her screen presence and acting ability have followed a pace.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the contribution to this film of Irma P


Hall
She came to acting late in life and brings her wisdom and life experience to every role she plays


She is an American treasure!This is a first rate action thriller
Don't miss it!

$review_text.: Having just marked the 5 year anniversary of September 11th, 2001, this concert still encases the emotion of that day perfectly. Recorded in Sting's backyard in Italy, it's a concert that almost didn't take place. Recorded on that fateful day in 2001, Sting nearly called it off. Wisely, it's my feeling, Sting and his band chose to go on with the show. Nothing can bring people together in times of sorrow better than music. Memories of that day still haunt us all, but this simple event in the backyard of Sting's villa proves that even on that day, there were people who believed in a better world. We, as human beings, share our grief and our joy. Regardless of what color your skin is or which country you hail from, that day taught us all the meaning of love and companionship. And Sting simply put a beat to it, gave us a soundtrack to explore our emotions. A somber event to be sure, but it's not without joy. For underneath all the pain of that day, there's a glimmer of hope.

Kind of disappointing as they were much funnier than what the filmmakers included here. The pimp scene dialogue is much better on the torrent version I saw for instance. I'd say buy this for picture quality if youre crazy about formats, download for a funnier version that flows a little better.

$REVIEW.: After the great Friday the 13th we have the even greater Friday the 13th part 2. This movie uses humour as well as teen terror. The comedical element makes it unique from the others in the series. After the events at Camp Crystal Lake, a training camp on the same route has opened and counsellors arrive for a summer of fun!So who are these counsellors - who have given up their summer to play victim to Jason Vorhees?Ginny - a girl next door type who in some ways is very similar to Alice in Friday the 13th but has more girl power. Alice may have defeated Mrs Vorhees but can Ginny take on Jason?Paul - the mastermind who opened the training center ignoring any rumours linked to Camp Crystal. He and Ginny look foward to a summer of passion.....is that what they'll get?Sandra and Jeffrey - the perfect couple. Camp is a chance to be together and to investigate Camp Crystal. Will they disturb the peaceful Camp and awaken the evil? Should they have listened to Crazy Ralph?Terri, Mark, Vicky and Ted - more camp counsellors who have entered the biggest death trap. Will camp be the greatest experience? or will they be saying their prayers before sundown?Alice - she defeated Mrs Vorhees and was the only survivor at Camp Blood - will she be so lucky this time round?Friday the 13th part 2 has become my favourite Friday film. The humour element made this movie a cracker! The situations and things that happen can be so stupid and you'd say 'why did you do that...are you stupid?' and thats what makes Friday 2 so great! Every horror needs a slice of comedy. It is so entertaining and has continued the terror with style.

$REVIEW.: What the hell is the matter with Woody Allen?  The man is certainly wealthy, so he doesn't need the money.  He is independent, so he is not under any contractual obligation to turn in a certain number of movies.  He is a big name director, so he can work with any actor he wants.  So why does he insist on putting out continually mediocre product?  As if the twin duds known as Hollywood Ending and Anything Else were not bad enough, now comes Melinda and Melinda.  At least HE and AE could claim to bore the audience with only one storyline; M&M has the conceit to bore us with two.  The framing sequences reveal that M&M's dual storylines represent "tragic" and "comic" riffs on the same premise.  But that is false.  The alleged "comic" storyline is so leaden, you will find there are as few laughs within it as within the "tragic" story.  I know Woody still has talent for true comedy.  The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, released about a year before Hollywood Ending, was actually quite funny.  I don't expect you to recapture your comedy glory days from Sleeper and Bananas (to name just two), but Woody, baby, if you are going to put a comedic talent like Will Ferrell in a movie, at least make it funny!

$REVIEW.: This seventh volume of TCM/Warner Brothers/Warner Archive's FORBIDDEN HOLLYWOOD series finally makes available on DVD for the first time two of Warren William's best films, both of which were responsible for rocketing him to the top of his profession, albeit briefly.  This set, the third under Warner's Archive imprint is set to be released on factory-pressed DVD's for it's initial run, as were the previous volumes.  I was hoping that Warner Archive would release a remastered set featuring EMPLOYEE'S ENTRANCE and SKYSCRAPER SOULS with two of his other star performances, THE MOUTHPIECE and THE MATCH KING (I even contacted them a while ago), but hopefully these will also be released in the near (I hope!) future. Now on to the contents......"Love is as useful as wings upon a cat..." or so thinks Tong leader Nog (Dudley Digges, THE EMPEROR JONES) in 1932's THE HATCHET MAN from First National directed by William Wellman (NOTHING SACRED, A STAR IS BORN).  Edward G. Robinson (LITTLE CAESAR, THE CINCINNATI KID) stars in the titular role of as Wong Low Get, an Americanized Chinese tong assassin for the Lem Sing Tong. Except for the opening prologue, Robinson sports the tiniest of eye makeup, which can't be said for Loretta Young (ALONG CAME JONES, THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER) as his adopted ward and eventual wife.  Having to sport heavy kabuki makeup and jet black wigs, she was rewarded with a gorgeous wardrobe including a spectacular wedding outfit complete with massive headdress and a gown that sparkles as if made of a million LED's!  The ornate sets aren't too shabby either, as lavish as any MGM production.  The plot, although not very "P.C." at times, follows Robinson's character through tong wars, marriage, betrayals and eventual redemption, with a little help from karma and Buddha. The rest of the supporting cast is populated with mostly American character actors as Asians as was typical at that time, including J. Carroll Naish, Ralph Ince and Leslie Fenton. The print used is in great shape, probably due to it's obscurity. Fast moving with nary a dull moment, THE HATCHET MAN, available for the first time on home video, provided Eddie G. with a different take on his well-known gangster persona. Although now more of a snapshot of the times in which it was made, it still has the power to entertain in that fast-paced Warner's style..."...half way to hell and all the way to heaven!" is ruthless financier Dave Dwight's description of the skyscraper that takes his soul to both in the fascinatingly contemporary SKYSCRAPER SOULS (1932).  As portrayed by my fave, Warren William (on loan to MGM), Dwight's obsession with the creation that bears his name is all consuming, that is if he isn't trying to seduce virginal Lynn (Maureen O'Sullivan, TARZAN, A DAY AT THE RACES), the new secretary of HIS secretary and long-time mistress Sarah (Varree Teasdale, PAYMENT DEFERRED, ROMAN SCANDALS). Lynn is tempted but torn between "the good life" and her on-again, off-again randy jealous boyfriend Tom (a thoroughly annoying Norman Foster). After the success of GRAND HOTEL, MGM decided to set it's successful multiple intertwining stories plot device in the new modern marvel, the skyscraper. And what a skyscraper it is, benefiting from  MGM's usual high production standards and great art deco set decor.  Shown dwarfing the Empire State Building during the credits, the phallic 100-story Dwight Building sets the stage for plots that could be ripped from today's headlines.  Beside the usual trials and tribulations of desired, jealous, unrequited and forbidden love, the inside trading, double-crossing and financial shenanigans that ruin those that can afford it the least, are all too familiar. Populated with great character actors, the lack of an all A-level cast like GRAND HOTEL works in the film's favor. You quickly become emotionally involved with the characters' trials and tribulations. Will jeweler Jean Hersholt (GREED, DINNER AT EIGHT) ever find love with model with a past Anita Page (SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK)?  Will Myra (Helen Coburn) leave her unemployed husband for lover Slim (Wallace Ford, FREAKS, THE INFORMER)?  Is Dwight's happily estranged wife (Hedda Hopper) going to divorce him or bankrupt him first? Look close for fun cameos by veterans Edward Brophy (THE THIN MAN GOES HOME) and Tom Kennedy (THE TORCHY BLAINE SERIES). The only thing that keeps the film from being 100% classic is the cloying hammy performance by Norman Foster as Maureen's jealous "juvenile" (in EVERY sense of the word) love interest. Warner Archive's newly remastered print still has the occasion scratch, but is welcomed compared with previous "as is" releases. With surprising plot turns and a shocking "don't tell" finale, SKYSCRAPER SOULS will probably (and sadly) remain relevant for another 81 years......"My code is smash or be smashed!" opines cynical Kurt Anderson in First National's EMPLOYEES' ENTRANCE (1933) starring Warren William in another of his signature roles.  Directed by prolific director Roy Del Ruth (KID MILLIONS, THE BABE RUTH STORY), William is the ruthless general manager of Franklin Monroe & Co. a major department store whose earnings increased tenfold during his first decade. A type triple-A personality, he lives and breathes the store, occasionally stopping to seduce the new girl de jour. His latest conquest is desperate young Loretta Young (THE STRANGER, THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER) rewarded with a position after an evening of practicing a few with Warren. With the Depression affecting sales, Anderson starts culling the complacent senior staff and begins to mentor young Martin West (Wallace Ford, THE INFORMER, SHADOW OF A DOUBT) who's impressed him with fresh ideas. Unfortunately Warren's advice on women, "love 'em and leave 'em," forces West to hide his marriage to, you guessed it, Loretta Young. The film's ruined businessmen, suicide attempts, seductive secretaries and uncooperative fourth floor lavatory are interspersed with sometimes un-PC vignettes (a Jewish customer turning down a pigskin football, for example). The print is great, considering, and the trailer is in better shape than usual. Peppered with the usual great Warner Brothers character actors (look for Allen Jenkins as a store detective) and a totally satisfying and mostly unsentimental ending (strangely similar to another great Pre-Code boiler,LADIES THEY TALK ABOUT), EMPLOYEE"S ENTRANCE is superior entertainment.  Those running our government (and the European Union) could learn a thing or two from Kurt Anderson......"No one has any rights about me, but me!" So states proto-feminist artist Bette Davis (do you really need a list of her credits?) in the uneven EX-LADY, a 1933 First National release directed by Robert Florey (THE COCOANUTS, MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE). Bette is having what seems to be an exclusive affair with advertising agency owner Gene Raymond (RED DUST, THE BEST MAN). Watching Raymond I kept getting the feeling that it was Nelson Eddy in disguise. Imagine my surprise while doing research to find he was married to Jeanette MacDonald! So much for her platonic feelings for frequent co-star Eddy......but I digress, anyhow this film has a Pre-Code reputation for a risque plot and salacious scenes. Although tame today, a woman openly having pre-marital sex and expousing open relationships (to her uptight father's face, no less) was hot stuff in it's day, but hot stuff alone won't carry a movie. Davis and Raymond have a circle of friends that, excepting oily rival agency head Monroe Owsley (TEN CENTS A DANCE) and the constantly 'on the prowl' wife (Kay Strozzi) of an older boiler scion, are dreadful bores. Meant to be comedic, the focus on just how boring they are has you glancing at your watch instead.  Even the usually entertaining Frank McHugh (I LOVE YOU AGAIN, ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT) is a snooze fest. Davis and Raymond eventually marry, and a scene during their honeymoon in Cuba is probably what gives it the salacious rep, and boy does it earn it (hot, hot, hot)! Unfortunately things cool for good afterwards, and the usual couplings and un-couplings lead us to the all too expected conclusion. The print is in great shape for it's age and includes a period trailer. Known as the first flick with Bette's name above the rest, she's the best thing going for it. Towering over Raymond and everyone else, young, blonde and pencil thin, you can feel the heat rising down below......Links to the other collections:Forbidden Hollywood Collection: Vol. 1,Forbidden Hollywood Collection: Vol. 2,Forbidden Hollywood Collection: Vol. 3,Forbidden Hollywood Collection: Vol.4,Forbidden Hollywood Collection: Vol. 5,Forbidden Hollywood Collection: Vol. 6,The Warren William Collection,Perry Mason Mysteries: The Original Warner Bros.

$review_text.: If you are looking for bad movies, this one will exceed your expectations in every department: directing, acting, writing, photography, film editing, color processing, special effects, music, sound and any other category you can mention. The script is unforgivably rotten. God help us if the real members of our US Navy are as clueless and inept as the ones depicted here. They are rendered totally helpless by a bunch of acid-oozing, semi-mobile tree ferns that lamely flap their fronds, although with fatal results for several people and a small dog. In fact, for most of the film, the Navy nit-wits cannot figure out the source of the problem, even though they have just flown back the mysteriously exotic specimens from Antarctica and people and penguins have vanished from the airplane. They stand by helplessly holding flashlights while their colleagues get eaten by the plants. Later we see fighter planes strafing what look like garbage cans on the march. The movie makes many truly humiliating attempts at humor -- and Mamie van Doren's sweater reveals more about bygone fashions than her alleged sex appeal for adolescent boys. Meanwhile, the print offered by Amazon has faded into blurry shades of green and orange, and the widescreen image has been savagely cropped. I watched it video streaming and found it wondrously stupid. Accompany your viewing with glasses of Chateaux de Coca-Cola '2013 and microwaved Velveeta nachos.

$REVIEW.: Ok where do I start? I've loved every Hellraiser sequel to date, except this one. Being a college film student, I know what a very low budget student film looks like & this is it. This poor excuse for a sequel could have been made by one of my film school friends for less than $50! The plot is simple & seems to be written so that the studio could churn it out fast & cheaply. I won't even start to talk about the absence of Doug Bradley, because it's another problem entirely! If you want a good Hellraiser sequel, get a copy of a fan-film called "No More Souls". It's better on so many levels. I only bought this DVD because I want a complete collection. Skip this if having a complete collection of Hellraiser sequels isn't important to you.

The effects were cool looking but this is really an un-original mix of Armegeddon, Real Steel, Independence Day (complete with a speech) and Voltron
All of which on their own are better then this movie

$review_text.: I have owned a fitness ball for at least 8 years, and this DVD is the first time I have found an effective workout utilizing the ball that I can stick to.  I thoroughly enjoy the different workouts on the DVD, especially the "Arms & Shoulder Sculptor" (which combines the fitness ball for core stability with light weights for arm sculpting) and "Firm, Flat Abs" segments.  My muscles can feel the workouts when I'm done, but the workouts are fun and Kimberly Spreen is an excellent motivator, so using this DVD never feels like a chore.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone looking for an effective way to get in shape using a fitness ball.

$REVIEW.: While nothing beats the experience of a live Dierks Bentley concert, this video captures the best elements and is the second best thing.  The concert features many of his big hits like "What Was I Thinkin?", "Come a Little Closer" and "Lot of Leavin' Left to Do" as well as some album cuts and some covers (including "Folsom Prison Blues" and even a bit of "Tiger By the Tail").  True fans have come to expect a Bluegrass inspired poriton of the concert and will not be disappointed.The bonus footage includes live interviews of the band and crew as well as a guest appearance by Jake (trusted mascot and star of album covers and videos).This is a great concert video you will want to watch over and over again.

$review_text.: Tim Allen returns to role that gave him his biggest box office success back in 1994


Good 'ol Saint Nick


Why did it take so long to get a sequel to the smash hit original made?


Well, Allen himself said they could never find the right storyline and that they wanted it to be perfect

It took 8 years to find the right story?
The plot of this movie pretty much sounds like the obvious storyline to do, so I'm surprised it took them almost a decade to realize it


Scott Calvin(Allen), has been Santa in the north pole for many years now and many believe that he has been the best Santa ever


The glimpses into the north pole and the Santa village and workshop are wonderful

This is what I have always imagined the place to look like

However, the place is located underground, and that's the first time I have seen them do that


Head elf Bernard(David Krumholtz), is back, and is followed around by the #2 elf, who is played by Spencer Breslin, who was seen in &quot;The Kid&quot;, and the upcoming &quot;The Cat In The Hat&quot; movie

Santa gets his annual naughty and nice list and is shocked to see that his son, Charlie, is on the naughty list


But Bernard has bigger news


It is written in the clause agreement that made Scott Santa that he has to get married, get a Mrs

Clause, or he will be desantified

Will no longer be Santa
Ho no!

He travels back to town to catch up on what Charlie has been doing, being reunited with his ex-wife, and her horrible sweater wearing husband Neil, once again played by Judge Reinhold


As the desantification beings, and Scott begins to shrink his body weight and lose the beard, he gets involved with Charlie's ice princess principal, Principal Newman, played by the lovely Elizabeth Mitchell
He realizes that she may be the one he has been looking for, but has to get her to realize it before his time is up and he is no longer Santa
In the meantime, the north pole is being overrun by a replacement Santa who quickly becomes dictator-ish and causes chaos and mayhem
This sequel is sweet, warm, and fun
I can't say it is as good, or has the same kind of magical feel and quality to it as the wonderful original, but it comes close
Then again, what sequel really does?

It's good, clean family fun, and everyone should enjoy it
Tim Allen, not surprisingly, carries the film


There were moments and scenes with no real spark, but were made by his being there
His jokes and overall presence lift the film and make it what it is


Eric Lloyd returns as Charlie, and he isn't bad

Dealing with young teen angst and the big secret he has to carry about his father really weighs on him and he does a pretty good job of making it seem real
Nothing special, but he gets the job done
I would of liked more screen time for Reinhold, but what are you going to do?


What the film lacked was the awe and specialness of the original


The original just seemed natural as these magical things begin to happen and everyone has to deal with them


Since everything has been set for quite some time now in this film, the enchantment isn't the same

Don't get me wrong because it is still there, but it's not the same
SNL alum Molly Shannon delivers one of the best moments when she cameos as a potential love interest for Scott


She delivers a doozy of a Christmas tinged Shania Twain song and it's hilarious

Also, original cast member Peter Boyle, who played Scott's boss in the oringal, has an uncredited cameo here playing Father Time
So, in the end, what you get is a really fun, nice movie that gives sequels a pretty good name

There's no harm, no foul, but the first is still the best.

$REVIEW.: First Contact starts of with a major offensive against Earth by the Borg, and every Federation starship possible is involved, including the Defiant and the new Enterprise. But before they can be destroyed, the Borg travel back in time to 21st century Earth in the hope of changing the course of history in their favor. The Enterprise follows, and must make sure that the first contact with aliens takes place, or the Federation will never be founded, and the Borg will take the galaxy apart.But what I did not like is that you did not get familiar with the new Enterprise as well as we should have. The ship represents the Star Trek franchise even better than Kirk. But we only get glimpses of it, no stats on it's performance, etc. Plus, the movie drags along. I have no problems with a slow movie, but this one just seemed to slow without much of plot or character development.It is not a bad film, just not as good as Generations, or the Voyage Home. It is of course worth checking out, but not to buy. The only redeeming value is the astounding picture and sound on the DVD version.

$REVIEW.: While there is no doubt that JU-REI borrows many elements from such films as JU-ON and RINGU, this should not be seen as a negative thing. Rather than call it "plagiarism," I would class JU-REI as yet another entry into a particular canon of Japanese ghost/horror films.While not as scary or intense as JU-ON, JU-REI conjures up a very eerie and suspenseful mood, which it sustains from beginning to end. Like JU-ON, the timeline of the narrative is fractured. In this case, the events of the film occur in reverse chronology. This turns the film into a kind of puzzle, which definitely invites a deeper sense of audience participation than your usual gore-fest. In fact, multiple viewings are the only way to get the most out of this film.Although JU-REI runs only 77 minutes, the pace is often slow, but this adds a sense of reality and normalcy to the events. I mean, real life isn't "edited" for maximum effect! This pacing makes the weird occurrences --say, a ghostly face suddenly peering out of a trash basket -- all the more effective. And the performances add to the realism. Too often, in big-budget "horror" epics, we are very aware that we're watching actors, elaborate sets and spectacular effects. In JU-REI, the story unfolds with people and in locales that are completely ordinary. Their sense of horror at the intrusion of the terrifying/supernatural in their everyday lives becomes both palpable and believable as a result. One scene, in particular, featuring one of the girls' fathers in a hotel room, is a fine example of horror creeping into one's soul, of a victim not wanting to believe what is happening right before his eyes. The girls themselves carry their roles with a natural quality that makes their scenes credible. The film is visually appealing, as well -- moody and foreboding.In summary, JU-ON is a prime example of what a talented film maker can achieve with a limited budget, a talented cast & crew, and a true feeling for the subject matter. The ghosts in JU-REI are detached yet malevolent, eerie yet very much bound to the earth and normal human events and consequences. It's interesting that, sometimes, the horrors seem to silently observe from  afar. Other times, they're right in someone's face. It keeps the viewer guessing.Really, this is THE way to do a ghost story. No huge mega-scenes or explosions. No CGI things flapping around. No chic characters living in expansive city lofts or country mansions.JU-REI isn't epic in scope. It's an intimate excursion into the supernatural and menacing. If you enjoy Japanese ghost tales, it's well worth a shot.

$review_text.: Sidney Poitier recreates Vigil Tibbs for the last time in this film


Thank Goodness
The twice prevous times (the classicIn the Heat of the Night (40th Anniversary Collector's Edition)and its sequelThey Call Me Mister Tibbs!) had plots and were better developed than this film
This, perhaps,  is the Poitier film that has aged least gracefully.This film  seems standard TV cop fare of 1970's

It would be like a TV movie, if not for the star power of  Poitier
However if you are a fan of old cop shows,  this cast is filled with future TV cops..such as  Gerald S

O'Loughlin (The Rookies and Automan), Max Gail (Barney Miller), Bernie Hamilton (Starkey and Hutch), Ron O.Neal (The Equalizer and Superfly), Garry Walberg (Quincy ME) and Daniel J
Travanti (Hill Street Blues)The plot wears thin after a half hour
Gil Melle's jazz score overwhelms the watcher long before them

It seem to make a point, you need to have a louder jazz score..it dont work for me!It is the acting talent of Poitier that makes this film more than something you throw in a trash heap


His cool demeaner makes his character and this film still stand up
This film was Tibbs's film swan song and it acts like it...and please dont bring up the 1990's  TV version of "In the Heat of the Night", that charcter was so watered down for TV , it was BAD.One would wish someone in Hollywood remake land would recreate Tibbs for the movies, I would enjoy Don Cheadle playing it...ah wishful thinkingR.I.P

$review_text.: Interesting as it is, Freddy's Dead, The Final Nightmare is about as "Final" as Friday The 13th; The Final Chapter was. The biggest complaint I always hear about this film is that it was supposed to be the last one because they killed Freddy, okay, and how many other times did they kill Freddy? I seem to remember him getting the slash, if you pardon the pun, in almost every one of these films in the series. Is the film bad? No, not really.The origin parts really shine, contrary to some reviews here, and really give you a bit of a feel of what Kruegers childhood and subsequent adulthood was like when he was killing children. It gets a bit on the brutal side at times as the story telling here is actually quite serious, unlike most of the rest of the film which is one campy scene after another. Anyone though that can't tell that this was how the film was supposed to be presented really needs to go back and watch movies like Army Of Darkness and Cemetery Man to remember what the old tongue in cheek folms are like. Can they be bad and over the top, yup, and that's because they are supposed to be. What the movie is lacking in gore, it has some pretty funny parts and a well put together package. The 3D scenes are well put together, and the movie is just a good time, the way these were meant to be. Seriously, if you like the Emn Street movies, and for some reason you have lived under a rock and missed this one, I'd buy it and check it out. Horrow fan and not seen the Elm Street films? What's wrong with you? They are cheap and a good watch for sure, get off your butt and go get them already!

$REVIEW.: Yes, it's true, that as you watch the promos for this 7th season you will realize this set is missing a episode= "the Vatican"

That's annoying, certainly.But don't let that stop you from watching this great season of Penn & Teller


Let's look at what this season DOES have:"Orgasms"- Not that hard-hitting, but pretty interesting."Astrology"- one of their best de-bunking epi's yet."Video Games"- has a very controversial scene that you shouldn't miss."The Apocalypse"- the World is not going to end this December."Lie Detectors"- solid, hard-hitting facts here, and even some advice on how to beat this lying device."Organic Food"- actual blind studies & tests, and some very funny bits."Taxes": eye-opening."Lawns"- how lawns are wasting our time and ruining the environment

And how one guy went to jail for his bad lawn!"Stress"- you are not as "stressed' as you think you are, and a lot of nostrums are worthless.Yeah, the fact that Showtime decided to release this without "The Vatican" is annoying


But that doesn't mean this isn't a great seasons full of some of P&T; best stuff yet.So- yes, you should watch this


But buy used here on Amazon, not new.

$review_text.: Two stars and I am being generous. For the first time in a very long time I see that the people opting "against" this movie seem to have it right. I love Stephen King and this is one of the his short stories I have enjoyed a lot so naturally I got overjoyed when I found out they had made a movie out of it. Sad to say the joy just ended there. The movie is a sad excuse of an effort that never managed to capture the sense of desperation, pain and humanity of the story. The actors are all cartoonish (especially Slater's) wrong, too young, too detached, too out of place. I guess Hollywood's "adversion" to old age is too pervasive to overcome.In the story you get the exact feeling of what the Robinsons have and what they lost. In the movie the scenes before tragedy struck are just too mundane and unconvincing to covney the sense of desperate Mr. Robinson must have felt after losing his wife. It would be more believable if he just pocketed the insurance money and moved in with another woman shortly after. Slater is absolutely wrong as Dolan and the rest of the actors just look like they are just there to get this done quickly and go their way.A small anecdote: I watched the "Behind the wheel of Dolan's Cadillac" special feature and at one point they refer to Slater as a "Hollywood Legend"! Well guys and girls although I really like Slater as an actor and I have enjoyed a lot of his movies (especially True Romance) but a Hollywood Legend he is NOT by any stretch of the imagination. Leave this camp to Brando, De Niro, Streep, even Harrison Ford and other true legends.Back to the movie now, as I said, it might be entertaining to some, especially if they have not read the story but it falls short in virtually all departments like cohesion, acting, believability etc.I wonder why King does not have more say in the making (or un-making) of his books.

$REVIEW.: i think robert altman tried to offend many long held sensibilities with this movie.viewing it in 2002, it doesn't seem like anything too terribly offensive, but it probably had a little more bite when it was released.it's still very funny though, and you can't help but like these characters.. portrayed much more realistically here than in the subsequent television series.it's easy to see what the targets of the film's aim were:  war, religion, hypocrisy, inhibition (sexual and otherwise), and almost all form of authority.. and many of the scenes are very effective in their message.  particularly in a scene where a man believes he is about to commit suicide because he can't deal with the fact that he believes he might be a homosexual (he can barely bring himself to say the word).the doctors have set up a sort of ritual to see him out of the world, and the scene is set up to look like Da Vinci's painting The Last Supper... all while one of the men plays the guitar and sings the film's theme song "Suicide is Painless".  it's a richly textured scene, and the mood is so absurd and irreverent that one can't help but laugh.most of the movie has a similar tone.  it was a middle finger to the state of the world at the time the film was made.. and much of it still rings true today.and besides all that.. it's damn funny!

$REVIEW.: This account of one of the most unusual criminals (Aileen Wuornos) in the American justice system is absolutely brilliantly portrayed by Theron

 One of the best performances I have ever seen


 Chilling, desperate, woven through with a tender relationship with another woman, this tale - and the woman portrayed in the film - is devastating and compelling

 The physical presence of Theron's character is brilliant; this is an artist who transcends her own physical beauty, sacrificeses it by gaining weight for the ultimate reward: perfect characterization

 There is no trace of Theron left, only the high strung serial killer bent on living the life she longs for, while systematically ruining it with murder and prostitution


Ricci does a wonderful job as the unwitting "lover", and optimistically blinds herself to the dangerous aspects of Wuornos' out of control life
The random ugliness of prostitution is a stark contrast to the intimate and tender relationship between the two women; the violence bred into an abused woman is sad and terrifying to witness

 The disasterous results are sobering and thought provoking


This performance by Charlize Theron demonstrates the very best of what acting is all about
Truly, one of the premiere performances of our time


 100% recommended!

$REVIEW.: This film should be viewed as an addendum to the entire Two Season epic television series TWIN PEAKS. (They've finally worked all the bugs out of the TWIN PEAKS - THE DEFINITIVE GOLD BOX EDITION, which is a worthwhile purchase for all Lynch fans.) When viewing David Lynch's brilliantly underrated prequel TWIN PEAKS FIRE WALK WITH ME, it is important to understand some key elements to Lynchean symbolism. David Lynch is an adherent of Eastern Vedic philosophy and meditation. Along with Eastern Vedic thought, Lynch also mixes shamanism and Christian mysticism into the much bigger cauldron of "The Perennial Philosophy."  (A term made popular in 1945 by Aldous Huxley's book by the same name.) The Perennial Philosophy is the recurrence of all universal religious or mystical truths inherently found in most cultures.The Dreaming World: To mystics and shamans of countless cultures, the dreaming world is just as important as, if not more important than, the waking world. It is the place where the subconscious is free to associate with the superconscious mind, or the source of all consciousness. Like the dreaming world, the waking world is also a construct of perception. Pictures, images, and symbols. This is why it is hard to separate the dream world, or non-reality, from normal reality in most of Lynch's work. Dreams and normal reality are one and the same. The building blocks of the phenomenal world are illusive and illusory constructs. The pictures and images we witness as reality are essentially the same as the pictures and images we witness as dreams or non-reality. They are only constructs of consciousness. They are transitory states of perception that rise and fall out of emptiness.Like many other Lynch films, FIRE WALK WITH ME depicts the dual nature of a waking and dreaming world. These two worlds do not separate in The Lynchean Universe.Not all, but some of the actors from the TWIN PEAKS television series, and most of the critics, felt that Lynch had lost something with this film that was a part of the original television series: the dark underbelly of evil that was hidden just beneath the surface of a small idyllic town in Northern Washington. They felt that the film was too "in your face." (See the documentary on this disc.) While it is hard to witness, it was important for Lynch to pull no punches in depicting the events of Laura Palmer's tragic murder. Although it appears as such, the abuse and destruction of Laura Palmer is not a bogeyman lurking beneath her bed. It is the beast in man displayed in full form, breathing his foul stench into the face of the innocent. It is the curdled cream that floats to the top of a festering cup of evil coffee. A damn fine cup of evil coffee. It is not a story to be presented delicately or to be brushed under the rug to make it more palatable. It is a story of abuse that happens everyday. It depicts the harrowing, violation, and destruction of an innocent girl. Because of Sheryl Lee's brave and amazing performance, it is an extremely effective film. Psychologically and emotionally.The film begins with the investigation into the murder of Laura Palmer's friend Teresa Banks, and takes place one year before the final days of Laura's life. The beginning of the film seems tacked on and unrelated to the events that take up the majority of the film one year later. But, this prologue is not superfluous. It is important to understand the symbolism of The Disappearing Agents. (See below.)****************************SPOILERS*********************************The symbol of The Doors: Doors are used by Lynch as symbols for entering into and out of subconscious memories, the hidden aspects of the psychological mind, the dreaming world, Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory.The symbols of dream color: Dream colors are important to understanding Lynch. In dream sybolism, the color "blue" symbolizes truth, eternity, emotion, the feminine, and Heaven. Blue angels respresent guardian spirits or the super-ego. Blue light represents truth, enlightenment, Heaven, Nibbana (blowing out the FIRES of greed, hatred, and delusion), or Nirvana. I don't fully understand the meaning of the Blue Rose. Agent Cooper, referring to the murder of Teresa Banks says, "This is one of Gordon's Blue Rose cases." What does he mean? As blue can also represent sadness, it may signify the murder of a lonely girl, unclaimed by family or friends. The color "red" symbolizes power, anger, hatred, the id, primal and sexual urges, the masculine, and Hell.The symbols of The Black Lodge and The Red Room: The Black Lodge represents the purgatory of samsara, ignorance, or the blinding ego of the self. The Red Room in the Black Lodge represents the lowest level of the self in The Black Lodge. The id, the primal self, animal urges, suffering, murder, or Hell.  (Briefly, because it is not mentioned in FWWM, The White Lodge represents escape from samsara, egoless enlightenment, Nirvana, or Heaven.)The symbols of The Demons:  Bob is not presented as a symbol, but as a physical entity. Bob is an entity that feeds on fear, pain, and sorrow. "Garmonbozia." As a symbol, The Demon Bob represents the id, primal animal instinct, suffering, and/or pure evil. The Boy in the Mask (The Jumping Man) represents the fusion of the Leland/Bob personality. The monkey behind the mask represents Leland's primal self. Bob as his dark half. The incestuous and animal urges of Leland's id. The dwarf, or Man from Another Place represents the missing arm of The One Armed Man (Philip Gerard). The dwarf is The One Armed Man's connection to his base or animal self, The Red Room, and to Bob. He is still partly trapped in that world by his own karma. (At one time, The One Armed Man committed atrocities with Bob. Or, was possessed by Bob.) Other demons may represent other hidden aspects of the primal mind.The symbol of Bob as psychological denial: Unfortunately, Laura is in many ways a victim of forces beyond her control (rape and incest). This makes her journey even more frightening and sad. The manifestation of Bob represents Laura's psychological denial of her incestuous rape by Leland.  The memory of Leland raping Laura since she was 12 years old, is replaced with the image of Bob as her attacker. Instead of fleeing from the years of abuse, Laura hides her true self inside her secret diary. As do most victims of abuse, Laura escapes psychological and physical torment into a world of self-abuse, drugs (cocaine), alcohol, and prostitution. (Sometimes victims of abuse will cut themsleves, which thankfully, Lynch does not portray here. )Years of abuse become psychological transference. Laura feels she doesn't deserve love on any level. She is empty and worthless. She becomes a self-loathing symbol of sexual lust, perversion, and desire to men. In the days proceeding her death, her choices are becoming limited, and her destiny is almost etched in stone. A force of karma that must be played out. In the most profound scene of the entire film, before heading into the hedonistic Pink Room, Laura receives a warning from The Log Lady about the path she has chosen to continue upon, which is only partly, of her own making. It is heartbreaking."When this kind of fire starts. it is very hard to put out. The tender bows of innocence burn first and the wind rises - then all goodness is in jeopardy."LOG LADYEventually, Leland/Bob finds Laura's diary, steals her true self, and shatters her identity completely. Only after many years of psychological trauma and denial, does Laura finally realize that Bob is actually her father Leland. Innocence is completely destroyed. Laura gives in to utter abandonment and fear, which leaves her defenseless against her total destruction.  That fear is completely devoured by Bob, who only exists to feed on fear.The symbols of The Pictures: The original picture that hangs upon the wall of Laura's bedroom depicts children being served food by a guardian angel. This picture represents the love, warmth, comfort, and protection of home, which is disappearing for Laura. The other picture given to her by The Demons from The Black Lodge, which she later hangs upon her wall, depicts an empty room with an open door. This picture represents the Door to Hell. The disappearance of the guardian angel from the original picture on her bedroom wall symbolizes a point of no return for Laura. Laura's descent has taken her so far down the road to Hell that her guardian angel spirit (also symbolized by Agent Dale Cooper) can no longer save her from her fate, karma, or destiny. The second picture or symbol, supplants or usurps the original. Once Laura is pictured inside the door, there is no return. She will die.The symbol of The Guardian Angel: A recurrent symbol for Lynch. By the end of the film, Ronette Polaski's guardian angel appears to her, as Laura is being murdered by Leland/Bob, and spares her from Laura's fate. (Ronette is later found alive in the TV series.) Only after Laura dies is she visited in the Red Room by her guardian angel and Agent Cooper. She then realizes that her pain and sorrow has reached an end. She will be released from puragtory, samsara, and suffering. A better world awaits her on the other side.The symbols of The Green Ring and The Disappearing Agents: Agent Desmond (Chris Isaak) is transported to the Black Lodge after finding The Green Ring under the trailer and bending over to pick it up. Like the Door to Hell picture, The Green Ring symbolizes a path of no return. When Laura puts it on, she will die. Green symbolizes a "going out," traveling, or leaving this world. The disappearance of Agent Jeffries (David Bowie) and Agent Desmond symbolize the good men who investigate these horrible crimes. They are transported into a psychological Hell, from which there is little or no escape. These are men that risk their own sanity and psychological well being in their battle with evil forces, and their search for justice. (In the series, while inside The Black Lodge, Agent Cooper agrees to trade his soul to Windom Earle for Annie Blackburn's. Annie's murdered image appears briefly in FWWM. Cooper himself becomes possessed by Bob at the end of the series. Too bad we never got to see where that journey would lead.) I choose to believe that the disappearing agents are Lynch's symbolic homage to them. They are the brave ones that walk around inside the psyches of these demons. Sometimes, they never return from the Hell of what they've seen. Hence, their disappearance in this film.********************************************There are animals rapists, demons, and monsters that walk among us. FIRE WALK WITH ME is an amazing metaphor for the destructive power they possess over their innocent victims. The victims can either be total strangers, or the immediate family members of these evil beings. The abused often become the abusers, and if not completely destroyed, often continue a neverending cycle of abuse and destruction. These themes are as just as profound today as when Lynch made this film. These monsters continue to walk among us.The DVD includes a great documentary with the reflections of the cast and crew on the entire TWIN PEAKS phenomenon. It also includes some online features which I have not perused. As with most Lynch films, the DVD is not divided into chapters.A very powerful film about a very dark subject. And, one of Lynch's best.Enjoy.

$review_text.: I liked it but not as much as &#34;The Wardrobe&#34;. To me, as a general observation, original takes are hard to match in subsequent part two's and part three's. My main objection is that all four of the original cast (of the first movie) should have been kept. The writers would have been better served, if the thread of 'The Wardrobe' had not been discarded altogether and thrusted its characters into new horizons. If all four original cast members were in this movie, it may have been easier to ease your expectations.

$REVIEW.: Let me state first that I am not an expert on Asian foreign films, but I am an avid movie watcher of many genres.Curse of the Golden Flower was just okay for me. The cinematography and special effects were great. The Behind-the-Scenes feature captured a lot of the mystery involved in the special effects, and the interviews with the cast were enlightening and humorous, giving us a peak inside thier true personalities.  Chow Yun-Fat provides an awesome performance.  It's not Gong Li's best, but she is, as usual, believable.  I'm a new fan!The idea for the story is good, but the delivery lacks - no fault of the actors, it's the script.  There are some areas where the lines are not believable and the best of actors might have a hard time pulling that off.  The movie also felt a bit rushed. I felt some scenes simply dropped off for no real reason.I would add this movie to any good DVD collection, even just for "guest" night.

I have literally seen more nudity on bus ads. The film has a dreamy cyclical quality to it. It has grown on me and continues to give me food for thought as time goes on. This film is still way better than most films that get made. The orgy scene and the scenes that follow are as scary and thrilling as anythging I have ever seen.

To create the character of the Mascot (an endearing stuffed dog), and place him at the Devil's Ball (with the most bizarre assemblage of creatures imaginable), reveals just how masterful Starewicz was, and why there has never been anyone like him to this day.  If you've never seen The Mascot, you have a gaping hole in your appreciation of great animation.

$review_text.: Critics who suggest "Syriana" hopeless are probably right, but only if they understand one of the movie's last scenes, in which a young Arab steers toward a gala on the deck of an oil refinery with a bomb aboard his little dinghy. Writer/director Stephen Gaghan denies the audience the ensuing carnage of the explosion and, in a sense, the point of his polemic. Through several storylines Gaghan unravels a corrupt American government in collusion with corrupt American oil business to establish capitalist democracy in Iran for the sake of raping its economy while thwarting democracy in another Middle Eastern country because its reformist emir dares to sell his oil to the Chinese."Syriana" does not lack hope for its depiction of this corrupt collusion, because Gaghan makes clear there is recourse against such corruption: The boy, with the bomb, on his dinghy will, as Tyler Durden scarily intones in "Fight Club," reset things back to zero. The best way to thwart power, Gaghan argues implicitly, is to play by power's rules - stab it in the gut until it bleeds, and commit oneself to death. It worked in Vietnam. It gave America pause on 9/11. And, Gaghan argues, it's all that keeps the power brokers honest. If "Syriana" is hopeless, it's because it's nihilist, not because it's too angry to see through its tears.Gaghan - who won an Oscar for his adaptation of "Traffic" - is an insightful, talented guy. But he's made a movie too busy  - "complex" is word used by critics who agree with his rant and so pretend movies should resemble a first affirmative constructive in high school debate - to develop a heart for any of the characters nor peddle a thesis that wasn't covered in "Fahrenheit 9/11."A CIA assassin named Bob, played by fattened George Clooney, generates the most press because he's played by fattened George Clooney. I personally could've cared less about how he's suddenly frozen out by his government, nor the plight of lawyer Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) who's assigned to investigate the merger of one of his firm's clients, which lost oil rights to the Chinese, to a much smaller oil company, which unexpectedly gained rights in Russia. Is it is a corrupt merger? Does a ribeye steak taste good?The only plot that seems new is that of an American energy analyst Bryan Wortman (Matt Damon) hired as lead consultant by Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) an Oxford/Georgetown scholar ready to drag his nation into the 21st Century by breaking the hold America has over his country's oil. His dying father only need name him emir over that hapless cad of a brother. Damon's analyst pulls no punches with his new client, partially because his son has accidentally died in the Prince's pool, and he thinks the job is a payoff - which it is. But the Prince really is prepared to heed his advisor's advice, to develop the economy, give women the right to vote, transform the region. Except that he sold oil to the Chinese. In a world of dwindling oil resources, your regular American Hummer owner can't afford that shortage in supply.Gaghan has something in this storyline, a kind of modern "Lawrence of Arabia." Damon and Siddig establish immediate chemistry; Damon makes a great policy wonk looking for a guy to believe in, and Siddig broadcasts that dashing political brilliance Kennedy enjoyed. Nasir's cause is a decent one, his eventual fate we can mourn, and all the Gaghan's aims can be translated through his struggle.We get one-fourth of that movie. Gaghan is more committed to his narrative skills. Let it be said the movie has several compelling images: Bob meeting an informant at the sea in Lebanon, then later having his fingernails pulled out by this same man; remarkable displays of Arabian opulence; a shot of a beautiful Iranian woman slipping a birka over her sexy party clothes at sunrise; young Arab boys watching videos of "martyrs" describe their eventual funerals.In short, "Syriana" is best described as a wordy, preachy mood piece that seeks the reflect "the mood" or "the climate" or "the complexity" of the modern world, and to show off how much it knows about the tyranny of the few in majority. It's that guy you know who has an addendum for every news bit you saw on TV. Of course I admire it, and one wishes we all had two years to photograph beautiful Iranian women and stage a scene at that six-star hotel in Dubai while nominally in pursuit of the schematic that blows the lid off this cloaked universe of power. Gaghan will get applause from the critic crust but he fails to grasp what captivates Americans: You can interlock four stories about the moral complexities of assisted suicide; or you can make "Million Dollar Baby" and close the picture with Saint Clint Eastwood eating key lime pie in a diner beside a box of Academy Awards. Americans like heroes, "Syriana" has none, and a story like this needs one.Because here's the deal: We're all paying through the nose for gas at the pump and Exxon recently reported record profits for last quarter. Is it corrupt? Is it corrupt? Can I pay eight bucks for the ribeye steak? What we need are personal stories, straight, tough, real, but personal. That, or the second coming of Howard Hughes - independently wealthy, bizarrely fixated on wind and solar power, and willing to tell oil executives to kiss both sides of his rump. Maybe he could date Amanda Peet, another perfectly gorgeous woman who is also in this movie.

$REVIEW.: *In film noir the source of discontent is the tedious/repetitiveness of modern life, and the most tedious task we modern characters are forced to perform is the reproduction of (an unjust) social world. Film noir characters are thus rebellious sociopaths who refuse and resist in whatever way they can, but often the form their rebellion takes is itself tedious/repetitive and so these characters quickly become fatalistic/nihilistic.*What is fetishized in film noir is crime itself. Because that is where the characters (and the audience members) experience their moment of rebellion, of freedom.*Of course the crime can take many forms: a hiest, adultery, a murder, looking at a painting, reading or writing a book, watching or making or acting in a film, or simply being onself (off camera).*Whats really wonderful about a fim like Beineix's Diva is that the crime is something as minor as illegally recording an opera and then stealing the diva's dress. In Diva, art (and art appreciation) is viewed as transgressive and exciting.*And whats wonderful about a film like Lynch's Blue Velvet is that the originary crime is simply boredom which begets curiosity which begets investigation which begets spying which begets awareness of every other form of transgressive behavior which begets knowledge.*In life most of us are forced to hide out from ourselves. We hide out from ourselves in jobs that we don't like, we hide out from ourselves in relationships that require us to act more socially presentable and acceptable than we feel like acting, we hide out from ourselves in suburbs, in family life, we hide out from ourselves in all kinds of ways. These jobs we take and the roles we play might be the very things that allow us to be ourselves, or at least certain versions of ourselves, but cinema is a place where we can acknowledge those other less social truths and less social selves that we must conceal in our everyday lives.*Sometimes everything about life feels fraudulent and we can't wait to get to the cinema to get a dose of truth. At other times its just the opposite.*Like Feuillade and Lang and Godard (and many other filmmakers), Assayas views the modern world as a series of enclosures and he locates the source of our discontent in the tedious professions that require us to occupy single enclosures and play single roles for extended periods of time. Godard's Breathless is wonderful because its about someone who is tired of playing a gangster but who simply lacks the imagination or will to perform any other role even though he seems like a natural actor. Irma Vep is wonderful because its about an actress who only comes alive (as herself) when she is not being viewed by anyone and can perform only for herself on the rooftops of Paris. In this film, the greatest thrill/crime is simply giving oneself the permission and freedom to be oneself.

Everybody is guilty of barbarism.It is violent, but not gratuitous.It accurately shows this was a time where when you stabbed someone, it was considered civilized to then slit their throat so they wouldn't suffer a slow death.The natives speak Gaelic, and they are subtitled, and this gives an eerie realism that wouldn't otherwise be there.

If your a person who enjoys a good movie to watch with your girlfriend then mayby this is the movie for you. this is definitly not for children because there is mature contents(saying this probably promotes younger people to watch this). This reveals about Yosho's first love and the only thing i liked about this was probably the ending music to the movie. My recommendation is that if you liked the first two movies then this is a major turn around for the series because there was hardly any violence and most of it was just watching tenchi going around in a parallel universe with another girl instead of with ayeka and ryoko.

Simply put, there was really only one funny part in Runteldat, the part when he was mimicking a drunkard having a onesided conversation with his wife


Other than that, Martin was whining and complaining about the bad press he's been getting

And the media has been singling him out and giving him the shaft but why commit an entire hour to talking about that I mean good grief

It brought back good memories as i watched it,and i did get a some good laughs. Its very hilarious,if your into cheap laughs just for the hell of it then this would be the movie for you.A very simple style of comedy, its just like "airplane" movie as such "hot shots","naked gun",etc... very old spoofy (the originals) As opposed to the new spoofys like "scary movie", "super hero","meet the spartans",etc. You totally recall all the movies its making fun of. Which makes it that much more funny.I loved it and would recommend it for one of those nights when there's just nothing to do or watch on tv/cable or cable is out just to have in your collection of movies. However my feelings on this movie is based in sentimental value so you may not connect with it as much as i did. You really got to be in the mood for something goofy!

$review_text.: Once more, Bryan Singer, the director of X-Men brings along a spectacular sequel, which possibly promises more & more. Once you've seen the first, you will definitely want to see the second, especially since you get to see even more of the rather lovely Hugh Jackman.All the old characters are brought back to fight another day, and we also get introduced to some new characters - some of the kids from the school get a bigger role, including Rogue's boyfriend, who will make sure that your drink is always `ice' cold. Another great new character is "Nightcrawler", played brilliantly by fellow Scot, Alan Cumming, who is almost as bad as Mystique, having at one point to be in make-up for 10 hours! (He appears topless in one scene, so that adds on the extra hours)All the now well known characters appear at the start, but they don't all appear at the end. Now, I wonder what that could mean? I was quite shocked at the apparent death of this particular popular character, as it seemed totally unnecessary, but never mind.Hugh Jackman is terrific once more as Wolverine, although he meets the female version of him, resulting in some rather painful looking scenes. There are also a few glimpses into his past, and it gets revealed about how he came to be as he is.Anna Paquin appears, and gets a quite good role, although the originally `white' streaks in her hair seem to have turned blonde between films! Her relationship with her `ice cool' boyfriend, briefly introduced during the previous film, develops, although not by much, judging by the effect she has on people!In this film, the humans are the baddies, and the renegade mutants join with the good guys to fight the threat. This results in some spectacular action scenes with explosive special effects.There are a huge amount of extras on the two disc dvd version, covering almost everything you could possibly want to know about the making of this film, from pre-production to post-production, including the special make-up effects used on Nightcrawler and Mystique.The four-disc special edition DVD containing both films and stacks of extras is highly recommended and well-worth the purchase price.

$REVIEW.: At their best, Joseph Losey's films are as sleek and sexy as the cool jazz he uses in many of them


"The Servant," one of his best known films, is most famous as the first of the director's collaborations with playwright Harold Pinter
Its success rescued Losey from years of blacklisting and his disastrous experiences on a film he personally valued more, "Eva." The film is also famous for Dirk Bogarde's performance as the butler-you-love-to-hate, Hugo Barrett
A successful matinee idol, Bogarde insisted on appearing in a series of commercially risky, but artistically daring productions, of which "The Servant" is one of the first.Like Kubrick's "Lolita," "The Servant" was made at a time when it was possible for filmmakers to flirt with previously forbidden topics (pedophilia in the first, sadomasochism in the second) as long as they suggested more than they showed


The indirection works to the advantage of both
"The Servant" is an insidious movie that works on your imagination far more effectively than an explicit exploration of the subject


The relationship between Hugo and his master Tony is never much more than a gradual, vaguely deepening dependency

That makes the action much more plausible and frightening


 As Hugo slowly takes control of Tony's life, we watch in horrified fascination, desperate to stop it, but powerless to do so.Much like Alfred Hitchcock, Losey's films exploit fear as much as desire, although that's where the similarities end
Hitchcock makes you nervous, but you always know the cause of the trouble, and you're ultimately brought safely home
Losey's films rarely locate their source of fear, and you're seldom let off the hook

Hitchcock alternates bravura suspense sequences with sophisticated comedy
Most of Losey's films are notoriously humorless, slowly building tension, never quite letting go, so that by the end you're likely to feel worked over.But worked over by a master


Be warned: if you find yourself watching "The Servant" beyond the first quiet, slinky scene between Barrett and Tony, you are almost certainly trapped


Even if you reject what you see, you're unlikely to turn away
Once Losey's feline, sensuous style has its claws in you, you'll watch the film slither through to the bitter end, almost in spite of yourself.

$review_text.: I laughed a lot during the first Scary Movie, I barely laughed at all during the second one though. I remembered what it was like to have a good laugh again though while watching Scary Movie 3. During the first one I would think " this is stupid", yet I'd be laughing hard while thinking that. The second one I just found plain stupid without the laughs. In 3rd, I once again found myself laughing thinking "this is stupid"  though. Jennifer Macarthy and Pamela Anderson are actually pretty funny in the beginning. I like how they poke fun at Pam's little home movie she made with Tommy Lee.Leslie Nielson is hilarious of course as the President of United States. Seeing him on screen again made me want to see a Naked Gun 4 get made because he still got it. Anna Farris is back and is pretty funny as Cindy Campell once again. I actually think she was the best part of all the movies. This time she's blonde and is supposed to be like the women in the Ring . She watches over this kid who's mom died giving birth to him. In a scene that's supposed to be like the one in Signs she trys to comfort him by telling him what his mom's birth to him was like. That's pretty funny as well becuase she's scaring him more than she's making him feel better.That kid alone gets laughs because he can read the future for people just by walking by them. Roger Ebert called him the Sixth Sense kid but the kid in that movie saw ghosts, he couldn't tell the future. So don't know what movie that idea was actually from. I like how when guy walks by with women and the kid says "you're gonna get luck" and to the women he says "he doesn't know you're a guy". Some jokes don't work that well like I said. The whole 8-Mile part just wasn't that funny. They could've done a lot more with it. I mean the guy that's supposed to be Eminem just raps normally and what he says isn't comical or anything. The part before that when he gets stage fright and runs to a stall to puke and pukes on a guy on the bowl got some laughs though. Although I liked this movie, I don't think they should make a 4th one. Since this movie is making a lot of money I'm sure they'll make another though.

$review_text.: For many years I avoided Viet Nam era war movies. It seemed hollywood was never able to present a reasonable portrayal of the period. This movie never seemed to grope with that problem. I've read reviews of this film that criticize Fox's acting (both his ability and style), trying to say he's no different in this film than in his prior comedy roles. Nothing could be further from the truth. Fox delivers a powerful yet believeable performance in Casualties of War. He becomes a seasoned combat soldier while at the same time retaining his humanity. I will also agree with other reviewers who have pointed out that this movie is one that leaves you feeling drained but remains one to keep because it is full of emotional content, superb acting, and a well told tale.

$REVIEW.: The USA 2-disc edition of E.T is now the only available DVD anywhere in the world. Universal discontinued the UK and Australian DVD releases some time ago to reflect the limited edition, and while this was to be the case in America too, it is obvious that it is still available there.Nevertheless, the USA edition was always the only one worth buying because it included the 1982 release. The Australian and UK releases are PAL formatted which doesn't allow as much disc space as NTSC. Distributors in these regions therefore decided that consumers would prefer the full length special features over inclusion of the 1982 version. A pity because the 1982 version is much better, and how most of us remember it. I think Universal short-changed it's international clients.Many reviewers have slammed the 2002 version because of the CGI tampering of E.T's character. I have to agree with them, the CGI has caused E.T to look too comical in scenes and quite unrealistic. I can't comprehend how Spielberg considers these alterations an improvement and more aligned to his vision. However, if you own the USA DVD, it doesn't matter because you can simply choose the better 1982 version. In my opinion, movies shouldn't be enhanced unless it is to improve their picture quality (ie. to remove grain, dust etc).Overall, a movie worth owning (providing you have the USA DVD).
$SUMMARY.: USA DVD is the only option

$review_text.: There are only two movies in the past three years that were so bad that I stopped watching midway through. The first was Serenity. The second was Brick. The title of my Serenity review was, "Looks Like Bad TV. Quacks Like Bad TV. Must Be....." Since I already used that title for a review, I didn't use it again for this review of Brick, but rest assured it fits.Brick, like Serenity, must have a serious cult following, because at the time of this writing both Brick and Serenity have an average of 4 stars and enough reviews to have led me to believe that the 4-star average ratings must have some credibility.So I tried Brick based on the 4-star average rating.Back at the beginning of the year I also tried Serenity based on the same premise: "If it's got 4 stars it's got to be at least halfway decent, right?" Wrong. Apparently the common denominator for both Brick and Serenity are the abundance of teens and young adults that for whatever reason are captivated by the plethora of bad TV plaguing prime time that targets the teen through 24 demo.Brick is about high schoolers that all somehow have the dispositions, intelligence, vocabularies, mannerisms and lifestyles of no-personality 30+ year olds. There's murder, a criminalistic "Kingpin" complete with posse & bodyguards, a high society seductress and a hero (all the stuff found in any normal high-school, no?...uh, not really). The high school hero is looking for those responsible for the murder and he gets mixed up with the high school Kingpin, his high school henchman and the high school high society seductress.Don't worry, no spoilers on the way....I didn't finishing watching, remember?I'm thinking that Brick was trying to be like a high-schoolers-go-Pulp-Fiction or something. But it played more like a bad, R-rated after-school movie special.So, if you haven't guessed already, I'd recommend completely missing this one. Don't buy it; don't rent it; don't waste 2 hours of your time when it comes on cable.And don't be bamboozled by the 4-star average rating.

$REVIEW.: Like many great films noir, THREE MONKEYS amounts to a lot of style attached to a slight amount of plot.  Whatever anyone else thinks, I consider that to be praise.A sleepy driver hits a pedestrian.  The driver is a politician with an election pending and, with a phone call in the middle of the night, he persuades his personal driver to serve the prison sentence for him.  This leads to disruptions in the driver's family, all of which brings about a melodramatically overwrought sequence of events.It is a B-noir plot from the forties, with a difference: Nuri Bilge Ceylan's screenplay and direction has an intriguing way of revealing action and consequences.  He makes us work, a little.  Sometimes we see only actions following each other, with no hint of what connects them.  Other times we see only the "dead" time in the spaces between the actions, and we have to infer what happened.There is an enormous breadth to Ceylan's cinematic knowledge.  From DISTANT, we know of Tarkovsky's influence; from CLIMATES, we saw his fondness for Tati, among others.  Here, in THREE MONKEYS, it is Jean-Pierre Melville that comes to mind, especially BOB LE FLAMBEUR, which was once described as a movie about "how gangsters brush their teeth."  But Ceylan has reached the point where his influences have become so uniquely swirled together, all you can truly say about him is that he is an original.Is THREE MONKEYS a highly-stylized movie?  You bet.  If there is some complaint about that, I'm afraid I don't understand.  It seems like complaining that Sam Fuller and Fritz Lang are overly-stylized.From my first viewing of DISTANT, I knew I was in the presence of a master filmmaker, but I never would have guessed he would go in this direction.  Movies ought to flabbergast us more often than they do.  I'm happy to say I have been flabbergasted.

$review_text.: If you've seen The Blair Witch Project, you probably fall in three categories - people who were scared stiff, people who didn't see what the big deal was, or people who got so motion sick that they had to stop watching. It's very much one of those divisive films, and I am proud to say that I loved this film and was left wide-eyed, gripping my seat tightly in the movie theater as the final credits rolled.The film, made for only $25,000 (though some have inflated that amount to $40,000) is presented in a "found footage" style, a truly novel approach as the film we're watching isn't being shown through some steady, static "magic window" looking in on the characters without their knowledge as nearly all films are presented. Later films like Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity also used the "found footage" approach, but this film was the precursor to them all, and every film that has used this style since has often been described as "Blair Witch  in a Godzilla Movie" or "Blair Witch in a House."Here, the cameras, the film stock being used, and the handheld "shaky cam" cinematography are all a part of the story. Presented as recovered film footage pieced together to present the journey of three student filmmakers making a documentary about a local legend who gradually find themselves becoming the legend's newest victims. This cinematic approach and the performances given by the "student filmmakers" (who were really a trio of young actors skilled in improvisation) was so effective and believable that many were lead to speculate that the film's events were real. But of course, they weren't. But Artisan Entertainment's marketing of the film harnessed that speculation through websites and message boards (being the first real film to utilize the then-fledgling internet as a legitimate promotional tool) and TV and radio ads that portrayed the film as true events. Moviegoers flocked to the theater to make up their own minds.What they got was the story of Heather, Josh, and Mike, who end up lost in the woods for over a week in late October of 1994 while filming a documentary about the Blair Witch, who some blame for numerous mysterious disappearances and deaths over the span of several centuries. Many days pass as the trio trek through the Maryland woods in their slow descent into fear, paranoia, and desperation. As they hike trying to find their way back to their car, frustrations being to mount as the map they brought proves useless, they run out of food, and the trio begin to turn on each other, bickering and arguing as their situation worsens.At one point, hope of escaping the woods truly becomes lost, as despite walking in the same direction for an entire day, they inexplicably end up back in the same place. It becomes clear that a supernatural force does not want them to leave, a force that leaves haunting, intricately made stick figures and rock piles for the trio to find during the day and terrorizes them by night with eerie sounds in the distance, leaving the trio (and the audience) to only imagine who or what stalks them just beyond the light of their campfire and just outside the view of their camera lenses. You too will peer into the darkness, looking for any kind of clue to what horrible creature is out there waiting for them. And as they are seemingly lead to a condemned house, your eyes are glued to the screen as their grim fate awaits inside.I can only guess why others don't find this film scary. Maybe people are so used to the typical approach of a static camera and smooth camera movements that the handheld approach takes them out of the film. Perhaps they are so used to films that show you a grotesque creature and buckets of blood and gore as a "payoff" that their imaginations never take over, and their hopes expectations for a typical payoff are left unsated since you never see the Blair Witch. Maybe they just see three kids roaming around in the woods with a couple of cameras that they can't see the creativity of being able to tell what is essentially a ghost story without the need for a big budget. Whatever the reason, it's truly their loss.The Blair Witch Project is a triumph of minimalist filmmaking, a film whose concept smartly takes advantage of the most basic elements needed to elicit fear, like the urban legend every small town has, the simplistic and natural fear of being in the woods at night in late October, and the fear of what lurks in the darkness just outside of your view.

$review_text.: Since reading &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;, I have become a virtual Everest '96 hound, and this is my first quarry.  The IMAX team's goal on Everest was to film David Breashear's expedition in that fateful year, focusing primarily on Ed Viesturs, a seasoned climber from the States, and Araceli Segarra, in her quest to be the first Spanish woman to reach the summit.  A lot of attention, deservedly so, is paid as well to Jangbu Sherpa, son of Tenzing Sherpa who accompanied Sir Edmund Hilary in his premier trip to the summit.And watching these climbers was riveting--ascending sheer sheets of ice, yards high, that look as though they are leaning in towards the climber; crossing bottomless chasms by placing an aluminum work ladder from one side to the other, and using it as a bridge; and feeling (in part through the excellent cinematography) the pull the mountain exerts on them to continue on.  But I was floored, completely, by the thought of the cinematic team following along, all the way to the top, regardless of the weight and awkwardness of the equipment. For example, in the aforementioned aluminum ladder scene, shots seem to be taken from each side of the chasm.  Had they carried that heavy equipment accross that ladder?  And, once they came down from such a difficult and draining climb,  they still managed to piece together a marvelous film.The cinematography, once again, is gorgeous.  Shots of the mountain convey not only its beauty, but its terrifying danger, as ice and whirling snow tower over the climbers, as a rescue helicopter wavers, uncertainly, as Liam Nelson explains the scientific impossibility of a helicopter to work in such thin air (it does).  Seeing the Icefall alone, I think, was worth the price I paid for the video.Warning:  If you get this movie expecting it to be a documentary covering the Adventure Consultants  and Mountain Madness Expeditions, chronicled in &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;, you will be disappointed.  The IMAX expedition was unrelated to the others, and of course the crew could not predict that those expeditions might yield more interesting, if tragic, results.  But the teams do interact with each other when it becomes clear that members are facing unexpected danger. I enjoyed &quot;meeting&quot; many of the folks I had read about.Finally, &quot;Everest&quot;, the film, stands on its own.  With a terrific story in Araceli Segarra, wonderful images from Utah and Spain as well as Nepal, and a score assisted by George Harrison melodies, it provides a great armchair journey to the top of the world.

Secondly Rollins promised that on this show he would be talking about important subject matter which he does and when interviewing celebrities promises that he will not discuss their love life, private affairs and other banalities which seem to be the order of the day, and again he delivers on that promise, and what's more the interviewees seem to be quite enthusiastic about this, leading to some enjoyable discourse, so if the idea of that makes you yawn because you've seen it all before then fair enough, but for me this material is not prevelant on my TV and so as someone who has watched Bush and co with a sense of foreboding I am grateful to Rollins for reminding me the other side of the coin hasn't been extinguished.

$review_text.: Although this is a low, low budget effort with a lot of flaws, I'm giving it three stars for three reasons:  1) Truth-in-advertising - you get blood (lots) sex (some) and nightmares (the main character dreams about a serial killer on the loose); 2) the female lead (Julia Morizawa) does a pretty good job; 3) it shows what you can do with a paltry budget if you give it a good effort.  When a couple go to do an "adult retreat" (otherwise called a sex camp) to rekindle their relationship, they find that the creepy groundskeeper is going around murdering everyone.  Sure, it's a typical slasher-in-the-woods flick but at least they're adults getting slashed for having sex, not teenagers-as-usual. It also includes some oriental mysticism and a few surprises. So if you haven't seen every camp killer film, or you can't get enough of them, you may want to check this out.

$REVIEW.: In 2089, the Weyland corporation sponsors archaeologists, including Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), who discover celestial maps on ancient walls in Scottish caves that match those in other ancient ruins around the world. Following these maps, an advanced spaceship called "Prometheus" travels across galaxies in a four-year span to reach a distant moon that matches the ancient maps. Among the crew of this ship is an all-purpose android named David (Michael Fassbender) whose intellect is nearly perfect and has immense capabilities and perhaps a growing sense of self. There is also a sage but salty captain, Janek (Idris Alba), a naively friendly biologist (Rafe Spall), a grumpy geologist (Sean Harris) and a corporate micro-manager, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). The exact mission of Prometheus is unknown as the initial thesis behind these suspected maps, that they were extraterrestrials who visited Earth thousands of years ago, may be the starting point of surprising and horrifying truths. To make things even more mysterious, we occasionally see hologram messages of the late, enigmatic Mr. Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) himself. What exactly is on the mysterious moon and why did the Weyland Corporation spend trillions on this voyage? Where will the search for the truth lead them?Prometheus is a semi-prequel and sidequel to its director's, Ridley Scott, 1979 film Alien. The film is very well-paced and it hooked me from the start. Scott still has his directing magic and the editing and cinematography are top-notch. Despite the alien moon being a gloomy and creepy place, the gray, purple and desert landscapes and skys are gorgeous. Like the original film Alien, the special effects, set pieces, costumes and props are imaginative and an interesting blend of modernism and futurism. Fear not, the unique, influencing styles of H.R. Giger are still to be found throughout the film. While the film was excellent in many technical ways, I was very disappointed by much of the story and some of the acting.Prometheus is a film Scott has tried to create for years and production began in 2009. Jon Spaihts developed an outline and rough draft of the script. Spaihts leaked script shows a much more explained and nuanced story as well as character development then the final product. Co-writer Damon Lindelof might be the reason behind the perplexing elements of the film. For instance, the protagonist Elizabeth Shaw was a well written, interesting character who was smart, strong and curious but she orders the crew to do something monumentally stupid shortly after Prometheus lands on the moon. In fact, there are a lot of horror film cliches where people (educated professional people, in this case) do things so ridiculously dumb even a sea sponge would know not to do. This is just poor writing.Still, this was a very good film with some memorable highlights. An unforgettable sequence unfolds at about seventy-three minutes into the film involving striking holograms; it is something like a gorgeously alien planetarium. I also enjoyed the authentic usage of Proto-Indo-European in the film; a nice touch by Scott and the other filmmakers in getting the details right rather than using gibberish or linguistic unobtainium. Michael Fassbender is given a very interesting role as an android who looks just like a man and mimics the feelings and expressions of people perfectly. Like a replicant, he has a fascinating emotional state as his mimicry might at some point in the journey have developed into an actual ego. Fassbender's performance is impeccable here. Rapace, Pearce, Alba and Theron all do well in their roles but the clear weak link is Logan Marshall-Green. His performance is closer to a drunken fratboy whose matriculation was due to his father being the dean than an actual archeaologist. Denise Richards was far more convincing as nuclear scientist Dr. Christmas Jones in The World Is Not Enough than Marshall-Green was here. That is saying a lot. For those who enjoyed the horror of the Aliens series, there are some very intense and squeamish scenes. Those who are a bit sensitive to body horror and gore might want to close their eyes during some scenes in Prometheus.I do not see the problem with the open-ended and unanswered questions in Prometheus. The film was designed to be the first in a trilogy, and great science fiction and pensive fictions require such questions to ask of its audience. The overall experience of Prometheus is dreamy, nearly surreal, with the great mysteries touched upon but only superficially addressed. This film fall far short of the truly great and cerebral, philosophical science fiction films such as Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Oydessy and Metropolis. Prometheus was entertaining and, at times, horrifying and scary. I appreciate the fact that Prometheus provided some amazing sights and entertaining mysteries, and it loosely had some heavy themes but it could have been a lot better without the plotholes. The sights and sounds of the film wowed me, but the story's flaws are unfortunately present.

$review_text.: Most of the well-known social satires dealing with white-on-black racism share the same strange thing in common:  They're not written or directed by African Americans.  And while films like "Blazing Saddles" and television programs like "All in the Family" are hilarious and important for their own reasons, they don't seem quite as sincere, if that's the right word, as this film, arguably Melvin Van Peebles' best.The late, great Godfrey Cambridge ("The President's Analyst"; "Cotton Comes to Harlem") stars as Jeff Gerber, a middle-class American boor who delights in meaningless competition, keeping up with the Joneses, and chauvinism without consequences at the office -- in short, a fairly typical suburban guy.  His sexless but otherwise happy, narcissistic life has the sort of antiseptic order that probably didn't seem so offensive when Dwight Eisenhower and "Leave It to Beaver" were still more or less fresh in people's minds.  But his world is changed irrevocably when the bigoted but unimpeded Gerber awakens one morning to find himself indisputably no longer white -- and privileged -- but black -- and reviled.  Thus begins his firsthand experiences with the sort of overt and covert racism writers like Ralph Ellison and Chester Himes have described for years and Eddie Murphy would lampoon on "Saturday Night Live," everything from co-workers suddenly no longer saying hello or bothering to make eye contact to being accused of crimes he didn't commit and barred entry to private clubs.The best thing about "Watermelon Man" is how it shows so much of the viciousness of prejudice rather than lectures or preaches, in a film that starts out broadly comedic but ends with the soberness of prophecy.  Key scenes show neighbors turning on him, bribing him in a "golly, no hard feelings" sort of way to leave the neighborhood because his presence will bring property values down; his own wife (Estelle Parsons, shrill as she was on "Roseanne" but with the same proper effect), who prides herself an enlightened liberal until she actually has to take a personal stand on race, deserting him; and his at first seemingly sympathetic doctor, a highly educated and cultured man who thoughtfully concludes the transformation was not the result of an tanning bed accident, as Gerber outrageously supposes, but from having African ancestry -- and then promptly refers his patient to a black physician.  Any man of color who has found himself the exotic flavor of the month will understand Gerber's reaction when the packed-and-stacked Scandinavian bombshell secretary beds the boss she found completely unattractive when he was a member of her own race."Watermelon Man" is not perfect -- at times, the comedy tries too hard, even for the era of postmodern camp  -- but the social satire hits home, then and now.  It's sad, really, that the sentiments at the heart of this film still exist for some people today, after much discussion in the culture, even as it's so obvious how priceless the contributions of African Americans and other people of color have been to the fabric of this great nation.  Populated by a strong cast of character actors, including Howard Caine, SS Major Hochstettler of "Hogan's Heroes" fame, it reminds us how race underpins so much of our mean-spirited treatment of one another, and while the film is not hopeless -- most obvious in Gerber's children, about the only people in the movie who seem unfazed by their father's rebirth as a black man -- the revolutionary message at the end is bittersweet, as Gerber finds resigned solace in the one place America allows him even the suggestion of freedom.  The final shot of the film reminds us that our futures are rooted in the present, and our civilization is measured by either the kindness or the coarseness of how we treat each other.  It may seem trite, but that sentiment is as important today as it was over 40 years ago.

$review_text.: In the wake of the Terry Schiavo controversy, Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar's sensitive and intelligent examination of a quadriplegic's battle for legal euthanasia is a welcome oasis of sanity.  The central character, a quadriplegic named Ramon Sampedro (brilliantly acted by Javier Bardem), is an impressive individual who, despite a rich intellectual and emotional life, desires to die.  All of the supporting characters are beautifully realized, and we can easily relate to his affection for them, as well as his distress at the loss of dignity and privacy that flows from being entirely dependent on them. The film gives a fair hearing to the characters who, either because they love him, or for religious and moral reasons, disagree with his goal, but ultimately argues that "living is a right, not an obligation."  Despite the depressing subject matter, the film was visually beautiful and a pleasure to watch.

$REVIEW.: This 'L'Orfeo' from a 1997 production of the Netherlands Opera has much to recommend it. It has a marvelous cast of singers, including perhaps the best Orfeo I've ever seen/heard in tenor John Mark Ainsley. The single set is very plain except for the round pool of water upstage. It represents, of course, in Act III, the River Styx. Much of the rest of the time it is either invisible, because of the exceedingly skillful lighting by Jean Kalman, or used for various symbolic purposes; the stage is often in darkness, a contrast with high-key lighting on the singers. Costumes are stylized robes in rich colors and fabrics. 'L'Orfeo' is, of course, an opera in which there is not much action, and stage director Pierre Audi has devised a good deal of action, particularly with the chorus, but also with the principals, that keeps them in motion much of the time. Visually this is interesting, even if the movements are often unmotivated by the characters' emotions or the sung text. In a sense this is a feast for the eyes as well as for the ears.As for the musical presentation, it could hardly be bettered. 'L'Orfeo' presents significant musical challenges just in its realization because Monteverdi's score is so sparse in its specifications for instrumentation, harmonies and so on. This is a subtle realization by Stephen Stubbs, the musical director, and indeed he spends several pages in the DVD's booklet explaining some of his choices. He also speaks at length about this in the informative 'extra', a twenty minute documentary made during rehearsals for the production. The instrumental group is comprised of Tragicomedia  (strings) and Concerto Palatino (brass), two ensembles well known in the arena of baroque music.There is not a single weak singer (or actor, for that matter) in the production. Ainsley is an excellent singer in all repertoire he has essayed, but seems particularly so here. His long scene, 'Possente spirto', in Act III where he is trying to coax Charon to allow him into Hades to rescue and bring back to Earth his beloved Euridice,  contains some of the most far-ranging virtuosic singing one will ever encounter in early opera, and Ainsley does it beautifully. It might also be pointed out that the scene's  instrumental accompaniment (primarily organ and chitarrone) is varied meaningfully by interjections by other instruments -- violins, cornets, harp in all possible combinations -- to great effect.Outstanding among the other singers are Juanita Lascarro as Euridice, Brigitte Balleys as La Messagiera, the impish tenor Russell Smythe as one of the Shepherds (and also as Apollo), countertenors David Cordier and Michael Chance as La Musica and La Speranza respectively, the appropriately cavernous-voiced basso Mario Luperi (what a voice!) as Charon, the glorious contralto Bernarda Fink as Proserpine. Also of note are bass Jean-Paul Fouch&eacute;court as a Shepherd (and also as Echo), bass Dean Robinson as another Shepherd (and as Pluto). The cast is also notable for its general physical attractiveness.There are a couple of other 'Orfeos' on DVD and this one, in my opinion, is the best musically and certainly the most visually effective, if a bit stylized (be warned, if that bothers you). I recommend it without reservation.2 DVDs; TT=140 minutes; sung in Italian with subtitles in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Dutch; LPCM StereoScott Morrison

$REVIEW.: This movie is an insult to merely bad comedies. Gee, another movie with a fast-talking, potty-mouthed, black guy (hello Eddie Murphy) who, because it's perfectly fine in ultra-lib, pc Hollyweird, calls Charlie Sheen (and everyone else who is not Black) a host of nasty, racially-oriented names. The movie is a mess. Let's see. The protagonist (Tucker) plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop-killer, is chased around  by cops and the bad guys. The McGuffin is a sack of diamonds. Sheen is supposed to be a co-star, but like most of his other movies, he sleepwalks through it. Clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for Tucker. The sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along. First "screenwriter":" Hey Bob, what will we have Tucker do next? Hey I know, let's have a car chase and have him call some people some names" Second "screenwriter" "Hey, great idea Fred, I sure don't have any ideas".  Apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a rip-off of Murphy the Trickster flicks. Basically the plot is Tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name. If that's your idea of humor, I pity you.

$review_text.: Graduating characters from sketches on Saturday Night Live to a feature-length movie is not new; but the timing was fascinating for the big-screen reprise of the family from the planet Remulak.Released in 1993, it seemed like the period of comedic relevance had passed by Beldar (Dan Akyroyd), Prymaat (Jane Curtin) and Connie (Michelle Burke). But armed with a neat movie tie-in with Subway, cameo appearances by many past SNL cast members and a script heavy in cartoonish skits, Coneheads was clearly pointed in the direction of a fun romp.Michael McKean and David Spade are the stumbling and bumbling antagonists, in their roles as officials of Immigration and Naturalization Services. There is a good dossage of special effects, but the monster, Garthok, steals the show in all of its low-grade madness.The main characters may have lost a bit of their edge from SNL, but that isn't the point; Coneheads keeps it light with laughs, while not taking itself too seriously.

$review_text.: Nimrod Antal's impressive directorial debut KONTROLL takes place entirely in the cavernous Budapest subway system and it doesn't take long (about 5 minutes) to feel the weight and dreariness of the place pressing down on you

 By time the film was over I had to go outside and sit by the pond for awhile (those frogs are crazy!).The Budapest subway is run on the honor system with only a handful of "controllers" to walk around randomly checking for tickets


 Bulcsu is a controller; he also never leaves the subway


 At night when his coworkers leave and go to their homes, Bulcsu sneaks off and hides in the dark corners

 KONTROLL is about his life and the Kafka-like quality it has taken on
 Example: people are mysteriously falling in front of the trains Bulcsu thinks it is a serial killer, but nobody but him has ever seen the killer


 Is there really a killer?  Did Bulcsu really see him or was it his imagination or maybe Bulcsu is the killer?  And why is that owl following him around?By the end I really had no idea what the purpose of it all was since I had more questions than I had answers, but I didn't mind because I had fun the entire way

 I especially enjoyed the scenes of the controllers chasing the non-ticket holders


 Running into walls, knocking people to the ground, breaking stuff they caused more damage and chaos then if they just let the people go


 It's almost like if Charles Bukowski worked at the subway...Wow!...that would have made a great story!I can't wait to see what Antal has in store for us next.

$REVIEW.: My main reason for watching this film was that it is a remake of a film I had failed to respond to 40 years ago. The first version of The Haunting seemed to me stilted and just a little silly. However I seemed to be in very much a minority in taking this view, so I gave the new version a try during the dead zone between Christmas and the new year. I found it just about worth watching. The effects are goodish, but we have been there before with Poltergeist, and in the meantime there has been a very similar film about somewhere called Hell House (this one takes place in Hill House) and I experienced a strong sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. The acting is only good average. Lili Taylor as Nell has the most opportunities and she acquits herself quite well. Catherine Zeta-Jones has - how can one put it? - considerable presence but still gives a fairly run-of-the-mill performance, and the film is really a terrible waste of Neeson. Apart from anything else, his American accent goes to pieces when he shouts. Far and away the best thing is the sets. The interiors are fine gothic efforts, but the building itself was what fascinated me most. I was too slow to spot whether it was Harlaxton Manor, which I recall from another film which I have forgotten in every other respect, but it was from the same general area, and if that part of England  contains more than one building like this it looks like somewhere worth visiting.3 stars mainly because this is the season of good will.

 This show could do both serious sci-fi drama or undemanding kids entertainment,  but I don't think it managed to get either one right here
 Even the high-camp Pertwee era, which was aimed straight at the kids, was usually much better than this
 It is entertaining in its way, but despite being full of action and event, I thought it really went nowhere and didn't take an interesting route getting there.I could really pick it apart, but I won't bother


 If you're a Doctor Who fan,  you're probably familiar with it enough to know whether you want to buy it
 But if you're not,  I'd definitely reccomend you pick up something else first


 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was an amazing TV show,  but precious little in this story will give you any idea why

 Save this one for later.

$REVIEW.: This starts out with what might be the perfect 50's era adolescent nightmare - a fourteen year old boy is dropped (dumped) by his mother in the care of her elderly (old coot) uncles... no phone... no tv... with nothing but gardening for "fun".  Add to that the fact that the uncle's (played by Michael Caine and Robert Duvall) preferred method of fishing relies on the use of shotguns.  The same shotguns provide a not so friendly reception for any traveling salesmen that might drive past the numerous signs of warning along the dirt road leading to their farmhouse.Caine and Duvall are two brothers that have returned to Texas from a 40 year absence of mystery and adventure, reputedly with a vast fortune obtained through (take your pick) chicanery, theft, deception or worse.  Eccentrics with a capital "E", all we know about them for sure is that they have an indeterminate amount of money, an independent nature and little use for the rest of the modern world.  Some people might criticize Caine's attempt at a Texas twang, however what would you expect from a native Texan that's spent the previous 40 years in Morocco, Kenya and other parts unknown?Haley Joel Osment plays "the kid" who is torn between issues of abandonment,  confusion (who are these bizarre old men really?), curiosity (where is their money and how much is there?), and pure wonder (can their stories be true in any way?).  Kyra Sedgwick is his mother, who quickly telescopes her real priorities by beginning every letter or converstation with "how are you doing, have you found the money yet?"Secondhand Lions (yes, there is some substance behind the title), didn't seem to get the attention that it deserved during it's theatrical release, and I hope that it finds a larger following in the more forgiving market of DVD and video.  It's a very enjoyable comedy that will appeal to everyone in the family, a little overly sentimental in some respects; a lot outlandish in others, but it makes for great light entertainment!

$review_text.: Sure, this is a [parody] of 'My Dinner With Andre' but you don't need to have seen that to enjoy this comedy.  Kaufman is in rare form and 'Classy' Freddy Blassie is one of a kind. His stories that randomly start and stop are extra funny.  For instance he talks about a Middle Eastern sheik who killed 10,000 men with his bare hands and then stops midway through the story.  This is not just for Kaufman fans. At it's heart, it's a classic back and forth between two dear friends.

$REVIEW.: THE POLICE, EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE: VIDEO COLLECTION is a prime example of what a video collection should have

When I say that is this has all of there videos [for the exceptions for the other video versions of &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Can't Stand Losing You$Q]

I did enjoy the bonus material
The coolest special feature was &quot;Police in Montserrat&quot; documentary {if own or going to own this I highly recommend you watch this]
The audio mix is odd[if you own just a tv, then agian its probely me] though cause I don't own a surround system 


Overall it is a great DVD and a must buy.

It didn't have big names among the lead actors, but I would have figured that Hanks' name alone could've sold people on seeing this one.It's a nice movie.  Not Oscar-worthy, not gripping, but it keeps you entertained the entire time.  You quickly become attached to the characters, you care about their success, and the story gets you there quickly.

$review_text.: Graham Chapman was, I believe, the most deranged and probably funniest of all the Pythons, and this DVD, though occasionally marred by technical shortcomings, showcases his amazing sense of humor perfectly. These presentations were taken from various live speaking events at US college campuses in 1988. The first two thirds of the DVD is material that is largely a series of recollections and reminiscences some of which involve Monty Python, and some of which do not.The breadth of the material is staggering, but my favorite recollections involve his participation in a group called the "Dangerous Sports Club" which sponsored insane activities like hang gliding above active volcanoes, catapult-related events, and downhill skiing whilst attached to inappropriate objects, in Graham's case a "wretched" wooden Italian gondola appropriated from a local restaurant and containing Graham, a dubious member of the aristocracy, and an inappropriate club mascot in boxer shorts. This event gave rise to the DVD title, as it apparently was a real "brown trouser job."The last third of the DVD is devoted to questions and answers, and Graham really delivers with outstanding spontaneity and wit. The audience asked interesting questions, and the answers were both funny and insightful.Any fan of Graham Chapman, Monty Python, or humor in general will love this DVD. I give it five stars for some of the funniest comedy material ever released on DVD.

$review_text.: As a teenager I was very fond of comics, later my passion declined but I still pick up some classics as Harold Foster's "Prince Valiant", Hugo Pratt's "Corto Maltes" or the Argentinean Hector Oesterheld "El Eternauta" and enjoy them. So I'm not immune to this kind of products.Some years ago I've seen part of Enki Bilal's "Nikopol trilogy" and was seduced by it's depurate drawing, soft colors and strange characters.Still I bought this DVD without realizing it was based on that story. Just thinking it was a sci-fi flick.I was gratefully surprised when recognized Bilal's iconography transported unchanged to the big screen.The mix of live actors with animated characters gives the movie an enjoyable "special taste". I recon I'm not very exigent as to the quality of CG animation and techno-boost fireworks. I simply enjoy the visuals as they are.The story is no simple, but usually movies derivate from comic books aren't.In year 2095 a strange pyramid is stationed over NYC. From there Horus (an Egyptian god) emerges in search of a human body to possess.  Unfortunately the unwilling host of this godly presence, if incompatible, is doom to death.After some failures Horus is finally able to find his "receptor". At that moment the second divine quest starts. Possessed Nikopol is forced to find and seduce mysterious Jill Bioskop.From here on cops, monsters, tycoons, politicians, aliens, cyborgs and the rest romp frantically chasing each other in earnest!Charlotte Rampling as Dr. Turner is accurate and as gorgeous as she was at "Zardoz" (1974). Linda Hardy (Miss France 1992) is giving her firsts steps as actress as blue blooded, blue haired Jill while young veteran Thomas Kretschmann  ("The Downfall", "The Pianist" and  "U-571") gives a full stamina characterization of rebellious Nikopol.Bilal's drawings and imagery are a visual pleasure that deserve to be seenI give this movie big thumb up!Reviewed by Max Yofre.

$REVIEW.: Eugene O'Neill's eight-scene drama, THE EMPEROR JONES had four brief theatrical runs between Nov. '20 and Jan. '27. A first revival (the only one Paul Robeson starred in), was performed 28 times between 2/11 and mid-March of 1925. It was coupled with a one-act play called THE DREAMY KID.The motion picture version has long been in the public domain. Most home video dubs are from unrestored 16mm TV broadcast films, thus condition is rarely better than average and often sub-par.A somewhat creaky film that's best remembered for Robeson's towering performance as Brutus Jones, also appearing in cameo are one-half of the tap dancing Nicholas Bros. (Harold), Billie Holiday and 'Moms' Mabley. The story is that of an imprisoned murderer who kills a guard, escapes and flees to a Caribbean island, where he soon becomes that small country's imperial majesty..Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.4) The Emperor Jones (1933) - Paul Robeson/Dudley Digges/Frank H. Wilson/Fredi Washington/Ruby Elzy/George Haymid Stamper (uncredited: Harold Nicholas/Billie Holiday/'Moms' Mabley/Rex Ingram)

$review_text.: American Beauty, this chilling yet humorous look at the typical American family trapped in the world of suburbia.  The movie is all about appearances, "In order to be successful one must project an image of success at all times."  That is probably one of the overall themes of the movie.  Many of the characters find success to be something all their own through validation of themselves or from another, and you see how their belief in that either makes them better or tears them down.  Sam Mendes, the director of this incredible movie was able to select an awesome cast, including Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Allison Janney, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and Peter Gallagher, all of whom were able to believably bring their character life through just a look or a line.The fantastic movie and incredible cast should be enough to buy this DVD, but it is also loaded with bonus features.  The commentary is wonderful and informative, really breaking down the shots and informing you on what was cut out.  This definitely shows the insightfulness of the director on making sure that there was no unnecessary dialog that would take away from the moment.  Even the behind the scenes featurette was a pleasure to watch.If you haven't seen this movie yet, it is definitely worth you time.  The acting is superb, the quality is excellent and the features are outstanding.  American Beauty deserved all 5 Academy Awards including best picture, because this is truly "Spec-tac-ular".

This film was originally made as "Force to Fight" but was retitled to part of the Bloodfist series when it was released video (Yes, believe it or not this baby was theatrically released). This time we get Don "The Dragon" Wilson being wrongfully accused of a crime and being sent to prison and is "forced to fight" in order to say alive, much like the Van Damne picture Death Warrent. Not a terrible low budget action outing, but far from the best in the overly long series.

$REVIEW.: I am a big fan of Glenn Ford -- whether in westerns or in comedies like this. But, good a Ford is in this movie, the real staring performance is by Marlon Brando as a wily Okanowan who pulls al the right strings to outwit the American occupation forces for the benefit of the Okanowan villagers. I regard Brando's performance as superb and think it helps make this an outstanding movie. However, many people have been offended that Brando's role wasn't given to an oriental actor. If you share this view, avoid this movie. If this doesn't bother you, I think you'll find The Teahouse of the August Moon to be a real classic --one of the best, and funniest, post World War II movies ever made.

$REVIEW.: This movie should be missed.A sad comment to have to make regarding a normally more skilled director.This was meant to be a serious, paranoid horror/sci-fi film. But, in this film, the acting and the script are shockingly bad...the lines of the film and the performances have this odd, UNINTENTIONAL slapstick/goofball style to them that glaringly doesnt fit. I am not sure what Shamalayan was going for with that, but it very much did NOT work. The silliness of the way the characters act in various scenes is in direct contrast to the supposed nationwide terror the characters are supposedly fleeing from. Awkward scenes and attempts at humour here and there arent funny, just awkward, because the entire script is so bad it's hard to tell what's an intentional joke and what isnt.For the high budget, interesting concept, and excellent cinematography this movie has, the acting from leads Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel is really bad and uninterested...(only John Leguizamo escapes relatively well in this film, he does the most decent job in the movie, even though he is only in it for a short time)And the other smaller roles in the film (especially the soldier that runs up, says some stuff, and then yells "Cheese and Crackers!")....Awful!!  The actors themselves seemed to hate the film, and this DOES come across in watching it, no matter how hard they try to play their roles)-especially true for Zooey Deschanel...Wahlberg seems perplexed in how to do this movie, he tries hard, but Deschanel does very little.Shymalayan's films do not rely on special effects and CGI monsters to display the horror of situations. His earlier films were famous for having more IMPLIED horror than shown horror. For that reason, his films have leaned heavily on the ACTORS to imply the correct tone for the film, and to show the EFFECTS of the horror through acting skills. Sixth Sense and Signs were very good examples of this. But, when the acting and script itself falls flat in a Shamalayan film, there's nothing else to run the film, and the movie, sadly, collapses.Ultimately, this is a study in seeing a great director crash and burn with a film. Seeing that this was written, produced, and directed by Shyamalan, the buck stops there. He always insists on complete creative control in his movies, and, sadly, when they crash and burn as bad as this one, he takes the blame.This movie ranks down there with "Boogeyman" as one of the worst "horror/sci fi" films of the last 5 years. I strongly hope Shamalayan can come back, but he needs to take a break for a couple of years and get his bearings again. This film was, sadly, an epic failure.Sorry...It isnt worth buying on DVD.I rented it...for FREE...and I still dont want to ever see it again.Just go watch "Signs" if you havent seen it...the same type of film, but done 20 times better.

$REVIEW.: When grizzly cub Wahb's mother and sister are killed by the Colonel, a local rancher, the Colonel's Cree Indian foreman, Moki, tries to help his "brother bear" by taking him far out into the wilderness and away from the humans invading his land. Little Wahb still struggles, of course, growing up without his family; no one to teach him how to survive, hibernate, or anything else. He manages, however, and grows into a true king of grizzlies. That makes no difference to the Colonel though, when Wahb returns years later to unintentionally wreak havoc and frighten his men and animals. Wahb's only chance at survival again lies in the decisions made by Moki in his struggle to balance emotions and responsibilities to his heritage and to his career.In the tradition of Disney True-Life Adventures and animal stories, 1970's "King of the Grizzlies" is a true Disney treasure featuring legendary Disney animal-film narrator Winston Hibler (for the other Disney animal-film narration legend, Rex Allen, try "Charlie the Lonesome Cougar"). If you grew up with these sorts of films, either in theaters or on the Disney Channel or Disney anthology series, you already know what a wholesome and relaxing delight they are, great for the whole family to watch together and full of fun, humor, education, and the majestic beauty of nature. "King of the Grizzlies" fits right in with the other Disney animal classics with its story of life as a grizzly and the good and bad that can come from man's interaction with the animal kingdom.Warning: King of the Grizzlies does depict animal death by shooting. Early on, the Colonel shoots at Wahb and his family from a distance, leaving him alone in the world, as I mentioned, and in the middle of the story, three wolves are shot and killed off camera (I did take issue with Moki's complete lack of feeling when killing wolves, my own favorite animal, in contrast to his stress over the killing of bears; then again, his kinship with bears is nicely explained through a Cree creation myth). I mention this because I know personally some folks who just can't watch anything involving animals being hurt/killed, though keep in mind that there is no gore and it is all to reflect the realism of ranching life of the time and necessary to the story too. "King of Grizzlies" is still a wonderful, beautiful film about the man vs. animal territory struggle and learning to live together with mutual respect.Though I still recommend it, the DVD from Disney is, unfortunately, totally bare bones. It has a fullscreen presentation, but I do not know for sure what the proper aspect ratio is, and some Disney films are correctly presented in fullscreen. There IS a bonus to be had if you buy this DVD from the right source while Disney's "Earth" is still in theaters. Currently, some retailers carrying "King of the Grizzlies" offer it with a special sticker on the cover that holds a code for free movie cash (up to 8 dollars for use on a child's ticket; some more expensive Disney DVDs hold the up-to-12 dollars adult ticket movie cash code). However, if I was buying this with the movie cash in mind, I'd buy it in person to make sure the sticker was there. It all depends on where you get it, but this offer won't be good for much longer anyway. I recommend picking up "King of the Grizzlies" on its own merits, because it's just a great film.

$REVIEW.: This movie is ranked in top twenty best films ever made. It is a tribute to Keaton that words matter so little in what must have been a technological marvel for its day. The incredible danger that Keaton and Marian Mack endured while skipping and lurching on top of very real trains and locomotives would not be duplicated by preening stars today. Part of the charm of a story of quest and love, is the danger endured by the hero and heroine against all odds. As in most films of this era, there is a naive quality to romance.  The action however, especially on a big screen is fascinating. How did Keaton think up all the possibilities of locomotive spills and chills?  This film is totally original and has influenced 100's of films that followed.

$review_text.: A complex tragedy that gives the impression of relentless, inevitable fate.  This impression is enhanced by the first moments of the film in which a man is killed and we see the killer 'holed up' in the same hotel room in which he shot his victim.  There are a series of flashbacks in which our protagonist, the killer [played sympathetically by Jean Gabin], reviews the events leading up to the murder.There is love, mendacity, disgust and bottomless jealousy.  The 'heavy', the murdered man, is truly reprehensible degenerate who adds young women to his score like a gun fighter puts notches on his gun.  Fate, uncontrolled temper and the police play their inevitable roles.  Francoise, our pitiful killer, is far more grieved about revelations about the girl he loved than he is about the killing, itself.Then again, what if Francoise acted impulsively on a disgusting lie?

$review_text.: Stanley Kubrick takes you on a journey a little different than the novel, and if you're a stickler for the book, this movie might be a bit disappointing.  However, if you like the horror like Nicholson can deliver, this is a must-see.  His line "Here's Johnny," as he is trying to tear down the bathroom door, is not only classic Nicholson, but it captures the character's slow crawl down to evil.  There's much in this movie which deviates from the novel, but it doesn't take away from it either.  Again, a classic film, and it's highly recommended!!!
$SUMMARY.: Not a bad adaptation.

$REVIEW.: this is a sequel film and shows.  The plot was good and the special affects were excellent.  But the character development was lacking.  The movie had one point, to explain why Thor returned to Earth and to return Loki to a position to make problems.  the next movie with these character will define if this was a good sequel or not.

$REVIEW.: Granted, almost any film looks better in 1080p, but everything in this movie jumps out like never before.  Sound and picture quality are amazing.  Yes, the majority of the film was made with CGI and special effects considered to be primitive by today's standards, but there is a surprising amount of detail obscured by previous releases.  Supplemental features are also well done.  There's some worthwhile material included from previous releases and newer materials that are very interesting if you get into the 'making of' documentaries and things of that sort.  Considering the lengths cast and crew went to to make this film look like nothing previously seen, it does shine an interesting light on the amount of time and elbow grease that went into making this film as stunning as it is.Granted, if you've never seen this movie before don't expect this to top other films (sci-fi and otherwise) in terms of 'greatest movie ever.'  There are details than can easily be nitpicked in terms of plot, dialogue, and so forth. However, for sheer entertainment value this can't be beat, especially with Amazon's prices.

I am a real fan and this DVD provides a record of a life theatrical performance of the Doyle Carte Opera Company, the original company devoted to Gilbert and Sullivan.

But the descriptions/explanations do not give it justice.It was a short lived show that brought a smile to a lot of people's faces.The wonderful thing about this DVD is that is has the entire show. The show while only lasted for one season, I think got wrapped up very nicely. The story has an ending (I wont ruin it for those who didnt see it) where I am satisfied and aren't thinking "wait...

$review_text.: Palm Springs, California, is famous as a desert town that offers the good life - lush green golf courses, sunny skies, and wealthy inhabitants. Just down the road is the Salton Sea, an inland lake that briefly prospered before going bust. In "Plagues and Pleasures on the Salton Sea," maverick filmmaker John Waters examines those who choose to live among the ruins surrounding the Sea.Not surprisingly, the area's residents are often outside the mainstream. One character is a Hungarian immigrant who calls himself Hunky Daddy; he drinks beer, curses, and pulls down his pants while on camera. Another man likes to stand nude by the side of the road while promoting various causes.Waters explores the tensions between old and new residents. The long-time residents are often elderly white people who cannot afford to live anywhere else. (It's fairly cheap to live in a near-ghost town). The newcomers are often minorities who are trying to escape California's cities.A third theme is the tension those who want to re-develop the area and the environmental problems that increasingly plague the Sea as California's population grows. There seem to be few easy solutions to the problems plaguing the Salton Sea.Though I enjoyed the film, there are a few drawbacks. Sometimes the film is a bit unfocused. In one scene, for instance, several new residents comment on the area. Unfortunately, people speak over each other, so the scene is very difficult for the viewer to follow. Other scenes simply don't go anywhere.In spite of my quibbles, I recommend "Plagues and Pleasures..." for those who are searching for something different.

$REVIEW.: "The Way, Way Back" is both a realistic depiction of the awkwardness of the early teen years and a natural comedy. One is amused throughout the films over the situations in which the characters find themselves. There is an extroverted neighbor and a water park manager who refuses to go his age who provide much amusing entertainment. There are memorable side characters such as a wise cracking employee who is afraid of germs. These characters are well portrayed and are believable. Many will be able identify with the characters and feel for them. The movie has a great arc for the teenagers that is honest and refreshing, as well as an important arc for a scared mother, This is truly one of the funniest movies around, with an excellent script and superb acting.

Her cueing is right on the money so you always know what's coming up next.  And I felt just the right amount of tiredness in my body after doing this workout.  It's such a nice way to work out and to break a sweat.  There are quite a few parts where she does faster moves like "skater" and it's just great.  Highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys new ways to workout while using basic dance/pilates moves.

I was weary about how a zombie would fall in love with a girl, but the way they explained it in the movie made a lot of sense and gave this movie something that other zombie movies lack. I'm not typically a fan of zombie related things, but this was a good segue into the genre and had some pretty funny moments as well. I would recommend this :)

$review_text.: Wow! I can not believe anyone could have anything good to say about this lame movie!? I must say that being a pre-teen when the original film was released, I saw this film many times at the theater. Who could resist this adventure? The young boy is one of the heroes and we get to ooggle  Pamela Sue Martin in hot pants! In the original film when Roddy McDowell ("Ackers") and Shelly Winters ("Bel") die we feel genuinely sad. When Jack Albertson ("Manny") discovers his wife of 50 years has suffered a heart attack after saving the preacher from a horrible under water death, we feel empathy for him (Albertson). I am a big fan of the original, though I must admit it has lost some steam as I've grown older. First I want to point out I have a very nice home theater with a 10 foot screen. I watched a HD version of the new film, so it had everything going for it. The remake doesn't take any time to develop the characters, so nobody cares that their lives are in danger or if they die! There is no build up to the giant wave, so there is no tension when it capsizes the ship! I also thought the special effects were NOT all that big an upgrade, if at all!  This is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen! All the acters including the stars phoned in the performances and the action sequences did not equal the sweat inducing "swim along the rope under water" sequence of the original. A complete waste of time and money! If you are going to try to remake a movie,this is the way NOT TO DO IT!

$REVIEW.: I am not going to comment on the series (although from me it gets three stars for various reasons) but I felt compelled to review the actual quality of the packaging and DVD setup because they are severely lacking.These sets look attractive, but the packaging is very flimsy.  These are plastic cases that do not actually close, rather they just &#34;fold&#34; over, which is odd and they fall apart after moderate use because you basically have to lightly pry them open and physically hold them open in order to remove the disc--well that only lasts so long before the plastic simply snaps apart unless you only take the discs out a few times ever.There is no content information on the packaging.  Yes, we know which season we are watching because it is noted on the cover, but there are no episodes listed, no indication which episodes are on which disc beyond &#34;Episodes 1-6.&#34;  So, unless you truly have these memorized then plan on having to refer to the internet to figure out where the episodes fall, or, be prepared to put the disc in, wait for it to load and then for the menu to come up in order to find out what's on that disc.  This is no big deal if you're just watching the series in order once but if you are already familiar with the series and like certain episodes more than others or prefer certain time frames of the show then it's nice to be able to look at the DVD case to see which episodes are included on that particular disc.The worst offense of these sets--in my opinion--is that there is NO &#34;play all&#34; feature.  I personally find this to be ridiculous, especially when we are dealing with a series that has such very short episodes.  And not only that but you have to hit &#34;play&#34; at least twice before the episode plays because they offer to play with commentary or without commentary and you have to actually select &#34;episodes&#34; from the main menu to get to that screen.  So, you have to go through all of that to play one episode and in the meantime the menus themselves are annoying as all hell, filled with non-stop background theme music and random bits of dialogue from the show which will play for all eternity if you let it.I never thought I would be complaining about things that sound so silly, but after purchasing three seasons of the show and dealing with the general nuisance of the overly elaborate menus and functions of the DVDs I had to say it!I would probably skip these and go for the newer sets if they are available.  Maybe some of these super annoying issues have been resolved?

$REVIEW.: The sense of smell has never be so compelling and so wonderfully put on film then it has in "Perfume - Story of a Murderer".The movie takes place in Paris 300 years ago and tells the story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, played by Ben Whishaw, who is an orphan with the best sense of smell in the world.Jean's goal in life is to make a perfume that captures the esseance of smell and never goes faint, a perfume so potent that people loose track of all reality.  Jean's life gets twisted and darkened has he looks and searches for the sents needed to complet is masterpice and what's portrayed is a man's spiral in a hateful but unknowing place.Perfume wraps yourself with its world and its personlity so effectivley, that the ending will slap you in the face.  The preformaces of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille by Ben Whishaw is a wonder to watch...you see a little Hannibl Lector in him.The DVD does the story justice and I can't give it enough praise without sounding like a rambling idiot anymore.  For a uniniqe vewing experince everyone must check this movie out.

$REVIEW.: I hesitated between a four and a five star review for this series mostly because it's a first season (and only) that leaves many open ends and questions unanswered... frustrating, really. However, the entertainment value of the series is such that it deserves the 5 stars.I never watched it on CBS when it was out and I got to hear, read actually - about it here on amazon. The vast majority of rave reviews convinced me I should give it a try. No regret there; it was a hit for me in spite of the fact that, to my opinion, it should have been an HBO project to allow a little more "edge" and more wits at all levels. But for network TV, it's top quality.Alex O'Loughlin (portraying the yummy "anti-vampire" vampire Mick Saint John who tries to do good in spite of feeling bad for what he is) gives the top of the performances in the show, with Shannyn Sossamon (as the beautiful vampire "ex" Coraline) and Jason Dohring (as vampire friend Josef Kostan)sharing some really interesting parts in the series. I'm not crazy about Sophia Myles' choice for Beth, the human love interest of the sexy vampire Mick but it's not because she's not good; it's just that I would have expected a little something more from her, physically speaking. As attractive -  and a very good actress - as Myles is, I would have expected her character Beth to be a little more special, unique. Her Beth is a little too "girl next door" for me. Anyway, Myles and O'Loughlin work well together and their interaction is more romantic than when Mick and Morgan/Coraline share a scene. Then it is plain hot and burning! The contrast is clear, thanks to the casting.As often in network television, the rythm of each episode may seem a little formulaic at times but the characters' development make the story as much as the story itself.As a whole the blend of action and romance is very well-balanced, and there's is enough humor too to keep the series entertaining and addictive enough to watch it more than once. I did!

$review_text.: Another clinker from the 1960's vault of Joan Crawford films. & of course, Joan being a true star really gives it her all in this truly bad low-budget film about 2 silly teenagers who make a prank call to the wrong guy (John Ireland). Her brief (& co-starring) appearance steals the show & as usual is a riot. The subplot involves Joan playing the desperate, manipulating, man-hungry middle aged next door neighbor--who is obsessed w/ snagging John Ireland even AFTER she finds out he's a murderer! The scenes w/ her & John Ireland together where she can barely surpress her jealous rage over his dead ex-girlfriend had me chuckling. Dressed in what looks like a cocktail dress & a mini-chandellier around her neck, she looks & sounds as if perhaps there really was alcohol in those drinks she was making.The climax comes when she confronts one of the teen-aged girls grabbing her by the hair, calling her a "tramp" & ripping her to shreds screaming "GET OUTTA HERE!..." over & over again.  you'll die laughing. The rest of the film has some suspenseful moments thanks to the menacing John Ireland, but the corny soundtrack music took what little scariness this film had going for it away. At times it sounded like background music on an episode of "The Flintstones". I'm sure this may have been scary stuff for pre-teens in the 60's but today its just another hilariously campy Joan Crawford movie.& i'm giving this film ***** simply because it completely fulfilled my need for camp--Joan Crawford style.

$REVIEW.: Just in case if you do not know, Rebellion along with Insurrextion are WWF's PPV events for England. This is another good PPV from the Ivasion period. It carried over some storylines and feuds from No Mercy to the Survivor Series event. The two World Title matches are very good and the under-card isn't so bad either.Steel Cage Match for the IC TitleEdge (C) vs. ChristianThis feud played off pretty well. But this match certainly didn't live up to their Ladder Match from No Mercy. Some good spots with the cage. No blood in this one but still good. And the ending is something we haven't seen yet since. 4/5Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Hurricane HelmsI was really impressed with this match. It started out slow but picked up as the match progressed. Some very good counters and reversals towards the end and this match played out to be pretty decent. 3/5Big Show vs. DDPA very short match. DDP's run after the Invasion and Summerslam PPVs went really bad in my opinion. And this match was really weak. These two had better in their old WCW days. 2/5Elimination Tag Team Match for the WCW Tag Team TitlesHardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz (C) vs. APAThe PPV picks up again here. After the APA got eliminated, the Hardys and Dudleys put on a very good tag match. A table gets introduced but doesn't get used. Still a pretty good tag team match up. 3.5/5William Regal vs. TajiriA very good mat based and ground based match up. Regal looked to be in very good shape here. A very good match. 4/5WCW Heavyweight TitleChris Jericho (C) vs. Kurt AngleThis match came about after Angle defected just a week earlier. This match went very good with both men suplexing and slamming each other. To include a little nice brawl on the outside. Angle is very good as a heel and him and Jericho meshed in very well with each other. Just a solid wrestling match. 5/5Divas Tag Team Match with Trish Stratus as the Special RefereeLita and Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler and Mighty MollyI found this match not good at all. Even with Trish as the special ref. This match just didn't do it for me. 1.5/5WWF TitleThe Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (C)Great match but doesn't quite equal to their classic from Wrestlemania earlier in the year. This match got taken almost everywhere. It would even get a little brutal. This was a good back and forth confrontation from these two great rivals. A very good match showing for the WWF Title. 5/5The Extra's arent so bad either. They hold two very good matches and also Kurt Angle defecting to the Alliance.WCW Heavyweight Title From RAW 11.5.01The Rock vs. Chris Jericho (C)Another good match showing from these two for the WCW Title. Not as good as from their No Mercy encounter but still very good nevertheless. This match seemed very personal. It has a good table spot and some blood too. And the after match assault to The Rock added more as well. 4.5/5Smackdown 11.8.01Undertaker vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kurt AngleAnother good match right here. Austin and Angle had just previously took out Kane the past RAW. And Taker was here for revenge and he gave Austin and Angle a run for their money. Good match and watch out for Austin stunning Angle. 3.5/5I recommend purchasing Rebellion '01. The two World Title matches are great and the extra's make up for the decent mid-card.

 I didn't care for this movie however.1)  The actor does not look like Glenn at all in my opinion, which I find distracting.2)  Its very disjointed, and a lot of the components offer very little insight about Glenn or his life


 One scene was Glenn simply going into a restaurant and listening to other people's conversations


 Big deal, this is not interesting


 I know this was supposed to offer a subtle insight into his personality, but it's boring and it comes across as pretentious filmmaking


 Another example; Glenn is listening to a record with a cleaning lady

 Thats it
Why is this interesting?  Someone could film my uncle in Wal Mart, but would you care?  Hey, look...My Uncle Carl is buying batteries

 Now he is putting his change in his pocket

 How utterly profound....In my opinion, you will learn and understand more about Glenn Gould by listening to his music than watching this lackluster, uneventful movie.

Perhaps if I didn't have any other barre/ballet workout dvds, I would have enjoyed it more.Also there were times when she said I should feel it in the glute area but I could barely feel anything in the glutes.  I wasn't sure if I was doing some of the moves correctly.  I didn't think she explained some of the barre work very well.  However, I could have been doing the moves correctly, but they were not challenging enough for me.  I'm just not sure.  I can always feel the burn with all of my other barre workouts, and I have a lot of them by different instructors.

$REVIEW.: This mystical comedy is one of my favorite movies.  The story is simple and fantastic.  A bumbling angel (played by Edward Everett Horton) removes a boxer from his body before his death, and when the body is cremated the angel's boss, Mr. Jordan, has to find the boxer a new body.Robert Montgomery is the boxer, Evelyn Keyes is his luminous love interest, and Rita Johnson, who has the more interesting female role, is the villianess as only 1940s Hollywood could depict (Gale Sondergaard, anyone?) while John Emery (once married to Tallulah Bankhead) is her evil lover.Robert Montgomery could handle evil well, too, but in this movie he does what he does best and plays the hero with perfect comic timing.  Suavity in this case is left to Claude Raines as the supernatural Mr Jordan who makes sure we all wind up at the right destination after we die. James Gleason is Montgomery's befuddled manager, who's helped out by that epitome of befuddlement, Donald McBride, who played a policeman so often I'm surprised that the LA force didn't offer him retirement.Someone mentioned that Montgomery is not that well known as an actor and that's probably because he retired in the early 1950s to coach Eisenhower, the first President who widely utilized TV.  After a job helping the President of the United States, I guess Montgomery felt that being a mere actor was beneath him, which is too bad because he was very good at what he did.  But he gave us his lovely daughter, Elizabeth, who enchanted us for years with her own supernatural doings as Tabitha in "Bewitched."

$review_text.: After the Shogun mini series aired on American tv in the late '70s there became an American fascination with all things Japanese. In the early '80s  Hollywood was eager to cash in on the Ninja boom and there were a tons of Samurai/Ninja movies ranging from decent to downright awful. The Challenge however deserves some praise while other films of the genre don't.The Challenge was directed my John Frankenheimer (Ronin, The French Connection II) and is a little known gem of the "Samurai movie boom" in America. The story opens with a broke boxer named Rick (Scott Glenn) who is paid to smuggle a sword back into Osaka, Japan. Little does he know that he has just involved himself in a family feud battling over the ownership of a pair of swords. Toshiro Mifune plays the patriarch of a large family who live in "the good, traditional way" while his rival, bad brother, Atsuo Nakamura, heads a multi national company . Both brothers are determined to get their hands on each others swords to reunite the pair of blades.One has to admire Frankenheimer for his quick cinematography of Japan. The busses, the street shots and the long views could be just about anywhere in Japan and at times it seems like he deliberately tried to avoid any signs that might give away the actual location of each shot. However all the quick shots leave us nothing to desire about Japan. Granted, filming in Japan in the '80s cost a small fortune and the red tape to even get filming permission to film anywhere must have been a nightmare.  Even for those who live in Japan might  have a very hard time finding any visible landmarks in the movie....save Sanjo Station in Kyoto, Itami Airport and the Kyoto International visitors center....where the main battle takes place.The Challenge refreshingly doesn't spend a lot of time dealing with the stereotypical "east vs. west" and the oh so tired "the foreign fish out of water in Japan". Scott Glenn does a great job of playing a naive foreigner who knows nothing about his new world, but doesn't go over the top by over analyzing every little Japanese custom as an odd opposite of "superior" Western culture. Unlike other films of the same genre, there isn't any deep, Japanese Samurai ,philosophy that most films of the era try to enthrall Western viewers with. Yes, it does deal with family honor and the ever popular Western fantasy view that all Japanese have this over emotional, all powerful, love of the Japanese sword. The idea that a family in 1980's Kyoto dressing in traditional clothing and practicing martial arts every waking moment of every day waiting for a battle is....well...laughable and that security guards carry machine guns is beyond realistic.The only famous Japanese actors are Toshiro Mifune who is legendary and Atsuo Nakamura, who is only really known in Japan and I am pretty sure his English was dubbed for this film. Donna Kei Benz plays the love interest Akiko, who seems really miscast and her acting is awkward. The best line in the whole film is by the Henchman Ando, played by Calvin Jung, who says "I don't understand these people (japanese) either. Every time I come here I understand less and less about them".Why this movie isn't on DVD is beyond me. There are old video copies being sold for ridiculous prices for this rare, out of print film. I got mine in Japan after a long, seemingly endless search. Luckily, there were English subtitles in the few places where Japanese is spoken. Why this film was ever re-released as "Sword of the Ninja" is slightly insane....since there are NO Ninja in the film and the title alone does the film a discredit.

$review_text.: The film of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; was awaited with much anticipation after all the tremendous publicity given to Barbra Streisand following her stunning portrayal of Fanny Brice in the hit Broadway show
Streisand won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in the film (but had to share the award with Katharine Hepburn).The young Fanny Brice (Barbra Streisand) desperately wants to be a success in show business and after a shaky start thinks she has made it when she lands a part in a big Ziegfeld show


Ziegfeld (Walter Pidgeon) and Fanny clash over various matters connected with the show due to her strong personality but her talent shines through and she eventually becomes a major star

She meets gambler Nicky Arnstein (Omar Sharif) and falls madly in love with him

Unfortunately, his gambling habits get him in trouble with the police causing Fanny much sadness and anguish

However, she manages to overcome these problems to concentrate on her career and becomes a big Broadway star.The film was directed by the legendary William Wyler and produced by Ray Stark (who was in fact Fanny Brice's son-in-law!)


The film had a superior supporting cast including Kay Medford (repeating her Broadway role as Rose Brice), Anne Francis (Georgia James), Lee Allen (Eddie Ryan), Gerald Mohr (Branca), and Frank Faylen as Keeney.Some favourite lines from the film:Barbra Streisand (to her reflection in theatre mirror): &quot;Hello, gorgeous&quot;.Lee Allen (to Streisand): &quot;Are you sure you can rollerskate?&quot;


Streisand: &quot;Can I rollerskate?&quot;.Streisand (to Walter Pidgeon): &quot;O.K


you win


You don't win fair but you win!&quot;.Due to the success of &quot;Funny Girl&quot; a sequel was made (in 1975) called &quot;Funny Lady&quot; with Streisand again and James Caan as Billy Rose


 Omar Sharif also returned in a cameo role but the sequel was not as popular as the original


&quot;Funny Girl&quot; was one of those rare occasions when the perfect part came along with the perfect actress to play it

One of the last of the great Hollywood musicals

$review_text.: Ingmar Bergman's "Persona" is a fascinating exploration of personal individualism

 It is a troubling reminder that an identity that takes a lifetime to form can be lost instantly in a moment of weakness.Actress Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) mysteriously stops speaking in the middle of a performance and remains mute from that point on
 Her psychiatrist assigns a young nurse named Alma (Bibi Andersson) to look after her and sends them both to a secluded house

 The two women have a cordial relationship at the outset but tensions arise when Alma begins to feel psychologically overcome by Elisabeth."Persona" is Bergman's most experimental film


 Ideas and questions on the subject of identity and cinema itself are symbolized by an intriguing opening montage and unexpected breaks in the narrative

 Complementing the film's unique structure are the stunning performances turned in by Ullmann and Andersson

 There is passion and emotion in all of their scenes and they are particularly impressive in the sequence where they discuss Elisabeth's child

 "Persona" is one of those films that refuses to conform to filmmaking convention and the end result is a work of cinema that is not only memorable but special as well.

$REVIEW.: Robert (Dylan McDermott) wakes up in a freezer in the very first scene. The Russian mafia has him held there and they want their money. Robert claims he is a mechanic and offers his wallet, which is missing, and to take them to an ATM. The Russians are not amused. He has their money, the Russians don't make mistakes.Robert is very chipper for a guy facing death. He is beat up and cold tortured, but nothing overly severe. You can figure out the first twist, and there are more to follow, none were really unexpected. Just as the film slows up, it introduces another character or twist keeping you engaged, but not overly entertained.It isn't bad for a movie where 99% is filmed in one room as one might expect. The action/thriller aspect is more old school action/drama/thriller. Normally this is something I would love, except the characters didn't give me a convincing performance, nor was Robert a decent protagonist whose character we got to know late...i.e. it failed to hook me.Makes for a rental.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.

$REVIEW.: Jerry Bruckheimer has taken American History and made it entertaining. Who ever thought the Libery Bell could be so much fun. The movie is more or less a grand tour of the revoltionary war  with a little Templar/Freemason Lore thrown in for good measure. Anyone who sees an anti-Christian conspiracy in this "movie" needs to check his roof for Black Helicopters. Than again anyone who thinks this is a Christian Nation needs to stop handing out Freemason tracs (dollar bills). Those who think this is the real history have alot reading ahead of them. ("I think thats a good thing.")Simply put:National Treasure is to "The Age of Reason" what Raider of the Lost Ark was to World War 2.So enjoy the ride!

$REVIEW.: Nine years ago was Jason's supposed "Final Friday", but the folks at New Line decided otherwise, and thus we have Jason X: the tenth entry in the long running slasher series


 Though this installment spent nearly two years on the shelf, and it seems many a death scene was either re-filmed or edited, Jason X is still loads of fun due to the fact that writer Todd Farmer, director Jim Isaac, and the cast take none of this seriously
 After finding no way to kill Jason (the film seems to ignore anything that happened in Jason Goes to Hell), military autorities and scientists decide to cryogenically freeze the immortal killer, and naturally the blood starts to flow


 Jason (Kane Hodder returns once again) and the beautiful Lexa Doig (TV's Andromeda) are both frozen together and awaken in the year 2455 by a team of students on a training mission through space
 Jason gets loose once again, goes on one of his good 'ol killing sprees, and gets a new look as well
 Some other horror franchises that take a chapter to space have not fared well at all, examples are Hellraiser: Bloodline and Leprechaun in Space, but Jason X is a fun thrill ride

 Jason X is nowhere as gorey or violent as some of the other films in the series, and like I said before it seems some things were left on the cutting room floor


 The acting is pretty crummy for the most part, which has come to be expected by now with this series, but for the most part Jason X is fun when not taking itself seriously, but those who do take this film seriously (which will most likely be the same people that took From Dusk Till Dawn seriously) will absolutely hate it


 All in all, Jason X may not be the best in the series, but it is a good addition, and for the most part delivers the goods

 The DVD features are worth noting as well: the commentary by Jim Isaac, writer Todd Farmer, and producer Noel Cunningham is nice, while the original documentary The Many Lives of Jason Voorhees is very insightful and is a treat for older horror fans

 Look for acclaimed director David Cronenberg in an ill-fated cameo in the beginning of the film.

$REVIEW.: Baz Luhrmann's production of Shakespeare's classic work, &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; is set in modern-day gang warfare as opposed to interfamilial squabbles.  There were some things about this that worked well for me, e.g., Jon Leguizamo's absolutely vicious Tybalt in cowboy boots. However, I found Leonardo diCaprio entirely insipid as Romeo.  Claire Danes acquitted herself well as Juliet despite the poor pairing with diCaprio.  I particularly enjoyed the masqued ball scene, taking place at a prom instead of a familial ball.  For the most part, there is more to like in the Zeffirelli production with Len Whiting and Olivia Hussey ... but this version of the &quot;star-crossed lovers&quot; may bring the tale to younger audiences in a more effective fashion.

$REVIEW.: You take it (mostly) outdoors, cast great-looking actors to lip-synch to professionalsingers' wonderful voices, and film as if it were a movie rather than an opera. Thus,the action is in motion all the time. The little scene between Igor and Ovlur in thePolovtsian camp is shot with Igor walking along a riverbank and Ovlur oaring alongin a little boat. The Khan's aria right after takes place as he and Igor tour throughthe encampment. These are just a few of the wonderful touches used to make theperformance realistic rather than &#34;operatic.&#34; Sometimes an aria is used as avoiceover, thoughts in a character's head. But when they have to lip-synch, theactors do surprisingly well. You really have the feeling that you've been droppeddown into ancient Rus, yet the music is very well performed. Some of it is cut,admittedly, but you seldom get a complete Prince Igor, and even when you do,it's an adulterated edition. Let's hope the Metropolitan Opera tapes its new andauthentic version.

$REVIEW.: Viewed: 10/12Rate: 810/12: Congratulations, Cleopatra, for holding the distinction of being the longest movie I've ever seen in my life. Anyway...was that movie long or what? Although Cleopatra was universally panned by critics and film goers alike, it was not that bad. Elizabeth Taylor was not that bad either. However, like it or not, I had to compare the movie to the likes of Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia. The biggest issue I had with the film was the lack of emotional attachment I developed for the characters. I meant, why did I care if the principal characters are dead? What did I know about them? Rome was in danger? Who cared? Rome eventually fell. Who cares? The people of Rome were important? Who cared? Egypt got its own power? Who cared? I didn't care about all of that stuff. What's so different about Lawrence of Arabia was the meaning of the desert to Lawrence. How extraordinary was it for a common Englishman to lead an Arab revolution for the Arabs. Take Ben-Hur. It was a triumph to overcome the impossible odds to show what kind of a character that Judah Ben-Hur showed. But in Cleopatra, where was all of that? I didn't see it. In any case, it's still a better Roman picture than Quo Vadis which was seriously outdated. It deserved the Oscar for Best Cinematography because it was spectacular. Yet they didn't try to show more of the desert? That's hard to believe. Probably the winning feature of the cinematography was Elizabeth Taylor's breasts. Every scene had her showing lots of cleavage and rock-hard shapely form. In short, that's probably what the movie Cleopatra was all about. As for the historical side of it, most of it as shown in Cleopatra was throughly false, and she was a plain looking woman with a witch's nose. For the final scene, I had thought that Elizabeth Taylor would be naked from waist above, as the legend goes for her suicide, prior to being bitten by an asp. Alas, nope. As for the acting performances by the cast, uh...somewhat too theatrical. Tone it down a bit. Finally, as for the script, more sensibility was needed. All in all, Cleopatra is an endurance marathon on the eyes.
$SUMMARY.: Title the Movie as Cleobreastra.

$review_text.: Philipp (Matthias Freihol) is a High school literary teacher in East Berlin who falls in love with I assume another teacher who he accidently runs into and gives a bloody nose to. They start a relationship and move into together; one night Philipp visits a gay bay and meet Matthias (Dirk Kummer) a 19 year old (both actors are good looking too)at a Berlin gay bar; Philipp gets wasted and is carried home to Phillip's other apartment in lived in before he started the relationship with his girfriend by Matthias, who spend the night; Philipp is so drunk is remembers little of the affair and runs into Matthias again while waiting to purchase tickets for a show. They reminise about the night before and get reaquainted; all of this behind his girlfriends back.The rest of the movie finds Philipp torn between his girlfriend and Matthias; tring to have his cake and eat it to (no pun intended) until all three meet at another event and Philipps finds his life falling apart at all ends; his mother finds out he's gay the girlfriend-wife spurns him and matthias is divestated by Philipps double life.There is no happy ending here and I have found that foreign films are more true to life more indepth and multipli-dimensional than there  U.S. counterparts.This is a dark and sad film which I believe many of us gay people can relate to at least so aspect of it.

$review_text.: This is a wonderful high intensity workout.  If you haven't tried Turbo Jam, you are in for a real workout treat!  Chalene takes what might be boring punch and kick moves and turns them into exciting ab core exercises that really get you motivated and working out!  This is one of my favorite workout DVD's in the Turbo collection.  She has some wonderful combination moves that are great and get you pumped.  I've been doing Turbo Jam for a short while but lost weight and inches (read my review on Turbo Jam Fat Blaster).  This is a great workout DVD.  The moves are designed to flow with your own natural movement and there is a team member on all the DVD's, Mindy, who always does the modified version for those who need a little boost.  For the rest of us, these moves can be pumped higher and hotter to get the best cardio workout.  If you don't know about Chalene and her infectious smile and truly inspirational workout spirit, you are missing out on a great thing! This DVD has about six minutes of warm up which starts off hot and moves into the rest of its 48 minutes (total) of hard workout.  The end of the DVD has some tubular toning, just a couple of minutes or so. The tube thing is a rubber band with handles to work the deltoids and glutes (butt muscles) to tone.  I think it was a way to introduce the tube idea - I'm not so crazy about it.  (Producers should let her do what she does best and thats pump, punch, kick and jam).  On the other hand, the tubes help you learn balance and coordination which calls for a different use of your muscles.) The DVD ends with about a three minute stretching routine.  I do the tube stuff at the end as part of a cool down anyway. My only personal bias is that I wish they would have lengthened the cardio by a few minutes and dumped the tubular stuff.  You will however get your total cardio workout and will feel it at the end.  It's a great routine by design, it is a total workout and one of my absolute best in my collection.  The DVD is about 50 minutes long in total workout time.
$SUMMARY.: One of my absolute favorite Turbo Jam DVD!

$REVIEW.: OK, lately I've been experiencing my video entertainment through DVD only, with the exception of a few shows, so I have only seen Ep.III and Clone Wars (vol
1 & 2) on DVD
 As you may know, the ROTS DVD came out in November, with Clone Wars Vol


2 coming out in December, thus leaving some of us scratching our heads as to how events come to be at the start of ROTS


 Well, as you may know, Clone Wars Vol
2 was the story of the opening text crawl of ROTS
 With that said, however, I have never seen these episodes until now...after having seen ROTS on DVD in November.So, I must say that AFTER having seen ROTS, I thought it was brilliant on how Vol


2 fills in the gaps and explains the lead up to ROTS

 From the upgrade of the Clone Troopers, to the use of the X-wing fighter-type Clone fighters, to the training in the Jedi ways of General Grievous, to the capture of a few Jedi and Chancellor Palpatine.Oh, also a comment on the animation style

 I seemed to notice a bit more 3D modeling with this volume than with the first


 I could be wrong, but from all the shots of the Jedi Fighters to the Droid fighters, I loved the way they would twist and turn and maintain their proper look perspective-wise
 This is one aspect that really takes me out of a lot of animated shows when their vehicles, mainly, don't look right as they manuever.

$review_text.: I haven't reviewed a purchase in years, but this gem from long-ago deserves it.It resembles Dreamgirls only superficially.  Sparkle was about, and made with, unbroken gritty realism, as a film of the early 1970s (think The French Connection)...which makes the glamour and polish of the musical numbers even more effective.  Lonette McKee is a mesmerizing performer; smooth and sensuous onstage; either in relaxed command or intense to the point of intimidating, offstage.  (No one bursts into song offstage.)  Irene Cara matures subtly from a timid teenager backing up her stunning and confident elder sister into a poised and accomplished star in her own right.  Philip Michael Thomas gets to show more life than he ever did later on Miami Vice.  Dorian Harewood nails a tricky role with the early talent that caught Stanley Kubrick's notice for Full Metal Jacket.As a middle-aged suburban classical-music lover, I'm not certain whether Curtis Mayfield's songs are too far ahead of the period, but they're so good you won't care.The direction is pointed with well-chosen details:  a scene opens on a shot of Satin's two-tone wingtips...at a cockfight; a nightspot favored by African-Americans has an overdressed platinum blonde who, like her dog, never speaks but never leaves; the singing trio's mother, smooth-tempered and congenial no matter WHAT goes down, watches proudly from the wings of Carnegie Hall, against a background of stage electricians working their enormous circuit boards...My wife vaguely remembered the film's release, and this particular evening had counted on watching something else...but thanked me for this.  And while I didn't fall in love with anyone in it, as I had with Jennifer Hudson, I praise it for delivering on it's modest ambitions without schmaltz or sentiment or wishing away the pain of what several characters endured, and did not all survive.

I have looked for this movie for years, but could never remember the name of it until I ran across it on Amazon! They say you can never go back...........well I guess in some ways that is true. As I remembered this movie as being more scarey then it really is. Now is seems kind of silly and tame to me, but as a 10 year old...it gave me some Big Thrills! I still do recommend it as it is different then most 50's Science Fiction movies. Not really Great Big....special effects, but still a novel idea and I remember being very scared of that BIG BIRD...swoping down and grabbing me on my way back home after the movies.

$REVIEW.: H.G. Wells was not a believer in the good nature of human beings, and his science fiction was more often than not an exploration of our darker nature.  It was refreshing to me, as a sci-fi fan, that the movie retained these elements.  There is no fight here.  Humanity is being exterminated by powerful aliens, it's hopeless, and there's little to do but run.  This movie captures these claustrophobic feelings quite well.Cruise, in the midst of his well-publicized media freak-out/rant, puts on IMO the best performance of his career, here.. The alien machines are (FINALLY) the great lumbering tripods they were meant to be, and the scenes of destruction and panic are some of the best I've seen (btw- this film really needs to be seen in 5.1 - the sound is an underappreciated star of this movie).If you're a fan of the book, I recommend this.  If you're looking for gung-ho heroics, you'll probably want to pass.

$REVIEW.: SPOILER WARNING! MAJOR SPOILERS!The entertaining and sometimes quite corny British series "Torchwood" takes a decidedly darker turn in this third season miniseries, known as "Torchwood: Children of Earth".A bizarre alien race known only as 456 demands that humanity turn over millions of children to them. Apparently, human children emit a special chemical which the aliens use as a recreational drug! It also turns out that the British government have helped the aliens abduct children in the past. To stop the truth from leaking out, home office secretary John Frobisher sends out a hit squad to kill everyone who knows about the previous alien encounter, including Torchwood leader Jack Harkness. But, as avid "Torchwood" fans know, Captain Jack can't die. Various ingenious ways of getting rid of him fails, and he is soon back to take on both the 456 and the officials who betrayed him.The governments of Britain, the United States and other nations turn out to be evil, spineless or both, and agree to turn over the children to the bizarre aliens. The military promptly rounds up undesirable kids from bad neighbourhoods. The operation ends only at the last possible moment, as the hit squad that wanted Captain Jack dead suddenly turns coat and starts co-operating with Torchwood instead. Jack then forces the 456 to withdraw by turning one of the aliens' own signals against them. Unfortunately, the victory comes at a terrible price. Several of the main characters end up dead, the Torchwood Institute is in shambles, and Jack Harkness leaves Earth. The whole thing cries out for a sequel. Indeed, a fourth season of "Torchwood" is said to be in preparation."Torchwood: Children of Earth" is one of the better science fiction dramas I've seen. Every episode has its fair share of excitement, suspense and unexpected twists. The evil Frobisher becomes a tragic hero. The spotless hero Jack turns out to have a dark past. As already mentioned, the black ops people eventually decide to co-operate with the good guys. The revelation that the 456 need the children as a narcotic is suitably disgusting.The only problem with "Children of Earth" is, ironically, that it's *too* good. It doesn't fit very well with the two previous seasons of "Torchwood", with their curious blend of entertainment, weird depressions and bisexuality. "Children of Earth" is too dark, too pessimistic and just too serious.  It's not clear how the series will develop from now on, but it will be difficult to go back to the good old days of Weewils, cannibals and giant mayflies from outer space! "Torchwood" started out as a "Doctor Who" spin off, but it seems to have ended up in a very different universe.But perhaps that's how it should be. It will be interesting to see what the people behind this series will come up with next...

$review_text.: I specifically wanted the Director's Cut of this movie.  In its &#34;public&#34; version, it is a fairly good movie, well-acted and well produced.  The &#34;public&#34; version, however, cuts out the entire back story of the female lead, making her a rather two-dimensional although beautiful woman who wants to be a Queen.  However, it is her back story that shows her as a strong, intelligent woman who does not simply want to be a queen for vanity but must be queen in order to protect her son's future.  What she, as a mother, is willing to do and does for her son, that is what makes her an equal match for the &#34;blacksmith&#34; defender of Jerusalem, so well-played by Orlando Bloom.  No wonder the Director himself regretted that the commercial version cut out that part of the story.  It's what makes this, in my opinion, not just a fairly good movie but a great movie.  And reasonably accurate, historically.

$REVIEW.: This film is one of my all time Clint Eastwood favorites.  He plays the kind of semi bad guy that you root for.  You almost hope he pulls off the big heist and gets away with it and lives happily ever after because he is Clint.  If you can accept the fact that this plot borders on total fantasy, could never happen and defies logic time and time again, you will enjoy the scenario.  Lennie Niehaus' film score is perfect in creating the eery and sinister mood throughout the film and Clint's own playing of the piano theme is beautiful and haunting.  Gene Hackman as the president is truly the screen's best on screen bad guy and Ed Harris is his usual natural and believable self as the "live alone" head detective.  With that being said you must ask yourself: Why and how were the president's trysts unaccounted for by his staff and the media?  When E.G. Marshall's wife was murdered there was apparently no investigation even though he was very prominent.  When Clint met his daughter at the outside cafe the whole area was surrounded by police but apparently Clint didn't see any of them.  When the secret service man was killed in the hospital apparently no questions were asked and no investigation took place and Clint was never a suspect.  When the president presumably committed suicide E.G. Marshall was never suspected even though he was the only witness and no questions were asked why the president fatally stabbed himself at that specific time.  Minor details, right?Toughreviewer

We need to work on developing characters, penning decent scripts, and stop hiding our non-creativity and laziness with tons of blood and action...but don't get me wrong, we love the action, we just want a story to go with it.The cute Laguna Beach kids, the bullies, the stupid blonde girl who can't keep her pants on

I have never in my life seen those characters 150 million times before in a movie, thank you for that


The only thing that saved this movie from being a total joke was of course, the fight scenes and the Predalien, which I thought looked really cool


At least that's one thing they usually get right, the costumes and effects


But I was bored to tears until a little bit before the Hospital scene and on which woke me up a bit.I really hate to be negative, I just want MORE

And it gets so old seeing great characters being rehashed into mediocre movies over and over again.

$review_text.: Having really liked the original, I hoped for this sequel to be outstanding as well.  I was not disappointed.  There is a brand-new flavor and equally original story to this movie as the original.  Doris Roberts continues to just be herself to make the grandmotherly, crafty, supernatural (but only we, the viewers, know it) character known as &#34;Mrs. Miracle&#34; shine.  The casting feels just as authentic as in the original.  Those 3 factors--the story, Doris Roberts' role as Mrs. Miracle, and the rest of the cast--are what made the first one a 5-star movie for me.  This, the sequel, has the same director, Michael Scott.  The male and female leads, Jewel Staite and Eric Johnson, have excellent chemistry together.  Rather unusually, there are almost no problems in their developing romance, every issue revolving around their families and jobs.  There are lots of laughs and lots of unexpected plot twists in this one, and I think it has more humor than the first--and it's not just from the manipulations of Mrs. Miracle this time.  The last quarter of the movie brings resolution to every plot strand in really brilliant and touching ways.  I also strongly appreciate that it embraces Jesus as the source of Christmas, which no one ought to be ashamed of, and this film isn't ashamed of.  I strongly recommend this movie!

Lovecraft and I've seen all of the other Lovecraft-inspired films Stuart Gordon has made (Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon) so I knew exactly what contect in which this flick ought to be viewed.This is a marginally faithful retelling of the short story of the same name


Like the other Lovecraft films by Gordon, it has been placed in a distinctly modern setting


If you've read the original tale, you'll understand why they omitted the name of the witch's familiar and if you've seen the other films mentioned here, you will probably not be suprised to know that they modified the tale to appeal to schlock-horror fans
I wish they had explored the background of "the Witch" to any degree at all and the "library scene" was poorly executed (though with the trademark corniness that makes you laugh out loud)


This is pretty much all the criticism I have for this flick

$REVIEW.: Being a fan of the haunted house genre, when I first saw the teaser trailer in the theater, I was extremely excited. That excitement didn't last long. This movie was a ridiculous remake of one of the classic haunted house films, and I'd never recommend this. Special effects are not scarry. What you don't see but know is there is what will make people remember the story and come back time and time again. Rent or buy the original instead, it's much creepier.
$review_summary.: Watch the original instead

$REVIEW.: There's not too much I can add to the stellar reviews of this DVD.  All I can say is that you can play this for any kid and they'll be begging you to let them join the band.  A great party DVD especially if there are musicians around although anyone will enjoy it.  Outstanding sound from two of my all-time favorite groups!Also, check out both lead singers recent solo albums: "Soul on Jazz" by Philip Bailey and "Subtlety & Passion" by Robert Lamm.  Bailey creates a mellow CD and  Lamm's CD is especially superb featuring most of the members of Chicago with horns on ALL the cuts, great writing and Lamm's magical voice.  A better-than-Chicago delight!

$review_text.: Im sorry but I have to say that this movie, may just be the worst movie ever made. Okay maybe not the worst movie but still an extremly boring one. Honestly, I feel asleep for 5 minutes while waching this movie. Good actors is the only thing this movie has going for it. The actual acting isn't as good. But anyways thirteen ghosts is based on an uncle who is willing to let his brother and his kids live at his house filled with ghosts whom he is studying. It's based on a movie made a while back (can't remember what year) but that movie was supposedly a good movie (I've never seen it.) For most of my friends this movie did alot for them. But this movie did absolutley nothing for me - didnt scare, didnt have anything new or exciting. Maybe the old movie was better but the antics in this movie just bored me. Id rather watch a Paul Walker movie, yes you heard me right Paul Walker - one of the worst actors I've ever seen.If you want to laugh at supposed to be scary parts wondering if that part was supoosed to be scary, and if you want to fall asleep at the sametime then this is your movie. But If you wanna watch something thats actually scary try The Sixth Sense, The Excorsist, Hannibal, Silence Of The Lambs or The Ring

As this documentary points out, Harryhausen's style of animation has been superseded by computers.  However, no one's claiming it's been surpassed or even equaled.

$REVIEW.: ...Jim Carrey shows real talent in a welcome serious role.  Some of the reviews that I have read disturb me.  They seem to imply that the sentiments are phoney and that it should have been a Capra type satire......A small town that lost 60 of its sons in the war.  Exceptionally bad luck for such a small place... like what happened to the community of Deer Island, Maine during the Civil War.  The impact of that can tear the heart out of a community... especially after the war when it turns out that all evil has *not* been vanquished in the world... Growing up in the 1950s, I knew many families that had lost sons, fathers, brothers in WWII... "Gold Star" flags still showed in windows... the number of stars represented the number of sons lost (blue stars showed sons serving)...The apparent return of the most distinguished of the boys thought to be dead... nine years later... gives the town a shot of hope and enthusiasm... The HUAC plot is disposable compared to the unfolding of the story in the community.  Martin Landau is splendid... and his "son's" return in his waning days justifies any incorrect identification.

$REVIEW.: How can you turn a murder mystery thriller, a clever-premised  world wide global best-seller into a boring dud of a movie? That's the real mystery here.  This piece of film fiction is NOT a lecture or a documentary it just feels like one.By taking itself way too seriously, the filmmaking conspirators destroyed the fun of the ride.The audacious premise may be blasphemy to some and heresy to others.  But the real unforgivable sin here is that the movie is boring.Even Tom Hanks said it's just a movie about a bunch of "religious hooey."  But the sin of the filmmakers is that by trying to stick to the letter of the book and not the mood, wrecked the story and it got off track on its way to becoming a movie -- and the film derailed.That said, the movie version of Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code" works best for those who buy into the hoopla and publicity and still think the book is factual and not clever fiction.  It's kind of like those great speculative recreations on the History Channel.Brian Grazer is an astute producer who often has his finger on the pop culture pulse and Ron Howard is a gifted director, but here they were unable -- or afraid -- to boldly guide Akiva Goldsman's screenplay away from the novel and into a blueprint that would make the breathless page-turner a disturbing, edge-of-your-seat thriller.If you're interested in the dark side of the Catholic Church, check out the non-fiction books "The Bad Popes" by E.R. Chamberlin and "In God's Name" by David Yallop.  Or Google the Spanish Inquisition.  Dan Brown's fiction pales in comparison to historical reality.

$review_text.: Steven Spielberg's misunderstood Sci Fi masterpiece is one of the director's most ambitious projects and one of his most amazing films. Taken from the Brian Aldiss short story "Supertoys Last All Summer Long", A.I ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE was originally a project for legendary director Stanley Kubrick to direct. Most Sci Fi fans and Kubrick devotees wanted to see Kubrick direct the film, as it is perfectly aligned to his other films, notably 2001: A Space Odyssey.But with Kubrick's passing, the only director on the planet capable of taking on the colossal project was Mr. Spielberg.The elaborated story taken from Aldiss tale is about a robot (Or "Mecha") child named David (Haley Joel Osment), who is programmed to love. But when his adoptive parents find themselves at a loss of what to do when their real son recovers from a coma, David is abandoned into the world with the supertoy "Teddy". David's journey takes him to the violent, nihilistic Flesh Fair where he meets the smooth-talking Gigolo Joe, played brilliantly by Jude Law (Gattaca, Existenz). From there they travel to the futuristic Rouge City, accompanied by the waltz from Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss and begin their epic journey to find the Blue Fairy. John Williams' etheral score for the film is perhaps not as meorable as his most famous work, but it still moves the film forward emotionally.The jarring switches from futuristic suburbia to the mecha-hating world may not sit well with some viewers, and the ending, admittedly is overly-sentimental. But it is a compelling story, and one that's a must-see on the big screen.Despite the combined brilliance of the main actors, Spielberg's masterful direction and touching homages to Kubrick, the film was a commercial failure and critics were apparently put off with the film's sentimentality (Hence the shameful Academy snubs). Whether American audiences found the film too cerebral in comparison to brainless Hollywood rubbish, or the cryptic marketing campaign of posters and trailers backfired or whether people were expecting an E.T-like tale of a heart-warming adventure (And were disappointed), is debatable. But the fact remains it is a brilliant film and a must-have for Spielberg fans.One of the more impressive Spielberg DVDs, this 2 Disc Collector's Edition is lacking a Director's Commentary (Spielberg apparently likes the audience to have their own opinion) and hours of reported deleted scenes, but it makes up for it with the doco on the first disc "Making A.I", directed by prolific documentarian Laurent Bouzerau. Included on disc 2 are a series of featurettes with Spielberg talking about developing the vision of A.I. Industrial Light and Magic group on the film's special effects and Stan Winston explains how the robots were created. There's also a featurette on the sound effects and orchestral score for the film, several theatrical trailers and production design photos. Essential.

All five seasons of Here's Lucy are on DVD now and season six should be coming soon.The Lucy Show and all of Lucy's other sitcoms are funnier and better than most sitcoms on the air today, so I am very pleased that CBS and Paramount are releasing them on DVD.I can hardly wait until this comes out!

Excellent sci-fi thriller centered in Boston and Harvard University. Joshua Jackson is terrific as the skeptical son of his legally insane Ph.D. father who experiments with fringe science (w/196 IQ) and Anna Torv as the beautiful yet conflicted FBI agent who rounds out this unlikely investigative trio.Immersive sci-fi definitely worth the investment of time to watch. 5 stars!

$review_text.: HBO have at long last, decided to release this on DVD and thank goodness. The Wire is undoubtedly the best TV around these days since "Homicide: Life on the Street". No surprise then, I guess that the same man (David Simon) had/has a big hand in both series.Unlike most crime/cop shows that have a beginning, middle and end in the one episode, the story here is spread over the entire series. We're seeing stuff that kicked off in Season 1 still developing in Season 3. Some viewers find this challenging - this certainly isn't a show you can watch while cooking dinner or chatting to your buddies on the phone. It's sad that ratings have dropped though because if you give the show the undivided attention it deserves and focus on the story, complex as it is, the rewards are truly immense.After the drama on the docks that was the main focus of Season 2, Season 3 takes it back to the streets where we most like it. The Baltimore drug wars rage on, with Avon Barksdale, played by Wood Harris, out of jail to find his territory of corners under threat from young & ruthless upstart, Marlo, played utterly convincingly by Jamie Hector. Stringer Bell has held things down while Avon's been away but his methods have been questionable, to put things mildly. Stringer gets his comeuppance this season though and as much as I hated the character - and admired Idris Elba for playing it so well - I honestly didn't see his comeuppance coming in the way it eventually did. Scorching scriptwriting!The police are desperately trying to keep up. Major "Bunny" Colvin, played by Robert Wisdom, comes up with the 'brilliant' idea of creating a 'safe zone' for drug sale and use in the city and this area gets dubbed Amsterdam. The plan seems to work - the rest of the city suddenly becomes a haven - but Colvin keeps the project from his superiors. The results are disastrous, for him and for the city.Meanwhile, the detail is back on the hunt and as we watch them chase their tails, the questions left hanging in the air are what is this so-called war on drugs about, exactly? And who is winning?In the background, meanwhile, there's scheming, wrangling and backstabbing in the corridors of the city political powers. Unlike the stuff on "The West Wing" this is the kind of politics I can get into and this is a story that is going to run and run.Like any TV show, this one has its 'stars' but this is truly an ensemble performance. Everyone, whether it's by playing a starring role, a recurring role, bit part or even an extra, gets to contribute a crucial part of the jigsaw that makes up the big picture.Still, I must mention some of my favourite performers. Apart from those already mentioned, they include: Lance Reddick, an actor with the ability to convey more with a single look than most actors can with a whole minute of dialogue, as Lieutenant Daniels; Dominick West, who plays Detective Jimmy McNutly, a cop who races to save the world while his own life crumbles around him; Sonja Sohn, who plays Detective Kima Greggs, McNulty's loyal partner, who realises she's not as ready for a life of domesticity with her girlfriend and their baby as she had originally thought; Andre Royo, who plays Bubbles the 'co-operative' drug fiend with heart; Michael K. Williams, who plays Omar the gay gangster with a shotgun - something I never thought I'd see on TV in my lifetime; Frankie Faison and John Doman who play Commissioner Burrell and Deputy Commissioner Rawls respectively (for some reason, neither fails to make me laugh out loud with every line they deliver); Michael Hyatt, who plays Brianna Barksdale, mother of D'Angelo (who was murdered in Season 2) and sister to kingpin Avon; and last but by no means least, the 'dynamic' duo Detectives Herc and Carver, played wonderfully by Dominick Lombardozzi and (the beautiful) Seth Gilliam respectively.And then there's Chad L. Coleman as Dennis "Cutty" Wise, the ex-con who finds he no longer has the stomach for the streets. He turns to volunteering, running a youth boxing gym. Here's an actor to look out for and he brings an intensity to his role that I found mesmerising. I hope we get to see more of him in future Seasons.This is a totally believable drama with cracking dialogue and nary a cliche or stereotype to be seen. The reactions to the show, both positive and negative just go to show how a gritty and realistic drama series can hit home.This is a must for any connoisseur of mature and thought provoking TV. This is one show that takes a long, unapologetic and uncompromising look at an underclass we would all prefer to ignore and thus, while it's not always pretty, it is always riveting. If you don't have seasons 1 & 2, I recommend you get them now. This one of very few shows I am able to watch over and over and not get bored, learning and appreciating something new each time. I am placing my pre-order for Season 3 forthwith!

$REVIEW.: This is a great family film.I love the way it covers the topic of kami, it's very unique.The animation and art is beautiful, spectacularly done. The music is fitting, and the dialogue is great. The characters are so lively and imaginative. The whole movie is full of life and spirit.There is a little bit of romance, some things you might chuckle at, perhaps a bit of surprise, and certainly lots of adventure in this fantasy film. I really enjoy the concept of the importance of your name as a part of your identity and remembering who you are.My son is three years old and cannot read (we watched it in Japanese) and even he was fascinated!Now, I'm not sure this movie is quite as amazing as Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke, but it is certainly worth watching twice (or more), and is interesting and eye-catching.It may be a bit predictable, as it is a "Happily ever after" type of movie, but it is WAY better than and less predictable than any Disney movie out there, and has such a curious plot! I recommend it to anyone. Enjoy!

one of the downsides of living in a country still slavering over so-called British history and a bit limited when it comes to other history

Anyway, I found this disc to be excellent, I initially thought it was a travesty what happened but then found myself questioning that after a few days, suggesting that Mr Redford has hit the mark by sparking thought rather than laying down an opinion.I love the American Revolution so look forward to some other things that the American Film company has in the works!!Thoroughly recommended!!

$review_text.: Director Luis Bunuel exposes the hypocrisy of the elite in this surreal comedy


 A group of friends are constantly frustrated in their attempts to sit down to dinner, that fundamental social function at which etiquette and manners are of supreme importance and unpleasant truths are politely avoided


 After these people are frustrated in their efforts to observe the social niceties, Bunuel lays bare the corruption in their souls.If you go into this expecting a cohesive narrative, you may be frustrated yourself
 However, if you approach it as a series of surrealistic episodes that often make no logical sense, yet succeed at exposing the hypocrisy of the human animal, you may find yourself laughing (or at least smiling) at the many absurdities on display.

$REVIEW.: A film unabashedly romantic and in love with the concept of "soul mates"


And why not? Is love merely a product of genetic attraction or blind chance? Jaglom accepts the idea of "soul mate" as a premise, indulges in a little mysticism, effectively utilizes an old standard (The White Cliffs of Dover) dripping with nostalgia, and in the process delivers a film that will be revered by those who are believers and reviled by those who remain skeptics

"Paris? How cliche!" or "Paris because it had to be!"  Dana and Sean are soulmates but Dana is engaged to Alex and Sean married to Claire


Both relationships could be described as happily content,  but once Dana and Sean discover each other, being content suddenly seems empty

And so they are confronted with a dilemma: seize the day or turn away


In the film Citizen Kane, a reporter searching for the significance of "Rosebud" to a man that had everything is told thus: "One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off
A white dress she had on
She was carrying a white parasol

I only saw her for one second

She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since, that I haven't thought of that girl." And this coming from an old man! Jaglom asks the question, "What if that girl was that boy's soulmate?" And then the follow up , "Should he have seized the day rather than wonder his whole life about what ifs?"

$review_text.: This 2012 film is a very loose adaptation of various storylines from the cult gothic suspense soap opera DARK SHADOWS (1966-71).  In this, Tim Burton's version, the vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) returns to the ancestral mansion after 200 years locked in a coffin, determined to restore the sagging family fortunes.  There are brief moments of real horror, as well as much crude fish-out-of-water humor as Barnabas tries to get used to life in 1972.  As is usual with Burton, the film is visually quite striking.At one point during the film, Barnabas asks Willie (Jackie Earl Haley), his mentally-enslaved mortal lackey, to dispose of the corpse of one of his victims.  On learning of this tragedy, Willie shrugs it off with: "I never liked the bitch anyway."  As one who had watched the original show, I immediately recalled that this attitude was nothing like that of the original Willie (John Karlen), who was constantly fighting against his master's mind-control, who always tried, in one way or another, to save his master's victims and prevent his killings, and who always grieved deeply when he failed.But my point is not to complain that this film is unfaithful to the old series (though it certainly is).  My point is to explain why it fails on its own terms.  The problem with Willie's attitude here is that it is not just Willie's attitude --it is everybody's.  NOBODY cares that Barnabas is an undead serial murderer.  Not Collins matriarch Elizabeth Stoddard (Michelle Pfeifer); not her teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Moretz); not her 10-year old nephew David (Gulliver McGrath); not live-in psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter); not David's governess Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote).  And it is not as though they don't find out.  The only character who tries to make an issue out of his murders is the evil witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) and she is motivated not by morality, but petty revenge.Even Josette DuPres, who in the original threw herself off a cliff to escape Barnabas and avoid becoming like him, has no such motive here.  Here, she dives off the cliff for entirely different reasons.  Here, Josette's ghost entirely approves of Barnabas, and would like nothing less than to be united with him forever as an immortal undead serial murderer.Are the scriptwriter and director trying to make some kind of ironic point with all this moral obtuseness?  Not as far as I can tell.  They seem merely to project their own attitudes.  Here, Barnabas swears to Elizabeth that he would never harm family.  Unlike the original Barnabas (who for all his fine talk would not have hesitated to murder even little David) he apparently speaks the truth.  The script constantly returns to this theme of family loyalty, a virtue that apparently excuses and justifies all other crimes.  Apparently, we are expected to cheer for and root for Barnabas, even after watching him butcher a half-dozen construction workers and an entire van-full of nice young hippies.  We are then expected to nod with approval as he preaches family values and good parenting to Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller).  This is mafia morality.This is not vampire horror, nor even (primarily) vampire comedy.  It is vampire fantasy.  Burton assumes his audience WANT to become vampires, like Bela Swann in the TWILIGHT series.  But this vampire is no Edward Cullen: a sparkly do-gooder who never takes human blood.  He looks like a corpse (moreso even than the original Barnabas, played with suitable menace by craggy-faced Jonathan Frid) and murders without compunction.  That is why, whether you label it horror or comedy, it simply does not work.  We cannot be scared because there is no-one to root for (except the anonymous victims); we cannot laugh because it is just not funny.The main horror comes from our glimpse into the dark hearts and diseased souls of Tim Burton and Seth Grahame-Smith.  They seriously need their butts kicked.

Today I figured, what the heck; how bad could it be?Wow, is this movie bad!  Johnny Depp and Aaron Eckhart must've needed some extra pocket change when they decided to do this movie.  The writing's bad through and through and actually manages to make Depp look like a bad actor.  At least Eckhart was his usual charming self, even with a terrible script.I kid you not, this is one of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time on!

$review_text.: Aaron Eckhart carries "Thank You for Smoking" with his witty edgy performance.  His teeth are all sunshine and front words that exist in a moral vacuum called the profit motive.  The film satirically highlights how profit motive must be tempered with service motive.  Eckhart is famous for his work with Neil La Bute such as "In the Company of Men."  He has also branched into other films like "Erin Brockovich" & "The Black Dahlia."  He deserved his Best Actor Golden Globe nomination for this film.  His son is played by Cameron Bright who was the creepy reincarnated soul of Nicole Kidman in "Birth" and has also appeared in "X-Men 3" & "Ultraviolet."  Nick's best friends are also lobbyists, Maria Bello ("Assault on Precinct 13" & "A History of Violence") plays Polly Bailey and Saturday Night Live's David Koechner plays Bobby Jay Bliss.  William H. Macy plays a neurotic senator; Robert Duvall is the Captain of tobacco; Sam Elliott's the Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch; and Rob Lowe is the Hollywood super-agent Jeff Megall.  For his first directorial project, Jason Reitman creates a funny, offbeat comedy that certainly twists our moral expectations.  There are plenty of deleted scenes for an excellent special feature.  "Thank You for Smoking" is hilariously drawn.  Enjoy!

$review_text.: If you're a big fan of SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN and have only a peripheral interest in THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY, this is the DVD for you. SANTA looks terrific, and the original name of the penguin (&quot;Topper&quot;) has even been restored on the DVD (for some reason he's &quot;Waddles&quot; in syndication). If, however, you're like me and love both stories, especially if you've been watching LITTLE DRUMMER BOY since it was originally broadcast on the network, you're going to be super disappointed in the quality of that program. Another review mentioned DRUMMER BOY as being &quot;grainy.&quot; &quot;Grainy&quot; is not the word. Although I understand it was made from the original film negative, it looks like they took the worst print copy to make a transfer from. There are white dust flecks all over the print. In some places the sound effects are missing: for instance, before Aaron sings &quot;Why Can't the Animals Smile&quot; there was a lead-in and lead-out of him beating his drum. On the DVD there is big empty silence instead. The noise and jeers of the crowd are also gone. In another spot, a man's voice is reading Greer Garson's narration. The night scenes seem murky; when Aaron comes up to the gates of the town, I remember being able to see the name &quot;Bethlehem&quot; over the gate. The DVD scene is so dark you can't make it out. In short, I'm not tossing out my DRUMMER BOY videotape. If SANTA didn't look so crisp and nice I'd probably get rid of the DVD. Disappointing...sorry, Rankin-Bass.

$REVIEW.: I just want to add to the list of people who got ripped off after purchasing this DVD. The image and sound quality are great but when you are seventy minutes into the film the picture pixilates and becomes unwatchable!!! ARRRRGHHH!!!!!!But, what really burns me is Raro Video's pathetic statement, "Our suggestion is to return your disc for a refund and repurchase the new disc around the first of July." Seriously?????????? How about those of us who bought the DVD a month ago or more and have finally got around to watching it??? Let me tell you, we're not getting a refund.When Anchor Bay released a faulty DVD of Dario Argento's 'Opera,' they posted an address on their site where you could send in the old disc and they would mail you the corrected one. When Panik House released a faulty DVD of `Girl Boss Guerilla' in their amazing Pinky Violence Collection, they did the same thing as Anchor Bay. That was the right thing to do. The audacity of Raro Video placing the onus on the purchaser is ludicrous.Zelda Lazor, what if you can't return your disc? What would be your suggestion?

$REVIEW.: Just read the opening monologue, and you can understand why this polarizing movieis either a strike or a gutter ball.&#34;Way out west there was this fella I wanna tell ya about. Goes by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. See, this Lebowski, he called himself &#34;The Dude&#34;. Now, &#34;Dude&#34; - there's a name no man would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place so darned interestin'. See, they call Los Angeles the &#34;City Of Angels&#34;; but I didn't find it to be that, exactly. But I'll allow it as there are some nice folks there. 'Course I ain't never been to London, and I ain't never seen France. And I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after seeing Los Angeles, and this here story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess I seen somethin' every bit as stupefyin' as you'd seen in any of them other places. And in English, too. So I can die with a smile on my face, without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. Now this here story I'm about to unfold took place in the early '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the I-raqis. I only mention it because sometimes there's a man... I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? Sometimes, there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here - the Dude from Los Angeles. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude. The Dude, from Los Angeles. And even if he's a lazy man - and the Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in all of Los Angeles County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. Sometimes there's a man, sometimes, there's a man. Well, I lost my train of thought here. But... aw, hell. I've done introduced it enough. &#34;

$REVIEW.: I could go into detail about this choice bit of South Korean cinema. I could mention that WAR OF THE ARROWS, set in the 17th century, prefaces the meat of the story with the King's loyal servant and legendary archer being executed on trumped-up charges, and that the archer's young son and daughter subsequently flee and gain sanctuary with their father's old comrade. Thirteen years would elapse, and, in the home of their father's friend, the son and daughter, Nam-yi and Ja-in, grow into young adults.Except that, somewhere in the intervening years, Nam-yi (Hae-il Park) had lost his way. A bowman of some skill, Nam-yi nurses a healthy bump of self-preservation. But as the son of a widely labeled traitor, he lives a wasted life, and disillusionment has set in. WAR OF THE ARROWS (Original title: "Choi-jong-byeong-gi Hwal") goes on to chronicle Nam-yi's fight for redemption. But the thing you need to know most is this: WAR OF THE ARROWS lays down some pretty awesome archery-fu.China's ambitious Qing dynasty and its invasion of Korea's Joseon state fuel Nam-yi's quest for atonement. The brutal attack coincides with the wedding of Nam-yi's sister Ja-in. When Qing troops abduct Ja-in (as well as 500,000 other Korean hostages), Nam-yi, tardy to the scene, embarks on a far-fetched rescue mission, armed only with his father's old bow and a supply of red-fletched arrows.As the Qing forces and their hostages make their way to Manchuria, and as we track Nam-yi's relentless one-man guerrilla warfare, we're treated to several moments of fiendish marksmanship as the traitor's son takes out one enemy soldier after another. If you dig underdog stories, then you can't help but get jazzed when Nam-yi's exhibition of unfailing aim gradually has a demoralizing effect on the Qing troops. Even the Qing's elite cadre of bowmen begins to marvel at this determined sniper dogging their heels. Robin Hood, I think, would approve of Nam-yi who, in the eyes of his enemies, gradually ascend to near mythical status.WAR OF THE ARROWS is an epic historical action film. It keeps you on edge with its well-staged scenes of dazzling bowmanship and the suspenseful cat-and-mouse games enacted between Nam-yi and the Qing's band of select archers. The narrative roots you emotionally, thanks in large part to Hae-il Park's transformative performance, going from disillusioned no-good-nik to selfless hero. Veteran actor Ryu Seung-ryong brings a commanding presence as the warlord heading up the elite Qing archers (I grudgingly liked the guy). Moon Chae-Won has soaked in her props for injecting refreshing backbone and feistiness into Ja-in, a character who doesn't take her abduction lying down. In fact, action-wise, her character would be pivotal in the film's climactic sequence. With its slew of dynamic moments, I think WAR OF THE ARROWS one-ups Russell Crowe's recent take on Robin Hood. I think that director Kim Han-min has managed to breathe fresh life into the bow and arrow picture. And Nam-yi is mesmerizing, both as a conflicted character and a dead-eye marksman who doesn't necessarily have to shoot straight to hit his target. Nock that shaft, Nam-yi, and let it loose crooked if you wish. The effect's the same.

$REVIEW.: This is an excellent Altman movie
Though there is the usual large cast you expect from an Altman movie this one is unique in that despite all the periphery confusion it brings an ever increasing focus on just one character, Dr
T himself
Richard Gere has never been one of my favorite actors but he gives an impeccable and likable performance as an always generous and compassionate gynecologist
His wife played by Farrah Fawcett has a breakdown(and gets naked in a fountain) at the mall early on and spends the entire movie institutionalized


His daughters are played by Tara Reid and Kate Hudson, ones a JFK conspiracy nut and the other a lesbian cheerleader(her lover played by Liv Tyler)

 Dr

T's work life is equally confusing as he treats one hypochondriac after another


Excellent small part by patient Janine Turner

While his wife is in getting treatment he begins an affair with independent golf pro Helen Hunt

In synopsis the movie sounds wacky and it is but it is also a very solid drama

The movie has a backbone and that is Gere

As his perfect life falls away before him he becomes more and more exposed, vulnerable
Lyle Lovetts soundtrack provides a sober running commentary on one man losing control of his life and how he deals with that


 An ending that will blow you away....highly recommended

This is a very confident Altman being experimental in a very interesting way, he's full of insight again

Reminds me of some of his seventies work like 1978's The Wedding, but with firmer directorial control.

$REVIEW.: this movie is the blu ray movie version of the campy 1960's tv show , which fox has YET to put out on dvd


 Which along with the green hornet series have not been put on dvd at all

Which is foolish especially with the new batman movies out there

 I don't personally think that this campy version of batman is the best one out there but it does match the comics of the sixties (the ones being published in that decade)  at least until neal adams and others brought back batman to his darker roots

Even so; this version is at least likeable andbatman and robin are earnest and caring crimefighters even if it is campy.The blu ray print improves over the standard release but like many older movies it doesn't jump out at you in sharpness


That's ok though as it is still cleaned up and nicer than any standard dvd release could ever be.I  hope FINALLY they  put out the series and the green hornet spin off series on standard dvd at least

"Holy batmistakes! It's a crime that they haven't!"  as Robin in this version would say.

$review_text.: From the stories to the picture, Due South season two did the impossible and was even better than the first season! The stories take a lighter note and are at times really funny, and some episodes are very serious and very sad. The writing has improved and it is just perfect. If you are a fan of season one, then you have to get this as well, because it just gets better.

$REVIEW.: As I read the Amazon.com editorial review, I was left wondering if the reviewer had watched the same movie that I had. Silverstones character was not openly gay (which explains why one girl really thought he liked her) and the climax was where it became exposed to everyone. what he did in his "off-school" time was unappologetic sex with random men in a park bathroom. His best friend knew and the sports jock who ends up having an ill fated affair with him, finds out. The movie is decent. It does have clever dialogue and the chemistry between all the cast mates is good. The climax, where he accepts the covetted award, is just awesome. Of course the film has some ups and downs... and it kind of goes down as the relationship between the two leading men starts to crumble under the pressure. Still, an overall appealing movie.

$review_text.: When a celebrated occult novelist is approached by a distressed man seeking his help, he soon finds himself keeping watch over a beautiful teenage nun on the lam from a group of Satanists who want to make her Astaroth's vessel. Keeping her under wraps for two days would seem simple enough, except the leader of the cult, an excommunicated priest named Rayner, has an arsenal of supernatural tricks up his sleeve to find the girl and destroy anyone who stands in his way. Her own confusion about good and evil doesn't help matters much either.The last horror film from legendary British studio Hammer, "To the Devil a Daughter" is quite an entertaining and intriguing picture up until its weak ending. Toted as the next big shocker in the vein of Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, it really doesn't prove to be quite as intense as those films, and it seems no one on the production was very happy with the resolution of the plot either (the author of the original novel, Dennis Wheatley, hated the film). The performances (by a very notable cast, including Hammer icon Christopher Lee as Rayner, screen legend Richard Widmark as hero/novelist John Verney, and a young Nastassja Kinski in the pivotal role of teen-nun Catherine) are excellent, and there are some great, ghastly scenes, like the usual satanic ritual orgy, but a few elements of the plot can get a bit confusing and overly complicate things, contrasted by that overly simple ending. Nevertheless, it's a great ride for the most part and was a big commercial success, but not quite enough to save Hammer Studios. This is gone into detail in the bonus documentary, "To the Devil...The Death of Hammer", which is a great viewing, though also sad for us major fans of the studio's style/body of work. Other extras include a theatrical trailer, good text bios of Christopher Lee and Richard Widmark, and a poster/still gallery. Another excellent release by Hammer presented uncut in a restored and enhanced widescreen. And, yes, the film features Nastassja Kinski doing full-frontal nudity, and she's really quite lovely throughout the film for the most part (a tad European for my tastes, but not bad at all), but by today's standards it seems more like she's wearing a pair of wooly knickers rather than doing full-frontal, ha. Still good though, still good.

$REVIEW.: ESSENTIAL MOVIE!!! The movie stars Claudette Colbert & Henry Fonda. It's based on a novel by Walter Edmonds of the same name. The period takes place at the outbreak of the American Revolution, one of the most poorly covered period of American history by Hollywood. Fonda & Colbert are husband & wife, Colbert coming from a well-to-do family. They moved to the Mohawk Valley in western New York to do farming. Of course, they are unprepared for the hostilities that break out with the Indians. The cinematography (nominated for an Academy Award) is beautiful & so is the color (nominated for an Academy Award). The film is directed by the great John Ford, one of America's best directors.There aren't any bonus features in this version but it's a high quality product. Enjoy one of the few good movies ever made by Hollywood that involve this period of American history.

$REVIEW.: Geraldine McEwen is a wonderful actress, but the current BBC production doesn't serve her well.  Everything is wonderful except the scripts, which are often ludicrous.  With such wonderful material as the Marple novels, why do the screen writers deviate from them so gratuitously, often turning the plots into gibberish?  Try the Joan Hickson Marple films.  With no disrespect to Ms. McEwen, Ms. Hickson was the perfect Jane, and the plots of these Christie stories were not nearly so badly mauled.

$REVIEW.: Comic superstar Will Ferrell (Old School & Elf) delivers the top news stories like no other in the laugh-out-loud comedy "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy". In the 1970s, chauvinistic news anchorman Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) and his cocky Channel 4 buddies are the most popular news team in San Diego. When competent news journalist Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) becomes the station's first female co-anchor, Burgundy plots to get rid of his new coworker at all cost. "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" is a marvelously entertaining comedy with great comic talent. The fun-filled summer comedy has a likable story, hilarious characters and some wildly amusing laughs. Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate have great onscreen comic chemistry. "Anchorman" also features a great supporting cast including Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Steve Carell, Fred Willard and Vince Vaughn, and funny appearances by Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Jack Black.If you can't get enough of Will Ferrell, then "Anchorman" Extended Edition is right for you. The enjoyable comedy is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD has an enjoyable video transfer with good resolution, and a pleasant Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. This extended edition contains a decent audio commentary, numerous deleted scenes, funny outtakes, a short behind-the-scenes documentary and some side-splitting featurettes like "Ron Burgundy's MTV Music Awards Interviews" and "Ron Burgundy's ESPN Audition". With its very funny supplements and fine presentation, "Anchorman" gets a "B+".

$REVIEW.: Yet another flick that enjoyed regular circulation on HBO back in the day when HBO had a tendency to play movies instead of eight billion different TV Shows.  If you had HBO back in the 80s and early 90s, you most likely saw this film(or part of it at least) at one time or another.The movie centers around a gang of auto-obsessed thugs in a small Arizona town.  They're led by the psychotic Packerd(Nick Cassavettes), and forcefully challenge kids to participate in backroads auto races, the stakes being the vehicles.  Naturally, Packerd's crew has the deck stacked and the gang tends to walk away with more cars than they lose(in fact, they don't loose any).  They also run a chop shop.  Packerd's sidekicks include a chemical huffing punker, a nerdy mechanical whiz(played by Clint Howard looking like he just stepped out of an audition for Eraserhead where he lost to Jack Nance), a childlike grease monkey, and a few other various schmucks.  In fact, none of them come across as particularly dangerous or threatening except for Packerd.Packerd is obsessed with Keri(Sherilyn Fenn, looking beautiful as always, but not quite to Twin Peaks levels), and will allow no man near her.  She thinks he's a creep, but is more or less forced into a relationship with him.  One night Packerd and his goons find Keri doing the nasty with another local boy, Jamey, and Packerd kills him right then and there.  Fast forward to the present(present being 1986) and a stranger arrives in town in the form of Jake(Charlie Sheen)a motorcycle riding prettyboy.  He immediately starts putting the moves on Keri, and she happily goes googily over him.  Also new in town is a spectral figure in a helmet and driving suit driving a souped up black car with seemingly supernatural properties-The Wraith!!!The Wraith systematically bumps off the members of Packerd's gang by challenging them to their own brand of backroad auto racing.  The Wraith has a tendency to make them crash and burn however.  Boy, I wonder if there's a connection between the murdered Jamey, newcomer Jake and The Wraith!This is a very cool little movie.  Sure folks may chuckle at the very 80s look and fashions, but that's all part of the film's charm.  After all it was made in the 1980s, so of course it will look like it.  It's not heavy on visual FX, but what it does use is actually quite good.  It may be one of Sheen's lesser known films, but it's probably his biggest cult fave.  He's not in the movie too much, nor does he say an awful lot either.  Instead the movie tends to focus more on Cassavettes' evil Packerd, his gang, and his odd and scary relationship with Keri.  In fact, the movie seems to be more of a vehicle(no pun intended) for Cassavettes to become a star.  It never happened, but I must say that Cassavettes is great in this movie.  He truly comes across as very unhinged and very dangerous.  At no point does he ever seem upset, threatened or fazed by The Wraith's taunts.  In one scene, the Wraith storms into his chop shop and blasts the place to pieces with a shotgun, and Packerd barely blinks an eye!  It's definitely an underrated villain performance on par with Timothy Van Patten's psycho teenager in Class Of 1984.Oddly there is no real explanation or background given to the Wraith.  Yeah, we know it's the murdered Jamey back to take revenge, but how?  And is he a ghost?  From outer space(the film's intro scene seems to imply this)?  Why the Car?  The snazzy shotgun?  The outfit?  Well, who really cares anyway?  I like the fact that you're only given enough information to understand what's going on and left to fill in the technical blanks yourself.  More movies should do this instead of trying to spell everything out to an audience who should be able to use their own imaginations and come to their own conclusions.The movie is rated PG-13, but it's an 80s PG-13 which means there's actually a bit of topless nudity here(yes, even a bit from Fenn!).  It really didn't need to be rated anything harder.If you're feeling nostalgic, The Wraith is definitely worth revisiting.  Even if you never saw it back in the day, it's still worth checking out coz it's just a damn good movie!

$review_text.: A phenomenal program that clearly elucidates the remaking of the world economies in our own capitalistic image. As a result, the elitist establishment possess these countries and their leaders by simply pulling the plug on any of their artificial economies, which in turn leads to a collapse of their fragile economic system and their total impoverishment. That paves the way to the image makers/vultures to offer them financial help (loans, etc) and as a result owning them for a tawdry price.The consequence of globalization and artificially reshaping people in our own image can be deadly most of the times for the clones but definitely profitable for the corporate leaders/politicians.That's true capitalism. Everything is for sale!This DVD is fascinating and enlightening. It is a must see for every concerned citizen about the world and the globalization process.

$REVIEW.: Now I doubt many of you who read this review have not seen this movie.  I also would think many of you who have watched it probably have it on DVD.  So let me save some people from having to read on.  If you have this movie on DVD should you buy it? Probably not for $20 but if you have yet to get this movie the Blu-ray option is an excellent choice.The story features all the favorite actors like Chevy Chase, Beverly DiAngelo and Randy Quaid.  Clark Griswald played by Chevy Chase just wants to have a normal traditional Christmas.  Of course when it's a National Lampoons Christmas everything is far from ordinary.  The comedy in this movie is non-stop.  From the crazy antics of Clark to Randy Quaids outstanding outlandish performance as the red neck with his crazy family.Now as many have rated the Blu-ray version I am here to say it really looks decent.  Not excellent.  The picture is clear and much improved from the DVD version.  The sound is decent and played thru all my five speakers.  Like I said earlier if you already have this on DVD your best bet is to stick with it.  Otherwise this is a great addition to anyones Christmas collection.

$REVIEW.: It's difficult to say what the intentions of the filmmaker were with this movie.  It's not funny enough, not horrific enough, not classy enough to render a clear classification.  The film starts with a belabored scene of a corpse/skeleton being flogged.  Half of the cast is supercilious; the other half forgot what century they were supposedly representing.  At times, it felt like a Monty Python sketch gone awry because not everyone was on the same page.  They even tossed in a whacky history lesson of sorts.  Jokes and a poor bewildered Oliver Reed do not make a great horror flick.  It also didn't help that Lance Henriksen was simply doing his usual panache of bug-eyes all a-glare while Jeffrey Combs looked out of place in a fright wig and bizarre spectacles reciting his lines as though he just got them that minute and wasn't certain if it was his cue or not.  Amateur stuff, more incompetent than inspired.  I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Not a chance of me ever watching this dreck again, you couldn't pay me.

$review_text.: This charming movie is clearly trying to paint a rosy picture of how well the EU can work despite the challenges of different ethnic identities and halfwitted British neo-hooligans. (In case the viewer doesn't pick up on this, the message is made quite explicit by film's end.)But despite this pamphleteering, I didn't mind a bit. The fact that "L'Auberge Espagnole" can turn a skeptical smirk into an open smile is a credit to how appealing the movie is. It's foolish, naive, and our protagonist learns an unrealistic number of "life lessons" in a year's time. No matter: Bravo!TRIVIA: This film was released in England under the name "Pot Luck." And it was originally going to be saddled with the unmarketable title "European Pudding."

$review_text.: This DVD presents the first two episodes (30 minutes each) of the Rurouni Kenshin OVA (miniseries), not to be confused with the theatrical film or the main television series.This DVD (and its companion, Betrayal), presents the backstory of Himura Kenshin (hero of the RuroKen series), during the years of the Imperialist Revolution against the Tokugawa Shoganate (i.e., more than 8 years before the start of the main series).This particular DVD tells how the orphaned Kenshin meets the solitary master of the ancient Hiten Mitsurugi style of Japanese swordsmanship; how the kind-hearted but tormented Kenshin is drawn into the rebellion (against his master's wishes); and how he comes very close to losing his soul as a special assassin for the struggling rebellion. It also recounts how the mysterious young woman named Tomoe comes into his life, and what happens to them when the Shinsengumi (a sort of police force for the Shogunate who are tasked to hunt down and stop the rebels) closes in on the bickering rebel factions.The OVA is very different in style and tone from the main series; subjectively, I can't decide whether it's better or worse (the two stylistic presentations are intended for two different target audiences, I think, and both do their distinctive jobs very well). Objectively, the animation is more detailed, nuanced and realistic. Music and sound are at the same high standard (by the same composer, too, I think), but appropriately more tragic and epic and even understated than what is sometimes found in the main series.These two DVDs stand well together as an independent storyline (it isn't necessary to know, or be a fan of, the main series); and in some not-insignificant ways, the film is better than the comparable live-action American Revolutionary War movie _The Patriot_. There are high standards of realism to the film--no hyper-jumps, or vacuum-slinging swords, but merely extremely realistic swordfighting.The violence level is very high, particularly in the first half of the first episode; but it is in keeping with the central point to the film: no matter how necessary killing may sometimes be, it is still a tragedy that threatens to turn the killer (even with the best of intentions) into a monster. Like many of the best oriental fighting-movies (and like the main series upon which the OVA story is based), the underlying message is actually rather anti-violent. Language is roughly PG-13 material. There is no nudity or sex, although the conversation veers occasionally into 'adult themes' (for entirely good reasons with respect to the plot).DVD production values are competent, though nothing particularly special. English dubbing is very good, and subtitling makes good sense; both are distinctive enough to be worth going through each, but overall I prefer the dubbing. Not being familiar with the Japanese language, I can't gauge how accurate they are to the original, but they fit what's shown very well.It's difficult to recommend when a fan of the main series should watch this. Fans should definitely get it, but it does contain many 'spoilers' about the history of Kenshin. The best time might be after season two of the series.

$review_text.: As a kid, I used to sneak out of bed and watch the late, late, late shows.  "The Day the Earth Stood Still" was one that had me glued to the set in fascination.I probably should have read a review before I went to the remake, but I prefer to make up my own mind.  The story's close to the same as the original:  an alien spacecraft containing Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) and a giant robot Gort lands on Earth. Of course, we attack, injure Klaatu and Gort is nearly stopped from killing all of the earthlings.Klaatu is taken to the hospital, but escapes seeking the help of Dr. Helen Benson (Connelly) and co-incidentally her son Jacob (Jaden Smith).  This time, Klaatu's people are destroying the earthlings because they are killing the Earth and it's one of the few planets which will sustain life.GOOD:  I like the reason for destroying the earthlings better.  It never made sense to me to kill us because we were killing each other.The FX are good.  Gort is especially well done.BAD:  Jaden Smith's performance nearly ruined the film for me.  This is a beautiful and talented kid and it's truly regrettable that someone had the idea to write him as a total brat.  If he'd been handled right, Jaden Smith could have easily stolen the scene from Reeves and it just didn't happen.  Young David Gray, in the original film, was just much better.Rebecca Kyle, December 2008

$review_text.: This is a wonderful movie.  The story is enchanting, with fantastic flying machines and cities in the air.  The land and air are full of strange and mysterious people who range from the kind and good to the power hungry evil types.  What is especially nice about the characterizations in this film is that only a few are wholly good or wholly evil, most are a mix and are trying to work out their place in the plot of the story.The story opens with an action sequence without any explanation about what is happening.  This causes us to focus our attention and to try and figure out what is going on and what all these strange people and machines are.  In some ways it seems like a 1930s serial, in others futuristic, and in others ancient myth without connection to the world in which we live.While this isn't as beautiful as "Spirited Away" or even "Princess Mononoke", it is still head and shoulders above nearly everything you see passing as an animated movie nowadays (with a couple of exceptions).  My kids encouraged me to get this DVD and they enjoyed it immensely.  I expected to like it, but enjoyed it more than I expected.Miyazaki has a unique imagination and has a powerful ability to use his wonderful images to tell the story in delightful and beautiful ways that go beyond conventional live action movies - no matter the special effects budget - or even most animation.  Watching his stories is a special experience that I am grateful to him for sharing with me.

However the match got a little slow in the middle and Rey didnt do as much flying as i wanted to see. Good match terrible story line even tho Randy played his role great. I dont want to see the tragic death of Eddie Guerrero as a story line it's not right.Best Performence- Randy OrtonMatch Rating- ****Main Event C-Kurt Angle vs The UndertakerThis was the match of the year. Period. I dont see a better match possible and i dont want to see a rematch even though i think we will at Judgement Day. The Undertaker was determined to put on a great match and they really did. Better than Michaels vs Angle this match was amazing. Its the reason i came straight to my computer to right about it right when it ended i think i might watch it again later tonight.Best Performence- The Undertaker and Kurt AngleMatch Rating- ***** - First ever 5 stars23.75/30 = 79% thats off the charts MUST BUY75-70 = A69-66 = A-65-63 = B+62-60 = B59-56 = B-55-53 = C+52-50 = C49-46 = C-45-43 = D+42-36 = D35-00 = F

Or the person that founded the Asylum movie company, they're pretty indistinguishable from each other.It's an Asylum film, so telling you that it's cheap, badly acted, or obscenely tedious would be an exercise in redundancy


To be perfectly blunt, I no longer really blame them for releasing an unending putrid stream of cinematic atrocities

I didnt expect a sequel so fast but Roth definitely delivered with this film.  This film has managed to outdo the fantastic original by exposing more information about the organization responsible for the murders and showing the murderers side of the story while showing the females who get tortured this time.Dont listen to the haters since they most likely havent even since this film and are just basing it on the subject matter which doesnt appeal to them.BUY THIS MOVIE along with the original and his other great film Cabin Fever!

$review_text.: Reviewers have called it "the gay 'American Pie'", but a more proper name might be "Gay Anerican Quiche" as that dish is used in the same way as an apple pie in that teen flick. And, believe it or not, that is NOT the low point of the film!The basic plot of the film: A group of gay friends are graduating from high school, and form a pact to make sure they lose their "anal virginity" before the summer is over and they go off to college. The main character is Andy, who has a crush on a Russian teacher (played to the hilt by Graham Norton) and whose father (played by gay comic Scott Thompson) tries to keep him from stealing all of the carrots and cucumbers in the house, by buying him a HUGE buttplug. Jarod is a varsity athlete, Griff the shy closet romantic who strives for a "bubble butt", and Nico is a queeny punkish partyboy, with a blind girlfriend and a mom who seems clueless to her son's sexuality. They get advice from their bulldyke best friend Muffler, who seems to be able to seduce any woman, straight or gay. Their dates include guest stars Matthew Rush (a gay porn star), Richard Hatch ("Survivor") and James Getzlaff ("Boy Meets Boy").To be honest, ANOTHER GAY MOVIE is often hillarious in its outrageousness, and the (I'd bet 100% gay) small crowd at the theatre during the showing I attended laughed a lot and seemed to enjoy it, though I doubt any of them would have rated it higher than I did. In my opinion, the humor would register more with older gays (30+) who can identify (Been there, done that) with the cluelessness of the young main characters, as opposed to informed teens and 20-somethings who grew up in more open times and had resources like the internet. Also, I'd bet that there was at least one or two scenes most viewers would have preferred weren't there, be it the overdone bathroom humor, a naked Richard Hatch waiting waiting for Nico to have sex with him, or the two guys at the bar with NAMBLA (a group that advocates sex with young boys) t-shirts advising Griff that he is "way too old" at 17.Beyond the sight gags and gross-outs, the story is predictable, with a lot of overacting, scenes meant to shock rather than add anything to the film, and lots of unrealistic scenarios. But I did love the theme song, "Another Gay Sunshine Day" sung by Nancy Sinatra. :)The theatrical film is not rated, but would be courting an NC-17 due to abundant frontal nudity, simulated sex, grahic sex talk and over-the-top S&M; content (Trust me: you'll never look at Graham Norton quite the same way again!) Not likely to go into wide release but, FYI, the DVD release date was just announced to be November 21st.

$REVIEW.: If you never read the original novel, you could easily find this movie above average if you can handle the subject matter.  Unfortunately this film's version of the main character Humbert isn't Nabokov's, and that's a shame because the strength of the story is Nabokov's detail in how addicted to 12-14 year old girls Humbert was.  It's as if the screenwriter and director were given a synopsis of the story and never took the time to actually read the novel.  That being said, Jeremy Irons was very good but you expect that from a serious actor.  This gets only one star for taking a great novel and not being true to the original author's main character.  And I recall having some sympathy for Lolita while reading the book.  I never felt that while watching this movie.

$review_text.: This is a far more physical Bond than any we've seen before. Daniel Craig exudes strength, power and, indeed, a raw sexual allure. This Bond is also more tender, gentle, and fallible. It's also a Bond that spends quite a bit of time baring his skin. Good thing Mr. Craig is familiar with the inside of a gym.The plot of the film is simple enough. A rogue financier of rebellious factions, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson), has gambled with the money entrusted to him and lost it all. He must regain it in a game of poker with an astonishing stake: $150 million. Bond has, as allies, Versper Lynd (Eva Green, Kingdom of Heaven), and Matthis (Giancarlo Giannini, Hanibal).For such a simple plot, this was highly entertaining. The action scenes are believable to the point of pain, and Daniel Craig stakes his claim as Bond more powerfully than anyone since Connery.The high-tech gadgets we've come to expect in every scene of a Bond film aren't as much in evidence here, but there are enough for the techno nerd in anyone.

The energy and comedy of the original cast and the comic timing of Shatner, Nimoy and Kelly are incredible.I MUDD: This is a great showcase for the late Roger C Carmel. He was wonderful in playing the character Harcord &quot;Harry&quot; Fenton Mudd, that this was the one episode they wrote for him after his other stellar performance in MUDD WOMEN. Funny and excellent example of how Star Trek can take a serious subject and make it entertaining and funny.THE TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES: Simply - David Gerold at his very best. Filled with Tribbles, Klingons and attitude this romp to save &quot;Wheat&quot; is histerical. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy shine in this one too!. William Campbell comes back (He was Trelane in THE SQUIRE OF GOTHOS in an earlier epsiode) but this time as the Klingon Captain to yet again be at odds with Captain Kirk.All the supporting cast get their shinging moments in each film. Espeically, Chekova nd Uhura. (Koenig and Nichols)This is a must DVD to have for evry original Star Trek fan! Write me, tell me what you think.

It was a dark, moody film, about a dark, brooding figure trying to find some kind of revenge for the death of his parents

It was about urban decay and the need for romance  and mystery in tawdry, hum-drum lives

It starred two of the greatest  pieces of casting of the eighties - Keaton as Batman, and Nicholson as the  Joker


And what have we arrived at? A children's film, starring superheroes  who attend parties, villains who mustn't be allowed to die, and lines that  Pee-wee Herman would reject as improbable


Tim Burton was the man for this  series - Schumacher is not


Ladies and gentleman, I give you one of the  most badly written, trashily directed, awkwardly acted, stupidly plotted,  and nauseatingly conceived mangled finger-painting of a film it may ever be  your misfortune to gaze upon in disbelief

$review_text.: Will Ferrell and John Heder play Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy, figure skating competitors with vastly different styles who get banned for life from men's figure skating when they get in a fight over a competition that ended with them in a tie.Fast-forward a couple of years, and both their lives are ruined, when they get a proposition: there's nothing in the rulebook that says that the skaters in pairs skating must be of opposite genders.The rest of the film is one gag after another as the two train together, and the reigning king and queen of pairs skating, Stranz and Fairchild (Amy Poehler and Will Arnett), scheme to keep them out of competition.Adding a sweet counter (and welcome relief, I must admit) to the silliness is Stranz and Fairchild's younger sister Katie (Jenna Fischer) falls for Jimmy MacElroy and is torn between being her siblings' dogsbody (think Julia Roberts's character in America's Sweethearts) and following her heart.It's not Great Cinema, but it's a lot of fun, a lot of laughs. A warning, though: if you don't already like Will Ferrell, Blades of Glory will not change your mind.

$review_text.: The Simpsons was one of the greatest shows in history


Season 10 and 11 disappointed me so much that I stopped watching them but the first 5 seasons are classics with many unforgettable episodes

4th and 5th season are the best for their comedy and they used to be my favorite but the first 2 seasons became my favorite eventually

There's a certain edge to the early episodes that the show gradually lost with age

The stories have more serious parts throughout but I still got a good amount of laughs, particularly Bart making crank calls to Moe's Tavern
I'll always look back and remember the show in it's early days with a rough, grainy sketching
This was the real Simpsons and the show was at it's peak here
Two Cars In Every Garage, Three Eyes On Every Fish is my favorite episodes but all are great
This is also the first to include a Tree-House Of Horror Episode for every Halloween.

$review_text.: I think it is odd that people view this movie as a horror and then get upset by it. The movie cannot be completely categorized in any one genre since each story attempts to create a different mood. The only pervasive style, however, is dark comedy.The first segment is nothing but humor, with a slight touch of morbid moments. A good example of the type of humor that's in this story is when James Woods' character has tried to quit smoking and he goes to a party. The room is completely smoke-filled and everybody offers him a cigarette every three seconds. Soon, he starts to hallucinate--and sees a giant pack of cigarettes walking around and taunting him. Obviously, this isn't horror.The second segment is the most serious of all three. It is supposed to be a suspense story, and it is mostly successful. I've always enjoyed it, but given that it is surrounded by much campier material, it seems out of place here.The third segment is an adventure story. It could, because of the presence of the troll, be considered a horror by some viewers, but it is incredibly silly. It's the story of a cat fighting out a duel with a little monster, replete with Howie-Mandel-esque voice-overs. It alternates quickly between humor and adventure, but it is not scary unless you are a small child.The movie suffers only for two reasons: one is that some special effects shots have suffered greatly (although quite a few are still amazing). The other is that whenever the movie does try to be serious, it never works as well as it should. It's like watching a clown do a routine with seltzer water, and then trying to recite a soliloquy from &quot;Hamlet&quot; without changing his make-up. By the time the movie does reach its more serious moments, you'll already be in a laughing mood.

$review_text.: Another curate's egg from Lean, but redeemed by one of Robert Mitchum's greatest ever performances, bravely cast against type as the gentle Irish schoolteacher who becomes the village joke when his young wife takes up with a shell-shocked British officer. Ignored at the time for the showier attractions of Mills' village idiot (a role Norman Wisdom desperately wanted), it's a remarkably intelligent and subtly observed character study that holds far more appeal than Sarah Miles' title role. As always, Lean reserves the real talent (Mills, Trevor Howard, Leo McKern) for the sidelines and comes up with one of his blandest leads in the shape of Peter O'Toole lookalike and future down-and-out Jones while the force of history is reduced to background for a simple love story.Maurice Jarre's score is something of a liability, but overall this is still the best of the director's post-Lawrence films and certainly not fully deserving of the critical slating that led to his 17-year absence from the screen. There is still a very real sense of the cinematic, with both colour and the widescreen ratio exploited to the full, something the increasingly TV-conscious director refused to even attempt with the surprisingly poor A Passage to India.Although much impact is lost in the step down from 70mm to TV screen - particularly during the vivid storm sequence - the widescreen DVD makes it seem like a different and much better film if you've only ever seen it panned-and-scanned before. With some excellent extras, it's a fine presentation.

It was completely unexpected, even as it was happeneing I didnt understand why it was happening and he just wouldnt stop beating her.  I guess now having a wife and daughter really struck a nerve.I have always enjoyed the "saw" series and praised "hostil" for it originality, but the killer inside me really put me down.

$REVIEW.: Communists, according to Bertolucci, have an easier time getting it up than do capitalists, whose impulse to oppress leads inevitably to impotence and sexual repression.What's a young landowner to do? This is one of the most beautiful films ever made. The acting is superb: I don't think you'll ever see DeNiro, Burt Lancaster, or Donald Sutherland do a better job. Some surprising nudity, including a bottomless DeNiro at his skinny youthful best. This is the uncut European version, longer and better than the American version first released here. It goes strong until the capture and murder of Attila (Sutherland)at the end of WWII. After that, there is a long, boring "trial" of the landowner by the peasants, not unlike the opening of Bertolucci's second masterpiece, "The Last Emperor." Still, one can overlook this sort of thing, or perhaps even enjoy it for nostalgic satisfaction. After all, when was the last time you saw a film that believed in progress?

$review_text.: Having never heard of this movie when it was in general release (if it ever was) it seemed a good Saturday evening diversion type story.  Once the film begins and it is apparent that the director is P.J. Hogan who has created such fun and sensitive stories as MURIEL'S WEDDING and MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, then the gentle humor and touching messages are welcome and anticipated.  With a cast that includes sterling performances by the always excellent Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Jonathan Pryce, and Lynn Redgrave,  the impact is one of polished comedy and sincere pathos blended as well as Hogan has done in the past.  Hogan likes to touch on issues such as 'different' people, be those differences as in gender identity, physical stature ( small person Meredith Eaton is a beautiful and gifted actress), or social mores.  Briefly, Kathy Bates plays a housewife who fantasizes an affair with a popular British singer (Jonathan Pryce - who not only acts well but is given the opprtunity to share his significant vocal talents in person and on the soundtrack of the film).  Her husband of 25 years (Dan Ackroyd) announces to her that their marriage is over because Bates is boring.  That same day her idol is killed and she decides to go to England for the funeral!  Once there she intrudes into the house of her fantasy man only to discover that he was gay and has a lover of 10 years (Rupert Everett) who is being ostracized by the singers' family.  Persistance and happenstance throw these two together and the resultant bi-continental declaration for revenge of the death of their shared hero (with a lot of help form Bates' daughter-in-law Meredith Eaton) forms the bulk of the tale.  Along the way they encounter the real life Julie Andrews, Sally Jessy Raphael, and Barry Manilow in what could have been a pushed overindulgence, but Hogan keeps the tempo down so that these guests appearances maintain the jolly mood of this fluffy but warmly entertaining movie. Definitely a feel good film!

$REVIEW.: I'd read that the director of the Captain Marvel serial thought Tom Tyler was a terrible actor (which is why he said a total of about 12 words the whole time), but this proves him wrong.  He's a very good phantom and this is a good ride.There are offensive stereotypes, so get ready for the occasional cringe and this is not the Royal Academy in terms of acting or writing, but if you shut down your critical brain for a while, you'll probably find yourself drawn in--a little like quicksand.

$REVIEW.: Haywire is a mainstream action movie the likes of which you'll rarely see.  Directed by Steven Soderbergh, Haywire is also unique for featuring gorgeous MMA fighter Gina Carano in her first starring role as Mallory Kane, a freelance covert op that finds herself double-crossed, betrayed, on the run, and looking for a little payback.  The premise of Haywire is simple, but Soderbergh's deft handling makes what would be an otherwise so-so action flick and makes it something unique thanks to his style.  Carano's line delivery could use some work, but her action sequences are wonderful, and it doesn't hurt that she's quite easy on the eyes.  Also featuring Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton, and Channing Tatum; Haywire is a unique mainstream action flick that deserves your attention.  If flashy, fast-edit action flicks are your thing, you're not going to dig Haywire, but if you're looking for something different, give this a look.

$review_text.: The first installment in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, based on Tolkien's novels, this film introduces the story

Bilbo Baggins is having his birthday and hands over his fabled ring to his young relative Frodo
Now the fate of Middle Earth is in the hands of the little Hobbit as he makes the long journey to Mount Doom in Mordor


Traveling with Frodo is the wizard Gandalf, his three hobbit friends, an elf, a dwarf, a man, and of course Aragorn


Together they make up the Fellowship bent on protecting Frodo and delivering him safely


Peter Jackson's film is a very good adaption of Tolkien's world
However, it is important to realize this is only the beginning

The story is completed in The Two Towers and The Return of the King.

$REVIEW.: "So Dear To My Heart" was made by Walt Disney in 1948 andcontained a mix of animated and live action scenes.Fortunately, the animation has been kept to a minimumbecause it is the live action scenes that linger on in thememory.The story is set around 1903 and viewing this movie is liketaking a step through a portal in time when everything wasbasic and simple. It was a long time before the advent oftelevision, the technology revolution and other demands ofmodern day living which cluttered up our lives.The story is about a young boy Jeremiah Kincaid (BobbyDriscoll), who lives with his granny (Beulah Bondi) who israising him and they live together in a rustic log cabin atthe edge of a small country town called Fulton Cornerswhere granny does small crop farming and raises animals fora living.Jeremiah wants an animal for himself to look after so headopts a new born lamb, a mischievous looking critter withblack wool which soon gets out of control, running aboutwild and wrecking everything in sight. Granny wants to getrid of the pest but later relents because of the boy's loveand devotion to the animal.Uncle Hiram (Burl Ives) and his daughter Tildy (LuanaPatten) visit the Kincaid homestead regularly and do whatthey can to help out.Jeremiah sets his heart on entering his pet in thecompetition at the local county fair where he hopes to winfirst prize. However, he does not win because his pet hasblack wool and to the judges it is an oddity which excludesit from consideration. However, the chief judge (Harry Carey)presents Jeremiah with a rare Special Award not given in thelast 4 years, because despite its black wool, the animal is achampion in its own right and it has been groomed for thecompetition with loving care and affection.It is essentially a nostalgic tale with great atmosphere forthe time in which the movie is set. Jeremiah is typical ofthe young boys growing up in that era - care-free, runningaround barefooted and improvising his own activities for theday. It is interesting to watch granny ploughing the fieldwith her mule, spinning her thread on a hand operated spinningwheel and doing her handcraft just for pleasure sake.Evenings would be spent with granny, uncle Hiram, Jeremiahand Tildy relaxing in the living room playing recorded musicon the gramophone and uncle Hiram would strum his guitar andperhaps sing a song.The movie includes amongst other delightful tunes, two oldfolksy songs namely "Lavender Blue (Dilly Dilly)" and "BillyBoy" which are a joy to listen to. Going into Grundy's cornerstore is another trip down memory lane.Beulah Bondi and Burl Ives in perhaps their most memorable rolesare superb as are the children Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten.Highly reommmended.

$REVIEW.: This film is such an embarassment to the James Bond series, I can't even bring myself to watch it. First of all, Roger Moore looks OLD as heck in this film! His last film as Bond should have been "For Your Eyes Only", which is his best performance as Bond. Tanya Roberts (Stacey) is the most annoying Bond girl of all time and not at all believable as a California's state geologist and a businesswoman. Every time it comes to a fight or some action she cowers and whimpers, yelling `Help me James' at the top of her shrill voice, and spends most of the time as some sort of damsel in distress for Bond to save.The only good thing about this movie is Christopher Walken plays a great villian and its good to see the great Patrick Macnee on screen again. Also, the title song by Duran Duran is awesome too. Other than that, this movie is lame. Watch if you must!

$review_text.: I loved this movie! I don't care that I don't understand the end or much of anything else about it. I may figure it out someday, or I may not, but that does not in any way diminish the joy this wonderful movie gave me.I was fascinated for every one of its 75 minutes. The music alone is exhilarating, an eclectic mix including an 18th century Handel song and modern instrumentals that made me want to dance (and I am NOT a dancer). Sebastian Schlecht, who plays Johann, the darker-haired of the two lovers, is extraordinarily appealing in a quirky, understated way, and his expressions during the last ten minutes of the movie just blew me away.I never assume actors are gay, but if these two are not, then they had the best direction any two straight actors ever had, and they followed that direction with courage and dedication and talent few actors have. I believed completely in the passion and the tenderness between them, and their love scenes are some of the most erotic I have ever seen, although they are not even close to being explicit sexually.I can't get over how much better this movie is than other reviewers led me to expect.

$REVIEW.: Most people think of the Muppets from Sesame Street or their successful 70s TV show, where "Entertaining the Family, especially the kids" was the point.Few people remember that when Jim Henson first started appearing on TV with the Muppets, the humor was very much more adult-oriented--not "dirty" adult, but slapticky adult. Things exploded. Creatures were devoured by other creatures. Still others died comically. (Remember the black and white coffee commercials, where a Muppet is asked how he likes a certain brand of coffee? He says he doesn't like it and the interviewing muppet promptly blows him away with a cannon. Then he turns the cannon to the camera and says to the viewer, "Now, what do YOU think of (NAME) coffee?")Well, that sense of humor is prevalent on the bulk of this DVD and it's marvelous.  Henson's appearances on Ed Sullivan are compiled in chronological order,  starting with "Instant Rock Band," where a small furry thing expands into a full garage band before your eyes.From there, we are treated to an early version of what would become the Cookie Monster, gleefully devouring a talking machine that gets the last laugh after it's been swallowed.The Muppets' first performance of  "Ma Nah Ma Nah," which actually became a hit record for them during the 70s after this skit was resurrected on their TV show,  is here and is remarkably funny.  (When the guy looks down the horn-like noses of his bovine background singers, the look on his face is hilarious.)Of course, once Sesame Street showed up, Sullivan HAD to have Big Bird on, and it's those "crossover" skits that suffer the most. But you can skip over them.Definitely get this. It's worth every penny. And it's worth looking into the mind of Jim Henson and what he could do when we was told he could do whatever he liked.

$REVIEW.: 1976 was a year to remember in pictures.Five now classics,ROCKY,BOUND FOR GLORY,ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN,TAXI DRIVER and Sidney Lumet's NETWORK all vied for the top honor.ROCKY won, but NETWORK garnered the most awards for acting and screenplay.Watch it, and you will be amazed at how stinging and revelatory this film has prophetically remained, as it indicts the television networks for its shameless attempt to capture viewer share no matter what the cost.With the Saudi's "buying up America",the Simbianese Liberation Army kidnapping Patty Hearst and Gerald Ford pardoning Richard Nixon as he now enters the White House,failing 4th place television network UBS must find a way to capture the lion's share of viewers in America in order to survive in a world of corporate takeover.This was new in 1976.....and sadly this film,which prognosticated the current trends, now stands in 2007 as almost Biblically prophetic fulfillment.Sensation was the order for the day, and UBS uses anchorman Howard Beale,a newscaster who has suffered an on-the-air nervous breakdown,to be reincarnated as the "mad prophet of the airways." UBS callously milks Beale for all it is worth,as their ratings sore to the top, and the American public starts turning into to exploitative programming that is more sensational than it is informing.The network no longer is a place for individuality,but now a place where everyone is swept up in corporate greed.Lives become obsessed and ruined as the network begins to churn out this type of programming.The bottom line is all that matters.Quality is not what matters.It is strictly competition and market share.Paddy Chayefsky's bombastic,in your face,riveting dialogued screenplay is only made all the more vital and bristling by the A-List acting of William Holden, Peter Finch,Faye Dunaway,Robert Duvall,Ned Beatty and others.Apart from 12 ANGRY MEN, NETWORK is director Lumet's finest moment.(Some may opt for THE VERDICT).These actors are allowed to explode on screen.There is nothing tame or restrained about NETWORK.It is a true actor's "tour-de-force",and Lumet trusts each performer to inhabit to the fullest their perspective characters.The fact that this film has no soundtrack only serves to highlight the immense quality of Chayefsky's writing which is high brow and biting and fills every frame with bitter,cannibalistic rhetoric.Yes,1976 was an amazing year for films.Put away ROCKY and change the channel to NETWORK.

$SUMMARY.: 4 Oscars and 31 years later;NETWORK is even more indicting than back then!

Unknown to us there is a special group of helpers in Santa's arsenal that ensure the big guy makes his rounds with no problems.....they are Prep and Landing.

Wayne is the top P&L; elf, with over 200 years experience, but when he is not given the promotion to the Naughty List group, his Christmas spirit goes Scrooge.  Can Lenny (or treeskirt as wayne calls him), his new partner fresh from trainig school remind him what it means to be part of P&L; and why tey do their jobs?  Then when a Coal Elf squad member loses a vital piece of North Pole tech to a naughty child, the P&L; duo Wayne and Lenny are called in to assist getting it back.  Joined by Wayne's younger brother from the Coal Elf division, they must enter the fortress of this child.  But can the brothers work together to pull this job off especially when Lenny discovers things are not exactly as naughty or nice as they thought and can they trust this one when a virus threatens to destroy the North Pole server?I loved these two, and hope there is a new one this year.  These two join other classic holiday shows like Charlie Brown Christmas, the animated Grinch who stole Christmas, and the Nightmare before Christmas.  Pick it up and see what truly goes on when not a creature is stirring on December 24th.

$REVIEW.: Babel isn't so much about plot. It's really about understanding one another in a world that is full of difference and inequality. The film is a collection of very loosely intertwined narratives that debate the same theme; how this world seems deaf and blind to its true problems.In the first narrative, we have two Americans (Pitt and Blanchette) traveling abraod. When the woman is shot, terrorists are immediately blamed. Now, stuck in this country - and in the middle of a political war - Pitt has to try and deal with his wife's faith. Problem is, we, the viewers, know that this was not a terrorist attack but truly a prank gone bad, as the woman was shot by two pre-teen boys trying out their father's rifle. Their narrative is also revealed and the impact of their action is sad and shocking.Back in America, a Mexican nanny wants to go to her son's wedding in Mexico. But she is stuck with the two American kids is cares for. Deciding to bring them to her son's wedding is a mistake since, upon coming back into the US, she is accused of having kidnapped the kids since she is Mexican and has trouble communicating with the boarder patrol. This is by far the best narrative in this film. There is a scene where the woman runs away in the desert with the children. As she gets lost, you can see the fear growing in her, until she can no longer control everything she is feeling.Finally, in Asia, a young deaf woman only wants to be loved. But because she lacks communication skills, no one understands her basic needs. The fact that no one understands her and, in a way, that she doesn't understand her own self makes her one of the saddest characters I've seen on screen in a while.In the end, all these storylines are link. But this is not the important thing in this movie. This movie is about silence and about understanding through images and actions. The narrative is slow at times, but I liked the way the film took its time to tell its story. There is rarely a dull moment in Babel and the emotional punch strikes you right in the gut and steals your breath away.Babel really had an impact on me. After watching it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I highly recommended this film to anyone who enjoyed the director's previous efforts. A true gem.

$REVIEW.: "The ABCs of Death" is a horror anthology film where 26 different directors were given one letter, asked to choose one word, and then were given creative and artistic freedom to come up with their segment of the film. Directors include Jason Eisener ("Hobo with a Shotgun"), Xavier Gens ("The Divide"), Noboru Iguchi ("Machine Girl"), Yoshihiro Nishimura ("Suicide Club"), Banjong Pisanthanakun ("Shutter"), Simon Rumley ("Red White & Blue"), Srdjan Spasojevic ("A Serbian Film"), Nacho Vigalondo ("Timecrimes"), Ti West ("The House of the Devil"), Ben Wheatley ("Kill List"), and Yudai Yamaguchi (writer of "Versus") among many others. The anthology undeniably sets the bar awfully high for the most insane cinematic effort for a given year.After the excellent efforts from fellow anthology films "The Theatre Bizarre" and "V/H/S," it's as if the format of a horror film comprised of several different short films has made a resurgence over the past couple of years. "The ABCs of Death" capitalizes on that aspect and is perhaps the most ambitious version of the format yet; 26 stories with nothing in common other than horrific death. Strap yourselves in, horror fans. This is like immediately jumping to the climax without any foreplay.With the massive amount of segments in the film, you can imagine that the quality can fluctuate quite a bit from beginning to end. The film can't be judged on just a good or bad scale as some segments are extremely peculiar (H), grotesque (I), and flat out ridiculous (F). Several other segments put more weight into the comedy department. J deals with an executioner seeing a man make funny faces as he commits harakiri, K probably has the most absurd interaction between a woman and the business she does in the restroom, and N shows why giving your girlfriend a parrot may not be the best idea.Z is literally so ludicrous that you can't help but laugh. With its giant penises and vegetables being shot out of vaginas while this character in a wheelchair is like this odd homage to "Dr. Strangelove," Z is able to combine just a little bit of everything to end up being so fantastically memorable. S is one of the most well rounded segments since it actually seems to tell a complete story or at least as much of one as can be told in that limited amount of time.Personal favorites include the disgustingly brilliant L, the uniquely disturbing R, the entertaining claymation of T, the incredible perspective of U, the futuristic V, the powerful X, and Jason Eisener's Y that's set to some awesome 80s throwback music.Featuring the likes of women attracted to farts, samurais, talking birds, drug addicts, monster toilets, vampires, robots, pedophiles, chainsaw sex, and naked men making sushi at gunpoint, "The ABCs of Death" pretty much has every base covered. "The ABCs of Death" is a repulsive and excessive excuse of blood-soaked entertainment that should make the horror fan in you squeal with delight.

$review_text.: The core concept of this film has special relevance almost 40 years after its initial release, given recent developments in genetic engineering: Recycling of human beings, whole or in parts. As I again watched it, I thought about several themes which have intrigued man throughout history, such as eternal youth (e.g. the fountain of youth) and unholy pacts (e.g. in the Garden of Eden and, later, Dr. Faust). Dissatisfied with his life, Arthur Hamilton (John Randolph) presents himself to The Company and agrees (for a substantial fee) to become a different person and have a lifestyle about which he has obviously fantasized for many years. After extensive surgery, he becomes Antiochus ("Tony") Wilson (Rock Hudson), twenty years younger, strikingly handsome, physically fit, and living what is for many males an idealized bachelor's life. He seems to have everything Hamilton once desired and yet....This is among the subtlest but also one of the most frightening of films. To say more about its plot would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen it. Suffice to say that, under the brilliant direction of John Frankenheimer, the cast plays out what becomes a horror story of almost unbearable impact. My opinion is that Hudson's performance is his strongest throughout a lengthy film career. Will Geer appears briefly but memorably, as do others in a diverse cast which includes Murray Hamilton, Jeff Corey, Richard Anderson, and Salome Jens. Also noteworthy is James Wong Howe's cinematography which nourishes, indeed intensifies the gradually-increasing sense of terror as Wilson attempts without success to re-negotiate the terms and conditions of his surgically-enhanced life. Whenever I recall the final scene, I shudder despite the fact that I have seen this film several times and know that it is "only a movie."

$review_text.: "In Old California" is a 1942 western starring John Wayne with Binnie Barnes and Albert Dekker, featuring Helen Parrish, Patsy Kelly and Edgar KennedyJohn Wayne (1907-79) was a bankable box office draw at the time. He made more than 100 films by 1942, although most of them had been forgettable B westerns.  Then in 1939 he made "Stagecoach" with John Ford, and his career took an upturn.  Stagecoach earned 5 Oscars including Best Picture. Wayne followed up with "Dark Command" (1940) directed by Raoul Walsh, and "Old California" was just about the last of the B films he would be handed.  Wayne went on to make a series of war movies (e.g.,  "Flying Tigers" in 1942, "The Fighting Seabees"  in 1944, "Back to Bataan" and "They Were Expendable" in 1945) and his classic westerns including "3 Godfathers" (1948),  "Fort Apache" (1948), "Red River" (1948), "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" (1949, "Rio Bravo" (1959), and "The Alamo" (1960) . Wayne was nominated for Best Actor for "Sands of Iwo Jima" (1949) and he would finally earn an Oscar for "True Grit" (1969).FWIW - Wayne was excited about his role as a Pharmacist in this film since this was his father's profession, and he had passed away just a few years earlier. Yet his performance is less than expected, probably due to all the marital problems he was having at the time - his separation had just been announced.Binnie Barnes (1903-98) plays a dance hall girl with a golden heart, who is romanced by evil Albert Decker but in love with Wayne. Barnes was a major star of the 30s, appearing in "Private Life of Henry VII" (1933) with Charles Laughton (won the Oscar), "Private Life of Don Juan" (1934) with Douglas Fairbanks (his last film role), "Diamond Jim" (1935), "Last of the Mohicans" (1936) with Randolph Scott and "3 Musketeers" (1939) with Don Ameche. Her philosophy was - "I'm no Sarah Bernhardt. One picture is just like another to me as long as I don't have to be a sweet woman."Albert Dekker (1905-68) played the bad guy in more than 50 films such as Big Jim Colfax in "The Killers" (1946), the evil Dr. Thorkel in "Dr. Cyclops" (1940), the evil Dr. Soberin in "Kiss Me Deadly" (1955) and the evil railroad man Pat Harrigan in "The Wild Bunch" (1969). Occasionally he played a hero (e.g., "Wake Island).Patsy Kelly (1910-81) provided comic relief in nearly 100 films between 1929 and 1979, including "Freaky Friday" (1976), "Please Don't Eat the Daisies" (1960), and "Topper Returns" (1941).Edgar Kennedy (1890-1948) was a comic foil in more than 400 films between 1911 and 1949, including "Duck Soup" (1933), "Lil Abner" (1940), and "Anchors Aweigh" (1945). He was one of the original Keystone Cops and was called "the king of the slow burn".William McGann (1893-1977) directs. He had an undistinguished career from 1930 to 1944 directing more than 50 films. "In Old California" is the best of his films.The NY Times Bosley Crowther called the film "plain horse-opera in store-bought clothes" and bemoaned that "it stumbles and gets all mixed up in its own plot." He said - "If John Wayne and Binnie Barnes weren't in it, it would be down with the usual run of strays."1942 was a good year in films - "Yankee Doddle Dandy" and "Mrs. Miniver" were the clear Oscar winners and at the box office. Other popular films included "Casablanca", "Woman of the Year", Alan Ladd's "This Gun for Hire", Gary Cooper's "Pride of the Yankees",  and "Road to Morocco"All things considered the film is OK. Wayne fans might watch it for nostalgia, but he did so much better work that it seems wasteful to spend time on this film. Both Kennedy and Kelly are OK but they gave such better performances that this film offers nothing special. Decker's villain in this film is among his weakest portrayals, and Binne Barnes looks a little tired. For hardcore B western fans, you might give it a look.

$review_text.: Like a lot of people I walked into BUG following on the heels of the marketing which sold the film as a horror about... bugs.People trapped in a small space, tin foiled walls, creepy blue lighting, things getting under your skin that should not be there... all wrong (well, almost).  Instead BUG is a tight, sparse, threadbare story of people holed up on their own souls being held prisoner by addiction.  I sat through three quarters of this film waiting for the monsters to arrive, only to find that I had been watching them from the start.  Human monsters, human vices, human horrors - life at the end of pipe.  Not the film I signed up for, not the film I was looking for... but, can anything be salvaged from BUG to recommend?Three things... first, the performances are not bad.  At times it comes across like a far gritter episode of THE L WORD with flashes of brilliance that really help to sell the idea behind the picture.  But, they don't come often, leaving the rest of the film to float along like a block of wood in water.  It's dense, often soap opera quality at best and clipped.  There are some plot surprises, and if you take the time to piece it all together (and, fair warning, it's not easy when you don't have all the pieces to the puzzle) you will get something out of it.  Finally, the direction is not bad.  It's tough to take three rooms and somehow make them into film, but Friedkin does it well enough to keep the picture moving.But, in the end, there is very little to BUG worth watching.  The ending comes quickly and suddenly and with some surprise, but adds nothing to to what had come before it.Commentary is included with the film and for the blind, this commentary will help, but for the rest of it, Friedkin's habit of telling you exactly what's happening on screen as it's actually happening wastes your time.  He does go into some background, does give us some thoughts, but for the majority of the commentary it's too literal to be worth listening to.BUG might have done better to actually have had some bugs in it to help move it along, but as it stands, BUG is a stalled and flawed picture on the state of paranoia and drug use.  For the brave only.

$REVIEW.: I don&#8217;t much write reviews here anymore, but thought it might benefit one or two people considering watching this film to know it will be a complete waste of their time.  I&#8217;m not new to Japanese cinema or Kurosawa.  I lived in Japan for 17 years, have watched many Japanese films, seen most of Kurosawa&#8217;s movies, and am not afraid to say this ranks as one of his worst.  The film starts out with the improbable conceit that a crowd of uninvited reporters and photographers are allowed into a private wedding banquet.  In the real world they would be asked to leave.  I was willing to set that aside in the belief that the film would improve, but it becomes one string of improbabilities after another &#8211; a young man seeking revenge for his father&#8217;s death caused by a company president assumes a false identity, is employed by the company, becomes the president&#8217;s personal secretary, marries the president&#8217;s daughter, then plots to expose their corruption.  The story is so poorly conceived that it&#8217;s impossible to relate to any of the characters, who are in any case drawn so broadly as to be caricatures.  And at 2.5 hours, the film is torturous after the first hour.  Even The Idiot, even The Most Beautiful, are better than this awful excuse for a movie.  If you have a choice, skip it.

$review_text.: As one who seeks intelligence in film, I enjoyed hitting the long ball in selecting this work. It is the prize of scholarship sought and sometimes won by education, all unabashedly depicted in original, colorful and somewhat funky, creative lines. Very British, the story examines education and coming of age in the world of intellectual and academic pursuit.Whereas, short of Dead Poet's Society, the Hollywood examination of school life is shallow and crass; this film, without neglecting the efficacy of humor, pierces silly bantering and successfully reveals the conflict and eventual realization that sometimes comes with change or graduation.I'll watch this again, and I highly recommend it to others.

$review_text.: "America-Freedom to Fascism" is a superb and surprisingly down to earth documentary that is not just another example of a "black helicopter" government conspiracy paranoia screed.  It is filled with cold hard facts that ones will find impossible to refute and also contains some solid, bonafide history on the Federal Reserve System and the Income Tax, which can be found nowhere in the law books stating that Americans must pay it.  Also, the information regarding the National ID Card is valid and if people think that the Globalists and their plan of a One-World Government is in the realms of science fiction, then they need to do some serious research.  And what better way to do this than to start by viewing down to earth information such as presented in this DVD?  Please, don't listen to the one-star reviewers or even the five-star reviewers on this one, and above all, don't even take my word for it.  Watch the DVD and judge for yourself.

$REVIEW.: If a movie can be deemed a "Thriller" or a "Mystery" this would be it,people who have seen Nolan's work(with the exception of Dark Knight)The Prestige being a prime example and a movie I enjoyed more than this.I am not sure if it is Guy Pearce(not his performance) or the back and fourth of the plot,Joe Pantoliano puts in a good performance,it is a sad movie to me really and a bizarre one.I was pleasantly surprised by a cameo by Thomas Lennon(Lt.Dangle of Reno 911!),I think the idea of the movie and the story is right,but the overall execution of the film and especially the ending is what keeps me from even bothering to wrap my noodle around it once more or even bother to question it,I am not a lazy movie guy or a simpleton but I think sometimes people want to make something seem "Intelligent" when overall it is a regurgitated story going over and over again,That's not to say my experience or feelings about it takes anything from the work on the contrary many would be intrigued and might even like it,I neither like it nor hate it, I am indifferent towards the movie.

$review_text.: Anyone looking for a typical fast action Western or cowboy movie should look elsewhere. This film is different.Jesse James emerged from the guerilla bushwacking version of the Civil War in Missouri to become a notorious bank and train robber after the Confederate defeat. But despite a romantic image as the last rebel fighter, a Robin Hood who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor, Jesse James was actually just a violent outlaw, in it for himself.This film opens with the final robbery by the James gang in 1879, followed by the departure of Jesse's older brother Frank. The camera work, especially at the beginning and towards the end, is sometimes outstanding, film as art. The story is very slow moving, a lot of conversation, with occasional bursts of violence, in a way that feels very real. It takes a while to work out exactly who the gang hangers-on are, and how some of them are related to each other.Rather than a Robin Hood, Jesse James is brilliantly portrayed by Brad Pitt as an increasingly paranoid killer. His murder of former gang members he believes plan to turn him in for the reward, and a falling out between two of the outlaws over one sleeping with the stepmother of the other, ultimately leads to Bob Ford and his brother Charlie planning to kill Jesse, as they stay with him while he hides out under the name of Thomas Howard. The scene is played as if Jesse knew what was coming and let it happen on purpose, turning his back on an armed Bob Ford. There's a feeling of Jesus and Judas in "Jesus Christ Superstar", but there's little indication why the unpredictable Jesse has chosen this course.The Ford brothers get little satisfaction in the end, with Robert Ford going down in history as "The dirty little coward who shot Mr. Howard". Mary-Louise Parker has a far too small role as Jesse's wife Zee.

$REVIEW.: Many people accuse Greenaway of being too cerebral, too cold and dyseptic a filmmaker


 Those who think that should check this film out, one of his best films and buoyed by an extraordinary performance by Brian Dennehy.The film concerns itself with Stourley Cracklite (played by Dennehy), an architect from Chicago who is putting on an exhibition dedicated to Etienne-Louis Boullee, a little known but visionary architect (Boulle was a real architect by the way)


 One would generally not expect an actor like Dennehy to fit in perfectly with Greenaway's universe, but Dennehy manages to do it with aplomb

 Dennehy is also a stage actor (which is much respected for), and Greenaway's long take style really fits well with him, as theater actors are able to concentrate much more than strictly film actors, and are able to sustain emotions for longer periods of time.Greenaway's mise en scene is fascinating throughout, especially the shots of the actual exhibition, which are really striking


 Dennehy's overpowering performance really makes you feel for him, and it gives it a more humanistic edge than much of Greenaway's work, which can be overly cerebral and cold at times


 The supporting players are generally good, except for Chloe Webb, who is just OK in her role as Cracklite's cheating wife
 Sacha Vierny's cinematography is magnificent througout, Greenaway's framing is impeccable as usual, and the film is arguably Greenaway's most moving film

 Despite a miscast Webb, the film is practically perfect.



$SUMMARY.: A Greenaway masterpiece, his most humanistic film, with an extraordinary performance by Brian Dennehy...

It has already been stated how the episodes are out of order. Totally annoying unless you don't mind switching discs back and forth to view them in proper order. Otherwise the episodes don't make sense, and the previously on... at the beginning of each episode is a spoiler for upcoming episodes that should have come earlier. Also, you will need to print out the episode list from the internet just to know the proper sequence. It is just totally screwed up and shows the disregard Disney execs have for their customers.

 He interviews her closest friends who turn out to be possible suspects - her mentor and aging radio star (Clifton Webb), her fiance (Vincent Price), and her aunt.What a wonderful movie this is
 Otto Preminger has directed a sophisticated and dreamlike who-dun-it with a big twist
 Andrews is a sympathetic leading man as the tough detective who falls in love with Laura's portrait

 Tierney is perfect as the strong, late Laura, the woman adored by the aging prig (sublime performance by Webb) and the charming leech (Price, playing against his later horror-type)


 The plot will keep you guessing until the end.The "Laura theme" is unforgettable and you'll be humming it for days

 It's moody and thrilling and bittersweet

$REVIEW.: The four episodes that make up the mini &quot;Oniwabanshu Arc&quot; are simply the best of the Tokyo Arc.  This is the conflict which caused Aoshi to lose his sanity.  Although the DVD doesn't include episode 8, the storyline is still strong and narration provides a brief recap of previous scenes.In episodes 9-11, we are introduced to Takani Megumi, a young doctor who has escaped from the evil druglord Takada Kanryuu.  Working for Kanryuu, is the cold and handsome Shinomori Aoshi, leader of the Oniwabanshu.  It's up to the Kenshin-gumi to save Megumi from Kanryuu, but to do that Kenshin'll have to defeat the surprisingly skilled Aoshi.The fight scenes between Kenshin and Aoshi are excellant and I love how Aoshi is portrayed as loyal and full of respect for his men, even though he's a &quot;bad guy&quot;.  Actually, I just love that fact that Aoshi's in the story (he's my favorite character).  These episodes are must see to further understand the conflict Kenshin and Aoshi have in the Kyoto Arc.Also, Episode 12 is a very nice episode concerning Yahiko's first fight protecting the meek Tsubame (I have no idea what her family name is).  Sweet humor throughout the episode, as Yahiko also deals with his first crush.

$REVIEW.: Creepy builds into ghastly and psycho-gothic.4  stars.THE FALL is called a mystery, but comes across dark and a thriller. It's a unique method of presenting a crime investigation. Music and cop's expressions while murders are contemplated are as eerie as the stalking sequences. So darkly drama there is no characters to empathize with--not even the cops. Not rated but consider it PG-18 to R and expect your own nightmares.SUBTITLES available for all 5 full-hour episodes.1--Murder of a Belfast female architect is unsolved, thus getting DS Stella Gi9bson (Gillian Anderson) on the case. Counselor Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan) plans his next attack. Yes, viewers know who-dun-it from the get-go. This series is about the journey and characters involved in the crime and investigation--and how they collide.2--Victims increase and DS Gibson gets assigned to investigate the similar murder. Serial seems certain. Another gal gets the focused attention of Spector.3--Gibson's sexual preference for a cop implodes after an assassination. Finally the murders are recognized as serial and Belfast's routine killer plans his next event.4--One murder victim case begins unraveling names, making some unhappy about discovery and publicity. More tragedy before a killer mistake that offers "Operation Music Man" a break. Will it be enough?5--Grisly murder alters the MO of the resent serial killings. Gibson's steps of inquiry creep nearer to solving and capturing the grim reaper.Multi-plot series not as yet interrelated. Will the 2nd season do that?For the dark thriller type of production obviously intended--they sure did excel in repulsive. A stomach churner for sure, but too many loose ends for 5 stars.Dorman acted so convincingly as a repugnant psychotic that he may be stuck in the role type for life; unless he shaves and bleaches his hair. He did the difficult job of flip-flopping bad man/good man.Anderson performs her own version of her character's efficient-emotionless-eerie.

$review_text.: First, Amazon needs to correct its CD / DVD track listings. W-A-Y off. The hot spots: Bounty Hunter, Fall Of The Peacemakers, Devil's Canyon, Beatin' The Odds, and Dreams I'll Never See alternate betweene pure bursts of adrenaline and bar-band lagging. Why the band decided that the coda to "Layla" was a fitting instrumental break for Molly Hatchet I'll never know (other than the fact that Duane Allman was a Domino...a forced "Southern Rock" connection, perhaps). You will hear a noticeable tempo shift in "Dreams"...fatigue at the end of the set, sloppiness, or something else? Finally, Phil McCormack's between-song patter is forced and painful. When he orders "Grandma" to "get up" for the SECOND time in "Dreams," it's a real groaner. The disc carries a parental advisory as the result of Phil repeatedly using "the F word" in an attempt to pump up the audience. If you want a hot CD by this edition of the band, get "Silent Reign Of Heroes." As far as this CD-DVD combo goes, it's a rock-solid 2 star effort.

$review_text.: I was just trying to get through an 11-hour overnight flight when I chose this film as an alternative to the endless action flicks and straight-to-video Hollywood selections. What a FABULOUS little film! An excellent cast, with an excellent premise about a beautiful woman from India--touchingly portrayed by the lovely Sridevi, in the kind of attractively vulnerable role often played by Julia Roberts-- who is taken for granted by her family, who treat her with derision for her inability to speak English.When she is sent alone to New York by her disrespectful husband, to perform a family duty, she is seen with new eyes by her fellow students in an English school in Manhattan, who recognize her as the gem that she is.The gorgeous Mehdi Nebbou--who was riveting in Steven Spielberg's "Munich"--is excellent as Laurent, the hunky French English student who falls for her--and gives her inattentive husband a serious run for his money.A bevy of charming cousins completes the cast, all the way to a heartwarming surprise finale. This is a very smart feel-good movie with a happy ending, with lots of beautiful Indian clothes and dancing. But it is also an excellent family film--for any age group or ethnicity--about family dynamics, and the need for spouses and children to respect and appreciate one another. And as Sridevi says, in her triumphant English speech, not be "judgmental."I'll look for this director--and I think this remarkable actress could seriously carry a meaty role in another independent film.
$SUMMARY.: LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!

$REVIEW.: Unlike the other Batman films I had seen at the time this came, this was excellent. It wasn't a sloggy mess like Batman: Gotham Knight, nor was it clogged with way too many characters like Superman/Batman Public Enemies, nor was it badly drawn like Batman vs. Dracula. This film was just right. It was well-drawn, had an understandable plot, a tense drama, a gripping story, yet made sense. The Red Hood comes to Gotham to clean up the town--lethally. To Batman he is another crime lord that needs to be taken in. It turns out to be Jason Todd, the second Robin, the one everyone assumed the Joker had killed. Ras al-Ghul had hired the Joker as a distraction for Batman t odeal with while al-Ghul pursues his own plans. But Ras felt sorry for Batman and decided to resurrect Jason Todd. But like the Frankenstein of old, Jason Todd after being resurrected becomes psychotic. Jason Todd becomes Red Hood and takes down Black Mask's gang. Black Mask becomes so desperate that he releases The Joker, who, naturally, wants first to kill Black Mask. But Black Mask survives. And it eventually comes down to Batman, Jason Todd, and The Joker, and an argument about morals why The Joker should die or shouldn't die. It finishes with everyone surviving. Only minor characters get killed. Joker, Jason, Batman, Black Mask all survive. And of course Ras al-Ghul, who blames himself for creating the situation and so has renounced crime and vows not to bother Batman again. All in all a nice story.

$review_text.: If beautiful people and horrible writing move you, by all means purchase this movie now and cry like there's no tomorrow.  This is an instant classic from the profitable teen cheese factory and delivers like a charm to those who LOVE teen weepies.  (For us others, we'll just suffer in silence, or, as I did, laugh really hard.)  The requisite ingredients - love triangle, terminal disease, poor boy/rich boy - push the plot along in the most predictable way imaginable.  Sam (Lelee Sobieski) and Jasper (Josh Hartnett) are happy in love, a superstar couple in their small town until Kelley (Chris Klein), the wealthy, out-of-town snot, comes crashing into the diner owned by Sam's parents.  As a punishment, he must rebuild the diner but with the help of our buddy Jasper, who also had a hand in the crash.  Before long, Sam eyes that hunky Kelley because, hey, who wouldn't fall for a mysterious rich kid?  While the two boys wage their testosterone war, Sam discovers she has cancer.  Uh-oh!This movie is a big disappointment because it fails to capitalize on a relatively talented cast and a pseudo-inspiring story.  Rather than developing characters instead of caricatures, the filmmakers opted for the easy, fast cash route.  As a result, the dialogue seems to be spun from a 13 year old's soap opera fantasy, befitting of the target audience I suppose.  Nothing innovative or inspiring comes about, leaving the audience with zero originality to warm to; this total lack of emotional investment keeps the movie distant and empty.  You could say it offers ever-important life lessons to the female jr. high crowd.  They undoubtedly appreciate the fine merits of this film that those in the general population seem to have missed

THIER FRIENDS AND SO ON..i have heard several of my friends make comparisons to "NEAR DARK" (sans vampires)... and i can see where they get that....this movie is heavy on style it might lack a little substance in the plot line but none the less is thoroughly entertaining.as i am jonesing to watch it again i may have to get another copy...and with the price being just a little more than a rental i may get several copies to distribute to my friends so that they can enlist for what is sure too be a big cult movie.....but not with my copy!

$review_text.: &quot;Chocolat&quot; is a movie based on Joanne Harris's novel of the same name. I recommend experiencing both.This movie is visually stunning with alot of work having been done to perfect the scenery so that the viewer is transported into a quaint little French Town. The musical score is upbeat and passionate which adds a special dimension to the film.Johnny Depp does an excellent job as the gypsy drifter that is greeted with reserve and prejudice by the uptight townspeople. Juliette Binoche plays the single woman with child who blows into town with a wind and leaves it in stiches. She opens a chocolate shop and falls prey to the overly religious mayor of the town because she entices others to sin during lent. I have to say that my favorite character is played by Dame Judy Dench, she is the free spirit of the town refusing in all of her years to be programmed by the rest of the world. She indulges in the delicious chocolate despite being diabetic and scolded by doctors and her own daughter. The chocolate becomes its own character managing to magically cure all of the towns ills if they allow it to work its sweet way into their deepest desires.A sweetly sinful indulgence indeed!!

$REVIEW.: Hellcats of the Navy, 1957 filmAdmiral Chester Nimitz tells about an operation to attack Japan in her home waters. Commander Casey Adams is in charge of the submarine &#8220;Starfish&#8221;, a &#8220;Hellcat&#8221; submarine. They have to evade the minefields and capture a Japanese mine so the Navy can study it. [Notice the relaxed and less formal dress code.] Frogmen with air tanks leave the submarine under water to capture two mines. They remove the prongs that would trigger an explosion. But one man is lost! There is a warning about an approaching enemy warship, they must dive now! One man is abandoned to save the rest. They launch torpedoes and hit one ship. The other drops depth charges. Sailors celebrate with photographs. [You never saw this in earlier movies.] Commander Adams explains his decision; it wasn&#8217;t personal. A young sailor gives his opinion: &#8220;I did see him!&#8221;These Japanese mines are covered with rubber to deflect sonar. [A cleverness that would be shown later with electronics and automobiles.] Commander Adams converses with a divorced nurse. The Navy runs tests with dummy mines; can they be detected? The new circuit works! Sailors roll dice gambling. &#8220;Combinations and permutations&#8221; show why mathematics is important in real life. One sailor explains the money and dice found on the deck! An accident provides drama and a return to port. Adams gets sealed orders for a special mission: a raiding party on a small enemy island near the Tsushima Straights. Sailors wear helmets and carry M1 carbines. An enemy guard is silenced. Explosive charges detonate the oil storage tanks ahead of schedule. [This provides action.] Enemy cannons fire at the submarine.&#8220;Clear the deck!&#8221; One shot damages the submarine, they take corrective action. But the water level rises! They now have a chart through the mine fields. The enemy detected them and fires on them in the dark. &#8220;Abandon ship!&#8221; Adams is the last to leave. A Navy airplane spots the survivors, they are rescued. But sixty men were lost. A Naval Board of Inquiry holds a hearing on the loss of the &#8220;Starfish&#8221;. Adams tells why Landon was rejected for a command position. [Do you agree?] A wounded sailor asks about the others. Adams explains his decision to follow that merchant ship and chart the minefield. Landon testifies as to the facts. Admiral Lockwood agrees with the Board&#8217;s decision. There is a plan to attack Japanese shipping as a prelude to their defeat. &#8220;Good hunting!&#8221; Adams goes to sea with a new boat.They enter enemy seas that are filled with mines. &#8220;Rig for silent running.&#8221; An enemy destroyer drops depth charges. Their boat runs at 200 feet below the surface to evade the minefield. On June 9 they attack the enemy. [A coordinated attack is a force multiplier.] They are attacked in turn. The Captain goes over the side to cut the cable snagging the boat. [Believable?] A enemy destroyer is seen. &#8220;Bring her down.&#8221; Torpedoes are launched and hit the enemy. When they surface they rescue Captain Adams. There is a happy ending.This is more of an educational drama than an entertainment. The name of &#8220;Abbott&#8221; suggests a low budget. The funniest part is when a sailor explains what they are doing with the coins and dice on the deck! In war decisions are made to benefit the whole group rather than individuals. The loss of a ship is very bad, it is harder to replace than the trained sailors who work this machine.

$REVIEW.: If you really want to scare someone, don't tell them another &quot;guy with a hook&quot; campfire story. Skip the urban legends and cheesy ghost story fare. Because what really scares people is real life.Go through the list of every possible way to die in any given situation. Mention how easy it is for a plane engine to fail, or a car to break an essential part. Comment on the plethora of common household items that, if they were to be involved in just the right coincidences, might result in your death.If you really want to scare someone, take them to Final Destination.The lead character, a high schooler named Alex Browning, is waiting on-board an international flight to Paris along with almost 40 of his classmates. During the wait, Alex has a premonition that the plane is going to blow up. He ditches the flight, taking several classmates and a teacher with him in the broil his panic incites. These precious few have their lives changed when, sure enough, the airplane explodes just after claiming the skies.The premise: those people were supposed to die, and now Death is simply getting caught up on his list. This means there is no killer, there is no hockey-masked looney with a rubber knife. There is a slight breeze, a brief, anamolous shadow, and then, you're dead.The craftsmanship here is excellent. The deaths are all very disturbing, all very real, and all very brutal, and the effect is nauseatingly refreshing. We don't see hysterical people running up the stairs to escape a never-tired creep, or jabbing meat thermometers into supernatural critters. We see a pattern of easily explained, perfectly normal, lethally designed events that not only cause death, but also adapt to the victim's movements. No matter where they go, death is at their heels, following them in the endless coincidences. And it's all the more terrifying because it's supposed to happen, and there's no one to fight. The most any of the characters can hope for is that Alex will predict it and, perhaps, intervene in time. Needless to say, Alex's track record for saving his friends drops drastically post-plane crash.The acting, though excellent, is a bit forced at points, and there are parts of the movie created solely to pad the film. A cringe-worthy expository interlude with a cheesy mortician and some repetitive dialogue are the only weak links in the show, however. The very concept of the flick is so interesting that it laminates all the duller moments.The premise is, of course, self-destructive. Death can't die so no matter how many times the characters manage to cheat the traps that seem to be laid for them, sooner or later, the chain of events will be set in motion all over again. It doesn't end until they die. This type of problem might have crippled most horror movies, but Final Destination cleverly eludes the chance of a weak and long-overdue ending by cashing in on the repetitive &quot;tag-you're-dead&quot; quality of the plot. It ends with the understanding that it hasn't ended.Not for the squeamish of heart, this movie is a landmark in the horror movie genre. Although it's not going to win any Oscars anytime soon, this well-timed and moodily constructed film does exactly what movies are intended to do: it entertains. It reveals the possibility that villains are all well and good, but the true horror lies in real death, in a murderer that exists in every inanimate object you come across.Oooh. Scary, huh?

$review_text.: Contact is a film about the battle to get to space, and what we might find there. It's not attempting to prove or disprove God, or the value of science. It's not trying to tell us that all politicians or priests are  bad. And it's not trying to be &quot;Lost in Space&quot;.What  &quot;Contact&quot; is: a moderately thoughtful and carefully constructed  essay on possible first contact and problems therein. It's got some cheesy  mechanics in it (love-story, arbitrary ending), but, frankly, you expect  that. It does provide beautiful and, more importantly, integral special  effects, and some nice acting from a few cast members. Not all, mind  you.I find it difficult to believe that anyone who watches this film  with tolerance and an open mind could object to it. Obsessive Christians'  only complaint might be that there are atheists in the movie. Grow up -  there are atheists in real life. Obsessive scientists might have trouble  with depictions of science as faith. Get real - the issue isn't science,  but personal belief.If you can shed a few preconceptions, and are  willing to watch something a little deeper than &quot;Batman and  Robin&quot;, then you should enjoy &quot;Contact&quot;. If not, then just  don't watch it. But you'll be missing out on an important debate.

$review_text.: Torchwood Children of Earth has a very British perspective and psyche. As such the government conspiracy and cover-up theme may be relevant to the British today (look at their government scandals) but has been done to death with the likes of X-Files and Millennium in the 1990s by the Americans. The premise of the show and the choices of the government are therefore not very credible to me, perhaps because I find it hard to believe that any government even the British government would stoop so low or surrender so easily to an alien menace, whose capacity for destruction was not even proven, but merely hinted at for most of the mini-series.There was no demonstration of the viciousness of the "456" or the futility of resistance sufficient for me to agree that the government had no choice but to comply with the "ransom" demands. As such, they seem to capitulate too easily, and is perhaps a personal (or British) bias that their government is feckless, spineless, and not to be trusted.Political commentary in entertainment can be very satisfying when done right, and done intelligently. When done badly, they are as welcomed (and as subtle) as evangelists at your door when you're about to sit down to dinner. Or a Michael Moore movie. But at least with a Michael Moore documentary, you know what you're buying.As such, I'm very sorry but Children of Earth is a rather parochial morality tale that may not resonate with most people outside the British Isles, though the show may re-kindle some of the passion of die-hard X-philes.

$review_text.: Despite having read the liner notes, I thought from the publicity artwork that WINTERSET would be something gothic.  It is gothic, in its bleakness, but is squarely centered in the Depression era of the United States.  It was completely of it's time, and considering that the film was adapted from the Broadway play, it must have been daring, with sub themes of socialism and police corruption.  (The play was by Maxwell Anderson, who wrote KEY LARGO and THE BAD SEED.)  Perhaps that contributed to the film receiving two Academy Award nominations.This is the story of Mio (Bartholomio - a young, dewy Burgess Merideth) trying to clear his father's name.  In the first scenes, his namesake Father, played with riveting stillness by the painfully thin John Carradine, was accused of murder he did not commit, given no defense, and put to death.  Years later, his son goes to the slums of New York to try to find out the truth.I had to remind myself that this was made in 1936, so it is still very early in the talkies.  The sets are a wonderful blend of realism and expressionism (similar to the famous stage sets of Arthur Miller's A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE), giving this a gothic noir flavor.  Rain is often used as a "purifier" in stage and film, but here it is effectively used to create an oppressive humidity, a torrent of sludge.  It is clear that film noir, Orson Wells, and THE THIRD MAN's Director Carol Reed all owe a debt to early films like this.  The set elements are all here in tight proximity, the stone, the shadowed doorways, the waterways.In fact, one irony is that one of the lead actors does look very much like Orson Wells.  He plays the brother of Mariama (played by Margot, who is probably best known as the duplicitous woman in Capra's LOST HORIZON).  Margot's transition to film is not as ideal as Merideth's, her style is more of the old school careful vocal production that may be the product of overcoming an accent.  But she looks luminous and innocent, and fills the screen with a simple hopefulness at odds with the dark surroundings.  The villain of the piece is simply fantastic... completely believably sociopathic without any extravagant ticks or frothing at the mouth.This is pre-method-acting, but that spare realism is all here, especially in the performances of Carradine and Merideth.  This entire film holds up as a moment of history - of social themes and thought of that day that still resonate.  The Broadway cast seems to have been lifted intact (which should be a lesson to modern filmmakers to use stage actors instead of vice-verse).  There are one or two flowery monologues, but for the most part, the transition from stage to film goes very well, and the story and script are spare and universal enough to stand the test of time well.  This is a fascinating moment of film history which has -luckily - made its way to DVD.

Eddie and the Cruisers was a classic, but Eddie Lives was a better film!  It was just as we remembered it...seeing it many years ago.  We are thoroughly pleased!!!

$review_text.: My major shortcoming as a devotee of martial arts movies is that I'm not a fan of Bruce Lee's films: classy as they may be, they were made in a time before onscreen kung fu had developed to my preferred standard, and I'm just not a fan of 1970s media in general. With that said, it's impossible not to be fascinated by the man's life and his contributions to the martial arts, and as far as I'm concerned, this 1993 Hollywood movie does a very good job at displaying both - at least a much better one than the few low-budget Hong Kong renderings I've seen. Is the movie flawless? - no. Is it 100% factually accurate? - far from it. But what the film does right is majestically portray the Dragon's life as the nonstop adventure that most of us believe it was while building him up as a truly admirable figure. When it comes to someone like Bruce, I don't think it's improper to flatter him a bit.The film begins with Bruce Lee beginning his kung fu training in China before jumping ahead to his immigration to America, where he teaches martial arts, finds love, combats the race barrier, and ascends to his film career; and the movie ends with him filming the final shot ofEnter the Dragon. Universal Studios' choice to play Bruce was an interesting one: at the time, Hawaiian-Chinese actor Jason Scott Lee was a small-name performer whose most noteworthy credit at the time was a bit part inBack to the Future Part IIand who hadn't studied the martial arts before. With a multitude of Bruce Lee-lookalikes still on-hand from the "Bruceploitation" period following the original Lee's death, it's weird that the studio would choose someone who only looked partially like him and had never even lived in China. With that said, I ultimately don't think it was a bad choice: Jason has a good deal of Bruce's mannerisms down pat, and he managed to replicate Lee's impressive physique more accurately than anyone else I've seen.The way Lee has been written in the film is likely a cause for dissent among some viewers, but I have no problem with it. While the real-life Lee - as we see in his films and interviews - always exuded self-assurance that bordered on arrogance (though justifiably so), Lee in the film is much more open to emotion and more than once completely loses his cool; but keep in mind that the film is based off of his wife Linda Lee Caldwell'sbiographyon him, so it's reasonable that Lee is presented in a more personal, vulnerable light here. He's not the impassive man-god that a lot of people seem to regard him as, but in trade-off, he's much more likeable than I perceived him as in archived footage.The film is written in a way that it presents Lee to the audience from the ground up, detailing most important events in his life - a major improvement over fare likeBruce Lee: The Man and the Myththat hops around his life's timeline, assuming you know what's happened in-between. With that said, some of the changes the filmmakers made to history serve no purpose (e.g. renaming Jesse Glover as Jerome Sprout and replacing Wong Jack Man with a fictional character), so some credit is definitely lost. Also, I'm not pleased with the subplot wherein Bruce regularly is faced with a giant demon that only he can see (played by stuntman Sven Ole-Thorsen,Gladiator). Obviously this is meant to be symbolic and metaphorical to Lee's struggle with his inner demons - a point touched on frequently in the film - but it feels out of place when the rest of the movie has played things so down-to-earth. It would've been fine if these encounters were brief, like the one following the funeral of Lee's father, but when Lee and the giant actually start fighting, it feels like a bad psychedelic trip.Speaking of fighting, that's one thing I can't find fault with. "Dragon" isn't the first martial arts film I saw, but it is the one that made me realize how cool the martial arts could be in movies. Not all of the seven showdowns are fantastic, but they're all grandly presented and the choreography was really superior for Hollywood at the time. The second-to-last fight, wherein the real-life confrontation on the set ofFists of Furyis recreated with Malaysian martial artist Hans Ong (Bloodsport 2), is an absolute showstopper and still constitutes one of my favorite brawls of all time. Jason Scott Lee deserves particular credit: though there's a bit of doubling to be seen throughout the film, his effort and natural athletic talent shows to the point that I wouldn't have been able to guess that the film was his first excursion with martial arts. The style of the choreography is far removed from both that of the real Lee's movies and from what Lee taught his students, but I really don't care - these fights are good, plain and simple.I can't find anything wrong with the direction of Rob Cohen (xXx). After proving that he can do a serious but cool piece like this, it's sort of disappointing that he entrenched himself in a world of explosions and computer graphics subsequently, but in retrospect, I'm pleased that a filmmaker who's obviously so in-tune with the Hollywood action scene had the subtlety and perception to pull off a flattering biographical piece like this. Maybe the five-star Bruce Lee biopic is still out there, waiting to be made, but as far as I'm concerned, this one is a fine enough film to wait alongside of. I recommend it to all martial arts fans in general.

I always thought it was greatto have Hercules portrayed as his older self and not in the samebeefcake manner traditionally presented at that time(Speaking ofthis film raised the bar for sword &amp; fantasy to follow (none everreaching it's status &quot;Hercules in the haunted world&quot; &quot;Goliath andthe Dragon&quot; to name a few) I only gave the dvd 4 stars because oflack of the &quot;HarryHausen Chronicles&quot; and the ORIGINAL trailer.

$review_text.: John Steinbeck's mammoth generational saga of the Salinas Valley was ill-served by the theatrical film starring James Dean, which only covers the last 150 pages of a 600-page novel.  That film is good in its own right, but as an adaptation of the book, it leaves a lot to be desired.This 1981 TV miniseries rectifies this.  We get the whole story, which covers three generations of Trasks and Hamiltons, from the Indian Wars to World War I, from Connecticut to California.  The two characters who form the moral and philosophical center of the story, Sam Hamilton and Lee, are restored to the narrative.Jane Seymour gives a star-making performance as Cathy, depicting to perfection the eerie combination of sensual beauty and cold hostility to human feeling that makes this character so fascinating.  Sam Bottoms triumphs over James Dean in the role of Cal Trask, one of Cathy's abandoned sons.  Lloyd Bridges and Soon-Tek Oh are magnificent as Sam and Lee, the two philosophers (both missing from the James Dean film).  The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent.This was only broadcast once, and until now was only briefly available in uncut form on a slow-speed VHS that was in print for a few months.  Now, at last, it's on DVD, and while the picture quality is not very good, perhaps due to the source, at least the whole movie is there on a durable format.  Perhaps the source materials were in such poor condition that Acorn didn't have the resources for remastering. Normally, I'd give it five stars, but I'm disappointed enough in the video quality to knock my rating down a notch.

$review_text.: What can you say - one of the best classic TV westerns. The first season of Gunsmoke was a half hour B/W format. Episode 26 (Hack Prine) you will notice a few "different" things (the office and Long Branch are different). This episode was the pilot but for some reason they didn't show it until closer to the end of the season.  I enjoyed the fact the opening sequences are of Matt Dillon walking on boot hill and hearing his "thoughts". Enjoy some of the all time classic western characters - (of course) Matt Dillon, Miss Kitty, Doc, and most of all Chester.The first season does NOT have English Subtitles for the hearing impaired.  39 episodes  Very entertaining show.

$REVIEW.: Set in the 4th century A.D. in Alexandria, "Agora" follows the fall of the Pagans as the newly empoweredand growing Christian movement took over. On a political and historical level the film works well, with interestingswipes at the destructive power of religious fanaticism (Pagans, Jews and Christians all have some very badmoments here), and obvious parallels to today, when extremists of various faiths can still be seento be taking making some of the same kind of violent attacks on those they see as wrong or other, as well asdis-empowering women, denying science and distorting scriptures to justify violence or oppression.On a human level the film is a bit more rocky. The story centers on Hypatia, a female teacher, philosopher andscientist who, at least at the start of the film, is given the same level of respect as a great male thinker - somethingthat seems very rare in the world of the film. She is outspoken in preaching brotherhood, and always unbowed in herpursuit of knowledge.Rachel Weisz does good work in the role, but I wish the film hadn't made her so glamorous in look and feel, whichseems like a movie conceit, a bit at odds with the character. More important, the movie feels slowed and weigheddown by the stories of the various men trying to romance Hypatia, in spite of her seeming indifference to romanticentanglements and her almost monk like devotion to knowledge. It's not that these sub- plots are bad, they're justmuch less interesting and more pro forma than the far less familiar historical, scientific and social material and storylines that surround them.Amenebar is without question one of our most talented directors, so when he makes a film that doesn't reach the heightsof "The Sea Inside" or "The Others" or "Open Your Eyes" in can't help but feel a little disappointing. But that doesn't meanit's not worth seeing.  His slight misfire hear still beats most of what's out there handily.

$REVIEW.: If there are 500 words spoken in this film, it is only just barely. Everything about this movie is sparse and barren. But the filmography (shot on location in Chutkotka) is absolutely beautiful, and the tension between the protagonists palpable throughout.Young Pavel (Grigory Dobrygin) and the experienced meteorological station chief Sergei (Sergei Puskepalis) are serving out the final months of the outpost's transition from a continuously manned polar station to one monitored soley by computers. There is mounting tension between the plodding, time-worn way of experience (Sergei), and the impatient, sensory-bludgeoned, lazy way of youth (Pavel). And, just as they are finding a way to smooth their differences, Pavel withholds some critical news from Sergei for reasons that are not entirely clear (but one suspects mainly out of fear). Then things spin out of control.While the ending could have been smoother and some character traits sharpened, this is a fine film (available on Netflix) that has the added plus of offering both harrowing and beautiful images of northern Siberia.As reviewed inRussian Life

$review_text.: After completing three urban/adult animated films, Ralph Bakshi wanted to branch out and do something that he had never done before: a family film. he shifted his focus from the seedy underbelly of modern New York to Tolkienesque fantasy realms. Wizards is the film that sprang forth from Bakshi's mind.The world the film is set in is thousands or millions of years in the future, as the world recovers from a nuclear holocaust. There are a re two main areas on earth now. Skorch, the badlands, is a radiated wasteland filled with mutants and orc-like creatures. Then, there is Montagar, a land where the land has healed and where sprang fairies, elves, and other magical creatures.The story concerns two brothers, Avatar and Blackwolf. The brothers are diametrically opposite of each other. Avatar is good and kind, while Blackwolf is evil with a thirst for power. As each of Blackwolf's attempts to conquer Montagar fails, he digs up ancient Nazi propaganda to inspire his mutant army, which it does very successfully. To combat this, Avatar, his elf-warrior Weehawk, his pupil/love interest Princess Elinore, and a former robot assassin named Peace go off to Skorch to destroy the projector that plays the inspiring propaganda.Okay, this film is a step down from Bakshi's earlier films. I think the main reason for this is because Bakshi was in a new element. His previous films were urban and modern, whereas the fantasy worlds of Montagar and Skorch require a different approach. Bakshi is not very successful in that respect. The dialogue in the film shifts from modern urban talk to Tolkienesque vernacular often within the same scene. There is not a good balance between the modern and the fantastic. Avatar is supposed to be a great wizard, but he talks like Peter Falk, wheras Weehawk sounds like he just came out of The Hobbit. Elinore falls somewhere in-between.Secondly, the story is a bit of a mess. We have the basic element of the two warring brothers, but it's the other elements added in that drag it down. Would old Nazi propaganda or other materials and relics of the 20th century survive that long into the future, especially after a nuclear holocaust? That's kind of hard to buy, but if you're in the right mod, you can overlook it. Added on to that, Ralph tries to fit in a lot of ideas and themes in the film, but he doesn't know how to make them mesh well. He tries to fit religious (especially Jewish) imagery, somehow trying to make a statement on the plight of Jews or something, but it all adds up to nothing. He tries to make the film an anti-overreliance on technology, but that gain is muddled and not handled well. There's no establishment for the conflict between science and magic. Next, there are scenes and lot elements that don't add up. Peace disappears from the film for about 10-15 minutes, but we're never told or shown what happened during that time.However, despite these shortcomings, the film does have strong aspects to it. The artwork in the film is wonderful, with fantastic backgrounds for Skorch provided by British illustrator Ian Miller. The backgrounds are nice and detailed, as contrasted with the natural, organic feel of the backgrounds of Montagar. Also, the animation is pretty good, despite some moments of weakness and lack of pencil testing or planning. Also, Bakshi had comic-book artist Mike Ploog draw some history scenes, where there was no animation, but still images explaining the backstory. They work beautifully and feel just right, meaning they fit in the film. The music also serves the film well, quietly underscoring the action without distracting us from it.The film's greatest strength are the battle scenes. It beautifully mixes cel-animation and rotoscope. Bakshi takes stock footage to his advantage. Painting over the stock footage gave the battle scenes an otherworldly feeling. The soldiers looked dark and menacing, which gives it just the right feeling. Besides that, the battles are wonderfully staged and choreographed, and it gives the feeling that Bakshi is paying homage to the great fantasy illustrators, such as his good friend Frank Frazetta. In fact, some portions of the battle scenes are taken directly from Frazetta paintings. The editing, animation, rotoscope, and music make those scenes damn near perfect.In the end, the whole is not as good as its individual parts. A bold experiment, but a mediocre film.

In this regard, "Walk the Line" is nothing special but as a love story, it is wonderful from the first time young Johnny Cash and June Carter met during the show and she got strapped in his guitar until his proposal many years later on the stage (the only place she allowed him to talk to her)

Both Phoenix and Witherspoon deserved the highest praise for their performances that were heartfelt, beautiful, sincere, and emotional

I never been a huge fan of Reese even though I always admitted that she had the acting talent ("Election") but with her role in "Walk the Line" and with her acceptance speech, she has earned my respect and admiration
Phoenix was as good as Reese and the chemistry between them was absolutely real.

$review_text.: In Short:Pros:1: Solid and unique storyline revolves around social elements with good beginning and end and no prolonged dull moments.2: Appeal beyond strict special effects wizardry and sci-fi aspects.3: Excellent special effects and futuristic society depiction (this movie does depict the World Trade Center Twin Towers existing far in the future).4: A mixture of humor and serious cinema makes for a well rounded cinematic experience.5: When it comes to PG-13 movies many modern movies are much closer to R than to PG.  This movie is closer to a genuine PG-13 with scenes wholly appropriate to children without explanation while others will possibly provoke a family conversation about relationships, fairness, and parent/child love & loss.Cons:Nothing significant in my opinion.One of the central elements of this movie is the question of what constitutes life?  Given the ever increasing pace at which computer and other sciences are advancing some of the issues that are broached in this film may well come up in many peoples lifetimes.  Sure it's not likely to be exactly as depicted but quite frankly I don't write it off completely.I think this movie is a classic and I recommend it.This is the story of a synthetic boy built by a future multinational as an alternative to having real children.  The world is a different place in the future with global warming having significantly melted the icecaps and flooded the coastal areas and radiation causing a rise in disease and infertility.  Androids are nothing new to this future society in fact they are cheaper than human beings and have largely replaced them as domestic servants and workers.  Most humans are forced to live on meager stipends while an elite develops the technology that drives the world economy such as androids.As a test subject the company building this new revolutionary product offers it to an employee's family with a son suffering from an illness for which there is no cure (he is in stasis pending a cure at the movie's start).  While at first reluctant and even spooked the grieving mother eventually takes the synthetic child in to her home.  The process involves imprinting the face of the mother on the boys artificial consciousness and is irreversible, once done the boy will love the mother and treat her as his mother for eternity.  The boy never grows never changes he just loves his mommy in perpetuity.Then a partial cure is found for the biological child and he is released from the futuristic hospital although still not 100% and aided by technology.  Initially they keep both boys but the biological one begins to be cruel to the artificial child immediately.  At the "real" boys birthday party his friends all seem to have picked up on his attitude toward his artificial sibling as being little better than a fancy talking teddy bear toy which he also owns and is cruel to (and he is the artificial child's best friend).  One of the children at the party decides to cut the android to see what he does and triggers a terror reflex with both the real child and synthetic sibling going into the pool and sinking like a stone because the terrorized robot is clinging hysterically to the real boy.This is the turning point in the movie because the mother decides to get rid of the robot boy and drives him into the woods and abandons him there.  Remember that the boy is fixated on his mother figure and so begins a never-ending quest to become a real boy Pinocchio fashion.  His love of his mother is absolute and does not diminish or waver despite being thrown away.The synthetic child quickly falls into an underground world where discarded robots are hunted down for parts and destroyed by angry economically displaced humans who are generally hostile and cruel to synthetics.  He begins his odyssey to become "real" with his trusty talking teddy bear at his side and the aid of a lover boy android in black synthetic leather.  The comparison between the boy and the gigolo drives home that the boy is supposed to be very special because people have a hard time telling he is in fact synthetic (the robot haters throw rotting vegetables at the man who wants to destroy him because he is crying and terrified in one scene).  Joe Gigolo leaves little doubt as to what he is however and he is pretty amusing.It's an unusual movie really and the closest comparison I can think of is Bicentennial Man but I like this one better.  It may be because it's a story about a child that never grows up and never stops loving.  That is what is really the central aspect of his Artificial Intelligence is the love of his mother figure and the desire to win redemption in her eyes.I recommend it for parents who would like to see a touching story and I recommend it for sci-fi fans as it is a unique movie and storyline and very different from most movies.  It might be harder for younger children to understand everything but they just might surprise you too so I would say it is a movie for families.

Still, even though the Cinderella plot is not originial, the movie is fun to watch and a good show. Julie Andrews is delightful as the Grandmother and I was reminded of why she was once upon a time the highest paid actor in all of Hollywood (that's counting both men and women). Mia, played by Anne Hathaway, is just your average nerdy fifteen-year-old suffering through private school when she learns that she is the heir to the Genovian throne. Hence the title, &quot;Princess Diaries.&quot; The revelation requires Mia to learn how to act the princess part and this is the best part of the film - the princess lessons. Everything is wrapped up in a suitably happy Disney ending. The whole family will enjoy this film but young girls and grandmoms will love it.

$REVIEW.: And this wraps it up; the glorious 1989-1996 seven season run of the best pay cable anthology show ever to grace the airwaves is finally complete on DVD.This season many feel lacked in detail but I completely disagree, there are quite a few gems in this finale, let me explain why it is a very unique finish to the series; the show moved production to the United Kingdom and used only a British cast of respected actors thus giving the series a different atmosphere to work with.Episodes such as "Cold War" with a young Ewan McGregor, "Horror in the Night" and "About Face" stand out just as worthy as any previous season classic.a great season and a must own.
$SUMMARY.: Love it!!!

$REVIEW.: Young vulcanologist goes to small town, scares the local businessmen with his talk of possible eruption; his own boss doesn't take him seriously and stupidly assures the local people that there is no danger; they go into the cone to take readings and almost die; feisty old person doesn't want to leave the mountain....how many more similarities do you need?Dante's Peak is more or less a re-write of St. Helens, the 1981 film with Art Carney. Of course, modern technology makes this a much more explosive, dramatic movie. Modern technology unfortunately can't make it less goofy.

$REVIEW.: This opera is greatly loved and it is easy to understand why.  Although it is quite long, it is full of fabulous music that nearly everyone loves.  There is humor, some real passion, with clearly drawn but interesting characters.This production is full of great performances and is easy to enjoy visually.  The camera keeps us involved without making us aware of its work.  The costumes are not overly colorful, but I like the subtlety - especially at 190 minutes!Gerald Finlay is a wonderful Figaro.  I love his voice and presence.  Alison Hagley has a wonderful voice and sings Susanna with great joy and she can act.  Renee Fleming is transcendent as The Countess.  Who can praise her enough?  She seems to glow and her voice transfixes me.  Andreas Schmidt is a wonderfully despicable Almaviva.The subtitles make it easy for non-Italian speaker who want to follow along to do so.  I played this performance for my 11 year-old daughter and 10 year-old son and wondered how long they would last.  I thought I would just expose them to the opera.  They were mesmerized and didn't want to even take a break between tapes.  They were caught up in the story and watching it happen made it much more enjoyable for them than just listening to it.My only wish is that these tapes would be transferred to DVD.  Tapes wear out and bleed over time.  Performances as wonderful as this one need to be preserved so we can enjoy them for decades.  We need a better medium than VHS tapes.

$review_text.: One of the best thrillers I have seen in recent years. Along with "Red Eye" I think it was a sleeper that came to life because of some great story writing and better than expected acting and directing. Most of the cast wasn't that well known outside Kim Bassinger and Jason Statham. This one draws me back to it from time to time so I assure you it has great replayability. I too thought it might be a B, but when my mom and sister asked me if I had seen it I knew I should. I borrowed my moms copy and after one viewing I went out and bought a copy myself. It has a newness and familiarity about it. New storyline but it almost has a Hitchcock style to it. And believe me I say that as a complement. This is the story of a young man that only thinks of himself until a lady in distress calls him on his cell phone. He gradually becomes more and more concerned with her and her family to the point he will risk his life for them. He has to steal things in order to keep her on the line and try to find her. Don't miss it, it's an excellent thriller. Well worth owning if you like movies like "Phonebooth" and "The Transporter".P.S. As time goes by I find myself enjoying this movie even more. I actually think this is one that will be a classic thriller one day.CA Luster

$review_text.: I really liked this video


 It was my first experience with the 10 minute solutions series and I found it so easy to use that I started trying more of them
 What I like about the 10 minute videos is that it feels like you're done really quickly, even if you do 3-4 because each seem totally different due to the instructor wearing different outfits and there's a short warm up and cool down for each one

You sort of trick yourself into thinking that it was really fast so you keep on going


But if you don't, studies have shown that even 10 minutes help! One thing I've found with this particular video is that certain steps focus on only one side, so I just try doing the opposite side for a few of the reps-working the brain as well!  I like the instructor and the moves-she's positive and the moves are easy to follow


 I would not say the moves are ridiculous as a previous reviewer stated, but they are somewhat like the "light hits" on certain radio stations vs


the rock stations
:) It came with a weight belt too
 I haven't tried using it with other videos but I don't know why it couldn't be used with them as well

 All in all it is a workout I return to on a regular basis.

It's a stoic look at society, cyberspace, and what we deem to be reality. There is a great deal of religious symbolism, as well as bizarre imagery and themes. The animation style is very clean and crisp, and the series is very serious. There are no &quot;facefaults&quot; &quot;Sweatdrops&quot; or &quot;Superdeformed&quot; animation typical of many animes. It's serious anime in the same manner as Akira and Perfect Blue.

$REVIEW.: For his third film, which followed the delirious success of Pulp Fiction, writer/director Quentin Tarantino did something different.  Using Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch, Tarantino molds the author's material into his own with Jackie Brown, relying more on dialogue and story then on the kinetic energy that helped him make a name for himself with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  Revolving around the title character, played by blaxploitation survivor Pam Grier, Jackie is a flight attendant with a problem.  While transporting money for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), she is caught by the FBI, and in an effort to save herself, plays both sides to her advantage.  Among the mix are a wily Fed (Michael Keaton) looking to bring in Ordell, Ordell's doped up beach bunny girl (Bridget Fonda), his fresh from jail partner (Robert De Niro), and bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster in his Oscar nominated role) who is both attracted to, and compelled to help, Jackie in her survival.  Grier, Jackson, and Forster are perfectly cast, but perhaps the most understated performance comes from De Niro in a subtle yet complex role as a newly free criminal re-discovering the world.  Like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and his recent Kill Bill films, Tarantino's Jackie Brown isn't for everyone, but the man's talent for storytelling and dialogue and the performances from the key players help make his third film a masterpiece on par with his other modern day classics.  Much like the Special Edition of Pulp Fiction (released around the same time as this DVD), Miramax's two-disc Special Edition of Jackie Brown doesn't feature a commentary by Tarantino, but it features a horde of featurettes and an hour long retrospective interview with the man himself that is worth the price of admission alone.

$REVIEW.: The film genre I call 'scare me flicks' actually began with director George Romero's 1968 film "Night Of The Living Dead", but director John Carpenter's 1978 film "Halloween" popularized the genre
 "Halloween" also marks the starring debut of Jamie Lee Curtis


 Jamie Lee plays the innocent victim Laurie, a role she plays well.By current standards "Halloween" is a tame film, but "Halloween" contains all the 'scare me flick' elements: attractive young women victims; arrogant young men victims; a nebulous threatening presence; and unstoppable terror

 'Scare me flicks' have entertained us while redefining societal relationships -- people might laugh at Mom's threats, but nobody laughs at the unstoppable bully Michael Myers.

$review_text.: As a faithful adaptation of a Louis L'Amour novel this was a shabby effort. As one reviewer noted much of the essentials of the original story were omitted. What was left was barely recognizable. As a western story that stands on its own, apart from Louis L'Amour, this movie was below average & not very interesting. A major sub-plot was left unresolved, and minor questions left unanswered. The acting in the movie was shallow for the most part & far removed from the depth of characters developed by Louis L'Amour, even in his short stories.

$review_text.: Last King of Scotland is an interwoven fictional account of the complex relationship between Nicholas Garrigan, a young Scottish physician, and Idi Amin, the unstable Ugandan dictator.  James MacAvoy does a stand-up job as Garrigan, just out of medical school and seeking escape from the boring, genteel existence he'd face as a National Health physician in his homeland.Garrigan has a chance encounter with Amin, is seduced by the man's magnetism and the luxuries he can provide, and becomes Idi's personal physician.  The film covers the next several years as Garrigan slowly realizes the Faustian bargain he has made with an increasingly erratic and paranoid Amin, and then tries to escape Uganda.Forest Whitaker totally steals the film as Amin.  He manages to not only look the role, but to speak Amin's tribal language and give the impression that he was just a good ESL student.  He combines likeable buffoon, caring father-figure, and crackpot murderer flawlessly, maintaining a little of the former two, even as he faithfully portrays Amin's slide into homicidal despotic paranoia.Special points; On-location filming is wonderful; nice cinematography.  Soundtrack is perfect for the pathos.  Whitaker went to Uganda early to learn the language, including appropriate body language.  This is an actor totally dedicated to his craft.  The result shows and may be the finest title role in cinema so far in this new century!

$REVIEW.: The Shaw Brothers, the company known for their many releases of Hong Kong films for many decades ran by producer Sir Run Run Shaw, knighted by the British government and founder of Shaw University in Hong Kong and even founded the HK-TVB TV network was a major power behind the company and his third brother Runme Shaw (who founded South Sea Film), the film company would become known as Shaw Brothers Studio and become the first studio to bring Hong Kong cinema with sound in 1934.The Shaw Brothers have created over a thousand films and with several having been aired on US television and some being released on video, the 1971 film"The Duel" (Da jue dou) also known as "Duel of the Iron Fist" gets its US DVD release courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment and would star popular Shaw Bros. action stars David Chiang and Ti Lung and would team them up with legendary martial arts director Chang Cheh.The film would revolve around two martial arts schools (which also function as an earlier version of The Triad).  Tang Jen Chieh (played by Ti Lung) is the youngest of the brothers of his school and he is an excellent swordsman, one day he joins his school which are planing to ambush another school during a mourning period.  In order to make sure the ambush goes perfectly, the school's elder hires another excellent swordsman/martial arts weapon expert Chiang "Rambler" Nan (played by David Chiang).Jen-Chieh's school successfully slaughters everyone at their rival school but the owners were able to escape.  As Jen-Chieh's brothers and fellow students celebrate their successful ambush on their rivals, Jen-Chieh tells his fiance that the butterfly tattoo on his chest will be filled with a color to signify his love for her.  All seems to go well at the celebration party until the owners of the rival school ambush them during their celebration dinner.Needless to say, many things go wrong, more people are dead and Jen-Chieh's godfather has been killed.  Because of the deaths of the godfather and their ties with the local authorities, someone must take the wrap for the godfather's death.  Each brother are willing to sacrifice themselves and take the blame but instead, Jen Chieh decides to take the blame and cast himself off as an exile and leave his school and his fiance to honor his godfather.As Jen-Chieh has lived in exile for a year, he wonders why his brothers have not come back for him and why he has lived a harsh life.  As he goes about his normal day dreaming of his fiance and returning back home, something goes wrong as people are trying to kill him.  As he fights, defends and kills his attackers, he takes the train and tries to escape. But when he senses that people are after him on the train, he jumps off and finds himself in another predicament of people trying to kill him.  To make things worse, he knows these people as students of his school.Jen-Chieh learns the truth that one of his elder brothers was responsible for his godfather's death and now his brother wants him dead.  Jen-Chieh is confused and is now determined to go back home and find out what went wrong but also to return to his fiance and hope she is doing fine.But when he makes his long awaited return back home, what Jen-Chieh learns about his brothers, his fiance and what has happened during his one year exile will shock him.VIDEO:"The Duel" is presented in 16:9 widescreen and for the most part, Celestial Pictures has done a wonderful job thus far in their remastering of the Shaw Bros. films and "The Duel" is no exception.  "The Duel" is one of the earlier Shaw Bros. films released from FUNimation Entertainment and picture quality does show the films age just a bit.  But for the most part, for a film that is 38-years-old, this is probably the best presentation of "The Duel" that Shaw Bros. fans will see yet of the film.AUDIO:"The Duel" is presented in Mandarin and English mono.  Mandarin is the way to go for this film as the English dub is not only cheesy but the old original English dub sounds tinny and recorded badly.  In fact, you lose a lot of the crowd ambiance and the background music if you watch the English dub.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:"The Duel" comes with no special features but the FUNimation Entertainment trailers.EXTRAS:"The Duel" comes with a slip cover case.JUDGMENT CALL:"The Duel" is an action-packed, bloody fight-fes courtesy of Chang Cheh and features two awesome Shaw Bros. martial arts stars David Chiang and Ti Lung, all together for this film.This film is quite interesting because not only does it feature martial arts but it also features an earlier version of when these martial arts schools started to become more corrupted, political and eventually an earlier film showcasing the triad.  Many of the fights combine martial arts with the fighters armed with swords, knives axes and also machine guns.  In some way, despite the era of when the film takes place, "The Duel" is somewhat reminiscent of the 1985 Shaw Bros. film "Hong Kong Godfather" which revolves around the triad, revenge, martial arts and a lot of slashing and blood.But where "Hong Kong Godfather" takes place in the '80s and looks like a film from that era, "The Duel" is a martial arts film and one can expect a lot of action and even a duel between the characters played by Chiang and Lung.Interesting part about this film is its use of sound and music.  Some sounds seem to be misplaced at times but the most striking is the use of the main theme song which is literally a copy but slightly modified version of Richard Strauss's "Sprach Zarathustra" (which is used for the opening of the Stanley Kubrick 1968 film "2001: A Space Odyssey") and  hearing the song over and over makes you wonder if director Chang Cheh or composer Yung-Yu Chen was a big fan of Strauss or the film which debuted in theaters a few years earlier.I really did enjoy "The Duel" and although it is a visual bloody fight fest of a film, I did enjoy the younger brother seeking revenge and just seeing how life has changed for the worse at his school, his older brother and most of all, what happened to his fiance.  Fans of David Chiang and Ti Lung films should be happy by their action-packed performance and most of all seeing these two kick ass.There is a lot of humor and a lot of action and it's definitely one of the more violent and bloody martial arts films from the Shaw Bros.  that has been released on DVD from FUNimation Entertainment (with "Hong Kong Godfather" being the most violent).  For those expecting more martial arts, this film does include it but focuses primarily on the use of swords and knives versus hand-to-hand combat.As for the DVD, the video presentation is well done due to the remastering by Celestial Pictures but the old English dub is terrible (personally, I could never stand dubs for martial arts films and it's quality is not the best) and as mentioned earlier, Mandarin is the way to go for this film.  And like the other previous releases, there are no special features.Overall, another solid inclusion to FUNimation Entertainments Hong Kong Connection and a Shaw Bros. film on DVD worth picking up!
$SUMMARY.: An awesome yet violent, bloody, action-packed martial arts film!

This movie had about 25-30 laugh-out-loud moments in a 75% full theater.  Each of the 10 sketches has elements of bad taste (of course)  along the lines of South Park / Family Guy / Reno 9-11 / Daily Show, but in the end a laugh is a laugh is a laugh.  The cast includes some big-time heavy-hitters: the shocking Justin Theroux as Our Lord (who will 'get around to' the Apocalypse... eventually) and the hillarious Rob Cordry as a prisoner who seeks true 'love'.  ...Only for the well-read, open minded, movie-goer who is repelled by political correctness.

$review_text.: Winona Ryder is far from my favorite actress.  I can praise her work in films like Beetle Juice, Lucas  and Edward Scissorhands, but I must utterly dismiss her for lackluster performances in films like Age of Innocence and Aliens 4.  In Girl Interrupted Ryder is quite good, but the film is a mixed bag that is dominated by an almost over-the-top, though affecting performance by Angelie Jolie (as Lisa).  Her performance is the type of take no prisoners work which sometimes is richly rewarded by the Oscar folks (and of course, was).  It's also the reason to keep watching this film which offers nothing particularly new, but might connect and offer some solace to those who have ever felt alienated by not playing by someone else's idea of the rules.The film features folks in supporting roles like Whoopie Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave who aren't given much to do and therefore act like they are picking up a check for a t.v. movie of the week.I don't fault them so much for that, because much of Girl Interrupted feels very much like a t.v. movie of the week or an Afterschool Special.  It plays sometimes like a softer, gentler, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.What I really fault the film for is in it's numerous continuity errors.  I mean glaringly obvious ones that make me wonder if anyone other than Ryder cared as deeply for this project as we've been led to believe.  Supposedly (and I've no reason to disbelieve it) Ryder worked for nearly 7 years to hold onto this project and see that it was brought it to the screen with the care and reverence she felt it deserved.  To insure this, she became one of the producers of the project and probably partially financed the rights to the book and most likely sacrificed her normal star salary.The book is written as a string of vignettes, and author Susanna Kayson has a prose voice for capturing small personal details. The vignettes and thoughts add up to make a very affecting book, but the book doesn't have a strong narrative.  To make a film of the book a more conventional narrative was needed.  This narrative could have sharply skewered psychiatry, or become a feminist One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, creating some evil psychiatrist or Nurse Ratchet character.To it's credit the film doesn't do this.  It stays truer to the source material than that.  When some rich parents can't communicate with their children, they sometimes let psychiatric hospitals do their work for them.  And that's essentially the story that is told here.The hospital is not a Snake Pit kind of place.  But it is a cold, and sometimes heartless institution. The movie makes the point that one of the main reasons Kaysen was committed to McLean was her possible promiscuity, and her depression which ended with a half hearted suicide attempt involving aspirin and vodka.  Men have rarely been considered mentally disturbed for their promiscuity .The film also to its credit doesn't romanticize insanity either.  We meet characters who are troubled without thinking they are very `cool' or destined to be artistic outcasts.  Yet we don't have anyone who warrants our sympathy in terms of a central character.  After all, Kaysen admitted herself to the institution, and its clear she was smart enough to pretty quickly play the game well enough to get herself released if she decided it was better dealing with the turbulent 1960's on the outside, then the cold instutionalism of a high class mental institution. And Ryder's performances is quiet and even.  She let's Jolie as Lisa and some of the other characters over-emote around her. That's to her credit on the one hand, but it doesn't help us as audience members to care all that much about her.As the central figure of film, rather than as the narrator of the book, Kaysen is who we are most focused on.  And she is the least troubled of nearly anyone we meet.  We know she's in pretty good shape and in fact becomes a surrogate big sister to some of the other in-mates in the institution.  So where's the suspenseful conflict?  We know there isn't a really big problem, and we know she isn't in any great danger.  Some of the other characters clearly have some major issues, but we don't get to know or care very much about them.And then there are the continuity errors to really bother those who are paying attention. There are a couple of scenes where you'll see Ryder as Kaysen lighting a cigarette and smoking and then a few moments later, lighting another cigarette.  She's rarely without a cigarette but to show her constantly lighting up cigarettes is pretty ridiculous, particularly since in one case she's in the back of a cab, and if she were rapidly chain-smoking, the cab would be thick with smoke, which it isn't.Another one that really bothered me, was later in the film, (and so as not spoil anything I won't go into great details about what else is going in), we learn Angelina Jolie as the sociopath Lisa really despises cats.  A cat that  follows Ryder out for a walk, but when she returns, the cat is inside the apartment where Lisa (Jolie) is.  Lisa wouldn't have let the cat back in-she hates cats.. it's a mistake and mistakes happen but this film is full of continuity errors, which shows a real sloppiness on the director, and editors part.I couldn't help but think of times of Jack Arnold's cult campy classic Switchblade Sisters when Angeline Jolie as Lisa was on screen.  She's chewing the scenery in a barely disguised variation on a bad girl from reform school type of performaance which would have been right at home in a 50's juvie film or a 70's woman in prison film.And I couldn't help thinking that although parts of Girl Interrupted are well done, and well acted,I would have much rather been watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or even Switchblade Sisters, then this film.Chris Jarmick Author of The Glass Cocoon  with Serena F.

$review_text.: Good Luck Chuck is a simple premise.  Chuck (played by Dane Cook) is a guy who has been cursed.  I say this literally.  The movie begins in 1985 where he is at a party.  He's ten years old and he's playing "Seven Minutes in Heaven" with a bunch of friends who are, for the first time, discovering sexuality and all its glory.  They mix it up with Spin the Bottle.  Whoever the bottle lands on is who you spend seven minutes in heaven with.  Chuck's friend, Stu, goes in for seven minutes and of course the girl wants nothing to do with him.Chuck spins the bottle, hoping it'll land on his crush.  Instead it lands on the girl next to his crush who happens to be pretty Gothic and into witchcraft and all that stuff.  They go into the closet together and it turns out she really likes him but he really doesn't like her.  She's pretty quick about stripping her clothes and such because it's the first time she's "made love" (and keep in mind... she's ten!).  Chuck doesn't want to do it.  They don't know what they're doing and Chuck ends up having a pretty crap time.  The girl then places a hex on him.  Any girl who has been with Chuck will then find their next true love with the guy they date after him.This is the first folly of the film.  The simple fact that it really was a curse.  We fast forward years later and see Chuck on the beach with a girl.  The moment with said girl doesn't go so well and we discover Chuck may be a little afraid of commitment.He then goes to a wedding where the bride thanks him because were they not together, she wouldn't have found her true love.  It's at this wedding where he meets Cam, the girl he falls in love with (played by Jessica Alba).  At this point he doesn't know or believe there's some curse on him.  Of course what we know is that there is.  Then suddenly after this wedding, every woman in town wants to be with Chuck because of this "Charm."  The movie never actually goes into how the women know about this charm, or even why it's only after this wedding that they begin flocking to him.  In other words, this "Urban Legend" of Chuck has no origin.  All anyone knows is that it works.  He suddenly starts getting phone calls, more and more people show up at his office (he's a dentist).  I kept scratching my head.  The first few minutes of the movie never touches on this.  No women were curious about him or anything at the wedding.  The movie never explains how they know exactly.  His receptionists finds out online, but the movie never actually digs.  The characters don't even speculate.Then there's Stu (played by Dan Fogler) who apparently is a surgeon who works on giving women the greatest breasts.  Even a joke as simple as this was just either overplayed or downright not funny.  Dan Fogler just serves to be the perverted, piggish, "All I want is sex," dude.  Sure, lots of movies have these characters, but there's usually a humanistic side of them where you discover they're about more than sex and breasts.  Nope.  Not here.  If you're expecting a Seth Rogan like quality here (ala, Knocked Up) then you sure as hell won't get it.  This guy is about nothing but sex all the time and it was just annoying after a while.  He comes off as the most inhumane character in the movie, really.Cam ends up swinging by his office because she chips a tooth because of her stupid brother and her own little "curse" which is that her nickname (given to her by her brother) is Murphy.  After Murphy's law which states that anything that can go wrong... will.  The movie shoves this in your face by giving you screw up after screw up after screw up.  Played in rapid succession.  We never get a break from it and much like Dan Fogler's "I like breats" jokes, they're just shoved in your face.  Most of them just aren't funny.So of course Chuck is in a bind.  His friend is telling him he should love this curse.  He can have all the sex he wants because girls are just forking to him.  And for a moment he does.  Until he discovers (don't be shocked) that Cam is the one for him.  He says he doesn't believe it but man oh man can it be convincing when you discover all your ex-girlfriends found the love of their lives right after dumping you.  So he decides to test it by finding one of the most unattractive women he can find.  This woman happens to be obese, ugly and unlikeable.  She smells, burps, farts and at dinner she orders an entire turkey.  This is not only offensive, it is, like the rest of the movie, not funny.  Especially because we're supposed to believe that she believes he "wants to get physical" despite all his horrid looks.So then he has the brilliant idea of sending his friend off to date her and just like that, he discovers Stu has no interest in marrying her... and of course the big dilemma we find out there is that Stu never went out with her ever.  Chuck, of course discovers this only after having sex with Cam and the rest of the movie is played out in the fashion of him trying to keep her.Good Luck Chuck suffers from many moments not being funny.  In fact, the funniest moments in this film are in the previews and they were actually funnier in the previews.  A lot of it also comes off as immature.  The movie also put more focus on the sex than the actual situation at hand.  The characters and story are also stereotyped.  From the sex-crazed best friend to the obese woman.The gold medal of unfunny jokes here goes to Dane Cook himself who never garners a laugh.  Dane Cook gets no laughs and the best jokes in here are the jokes concerning breasts.  These are jokes that are sure to impress a sophomore in high school but little else beyond that.

$REVIEW.: Little Miss Sunshine starring Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette is the cutest and zaniest film of 2006. This film was nominated for best picture and Alan Arkin won best supporting actor, I was worried this film would be a disappointment but I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed this quirky flick from beginning to end. Abigail Breslin (also nominated) is ray of sunshine as a beauty pageant hopeful Olive Hoover, she is plain, chubby, and less than graceful but she has tremendous heart. Breslin's performance is pretty amazing for someone so young, and jeez she's been in like a thousand films after this one made her famous. Paul Dano and Steve Carell also star and probably have the best character layout in this film. I highly recommend this much-beloved gem! Enjoy!

$review_text.: You'd think a comedy starring Steve Martin, Owen Wilson, and Jack Black would be pretty funny, if not uproariously hilarious, especially when the film is centered around competitive bird watching. Based on the book by Mark Obmascik, The Big Year actually hopes to accomplish a bit more depth, but it largely falls flat. At various crossroads in their lives, Stu, Brad, and Kenny embark on a cross-country trip in hopes of spotting the most bird species in North America; along the way, they each discover enough about themselves to move on. Directed by David Frankel, The Big Year certainly cares about its characters, but I felt the film had little forward motion, and its surprising lack of humor made it feel all the more stagnant. If you're into self discovery movies, you might enjoy this; just don't expect to laugh much.

$REVIEW.: Set in Greenwich Village in 1961, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS dramatizes the life of the eponymous hero (Oscar Isaac), who tries to carve out a career as a solo folk singer after his partner commits suicide.  The film vividly recreates the atmosphere of the Gaslight Cafe, a real-life venue that opened in 1958 and closed in 1971, where acts such as Bob Dylan, Bill Cosby, and Luke Faust performed.  The Caf&eacute; attracted high-profile patrons: Jimi Hendrix was known to visit one night.  Llewyn is never going to be that popular; but we have to admire his spirit as he tries his best, despite numerous obstacles placed in his way.  The 1961 setting is significant: the Coen Brothers' film recreates a significant moment in American popular culture when people broke free of their conservative shackles and began to express themselves in much more basic terms.  Politics became a legitimate subject for popular music, rather than the anodyne lyrics characteristic of many chart-topping hits of the late Fifties.  Llewyn tries his best to emphasize the significance of his songs, but no one appears to listen to him.  The film suggests that the music business was a cut-throat world, in which talent went unrecognized and agents only promoted the tried and tested, rather than the experimental.  This is brought out in a significant exchange where Llewyn travels to Chicago, only to be rebuffed by the seedy-looking Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham).  The film is full of significant moments and quirky casting: I particularly admired the casting of Justin Timberlake as Jim, another would-be folk musician who tries to change his name to guarantee success, but ends up on the musical scrapheap, just like Llewyn.  Deliberately shot in low-key color, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS befits repeated viewings, in order to make sense of its multi-leveled structure.  Potentially a contemporary classic.

$review_text.: As far as Disney movies go, this is my childhood movie. I was very excited when I saw this movie was being re-released on Bluray. The Bluray picture and sound is excellent, and the movie is just as enjoyable as I remember. My three year-old truly enjoys the music from this disc and the karaoke has been loads of fun.

$review_text.: Heavy emphasis on his Echo material and there were some glaring omissions from his hits

 I also would have preferred a rocking (rather than acoustic) version of "Even The Losers"

 Still they rocked hard and played a good variety from each period of his career


 Howie Epstein died in 2003 (2-3 years after this gig) but he looked frail and drawn even in this performance.



$SUMMARY.: Good show, band rocked but...

$review_text.: The u2 DVD &quot;Live in Boston&quot; concert is incredible. I knew, ofcourse, the group was going to put on an amazing show as they always do.  But the thing that impressed me about this DVD the most was how well it was made.  I think the production and directing of it was amazing, they seemed to have just enough close-ups, just enough shots of the crowd going wild, just enough shots of the heart-shaped stage and the great lighting that lit it up.  It was so well done it seems as if you were at the concert, and the emotion that u2 brings to their fans at their shows you can feel in your TV room.I think this is a must-have for all u2 fans, I say pay the money just to watch &quot;Where the Streets have No Name,&quot; that performance itself is worth the 20 and change.  The DVD comes with some good special features as well which you should definetly check out.Now, my one negative comment about the DVD, which is why I rate it a 4 star instead of 5.  The track listing.  Although the concert was incredible and they gave me some good surprises on the DVD (i.e. &quot;Wake up Dead Man&quot; and &quot;The Fly&quot;), where is &quot;New Years Day&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways?&quot; I believe they played the latter at the Boston concert and they cut it out of the DVD.  Why? I went to the D.C. and Baltimore shows this summer and I thought &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; was one of the best songs they did all night (especially with what they did with the lighting and backscreen).  And they didn't put my all-time favorite &quot;ONE&quot; on the DVD, which I think is a mistake.Despite that, the songs that are on this DVD are great and every u2 fan should get their hands on this DVD.  It is something you can watch over and over again.  Everything about it says masterpiece.  The words, the songs, the crowd, the stage, the group.  Everything about it says U2.
