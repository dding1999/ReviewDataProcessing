$REVIEW.: (Disclaimer: I received a free advance reading copy of this to review, but I honestly don't think this has influenced the content of the review.)This is really good
 :)  It's a mix of new and old science fiction short stories, all more or less hard SF, all more or less involving someone who is more or less a space pilot, although exactly what is being piloted, and into exactly what sort of space, varies delightfully.As a long-time reader of SF and classic SF, my eye immediately caught the Budrys and Dick, and I thought "whoa, those two are going to stand out embarrassingly from some random modern stories by young whippersnappers"

 But I was wrong!  The classic stories are very good, but so are the modern ones


 Good diction, good writing, good ideas, things that surprised me and made me think new things.The stories are short, which I also like

 Many, even most, of them might be the first chapter in a novel; they paint pictures beyond themselves
 If a few are a little too pat, a little too "sudden happy ending in a really complex situation", I was still left with the feeling that in the next chapter the complexities of the situation are going to return, and the apparently happy ending is going to spiral into other and less pat events; so even the endings that seemed "happily ever after" on the surface led me into deeper thoughts.If you like science fiction short stories and/or hard SF and/or tales of interstellar voyaging, I recommend this collection highly.

$review_text.: I love cookbooks with commentary (e.g
America's test kitchen, Cooks Illustrated) and enjoyed reading this cookbook


 I think if you liked "Dinner: a love story" you would like "Keepers" as well


 There is some practical advice for home cooks interspersed with the recipes.Of the dinners I have tried we have particularly enjoyed "Japanese style meat and potatoes" and a gratin dish with white beans and sausage
 I have tried recipes with similar ingredient profile but their version was a winner


 I tried this book from the library then purchased the kindle version from amazon.

I read this book over a month ago and I'm still thinking of it

Twitch was a character that definitely has some issues and deals with them in an unconventional way but you can't help but love him for it
Lexi was a great character also

Overall this was a different kind of love story if you could really even call it that
I would recommend this to anyone who loves a flawed hero

And let me tell you Twitch is definitely flawed.

$review_text.: From the start, Blood of the Wicked had me hooked. A punchy opening isfollowed by intriguing events with engaging characters at the center of theconflict between landowners and landless workers, who are little more thanslaves.Leighton Gage weaves an intricate plot and occasionally steps back in time toflesh out the main character, Mario Silva. While at first these lengthyexcursions distracted from the main story, with their own dramatic eventsunfolding, I soon realized they provided necessary background information forwhat's to come. And what a great twist the ending provided. While unexpected,it made perfect sense under the circumstances. In many ways Father Angeloreminded me of Lisa Kerry inStrays of Rio. Althoughthese two characters are quite different, they come to the sameconclusion. In a society where income and wealth are distributed so unevenly,it's no wonder corruption still prevails and justice is hard to achievelegally for those without the necessary connections and funds.

$review_text.: Truth's Evil Light is the first Urban Fantasy book I've ever read, and one of the few books I've read in the fantasy genre. I received a free copy of this book so that I could write a review and I'm very glad I did. Since it is the first I've read in this genre, I don't have very much to compare it with, however, I found the book very entertaining and interesting. The main character, Cheveyo, is a bit sarcastic, which I did find rather tiresome after a while, however this did not interfere with the story. The story is heavily plot-driven, which I imagine is probably the case with most fantasy genre books. There is an underlying romantic subplot that I found compelling as well.The plot is pretty complicated. One problem that I had was remember who was who, and how they fit into the imaginary world. There is a glossary at the beginning with a list of who's who but it's difficult to go back and forth all the way to the beginning and there was no way to click directly on that glossary.I found the imaginary world (Tweentown) quite intriguing. It really got my imagination going. I don't want to spoil the plot and say too much about what happens in this imaginary world as I really feel this is one of the most important elements to the story, and perhaps this is the case with all or most books in the fantasy/urban fantasy genre.There was only one complaint I had, and this was more an element perhaps of my own personal taste in writing style, and again may be quite common in this genre, but that was the tendency of the writer (Michaela McGregor) to begin sentences with prepositional phrases. I started to notice it after a while and found if distracting. The minute I would start to get caught up in the story I would notice this pattern, which became predictable and got on my nerves. If it weren't for this one glitch that, as I said, may be a matter of personal taste, I would have given this book five stars. I would still, however, have had to work very hard to figure out what was going on in the story. It is complicated, interesting, definitely great escape material. It is written well, even if it isn't written in a style that I like. It is extremely well edited. There were no grammatical issues or spelling or typographical issues whatsoever. The story hung together perfectly, with surprise twists and turns to keep you guessing. Sometimes I did feel that something happened that I missed, and had the feeling that I needed to go back and reread in order to keep up with the story but that is difficult with a kindle version, which was the version that I read.One last thing. I found several very memorable quotes that made me stop and think. Some of the magical, supernatural realities of this world that McGregor created also made me stop and think. I felt it really freed up my imagination to go on creative journeys, right along with Cheveyo and her adventures.Overall, this is an entertaining, action-packed, heavily plot-driven, escapist type of story that I would recommend to people who enjoy this genre.
$SUMMARY.: Imaginative and Adventurous

$REVIEW.: Dangerous Minds starts with the take down of terrorists. Our hero, Cyrus Cooper, then takes an undercover position working for a brilliant scientist. I would even call her a mad scientist. She does research in Neuroscience studying ESP type behaviors and brain function. Attempts are made on her life and Cyrus saves the day. However, the scientist isn&#8217;t all she seems. Cyrus is young in age but old in mind.This is a very enjoyable book, an entertaining read. Our hero has morals, wit, smarts, and doesn&#8217;t blindly follow orders. Yeah! He thinks for himself and comes to satisfying conclusions. This book has a cliff hanger ending which ensures that I will be reading future books in the series. This book would be a great read for those who like science minded thrillers, military/spy thrillers, and great characters. I highly recommend this books for those who like Rollins and other writers if his ilk.

However, navigation isn't intuitive

There is a menu with  links so you can go to the beginning of a section, but you can't easily get back to where you left off -- you'd have to go back to the beginning of that book or section.One could use bookmarks to navigate, but that kind of defeats the purpose


It doesn't really work any better on my tablet.If you only have an ereader, this might be good for you if you want to read through it all sequentially, but if you have a tablet or a smart phone, I'd suggest getting the LDS Scriptures App for just a few dollars more.Overall, I was very disappointed.

$REVIEW.: No Remorse picks up right where Red Flag left off, exploring the idea of two ordinary people trying to manage their relationship in a war zone
A wedding is once more the catalyst for Alex and Gloria to travel to Chinese occupied Taipei, where there is a tenuous peace since the occupation


However, this time round, the wedding is their own
Yikes! Didn&#8217;t they learn last time? Without filling this review with spoilers, No Remorse is a much darker outing than Red Flag, and Alex and Gloria come much closer to the conflict than before.Greene also elevates the intensity of the plot in No Remorse, and in particular, the shocking war scenes that were introduced in Red Flag

There&#8217;s a lot of the appeal in the way Greene describes battle and war scenes
They&#8217;re never pretty, heroic or glorious
They&#8217;re nasty, grim and horrifying


Innocent people die in unpleasant ways, as surely they must do in real wars.Again, the story shifts between characters on all sides of the conflict, as well as those that are caught in the middle - the collateral damage
No Remorse has the same documentary feel as Red Flag, with multiple viewpoints, that are not necessarily directly connected other than painting a broad picture of the situation

As a pleasant shift of perspective, we get to hear Gloria&#8217;s side of the story in No Remorse, where we had only heard from Alex in the first book.This episode has a lot more substance than the first book too, and explores the themes started in Red Flag in more detail
If it wasn&#8217;t fiction, you&#8217;d be tempted to get hold of Alex and Gloria and tell them to move to a quieter part of the world.

$review_text.: This review might be a little short because I'm tired and now heading to bed. With that out of the way let me commend Mr. Blue for a terrific follow up to part 1. This writer isn't a legend in the urban literary game for nothing. he knows how to draw you in, he knows how to make something which may be taboo turn out to be the truest form of love out there. He knows how to change a characters mind not with harsh words and threats but with tears, raw emotion, shameless truth and love.I really enjoyed part 2 because we delved deeper into the lives of these teenage girls, we were expecting something much different but what we got was a character driven story which really set things up nicely in part 3. the characters in this story are well developed and they see the world through eyes which shouldn't see such things, felt things bodies are not to feel at a young age. This was a self examination of just how harsh the ghetto can b and how unforgiving it is on both sides.Hats off to you again brother, keep on doing you and again wishing you all the very best and for those who are saying it's too short. It's only 99 cents and it's called a SHORT STORY (jeez)

I really liked that move, since most books start out really slow, not that I mind, but I like to get to the action. We also see some very important characters & they author is great at making each one unique!This book was a fun & fast read, with characters that were like-able, I mean, we all at some point feel as though we have been left in an unknown world to fend for ourselves, hello high school?

$REVIEW.: I am seeing more and more books just written with a simple plot and with little to hold my interest. Kind of like the romance books where you spend the money to find female meets male. They like then hate each other or hate then like each other. They have a falling out and each loses weight looks like hell then they determine they cannot live without the other and find some way to meet up make up then happy ever after. Same plot different names with a few extra characters in it to make you think there might be a plot but then you figure out same thing different names, different town..... and you spend money for what? At least now with free ebooks not money but time spent finding same old same.

$review_text.: The author excoriates Daniel Dennett and Carl Sagan by name, and by implication all of the New Atheists. My criticism of Richard Dawkins, to name another, is that he has blind spots about religion and is dishonest in addition to being irrational and ignorant. I give Dawkins a character quotient of zero. Jean-Paul Sartre, on the other hand, gets a character quotient of 100 because of the following quote:"Thus the passion of man is the reverse of that of Christ, for man loses himself as man in order that God may be born. But the idea of God is contradictory and we lose ourselves in vain. Man is a useless passion." (Jean-Paul Sartre,Being and Nothingness: The Complete Text (Fourth Printing), New York: Washington Square Press, p. 784)Sartre and Schaeffer have similar concepts of God. The "contradictory" nature of God is perfectly consistent with Thomas Aquinas's understanding that God is pure act of existence and humans have an existence that is limited by an essence. The paradox, contradiction, or mystery about God is the question of what would motivate an infinite being to create finite beings.God has revealed to mankind through the prophetic religions of the Near East, the mystical religions of India, and the Wisdom religions of China that there is life after death.  We are not guaranteed salvation, but can hope for it with "fear and trembling." We have to decide whether this is true, not whether or not God exists. If our freedom is before God and if our past is somehow gathered up when we die, Frank Schaeffer does not believe this because God does not want him to believe. Faith is both a decision and a gift from God. Schaeffer has no grounds for thinking that his metaphysical insights are what prevent him from believing that his beloved mother is in heaven.Sartre and Schaeffer both realize that the Resurrection of Jesus was an historical event that can't be understood in terms of any other historical event. He says, "the Enlightenment was a Christian heresy." (location 1355) Schaeffer calls himself a Christian because Jesus taught that human beings should be compassionate.  Schaeffer does not see the Enlightenment as a rejection of Jesus, but rather an improvement of Jesus' message. Needless to say, he does not think that the Enlightenment caused the genocide and wars of the 19th and 20th century.Sartre admits that life without God has no meaning, but Schaeffer thinks it does and tries to prove it by telling about his loving parents, successful careers, and happy marriage.  His only rational argument against religious faith is the insight that if God cared about our welfare, He would not cause so much suffering in the world. I'm giving Schaeffer a character quotient of 50.

$REVIEW.: Why did I wait so long to read this?! I absolutely loved this book. It has adventure (quests), dragons, knights, humor, good principles, friendship and self-discovery.Andy Smithson is a kid that has kind of gotten lazy. He doesn't feel heard or seen by his parents and he just lets things happen to him because no one is going to listen to him anyway. But one day he is "beamed" to a different place where dragons and Pegasus' exist. Andy is welcomed warmly and sincerely, which is new to him. He is also gets the opportunity to earn trust and respect, even from adults.I enjoyed reading about Andy's adventures. The Prologue was funny as well. The characters seem genuine and easy to relate to. The setting takes some getting to use to because it was hard for me to imagine the landscape and how people functioned under the "curse." But the author keeps it well in our minds. The pacing and end-of-chapter cliffhangers kept me reading.There are many good principles brought up in the book. Although they were quite obvious to me (an adult) they may be a good "nudge in the right direction" for the middle graders who are the target reading group.I would definitely recommend this book to middle graders, boys and girls, especially if you like magic, dragons, knights, and quests (sorry no princesses). This is only the beginning for Andy. Will he be able to break the curse? I can't wait to read the next adventure.Rating 5/5 starsMore reviews at [...]

$review_text.: Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest reviewSeriously these books are playing games with my heart!If you haven't read Untamed, STOP NOW AND GO ONE CLICK! Then come back and one click out of control cause you are going to be hooked. This series is like my own personal drug and I don't think I will ever get a proper fix, just a high when reading only to come crashing down when I realize I've reached the end. There are no words to explain how much I am sucked into this story and how much I yearn for more.Reagan has tried to move on and escape the clutches of her controlling family. Their needs are always put before hers and she has had enough. She needed to get away and prove to them she could make it on her own. Where better to pursue her passion for art then in Paris? But it also led her to her other passion, Dare.Hot Damn Dare!! He is still sexy as hell but his demeanor throughout this book had me clutching my own chest in pain. My stomach knotted on numerous occasions and I couldn't help but also cry from the constant rejection of his feelings towards Reagan. I get it. I mean the love of your life denies her knowledge of you when you wanted to be there for her, but she did it for you! Dare and Reagan both have issues that will make you want to reach into the book and slap the crap out of them. At the same time you sympathize and understand, it&#8217;s such a cluster****!Reagan's character has made great strides from the once pill popping, party, and one night stand kind of gal. I can't help but feel proud of Reagan's actions to try to disconnect from her family which are absolutely poison. I loathe them so much and let me tell you, if you thought they had stooped low in the last book just you effing wait. UGH.It still amazes me that these authors can produce so much content, drama, and emotion in so few pages but to be able to do that takes talent. I cannot wait for the next book as my heart is literally hanging on by thread.Beyond 5 *wink* read!!!!!Book Flirts by Jessi

$review_text.: 4 Art House, Sculpted, Living Breathing Real Stars * * * *This was unexpected... I had no clue as to whether this was for me or not. I had read the blurb... had an idea of a romantic situation... artsy/ fartsy set up... with wine mogul and art student... so I was set and ready to read...But oh wait... this is different... the voice of the character... and she is describing how she knows she was never that model type and it was ok.... here she was at 22, a NYU Fine Arts grad student; comfortable in her own skin, knew her art was good and would be fine pursuing that in the purest sense....Wait no whining, no woe is me... Oh...I am really on board for this now. .So as I continue to read this, the voice is fresh and I am connecting even though I may not be the target audience...but then again... what is that exactly when we read romance... but I digressThe voice is Jules and she has this way of communicating which can sometimes feel like she is tongue tied... then she has moments of pure brilliance mixed with references that come from life's moments we all share; whatever media darling who has gotten their sound bite or a referral to a TV show which was the rage... but here's the thing... for me, it wasn't cheesy or too cute... it just was... it was her life experience, her reference points and they worked.In the Florence museum where her love, David (the Statue), resides, she meets Mr. Beautiful; he is enough to be muse worthy... she literally bumps into him. He is tall, dark, and handsome; has these aquamarine eyes which look at her as though they see everything... he helps her up, touching her innocently enough yet branding her skin... short circuiting her brain.... making speech difficult... thinking even harder but knowing this....She will never be the same and neither will he... we learn later.Jules is back from Florence, doing her classes and part time job at a local coffee house. She has a perfect roommate in Ian...her once college crush that didn't play for her team morphed into a brother from another mother. He is a photographer, art model and biggest fan of Jules' talent. They are presented perfectly... connection, love and support between them is there.Jules' talent is extraordinary; she has the ability to capture, feel, then put pencil to paper and create this living breathing work of art. The description of how she sees things and how the world just drops away while she is creating puts you right there. You get that sense of timelessness... of the sun moving across the sky and suddenly it is dark and she doesn't know why. I totally bought into this woman and loved her for all of these parts.Mr. Beautiful comes into the picture in New York... he orders a 4 shot espresso Iced Americano and the machine promptly blows up causing Jules and him to become drenched. A Pattern develops... Jules klutzy due to circumstances beyond her control and difficulty speaking around him. She does find out who he is though and by the end of this event... she has taken said drenched jacket for dry cleaning and is determined to make amends.As the story progresses, it turns out Ian's big photographic break of shooting a major series for a first rate magazine is of Mr. Beautiful, Leo Carducci of Carducci Wines- Sienna, Italy and New York. He is in the trades, flashed on the net, heir to this Wine dynasty and is moving to a position of taking it over and getting their name out there.Ian, being Ian... takes a drawing Jules did of her remembrance of Leo's body she saw when he was drenched... all of the six pack was visible through the clinging soft cotton fabric... so the sketch revealed Jules' talented vision and depth... the texture of the wet cloth... the ripples of the defined muscles... it was all there and Leo wanted that vision to be used to create a new label for the wine... with the use of the bust of the founder Renaldo Carducci, his great, great, so many greats grandfather. He offers Julie a lifetime experience to go to Florence, be on the vineyard do the label art as an employee and fulfill her requirements for her graduate program. The tale takes off from there...This was one of the sweetest yet not cloying reads I have read in awhile. This is not the typical blah blah ... they have chemistry... they get all hot and bothered... then there is conflict... pout and then fixed ... ta da happy ever after story...This was special... the way we are in each of their heads... the way Julie is who she is... how she expresses herself and feels things... her passion for art and ability to see objects and things is conveyed to the reader so well ... it just takes you there...And then the love .... It is all over the page... love for the land and wine... love for each other ... love for being the people you need to be in life and the best... learning to risk everything... to love and if it breaks your heart... than at least you did love...I am now a fan of this writer... she did very unique (for me) set ups, plot points and gave me a wonderful experience. If given the chance... I think she will do that for you too....A gifted copy was provided by author/publisher for an honest review."

$REVIEW.: I loved this book. Let me say that again I loved this book. I loved the idea that Cassie who doesn't believe in witchcraft is the most powerful one of all. I love how her dad through all his faults shows his love and tries to protect Cassie. The book sucks you in from the moment you begin until the last page and leaves you wanting more.Cassie is a non believer who has the best friend who is perfect. Or so everyone thinks. Cassie with her fiery hair that goes with her personality is smart and kind but a firecracker as well. She is talented in spells for a non believer. Her sister's death has effected her more than anyone could imagine and when she uncovers that her sister's death isn't all that it seems, the mystery and unraveling of truths begin.Ethan is enigmatic and kind but is not really trusted by everyone. He has secrets but it seems Cassie has taught him to forgive and love. Ethan does some boneheaded things and should be trusted more but Cassie's reason for not being so trusting is understandable. In the end though you will love him but not being wanting to spit on him and curse him.Kay, Cassie's best friend is a wannabe. A follower of sorts who tries to escape her homelife through alcohol. She is the Jr Coven leader and is a fanatic. Her love of the Coven overrules her love and loyalty to Cassie and that is sad because Cassie will do anything for Kay.Jeff a hero in his own right. He seems like he isn't and is against Cassie but in the end we see a strong man who loved Cassie and would go to the ends of the earth to protect her.Cassie's mom though is a piece of work. She is fanatical and selfish. I feel for Cassie and her dad at the end. She betrayed her love for Cassie and her dad. I don't know what will happen to her but she deserves whatever punishment she can get.The story is fascinating. A tale of a town that is a coven. A sister who dies but the death isn't all it seems to be and leads down to a path of evil and betrayal. A father who is layered in guilt and resolve in keeping his daughter safe. A curse that causes fanaticism and terrible use of gifts. An evil that is bound to bring about some tough times. A attraction that changes and transforms someone. This love allows someone to get peace and be freed. Sacrifices that show love and devotion. A mystery that will keep you reading on and the heroine who you can't not love.

But after lamenting recently about another of these 'Cravings' being too short to really establish a HEA, I went too look at the submission criteria for this line and this is story is exactly what it was supposed to be: a paranormal erotic romance quickie. So now I know and while I did like the set up (and the idea of a demon firefighter really grabbed me) I have decided that these Craving imprints work best for me when they are shorts connected to one of the author's longer books.

$REVIEW.: Considering that I am new to this game, I was confused at just what "winning" strategy book by top player author I should buy. I am glad that I picked this one! The book doesnt waste time teaching the history of the game or basic how to play, rather it jumps right in to the theory that you need to win. Vol one teaches tight agressive play, while volume 2 teaches loose agressive play. I will be buying that one shortly as well. So far I have won $500 in one months time using the techniques in this book, which is pretty good considering that I am a newbie and am playing low stakes poker cash games.

$REVIEW.: This was a solid start to what looks to be a very interesting new mystery series. I really liked it and I'm a cat Epson. Period! The description caught my attention, and so did many of the other readers reviews so I said "what the heck" and went for it. I'm quite glad I did. If your curious just utilize the "look inside" feature as I did and you'll be captivated.Caro is a divorced and runs a pet therapy service and one day after she has broken into her cousins house she supplies therapy for a client. A client who is mysteriously found dead several hours later. So, now she is naturally under suspicion.I did find it odd to 'hear' a Texas drawl coming out of the mouth of a Californian but it really works. From Caro's past with the beauty queen circuit, to her breaking and entering her cousins, her love of animals...everything just works in this novel. I can't wait for the next one to see how the other half of this writing team is going to handle things.Well fleshed and totally believable characters, excellent narrative, witty and sassy dialogue, all come together to make this a fun fast read for a lazy day.

$REVIEW.: I liked the premise of Rhiannon being flung 101 years into the future into a dystopian world Saare manages to describe as a bleak, post-Apocalyptic type "I AM LEGEND" scenario, with monsters stalking an exhausted human race


Rhiannon talked a demon into allowing a curse place on Disco to be transferred to her, and in typical demon fashion, strings were attached, hence her transportation into a world where werewolves and vampires fought each other and humans were raised as cattle to feed the blood-suckers.The werewolves were a paramilitary pack led by Carter, who decided to make Rhiannon his mate until the remnants of Disco's present day vampire family rescue her
Her grief knows no bounds when she discovers her lover, Disco, died shortly after she disappeared in the past, sacrificing himself for her
Rhiannon makes a new pact with the demon, Zagan, and goes back to the present and saves Disco

But, she interferred with the natural course of events by saving Disco and now, with the future outcome changed, events have been set in motion that will alter the entire course of their future.SPOILERS


I think I see where this is going
By saving Disco, Rhiannon might be heralding the terrible future she was transported into as a certainty

Then, there is her relationship with Disco himself
When she came back from the future and he discovered she'd been "unfaithful" to him, he tortured her mind, knowing the agony it was causing her, but still treating her like a possession that he was entitled to subjugate; to make subservient to his will and to hurt as his desire dictated

After everything Rhiannon went through in her life, with another rapist, she doesn't need a psychic rapist on top of it all
It was inexcusable

Period
She's much better off with the gentle, caring Paine who has loved her from a distance and stayed faithful to her memory for over a century


She's a fool if she goes back to an abusive, tormenting jerk like Disco

He blew it


And Rhiannon is too strong a character to be sucked into the role of an abused girlfriend that takes her abuser back knowing what he's capable of doing to her.

$REVIEW.: If I hadn't read multiple series from Amber Kell & read this series first I would have thought nothing nice of her work &never thought twice if never reading anything by her again. I found this book terrible. Jumpy, hard to follow, terrible story telling & just not for me at all. Her other series are 5+ stars and can't put them down this I skipped the ending all together because I truly didn't care to finish the book.

$REVIEW.: It was a bit of a love hate relationship with this book&#8230; and I tend to have that towards this genre which is why I don&#8217;t read them often but I do like it when I find a well told one&#8230; which this was&#8230; it is a dark and twisted tale&#8230; and though it was a bit graphic it didn&#8217;t rely on gore to scare you&#8230; it was very much a psychological thriller as you have that feeling that someone is coming for you&#8230; I liked how it was mixed in with the everyday things&#8230; Daniel would be out shopping for baby stuff and find out another body was found&#8230; be at the bar to learn another had dropped&#8230; it could&#8217;ve been anyone anywhere and that&#8217;s what made it so terrifying&#8230; the normal vibe that surrounded it&#8230; and each time you think you know who the killer is or why it&#8217;s happening Freeman throws a monkey wrench in the mix and you&#8217;re left wondering who will be taken out next&#8230; and the ending was a huge surprise&#8230; like the sort you just never expect to really happen&#8230;But my problem with this book&#8230; other than the fact Freeman kept using &#8216;piece&#8217; instead of &#8216;peace&#8217;&#8230; was how unlikeable the characters were&#8230; in the beginning you know some just weren&#8217;t meant to be liked&#8230; but as you get further in there&#8217;s pretty much no one left to like&#8230; as they become wrapped up in this you can understand they may not be at their best but you&#8217;d think like Daniel and Tom would make some smarter choices&#8230; but the as you really get into the story, Daniel goes from being this likeable man that you fear for to being rather arrogant and snide&#8230; and even though there were lots of times that I was wondering if he was the one behind it all&#8230; after all he does have blackouts where he doesn&#8217;t know how he came to be where he was&#8230; and yes it may sounds strange to want a potential murderer to me more likable&#8230; but the further in it got the less I felt for him&#8230; and that bothered me&#8230; but ultimately the book was pretty great&#8230; it didn&#8217;t get dragged out and there was plenty of excitement&#8230; definitely one worth reading&#8230;

$REVIEW.: Beauty and the Beast, adaptation by Marie Le Prince de BeaumontIn The Company, K


J

Parker writes (summarized), "If you expect the prince, you will end up disappointed when you end up with just a man
But if you expect the monster, you will be ecstatic when you end up with just a man" (for the full quote, see my review)
That is pretty much the premise of this short story.Beauty is the daughter of a well-to-do merchant


She has three brothers (who aren't really in the story) and two older sisters, both of whom are pretty repugnant; they only care about their own social status

Beauty is the only one who is worthwhile in the group; she doesn't care about wealth
When her father's business fails, she laments the books, but that's it; she enjoys living out in the country with her family.One night her father is out on business and, returning late, is caught by darkness and the howls of wolves

He fears for his life until he spots a castle
All of his needs are seen to in the castle, but he can't figure out who is doing it
Upon leaving, he remembers that Beauty asked him to bring her back a rose


But when he goes to cut one, a terrible beast appears and threatens to kill him unless he has a daughter to offer in his place


Beauty volunteers, and that is how she comes to live in the castle.The story pretty much follows the movie adaptation of it, except that there is no male hunter, nor is there a time constraint (i.e
the petals falling off the rose)


Instead, when she leaves to visit her father, he decides to starve himself to death


When she realized how sad she would be if he were to die, she realized how much she loved him, and agreed to marry him.The evil sisters become animated statues that will remain stone until they overcome their vices--serves them right!Memorable Quote:"I have no sense; I know very well that I am a poor, silly, stupid creature.""Tis no sign of folly to think so, (replied Beauty,) for never did a fool know this."For more reviews like this, check out my profile!

I am looking forward to seeing what my family thinks of the Zesty New York Cheesecake. This book clearly explains how to cook and prepare each dish in a way that easy to understand even if you are not much of a chef like me. It also includes a picture for each recipe which I have always found helps me when cooking.I highly recommend this book to anyone that does not have enough cheesecake in their life.

$review_text.: This book is about a math geek who loves hockey and lands the dream job working for the NHL, Sarah Jenkins, and a fun loving easy going hockey player for the Buffalo Storm, Sebastian St. Amant. Sebastian falls instantly for Sarah but she is unable to trust men because of what happened to her in her past. I had a love/hate relationship with Sarah on one hand she is super sweet and amazingly tough but on the other hand it drove me nuts how much she was denying her feelings for Sebastian, because I madly fell in love with Sebastian he's young, handsome, speaks French and plays hockey what more could you ask for. I found myself getting frustrated with Sarah when he did and wanting so badly for things to work out for them. Then when Sebastian goes through that whole ordeal and ended up changing and not for the better I was so sad I wanted to just give him the biggest hug and help him through it, but in the end Sarah came back strong and was able to rectify a wrong and save a wonderful thing between them that had me squealing with joy. I loved this book and can't wait to read more from this team, like maybe reading about Rob or Ricky and seeing if they get the happy endings they deserve. This will most definitely not be the last thing I read by Cassandra Carr she is an amazing author with amazing stories to tell and I'm eager to hear more. A definite must read!

$REVIEW.: ***THIS BOOK WAS GIVEN TO ME IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW***This story was great. The characters were a good but a little flawed. There were some characters that came along that I thought would be part of the main story but they just fell off the face of the earth, gone, no explanation, nothing. That made me a little sad.I like that the author kept me on my toes. I wasn&#8217;t really sure what would happen next. Most books nowadays you can kinda of see where the author is heading, but not with this book. I love twists and turns, it keeps me guessing.Without giving too much away I loved HOW the fog was implemented. The author was a genius for that one.All in all it was an awesome read. I can&#8217;t wait for the second one to come out.***Review has been done in conjunction with Nerd Girl Official. For more information regarding our reviews please visit our Fan Site: [...]**

$review_text.: Horrible!  No reasoning for the attraction.  The young character does nothing in his actions to make you feel like he is a man and not a boy.  This makes the older character look very bad.  There is nothing to bring your mind out of thinking this is a tatally inappropriate relationship, not based on the younger man's age so much as he is young, acts young and is put under the older mans care.Do i think a story with a relationship between an older man and an 18 year old is ok?  Yes, if it is told right.  Not here.  There is just no character development at all.

 The plot and climax of this novel was worthy of the time invested in reading it

The wrap up at the story's end  answered all questions and any suspicions were clarified leaving you without unfilled cliff hangers


The grammar, editing, character and plot development were excellently done
Each page held a new twist that  baited the reader to do nothing else but to keep reading.A summer must-read and I think Jana DeLeon has some competition here with her 'Mudbug' series
This was the first book I've read by this author and I would definitely be reading any further books written by her..

$REVIEW.: This book can change your life! Really. I read a lot of health and fitnees books - especially lately due to being older and having health problems of my own. This is totally the best book I have read on the topic. Ever. It is simple and comprehensive, well-researched and it makes sense, is doable and explains lifestyle changes that can help you to be more healthy. The back of the book inludes a 30 day challenge of lifestyle adjustments to do each day. In addition, there is a website on which you can answer questions and get daily reminders sent to you for 30 days. Most of what is in the book about eating, I already knew most of what the book tells about food, but don't always eat correctly anyway like most of us, but I found the reasons to eat right in this book encouraging and it has good tips like putting healthy snack foods at eye level. I learned a lot about movement that I was not aware of including the fact that we retain more that we learn if we move immediately afterwards - and I am totally moving a lot more now than I was before reading this including walking daily and incorporating more movement into my daily routines. Lastly, I learned a lot about sleep that I was not aware of including reducing light levels in the hour or so before bedtime and the importance of a good night's sleep on our overall health. Each chapter of the book ends with a list of three bullet points that sum up the main ideas about eating, moving and sleeping in that chapter. I signed up on the website for the daily reminder e-mails and am using this book as a reference book for lifestyle changes that I am sure will help me to be healthier. I recieved this book free to review from Netgalley and I am so glad that I did! It is a fantastic book and I highly recommed it!

$REVIEW.: I am a fan of Nancy Wilson and her husband Doug
 I've read _Reforming Marriage_ and _The Fruit of Her Hands_ and was challenged by both of them
 They were filled with Scriptural principles and biblical models for the roles of men and women in marriage.My issue with this particular book is that it is filled with &quot;shoulds&quot;
 You should do this..
you shouldn't allow your children to do this..


a loving parent will do this..
parents who allow their children to throw temper tantrums in the grocery store hate their children
 My problem with extrabiblical &quot;shoulds&quot; is that it leads to a form of legalism


 Now, Mrs


Wilson is NOT suggesting that you &quot;should&quot; do all these &quot;shoulds&quot; to attain righteousness
 However, there is a sense that if you don't do these things, you are a bad parent and not living out God's design for the family.I don't agree with the first reviewer that, by following Mrs

Wilson's suggestions that you become a slave to your husband

 Not at all!  I just see that, with all these rules for being a good parent, there is no room for making mistakes

 If you don't do this, your kids are going to turn out crappy


 Sheesh!  I get exhausted just reading it let alone thinking about how I'm going to implement all this stuff.I believe the suggestions are good ones, thus the three star review

 I agree with just about all of them


 However, there is more than one way to go


 Heaping a bunch of law on my head doesn't help.

But for what he does present on effectively communicating, it is very helpful.One suggestion though - skip the first part and just start on part 2. They try to communicate the principles in the second part in a fictional parable, and it just doesn't work for me. I have a hard time buying stories that were made up simply to illustrate points - they always feel fake and forced.

$REVIEW.: I've been out of sales for 3+ years and have been doing training since. In that time I've read mostly marketing, self-improvement, and general business books, but no new sales books. With this one being the #1 sales book now I decided to give it a read.In a world where 99% of all sales training books stick with the old-school, time-worn nonsense that doesn't work anymore, The Little Red Book of Selling is a breath of fresh air! Jeffrey Gitomer is no-holds-barred in his very realistic, and very very useful and applicable advice. If you're in sales, you're crazy not to read this book. On top of that, he's very entertaining and fun to read, so instead of forcing yourself to finish like with most business books, you won't be able to put this one down!You'll love how you can begin using the information you'll learn immediately. The book departs from the idiotic "multiply by this and that and the other thing to determine how many cold calls and proposals you need to make quota." In fact Jeffrey adamantly states that quotas are crap and cold calls are a waste of time. He replaces that old-line thinking with very practical and real-world advice that will begin working for you, today. Don't miss out!

$REVIEW.: This is absolutely a five star book, but where to start describing it is a difficult decision
It isn't action packed

There aren't any real fight scenes and very little gets blown up

There isn't any passionate romance (though there is love) and there's not even a whiff of sex

But the whole book is chocked full of delicious irony
Plus, it has Karen Hanover and Karen Hanover is now my official favourite character of all time

She is marvellous--quick witted, sarcastic, determined, persistent and willing to fight the good fight for the man she loves (even if he doesn't know her anymore).The whole world is, literally, going mad...at least from the perspective of the CDC and other governing bodies

The book does an amazing job of highlighting the dehumanising (and often illogical) effects of bureaucratic thinking and red tape, until even the most mentally stable people are so enraged that they end up being treated as insane for not playing their culturally-scripted well-behaved roles well enough


Until the people in charge have wound themselves so tightly into the illusion of a problem that they aren't able to step back and reassess the situation or recognise reality (and they can't let anyone else either)
Until they're almost just fighting themselves in the end.I also really appreciated that, while some arms of the bureaucracy may have been inept, the government was never portrayed as an evil entity, as it so often is in fiction

The military, CDC, Homeland Security, etc may have been failing, but they were legitimately trying to do the right thing and never once does some over zealous general order the needless killing of innocents.Truly, anyone who has ever filled out a form in triplicate and wondered how people who could require something so inane could also successfully run the world should be reading this book

Anyone who likes to see a little bit of science-speak in their fiction should be reading this book
Anyone who likes good ironic, situational comedy should be reading this book (though it's not ostensibly a comedy)

Really, anyone who is happy to read a book that digs a little deeper, but moves a little slower should be reading this book
Highly recommended.

$review_text.: Lucas is unseen
 He hides behind walls or ceiling tiles and whiles away his days watching people in office buildings and public places


 At night he sneaks out to raid the office fridge or work a few hours at a diner for some emergency money

 The only thing missing in his life is the love and human connection he sees in the people he watches.Lucas' simple, nomadic life becomes terribly complicated when he runs into Donovan, another guy who lives the unseen, behind-the-walls life that he does


 Donovan introduces him to the Creep Club, where Lucas starts to feel like he has found people who understand him

 But then he finds out how creepy the Club really is
 The Club members don't watch people in public places, but in their homes

 Disgusted, Lucas decides he wants no part of it, but he's already in too deep
 Before too long he is tangled in a web of secrets and espionage that he can't escape.When I first picked up this book I was worried that there might be some inappropriate scenes in the book (it is a book about people who watch people in their homes) but there was nothing like that

 The characters are not peeping toms

 Once that fear was relieved I was able to enjoy the book

 In fact, I was quite caught-up in the suspense, and didn't do much besides read for a few days until I finished it

 The pace was fast, the plot-twists were many and surprising, and I was very glad that the author eventually explained why Lucas remembered growing up in an orphanage when there are no orphanages in the U.S

today
 The climax of the book was a little strange and completely unexpected
 I was a little confused by the addition of genetic mutation in the plot, and thought it would have been less confusing and just as exciting without it.Overall, I highly recommend this book, and look forward to reading other books by this author.

$review_text.: 5 StarsThe Degas Girl by AJ AdamsIf you like dark romances like The Beast or the Dark Duet series, then this book is right up your alley. It is the second dark romance I've read by AJ Adams, and I have to say both have been great. The first one was The Bonus, which you should also check out. The Degas Girl is the complete story of Serenity and Zachary, no cliffhangers here.Serenity is a smart woman in a terrible fix. She is being kept as a slave and sex toy for Angelo, the son of a major organized crime lord. Angelo has tried everything to tame her, including torture, starvation, you name it. Angelo wants the satisfaction of turning an Oxford graduate into a whore, but Serenity is refusing to be tamed. She fights Angelo at every opportunity, no matter the consequences to her health or well being.Just when things are at their darkest, her savior comes in the unlikeliest form. Zachary is an art forger, thief, and deadly assassin for the very same crime family. Zachary, who has his own reasons for hating Angelo, witnesses him torturing Serenity and decides on a devious way to get back at Angelo. He decides to take custody of Serenity, taming her himself, thereby showing everyone that once again Angelo is a hapless fool. He will show her off to everyone at Angelo's arranged marriage by having her trained to give blow jobs to all the men in attendance.But what Zachary hadn't counted on was falling for this strong, yet fragile beauty. He finds in her a fellow kinship. You see Zachary did not exactly have a wonderful upbringing himself. They both have their scars, both visible and invisible.This book had me on the edge of my seat throughout. The suspense is taut, the danger is real, and the sex is hot. I could not put the book down, and I doubt you will be able to put it down either. Can love be built from such sordid beginnings? If The Degas Girl is any indication the answer is a resounding YES. As hard has it may be to believe, and as dark as this book can get at times, it is still a romance, and you will root for love to win out above all else.There are scenes of graphic violence and torture, so if that kind of thing bothers you then you might want to look elsewhere. But if you like a lot of dark excitement with your erotica, then you have got to check out The Degas Girl. I can't wait to see what AJ comes up with next.BLURB:Serenity Bishop is a work of art. Her skin a canvas, decorated with the scars of her evil captor&#8217;s twisted abuse. But her tormentor, Angelo, is about to lose control.Zachary Schiavelli is an art thief and forger. His handsome face is merely the mask that hides a cold, calculating man whose own childhood of abuse has honed him into a remorseless killing machine.Zachary is about to take an intense disliking to Angelo.Sometimes you need to fight fire with fire.In a violent tale of mob rule where violence begets violence, an unlikely alliance between two forces of nature is about to change the face of organized crime. When Serenity and Zachary collide, it&#8217;s an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object, and everyone around them is about to get caught in the crossfire.A complete novel with no cliffhangers.A violent tale of mob rule and dark romance. Warning contains explicit scenes of dubious consent, graphic violence and sex. Adults only.

$REVIEW.: Maybe the fact that I'm paying over $4 gallon for gas influenced my reading of the book.  Maybe it was the over the top environments message.  Maybe it was the flat characters.  I don't know, but the book just rubbed me the wrong way.  It felt like having Ralph Nader, Al Gore, PETA and Green Peace all whispering in my ear that the world was coming to end, save the environment for humanity. Trying to hide such a political message in the story was annoying and over the top.As for the characters, I just didn't get the love story part.  I didn't feel any connection to them.  As another person noted, why name a man Erin.  The male spelling is Aaron and it was confusing through the whole book.  I didn't find anything likable or endearing about Jenna.Overall, it's probably a good beach read, but I wouldn't want to buy it.  Check it out from your local library.

$review_text.: "The Defiant Agents" is the third novel of the "Time Traders" series by Andre Norton as it continues the conflict between Americans and the Russian Communists, as well as a mysterious alien race

But, I was surprised to find that most of the interactions in this novel take place very much in an Native American-like setting rather than a pure science fiction.This book is primary a story of Travis Fox and his group of fellow Apaches as they are marooned on an alien planet called Topaz with a surprised "Red" base and they are working on a way to abrogate the Russians and then plans on guarding the alien technology from any more invaders as they settled on the planet.This is fairly a short novel and an "okay" story about how people being stripped of their memory and awareness of modern life, and eventually left to settle on an alien planet


It sure is fast paced and can be an interesting read.

$REVIEW.: I took this book with me when I went with some friends to spend the day lazing in the sun on top of a ruined castle. We found a nice spot on the thick grassy wall overlooking the moat and forest. One friend dozed off while the other did cartwheels and ate pistachios, but not at the same time. In any case, my peals of laughter echoed down the valley again and again, and each time I had to explain to my friends just what was happening at that point in the story. They spent a lot of time frowning, scratching their heads, and declaring me to be crazy. Me, not the author, you'll notice.Need I say I enjoyed this book immensely? The concept of a garage sale hobby is familiar terrain, and it's been taken one step further with the Bargain Hunters' Network. Four women in vastly different life situations, yet bound together by friendship and the passion for chasing good prices.But this is more than just chick-lit. There's plenty of danger and excitement - there's a serious political conspiracy, a clumsy lawyer-turned-burglar with the girlfriend who learned how to break and enter from watching TV, a mechanical elk, a shopping-mall showdown, and a couple of elderly ladies who use guns, pepper sprays, lightswitches, and rouge powder to resist the villains.And there's certainly plenty to laugh about, as you've noticed from my experience atop the castle. Whether it's a three-year-old having a conversation with a robber in the middle of the night, or her mother making frantic phone calls while giving birth, or the skater dude giving the old man advice for his marriage, it is all just delectable. Good enough to eat."Death of a Garage Sale Newbie" is a treasure I will hold close to my heart. It's a murder mystery with a more personal touch than most, as the victim is a close friend of the women who end up finding the killer. The tale twists and turns incredibly and relies often on girl power and the potential for goodness hidden even in the bad guys.Ginger, the central character, goes through a tough period in her marriage as the plot unfolds, and it's a lovely side story to watch her efforts, so very human, and the way her friends support her. This victory marks the end of the story for now, but I've heard there's more to come in this series... bring it on!

$REVIEW.: Ananth writes a solid story. I would argue that only the most initial premise (spelling bees) is particularly original, but honestly, there are only so many stories in the world and the most important thing is a tale told well. In this, &#34;Buzz!&#34; is proof of the author's talent. It's a page-turner, with lots of action and snappy dialogue. The plot flows smoothly, and major events happen with enough regularity to keep things fresh. This does have the &#34;high-stakes battle, then higher-stakes battle!&#34; format like most &#34;shounen manga&#34;. Personally, it works for me and it works for the purposes of the story, but some folk might be turned off. But hey, it's what it said on the cover. The characters are also utterly charming, and I would love to see more of them. I would rate the writing 4/5 -- better than serviceable, but not quite perfect.The art, however, doesn't really live up to the story. The earlier review's comparison to Scott Pilgrim was apt, except that Scott Pilgrim had more comprehensible layouts. Now that's something I never thought I'd say! Independently, the characters are drawn in a way interpretable to the reader, but the composition is a mess and the transition between events is often unclear. A few times I actually wondered if a page was missing. I guess I would say the art is suited to standalone images, but lacks the comic fundamentals. It gets the job done, but writing of this caliber deserves better. (2.5-3/5)At the end of the day, I'd recommend this comic, but with the disclaimer that you will probably need to re-read portions to get a clear idea of the action. Thankfully, the writing is good enough that this doesn't feel like a huge encumbrance.
$SUMMARY.: I wish there were a way to give separate reviews for writing and art

I wish authors would say in their synopsis that it's a series and which number it is and if there will be more so we don't have to go hunting it down. I hate waiting and usually wait for all of them to come out so I can read them together. Now I find out there will be book 3. Hope I don't have to wait long.

$REVIEW.: I'm not usually a fan of erotica, but enjoyed reading this seductive, sexy and original story.  The characters were interesting -- especially the hero, who we only see through a window!  A very clever tale filled with well-written, evocative scenes that leap off the page.  I found the heroine fascinating, and loved all the Paris references.  I'm thinking the author must live there or has certainly visited that romantic city.  The hero is drop dead sexy with a sense of humor and a kind heart.  How did the author convey that through a window?  I have no idea, but she did!  Can't wait to read Michele Renae's next book in the series, &#34;Screen.&#34;

$review_text.: Dragged against her will to her very first anime convention, Christy is at once both overwhelmed and fascinated by everything the con has to offer...including her mysterious neighbor in the Artist's Alley, Matt. Unfortunately for Christy, she has a boyfriend (albeit a selfish, inattentive one) that she can't seem to say no to, even when he's being a jerk. Will she be able to make it out of the con alive??Dramacon is a definite departure from the fantasy world of &lt;a href="[...]">Night Silver&lt;/a>, and the more dramatic &lt;a href="[...]">Chasing Rainbows&lt;/a> (Svetlana's two web comic series), but as always both the art and story deliver with flying colors. Svetlana's simple, yet elegant style is true to the shojo manga form without compromising her own unique voice, nor getting lost in the minute details and forgetting to tell the story. Dramacon not only tells you the story, it lets you see, hear and even smell the world that Svetlana has created, making it easy to read in one sitting and yet fun to return to over and over again.Without hesitation, I can highly recommend Dramacon to anyone who likes shojo manga, or even just enjoys a great story. Three volumes are planned (and Svet is a little sketchy on the details for the next release date), but the first stands on its own as an excellent read that satisfies at the same time that it leaves you hungry for more.I especially liked Dramacon because it hit way too close to home for me. Every decision that Christy struggled with in the story was one that I had also experienced (sometimes at a con, no less!), especially her willingness to let her boyfriend walk all over her for the sake of saving the relationship in the beginning. Watching Christy grow and blossom through the story was a personal treat for me, and I am eagerly looking forward to the next installment!Or to put it in simpler terms...I &lt;font color="red">&lt;3&lt;/font> Dramacon!

$review_text.: I loved this book! Liam Wilder is your typical hot, sexy as sin professional athlete, but he is also so much more. It took him finding rising star soccer prodigy Kinsley Bryant to realize where he wanted his life to head.Kinsley Bryant is such a great female character. She is hilarious, caring and a very friendly person. I love that she doesn't come from a dark and twisted past. She has loving parents who love and support her and it shows in her personality. There were so many times that I thought she would lose her shit over what Tara or the media was doing to her, but she handled it all so well. She is your typical 19 year old looking to have a good time all the while trying to reach her dreams of playing soccer at the Olympic level. Which apparently she is pretty bad ass at soccer and so is Coach Wilder.The first time they meet is pretty great. I love that she is so loose lipped after having her birthday shots and says somethings to him she doesn't mean to. Only it is what works for his attraction to her. They had to be the cutest couple that I have read lately. They have such a great relationship right from the start. There isn't of the unnecessary drama that usually surrounds couples who are in the limelight. The only drama is psycho Tara and her obsession with being famous. Well, I guess that is not entirely true...the fact that at the beginning Liam is Kinsley's coach and they have such an attraction that neither can ignore could qualify as a tiny bit of drama. But Liam handles it really well and made me love him all the more for it. It was nice to read a book that all the drama was mostly centered on things outside of the relationship and that they couple stayed strong through it all.This story is well written and so are the characters. They are easily relatable and I connected with them instantly. I loved Becca, Emily and Penn. I love how this book opens up because you are instantly in love with Kinsley. The ending (epilogue) is pretty awesome too! Overall this is a great read and I would suggest reading it if you are looking for a sweet, sexy romance.

$review_text.: I recently got a copy of this book from Packtpub and went through it, working through the material on my local WAMP install.  I have to say that this is one of the best newbie books out there for Drupal. While I'm not a Drupal newbie, I enjoyed this book and can see the benefit it would hold for any audience.The author assumes that you have no knowledge of Drupal and walks you step by step from the beginning of the install to configuring your website, to adding the functionality needed to start building a social networking site.The directions are simple and easy to follow, but beyond giving directions, the author explains the "why" of doing things, which is great when you're thinking of moving forward.  This book will serve as a great launching pad for anyone thinking of building not just a social networking site, but really anything with Drupal, because it gives you a good hands on experience building a Drupal website.If you're experienced in Drupal you may want to skip the first couple of chapters, but there's something to be learned from this book no matter your level of experience.

Therefore I was delighted to find this book as it outlines 50 different lunch recipes that I can prepare and all of which are truly delicious.I was also pleased to find the recipes were quick to prepare as I only allow a 30-minute lunch break this was ideal for me too. Our favourite recipe is the chicken fajitas. To think also we have 10 weeks worth of lunches here to try out before rotating them all over again.

$REVIEW.: I downloaded The Beholder because I took a free peek on Amazon.com, and then couldn't put it down. Apparently, the book is the first of what will be a series starring Maddie Richards - a smart, tough, tenacious female police detective in Phoenix, Arizona. Maddie is a good cop, and her competence is confirmed by the fact that she has one of the highest solve rates in the US. The Beholder chronicles Maddie's pursuit, and unmasking, of a serial killer of women. I should make it clear here that this is not chick lit, and Maddie is not your typical "lady detective". This is a straightforward police procedural with a fully fleshed protagonist. It's a bit gruesome in spots, but not gratuitously so. In a way, Maddie reminds me a bit of Brenda in the television drama The Closer. I look forward to following her career.
$SUMMARY.: Beholder a Terrific Read

$REVIEW.: There is one line throughout this book that sticks with me, and which I think, sums up the tone of this book."Each person is entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts."From climate change, race, election, and media, to everything else in between.I found Amy's reading short, sweet, and to the point, the political leanings were sown into the writing--which was expected--but more than anything, I got a history lesson from this book.The best analogy that I can think of (and this might be horrible, let me know?) but imagine if Howard Zinn were a reporter, and instead of reporting the facts of the real history several hundred years ago, but instead was doing it day by day, as it happened."Nothing but the facts ma'am" and Amy delivers!Mass Casualties: A Young Medic's True Story of Death, Deception, and Dishonor in Iraq

$review_text.: At the beginning of this book it promised it would change readers' lives. That's a bold claim, I thought somewhat cynically. But after reading it I can't dispute it from personal experience!The Ludy's make a passionate  appeal for God-centered romance and purity, using their own lives (warts  and all) as a case study. Although the book is not proscriptive (that is,  it does not give a set of rules to follow) it does an excellent job of  providing biblical principles and insight for singles seeking to avoid the  pitfalls and traumas of dating. And in our current holocaust of abortion,  divorce, romance-related suicide and depression, STD's and more, there's is  a message that is desperately needed.This book is an inspiration,  that's for sure. Just reading it gave me a wholesome feeling and reminded  me that there are other godly singles out there seeking His best in their  lives. As I learned in the years following my own romance-related suicidal  depression as a teen, faith in God and attention to His Word really is the  solution to all our problems. Kudos to the Ludy's for spreading that truth.

$review_text.: A different kind of twist to God/Human relations.  I found the story line very imaginative. Love the reference to D.I.C.KTHe God's very own PR organization.  This book had alot of memorable characters as well very hot well written sex scenes. Mercury and Dillon seem to be a perfect match, While Vesta, the Goddess of Virginity, and the two Norse Gods Loki and Thor, (love the fact that these two Gods, known for their rivalry, were "paired" up as Vesta's Love interest) finally gets her groove going on Thor's Yacht of all places. Thetis makes an appearance as well, and finds herself a hot piece of vampire Male, to keep her warm. Alot happens inbetween the romance, yet it doesn't detract at all from the story or pace.This book is going into my "Favs" list on my kindle, as one that I will be reading time and again...thankyou Ms. Harris for yet another wonderful addition to the world of literature!

$review_text.: I am truly scratching my head over the reviews for this book. Did I read the same one? Amazon indicates that I did.And yet this book just simply isn't up to par as a reliable source of information. I'm sorry if this sounds harsh - I am only being totally honest here - but this book illustrates yet another example of an unqualified, inexperienced person writing about something they don't understand.Marta cites herself as a massage therapist and wellness coach. There are no mentions of aromatherapy or spa therapy studies and I wonder aloud whether she's actually engaged in any formal study of all modalities cited.My points of conjecture regarding the instructions outlined in this book are:1. She advocates the use of essential oils in neat form. While there are some essential oils that are safe to apply to the skin in their undiluted form, many are irritants and can burn or create a rash on the skin. This is especially important to consider while using them in a bath for contact with mucosa (eg. nose, vagina, anus) can prove to be problematic. You always use a base when adding to a bath or skin. This is paramount for beginners and with the use of known irritants such as clove and cinnamon.2. Aromatherapy works in more than two ways. She only lists two as the definitive method of practice. Simply not true.3. States her top 10 essential oils but does not state why and does not list precautions.4. States that jojoba is an oil. It's not. It's a wax.5. Lists the use of all essential oils for children and in pregnancy as absolute verboten. This is simply not true. And if you are going to consult with anyone it should be with a qualified and experienced aromatherapist not a doctor as the latter simply do not have the knowledge required. If anything, it's wise to utilise the two in conjunction with one another.6. States that a massage of grapefruit essential oil will eliminate a hangover.7. Claims that you can prevent hair loss with carrier and essential oils.8. Lists German and Roman Chamomile as being the same essential oil used for the same thing.These and other glaring inaccuracies deeply concern me given that the author states she is a teacher and has students. It's no wonder that the science of aromatherapy is not taken seriously when you have people with no experience declaring themselves experts and attempting to write accordingly.While I won't complain ardently that I purchased this book because it was listed as free for a long time and is now 99c, it is with good reason that the price is so low.  If you are starting out and you're looking for a good book that covers natural beauty treatments and aromatherapy, look for authors such as Stephanie Tourles and Dr Pamela Taylor.

$REVIEW.: I was surprised that I liked this book as much as I did - I mean, how original could a bestseller about a New York call girl be?  However, the writing is refreshingly vivid with a sense of pure honesty next to the grittiness.  The story takes place over one year as we follow Bennington, a 19-year old acting student, through her experiences with creepy johns, her dealings with messed-up divorced parents and their new spouses, her corky friendships and eventually her quest for a real love affair.  Lots of dark humor, mental instability, and heart break peppered with stereotypical images of New York and its inhabitants. An interesting read for a debut novel.

$REVIEW.: This is the 3rd book in the Annie Ogden series but the first one that I have read.** I was never lost to any references, therefore I would say that it works as a stand-alone as well. I'll start out with the format. Nothing I love more in a format than short chapters! I need a convenient place to stop reading, if I'm so inclined to do so. This book definitely made me want to get to the next chapter quickly. The character descriptions were well thought out but the actions lacked a bit of believability. While the plot was similar to many stories, it still had you guessing who the murderer was up until the end. I usually like to feel something for the characters I read about. I had no real connection with any of them. That being said, it still didn't stop me from reading and staying engaged in the story.**I received a copy of Collateral Damage (An Annie Ogden Mystery) in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: This book should be a mandatory &#34;read&#34; for anyone entering their AA Program to get the full story of how AA started.  Bill W. and Dr. Bob are and always will be credited with creating AA but Ebby was the man who got Bill W. sober and introduced him to a spiritual group called &#34;The Oxford Group&#34;, where all the principles of recovery were in place.  In fairness to Bill W., he put them down as the 12 Steps, so as to make it easier to grasp but little is often said about the true beginnings.Also, Ebby was not able to hold onto his sobriety over the years and was in and out of the &#34;Program&#34; - not the &#34;perfect&#34; example of recovery that we know of Dr. Bob and Bill W. However, for those who struggle to stay sober or have those they love struggling, it affirms that even when trying desperately (as Ebby did - hospitalizations, drugs, homeless on the street), it is not always possible to hold onto recovery.A &#34;must read&#34; book!

The story is a short teaser of what I now hope will be MUCH, MUCH MORE to Come. Nyal is one tough chick & her story is a testament to that strength. Gon does not show up in the book as often as we would like (yes I said we - as in I bet you any poll of this series readers would show) but as it turns out I missed his character more then I realize.The short version to this short story is just buy it - it is after all 3 books into the series - you really don't have a choice. Not that you need one, this novella will more then whet your appetite. Now if we can just get the author to focus enough to write the next book! Might I suggest someone who knows him does a Kathy Bates / Stephen King on him... Well maybe just a swift kick instead.

 Overall, this quick read is enjoyable and entertaining and certainly arouses a lot of curiosity, the only problem is it inspired too much curiosity and I found that I had a lot of questions about things that are left unexplained
These questions are about the world building and why things happen that relate to the aliens, so if the story had been longer and given more insight, I would have enjoyed it more but the romance is a wonderful short read.See my full review at: The Jeep Diva .com

$REVIEW.: On  a Quest for Christ begins with this scripture : May all who search for you be filled with joy and gladness.May those who love your salvation repeatedly shout,"The Lord is Great!"  (Psalms 40;16)  Many times our search  for joy and gladness comes up null and void

Psalms 40:16 encourages the reader that their search for Jesus will be filled with joy and gladness

 I am a deep thinker who tends to tear everything apart and reflect on every tiny morsel


Some might say I pick things apart and  have a tendency to over-think things

Inside Lisa s book I was able to reflect on numerous things

Which makes the analytical part of my personality very happy.I recommend On a Quest for Christ for any reader who desires to dig deeper into their spiritual journey
 Each chapter is precisely written with great clarification for each given subject


 I absolutely adored the format that Lisa used 
 The individual sections are  comprehensively constructed to help the reader gain more knowledge and understanding of the given topic


 A passage from the bible is given first


Secondly a description of the topic at hand


Thirdly Lisa weaves a personal story from her life which intertwines with the selected theme
Then reflections are given to help you dig deeper inside your journey
Afterwards four questions are asked of the reader 


 Following the questions are  blank spaces for you to fill in your answers


 Concluding each chapter is a prayer written by Lisa and space for you to write your own personal prayer as well.I have a couple of favorite parts of the book, I want to share with you
 One favorite is where Lisa writes Augustine believed there is a God shaped hole in every person, and we won't be happy until its filled
Another part that I adored is ; The past could not be recaptured and the future was a tapestry yet to be woven
My soul rested in Gods hands.I gained a new perspective on my spiritual journey while reading On a Quest for Christ


I feel as though my own God shaped hole is being filled with a deeper understanding of Christ
My prayer for you is that while you are reading this book your own God shaped hole will begin to close and you will gain a deeper relationship and understanding  ~Disclosure I received a copy of this book as a part of the CWA review crew

She does, however, know she does not want Nate Navely to have any interest in her cousin Rose. She knows he's not a great guy and breaks hearts as he goes. She doesn't like him much either. She decides one day she is going to turn the tables on Nate and give him a taste of his own medicine. Little does she know, her feelings are soon going to change and she has no control over it.This story was a short, cute tale of high school and flirting and &#34;love&#34;. The writing as fun and coming from a British author it was refreshing to read a story with no apologies for its sexual nature.

$review_text.: In attempting to start a meaningful dialogue about the criminal justice system in the United States (a discussion which is worth having), V
E

Kappeler and Gary Potter manage to descend to the level of holier-than-thou activist high school students, spouting the most contrived, predictable "arguments" against what they see as dangerous legal and political institutions that negatively impact all sectors of society except the one that is to be reviled the most: the rich, white male upper class that dominates America and oppresses everyone with anything less than a six figure income.The pros: "the Mythology of Crime and Criminal Justice" is written in clear, accessible language that just about anyone can understand

As far as propaganda is concerned, this book is some of the best I've ever read.The cons: pretty much everything else
Here are the basic tenets of the worldview promoted by the authors of this book: behaviors that are defined as "crime" are only designated as such because they are the common activities of societally disadvantaged groups and the rich white male power structure perceives them as threats; it is irrational to fear being the victim of a crime - for instance, only a very small percentage of people are ever murdered, so a person should not worry about being killed (unless it is by a rich white male such as Lee Iacocca, who was, according to the authors, personally responsible for the deaths of every single person who died in accidents involving the Pinto); the justice system is of course institutionally racist, as demonstrated by the fact that minorities are overrepresented in prison populations (which is certainly not due to the fact that minorities commit more crimes but rather that rich white males are simply never prosecuted for theirs); that concepts such as "the law" and "the justice system" are simply mechanisms for social control by (who else?) rich white males; and that the very concept of crime itself must be reinterpreted in several social contexts, ignoring the bourgeois ethics of rich white males.There is a chapter on the death penalty written by Gary Potter's wife, whom I will not identify by her own name because I am a bigoted, intolerant person (and because I no longer own the book)

Again, a discussion about the death penalty is definitely one worth having (it is, after all, the ultimate punishment and is not perfect) but the chapter relates truly very little to exposing any "myths" about the death penalty and instead concentrates on tugging at the reader's heart strings with anecdotes about children and minorities being put to death
She then asserts that the death penalty must be considered as an entire institution rather than on an individual basis, ironically throwing out any reason the reader might have had to consider the section with individual examples that I just mentioned.Sarcasm and joking aside, "the Mythology of Crime and Criminal Justice" does its readers a disservice by claiming that it is a meaningful contribution to the debate about the American criminal justice system

There are very real questions that deserve to be seriously addressed, but the authors seem to have no desire to do this, preferring instead to throw around slogans taken from the likes of Zinn, Chomsky, and Nader, in an effort to establish genuine liberal credentials


Avoid this book unless you are (a) researching propaganda in American higher eduction or (b) already a "true believer" in the claims brought up in "the Mythology of Crime and Criminal Justice."

$REVIEW.: I read about 40% of this before giving up. The whole situation is preposterous, and the writing is pretty bad as well. Our hero, the guy who has a dream that compels him to go on a quest, is continually being saved, not by his own abilities, but by some sort of miraculous intervention. I finally decided Rushed wasn't going to get any better and started reading First Contact (The Last War Trilogy, Book 1 (In Her Name). Ridiculous title, but the writing is excellent.

$REVIEW.: I purchased Vaz because I've enjoyed Laurence Dahners other books.I'm happy I did. Vaz is rather unusual, brilliant, but clearly an oddball highly focused individual. I thought the family interactions was well done, and it illustrates how even really unusual odd people can function well in our society as long as they have a supporting family. I liked the science, but mostly I enjoyed a story that was unusual. I read a lot and look for something different in my stories, Laurence delivers.At .99 cents I'm not too picky what I buy. If I have an idea I'll enjoy the story, $2.99 is no barrier. However, at the $3.99 level, I like to be a little more confident it's a good buy as I often purchase well in advance of reading. Given the enjoyment I've gotten out of Laurence Dahners other books, I just purchased all his stuff. So far I've not been disappointed. Take a chance. It's fun.

 I always like to know the 'why' behind a serial killer


But, that's just my personal preference

It definitely did not affect my enjoyment of this gruesome story.Overall:If you liked Serial at all, you will love this even more
It's not quite as gory, but there's a time and a place for everything

This novella hits the bull's eye for action/suspense fans who like a little blood and gore on the side.

I also enjoy an epilog as it helps bring closure to the story and gives the reader a happy feeling to see the characters in the future. My only complaint with this story was the length versus the price.

$review_text.: Sometimes extreme measures are necessary to shake us out of the insulated bubbles of our comfort zones. Mike Yankoski realized that the Christian life he was living was one safely removed from the "least of these." He was passing homeless people on his way to an air-conditioned church every Sunday. So Yankoski decides to take some extreme measures.The social experiment as recounted in Under the Overpass was designed to give him firsthand experience of life as a homeless American. Five months on the streets in six cities with his friend Sam.The account is riveting. Yankoski tells the stories so you feel the discomfort, live the fear, and meet the people. He lends humanity to the people we often treat as sub-human. The six cities that Mike and Sam visit become characters themselves in the story, each bringing unique challenges and lessons.One thing that Yankoski does especially well is relating his experiences as lessons to the reader without coming across as preachy.  The narrative and lessons flow together seamlessly and Yankoski weaves Scripture in as well, to great effect.I highly recommend this book to any Christian who wants to be shaken out of their comfort zone. Beware, however. You may be reminded that the life and love Jesus calls us to may require extreme measures.

$REVIEW.: I just read "5 Cities that Ruled the World" by Douglas Wilson. It is the first book of the author's that I have reviewed, and the first book of this type that I have reviewed. It was easily read, and might be a good companion to a more rigid book of history.The five cities discussed are Jerusalem, Athens, Rome, London, and New York. The author offers a narrative and selective history of each city's legacy to the modern world. From the text (notwithstanding the author's comments) my understanding is that the legacies are as follows: Jerusalem - a legacy of the heart; Athens - the legacy of reason; Rome - the legacy of the Republic and the Papacy; London - the legacy of literature; New York - the legacy of wealth.The book ends with an epilogue that is best to be avoided. It appears to belong to an entirely different book, and it rambles around various ideas that the author might have been well served to include in the text for each city.My only argument with the author's occasional bold statements is that he insists the United States is an empire. It is not, it has never been, and it has no designs of ever becoming an empire.  Economic and cultural influence is not the same as empire.

$REVIEW.: I really wasn't impressed with Ms. Hamilton efforts at writing Anita Blake et al efforts to attend something 'normal'.There was something so uninspiring and lazy about this particular storyline that I almost felt insulted.  How many times are the readers going to be told that Nathaniel is the 'stay at home wife' of their little group?  That Micah is short, that his eyes are different, that Nathaniel has long hair, blah, blah?  If a reader comes into this storyline after over 10 full-length books then they have absolutely no cause to complain about the lack of descriptive development.If I'm going to spend my money, the author could at least put some effort into writing a story that would hold my attention more than 1 minute.The original Anita Blake novels were fun, entertaining and utterly held my attention from start to finish.  The old Anita Blake was a flawed character just like everyone else.  She was aware of her flaws and worked to overcome her shortcomings. She wasn't a bad-ass, or at least she didn't think she was; she merely did what she had to do to survive.Ms. Hamiliton set the standard for me when she created Anita Blake and I've been hooked on these type of heroines ever since.  Women that were flawed individuals, characters that are still growing, evolving and finding where they fit in the world.  There was something almost vulnerable about the Anita Blake of old.Lately this new evolution of Anita Blake is cocky, arrogant with an unshakable belief that she is the baddest, bad-ass of all times.  She is...(insert drumroll) the Executioner!I haven't given up on this series and this particular little gem has me teetering on the edge.  I hate to say this, but if the next book don't deliver, it may be the last book of the Anita Blake novel that I invest in.

It has been the best of the kids books for my five year old


She has taken this book with her to school to share with her class, and we read it every night before bed.It puts not just what a hero is in words that little ones can relate to it also explains what Dad does and how he lives in ways that they can understand


Having a place to put a picture of their hero inside and one of them also makes it even more personal for your child or children


My 15 year old has even sat down and read this book with his younger brother(11) and sister(5)

I would tell anyone that has a child or knows a child dealing with a deployment to buy this book...maybe even two so one can always travel with you!

$REVIEW.: This book is very cute, I guess that's mostly how I'd describe it. Full of true love, adventure and a close family.The 2 main characters in the waking world anyways are funny, honest and adventurous.The adventure Chris and Walter Jr. take is one that probably everyone who reads wishes it'd be true. The people they meet on their adventure are so kind. something you don't find  much in the world today.It's a good read, with a lot of adventure, fun times, comical at some times, heartfelt moments between a grandfather and grandson, kind strangers, a true love that we all wish we had or have , will have someday any of them.It's worth the read though at times I felt it was like a teenagers storybook but that's part of what made it a good story, the wise old man like a young man. a young man learning to be wise at a young age.Read it if you believe in true love, like adventure, family closeness and wish dreams came true or were true.I received this book for honest review.

$review_text.: Dawn IS pretty hot. She isn't your conventional storybook heroine with typical cliches. There was no lovesick girl with delusions in this book. Dawn was sure of herself and what she wanted. She didn't fall for the sappy lines or put up with the crap that was given to her.She was my ideal heroine - one that was long needed in the NA genre.The best feature in Theirs To Play was the characters. They were well developed and had layers of complexity. They were the type to laugh with and get frustrated with. Kenya Wright has an obvious talent with writing, a strong and clear voice apart from the typical characters.The love triangle (yes, there were two guys and the possibility of another one in the end. Oops. Spoiler!) was one of the good ones I've read. There's a fine line in books with love triangles, and Ms. Wright balanced herself pretty well.Of course, no book is unblemished. I read in Goodreads that Wright had impeccable writing style, grammar, spelling, and composition. I decided to watch out for those common errors that authors tend to make. There was the occasion misspelled word (site instead of sight, taut instead of taught, its instead of it's). This was a huge turn off, especially in the steamy scenes. There were around eight of these errors - which aren't all that bad compared to the others I've read.Despite its flaws, Theirs To Play is a definite must-read. If you're looking for an independent, strong heroine in a love triangle, I strongly suggest you read this book. A definite warning for you though; it has a &#34;cliffy&#34; in the end. Good luck with that, if you're planning to read it.

$review_text.: The only thing worse than public speaking, for me at least, is having to get up in front of people and speak with little to no warning. Without time to at least prepare a speech, I've never been able to pull it off without a lot of &#34;ummmm&#34; and head scratching. This book is such a powerful resource for overcoming the public speaking jitters! It taught me how to really think on my feet, like developing my skills at speaking on any topic by learning to use my flow of consciousness and how talk about even just an object for five minutes.  The section on the &#34;Biggest Secret of Public Speaking&#34; created the proverbial light bulb over my head as I had a major &#34;AHAH!&#34; moment while reading it. Suddenly the idea of giving an impromptu speech seems simple, instead of yet another opportunity to stutter and look like an idiot. I also enjoyed the numerous examples of various effective speeches given at the end that illustrate how to deliver a speech that really engages the listeners. I'd absolutely recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their ability to get up in front of people and talk, whether it's to impress the VPs at the annual corporate party or just for family at Christmas.

$review_text.: This short story is a charming look at Edith, a sexually repressed woman, and Clark, a transman, and Edith's eyes being opened not just to her own sexuality but to the world at large. Everything was tastefully handled and the language is reminiscent of a much older time period (as if it were written in that time, not just taking place then).It is an almost simple story dealing with complex issues, and while some may challenge the somewhat insta-love qualities, I felt it was fitting for the characters. Considering Edith's limited emotional engagement and her sudden awakening, plus Clark's state, finding one another would lead them to do considerably rash things, and I felt it was appropriate for the characters.The writing, the style, the feel of the story, and the characters all fell into place to form a superb short story. While there is a lot we are never told due to its length, we are not left wanting either.A sweet, thoughtful story that lets the reader finish the story.

I have bought books before to study and prepare my son for the Naglieri test and found that some of the artwork was off or that the questions were wrong. That isn't the case with this one. The writer certainly knows his stuff. Not only did he write the book that Mr David linked. He also hasTesting Survival Guide for OLSAT Test and Practice for Otis-Lennon School Abilities Test (Testing Survival Guide by TestingMom.com)andTesting Survival Guide for CogAT - Practice for Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT Test) (Testing Survival Guide by TestingMom.com). Any of his books will prove that he knows what he is talking about, this one included. I am convinced that this is the best book on Kindle to prepare for a Naglieri test.

$REVIEW.: What the heck? I am really irritated, and should probably wait to settle down before writing this review. And maybe I will return and update this, later. But for now, seriously? What did I just read?While the storytelling was frequently disjointed and clumsy, I was interested enough in this tale of three teens with XP, flirting with life, death and adrenaline. I always enjoy a good mystery. And an enigmatic character like Juliet goes a long way to add depth to any character tale.But a few things lost me along the way. Was there even a murder at all? Did Juliet EVER tell the truth, in any of her emotional confessionals?Half the time I didn't know what was going on, which is sometimes okay in a thriller-type novel, because we expect a good payoff in the end.Said lack of any sort of satisfying ending is the real kicker here. For one thing, I didn't realize this book was not a stand alone novel. Any warning would have been thoughtful.And two, even novels in a series should end on some kind of resting point - some moment of note where there's a breather in the storytelling. This one doesn't even emerge as a cliffhanger ending - it simply stops, mid-climax.What? Who does this?It's a rotten trick to play on the reader. I'm pretty annoyed with the writer, and in the time I trusted to see how things would play out. I'm left with nothing: no payoff, a lot of muddy misdirection, and not enough engagement in the antagonist (ZOMG! is he or isn't he?) to breathlessly await the next book.There was enough to like here and keep me reading, but In the end I just feel tired. And slightly depressed. The second book would do well to give the reader some meat, instead of these too-rare ephemeral moments of cohesion.

$REVIEW.: Do you believe in angels? Even those who don't profess to be Bible believing, born again Christians say that they do. It seems there's always an angel story circulating online or a sighting or a report of an angelic encounter. How do we discern the real deal?Dr.Jeremiah takes the reader on a journey through scripture that documents the Biblical accounts of who angels are and why they exist. You might call this the A to Z guide on angels, for he shares details about their divine purpose, where they came from, and what we can learn from them. This is of particular importance, he says, in light of the increased demonic activity in this generation.Using the Bible as a guide, he points out how the purpose of a study of angels is to draw us closer to God.  He encourages us to test stories about angels to see if they glorify God in the right way, and help bring salvation. Highlighted also are the attributes of angels; which gives us an example of how to worship and honor Him.What about the fallen angels? What is their place in God's plan? Knowing the enemy's traits and tactics is important, Jeremiah says, to avoid being deceived by Angels of Light. I like how he covers this area, too, for I think we need to be equipped in this way for the big and little challenges that come our way.Did you know that the word angel means messenger? We also learn that angels impart strength, guidance, and deliverance for God's people. Now that's something to rejoice about!Whether you agree or disagree with Dr. Jeremiah's stance on the subject, his well documented research is worthy of consideration. I plan on hanging on to this book and reading it again.

$REVIEW.: This novel reminded me of why I love historical fiction: to get so immersed in a story that I feel like I'm transported to a different time. Spirit of Lost Angels did that for me. It was interesting to read a story told through the eyes of a peasant rather than a member of the nobility or aristocracy. Victoire lived quite a life! She is a fictional character, but the story was such that it was easy to believe she was a real person. Perrat did a great job of making Victoire believable, mainly because she made her slightly flawed. Too often the heroine in HF is overly perfect and much too forward thinking for the time period. Victoire definitely had some revolutionary ideas/thoughts, but they were fitting for France in the late 1700's. This is one of those books that I know will stick with me for a long time.I wish I could go into more depth in my review, but there's no way to do so without including spoilers. I will say that Perrat impressed me enough that I'll be seeking out her other books, especially Wolfsangel. 5 stars.For full disclosure, I received my copy of SOLA from the author. However, I'm not inflating my rating--I truly loved it.

$review_text.: I don't now recall how it happened over 17 years ago, but when I stumbled on the URL known as "ZETA TALK", I somehow knew that this was more "HIDDEN TRUTH", and that the 4th dimensional beings, originally from Zeta Reticuli now live right alongside we 3rd dimensional humans, and can literally occupy the same space (and time) without our even seeing them
 Perhaps you remember the "ROSWELL FLAP" about the crashed "FLYING SAUCER" (1947)that our government tried to "Cover-up" by calling it a "weather balloon"

Ha-ha --- and later, it was even called "swamp gas"


 Well, the book called ZETA TALK, by Nancy Lieder is a big help to understand it all
 Zetatalk (the URL) was initially some 15 chapters, with many many hyperlinks in each, so it represents an awful lot of valuable information that everyone on earth should know about
 I highly recommend you read it soon!

$review_text.: When I first picked up this book and realized the main character is named "Tori Hunter," I was a little concerned.  You see, I live in Minnesota and one of my favorite players on the Minnesota Twins baseball team is outfielder Torii Hunter.  Let me put your fears to rest... Tori in the book is NOTHING like Torii on the field... She's much, much more intriguing.Tori is a homicide detective who has had six male partners in as many years.  Her partners either threaten to quit or they are injured on the job, so she gets assigned to someone else.  Known as cold and heartless, many of her peers shun the idea of being assigned as her partner.In walks Samantha Kennedy.  Samantha has recently been reassigned to Homicide per her request and is Tori's new partner.  Samantha's boyfriend doesn't support this career choice because he envisions their marriage, children and grandchildren.  (Note: Her boyfriend is more of a frightening comic relief than a part of the real story.  He seems almost seemed like an afterthought on the author's part.  Hill builds the tension between Sam and her boyfriend, almost turning it violent when she tells him it's over.  However, even that tension doesn't play a pivotal part in the story.)As Sam begins to break down Tori's rigid exterior, she begins to have feelings for a woman for the first time in her life.  Confused, but intrigued, she doesn't resist.  Tori can't deny the growing magnetism she feels for Sam and struggles with allowing the other woman in.Hill is undeniably one of my favorite authors.  Her characters seem to spring to life.  Admittedly, they are a little "more" than real, but that's what makes her books so fantastic.  `Hunter's Way' is a welcome addition to my personal, permanent collection.  Highly recommended.

$review_text.: It was going to be a marriage of convenience: a temporary marriage of convenience.Sam needed to provide the perfect family picture to a judge in case his ex-wife, Jasmine, decided she didn't like the arrangements she had agreed to in the divorce. Rosie needed a cash influx for her business so she wouldn't have to face her ex-fiance, Dean, to obtain a new loan. Each had a need. Each had a solution. Easy, right? Not when you throw in dormant feelings, exes who want to cause trouble and secrets too dangerous to be shared. Then anything can happen.Stories with characters all living and interacting in the same small town are some of my favorite books to read. I really enjoyed this very romantic story of long time friends who started with a relationship in friendship that slowly morphs into love. The story unfolded at a steady pace, fleshing out the main characters. This is the first novel in the Sweetwater Springs Series. Although it is a standalone novel, the characters for the next novel, Her Unexpected Family, Claire and Travis were introduced and mentioned throughout the book.This was my first time reading works by Carol Burnside, but it definitely will not be my last. Looking forward to more novels in this series.I would recommend to all romance readers.5/5 stars  From friendship to love is sometimes be a bumpy ride, but so worth it.

$REVIEW.: You do not see IR books with a BW/AM, ever.  The closest that I can think of is the Battaglia Series by Sienna Mynx, but I am stretching that.  Because of this, I immediately bought the book.  The story was fun, I enjoyed.  It was your typical boy (who happens to be a major int&#8217;l pop star) meets regular working class gal who has no clue who he is at first then the normal situation of how can she fit in his world?  Will she be accepted?  Yes, a predictable story line, but with BW/AM twist.  I like learning Korean words.  (Although I still don&#8217;t know the translation of Jahgi.  I will have to reread, I may have missed it.)  The band members were fun and would love to read a short side story on all of them.  I am interested in K-Pop so I had my own visuals, the fictional band in the story, T4L it was Super Junior/M and Big Bang. (For G.K. my visual was the rapper G-Dragon.)  For the hero Kai, my visual was the hottie in the Fast & Furious movies Sung Kang, sometimes Daniel Dae Kim.  I had to give the author a ding for the grammar/spelling errors found in the book. But overall, it was an enjoyable little read.  Thanks Ms. G.  Oh, and if anyone knows of any IR books with a BW/AM let me know, would love to read more.

But, I found that the depth and richness of the story far surpassed the simplistic figures on the cover.  Yes, there was humor, and I fell in love with the "seme" and "uku" because of that very reason.  But, there was so much of this story that I liked, that it's hard to pin down just one or two.  I don't know if anyone else caught this, but it was kind of a mystery to me which character was going to play which role up until the very end.  I absolutely loved the portrayl of a power struggle in the bedroom over who was going to have the dominate role in the relationship, i.e. fox fight scene.  LOL...I think I'm hooked on demon stories now!  I would love it if the author would continue on this storyline with seperate stories that encompassed the lives of some of the minor characters. i.e. The young white fox that was at the party.  It would be fun to read a story about him finding some one of his own!

$REVIEW.: Patterns and helpful directions for a wide range of simple, cute, geeky amigurumi
The dolls are suitable as gifts in their own right, giftwrap decorations, holiday ornaments or stocking stuffers, Halloween bag treats for a special ghoul or boy, cubicle decorations, sachets, even cat toys or baby rattles if you're careful with the small parts


One of the things I like is that most of the accessories and details for the figures are easy to swap out and mix, so you can make a monkey in a top hat, a Cthulhu in a bikini or a zombie ninja (are they nombies? are they zinjas? I don't know!)
Also, each one uses a ridiculously small amount of yarn, so they're a great way to use up leftovers.I don't understand how anyone could rate this book down for clarity of instructions

I think the most complicated crochet project I'd done was a hexagonal potholder and I was able to follow the directions just fine

It's not meant to be a basic how-to-crochet book; it uses mostly a few simple stitches
There are directions on working the very few specialty stitches, and on things specific to amigurumi like making eyes and miniature accessories out of Fimo.I'm not sure what the logic was behind the difficulty ratings on some of the projects: the monkey, which requires making a fez and vest about as difficult as the basic body and head themselves, is "epic" difficulty, but the Cthulhu, with very fiddly little tentacles and wings, is supposedly only "intermediate"
Whatever, it's still a well-done book with great photos and adorable projects.If you're a beginner, arm yourself with some YouTube crochet tutorials, use nice acrylic or wool instead of cotton yarn, and working with a smaller hook than you're used to will probably be your biggest challenge.

$REVIEW.: some reviewers found typos and errors in attachment points of muscles etc..  some found it hard going thru the descriptive anatomy sectionsusing physio-terminologies and correct asana names in sanskrit..these are valid concerns and could sink an ordinary work..however, descriptions of applied practice and teaching are given in plainenglish anyone can follow and understand..  the object obviously is toteach the subject to serious readers a genuine interest..so perhaps it isnt suitable for most novices or those seeking a beginners guide to basic yoga..  then again, yoga itself isnt for everybody..this is an A4+ sized book of over 200pages with comprehensive index..solid paperback with strong pages printed in california..references to specialist material subject by subject thru the book..text is clear and readable without my reading glasses..handles like a good heavy magazine type publication..it arrived [in australia] well packed ahead of timefor about $20.. thats serious value in quality reading..body sections are covered, comprehensively, from the anatomyto applied practice and applied teaching [theres a hint]..despite some reviewers rejecting the presentation i found the clearink drawings with colors to be easily digestible and excellent..within descriptions of anatomy, movement, asanas etc there is a wealthof information not usually provided.. i found it interesting the sectionon the sacrum and sacro-illiac joint [often overlooked] includingeg, that hormonal changes due to menstruation, pregnancy, lactationsoften the female sacral ligaments responsible for joint support..that the female joint has a smaller and flatter surface for joint articulation..that the female joint articulates at only two segments with the pelvis[instead of three for the male]..  given the structure and nature ofthis 'wedge' joint which is pushed down into the pelvis when standingby weight of the torso, this explains one reason my teachers oftenadvise menstruating or pregnant or lactating women to considervariations in some asanas, such as some inversions etc..these few hints cant really serve as a complete review of this work..it is a self evident attempt at a definitive textbook of its kind..i have no hesitation in recommending it to any serious yoga studentor yoga teacher or for that matter medical professionals seekingan understanding of postural and movement anatomy in hatha yoga..despite typos etc, it must get the 5 stars..

$review_text.: The pros of this book, in my opinion, are that it is an unusual story, the descriptions of places interesting and colourful and the characters well drawn, the sentences short and sharp.The cons are much more.I did not like the 'modern' way of writing speech - just change of line, most times - and often had to backtrack to discover who was supposed to be saying what. The psycho mumbo-jumbo was often frustrating and intentions were unclear and convoluted.An unusual book but one that left me deeply depressed.

$REVIEW.: From Reading and Writing Urban Fantasy and Paranormal RomanceAt a GlanceIt's as simple as this, Rotter World is the best zombie book I have read by far.The GoodFlesh Craving...There is no need to summarize this book because Baker did an excellent job of that in his own book summary. So let's get down to the nitty-gritty. I loved this book so much I had a hankering for some flesh once I turned the last page. After satisfying my hunger by chewing on my pinkie for a bit, you couldn't stop me from spreading my love of this book. A zombie book is a zombie book, until you read Rotter World. A story of raw emotion, gore beyond comprehension, and the lengths self-righteous people will go to justify their hate.The Leader...We spend a lot of time in the perspective of Mike Robson, once an officer of the law, now the leader of the team that goes into the thick of zombie territory to find supplies and survivors. Mike was the perfect hero. Loyal to a fault, caring but strict when needed, and a strong sense of morals. He is the kind of guy you would want to follow. I knew with him leading the group, with him being the voice of reason that no matter how bad things got, he would find a way to help the others survive.Angels of Death...Natalie was another great character. She was the leader of the Angels of Death, a group of girls who she taught to shoot a gun and take care of themselves. The stories of what these girls had to go through to survive were gut-wrenching. The many rape gangs roving the world has made zombie-land even more terrifying for the female population. Natalie showed these women who have been victimized to fight and survive. I love reading about women who don't let their horrible pasts dictate who they are now. It added a lot of emotion to the novel that made me feel for the characters even more.Zombies vs. Vampires...I loved the added twist of vampires amongst the Zombie Apocalypse. I really felt bad for them though. Their brethren had pretty much started the end of the world by releasing this virus on the population. Too bad for the vampires that they were not immune to the virus either. Now there are only a few vamps left in the world and almost every human would relish wiping them out. The vampires aren't too keen on having to rely on humans to survive. They need someone to watch over them during the daylight hours. This vulnerability only strengthens the vampires' hatred for the humans that wish them dead. Dravko was the secondary leader of the small vamp group, and he did a great job of keeping them safe. He remained logical the whole time, never letting his emotions get the best of him. He knew who was a threat to his team, and which humans he could trust. I like how some of the humans and vamps started to work together as a common threat emerged.Humanity is Gone...The themes in this book were thought-provoking: How human frailty can destroy communities. How disaster rarely brings people together, but dismantles the basic structure  of humanity. How morals and chivalry are often set aside as each person fights for their own life. How to some people hate and revenge are worth more than the rebuilding of a thriving society. I don't think anyone could really say what kind of person they will become if put in this kind of situation, but we can only hope we keep at least a thread of compassion and civilty even during the end of the world.Can't We All Just Get Along?It was so easy for the people in Rotter World to blame the vampires for the destruction of life on Earth, but hate is what will continue the road of complete human elimination. When we are met with despair and a bleak future, one can only try to make things better by working together, not against one another. In Rotter World, some people just couldn't let go of their disdain and distrust and it got them killed. It also got innocents killed along the way. But Rotter World also showed us that there is always hope for humanity. Even when surviving seems impossible, there is always light at the end of the tunnel. People make mistakes but holding that against them and continuing a feud during a larger war is just counterproductive. I loved reading about a group that comes together to overcome the impossible. It made me want to cheer out loud.Zombie Apocalypse...Rotter World was gory, terrifying, and heart-wrenching. It took my breath away and made me shiver at the same time. The action was sublime and the pacing kept my attention till the last page. I couldn't put this book down. There was a constant sense of dread the whole way through. I wanted so bad for everyone to survive, but that kind of wishful thinking is useless with a zombie book. People die, we mourn, and then move on. Because after killing the first fifty zombies, a hundred take their place. The Zombie Apocalypse waits for no man...or vampire.The BadOnly two things bothered me. The beginning (after the initial zombie scene) was pretty slow but it was understandable since Baker had to introduce us to all his characters. Then there was a bit of a lull about three fourths into the book, when the crew finally gets to the underground facility.The SnugglyWe get some fun sexual tension and sex scenes. Yaaay. I like my zombie books with at least one sex scene. What the hell else are these people to do when they might be eaten any second?OverallThis is the kind of zombie book I have been looking for. Nothing was held back. I was face deep in rotting skin and gooey innards as Baker took me on the ride of my life. I loved the characters, even the bad guys. They all contributed to producing one hell of a zombie story. Highly recommended to all.Excerpt"What's in there?" Sam asked nervously."Trust me," said Natalie, "you don't want to know.""We'll see." Sam yanked Natalie off the truck, knocking her into the grass. He stepped back and spoke to the others. "Check it out. If you find anyone inside, kill'em."The three gunmen climbed up onto the loading dock. The lanky one pushed aside the curtains with his AK-47 to allow the mustachioed gunman and the one in the Harley Davidson vest to enter, and then followed them inside.A moment later, a scream emanated from the back of the Ryder, followed by gun shots and a growl, an ungodly guttural sound that was neither animal nor human. All three men started screaming now, the intensity of their panic terrifying. Then, one by one, each cry devolved into a muffled gurgle. The mayhem stopped as quickly as it had started, leaving in it's place an eerie silence.

$review_text.: Another good entry in Nicola Claire's Sweet Seduction series. This one focuses on Nick (brother to Dominic from book 1) and Eva, who is a country music singer living in Nashville but visiting New Zealand to take care of her dying father. Nick and Eva had a previous one-night stand eight years before the book starts, and both were deeply affected at the time and are still pining for each other even after all these years.Eva has been abused by her cousins since she was young, and Nick (and the hot rush guys from ASI, his investigation agency) are watching out for her to protect her from her cousins and aunt. Her family sucks!Will Eva and Nick get back together? Yes, for now for some hot and heavy sexual tension and sex. Will Eva leave Nashville and return to New Zealand and Nick? That's what the story is basically about.I liked the first book a bit better than this one (and the third one which I finished a day after this one a whole lot better than this one). But it's good to read this one because it introduces a lot of the male and female characters who will make up the series that follows.

$review_text.: I will preface my review by stating, in all caps, if you haven't read "Everlong", READ IT NOW! (Before you read this book). Not only is it a fantastic read, Evermine's society/structure/the demon races/etc will make a whole lot more sense.  ^_^ I was also pleased that we had a bit more character and environment description in this book versus Everlong. Yay!However, I was a tiny bit disappointed in a few of the things that happened to some of the main characters in "Everlong" (ie, the Harper & Maddie drama), but while I was disappointed, this book helped me to understand that things truly did end up the way they should have. Evermine picks up with immediate action, sending Harper, and Emma, back to Askara for new positions in a new government system established by Madalyn's sister who has ascended the throne. The new system works to maintain equality among the various demon races of Askara and abolishes slavery, which does not go over well for some of the uppercrust in Askaran Demonic Society.While in the midst of spies, intrigue, and slave drama, Harper and Emmahave listened to their calls to duty and honor over their hearts desires for all of their lives, and in Evermine they are forced to deal with their commitment issues to each other, resulting in, of course, lots of pent up demon sex!Altogether, this is not a run of the mill paranormal romance. The mystery, the plotss and subplots are intricately woven into the romantic world between the demon couples- the entire series is thus far amazing and keeps page after page flipping by.  Please keep them coming, Ms. Edwards, and I cannot wait to see what lies in store for the Askaran Demons in Eversworn! ^_^

I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the fact that the characters I'd loved so much in Lick were not under the spotlight, but I needn't have worried because Anne and Mal were awesome. Ms Scott draws characters so well and so thoroughly that you feel you know them inside out and you're ready to laugh and cry with them. Mal is hyperactive and you can just see and feel the energy coming off him. The author sure knows how to write a book and her sense of humour is epic. I was sad when the book ended. I didn't want it to end, damn you, Kylie lol. I can't wait until the next one comes out. If you haven't read Lick or Play, what are you waiting for? Do it!

$review_text.: Sometimes the love we've always wanted is the one we've always had.Ginny Marshal was about to have her dreams realized: a lucrative recording contract, growing fame, and a relationship with one of People Magazine's most eligible bachelors, and yet something was holding her back. Ginny had to figure out what to do, and she could only think of one person who could help - her former fiance, Brett Miller. She hops on a plane to Glacier Bay, Alaska, looking for answers, but she found so much more.When Miller's grandmother hands Ginny a stack of old letters, she is drawn into the story of Clay, an early missionary to Alaska, and Ellie, who came to serve as a governess to his children after the death of his wife.Far from the smog and traffic in LA, Ginny rediscovers the beauty of God's creation in Glacier Bay, Alaska, and learns that sometimes love finds you where you least expect it.I love a good romance, and the nice thing about Love Finds You (LFY) in Glacier Bay is that you actually get to enjoy two love stories in one. I really enjoyed reading Ellie's story, told in letter form. Just like Ginny, I was desperate to find out what happened next. I had a hard time putting the book down.I enjoyed learning about the rich history of Alaska's early settlers. Through the letters and journal entries, I felt like I got a small glimpse of what life might have been like for those living in the Alaskan frontier.I've never been to Alaska, but after reading this book, I want to hop on a plane and check out Glacier Bay for myself. It sounds like it's absolutely breathtaking.I also appreciated the elements of faith woven into the story. Sometimes I feel like some authors of Christian fiction dump the gospel into a story in ways that feel unnatural or forced, but in LFY in Glacier Bay, the story is seasoned with grace - the characters aren't the picture of saintly perfection, they are human beings with flaws and a history. I love redemption stories, and that's what this one is. It's a great reminder that God's plans and purposes may not always work out the way we have planned, but they are always for our ultimate good.DISCLOSURE: I received a complimentary copy of the book to facilitate the review. I was not obligated to give a positive endorsement. The thoughts expressed in the review are my honest thoughts of the novel.

$REVIEW.: The year is 1772, and Toma Nicolescu and his friend Alec Cardei have seen their fair share of battles while serving the empress of Russia, Catherine the Great. So when they are dispatched to Moldavia to protect the Cantemir family, a very influential family in Moldavia, until the empress could appoint a ruler for that country who would be loyal to Catherine the Great, they think it will be an easy job.The Cantemir family consisted of Kesia and her twin daughters Lucine and Natasha. Both girls had been taught by their mothers to live as free spirits and basically do whatever felt good, but an unplanned pregnancy and the loss of a baby when Lucine was seventeen had sort of tempered her ways, but not Natasha, she basically is always looking for a good time. Alec known as a ladies man was immediately lusting after Natasha, and while Toma was warned by the empress not to become romantically involved,becomes drawn to Lucine, but keeps his feelings at bay until he feels that Lucine is being threatened by Vlad Van Valerik.When Toma  realizes is that Vlad and his entourage aren't what they seem, he knows he will do whatever it takes to save the woman he loves, no matter the cost.I found this book to be very thought provoking, where the characters feelings are so real that you can feel the anguish that Toma felt as well as the evil emitting from Vlad. I really enjoyed how Mr. Dekker tied Vlad's history to the book of Genesis, I only wish he would have traced his history to Lilith instead of the Nephilim.This isn't a clear cut christian novel but instead has so many more elements, it has that horror story element of blood drinking vampires, but it also reminds us of God's unconditional love for us, and how it took the blood of our Savior to save us all!An amazing read, that I won't soon forget.This is my first opportunity to read anything written by Mr. Dekker and I am now his newest fan!

$review_text.: In Pope John Paul II's apostolic letter "At the Beginning of the Third Millennium", he called for a `new evangelization'. This evangelization was to breathe fresh life and a renewed spirit into the world, particularly to those peoples who were once Christian but who had drifted from faith.One facet of the Pope's call was a revival of apologetics, the defense and explanation of Church teaching. In the third millennium, the advent of the Internet opened the door for this apologetical revolution. Writings from church fathers and Saints were introduced online. Quality explanations of Church teaching could be found by anyone accessing a search engine. And professional apologists, authors, and teachers began springing up across the world.In light of this surging interest in apologetics, Mark Brumley, now the President of Ignatius Press, wrote a book titled "How Not to Share Your Faith". The book wasn't written to provide specific apologetical arguments but instead focuses on the dangers apologists face.Brumley calls these dangers the Seven Deadly Sins of Apologetics:1. Apologetical Gluttony - A failure to respect the limits of what apologetics can accomplish.2. Reducing the Faith to Apologetics - Looking at all or most spiritual matters "apologetically".3. Confusing the Faith with Our Arguments for It - Reducing the Faith to our own particular arguments for it4. Contentiousness - Going out of your way to look for areas of disagreement.5. Friendly Fire -Battling Protestants and other absolutists instead of non-Christians and relativists.6. Trying to "Win" - Aiming to 'win' an argument, even at the expense of bringing people to truth.7. Pride - Thinking more highly of one's apologetical abilities than one should.Like all Church teaching, though, Brumley's admonitions are not fundamentally No's. He offers corresponding Yes's for each No, Virtues for each Deadly Sin. For instance, while denouncing the reduction of faith to apologetics, Brumley encourages prayer and meditation. Instead of trying to "win" arguments, Brumley advocates hope and charity, among other apologetical virtues."How Not to Share Your Faith" teaches everyone who shares their faith to do so charitably. Every Christian will find this book somewhat applicable because every Christian talks about faith to some degree. However, Brumley's book holds special importance for those explaining or defending the Catholic faith on a regular basis, either as an amateur apologist or a professional.Anyone who discusses faith issues through blogs or comment box discussions would do well to consider Brumley's advice. This book should be required reading for all Catholics on the Internet.Participating in the "new evangelization" requires that we communicate the 'good news' of Christ with humility and compassion. Presenting truth without these virtues makes us nothing more than a resounding gong. If you know the content of the faith but want to communicate it more charitably, I highly recommend "How Not to Share Your Faith".

$REVIEW.: Clever and highly imaginative. My favorites were probably "Cup and Table" and "Dream Engine". Bonus points for a story titled "Romanticore". I'll certainly be reading more from Tim Pratt. One reason I almost gave the book four stars (but went with five in the end) is because I expect even better from Pratt in the future.

$REVIEW.: If you follow the Lusty, Tx series then this is the must have book for you.  It tells the love affair/story of Grandma Kate whom we all have come to know and love. She is responsible for most of the relationships/marriages in the Lusty series.  I swear I think this series gets better and better with each book.  I highly enjoyed it and think that it should be a 10 but amazon only has 5 stars.  Anyone who is a true fan of the series must have this book.This is how the relationship between Grandma Kate (who was Major Kate Wesley) and Major Gerald and Major Patrick Benedict and shows how the originial women Sarah and Amanda started the match making tradition.When I read the series again (which I will do of course) then I would recommend reading as follows :Love under two gunslingersLove under two lawmenA lusty Christmas (even though she is telling the grandchildren the story)Book 1: Love Under Two BenedictsBook 2: Love Under Two WildcattersBook 3: Love Under Two HonchosBook 4: Love Under Two FlyboysBook 5: Love Under Two Strong MenBook 6: Love Under Two Navy SEALsBook 7: Love Under Two KendallsBook 8: Love Under Three TitansBook 9: Love Under Two DoctorsBook 10: Love Under Two Cowboys

$REVIEW.: Cosmetology has been around for centuries. Women and men alike flock to the hair salon for a variety of treatments. Is it any wonder that more and more people are looking to start up their own salon? For those with the expertise of the basics, this book is a great starting point for learning the ins and outs of business ownership. Essentially, a license will be needed for those operating in the salon but this book explores the strictly business side. If you&#8217;re not licensed it&#8217;s a great look into this lucrative business, explaining the ins and outs of salon life from hair processes, to nail care, and into the Day Spa aspect. This book looks at what each process is and how to capitalize on the variety of services offered and keep cliental satisfied.

$REVIEW.: This book had been on my radar for about a year but I had resisted buying it...mainly because of the EMP story arc. I have read many post apocalyptic books that use EMP as a basis for a collapse and everything that I have read says that an EMP cant be as selective as portayed In this book and that's what stopped me buying it.....until now.I finally decided that this was an author that basically wanted to tell a story around the old battleships being brought back to life to help defeat a North Korea who finally thought they had found a way to win a new Korean war...and that's what finally got me to overcome my issues surrounding the EMP issues as that's a story that really appealed to me and also at over 500 pages boy was I getting my moneys worth.Thankfully the EMP arc of the story does not last long and then you are into the story and its GREAT!!. Adversity brings out the best or worse in people and you see people who were struggling in their lives prior to the attack step up when its needed, its nice to have a good leader (the president) in this book, hes one we would all like to have in real life.If you enjoy a story about great men...and women with plenty of naval action (lncluding crossing the T like Nelson did) and a retaking of Korea to boot then you will enjoy this book, as long as you can get over any EMP issues like I eventually did!!!Well recommended.Phil

At slightly less than 300 pages, it is terse but it covers a multitude of variations and tank equipment including the ever popular Goliath Sd Kfz 302 and 303 variations.  There are pictures aplenty and useful appendices covering, among other things, the major weapons carried by these tanks.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because I thought it could have used more operational information on the different vehicles.  All in all though, for an inexpensive one volume source book on German AFVs, I have not met its equal.

The entire series is amazing (book #2 is "Lions of the Desert" and book #3 is "Valiant Hearts"), and I love the way Linda mixes romance with history and mystery. The chemistry between the two main characters simply jumps off the page and the plot is so interesting that it'll have you reading all night to find out what happens! A must-have for anyone who enjoys Christian romance, historical fiction, or mystery.The first book is set in the months before World War I, in Egypt, where nurse Allison Wescott finds herself caught up in a world of murder and espionage, not to mention romance, as she's caught between two loves (her fiance and a mysterious British officer).

I won't bore you with a long drawn out review of everything in the book, but here are some of the highlights:"Aftermath" by Karen Black - what an ending!  I was surprised and impressed by the twist taken in this story of the aftermath of a house fire.the poems by Jennifer J. Arend were delightfully morose and perfectly suited for reading on Halloween!"David and the Outside" by Robert L. Arend -- this story took a more sci-fi take on the horror genre but I loved that!  I don't want to say too much, but this is one of the must reads of the book."Candle in the Darkness" by Karen Black -- this ghost story has a sweet twist that choked me up a little.  I think this was my favorite story in the entire book.

$review_text.: The new e-book "31 Days to Clean" by Sarah Mae has really been generating a lot of positive buzz lately! Have you heard of it yet? You really must see this book for yourself! This time, the hype is well deserved! Seriously, Sarah Mae has done a fabulous job with this book.The title of this book, "31 Days to Clean," would suggest that this is just another self-help housecleaning book

Actually this book is much more


Yes, this book does contain housecleaning hints and scheduling, but really this book is broken down into 31 daily devotional studies

Think of a messy house and then try to decide if the messiness is a hands-to-work issue or if the messiness reflects an unhealthy attitude towards ourselves and our family.Each entry for each of the 31 Days is short, usually only 1-2 pages
Each day includes a heart-to--heart devotional lesson designed to stop the negative thoughts that many moms falsely believe to be true
Then after the devotional portion are two assignments, both based on the sisters Mary and Martha in the Bible

In case you aren't familiar with Mary and Martha, one day Jesus went to visit the sisters
Mary sat down with Jesus and filled her time with love and worship of him

Sister Martha ran to the kitchen to bake and entertain


Shortly, Martha really becomes angry with her sister Mary and eventually calls her out in front of Jesus
Jesus corrects Martha saying that both sisters are right as they both should rest and love others, as well as being concerned for the wellbeing of others.In the e-book "31 Days to Clean" for each of the 31 days, Sarah Mae gives the readers a Mary assignment and a Martha assignment
Typically a Mary assignment focuses on goals and basically implementing a household system that works for your family
The Martha assignments are specific cleaning assignments

By following the Martha assignments daily, in the end of the month the major portions of your house should be clean.Without being preachy, Sarah Mae has written an e-book that can meet all women right where they are at


Neat freaks might benefit more from the Mary "heart" lessons
Messy moms might benefit from the Martha cleaning tips
Check out "31 Days to Clean" by Sarah Mae

It's easy, it's workable and it's important.

$REVIEW.: I've been following "The Walking Dead" since the first trade paperback
 I'm so devoted to this series that I bought a newly released collection while on vacation in Sweden a couple years ago because I couldn't wait to catch up


 I wasn't sure what direction Mr
Kirkman would take after the last collection's apocalyptic final page, but he has certainly gone to the dark side with this volume

 That man has *no* mercy


 Wow.In a flashback we see The Governor, body horribly maimed by Michonne but hateful soul intact, marshalling his forces against Rick's enclave using blatant lies and force of will
Suffice to say that he's more twisted now than ever, especially given the depths he's sunk to in his relationship with the little girl zombie he keeps leashed up at home

 Between her and his "entertainment system," we see that he's more comfortable relating with the undead than with the living.After we return to his assault on the prison, things get even nastier

 No quarter is asked, and none given
 Familiar characters are brutally murdered, badly wounded, spiritually broken, or flee for their lives
 What makes this volume so devastating is that many longtime players are lost or forever damaged, even some that have been around since day one

 And of course, the undead feast on anyone unlucky enough to get in their way (talk about survival of the fittest)

 As with most zombie stories, the undead aren't really the villains


 Indeed, the living are more gruesome and do the most heinous deeds by far.In the end, we have yet another of Mr

Kirkman's trademark cliffhangers, one that tops all the previous ones in its horror and desolation


 I don't know what Mr


Kirkman snorts while writing these stories, but it must be some hardcore stuff
 Absolutely recommended - but not for kids or the faint of heart.

$REVIEW.: This book is like The Perfect Storm:  no one knows for sure what happened at the end because no one was there--at least no Europeans.  (A better analogy might be the Mahler 10th symphony as completed by Cooke;  sketches existed but they needed to organized and filled in.) So if you like your history backed up by solid evidence (with no accomodation for "what ifs" and "maybes") at every turn, this book is not for you.Others have criticized Chelmsford's mistakes and those of other participants, but where Snook's book really fills a void is his analysis of the last stand of the companies of the 24th.  I found his version of events completely plausible and compelling;  he just has to be basically right.  He does go a bit overboard, so that the story is told at the spear-jabbing, bayonet-thrusting level, but he turns out to be such a great action writer that he carries the reader along with him.  Even if you keep asking yourself:  how does he really know that?--it doesn't matter.  The book is a masterpiece of reconstruction.  If you know that going in, you will appreciate Snook's work as a long-overdue tribute to the 24th regiment and the men who died at Isandlwana.

$REVIEW.: An entertaining little read with an endearing protagonist. This read was just sheer enjoyment. Ellis used a cute little pop quiz device to begin each chapter that actually proved really integral to the story. I also liked Kylie's line of work--she was interested in Fashion Design and I enjoyed the insights this book afforded into that industry. I gave it four stars because the middle was a little soggy. A little too much time spent adulating each other. A little too much telling instead of showing. Kylie, the viewpoint character, told us at least 20 times how sexy Harrison looked. I guess I am in favor of painting the picture and letting the reader draw her own conclusions. One warning for other readers--Ellis employs gratuitous use of the f-bomb. If that is a sticking point with you, you may not enjoy this read. But overall, lots of fun, and capably and imaginatively written, too.

$review_text.: Probably the most common framing job a homeowner is likely to tackle is an unfinished basement but there is nothing for them here

 Chapter 14 covers basement framing with steel - not lumber!  For a lot of homers that makes this book a big fat zero
 As for the rest of it, I'm not sure this book is suitable for anyone
 Half the book is written for someone whose almost ready for their contractors license and the other half is written for someone who has never picked up a hammer

 It really feels like it was written by more than one person


 The switch occurs suddenly and is jarring, confusing, and annoying
 The first chapter covers extremely basic stuff most DIY guys already know (e.g., what is pressure treated lumber, common lumber dimensions, etc.)
 Then chapter 2 gets technical (e.g., glossaries of blueprint abbreviations and symbols and discussions of engineering stuff like sheer forces and live loads, etc.)


The next two chapters get extremely basic again, describing tools you'll need in  detail (nearly an entire page devoted to framing hammers) and a few chapters later you are into gabled roofs and shed dormers


 The book aspires to provide all the engineering and construction knowledge you need to frame a Victorian house from professional architectural drawings by someone who has never actually held a screwdriver before

 Ridiculous.

$review_text.: This short story did a better job exploring various characters than some full novels. Bell took a short story and created a world where a young man learns about true love after a life of self-bigotry and sexual mischief/deceit. Some reviewers hated Joey but I didn't. He has unlike able characteristics but everyone has something unlike able about them and this only expands his character as he changes and witnesses love and decides to seek it out himself. At first he has no interest in love but he is still out and proud and has a lot of confidence. Bradley and Scott are good characters and the evolution as a result of Joey is touching and entertaining. Philip  is so sweet and innocent and the change he brings about in Joey is very profound. Maggie while seemingly a minor character plays a big role in backing up Joey and giving smart advice. The manicurist quick suggestion was hilarious and though in the story for seconds gave an unforgettable line. Joey's mom also plays her role though I think her continuous flow of partners and the divorce might have played a part in him not being interested in love.Bell you wrote a masterpiece and then decided to reward readers by making it free. Excellent work, this is what I want to read in my gay fiction. An amazing story.

$REVIEW.: Where do I begin? This story really got to me. The loss, the love, the struggles.This was a beautifully penned beginning to what I can only imagine will be an outstanding trilogy.Sara Mack creates a vivid world filled with love, loss and the void one feels in their struggle to move forward. Emma Donohue has experienced a world of pain. Her world is shattered when she loses the only man she's ever loved, James.He is her rock, her life, her love...until he's gone. But is their love greater than even death?James loves Emma -- "until the end of forever." After he tragically dies, Emma relives many of their memories. Oftentimes, she hears James' voice but somehow it comforts her. She wishes for more of those moments and when they come, she clings to them with every fiber of her being. She wants more than anything to be with him again...Enter Dane, handsome, rich and available....oh right, and not so dead. Emma and Dane grow close and their friendship reaches a crossroads when Dane risks his heart in hopes that Emma is ready to take a leap with him. Even after all she's been through, he sticks by her and patiently waits hoping she'll let him in as more than a friend.Although James is dead, Emma battles with her feelings and the guilt eats away at her.My issue with this book... plain and simple...IT ENDED!It ended and my jaw dropped.Seriously Sara Mack is evil! She builds up this fabulous story only to leave you in utter suspense!Yeah Sara, I said it! LOLI was left wondering what in the hell will I do until Allegiant releases????!!!!I fell in love with James, Dane and Emma. Emma will have quite a few decisions to make and I suspect this is just the beginning! I can't even decide which guy I love more and that worries me because this trilogy could go either way and I don't know that I could ever hate either of the paths! I am seriously stuck trying to figure out which team to root for! Hopefully Allegiant reveals some of my suspicions.I HIGHLY recommend this book for any New Adult/Paranormal Romance fan. It is an absolutely beautiful story and will have you hooked.

$REVIEW.: OMG!!! WOW!! JUST TOTALLY AMAZING!!  Just when you think you can't fall in love with Linc and Dault anymore than you did with book one you definately can.  T.H. Snyder did a wonderful job with book two and continuing the story of these two men who have been friends since they were kids.  This story is based more on Dault and Etty.  Dault faces his past and also gets hooked on Etty and can't believe that there is only one woman for him. Does he go for her or doesn't he?  So many challenges and pasts haunting him and Etty's past comes back which really puts Dault through the test. A CLIFFHANGER?? OF COURSE  T.H. Snyder wouldn't have it any other way.  Just like a cliffhanger in Cursed Love she really gives us a big one here.  I look forward to book 3 to see what happens to Linc,Dault and the rest of the crew.  Also T.H.Snyder has two amazing covermodels.

$review_text.: This book is well worth it


 First, the book gives an excellent run down on the evolution of the RPG system
 The Soviets designed the RPG after being inspired by the very good Panzerfaust and Panzershriek series of weapons
 The Panzerfaust Klein was the template for the 1st series of the RPG
 Note, the Russian design was superior to the Panzerfaust and it was quite informative to read about this.Second, the author breaks down the RPGs into the various families and provides the reader with an easy to follow evolution of the weapons system

 Of particular note to this reviewer was an explanation that the B-40 rockets used for area bombardment, like in Vietnam, was part of the RPG family of weapons
 I distinctly can remember my old USAF crew chief talking of Da Nang and the rocket attacks, never dreamed he was under an RPG attack, but those attacks were quite effective


 It was not uncommon for the military to lose a jet or two in the attacks

 That's quite a payoff for a disposable weapon system.The author explains the use of the weapon, individual training, tactics, and employment of the weapon

 Also, there are very nice pages of the various warheads


 Some of this is so good that a good Marine or Army Infantry Officer or Sergeant might want to pick this book up and give it a read


 A G.I

will face this weapon on the battlefield.While every 3rd rate Army in the world gets the excellent RPG it should be noted that the USA may never really get a copy of the weapon
 Oh, we make copies of it and the author shows a picture

 We give those to various 3rd world allies
 But the US military will never be given a copy of the RPG
 Indeed, the Viper and various other "plastic" Bazooka inspired weapons are heavier and less effective than the RPG
 Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery

 The USA does not want to compliment Russian innovation and American soldiers die

 It's shameful.So, I really liked this book
 One learns all about the RPG, it's family, and it's many warheads


 It's a fairly small book, at a little more than 60 odd pages and can be studied quite well in about an hour.

$review_text.: The following review is my opinion and not a paid review. I was received a free copy of the book from the author for my honest opinion.In book one Ultimatum of The Devil's Kiss Kayla steals money from her boss and he finds out. Instead of calling the police he decides to blackmail her. Her boss Cage draws up a contract between him and Kayla. The contract states that Kayla will be his slave in the true essence of the word. What does Kayla get out of this besides staying out of prison? What would make a woman give up all her rights to one man? Her three year old little girl thats what. Cage offers to pay for all of her daughter Eve's medical bills and keep Kayla out of jail and she becomes his slave, his sex slave.In book two Enslaved all Kayla is thinking and cares about is that her daughter is getting the treatment she needs thanks to Cage. It doesn't matter that she is Cage's slave and not only does she have to the weekends at his house and not at the hospital with her daughter. The only important thing is that Eve is getting her treatments. Cage not only tells her what to do at his house he has control over Kayla at the office the hospital or wherever she maybe by telling her what to wear, what to eat and who she can and can't talk too.In book three Retribution of The Devil's Kiss Kayla finds out some info that just may turn the tables on old Cage. Kayla finds out that Cage has more skeletons in his closet than just enjoying being in control when it comes to how he enjoys his sex life like a little BDSM if you know what I mean. Cage is a very cruel man and just may have been picked right out of the devil's rear end. But he never actually forced Kayla to do anything she didn't want to do. She always had a choice no matter what that choice was. She did have two choices. 1. Go to prison. 2. Let her daughter die. What mother would not have made the same choice as Kayla? A good mother would have done the very exact same thing.Retribution is a very good story and I did like all the characters yes even Cage in his own way. I will give you fair warning there is a lot of sex like BDSM. So if you are not into this kind of story or if you are under 18 then maybe you shouldn't read Retribution. If you do decide that The Devil's Kiss is something you would like to read then I do suggest that you read them in order starting with Ultimatum book #1 and then Enslaved book #2 and finally Retribution book #3.

$review_text.: This is a very engrossing narrative that is informative, sobering, and chilling


 The book reflects the author's own reporting over many years on the aggressive Murdoch news/entertainment empire as well as research done specifically for the book

 It has an extensive bibliography and has meticulously annotated page notes documenting sources that occupy about a fourth of the entire book


 There is also a detailed index that works with the Kindle.This reader was aware of some of the excesses of the news media of Murdoch's empire, both in the US and the UK

 However he did appreciate the depth of the depravity that is documented in detail by this book for activities in the UK that ultimately resulted in the closing of News of the World in England, after 168 years of publishing.* Widespread hacking of telephone voicemail boxes (thousands) to gain tidbits for publishing
 The targets ranged from royalty like Prince Charles, close relatives of former prime ministers, MPs, celebrities like Hugh Grant, to more ordinary people: people who had been killed in the 2005 bus and subway bombings, British soldiers killed in Afghanistan or Iraq, and during the police hunt the phone 13 year old girl who had been murdered.* Scotland Yard kept and ignored extensive documentation of hacking activity.* Bribing the police to gain confidential information on people's whereabouts or phone numbers to hack.* Blackmailing a person into giving interviews.* Following MP members of investigative committees by private investigators who were looking for dirt.* Tit-for-tat or undue influence with politicians at the highest levels of the UK government.Unsavory activities in the US had some surprises, but they are not on the scale of what happened in the UK.* Setting up a journalist they did not like with a false "tip".* Planting numerous phony "reviews" or comments by their own employees against people or organizations they did not like.* Claims that Obama had studied at a Wahhabist madrassa and that was not bone in the US.* Large political contributions in 2010 elections blur line between balanced news coverage and political advocacy.* Pressuring Romney to choose Ryan as his running mate in 2012.* Pressuring Christie to support Romney.There is an interesting and generally favorable discussion of the Wall Street Journal's delicate situation and its actions of preserving its reputation for independence after being taken over by Murdoch.There is no formal epilogue, but much of the last chapter serves that role:One of the ironies is a description of some consequences of journalism run amok, but which do not come immediately to mind while reading the book as a whole:  A bedrock of both British and US American culture is a free press
 That freedom allowed Murdoch's empire grow and flourish


 However, once the astounding excesses of that empire become known, pressures can arise to deal with the abuse with the heavy hand of law, compromising that bedrock for everyone
 This realization reinforces the need to understand that a free press must also be responsible to considerations above monetary gains or advantages of influence.This message is coupled with the admonition that we as a people share in the responsibility for the abuses:"Murdoch similarly could not have accumulated his fortunes without our help

We are all, as consumers of media, involved and even responsible for the creation of Murdoch's World ---those of us who pick up his tabloids at the newsstand, enjoy the cable news wars, subscribe to his prestigious papers, watch a ballgame on TV, buy tickets to a movie, even those of us who are News Corp investors through pension funds or mutual funds

We make up the market that he sought to create and feed


He played us, as much as he played everyone else


And we have rewarded him handsomely for it."This statement appearing near the end of the book reflects on Murdoch's attitude expressed early in the book
 In a curious twist of word meanings, Murdoch said that what he did was in the public interest, because people are interested in reading it.There is an interesting change of mood in the denouement


 Up to this point, there has been an edge on the narrative, which was a necessary consequence of the nature of the tawdry events that were described


 Here, however, there is a gentleness that visits the pages, exhibiting some empathy for many of the characters, including Rupert Murdoch himself


 This whole story is not unlike a Greek tragedy in which the fatal flaws of the principals eventually take their toll.This book is an extraordinarily fine piece of work.On a technical note, the extensive page notes of the book are difficult to use in the Kindle format, because of the necessity to jump back and forth

 In fact, one does not even know when to jump while reading the main text, because the page notes are organized around page numbers that are irrelevant in the Kindle format


 This is a situation for which the hard copy is much better suited


 However, in the Kindle format, having once read the book, one can just start reading the page notes and use the links to the appropriate text, and use the Back button to return to the page notes
 Alternatively, one can do this on a chapter by chapter basis while reading.There are so many different characters and branches of the Murdoch empire that it is a little difficult to keep track of them all during the reading

 A table of the people, the business, and their connections would have been useful
 A serious reader might be like to assemble such a table as the reading proceeds.

$REVIEW.: I have just read this marvelous book and I can't stop thinking about the people and places I saw, through the eyes of the author, that I had never seen in just that way before.It so happens that I know the author (but I never knew ANY of THIS!).  When I met her I immediately admired her -- but I never knew why.  I mean, other than the obvious, which she did not stress in her book but which I can personally attest to -- how SMART she is -- which is quite obvious in the book.Aleshia tells us how, at her dear mother Mozelle's urging, she went to college (which is where we met!).  She dashes off her college degree while battling husband and health problems, and it's the latter two that she finds taxing.  She breezes through her practice teaching, making it all look easy (and it WAS NOT EASY).  Apparently she often made things look easy that cost her a lot.Later she gets mad because some snotty actor &quot;one-ups&quot; her with his Master's degree.  Just to &quot;show him,&quot; she goes and gets herself a Master's too!  So there!  You see, my dear Aleshia, not everybody is capable of doing that, only people who are smart, literate and know how to learn.  That's a quality so prevalent in the book.  Young people should read this to see how a smart person survives in a hostile world, indeed a lesson for us all.People on campus who knew I knew Aleshia would sometimes crassly ask me if I had heard that &quot;she&quot; was on sports teams as a boy back in high school.  My answer was heartfelt.  &quot;I don't know, but I do know that she's more of a woman than I'll ever be.&quot;  It was true.  She admits in her book, she was a slave to the times of Jackie, Marilyn and a woman cleaving to a man not only for food and shelter but also her identity.  This &quot;pre-feminist&quot; era is difficult to explain to anyone who wasn't there, but Aleshia does a very fine job.So yes, I have always admired Aleshia, and I really admire this book.  As someone who has known her (off and on) since college, I will tell you that this book is just like sitting down with her on a cozy evening and saying, &quot;So, you castrated yourself, huh?,&quot; and she takes it from there, an honest, earnest, touching and amusing story of sexual (genetic?) confusion.Finally, I look at the picture of &quot;Buddy.&quot;  I look in &quot;his&quot; eyes and I see the Aleshia I know.  It's ALESHIA.  I don't have the words, but it is the soul, the essence of &quot;buddy/aleshia,&quot; one person... Anyway, whether man, woman, boy or girl... SHE IS.  Thank God for that!P.Murphy(Fellow Speech &amp; Theater Major at MTSU, now a writer in Hollywood)

Cole is a hot alpha bad ass biker. The connection they had from the start was awesome and hot as hell! They way Cole took control and told her not to fight the feeling she has, loved it. I loved the way the bikers fight for family and how Cole did what he had to to keep Maddie safe.I can go on and on but I would give away the whole book!!Awesome book!!!

 Thoroughly enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot


 Fiction, but very realistic - including moles and counter-moles


 The ending is suspenseful and exciting
 There is one graphic shooting, that I didn't think was necessaary or really added anything to the image
 The reader will immediately know which one I'm referring to.Will definitely read more Trevor Scott - "Tony Caruso" mysteries

$REVIEW.: This book provides rough outlines of trips in various locations throughout New England broken down into: Must do trips, trips on well known roads, the offbeat trip, nature trips ( of which there are only 4), food & wine trips, historic trips, urban trips, and 5 side trips from cities

The book plays at giving you deeper info, like go to this restaurant in this town

Get the wood grilled pizza

But let's be honest, that's not really that helpful and doesn't give you a good overview of what's available or special

If you fancy the sound of one of their planned trips you still really need to go online to find out the details of what your going to experience.Whale watching, a popular past time that Mid-Atlantic types swarm up to New England to experience is mentioned as a blurb I the Coastal New England must do trip in a 7 day, 750 mile route


All of the lighthouses covered in the Historic trips section entitled 69 Lighthouses in 60 hours are located in Maine in a 375 route

I would argue that trip would be both exhausting and perhaps a little limiting as it kind of implies that there are no other lighthouses in the other states.

There's a lot of information in here on a wide variety of topics. I like to think of myself as a contrarian when it comes to environmental issues, but this book challenged even me. I will be spending a long time thinking about this book and how it is going to affect me.I don't agree with everything he says, but if you care at all about the environment you owe it to yourself and the environment to at least read this book and think about it.

$REVIEW.: I wasn't sure if I was going to like Romulus Buckle & the City of the Founders.  I actually had to look up what steampunk was as a genre.  But, since I was in the mood for something completely different, I decided to give it a shot.  Keep in mind that, this being my first steampunk read, I have no basis of comparison to similar works.  I can only say that I enjoyed the book for what it was - a swashbuckling adventure set in a wintery world without electricity and decimated by an alien attack.What I enjoyed most was the ability of Preston to vividly create a dystopian future world.  I also liked the way he introduced main characters one chapter at a time while doling out bits of history here and there to keep things interesting.The only thing keeping the book from being 5 stars for me is that it didn't give enough back stories - both for the characters and for the situation of humanity in general.  I realize the book is the first in a series, and it leaves plenty hanging in the balance at the end to support more storytelling, but I would like to know more about why the world is the way it is for Romulus Buckle and crew.On a side note, I would not seek out this book for anything other than a Pirate of the Caribbean type of adventure.  Don't come here expecting much more than action and adventure.

$review_text.: Borjesson and her colleagues detail what it's like to have an alarming inside scoop only to have it be censored in order to protect the guilty who inhabit the circles of established prestige and big money. Money does more than just talk in this book. It dictates, muzzles, and tyrannizes. It determines what we see and hear broadcasted as "news." It's also guilty of murder and other shocking crimes, yet is insulated from prosecution because the system is broken. Thomas Jefferson's fear of an unfree press is the reality we all live in. Can you say "Orwellian?"Whistleblowers usually have to convey their insights at great cost to themselves, and this book aptly illustrates that fact. Borjesson herself discloses the actual story behind the mainstream lie about the explosion of TWA Flight 800 in 1996. The US Navy shot it down. What? Yes, the evidence and eyewitness reports (and the testimony of an informant in another Flight 800 story by David Hendrix) support that claim, but the CIA-controlled media fed the public another "version" of the story. Borjesson (and the other authors as well) also explain both the difficulty of first getting to the truth to begin with, and then the challenges faced in getting it communicated. Whistleblowers face real hurdles and often very real danger when telling the shocking truth.I rate a book with 5 stars if it's well written AND goes beneath the surface of polite lies to expose scoundrels. Books offering only partial disclosure sometimes also end up shilling for and protecting said scoundrels - even if only inadvertently. Those books won't get 5 stars from me. This book exposes both the scoundrels (like Monsanto, the CIA drug-runners, etc.) and the shills (ownership of the mainstream media) who are in criminal collusion with them.If you think it is simply too outlandish to think that such treachery is really that common, then I'd suggest you read my book: "Know Your Enemy: Exposing Satan's Human Army" which is about the nature of the worst scoundrels. Some people have had their conscience seared as with a hot iron. They have been voided of normal human empathy. And guess what - the Bible has a few things to say about that.You could read Gary Webb's books and/or Michael Levine's books about how utterly criminal the CIA is. But Buzzsaw is a quicker way to get to that undeniable history - disclosed in a single volume. I advise getting the 2004 edition, not the 1980 original. It will be interesting to see what Borjesson has to say in her more recent book:Feet to the Fire: The Media After 9/11, Top Journalists Speak Out.

Although I do look forward to reading the spin offs or even about Alina and Vaisle.

You by far are one if my favorite author and the GWB are by far my favorite series.

$review_text.: If you write poetry and want to publish it you need this book. It's that simple. Magazines, editors, addresses listed in alphabetical order and again in sub groups, i.e. religous, nature, humor and so forth.  The web listings - the word is really getting out-give addresses which frequently present sample works and special topics/guidelines. How useful is the book? Well I've placed ten poems this year using addresses found in it, half of this year's placements. I think it probably saved me the purchase cost in stamps and manuscripts alone.

$review_text.: I never thought I would find a whole book about passwords to be interesting, but I really like Mark Burnett's Perfect Passwords.  This short book (134 pages without the appendices, which can be ignored) is remarkably informative.  I recommend anyone developing password policies or security awareness training reading Perfect Passwords.The book is unique because the author bases many of his recommendations on research, not theory.  He says that over the course of his consulting career he has collected somewhere between 3 and 4 million passwords.  (This seems somewhat suspicious, but I suppose dropping the usernames would make that practice acceptable.)  By performing statistical analysis on those millions of real passwords, the author knows exactly what makes a bad password.Perfect Passwords does a good job dispelling common password policy myths.  I was glad to hear him report that changing passwords once a month is a stupid idea.  A weak password is not "protected" by a monthly change, since it can be broken in a matter of hours.  Instead, use 15 or more characters in passwords, and change them less frequently (perhaps every 6 or 12 months, depending on sensitivity).The author also rightfully criticizes "secret questions" and stand-alone biometrics.  Both systems suffer an important flaw: "the answer to the question is usually a fact that will never change," like the make of your first car or your fingerprint.  If secret questions must be used, add a three-digit code to the answer.  With biometrics, always accompany them with a password.I had no major problems with Perfect Passwords.  I did think that 21 pages of words in Appendix B and 16 pages of numbers in Appendix C didn't serve any real purpose.  I thought the hand-drawn figures seemed really weak in places (Figure 3.1 is a lawn sprinkler?).  One mathematical note -- pp 43-44 discuss combinations vs permutations.  With permutations, it's important to note whether a number can be selected repeatedly, or only once.  With a lottery (the book's example), numbers are usually selected once.  So, the permutations for a three digit lottery yield 10 * 9 * 8 = 720 possibilities, not 1000.Overall I liked Perfect Passwords.  This is a great addition to any security professional's library, and it contains many sound suggestions.

$REVIEW.: I haven't read it yet, but after reading Compendium 1, I feel safe in awarding this book 5 stars. And you can't do better than $36 for 48 issues of any comic book, let alone one of this quality. That's just 75 cents an issue. We haven't seen prices like that on single issue comic books since 1989. What was even more amazing is I ordered this book on 10/10/12 at 2:13 PM Eastern time and it was delivered using the free shipping option at 2:38 PM Eastern time on 10/11/12, just 24 hours and 25 minutes later.

$review_text.: In this story, we meet Wren, a single mother trying to give her son the best life possible. In the beginning, Wren and Charlie seem to live a very predictable life. This all changes when her grandmother shows up at her doorstep unannounced with plans of throwing herself a 90th birthday party and requests the presence of all of her grandchildren. After a family tragedy many years before, the siblings had had a strained relationship, to say the least. Between this, a growing relationship with the successful Paul Callahan and the reappearance of her ex, it makes for a very interesting read! Beyond all of that, it is a great story about learning to put your trust in God and that He is with us at all times through everything. In the end, it also became a great story about forgiveness and moving on from the past.Overall, I think this was a great story. I do believe I would have enjoyed it more had I not had to take a 2 week break in the middle of it, though that has nothing to do with the writing or the book itself! The characters were interesting and believable and the story of past events were revealed just enough throughout to keep me intrigued! I look forward to reading more by the authors.*I received a copy of this book from Book Sneeze free in exchange for this review. All thoughts are my own.

$REVIEW.: There isn't much in the way of guts to this book but surprisingly I enjoyed it.It follows the story of Alexis, a college girl who is recovering from a breakup with her first love and a strained relationship with her parents who are disappointed she has not embraced their christian faith. All she relies on is her brother and her close friends...but even that is going to prove to be a challenge down the track.I'm in my early 30's and was pleased to find a nice romance story without the explicit sex scenes, it does have some bad language, but it's not too bad. But even though the characters are in their early 20's i didn't find the book juvenile.The characters are really easy to like and the romance is very sweet. It is a great book I would be comfortable giving to my teenage niece to read. There are some serious issues surrounding suicide in the book, but it is dealt with tastefully and carefully. I can't go into any more detail without spoiling the storyline.I highly recommend this one and am looking for more titles by this author.

$review_text.: Though my soul may set in darkness, It will rise in perfect light, I have loved the stars too fondly To be fearful of the night. - Sarah WilliamsLucia Dicomano has lived for hundreds of years but she has no clear memory of her past. she remembers only bits and pieces and becomes aware of a power within her that she still does not fully understand. however, one fact stands out. as a Pharo of Redemption, Lucia has failed to bring her husband Vittorio to the Light after he was turned into a vampire. how do you kill someone you love?this is author Jordan K. Rose's debut novel. as a whole, i find it dark and complex and i mean that in a positive way.darkness and light are tangible forces that constantly outbid each other throughout the book. these battles heighten the burden that Lucia finds herself in.each chapter starts with Italian verses and a corresponding English translation. they are reflective of the chapters they introduce and i love the author for doing this.the characters are quite a conundrum for me and there is more to each than meets the eye. for one, i find it ironic that some of the vampires Lucia must kill and bring to The Light are also those who shelter and train her.i commiserate with Lucia and her being clueless. the author was very effective in getting this through the reader to the point that i was as irritated and impatient as Lucia in finding out what everyone knew about her and her past. even Lucia's parents were not a big help in clarifying things for her.Lucia's relationship with her husband Vittorio is also difficult to describe. when they reunite, their trust, love and passion for each other clash with fear and guilt.i felt lost now and then with what was going on but i was able to pick up on things as the story progressed. i guess, like Lucia, i needed to be more patient as well.however, there are still many gaps and issues that need to be filled and resolved and i hope there will be more answers in the next book.all in all, i found the story quite refreshing because of its unusual take on vampires coupled with the idea of slayers as divine agents of salvation.Disclosure of Material Connection: i received a copy of Perpetual Light from the author herself. i did not receive any payment in exchange for this review nor was i obligated to write a positive one. all opinions expressed here are entirely my own and may not necessarily agree with those of the author, the book's publisher and publicist or the readers of this review. this disclosure is in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255, Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.

$REVIEW.: Written by Tash MOriginally posted on confessionsfromromaholics dot comARC provided kindly by author for reviewing purposesA Fire that Burns tells the story of two individuals, Tyler and Austin, who were small town high school sweethearts until Austin disappeared in the middle of the night without a word to her fianc&eacute; and her family. The reason why is not clear to them but Tom. the brother she's closest to who also happens to be the best friend of Tyler, knows and has kept it a secret from everyone as it will reveal  the ugly side to someone that many people are blinded to. Austin's departure is a sore point in their town and something that's not going to be forgotten in a hurry.Fast forward six years. Tyler still misses her but has moved on. He always takes the day she left to remember her and hopes that she will come back. Well this year she has and Tyler discovers her return a week after she is back as Austin didn't want Tyler to know. Her mother isn't too pleased because  she was the favourite of the family and the family  is taking sides, except for Tom who welcomes her into his home. Austin turns to the one person she can trust completely outside her family: Tyler.They soon fall back into the same easy going relationship they once had but there Is only flirtation, kissing and tension because Tyler is engaged to Natasha Truman. Natasha happens to be Austin's nemesis, if you want to call the dynamics that, but because they live a town that is so small that re not enough students to make up a full class. They are frenemies and Natasha has always wanted Tyler. Now that she's got him she won't let him go and so you we have a love triangle forming and Natasha wants Austin out. She drops a bombshell that leaves Austin reeling and Tyler knowing what he wants and can't have.Tyler's torn and can't handle the fire that burns inside him for Austin. Austin knows what will happen and chooses to remain cynical despite pouring out everything to Tyler because she knows what Natasha is really like and it appears that everyone else is ignorant of the truth. So she spends her energy throwing everything into renovating the house that Tyler and she wanted to buy and live in all those years ago.A Fire that Burns is the debut book from Anne Still and tells a rich story about trying to find forgiveness in the midst of turmoil, secrets and jealously  in a small town setting. It is something that has been done before but this author brings a refreshing new take on this storyline. Not everything is clear cut and Anne has a lot going on under the surface that will surprise. You are going to cry and want to knock some sense into these characters like I did after reading this story.5 couples and you need to take a chance on this book. You will be hooked after reading just a few chapters.

$review_text.: Many citizens wake up after a bad day watching the news and ask why things are the way they are on policy. Specifically they wonder how America got to its present status on terrorism policy. We started invading Afghanistan and Iraq with the typical armored columns and airstrikes. Now we are fighting the war from these model airplanes. What happened? This book sort of answers that question.This book is a great concise history of events over the past ten years or so. It isn't everything but it does show the progress of policy over time. The book does pull together a lot of stuff you have seen elsewhere. This time you see it all at once in one source. The book also has a lot of great details of things behind the scenes. I think you will read things that you haven't seen elsewhere. You learn about how much Pakistan is helping us and how they are not. There is more background information about the UAVs. You do get to travel inside the UAV world to understand how they run.  I am sort of surprised this book did get written. I can tell the official sensors did read it. Several parts of the text have been redacted. That increases the creditability of what you do read. You can see logically from the stories how policy evolves to where it is now.This is a must for anyone in the field or anyone with a burning desire to learn about the why behind the terrorism fight.

$review_text.: 4 1/2 starsThis was a fantastic read from Lauren. I loved how Jamie and Smith were best friends, but that each was fighting their want for each other. I also loved how they were so opposite in their mannerisms. Smith is a firefighter with a mouth like a sailor, and Jamie is prim and proper. Yes, opposites do attract and these two are prime candidates. It's never told how long Smith wanted Jamie, but she's wanted him for a long time, but didn't want to ruin their friendship. Then one night the inevitable happens and Smith makes a move - unexpected and completely hot! Jamie loves it and makes a proposition to him, trying to convince herself that a week with him would ever be enough. This was a fast, hot, sexy read and I loved it. Smith is fantastic, treats Jamie wonderfully and talks dirty to her, which she finds that she loves. I loved the Mad Libs! Can't forget those, and the end was pretty awesome as well. Great characters and a great story line, I couldn't put this down if I tried. Great read from start to finish! I'd love more about hot firemen - who wouldn't?

$REVIEW.: I was fortunate enough to have had a glimpse of the early manuscript of this novel in 2004, and I'm happy to see that the finished product lives up to the brilliant premise I saw back then. The thing that surprised me most was how the action in the novel obeys laws of physics--something I wish more authors of adventure thrillers would do.The dialogue and internal monologue is witty and clever. (There is a lot of mental dueling between the protagonists.) The world-building is very well handled - hints within context, no info dumps--serving to construct an intriguing and original time and place.Although constructed in the romance tradition (back and forth POV between hero and heroine) the novel has a solid mystery at its core which should attract an audience beyond the romance genre.This promising debut should appeal to fans of historical mystery and urban fantasy as well as paranormal romance.

Featuring the budding romance and personal struggles of a former child star confused over his sexuality and a Hollywood newcomer working to put his history of poverty and abuse behind him, it is a powerful story with brilliantly drawn characters and a gripping plot. Touching on the inequities and intolerance of a society that hasn't yet given homosexuals the full rights of citizenship, it is never preachy, just real.

$REVIEW.: If you work as part of a team or need help developing a team to work together more effectively you can buy hundreds of books about team development ... or you could just buy &#34;The Secret of Teams: What Great Teams Know and Do&#34; and you&#8217;ll be fine &#8230; honestI say this because, in clear and concise language, using a narrative form, Mark Miller has addressed most of what we need to consider about groups of people working together.Mark draws an engaging picture of a leader, Debbie and her team, and their work trying to connect with and help other teams in their corporation.  Many challenges exist, since both Debbie&#8217;s team and the many teams they are working with, all have issues, as we might expect.The layers sound complex, but Mark&#8217;s enjoyable narration allows us to easily keep up with the groups and the people in these various groups without difficulty.Here are three reasons why I like this book:It&#8217;s COMPLETE &#8230;Mark includes issues on human emotional needs, performance measurement, and the interlocking dynamics of people working together, but with different goals and styles.  He covers the waterfront in terms of the diverse nature of teamwork and pulls in contributions and strategies from several different disciplines.Many business books only focus on a specific segment of the issue and this is a valid approach.  However, I enjoy the synergy which comes from blending learning from many areas.  This provides credibility and makes what you learn more valuable as you apply it.It&#8217;s CLEAR &#8230;As noted earlier, Mark uses a narrative style to illustrate the very real business and organizational development points he wants to make.  Using people, dialogue, and scenarios, laced together into a compelling story, he does this simply and effectively.We can read the same things in a whole stack of erudite and research-based books, with charts, graphs, and comprehensive treatments &#8230; or we can read Mark&#8217;s story and get the same ideas while being entertained.It&#8217;s CRITICAL &#8230;If one skill exists in business today that continues to demand our attention and energy, it is the art of working effectively in and with groups.Our increasing connectedness, 24/7 nature of work, and the ever-mounting pace of change demand that we work together and do so in a highly efficient and productive way.If we do not, we fail &#8230;The Secret of Teams is one very painless lesson in team leadership and group development.  You hardly notice you are learning solid lessons about people behavior  and group dynamics.  You are just reading an engaging story  about some interesting people, who act and sound just like your co-workers &#8230; and maybe even you on occasion.Mark Miller, well known business leader, best-selling author, and communicator, is excited about sharing The Secret of Teams: What Great Teams Know and Do with those who are ready to grow. You can find it on Amazon and in bookstores everywhere.Disclaimer:  I was given a copy of this book for review.  As I always make clear, I only publish reviews of books that have value.  This was one of the easiest books to read, review, and recommend in my memory.Wishing all business and leadership books were this much fun in the Heartland &#8230;.John

To me, it was a rip off, and a risk by disappointing the readers of this series.

$review_text.: I have been reading a few self help books since a while now
This book is really one of the best  I came across


The language is so simple and it just flows perfectly


I am yet to finish the last quarter of this book because I chose to savor it little by little


The author mentions giving affirmations to people that 'clicked' in their life and brought a major change

I would say this book as a whole 'clicks' with me
You know how it is with most people


You know that once you have the faith you will get there but it hard to have complete faith

This book helped me to open myself to have faith and have a clear idea of the nature of the Source/God/Almighty/Universe
I love this book and I am sure to read it over and over again


Most importantly I like the price for a compilation of four books.&#34;Must read!&#34;

$review_text.: I was disappointed in this book


 It was supposed to be her first adult novel
 I don't think the story of a 21 year old and 25 year olds qualifies as an adult novel


 I did finish the book, although I found it to be rather anti-climatic

 A major event was just kind of blown over
 I feel Brashares could have done much better if that part of the novel had played out more
 It was a good summer light read
 But, I would not consider it an adult novel
 I am an adult and loved The Sisterhood series, this book was just kind of ok compared to those

 Very disappointing for Ann Brashares.

$REVIEW.: Reviewed by MeliBook provided by the publisher for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookFirst of all I have to say this is a book that is not for every reader. I liked the premise of a woman finally getting her dream, yet it fell short for me. Destiny had it all but wanted more in my opinion. I mean she had Patrick and for me I thought ruined it when she wanted it also with Brandon. Right off the bat I was like she had it perfect with Patrick. Now Patrick also has some issues with him. One minute he wants Destiny then the next he is in an usual way wanting his best friend Brandon. The story kept going back and forth making me miss things. Then to top it off someone is after Brandon and it is up to Patrick to catch them before it&#8217;s too late.Samantha Wayland had a good story going but for some reason it just didn&#8217;t grab my attention. To be honest I had a hard time getting into the story. For me this kind of menage (with m/m action) was just not it for me which really saddened me because the blurb was good.

$REVIEW.: 3.50 - 4.00 starsI received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.This book is plays out just like in the synopsis

The Prince of Punk is one smoking hot rock and roll fantasy where the boy gets everything he ever wanted - a hot wife, a hot boyfriend and a hot band playing sold out venues

It&#8217;s not as easy living the life&#8230;especially when you share your bed with your wife and your gay lover

Emotions run high as the trio attempts to balance their lives in the bedroom, their families&#8217; scrutiny and navigating the paparazzi.The Prince of Punk was my guilty pleasure book of the week
I read this book in one sitting&#8230; since I couldn&#8217;t look away&#8230;it was like a sexy train wreck

At times it was a little over the top/silly/wanted to smack the heroine


I have to say I am looking forward to the next book in this series to see how this story plays out.

As I am reading &#34;The Gilded Age&#34; in this collection and comparing it to a hardcover edition, glaring errors hit me in the face. Commas are stuck randomly here and there; hyphens are omitted; compound words are separated into two words; the list goes on. Add to this the fact that foreign-language chapter epigraphs are omitted when it would be too much trouble to reproduce a foreign alphabet. I am generous with two stars, only because this is my favorite author.

Not much, anyways.  Get any group of folks together for any reason and there just has to be issues,  even if you're attempting to save the Land!  I also found myself skimming through some of the extensive travel scenes.Not a bad read,  however--well worth the time.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed this short story.  It was sweet and hot at the same time.  And I liked how the male character had a change of heart towards the female character. My only concern was the description of the male character.  This is a personal thing, whereas I do not like men with piercings or wild and crazy hair. Tattoos are more sexy to me than the others. But that is my only concern with this story and it's a small issue.  So, all in all, the story was a good read if you like a short story with lots of steamy scenes and sexual tension in it.

$REVIEW.: Audience: AdultGenre: Contemporary Romance, LDS Romance, Romantic ComedyLength: 289 pagesRating: ***** (Loved it)Pros: More fabulous swoon. LOVED the hero, Matt ... that's something I adore about Melanie's heroes: they don't run away from love. This is the perfect warm-you-up-summer-romance for the middle of winter. I wanted to go sit on the beach with my husband and kiss by the time I finished this. And like usual, Melanie's books have more than just the romance going on -- considering the hero is sort of off-stage for a big chunk of the middle, one would hope so! Ashley, the main character, definitely has some issues (some that I didn't understand, but everyone is different!)One of my romance pet peeves -- I have way too many, I know -- is a too old voice for late-twenties and thirty-something protagonists. I hate to admit this, but I'm thirty and I don't talk like a middle-aged woman. I say awesome and whatever and bummer on a frequent basis. So, ramble aside, Melanie GETS THAT and her protagonists speak age appropriately. The voice is FANTASTIC.He Said/She Said: "We need to do this again sometime," he said."Kiss? Sure.""Wow, Ashley, I meant eat pizza and take a walk, but I'll make out with you if you really want me to."Matt: "Last one in has a really big crush on the other!" I scooped my board up and headed out at a dead run, splashing in until the waves were waist high before I turned around to grin at him.He waded up slowly, his dimples flashing again. "Guilty," he said. "So very, very guilty."Disclaimer: Nothing.

 I keep books of these types loaded on my Kindle to read on the subway

 They are the perfect diversion during my short commute

 I do enjoy the Uncle John's bathroom reader books, and I will probably read all of them eventually because they are filled with fun, entertaining information, presented in brief articles.
 However, there are better books of this type by Mental Floss and Listverse

 Books like 10 Ways to Recycle a Corpse, Five People Who Died During Sex, and An Incomplete Education are a cut above this series


 That is why I give these books four stars

 There is nothing wrong with the Bathroom Reader series

 They are certainly better than a lot of other trivia / esoterica

 They are very good, just not quite as intriguing as some others.

$REVIEW.: Rumors of God presents a very common challenge for today's Christian, and does so in a loving way that keeps the reader engaged throughout the book. Authors Whitehead and Tyson work together to speak from experience and observation about amazing ways the body of Christ is working at it's best. Rumors of God reminds the reader that life with Christ is about relationship and not just existing with our creator. While reading this book I was reminded of times in my walk with God where I was at my best. I was reminded of those times when I was using my gifts and talents in the best way they were created to be used, to serve and honor God. Rumors of God presents a very clear discussion spring board for how to live your best life, the life you are called to live, and to do so passionately.I would highly suggest this book for anyone looking for a fresh look at relationship with Jesus.

While it was a pretty good read it left some things to be desired


The good stuff about the book is that the stories are interesting and I really had no idea that many people had vanished
The author really gives the facts and leaves out emotions that will pull at your heart


The author in some cases lets you make you own conclusion


The bad stuff about the book is sometime the updates on the stories run on too long, often repeating information
I would of like to hear if there were any more recent cases past the 90's

Many of the sex scenes were scorching hot without going to overboard. There was a specific scene that I found to be really hot and original. The story had its funny moments and of course issues that both Jenna and Rusty needed to resolve. It had all the right elements to make it more than just a short story. It was a well worth novella.I give Wild Child 4 out of 5 stars.Check out my other reviews at marthaczavala.weebly.com.

I was especially drawn to the lovely cover and the story's premise. Was I ever delighted by the contents! Fresh, riveting, and emotional, this story will live on in minds and hearts for years to come. The author does some very brave things with her hero that make him so real and touching you are right there in the story with him and the woman he comes to love. In an age of formulaic fiction, this novel is anything but. I am a fan of Joanne Bischoff's for life and always recommend her and her books to reading friends at every opportunity. Can't wait to read more from her head and heart!

$review_text.: This is the first mystery book I read and I really didn't feel anything extraordinary.. the plot is so predictable and it unfolds in an ingenious way.. no surprises .. no excitement ..Jacobs' writing style is probably what made me continue reading it.. I liked the way she draws her characters .. simple and skillful.

$REVIEW.: I actually got this book because I am going on a Rick Steves' &quot;Best of London&quot; tour later this year.  We booked a couple of days before and after the tour to do some stuff on our own in England, and after browsing several books (Fodor's, Lonely Planet, etc.) in bookstores, I settled on Rick's book.My reasoning wasn't that I was going on one of his tours, it truly was the best book I saw on the shelves.  The book isn't dominated by details on London, exactly what I wanted.  In fact, Rick suggests you make London the last part of your tour.  Why is this a good thing?  There are plenty of books that focus on London itself, in fact every tour book I listed before has one.  It would be like a foriegn traveler coming to the United States for a couple of weeks and only getting a book on Washington DC.Being that I've never been out of the United States before, I'm a little wary of making reservations and plans without seeing what I'm getting into first.  So not only do you get candid reviews on the sites (rated &quot;must see&quot;, &quot;try to see&quot;, &quot;see if you can&quot;, &quot;worth noting&quot;...and sections on what is a waste of time), information on how to get there, where to eat, but most importantly web pages to check out before hand.What's best is that Rick Steves is frank...doesn't sugar coat what is good and what is bad, what is a must see and what is a must avoid.  I feel more confident making reservations and plans with this book than I would have with others.

$review_text.: The Impetuous Amazon is book two in the Alliance of the Amazons series. Each book in the series focuses on one of the four Amazons and their love interest. This installment features Megan Feurer, the Fire Amazon as the main character. Just as you would think of fire, Megan is outgoing, not afraid to speak her mind and a little bit of a prankster. Do not let that fool you though, there is a softer side to her just like everyone else. Not having an easy childhood, Megan is tough and very independent. With the exception of Megan's connection with the other three Amazons and her Sentinels, she doesn't trust others easily.In book one, Megan liked to trick/prank Johann Herrmann (Joemann), one of her Sentinels. I could tell he was a crush and I really hoped he would be the one she wound up with. Johann is pretty much the direct opposite of Megan. He likes being on time, everything in perfect order, and so forth. I knew the two would butt heads as they were thrown together and the relationship grew. I wasn't disappointed, to say the least. The character building is amazing in SJames books, you get to know a bit of each character in each book, but learn a lot on whoever the main is. I love the fact that the Amazons, while powerful, have their flaws. They aren't picture perfect, and each has their own strengths. As in book one, the events throughout the book lead up to a battle. This one was pretty large, and had me wondering how the heck the Amazons would manage to succeed. SJames books are unique and just the right mix of Urban Fantasy and romance. If you haven't read this series yet, I highly suggest it.

$REVIEW.: Overall, this book is an easy to read discussion on the problems many people face in today's society

 He makes it clear that regardless of personality, upbringing, or status, all people suffer from stress in life; it just may be different for each person and have different symptoms in each

The author is very clear up front with his ideas of how "our faults demand a glaring prominence of their own" despite the perceived wonders of progress

 Dr


Swenson appears to firmly believe that many of the stresses in our lives are self-inflicted by the desire for "material and cognitive status."He is also not afraid of directing the reader to the Christian understanding of what true wealth and power are as they emanate from God, not from our own feeble efforts
 This is demonstrated well in quoting William Wilberforce's statement "Above all, measure your progress by your experience of the love of God and its exercise before men."Where Dr

Swenson really shines is his prescriptions for restoration of emotional energy, physical energy, time, and finances


 Instead of providing the reader with a range of solutions only an academic could relate to, Dr
Swenson gives prescriptions that address our common problems and are easily implementable.Again, Dr
Swenson is not afraid to bring his Christian faith into the mix of solutions


 He even goes to the point of humorously asking whether Jesus might have used a pocket calendar to illustrate how "God never intended for time to oppress us, dictating our every move." These Christian ideals also make their way through the author's discussions on the other aspects of emotional energy and finances
 For example, in one of his stronger statements, the author emphasizes, "wealth is not a primary objective of the spiritual life."Although the book provides a wealth of information and warning on lack of margins and the benefits of having them in all aspects of our lives, there is little discussion of how these ideas can play out in a life of pastor or his work

 This is not to say there are no connections to ministry as the concepts themselves would seem to be very applicable regardless of the situation; however, there does not seem to be a concerted effort to tie these concepts to areas in ministry

 Further discussion would need to be had in connecting the many beneficial notions Dr


Swenson presents beyond the individual to a larger entity such as a church body or evangelistic ministry.

$review_text.: The title of this book is modestly deceiving; there are not only templates for garments, there are examples to use eyelash and fur yarn. Some of the patterns are &quot;fur&quot; jackets, long coats, jackets with cuffs and more. If you like to do stylish knitting, and you like to shop for yarn, not entirely sure what to do with it, this book is excellent. With the templates in hand, you can create a unique garment. Particularly recommended for people who love novelty yarns.

I made several of the cookies for a cookie swap, everyone loved them. What I liked best about Cookiepedia is the clear concise directions and it is also fun to read. There is a handy space provided to add your own notes for each recipe. Even an inexperienced baker will be able to understand the recipes. The author has added helpful tips along with a picture of the cookies.  This is truly a one of a kind book. Cookiepedia  also makes the perfect gift for those that like to bake cookies. I gave Cookiepedia to several family members and friends. Cookiepedia makes baking cookies magical.

$review_text.: I was very anxious to get the newest book in John O'Brien's series and hoping that it would be as well written as the others. I was certainly not disappointed. Mr O'Brien's writing style is very unique. He not only places you (the reader) , with knowledgeable references and explanations on the how and why of everything, but continues to awe and inspire you with his use of such in-depth proclamations about life's choices and their repercussions. This book did not fall short of either of those, but did not dominate or distract. Just enough of every aspect. Yet another dimension he adds is in the fact that he puts you in the head of the character's. It is a well drawn out byplay and you tend to feel the character's emotions. It is an awesome way to read. Also with Jack, I found him to be more humanized in this one. While I could certainly appreciate him in all the others,the bantering and humor with the other characters was excellent and a much needed respite for the team and even the readers! The action scenes were so realistic, and intense you felt the racing heart , the adrenaline , heard the swish of feet, the loading of the guns, the screams of the Night Runners. You were able to feel his fear and really felt you understood his drive and love for Lynn and his children and why he does what he does, but an even better understanding. Love the Paranormal approaches and cannot wait to see where that leads. I am also very interested in the other survivors out at Sea and if they will eventually meet up, and what lies ahead for them.Again John O'Brien has left me wanting more. Anxious for the next one, but big congrats to another fantastic one!

$REVIEW.: This is another excellent offering from Dark Fuse.  I am pleased that I was given a membership to this site.  So far I have enjoyed every thing I've read.  This novella, Red Cells by Jeffery Thomas arrived earlier this week.The protagonist in the book is a likable guy.  Private detective with a few problems.  He ends up in a prison built in an unexplored alternative dimension.  We would not have much of a story is something untoward doesn't happen, would we.  Stake is left to solve the problem and save the prison inmates and staff.  He must win not only the trust of his fellow prisoners, but also the guards and administration.The character development in this book was good.  Interesting how the guards were involved in the crime, yet some were innocent and wanted to help Stake.  The gangs in this prison reminded me of current prison life or at least what I have read and watched about prison life.I read that Stake is in several of Jeffrey Thomas' books.  I would be interested in reading another on of his books.  I think Jeffrey is a fine author and I was pleased to read his workI would consider a science fiction/horror genre. I gave Red Cells 4 stars.  I would recommend this book to science fiction readers.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed this three part series; however, I must say that I felt like this book was a little rushed at the end and did not give as much story as there should have been to say about a "lost valley".  They rushed through the little village that they were in not giving the reader enough to know about the people who might have lived there.  I felt like his parents story was left out also.  Maybe that was to setup another story, but just felt like parts of the book were missing.

$review_text.: Yes, this extremely light-minded novel is a fun read, but about twenty pages into it I started to suspect it might have been more successful as a screenplay than as a novel. Everything is done in superficial stereotypes  that are more at home in the cinema than in the library. It is a love story  in the old standard form of boy meets girl, boy almost loses girl, boy  finds girl again after nearly getting involved with some other  ill-intentioned ninnie. The main character is a beautiful Greek woman who  behaves as if she has no  meaningful attachment to anyone and has no real  emotional depth. The guy is a British professor (of classics, naturally)  who is overly shy when shyness is convenient, and an overpowering  supermacho when it isn't. Hovering on the sidelines is an overachieving  department head (probably a deconstructionist) who has eyes for him and  tries to manipulate him into bed and possibly into a permanent  relationship. There are sundry students, all budding emminences and  brilliant nitwits; a cook in a restaurant on Mykonos (sexy but limited);  the heroine's parents (defenders of tradition); and a walk-on trio of  fisherman who have turned their backs on tradition by selling their  patrimony to the ''developers.'' Then there is the Poetess Sappho and a  bunch of deities who are constantly chatting in the wings and occasionally  carry out some mischief to change the course of the earthly action and  bring it all to happy ever after conclusion.  I have to take special  issue with the depiction of the woman's parents, who come off as  stereotypes of old time Greeks who have problems with the modern world.  Also, as we all know, Mykonos is a very gay place in July and August. I  have nothing against gays and I hope they have nothing against me, but if  they are going to figure in a novel, why not let them figure completely  with all their gifts and flaws? Aurelia just leaves them as a kind of  backdrop that could easliy be replaced by any other backdrop.  There is  a delightful little embellishment when Sappho becomes angry at being called  an epic poet by one of the professor's students. In revenge she sends a  strong wind that lifts his term paper into the air.  The next time  Aurelia takes pen in hand she should think in terms of screenwriting. Or  maybe she should just sit by her phone and wait for a Hollywood offer for  this work. I'll bet they call soon, bless their hearts.

$review_text.: Not because Jean Yates and I are in the same Bead Bloggers group, not because we share a publisher and not because I'm a sucker for almost all jewelry books with lovely pictures - I love Links: Inspired Bead and Wire Jewelry Creations.  I think one of the main reasons I love Links is that even as a full time jewelry designer I still learned tons of techniques and skills flipping through the pages.  Starting right at the beginning with the materials and techniques I was learning new things like what wire straightners are and how to make a flower unit with jump rings - and that is all within the first 15 pages!Another selling point for me was that the very first project involved polka dotted beads.  When it comes to polka dots I'm easy to please and the adorable Charming Tea Cup Bracelet was a perfect way to kick off the book and set the tone.  The fun charm bracelet is not only pretty to look at it, the instructions make this bracelet easy to make as well.  Jean's wire wrapping is stellar and the clear pictures and 3 pages of easy to follow wire wrapping instructions at the front of the book make sure even a newbie could conquer these skills.Supposing you are not a chartreuse and red polka dots kind of girl, don't you worry your pretty little head Links has something for every kind of jewelry maker.  The diversity in the projects is one of the things that makes this book such a necessity in your collection.  Key rings, charm bracelets, dangly earrings, lariats - you name it this book will show you how to make it.  There is not just a diversity in the types of jewelry, but also in the styles from the delicate to chunky, intricate to simple, classic to kitschy - no matter what your jewelry style Links will have something that will tickle your jewelry making fancy.Some of my other favorite projects in the book include the Sleek Square Bracelet for the wonderfully clear instructions on working with Maille and making chain.  This is a jewelry making skill that has always boggled me and Links makes it seem so clear and easy.  The Diamond Choker with it's fun cellular like structure and use of blue rubber rings (who knew blue rubber rings even existed, thanks for opening my eyes Jean) has me wanting to play with jump rings in a whole new way.  Nancy's Dancing Pearls Bracelets illustrates effortlessly how to make a double stranded twisted pearl bracelet.  My twists always looked tangled, well not anymore.As I mentioned making jewelry is my full time job and I still read this book and learned tons of new things and found myself inspired to try new designs and techniques in my own work.  Whether you are just dabbling in jewelry making or have made your fair share of baubles you are going to take something away with you after reading Links.  I know I did.

$review_text.: Book publishers are often their own worst enemies


They print such unbelievably glowing reviews on the cover that most books can never live up to them

This is a typical example


The disappointment after reading such reviews, and then the book itself, is doubled as you can feel cheated
A great idea for a story is dissipated through leaden dialogue and an increasingly boring narrative
I was less and less interested in the narrator's tale as it progressed and was very glad when I finally finished it

Dull.

$review_text.: Katriona Wilde, her sister Brit and her best friend Brad don't have a clue what they are about to get themselves into when they head into the woods for a traditional camping trip. Kate has experienced wonderful dreams that always turn into horrible nightmares, ending with the death of her `dream-lover', Arland. But are they just dreams?! They must be, because Kate doesn't know who Arland is. When Kate, Brit and Brad tumble through a portal they find while on their camping expedition, it spits them out into another world and Kate realizes that the dreams may have some truth to them, she only hopes that the death of Arland doesn't come true.Wilde's Fire is written in the present tense, and while I wasn't a big fan of present tense in the past, Krystal Wade has changed that! Though the eyes of Kate, we seeing everything as it happens. It's immediate, right now, and intense. I love the action of the scenes, Krystal is a great writer and I really enjoyed Wilde's Fire. It's fantasy at its best. Filled with magic, hidden portals, daemons... a great twist to the fantasy / supernatural genre!I want to mention a few of the characters... Katriona of course, being the main character, I will start with her. She starts off in this book as a naive young adult who has never even kissed a boy! She is thrust into this world that had only existed in her dreams and accepted it rather well considering I would have fought like hell to get back to the `real' world. My first thoughts of Kate were, oh please don't be a pushover, fight girl, fight! (I am a kick-ass heroine junkie so when I see a character come off as a little weak I always root for them to become stronger) and wow, did she ever!Brad Tanner has been Kate's friend for...well, ever, since she can remember, but little does she know he is in love with her. I rooted for Brad, even though the sexy warrior of Kate's dreams comes into the picture, I still rooted for him. Even when my brain said, `Hello?! Sexy warrior!" I still wanted Brad to have Kate. Until of course, Krystal threw in that nice little twist. (I'm not telling what, so you'll just have to buy the book and find out for yourself!)Arland. Well, he is the sexy warrior of her dreams so its only fitting that they would be together, but Arland does a great job at keep distance between them and Krystal Wade does an amazing job at showing that he doesn't really want to even though its through Kate's eyes and she has mixed feelings about what he wants.Ok, that's enough talk about the characters, I just had to ramble a little because I enjoyed them so much!Overall I am very impressed with this novel for quite a few reasons, but I think the most important one is that Krystal Wade has changed my opinion on present tense. Honestly, I really didn't like it before picking up Wilde's Fire and more often than not when reading a book written this way, I usually put it down, but with Krystal's book I couldn't put it down. I wanted to keep reading, I had to find out what Kate was going to do, what was going to happen when the dark and light clashed and who she was going to end up with. I'm still not sure about that because there are more twists to come in book two, I can feel it!

$review_text.: In Wisdom of the Native Americans Kent Nerburn tells the story of Native Americans through their speeches and teachings. We often speak of great orators of the past Plato, Socrates, Thomas Jefferson, the list goes on.The Natives had just as great speakers as well though simply stated their words bore a truth and understanding of those who lived close to nature and the world around them.Often much was said by their silence as by words, teaching by actions as well as their words and stories.Cochise,Red Cloud, Chief Joseph, and Black Elk. The list goes on and the wisdom they shared carries through to this very day.This was a well written and thoughtful work. Broken down into three stages Ways of Native Americans,the Soul of an Indian and Wisdom of the Great Chiefs, it tells the story of a people perhaps beaten but not broken, of a proud people who's wisdom is as important and Vibrant today as it was a hundred years ago. A story that needs told and retold that perhaps we can learn today what was known then. This is a welcome addition to my shelve that will receive many a revisiting as the knowledge shared can not be taken in at one sitting.

$review_text.: FAST AND CLEVER.Retribution is not your ordinary gangster gore. Charles R. Stubbs has rearranged the great order of events in his story to paint action into reaction, so your body stays perfectly still, as you are caught up reading every line, while your head spins `round to catch the many angles to the plot, where even ornithology fits the bill.Travis Williams is the man we're following, and Stubbs describes him well, making sure to add the flaws, weaknesses, fears, as our man recovers from an ordeal he lived through five years prior. Yet, he is a qualified bird watcher; so we sense a gentleness and attention to detail lurking behind his shy demeanor.As Travis learns to espouse life again, he makes plans to meet someone who caught his eye, all those years ago, Ann Butler. And thus the adventure begins, quickly, an adventure to put all their lives in mortal danger.One other character worth exploring is `Mr. Smith'. He goes by the name of Barry Styles, one of those characters we love to hate. As treacherous as he seems, Nobby, as they call him, is well described and actually as threatening as the author makes him out to be; meaning you wouldn't want to find yourself walking down the street with Nobby trailing a few steps behind.I can easily recommend this book to anyone who likes fast paced action.
$SUMMARY.: Fast and Clever

$review_text.: 'The Natashas : Inside the New Global Sex Trade' is certainly not the first book to expose the international human slave trade, but it is essential reading all the same.  Human trafficking, or "trafficking in persons," as it is called by the US State Department, is a complex and revolting issue. The more we learn about it, the more we are aghast at such a disgusting crime. Our hearts break for the victims and despair under the weight of the overwhelming numbers involved. There are many books, some quite good, others less so, but most of them are out of date--predating The Natashas by many years.  However, The Natashas is one of four recent books that stand above the rest. They are unquestionably accurate, moving and informative. Together, these four books are the essential beginning course in understanding human trafficking.'The Natashas : Inside the New Global Sex Trade' offers a desperate truth about the victims, their experiences, dark and ugly. Not an easy book to read, but an essential part of understanding the human cost of human trafficking.This is the third book to read in understanding human trafficking.  First, read 'Race Against Evil: The Secret Missions of the Interpol Agent Who Tracked the World's Most Sinister Criminals;' then 'Illicit : How Smugglers, Traffickers and Copycats are Hijacking the Global Economy;'  followed by 'Woman, Child for Sale: The New Slave Trade in the 21st Century.'

$REVIEW.: Very few things that have been written are worthy of being called The Book.  Such a title, with the definitive article, implies an authoritativeness that few works can lay claim to.  However, it is my job as a reviewer to tell you that Marc Scott Zicree's Twilight Zone Companion is, in every way, *The Book* if you are a Twilight Zone fan.  It may have lost some of its uniqueness over the years, but it has lost none of its greatness.This edition of the book was published way back in 1992, in the prehistoric days of the internet.  You could not find every Twilight Zone episode on Wikipedia, or reviews scattered across the web.  Now, of course, you can, so I can see why it might seem that Zicree's book is no longer worth buying.  However, I still heartily urge you to purchase it.  It truly is a wonderful "companion" while you're watching the show.  Zicree's authorial voice is pleasing and familiar -- the type of person you want sitting next to you while watching a TV marathon. He gives synopses of each episode and his opinions, but also goes far beyond.  He gives biographies of the principal writers on the show, detailed information about how the show came into being, opinions on the movie adaptation, and much much more.  If you like the show, you owe it to yourself to read the book.Now there are a few flaws worth pointing out.  The book can be very inconsistent in what is written for each episode of the show.  Some episodes warrant whole pages while others get a paragraph of information.  I don't think the author necessarily should have given letter grades for each episode or something like that, but consistency would have been nice.  It's so interesting hearing what he thinks about Eye of the Beholder, but what about Sounds and Silences?  Still, it's a fairly minor concern.  There's so much information here, and it's so well written and presented, that it's no wonder The Book's still in print despite the myriad other options available online.  Buy it and I'm sure you'll agree.

It might not have been so severe as the 2014 race, but it certainly showed Libby's skill and perseverance.The color photos are great in this book and kids will learn so much from the double-spread drawing that shows &#34;A Sledload of Iditarod Gear&#34; and the one that labels the 17 pieces of clothing Libby wore each day. The full-page map of the Iditarod Trail is another that youngsters will ponder.Kudos to Libby for this heartwarming, sometimes heart-stopping, autobiography for young readers and to Shannon Cartwright for her awesome art that compliments the story in a delightful way.-Hope Irvin Marston, author of EYE ON THE IDITARON: AISLING'S QUEST.

$REVIEW.: Tori is a young and successful anesthesiologist. She just arrived in Atlanta to join a lucrative practice. On her first day she meets an attractive female in her new condo elevator. As faith would have it, they would be working together at the hospital. A series of other events would either solidify their love or force their love into hiding.Pride uses the lesbian community to illustrate how we must take a chance on love. The characters teach us to be honest and open to past hurts so we can move forward. The taboo of African American homosexuality is broken while the power of love overshadows that which we don't understand. The storyline developed at a good paced but it the ending seemed rushed.This book is a great read for those seeking to understand the lesbian lifestyle, wanting to celebrate the power of choices or knows that there is true love out there for everyone.  I wish there was more character development and detail on the alternative lifestyle in Atlanta.  There are several erotic love scenes and sensual poetry that may shock the guarded reader.  I plan to keep Pride on my authors to watch list.

$review_text.: Deanna Fei has written a story about three generations of women in one Chinese family, all of whom are strong, capable and successful but each of whom also has a hidden secret, burden, or problem. They have not shared this personal aspect of themselves with anyone in the family because they feel it would be a sign of weakness. Instead, each struggles alone creating alienation and separation from the one thing they really need, which is support, understanding, and acceptance from those who love them the most. In the first 12 pages of the book, the reader is introduced to Irene a woman in her mid-fifties who recently and unexpectedly lost her husband Bill to a fatal car crash. Irene was totally surprised by Bill's sudden decision to accept a job assignment in Maine, which he did independently, without first discussing it with her. He had explained he "needed a break." Irene felt she was abandoned. She had announced to each daughter, "Your dad is leaving us," which is how she felt. When he said "Good bye", she had uttered the fateful words, "Good riddance" which now haunt her relentlessly as she rethinks back to the day he drove off. Irene feels she has fallen down a black hole from which she can not return, she entered that dark tunnel from where she can not find the light at the end.When Irene married, she was at the height of her career, a genetic research scientist working for a firm which was seeking a cure for Alzheimers Disease. Irene initially had outstanding results and felt she was closing in on discovering the cause of this very serious chronic illness but then without warning, her mice died of unknown causes. No one who took over her research (after she took a maternity leave of absence with the birth of her first daughter) could duplicate her results, minus the dead mice, of course. After that point, Irene dedicated her self to becoming a successful mother, she put forth the same effort and energy into motherhood that she did into nearly everything else in her life - she aimed to succeed, to become the best. She decided to celebrate special events and holidays something not done in her past, to create memories, traditions in her family, which now included three daughters and a husband. Irene had grown up in China where the only birthday celebrated was her brother's, when her mother made longevity noodles. Irene embraced American customs and traditions with a passion. She created a coccoon of  safety and love for her family but the sudden death of her husband of thirty years changed everything in her life. Irene felt her life unraveling completely. Two of her daughters were adults and the third nearly so, essentially they no longer relied on her. Irene definitely felt alone. Then she got the bright idea of taking a tour to China with her three daughters, her only sister and her mother. Taking a trip together was something they never did before. This trip gave Irene focus and promised a closeness she wish she had developed much earlier in life with all of them. Due to the death of their dad, her three daughters reluctantly agreed to go on the trip. Little did they imagine how it would alter their perspective on the meaning of family, love and provide an understanding of their ancient Chinese roots. It provided a lasting and positive impact on their lives which they could never have otherwise achieved. All three generations of women in Irene's family developed a bond they never expected to happen! Most of them joined this tour reluctantly. Even her sister Susan, who was not thrilled with the idea either, had come face to face with a personal nemesis of the past, with which she needed to make peace.Irene's eldest daughter, Nora had become a successful Wall Street broker, one of the few females to break into this traditional male role. However, unknown to anyone in the family, she had problems with committment to her boyfriend Jesse. Everyone naturally thought Jesse was the problem, but in fact, he had asked Nora to marry him several times and she delayed her response, being satisified to leave things as they were, ie. living together. Nora had a morbid feared he would cheat on her, like his father had done to his mother. In China, Nora found herself in a difficult predicament, an unexpected event occured, something for which she was totally unprepared. To her amazement, when her personal predicament became known to her family, she was embraced with their love and support, which seemed unimaginable to her before opening up to them. Irene's second daughter, Kay, went to live in China after graduating from college. She wanted to explore her laojia, ancestral homeland, to get a feel for her roots. She was studying in China and had a passion for women's rights. She also strung along several male friends without getting personally involved with any of them. She had not known what it was to fall in love and give of herself completely, that is, until she met Byron, another Chinese American passenger on this tour. Sophie, Irene's youngest daughter, was destined to be the third valedictorian in the family. She was completing applications for college, when her mother brought up the idea of a tour to China. Sophie had a hidden secret which she had accidentallyy revealed only to her boyfriend. To her embarrassment and eventual relief, her secret problem would become known to her whole family who would help her deal with it and conquer it. Lastly, Irene's mother, Lin Yulan, who was an enigma to both of her adult daughters as well as to her three granddaughters, turned out to have a hidden past which awed the family: they learned grandma had been a revolutinonary working for the Nationalst Chinese and for women's rights. They all developed  a new respect for her. Ma, as she was called, lived in California with Lou, her eldest and only son. She had not spoken to her husband, who remained in China, for over 15 years, no one knew or understood why. It was believed she got fed up with his womanizing outside of marriage but that was not the real reason. As the story ends, the reader is privileged to learn the truth. The only conflict I have reading this novel is why the author does not let the family learn of Grandma's reasons for breaking off relations with her husband. Perhaps, it should remain unknown because in reality, there are many unrevealed family secrets that die with those who are buried, on the other hand, for this author ir provides material for two new books, a prequel and a sequel on this family, and one to include this subject. I hope the author reads my review and takes up this suggestion! This book is thoroughly enjoyable. It is well worth learning what fateful event occurred between Grandpa and Grandma which could never be forgotten or forgiven. The reader will be surprised what an interestng twist the author managed to weave into this magnificent novel. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]

$REVIEW.: The top ten "superfoods" according to author David Wolfe: goji berries, cacao, maca, bee products, spirulina, blue-green algae, marine phytoplankton, aloe vera, hempseed, and coconuts. What are superfoods? Think Superman and you get the idea. To be more specific, they are not exactly foods and not exactly herbs, but are a class of the most nutrient-dense, potent, and super-concentrated foods on the planet. Each has a dozen or more unique properties. They are a class of foods known as "adaptogens:" distinct from other substances in their ability to boost the endocrine and immune system and the power of the body's response against stressors. Additionally, they normalize the body by strengthening under-functioning systems and toning down hyper-functioning systems. I could go on about the virtues of superfoods, but you'll want to find out for yourself--you really will.Author David Wolfe has done a superb job of finding and sharing the best sources for these foods (most are easier to find than you think), researching their history, properties, and healing benefits, and offering both beginner and advanced raw food recipes. Seven foods that didn't quite make the top ten, but merited honorable mention, are also included. His passion for bringing these healing foods to everyone on the planet and raising the collective body and soul vibration is only equaled by his knowledge and exuberance in sharing what he knows. After reading Superfoods you'll be saying, "I want what he's having!"Buy this book; it's beautifully designed, information-rich and has great photographs. Then choose a superfood (or ten) that appeals to you, add it to your diet, and get optimal health! My advice: buy extra copies for your friends and family because you'll want to keep your own copy close at hand.

$review_text.: The Achievement Factory is an incredible volume of information and an in-depth tutorial on how to achieve (...). You fill in the blank with whichever dream you have and then follow the steps within the book.I found a lot to like in this (the writing was impeccable and engaging), but a few parts really struck home and were unique. Visualization magic formula was phenomenal. I won't tell you what the author suggests, but it's an activity and it really forces you to think. I loved it. And I learned a bit about myself in the process. Another favorite was the Brain Diet. And it isn't Omega-3. It's better. There's also Fitness for the Brain and I found myself nodding and saying "of course", a nutritionist would recommend proper diet and fitness for a healthy body...why not the brain? I also like the section near the end entitled "Last five minutes of the day", a wrap up of sorts, taking stock of and acknowledging your progress.There's a quote in this book that sums it up nicely, "Big dreams have big energy." I've read numerous self-improvement books and I learned some new tricks that caused me to take stock of how I currently approach the road to betterment. I recommend this to anyone who is needing a boost, moral support, and an intelligent guide to achieving their goals.

$REVIEW.: Although Jake Broussard and Torrie Thibodeaux are both from New Orleans, they come from different parts of the city which places a seemingly unbreakable class barrier between them

Jake and Torrie have known each other since they were children and the connection between them is very strong, even when they were apart

When hurricane Katrina blasts her deadly winds through their city, Jake and Torrie are brought together again.Torrie and Jake realize they are meant to be together but their love will be tested as their families and the effects of the storm's destruction constantly pull them apart
Jake is from the right side of the tracks and Torrie from the wrong one
Through her visions, Torrie saw the storm coming, but she can't see a future with Jake

Will their love be strong enough to see them through?In Forever and a Day, Torrie and Jake's angst filled love story is told against the backdrop of hurricane Katrina

 Although many events may be depicted fictionally, they are still powerful and heartbreaking
 Jake's and Torrie's lives were changed forever, but through the heartache and loss came a love so strong nothing could destroy it

 I loved Jake and Torrie

Their past, present and even their future is touching and romantic
 I admire Torrie's strength and Jake's protectiveness
Forever and a Day is a passionate, poignant, and well written story.Nannettereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

$REVIEW.: Very useful and well put together book.  Easy to navigate when you're looking for specifics yet worth reading in it's entirety. Many physical therapists use this book and photo copy specific pages for their clients to reference.I bought (2) of these books because it is such a great book.  My daughter was still in chiropractic school when I gave one to her as a gift.  She's a chiropractor now.  She loves this book.The book addresses the whole body and explains where they are, what they are and why these points are "triggers". I suffered from vertigo for years (a miserable thing) but found a way to eliminate it completely using the information in this book on myself.I have to say though, at first, I wondered why they used an older man in the drawn illustrations but recognized it as the co-author of the book.  Who better to show  exactly how to find and relieve trigger points on yourself.

My goal is to definitely focus on how I communicate more as this will help me across the board. Definitely learned a few things while reading this book.

$REVIEW.: I've championed Irish author, Laurence o'Bryan's thriller series from the start. I have a soft spot for historical thrillers, and I've found O'Bryan's writing to be fast paced and incredibly easy to engage with. I thoroughly enjoyed the second book in the series, The Jerusalem Puzzle, and it left me craving more. I had this last book in the trilogy pre-ordered as soon as it became available, and I zipped through the book much quicker than I expected.Readers may be aware of the continuous theme of the discovered manuscript/puzzle in this series, which has caused Sean Ryan and his now wife, Isabel Sharp some grueling experiences along the way. From being attacked by eels, to discovering burnt bodies, kidnapped, locked inside caves in the middle of nowhere ... Let's just say, Sean and Isabel haven't had the most easiest of relationships. And The Manhattan Puzzle isn't about to let up on the duo anytime soon!When Sean doesn't return home from working at a bank, Isabel starts to worry. They have a nice romantic weekend planned in Paris to look forward to. But Isabel has a niggling in the back of her mind that something is amiss. As she starts to search for him, Isabel finds herself being dragged to Manhattan on his trail, but when she discovers that their son, Alek has been kidnapped, things really start to heat up. Plus, Sean has been accused of murder too. Isabel knows that the bank is trying to hide something, something serious. What she isn't aware of, is how that blasted symbol she and Sean unearthed in Istanbul will come back to haunt her, testing her courage as well as her love for her husband.You know what? Good on Laurence O'Bryan. I bet it took some guts to completely turn the series on its head and write it from Isabel's perspective. I think it works perfectly, and actually I found her character had much more genuine emotion. I connected so much more with Isabel, which is exactly what's needed here. You need to feel her frustration at not being able to find her husband. You urge her on to not give up, to get to the bottom of it all. God only knows what I would have done in her situation. Isabel's chain of thinking, her paranoia and her blind faith are all respectable as well as very readable.Of course, you are also reintroduced to some of the side characters as well here. Xena, Lord Bidoner as well as Henry the MI5 style man get plenty of focus. I think this is what really makes these thrillers stand out - especially when compared to the likes of Dan Brown and Raymond Khoury, whose books each tell a different story, with different characters. The long running storyline of the puzzle, as well as discovering the true nature of both Xena and Lord Bidoner is very pleasing. I actually really liked Xena's character. She was clever and intriguing, and bound to be hiding so much more in that quiet exterior.The Manhattan Puzzle isn't void of action either. I mean within the first few pages someone is brutally castrated, and a stripper found murdered. As to be expected with thrillers like this with religious aspects, sacrifice and ritual killing isn't original, but it is exciting and it captures your attention. How could it not? And to be honest, with the murders, as well as the chase scenes, I found everything rather realistic and authentic, which is also a major plus. I'll also reveal the word 'rats' to you too and let you look out for that part yourselves.To be honest, I actually found The Manhattan Puzzle to be the best book in the series and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I can hardly fault it - it had be hooked! If I were to find a downside, I would have to say the actual solving of the 'puzzle' was a bit rushed. I only wish that bit was a bit better explained and more explored. I mean this puzzle has baffled the antagonists for ages, and runs through three books, just to be solved in what two paragraphs near the end?With constant updates and referencing, The Manhattan Puzzle can be read without the need to read the previous two books, but I strongly suggest against that. You need to be familiar with the characters' backgrounds as well as the motives of Lord Bidoner, and I think having read the previous two book in the Puzzle series only heightened my enjoyment of this. It's so easy to get in to, and Isabel is the true star in here. Her anger at Sean for not coming home is least of her concerns when it all kicks off, and believe me when I say that you won't look back.

$REVIEW.: lots of people says this teaches you to beat your child with a rod - if you know anything about the Bible you will know that the rod represents discipline and when used properly, will "train up a child" in the right way - he will be obedient, happy, understanding the rules, boundaries and consequences for his actions -  I recommend this book to anyone that needs to get a hold of discipline issues. There are some parts that are a bit extreme - like "if you love your children you won't put them in a formal school"  (that is not an exact quote). If course, most children in a brick and mortar school are loved just as much as a homeschooled child. I think the point was to say, stay involved, put your children first, always. Raising them will the single most important job in your life.

$review_text.: So, I knew from the start this going to be HOT, I mean it's written by Alyssa Turner and thats just the name of the game in her books


 Her books are more then that though, they have plots and a storyline that flows, characters as real as you and me and they have, well to put it simply everything you could want in a book!Polished is about Rory and Spencer, their love for each other is the stuff of legends
 They are on the same wave length in every way

 They are perfect for each other
 They both have secret desires though, and that is where Jack comes in


 Oh, Jack

 I am in lust with him!!! Jack is the playboy who hides behind the facade to hide his misery
 He finds everything he could want it Spencer and Rory.The relationship between the three is awesome, not just the sex either

 They get along and fit so well together as friends too


 They work on all levels

 They click in the bedroom so well

 Jack dominates Rory and Spencer giving them what they all need, without feeling guilty.I will never look at a pot hanging rack the same way again!!The BDSM is not to heavy that those not into reading it won't mind, and those who like reading it will be good too.I loved how Jack would constantly be telling Rory don't ask him if he is ok, he has his safeword
 It was a gentle reminder to everyone (including the reader)
 It provided them the out they needed and the freedom to explore their own desires.Jack was just amazing, he is so flawed and beat down by his father, yet he has this heart of gold that just shines through

 Rory, Spencer and Jack are by far suited for each other so perfectly, their story made me laugh, and sigh, whimper in excitement and blush alot


 (Specially since I was reading while at work...)Definitley recommend this amazing hot love story!

$review_text.: I don't always download a book promoted to me in a Twitter direct message, but the price was right, so I thought, what the heck, I'll put it on my Kindle. I am so glad I did! It was a wonderfully written, witty, and poignant tale of a quadriplegic and his adjustment to life as well as his quest for a cure and for love. The characters are rich and colorful; the story well-paced. Although the novella does not take long to finish, you may be sad when it's over--it's that good. I highly recommend "The Walking Man" to others.

$REVIEW.: Okay... It has taken me three days to figure out how to rate this book. I have thought and thought and thought some more about it. Never have I had this much trouble deciding what to do. Do I rate it on the writing??? If so, then it would be a 5+ review. I loved Mia's writing style and can not wait to read more, (maybe something a little less angsty PLEASE!!) Do I rate it on the story?? It would have to be a 2 for me.. and I will explain later. Or do I rate it on the fact that it made me FEEL even though I HATED the feeling I got from it??? I just don't know so we will stick with a 4!!!So this book completely took me away from my comfort zone. I knew what it would be about and call me a chicken.....cluck cluck... but I read the ending first to see what happens. No way could I read this and not know ahead of time. My heart would have completely broken if not!!!I hate cheating in books but can tolerate it and forgive the characters if I like them. Unfortunately, in this book, I HATED Cathy and Arsen. She is broken by the fact that she has had so many miscarriages and is distancing herself from her perfect husband Ben (who is comletely wonderful) and welcomes the attention of Arsen, the young playboy who persued her. I think the reason this book hurt so much was because of how perfect Ben was. He was so supportive and just wanted to help Cathy. It was so hard that I had to skim several parts of the book. It just HURT so much to read. Cathy was unbelievably cruel to Ben and extremely selfish. I just could not get past the things she did and thought. Some parts I wanted to unread!! One scene in particular just broke me... the party scene gutted me. At that point, I could not deal with Cathy anymore and wanted her to remain completely alone the rest of her life!!!! (yes, I have strong feelings for her!!)I never liked Arsen or Cathy but by the epi, I did have a small feeling for Arsen.... Cathy, still not so much!! The ending... I won't say what happened except it isn't what I wanted but I can live with it. I really have no choice though and have to accept it!!!I can't say I loved this book because it is not my type. That is no fault of the author's but my own. It's not you, it's me kind of thing. However, the writing style gripped me and I couldn't set it down. It did make me feel things and I am still thinking of the characters. That is a testament to the great writing skills of Mia Asher.

 Sometimes 3  to 5 times a day

 By the time the surgery date came, I was so calm and relaxed that my husband was in shock


 I played it after surgery also to promote healing


 One of the suggestions is to ask your body to heal 3 times faster while you are sleeping

 All my incisions have healed beautifully but in one section, I overhealed!  They said it is so rare...so I have to have a short surgery to correct the overhealing in one spot!  That is powerful!

$REVIEW.: I was delighted to find a box of three books with senior citizens as the protagonists!!!  However, I was very disappointed. The plots had potential but the author tries too hard to be funny. It is improbable that seniors have as many fist fights and hair pulling as she has her characters do. Plus, she tries too hard to creat slap stick. It falls flat. Overall, here plots are too improbable, too thin, too contrived. Her writing is full of grammatical errors. Proof reading should have be done.

$review_text.: Well, I've seen all kinds of sugar-coated reviews on this book and they are absolutely correct


 I'm usually the first to say that the characters that live inside an author's head can't be changed

 They just ARE
 That being said, with the sugar coated story, you also have two sugar coated men

 I am not sure if this was meant to correct but I saw two twink-type guys
 Hard to imagine one as a cop and one as a head of a Russian mob family
 So, I think it should be said, that if you ARE NOT looking for two masculine men, or even one for that matter, and you want a sweet read, here's your book

Oh, and yes, there is a lot of sex.

$REVIEW.: This was good. Unfortunately I got the old version. But I could see the potential. There were a few things that bothered me. Such as seducing and having sex with the person you are suppose to be protecting. Not only that but in the beginning Ryder brought over two of his subs and they went to at it all night. Now Im just saying wouldn't you loose your focus. And Maya is in the next room having to listen to it. Then the chief Ryder's boss is all cool with them messing around, just make sure you are protecting her first. Um ok sure. Then there is Ryder and his temper tantrums. I mean come on! Gezz... Yeah under it all he has a big heart but he has a temper and yelled at so darn much. Nate on the other hand was such a sweet heart. He counter balanced Ryders roughness. Maya just got on my nerves. She was young and very immature. Always crying and complaining.What I did like was the banter. The arguing which lead to sexual tension. Loved Nate always being the voice of reason. Loved Nate being a shoulder to cry on. Loved Nate. Maybe I will reread it later with the updated version.

$REVIEW.: As the title states, this book is the study of the classical art of Tai Chi Chuan style and Qigong

Dr Yang, as usual, writes a clear, concise and complete treatise and study of the science and art
There is also a detailed analysis and treatment of Qigong which I found to be personally very valuable
The complete long form of the Yang style is offered along with the history and description of the geographical, philosophical and mental differences of the form itself


There is no one way to approach even the Yang style of Tai Chi.Dr

Yang, as in his other writings and DVDs, never disappoints when he explores and teaches every aspect of the subjects

He imparts his knowledge in a detailed yet interesting format

He teaches the very essence of the art form
There are a plethora of photos which help explain the text and are easy enough to follow so that a student can learn and practice the exercises.Master Yang teaches the use of body movements rather than just the hand movements so that the student learns to relax the body and calm the mind

Most importantly, the student learns that the in the practice of Tai Chi Chuan movements, the student improves in fitness and possibly is able to find this and Qigong as a  cure to many illnesses.All in all, while the text is easy enough to read, the student should give deep thought as to the meaning and the philosophical content which Dr


Yang brings to his writings
The photos are clear and can be followed easily enough


I am sure that the DVD of this title would be a major complement to the book.

$REVIEW.: Although I find a D/s situation very fascinating and alluring, I couldn't come to grips with this M/s concept or a Polyamory lifestyle.  I couldn't wrap my head around the concept of someone willingly placing themselves in a degrading position of slavery, or sharing their Dom..or exposing themselves in a public setting.  But this review isn't about my personal ideals.In this story, Jill is like a sheltered, shy PTA type woman gone wild...[or coming alive - whichever your POV].  This is a slow, sensuous journey into the very real realm of BDSM lifestyles..introducing a sheltered, recently divorced, shy woman to an intriguing, erotic, edgy, submissive life of a slave.  The story is told in the first person, which doesn't detract or lessen the connection of the characters.Now, I'm all for women expanding and broadening their horizons and sexual curiosities in a safe environment, but I gotta say even though the character Jill uses her brain and doesn't enter into this triad/slave/master (M/s) relationship without forethought and extensive research - - I still felt she was too intelligent to follow this kind of lifestyle.  Yeah I know she was extremely troubled, emotionally unsatisfied and lonely in her marriage, still I couldn't see her falling for such a mind controlling situation no matter how unloved she might feel.  She just didn't seem that gullible or weak minded.  And then to subject herself to humiliating situations (losing her inhibitions), allowing other males to touch her as per her Masters direction... was, again, beyond fathomable.  She naturally begins to lose her sense of self, voluntarily...allowing her Master to make her decisions down to which movie she'll watch!  She slowly becomes unable to make the smallest decision.She enters into such a M/s relationship with a few substantial misgivings at first, but through her Masters' subtle persuasive coercion and her need for acceptance and love, she comes to accept and then depend on Rutger (Sir Rune) for the smallest detail.  She goes through the usual adjustments to such a relationship...defending herself to outsiders (friends, co-workers and family) to the point of eventually withdrawing and removing herself from any outside pressures or forces..even to leave her family (to which she wasn't close to in the first place...so, no loss).  Inside her triad family she goes through jealousy and other conflicting emotions - - then begins to tear apart her pro-argument[s] FOR such a relationship.  All part of growing and adjusting.I thought this story was, all in all.. well told.  Not sure if I'll read Sunni's story though.

$REVIEW.: Book provides a lot of information about different memory mnemonics used for increasing memory.  The writer introduces the mnemonic, tells about its development and its use; and then tells about results people have achieved using the mnemonic.  I liked the background information and the explanation of the mnemonic.  I would have liked to have seen practical examples and guided use of the various mnemonics.  I think Ron White  in his &#34;Memory Improvement: How to Improve Your Memory in Just 30 Days&#34; does a much better job guiding the reader through the use of the various mnemonics.  However, Kenneth Higbee does a great job providing the background.

$REVIEW.: Hand of Fate by Lis Wiehl is the second book in the Triple Threat series


I believe this one started out much better than the first book and had me on my toes from the very first chapter.In Hand of Fate, the host of the radio talk show, The Hand of Fate, is murdered with poisonous gas


Jim Fate is known to speak his mind and now somebody has decided it is time for him to go


 This all happens while he is on air and thus it sends the city into an uproar.The triple threat team, FBI special agent Nicole Hodges, crime reporter Cassidy Shaw, and Federal prosecutor Allison Pierce immediately begin their work on solving this crime
Can they do it??If a good mystery is your style of reading, then this is the book for you


It is very much filled with circumstances that surround us today and therefore the book seems even more real to the reader

Another very interesting part of this book are the letters at the end that come from factual radio personalities


Each wrote to the author wondering if they were the inspiration for the main character, Jim Fate.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] program.

$REVIEW.: I am a devourer of everything fantasy and I thought this was just another novel with a cliche story and hackneyed characters....but I was wrong. Written in first person, unique from the start, the reader is compelled to read further into the main character, Joe's, plight. From a male point of view, this tale is very intriguing. Unexpected twists and character I can sink my teeth into....without having to take long to get into the story.The details of HELL are exceptional and Joe as a main character makes the journey a human one. Torn apart by his daughter's death, this journey is a dark one. But one the reader will never forget.I look forward to reading more from this author.

$REVIEW.: Ninety percent of this book is about adopting and maintaining a diet and exercise plan that will reduce body fat percentage, increase LBM, and lead to a more healthy body.  The information in the &quot;Abs Diet&quot; can be beneficial to beginners to nutrition, weight training, and cardio, but for those with the basics down, it likely contain information already known.  Here is a reiteration for the umpteenth time of the following:  The Glycemic Index (GI).  Avoid the starvation mode by eating small, balanced, and nutritious meals throughout the day to keep the metabolism up and running by eating approximately every 3 to 3.5 hours. Keep your body adequately hydrated.  Avoid sugars, fructose and corn syrups.  Really?  The basic theme of feed the muscle burn the fat, that has been regurgitated for years now.The only portion of this book that focuses on defining the abdominals and obliques is the last chapter.  So why the title?This book is put forth by two authors with backgrounds in health and nutrition.  David Zinczenko is editor and chief of &quot;Men's Health&quot; magazine, which gives advice to the perrenially out-of-shape and uneducated, according to its own statistics on it market base readership.  The title &quot;Abs Diet: The Six Week Plan to flatten your stomach,&quot;  is another attempt to ride the recent health wave of out-of-shape Americans who are spending billions to obtain any information they can get their hands on regarding anything that is 1. &quot;healthy&quot; and 2. will make them look better.For someone to shed the fat that covers their abdominals they need to very knowledgeable about their diet to a &quot;T&quot;  This takes lots of time, trial and error, and consideration, while simultaneously living a healthy lifestyle and maintaining a properly executed exercise regimen.  All these things mentioned, can NOT be done in a mere 6 weeks.  The title alone insinuates and perpetuates the myth of &quot;spot reduction&quot; when it comes to reducing body fat percentage.Those who seek instant gratification with little effort or long-term foresight will be the buyers of this book.  Check out Tom Venuto.

$REVIEW.: Summary: In a simple world recovering from a devastating war, the Taylor family tries to hold the family farm together after the long absence of their father. Then a boy with a jetpack crash-lands into the farm being chased by a massive robot left over from the war. In "Visitor in the Field" and "Secrets of the Cell" the mysteries of this boy, Jet Jones become intertwined in the Taylor's family life and survival.Review: Normally I would delve into the intricacies of plot and characterization, but anything beyond what I shared in the summary would  be treading into spoiler territory. I love these graphic novels. They are among my favorite.Both drawn and written by the amazing Royden Lepp (David: The Shepherd's Song), the first two volumes tell the story predominantly in images. It is a strength of these novels. Much of the emotion from the story comes from Lepp's emotive and poignant art. Lepp's art is incredibly unique and detailed.Lepp has created a world where prairie farms can successfully coexist with highly developed robot war machines. The real drama, however, comes from the Taylor family. During the devastating war, their father was drafted into the war, and years later he has not returned. His eldest son, Roman, still writes him a letter everyday, and those letters frame the entire story.Anyone who enjoys graphic novels, phenomenal art, visual storytelling, family drama, robots, robot war machines, robot farmers or beautifully bound books should rush out to grab a copy of these books.I cannot possibly recommend them enough!Rating: 5/5 (I loved it)

$REVIEW.: Review of The New Atheism by Victor StengerIn what may be his best book to date, Victor Stenger (Professor Emeritus of Physics) provides a much needed summary, elaboration, and defense of the main theses of the so-called "New Atheists" (NAs), known for their widely-publicized, unrelenting, and passionate critiques of theism and religion in general. Among these NAs, Stenger includes authors of recent bestsellers in the United States: Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens, and himself. Not only does the book provide an excellent review of NA arguments, but it skillfully rebuts many of the primary objections voiced by critics of the NAs, coming from both theistic and atheistic camps. While Stenger is hardly a "new" atheist, having written numerous books and articles over the past decade that deal critically with religious and paranormal claims from a scientific perspective, his recent bestseller, God: The Failed Hypothesis (GTFH), meshes harmoniously with the perspectives of the other NAs.Two primary issues run through the books and articles of the NAs: (1) Whether or not God and other supernatural entities exist, and (2) Whether or not belief in such entities, and the religious doctrines that accompany them, are ultimately harmful or beneficial to individuals and to society at large. It is worth noting that these are independent questions, as belief in a falsehood might still turn out to be beneficial (e.g., the placebo effect). Both of these issues are covered well within the approximately 250 pages of Stenger's book, but would require larger tomes to be fully fleshed out. According to Stenger, NAs advance the following general arguments in relation to these two issues. First, religion should not be entitled to a level of respect or to a special immunity from criticism beyond that granted to other areas of human experience and discourse, such as politics and economics. Second, contrary to the views of some philosophers and scientists, religions do indeed make substantive claims about the nature of reality (e.g., concerning the existence of supernatural entities such as gods and the truth of religious doctrines); these claims, NAs argue, are in principle amenable to scientific inquiry and evaluation. Third, by continuing to preserve and promote the framework of religion and its attendant superstitious and irrational ideas, religious moderates, while themselves relatively innocuous in their liberal and non-literal interpretations of scripture, are inadvertently aiding and abetting practitioners of more harmful fundamentalist forms of religion. Indeed, in adhering more faithfully to the basic tenets of their religion, Fundamentalists at least display the virtue of being less hypocritical than their moderate counterparts. Fourth, morality is a natural biological and cultural phenomenon that does not come from religion. Indeed, many religious precepts, such as those supporting slavery and the subjugation of women, would be considered highly immoral from a modern perspective. Fifth, religion and irrational thinking in general have caused considerably more harm than good in the world throughout history and continue to jeopardize the future survival and flourishing of humanity.In his earlier book, GTFH, Stenger defended the view, shared by other NAs, that the existence of God is a legitimate hypothesis that is amenable to scientific evaluation. Specifically, the characteristics of the God of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam imply certain observations that can be empirically confirmed or disconfirmed, similarly to the predictions of any other scientific hypothesis. After a thorough examination of the evidence, Stenger concludes, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the God of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam does not exist. In the present book, Stenger recapitulates and elaborates on some of the arguments presented in GTFH and further disputes the maxim "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" often made in the context of arguments concerning the existence of God. On the contrary, absence of evidence, where it is expected to be observed, does indeed constitute evidence of absence. While this observation is not new, and can be found in the earlier works of "Old Atheists" such as philosophers Keith Parsons and Julian Baggini, Stenger is unique in his systematic application of this principle to the question of God's existence. While the presently available evidence would seem to count against theism, Stenger reminds us that scientists are not (or should not be) closed-minded or dogmatic. He writes, "[i]f and when anyone finds evidence for the existence of God, gods, or the supernatural that stands up under the same stringent tests that are applied in science to any claimed new phenomenon, with no plausible natural explanation, then honest atheists will have to become at least tentative believers." (p. 15).Stenger's comparatively calm and respectful tone contrasts with the more aggressive and sometimes condescending posture of several of the other NAs. Indeed, Stenger's less confrontational approach may be more successful in winning converts to a naturalistic worldview than one which immediately alienates the reader by provoking a defensive reaction as soon as the book is opened. One also cannot fail to be impressed by Stenger's economy of words and succinct arguments, features apparent also in his earlier works.While Stenger presents "New Atheism" as a novel movement in the cultural landscape of the United States, the differences between the "New Atheists" and the "Very Old Atheists" (and agnostics), such as Diderot, Hume, d'Holbach, Shelley, Ingersoll, and Russell are rather modest. Some of these latter authors are well known for their merciless and vociferous criticisms of religion. For instance, d'Holbach's 18th century works, Good Sense and System of Nature, are widely considered masterpieces of anti-religious philosophical literature, written from an unabashed atheistic perspective. Perhaps, as Stenger notes, what primarily distinguishes the NAs from the Old Atheists is the boost atheism has received from an advanced scientific understanding of the world (quantum physics, relativity, cosmology, and evolution being the most relevant areas), and from the public's interest in and receptivity to critiques of religion in light of the September 11th attacks (which, Stenger argues, were motivated directly by Islamic ideology). Thus, the NA movement is perhaps more a reflection of the public's interest in `anti-religion' than of the content of the NA books per se, which can be found also in the works of Julian Baggini, Richard Carrier, Joseph Daleiden, Theodore Drange, David Eller, Nicholas Everitt, AC Grayling, Michael Martin, and Keith Parsons (just to name a few), whose books were available several years before the bestsellers of the NAs were released. Nonetheless, Stenger's book ranks among the finest of contemporary critiques of religion and defenses of a naturalistic worldview.Several particularly strong points in Stenger's book deserve special mention. Stenger swiftly neutralizes the claim, often made by critics of the NAs, that 20th century secular regimes, such as those of Stalin, Hitler, and Mao, had committed more atrocities against humanity than in all of the religious wars throughout history combined. Stenger notes that none of these regimes killed in the name of atheism per se, but rather in the name of dogmatic political ideologies that demanded an unwavering quasi-religious adherence. Moreover, these leaders collaborated with religious institutions when advantageous, and persecuted and killed indiscriminately, both the religious and non-religious, whenever they perceived a challenge to their authority. Stenger argues that Hitler was not an atheist and that Nazi ideology vis-&agrave;-vis Jews was rooted in the soil of Christian anti-Semitism. Finally, Stenger observes that it is not the number of victims that is relevant (as this depends in part on the technologies of war available), but rather the number of perpetrators of the atrocities; there have been many more religious perpetrators of violence than atheistic ones throughout history.Stenger is especially effective in dealing with issues related to his primary areas of expertise: physics and cosmology. He challenges the claim, made by some theists and critics of the NAs in arguing for divine creation, that the universe had a beginning in a singularity. Stenger remarks that there is no solid scientific basis for this notion, one which even Stephen Hawking, to which the idea is frequently attributed, has explicitly repudiated. On the contrary, Stenger maintains that the universe probably had no beginning. Stenger's critique of the popular theistic argument to design from the apparent fine-tuning of the constants of physics is unparalleled in the atheistic literature, which is not surprising given that he has dealt with this issue extensively over the past decade in his books and articles.Stenger also provides an insightful analysis of recent sociological studies that demonstrate a negative correlation between markers of societal health and religiosity. Indeed, some of the happiest and healthiest nations in the world are also the least religious, thus undermining the claim that religion is necessary for societal health. He further notes that there is nothing inherently dismal about an atheistic worldview, and that a life free from the fetters of religion can be lived with happiness and fulfillment. While atheism cannot compete with the self-centered allure of eternal life promised by many religions, knowing that life is transient and that this is the only one we will ever have makes it all the more precious. As Stenger comments, "...new atheists are not trying to take away the comfort of faith. We are trying to show that life is much more comfortable without it." (p. 17). While the appeal of a godless worldview might be questioned by someone living in abject conditions without basic necessities, and without the security and benefits of a modern society offering social services such as healthcare, Stenger makes a good case for the virtues of a naturalistic worldview.In the interest of offering a "fair and balanced" review, I am obligated to note also where I feel the book is deficient. First, the NA contention that religious moderates are inadvertent accomplices in the crimes committed by religious fundamentalists is not entirely persuasive, given that many religious moderates are explicit in their rejection of literal interpretations of scripture and are vocal opponents of fundamentalist views. This is not to say that the NAs are necessarily wrong on this point, but I feel this argument needed further elaboration. Second, in his book, The God Delusion, Dawkins' characterization of early religious indoctrination as `child abuse' raises some important and difficult questions that deserved greater consideration. Indeed, if Dawkins is right, should religious indoctrination at home be banned by law? Needless to say, this issue has profound implications for religious liberty. Finally, I found Stenger's defense of Richard Dawkins' main argument against the existence of God, as presented in his book, The God Delusion, to be a bit too quick and his dismissal of the objections to it premature. In particular, Stenger's rebuttal to Thomas Crean's critique of The God Delusion appears to overlook a key component of Dawkins' main argument. Dawkins goes beyond simply arguing that God is complex and therefore also requires a designer, ad infinitum. Indeed, if this were the case, then Dawkins' argument would amount to little more than a restatement of David Hume's argument from his Dialogues, which simply shows the failure of the traditional argument for design. Dawkins goes further and claims that not only is God complex, but he is improbable. As Dawkins writes, "However statistically improbable the entity you seek to explain by invoking a designer, the designer himself has got to be at least as improbable (p.114)... any God capable of designing a universe, carefully and foresightfully tuned to lead to our evolution, must be a supremely complex and improbable entity who needs an even bigger explanation than the one he is supposed to provide (p. 147)...a God capable of designing a universe, or anything else, would have to be complex and statistically improbable." (p. 153). Along with Dennett, Dawkins considers his "Argument from Improbability", the lynchpin of The God Delusion, to be "unrebuttable". However, as Christian philosopher Alvin Plantinga remarks in his review of Dawkins' book (The Dawkins Confusion), Dawkins does not provide a rigorous definition of "complexity", nor does he demonstrate a necessary connection between complexity and improbability. Furthermore, the assessment of statistical improbability is only meaningful relative to a background context or set of underlying laws, which are absent in the case of God, since he is supposed to be an ultimate explanation. Plantinga's criticisms of Dawkins' argument have been echoed by other theists and by some atheists as well (e.g., see blogs of Bradley Monton and Alejandro Satz). To my knowledge, neither Dawkins nor any of the other NAs have yet provided convincing replies to these critiques (this is not to say, however, that these criticisms are unanswerable, or that Plantinga's review does not suffer from flaws of its own). Nevertheless, it is important to note that the failure of Dawkins' argument would in no way undermine the case for atheism, as supported by other arguments such as the argument from evil and gratuitous suffering, in addition to those presented in Stenger's book, which stand on their own merit. Notwithstanding these minor shortcomings, The New Atheism represents one of the most lucid and persuasive defenses of a naturalistic worldview to date and a powerful endorsement of science and reason as the only reliable means we have for understanding the universe and our place within it.Yonatan Fishman

$review_text.: The Arrangement Vol. 13 ARC ReviewTo say that the latest installment of &#8220;The Arrangement&#8221; series will leave you emotionally shattered is an understatement. The sex scenes are HOT with welcomed insight into both Avery&#8217;s and Sean&#8217;s mindsets. There are more glimpses into the (possible) memories Sean is trying to keep hidden and, just like Avery, you&#8217;re dying for him to finally open up and exercise his demons. The danger element is still very real and prevalent and it doesn&#8217;t appear that our ill-fated couple are in for their &#8220;happily ever after&#8221; any time soon. Just when one situation seems to be in hand, another pops up to continue the angst and turmoil. Will Sean&#8217;s history drive Avery away? Is Miss Black friend or foe? Is Avery strong enough to hear what Sean has been trying to tell her? In true H.M. Ward fashion, the ending cliffhanger will blindside you and leave you with many more questions that the following blank pages just do not answer&#8230; only taunt of the possibilities.

$REVIEW.: Red Cells is set in the world of Punktown and stars recurring character Jeremy Stake. I've never read any previous Punktown works so was worried that I would be lost, but Jeffrey Thomas does a great job of setting the stage so that even the uninitiated can jump right in.Red Cells is a dystopian sci-fi story, a prison drama, a mystery, and a horror story.  There are so many elements at work here that the result could easily be muddled, but Red Cells hangs together despite all the disparate parts. For me the ending felt a little rushed but this didn't detract from my overall enjoyment.I am eager to read more Punktown stories. Mr. Thomas has done a great job of world building and the possibilities seem endless.

Fred Stoller is that ubiquitous character actor you see on so many TV shows but can never remember their name.  This story follows the year he had a reoccuring role on Seinfeld in 1994 due to a chance meeting with Larry David.  It is a good inside look at the show and Stoller's life as he tries to make it as an actor and comedien.

I love her down to earth approach and the great photos of key poses. I crack this big book open to plan sequences for my classes, refer to the smoothie recipe, or do my own practice. This book also turned me on to Teeki pants, which are my new favorite.Most recently the morning after too much wine, I tried the poses she listed to cure hangovers along with a couple glasses of coconut water.  I added the headache and digestion poses for good measure. No need for ibuprofen or lying in bed all day - I felt so much better and was able to move on with my day!

$REVIEW.: I like that Hawke presents a "Survival List" for language acquisition, which is great for beginners, those who need to learn the basics of a language fast, or those looking to develop an individual curriculum. It is helping me organize my ideas for an integrated curriculum, for sure.I hate the lack of hierarchal organization.Example: Pronouns should be (but are not in this book) strictly organized by Person (first, second, third) and number (singular [inclusive, exclusive], plural [inclusive, exclusive]) CONSISTENTLY throughout the categories of nominative, accusative, possessive & demonstrative possessive, and demonstrative by count concept (no-, any-, some-, every-) and impersonal location.They don't necessarily need to be labeled that way, but having them organized that way is helpful, for the sake of consistency. Seeing as how this is a professionally published book and not some free PDF pamphlet, I did expect consistent organization, formatting, and presentation.All in all, though, this is an effective springboard for those looking for a template to be customized independently. While it is by no means comprehensive, and was not meant to be, it's a great starting point. Unfortunately, depending on the target language, some sections of this book are moot, needing to be further personalized. For Romance and certain Teutonic languages, this template can be very useful. However, many languages will not fit easily into this format. Each language has its idiosyncrasies.TL;DR: This book is a haphazardly organized generic springboard with errors, but it does the job helping organize a useful approach to language acquisition.

$REVIEW.: William Rivers Pitt concisely lays out the facts about Iraq.  He offers a brief history of Iraq in the 20th century, showing how the US has played an enormous part in creating the problems in the Middle East that we now face.  He interviews former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter who discusses the weapons situation in Iraq as it is, not as it is imagined by people who fabricate stories for war-mongering.This book has come out at a vital time and must be circulated among the American people and Congress.  Look, we want a safe, secure country and a peaceful world.  This book lays out why an invasion of Iraq will only increase the United States risk of terrorist attacks and will destabilize the middle east making threat of nuclear war an awful possibility.A safer, more peaceful world-- a world we can love to live in will never come about so long as people believe the solution lies in weaponry and bombs.  Get the UN inspectors back in there and engage Iraq diplomatically.Create people to people ties.Please read this book and then pass it on.

Martie is anticipating how wonderful her birthday party will be when she learns that her mother is gone. Her mother's best friend cautions her against contacting the police. All that is left for the girl to find out what really happened is an old drawing and a name she doesn't recognize. The author does a good job of bringing her characters to life and keeping the suspense going about the mother's disappearance. There are two more books in the series.

However, with time, Mirsad has truly found his voice and the information has gotten better than ever. What I think makes the Mistakes Series so interesting is that it's a great blend of science and common sense and...Mirsad.Yes, the author's personality shines here. He does get a little direct with the audience in this book, so if you're offended easily this might not be the book for you. But do me a favor, customer-to-be: give it a chance. See it through. When we talk about the nature of health and the mess of a food supply that we all have to share, sometimes strong words come out. He doesn't swear or get carried away, but you can tell Mirsad is definitely passionate.Check this one out. For less than a bowl of soup at the local neighborhood restaurant, you could be closer to really and honestly feeling better. Don't miss out.

BushmanProvo, Utah: FARMS, 1994

122-33The title of Inventing Mormonism arouses expectations that are not actually realized in the reading of the book
Latter-day Saints use verbs like revealed or restored to explain how Mormonism came about
The word inventing implies that somebody concocted Mormonism; it was made up by an inventor of religion

The name of Wesley Walters as second author increases the expectation that the book will tell how Joseph Smith invented his visions, the doctrines, the Book of Mormon&#56210;&#56869; whole story

Walters's 1969 Dialogue essay on the Palmyra revival had concluded with the thought that Joseph got mixed up about the date of the revival?saying it was 1819-20 rather than 1824 when the records all say it happened?because he was fabricating the story of the vision


The logical extension of this line of attack would be to discover more contradictions between the "tradition" that Joseph made up about himself and the facts of the "historical record." The tone of the book would be iconoclastic, skeptical, and argumentative, and the book would expose Joseph Smith in the act of inventing the Mormon religion.If Wesley Walters had not died in 1990, the book might have taken that tack


Walters had a debater's temperament

He loved to take on an opponent's proposition and score points against it


A mild-mannered, courteous explication of historical documents would not have been to his taste

Michael Marquardt writes in another spirit
He makes no effort to show Joseph making up Mormonism

Marquardt claims only that "as the documents reveal, some events differed from what has been traditionally taught." He explicitly refuses to say Joseph was a charlatan: "we have long since abandoned the simple prophet-fraud dichotomy that others still find so compelling


Our intent is to understand, not to debunk" (p
197)


Marquardt rejects the conscious-fraud hypothesis; in his opinion Joseph was sincere

"Smith believed that he spoke with supernatural beings, and he produced impressive transcripts of interviews with them


Whether he actually did is ultimately a matter of faith" (pp

197-98).Marquardt and Walters have searched the archives for thirty years looking for documents related to Joseph Smith's story of his evolution from farm boy to prophet
In that time, they have dug up a lot of material, not elaborate new reminiscences, but tiny fragments, like Joseph Smith, Sr.'s, name on a Palmyra road tax list
These small clues can be helpful, especially when there are questions about the exact location of the family at a given time


Since Joseph Smith looms so large today, we want to know everything about him
For the early years before he stepped into his public role, these tiny details are especially valuable
The authors deserve full credit for their arduous search and for adding new material to the record of Joseph Smith.The chief target of Marquardt's and Walters's analysis is the story Joseph wrote about his early life in 1838, the familiar account now found in the Pearl of Great Price


In their prologue, the authors quote the story in its unedited form up through the first meeting with the messenger at Cumorah in 1823
Although Marquardt and Walters deal with events through the fall of 1830, they highlight this account of the early years as the core of the "tradition" against which they wish to compare the "historical record."[...]

$REVIEW.: First off Bounty of Love is a better book


I first visited Alaska in 1979 and have lived here since 1997

I am not sure whether the author has ever been here, but lets say he has
The book refers to Seward as a suburb of Anchorage, however it is 127 miles away


If Mac lives there he has a long commute to Anchorage on a dangerous road

Hiline Lake and lodge exist

I seriously doubt Mac and Brad could see a sky full of stars from their Hiline cabin porch in the summer, Vega becomes visible in Anchorage in early August
I also doubt they would sit on their porch in the late fall unless they enjoy being cold


Most snow in Fairbanks and Anchorage falls straight down and it is usually the thaws that bring strong southerly winds

The blizzard the book describes is possible, but would be more likely on the Arctic coast

I owned a plane and the radio for talking to controllers was like 118.7MHz
The story uses Channel 16.1, whatever that is (CB?)

On one of the trips Mac contacts Anchorage approach control and is told to take a heading of 589


Since there are only 360 degrees on a compass that would be difficult
I suppose you could do a 360 plus 229 degrees, but you might end up with a citation
I wish the book had been better researched.

$review_text.: When I come upon a detective inspired murder mystery. I compare every one of them my personal favorite mystery writer - James Patterson. When Tonya pushed this book at me, I was reluctant to say the least.It was brought to my attention that we were getting the EXCLUSIVE on this book. Which is HUGE for us, it's a first. So I had to read it.I managed to read it within a few hours. Topping out at around 300 pages, I was so captivated that I was almost late for work! Then as my color client was processing, I had my nose back in my iPad trying to figure out the mystery.Jarrod Granger IS the next Alex Cross. I really don't think I need to say much more than that. W. S. Greer, I hope is going to turn this into a series and bring me more Jarrod & Marcus. They can be a great team when they aren't butting heads. I hope I get to see more of their fun times.While this book is mostly murder mystery, there IS a romance story to it. And a good one. This is one of those books that I put off and put off and put off until the last absolute minute to read, and how I WISH I would have opened it up the first day I got it.Props to Greer for an amazing debut!!!

$review_text.: Criminal psychology and profiling are my areas of biggest interest in the realm of true crime. As I have a library of over 50 books on this and related topics I certainly feel qualified to write reviews on these books.This book is devided into two parts. The first is a collection eleven odd articles from various bulletins and law enforcement magazines. Put simply, as the book tiltles them, this is a collection of the well known Original Behavioural Science Articles on Criminal Profiling. They are written by the 'who's who' from the era often referred to as 'The Golden Age of Profilers'. For this reason alone the book is well worth 'the price of admission.'Part two covers comtemporary articles on Criminal Profiling. The topices are wide and varied covering such topics as Forensic Linguistics, Geographic Profiling to Assaultive Eye Injury and Enucleation.I wondered how interested I would be in Forensic Linguistics but found the chapter facinating.I feel most readers with an interest in the topic will find part one just great. In part two, since it covers such a wide range of areas I guess it's possible the odd chapter may not appearl to all.The other plus here is the fact the book is broken into distinct articles by the editors so you can 'peice read' or do a 'cover to cover'.I see the book as appealing to law inforcemnet personel, people like myself who don't work in law inforcement but have to deal with perpitrators and their victims and finally all those who enjoy the topic.If I were forced to give up my entire library and keep just one book this would nearly have to be the one.A great book, well done to Campbell and DeNevi, the editors.

$REVIEW.: The beginning of the book left me feeling as though I needed to read the previous books first to understand what was going on. It felt like the author just picked up from where the last book must have left off, and not giving enough detail to give someone who didn't read the last book a clue a connection with this H & H. The events did not flow and it just was the same recurring theme- H & H misunderstand one another and the heroine acts like a spoiled brat. The H & H jump from one second being pissed off with one another, and the next second they're all over each other. I forced myself to skim through the second half of the book just to get to the end, which was as disappointing as the beginning. This last chapter leaves you wondering if you missed the chapter before it and then leaves you flat. It felt like the author got tired and just wanted to end it.

$REVIEW.: David Williams has gone in-depth into the story of "the Other South," to use Carl Degler's phrase in his history of the same name.  As this implies, Williams is not the first to raise this issue, but few have pursued it to this length.  The post-war image of the Solid South was created by the same coercive propaganda which led the Secession movement in 1860.A few criticisms:  When he writes on page 11 that "the Civil War did not begin at Fort Sumter . . . or even between North and South [but] as a war between southerners themselves," he overlooks Bleeding Kansas in the 1850s, where civil war truly first erupted, and which was in large part fought between northern and southern settlers.On page 111 he states: "Most southerners were hardly eager to fight.  Had they been so, no draft would have been needed to force them. . . . 'the power which wealth always gives has been brought to bear most heavily upon the poorer classes.' "  The same could be said word-for-word for northern opinion as well, the difference being that entrenched patriotism always works better for those defending an older state than those creating a new one.  Williams is correct in spotting this distinction between Union and Confederate patriotism.On page 13 he says that for poor whites "freedom meant little without opportunities for economic improvement."  But in a slave society, with much frontier elbow room, it meant more: the right to move around in the freedom of woods and wilderness, which Williams acknowledges as crucial for "Tory" guerrilla operations.  This horizontal mobility also explains the difficulty in promoting collective action among poor whites, and their descendants' propensity for free-market ideas.It's interesting to speculate whether Lincoln's wiser course would have been to let the "Secesh" temporarily have their way, while feeding dissent and insurrection behind their lines - the "Reagan option."  If so, much blood and bitterness would have been avoided, during and after the war.  Conversely, the "secesh cause" would have been better served by a guerrilla war, with public alienation turned toward Federal occupiers, rather than cultivating heroic poses of rhetorical independence and military might which it could not sustain.  The logistical problems Williams details were a reflection of the Confederacy's larger ideology, impractical for defeating a modern conventional army on its own terms.Overall, this is a necessary rexamination of American social history.  Couple this with studies of northern draft rioters and Copperheads, and the complex mosaic of real civil war America returns to life over the dusty tropes of pop culture.

$review_text.: There was a time, not all that long ago, when NASCAR drivers were the prototypes for heavy partying and &#34;socializing&#34; among the opposite sex, while consuming jaw-dropping quantities of one of the South's greatest illicit beverages. If the Bad Boys School had a headmaster, his name was Curtis Turner. But that was only five nights a week. The rest of the time, he had no respect for your position on the race track. Either move over or be moved. Curtis was also one of the first stock drivers to own an airplane; suffice to say the Federal Aviation Administration wasn't the policing powerhouse in the 1960s that it is now. While being one of the powerhouses behind the construction of Charlotte Motor Speedway, which was to rival Daytona as racing's number one venue, he also ran a timber business, and made womanizing at an exhausting pace (for a normal man) a minor career. But Curtis won races and he won championships, and you really need to read the terrific research job author Robert Edelstein in putting this book together. This may be the only race driver I never met, who has deserved two biographies, and I thoroughly enjoyed both.

$REVIEW.: I read Chasing Paradise as soon as it became available on Amazon. Let me premise this negative review by saying that my feelings on this book are not indicative of how I feel about Pamela Ann's writing in general. I love her stories and all the other books she's released (I've read them all and look forward to future books). I found Chasing Paradise really disappointing. I can see why the original release was delayed, and really didn't mind the delay, but I was hoping for a better story. I got a few chapters in and realized something was really off. It was terrible.  The story was bad, the grammar was bad, even the characters grated on my nerves. I almost stopped reading and returned for refund when I got to one chapter (really intense scene with Sienna) and the chapter just ended mid sentence. I determined that something was really wrong. With spelling and grammar errors in almost every paragraph I actually commented to my husband "this author has terrible beta readers or the wrong version of the book was uploaded by mistake". Nevertheless, I plowed on and finished the book in a few hours.  Before writing my review I figured I'd check Pamela's facebook page to see if my suspicion was correct when I saw it was confirmed that the wrong version had been uploaded.  That made me feel better, but given that the story line itself remained unchanged (according to the author) I can't say I enjoyed this book nor will I enjoy the "clean" version. I really liked Blake in the other books, but his behavior became too much to take in this one. The angst between Blake and Sienna was annoying. Both too immature to have a relationship. The scene between Sienna and Adrianna was the best in the book because it changed the tone (which was desperately needed).  Seriously, it was like the first 50% of this book was just filler. I am glad it ended the way it did, but as one other reviewer mentioned, it could have ended with book 2 with just a few more chapters. I'm still a big fan of Pamela's and really appreciate the speed in which she produces her books, I just felt that Paradise fell short of expectation.

$review_text.: Under the Overpass by Mike Yankoski is the inspiring story of two young men determined to see what it means to be homeless. Mike, a college student, felt deeply convicted about how the church is taking care of the poor in today's world and decided to discover for himself what it really feels like to be homeless in America. With his friend Sam, they took to the streets of five different cities for five months, eating only what they earned playing their guitars, sleeping in homeless shelters, or more often on the streets themselves. They learned the challenges in trying to get enough to eat, the impossibility of remaining clean, and where the safest places to sleep are. By the end of their time on the streets, they had both become cynical and exhausted, and couldn't imagine how some people survive on the streets year after year. The stories about what these young man faced is both inspiring and convicting. Too many times, they were ignored or even harassed by people calling themselves "Christian" and often, when they were at the bottom of their endurance, someone showed them wonderful grace and mercy, demonstrating what truly needs to be the church's duty toward the homeless. At the end of the book, Mike offers readers advice as to how we, as Christians, should react and respond to the homeless in our communities. Gift cards or certificates are a better choice than cash, to ensure that the money is used toward food, toiletries, or clothing as opposed to drugs or alcohol. He suggests buying a meal from a restaurant and sitting down and sharing it with a homeless person, to find out who they really are. He and Sam discovered on some days the greatest gift someone could give them was just to acknowledge that they weren't invisible, by listening to them talk or even just by smiling. There is much today's church can learn from this book in how we can serve the poor and needy. Jesus said in his time on earth that the poor would always be among us; Mike reminds us that it's time we started to truly do something to help.

$REVIEW.: I read Just One Song and Just One Week in one day but I have to say there was an issue with this book that definitely brought the rating down.This book is about Mia who you met in Just One Song as Nicole's best friend and sister of the heart and Chase, the drummer in Zach Walters band. These two have been hooking up with a no strings attached friends with benefits relationship but it is no longer enough for Chase.Mia is a very confused young woman and has been through some trauma in her life that shaped her idea of relationships,,,and not for the good. She keeps secrets and hurts others in the process. Then she has a major health scare that rocks her world as she faces surgery and the unknown. She has kept this from Chase and her friends and is determined to go it alone. She does not want to be a burden and affect the lives of others with her illness as her mother's health battle did.ALERT...SPOILER AHEAD! Stop reading if you don't want a few facts about why this author and this book was disappointing to me.Chase is in love with Mia and wants to be with her always but she draws him in and then pushes him away, fighting to protect him from her health scare and what she feels is an avoidable future that she thinks wrecked her family. Here is where the book failed for me. Chase gave her his undying love and promised he would never ever stop chasing her, trying to win her over. But then he lets his head think all kinds of stupid, untrue stuff and decided to hook up with someone he just met, to move on and leave Mia behind!!! Is that true love? Is this what you do to the woman you love more than your life? What in the heck happened to the man who swore she was IT for him? Where is that gentle giant of a man who told her just weeks ago, while she was recovering from surgery, that he would never stop trying to win her over? What is it about men who can't seem to keep there package locked up for a short amount of time when they are in love with someone else...who, by the way...is at her brothers home recuperating from a major life altering surgery. This was the ruination of this story for me. The Chase we knew and learned to love would never do this to her. It just brought him down in my books. Please understand, she had asked him to leave her. She felt she and the illness would destroy him like she thought it did to her father. So he left and even though the band was on tour, he went a couple of months without going to see. He has chartered jets for things much less important but not to go to her. This man was crazy insane for her and he wants a hook up to make him forget Mia, even if it is only for a few hours. This hook-up ended up not happening but it was very close. It also hurt me to know he broke his big rule of not ever kissing a fan on the mouth. He broke his promise to himself for this hook up. Gosh I cannot tell you how upsetting it was and apparently I am not the only reviewer that feels this way. It diminished the story and his love for her. I was close to wishing someone else would come along in her life. Even though she fought him and the relationship, she deserved more. I would not have been able to trust him again no matter how much he said he loved me.

$REVIEW.: I've read this book, and agree with it completely. The reason I do is that I have personally witnessed and experienced the black skin privilege that is described in the book. I have seen people promoted solely based on their minority status and not based on their individual ability or accomplishments. I have seen minority managers give special treatment (as in double standards) to minority workers and promote them over white workers. I've seen minority workers get away with unprofessional behavior that is not tolerated with white workers.I've experienced the anti-white, pro-minority racism in the public school system, in the military, in the private sector, in the media, and in society. This is not a recent occurrence but has been going on for decades. I have no respect for the minorities who knowingly take advantage of this privilege, nor do I respect the guilt-ridden whites who try to justify it. I also don't respect the media, private-sector companies, or government organizations who promote this racial privilege. I do respect equal opportunity (which Affirmative Action is not), equal standards applied to all, and equal treatment and protection under the law for all. This book hits the nail right on the head in regards to the reality  of what is really happening in American society. These skin privileges don't really benefit the minorities either, because a doubt (along with usually a resentment) usually is placed on minorities who are allowed in to universities and get promoted to jobs based on their race instead of their individual talents, capabilities, and performances. It doesn't benefit society in general when the standards are lowered so minorities can be promoted. I'd prefer to have a doctor treating me who had to be able to meet a high standard of ability, competence, and performance than be treated by a doctor who was allowed to be a doctor due to a system of lower standards applied to him or her because he or she is a minority.This anti-white pro-minority discrimination is all part of the Cultural Marxist plan to undermine American society and transform it into a Marxist society. I've read several of David Horowitz's books and I feel he hits the bullseye dead center on each book he has written. Cultural Marxists divide people into tribes (as in racial groups) instead of focusing on individual talents, abilities, and responsibilities. Focusing on groups is a collectivist thought that is typical of Marxist philosophy. There are two films that I've seen that I'd recommend anyone to watch. They are "Agenda" by Curtis Bowers, and "Runaway Slave" by C.L. Bryant. Both of these films address Cultural Marxism and what it is doing to American Society, and these films fit right in to what David Horowitz (and others) are talking about in their writings.

$review_text.: In this work, renowned fiction author Diana Paxson tackles practical rune-uses in magic, divination, and ritual.  The book is obviously intended to be a sort of popular guide rather than a more serious piece.  While there are places where the book misses the mark, there are places where it is fairly good as well.  It is a good introduction to more serious works but it is not, by itself, a complete guide.First the good:I appreciate the fact that the author provides a fair bit of structure in her approach to runestave meanings.  This is an important step which is missing from many books on the subject.  This is important because it helps individuals make up their own minds and arrive at personal synthesis in this area.  Some of the discussions of how to run a study group are helpful as well.I also appreciated the fact that the rune poems were given in the original languages with inline translations.  This helps to encourage individuals to think about the poems as being in their original languages and hence try to investigate their own translations.  When I do a second edition of "The Serpent and the Eagle," I will probably follow that approach.Now the bad:As the author points out, the Runes are a cultural expression of a specific set of people at a specific point in time. Unfortunately she then compares spiritual systems to foreign food and suggests that we can mix and match as we find it helpful with very little structure.  Much of the approach from that point on ends up much more reminiscent of Hermeticism and related traditions and there is a clear Wiccan influence.  (Among other things she refers to menstrual blood as "moon blood" without noting that Germanic languages and traditions see the Moon as a male mythological figure.)  This is unfortunate because it provides a shallower approach to the tradition as a whole.A second problem occurs with the treatment of the Old Icelandic Rune Poem.  The original sources include two sets of material not covered in this book.  The first is a set of glosses in Latin (Aurum for Fe, Umbre for Ur, Saturnus for Thurs, etc).  Often times, the investigation of these glosses provides important material for understanding the Runes.  In some cases, this can be very interesting.  For example As is glossed as "Jupiter" and Naudh is glossed as "opera" (meaning "work").The second set of material omitted are the listings of leader titles alliterating with the stave name.  Once again, these can be quite important to understanding the staves.Additionally I think there is some merit to the criticism of the bibliography, which is robust in some areas, lacking in some parts, and way off in left field in others (a substantial number of contemporary fiction works by the author and others appear there).My other complaints are mild and not really the author's fault.  The pages are printed on off-white paper which is designed to make the book thicker than necessary.  The font is made larger than necessary.  There are white space issues with the first page.  Really the book design looks like it was done either to make the book appear more substantial than it is, and the book design seems remarkably amateurish for a publisher like Weiser.  The cover mentions the author's fictional works which are really unrelated to the current book.  If you are a book design nerd, you won't be able to stand this book.Overall:I think this book is alright in its proper context.  Certainly if someone wants to get into the Runes from a Wiccan background this book and "A Practical Guide to the Runes" by Lisa Peschal are good choices.  However, it is not a serious textbook and is not meant to be.  I would recommend it to some people but not others, hence a 3 star rating.

$review_text.: I received a copy of this book from NetGalley. My thanks to the publisher, author, and NetGalley. This review is cross posted on my blog.I will admit that I have a unabashed love for romance involving time travel. It is one of my favorite romance genres when done well, and this story does it well.Ted is a man recovering from a tragic loss. He is a bit lost, but not completely broken. He has his moments of angst (which considering the depth of his losses is completely understandable), but he hasn't let his tragedy overtake his life, and he even let it inspire him to make some big changes in his life.The setting was interesting, and the theater sounds amazing. I like how the time travel worked, and that there wasn't any big, or complicated mechanism worked out. I like the simple mystery of it.I really like Jem. It was nice to see how strong he was, and that being a prostitute didn't mean he weak, or a victim. I also liked how the historical aspects weren't romanticized, or glossed over. The reality of the city, and the danger faced by men like Ted added to the feeling of the story. I like how the poem was worked in, and how despite Jem's background he wasn't presented as stupid in any way.The romance is well done, and I like the connection that the two share goes beyond the simply physical. The comfort, and the strength they find in each other is really nice. It made everything for me that much sexier. The ending was well done, and made me happy. A perfect winter read.

$REVIEW.: Let me start off by saying that I don't normally read these types of books
 Wow, what have I been missing?  This book was fantastic!  It was fun and heartwarming

 I was afraid the main character, Alice, was going to be this wimpy girl
 Although she had reason to be, she wasn't at all

 And oh, what to say about Noah?  He had my heart beating a little faster through most of the book
 He was smokin'!  The other characters in the book were funny and well written
 You don't see that all the time

 Never having been on a cruise before, I was trying to get a grasp on the setting
 I thought it was funny how Noah kept talking(or thinking) about the gaudy carpeting


 This is the first book I've read by Tiffany Allee and I'm definitely looking forward to more!  Can't wait for this sequel!

$review_text.: It is very easy to get polarized with this kind of books and go to the extreme of considering the author a very enlightened person or to the other extreme and labeling the author with ugly names


The issue is very complex and simple answers are probably not correct
For example, is Reason an absolute that exists out there or is it only a state of being working inside humans? Is 1 + 1 = 2 an absolute or is it true only on limited circumstances? For example, if you mix one gallon each of different liquids you don't always get two gallons


If you invest twice the effort in something most of the time the results are not twice as good, etc

Sure, in the mathematical, abstract, cold case, 1 + 1 equals 2, but in many real instances in life it does not and thus Reason and its constructions might be totally unsuitable for comprehending God, the Soul, creating values, experiencing bliss, and..
achieving eternal life.I seem to come from the opposite direction as Mr


Baker

I started as a firm atheist who thought the Bible was nothing more than the writings of some ancient people from a certain part of the planet and that it was at the most literature, nothing more

I actually felt sorry for all the religious persons
Up to this day I still find some comfort in books like Mr


Barker's as one part of myself cannot conceive defeat after 30 years as an atheist..

and yet now I know that the Bible is true to a degree our reasonable mind can't conceive (much to my chagrin).In order to develop spiritually, we must not worship Reason
We should use it as a tool in life, but not trust it for the ultimate questions

If we don't transcend Reason, then we may follow the fate of Mr


Barker.Most religious persons feel very insecure about what they believe and thus are not prepared to read or discuss a book like &quot;Losing Faith in Faith&quot;.Most of the arguments in favor of religion are just words, clever use of logic, but no substance
If somebody wants to confront a real heavy-weight with respect to religion, I would recommend Emanuel Swedenborg and in particular his book Heaven and Hell


If after reading him with open mind you are still an atheist, then please contact me, I might need your advice.

$review_text.: Belle Chasse by William H. Lovejoy is a 316 page mystery thriller. It is written in third person. It has twenty chapters, no chapter titles just numbers. It also includes reviews from several of Lovejoy&#8217;s other books, a two chapter excerpt from his book, Now You Don&#8217;t, and a short author bio. Lovejoy has quite an impressive list of more than two dozen technothriller, political thriller and mystery novels.The writing sucked me in from the very first few pages and held my attention all the way to the end of the book. This is no cookie cutter mystery here, it is a complex thriller that will keep you turning the pages and guessing. The characters are intriguing, varied and smart. I really enjoyed the banter. The dialogue was spot on for their characters and really added to the feel of the book. Excellent read.

$review_text.: This book is written for those who are toying with the idea of triathlon but have little gremlins lurking in the corners of their minds who whisper "you can't do that because you're not good enough" for whatever reason

 This is not the final word on how to train for and execute a competitive triathlon
 This is the boost to get you out of your puffy cushion chair and on down the road to try and keep trying
 It has cleared up a few mysteries for me about what to expect as I am a rank novice, it has pointed me in the direction of some further training to suit my needs, it has made me laugh out loud and it has given me the major motivating concept that if Jayne Williams can do it then I can do it too!  It is well written and is mostly relevant to 2013 in the midwest with a few changes in technologies and regional differences that are mostly meaningless.

$review_text.: I love the Butterfly Effect-like premise of The Future of Us. If you could glimpse your future would you change it, could you?The Setting:So, Josh and Emma are your typical American suburbanites and best buddy next door neighbors. They get a peek at their futures via a rogue AOL CD and are part fascinated / part freaked the hell out. Needless to say, they try to meddle with their future selves (wouldn't you, a little?) to disastrous/fantastic results.My only problem with the setup was the initial mishandling of the very thing I that drew me to The Future of Us in the first place: reminiscing about the 90's. You know (maybe): hair scrunchies, Walkmans, Seattle grunge, dial up modems... Well, it seemed like Asher and Macker wiki'd "1996" and then clumsily shoved in every reference that popped up. They could have used 90's contemporary books (The Secret Circle series comes to mind) if they were looking for a way to set their novel in the 90's without it sticking out in a distracting way.They didn't actually write "Emma grabbed her Walkman, put in her 'Jagged Little Pill' CD, thought about how Alainis Morrisette was so amazing, set her VCR to tape ER and Friends, remembered that she and Josh were supposed to go see Independence Day this weekend,  and yelled "Show me the money!" at the top of her lungs before she took off for her run."But, really, it was almost exactly like that...With that annoyance aside, I really enjoyed them coming to terms with their future selves and how that information affected their present actions.The Peeps:Josh is a pretty solid citizen and is the voice of reason during all of the meta-physical craziness. Emma on the other hand, is a whiny pain in the butt. I don't want to spoil it for you, but she can't help but keep fiddling with her future self, usually to her detriment. I was kind of hoping she would mess it up to the point that she ended up in Antarctica studying/annoying penguins, away from the rest of the human race (sorry penguins, better you than us.)Final Thoughts:I did enjoy The Future of Us and it's not like I want those hours of my life back or anything, but be forewarned that it is a little bit of a tongue-in-cheek look at the nineties and whether you would change your future if you could.

$review_text.: I don't usually review the books I read, but this series needs it.I have read a lot of new books in the past year, but The Sorcerer Path Series is by far the best.  It has all the characteristics to draw you in and keep you looking for the next book in the series to be released.  I'm not going to go in to too many details but I suggest to anyone who is reading this review that they give it a look.  All the books are incredibly under priced in my opinion, I would easily be willing to pay twice as much for them.

$REVIEW.: This book is based on biblical traditions for magic in the old testament, some part is boring and complicated to read and there is nothing esotheric about it.Some part is more easy to understand but I found the stories complicated and not inspiring at all. The stories are all based upon biblical roles and traditions good for a religous person that want to learn about the magic aspect of the bible. But I think it was a boring book, not very magic.

$REVIEW.: Revoyr's Southland was one of those books that as soon as your eyes absorbed the final sentence, you felt a particular sorrow and a small shred of guilt for being voracious in your reading. For the time spent between it's covers, the reader is locked in the roller coaster ride of it's characters - the ebb and flow of emotions, the tiring yet exhilirating journey of self discovery and awareness of family. Racial tensions, family secrets, the sheer horror that could be trapped within the human soul - all made for the backdrop of this novel, and all manage to draw the reader further into the juxtaposition of Los Angeles in the sixties and early nineties. Each central figure becomes real and vivid, breathing and weaving his or her own story of sorrow and triumph, love and hardship. Each is familiar, and therefore the reader follows the untangling of the central intrigue of Southland with intense interest and concern. The L.A. painted within it's pages is painfully reproduced, harsh and yet with promises struggling to come to fruition. In sum total, at it's end, Southland emerges a beautiful story heralding the lives of it's beautiful and none-too-fictitious people.

$review_text.: When I first heard about Fifty Shades of Grey I had no interest in reading it.  Then even more so when I found out that it was based on Twilight fan fiction. I'm not a fan of fan fiction at all.  I also didn't like what I was hearing from people and the press. For those unclear Ms. James did not start the genre.For a few months I went back and forth deciding if I was gonna read it. Finally curiosity just got the best of me and I had to see what all the talk was about.  It seems readers either really love this book or really hate it.  I'm in the first group, I loved it and I'm really surprised I loved as much as I did.While there were a few annoying bits (eye rolling and lip biting), it was a very enjoyable read. As for the Twilight factor there were some similarities, but not to the point where I was comparing all through out the book. Once I started I couldn't stop. It was quite addicting. I wasn't a big fan of Anastasia. As characters go she was pretty weak. Christian on the other hand, I found him very interesting. Yes, he's all sorts of messed up but he had me turning the page to see what happened next.  Fifty Shades of Grey is an obsessive read. If you are gonna read this one make sure you have some free time on hands.

$REVIEW.: Fender Bender Blues is such a cute and hilarious story that grabs you right from the first page and keeps you on your toes the entire time. While you reading this you are laughing at some of the antics Rachel does and how she changes things for Craig in a good way. Like most women do we multi task while we drive which a crazy thing to do and this is how the story starts out. Rachel is applying lip gloss to her lips while backing out of her driveway when she crashes into Craig Larsen. Lord have mercy when Rachel gets out of her car she and Craig exchange some words and information and this is where the story really starts to pick up.Rachel thought she was in her dream job but a family crisis changed all that and now Rachel is job surfing for the right dream job. She is doing a pretty bang up job but she is in search for the right job. Craig is a strong business man that owns his own company and is pretty financially sound but a PR mess over his ex-girlfriend has him in the lime light and he is no fan of that. So when he and Rachel have that accident he is none to pleased but what he gets from Rachel is so much more than he bargained or ever dream off.These two have some comical situations between them but the light theme of the story and the romance is just enough to grab you in and hold you there until you finish reading it.What happens when you have a social worker and a workaholic? Want to find out read this book!

$review_text.: In a stunning portrail of the consequences of our choices, Susan May Warren deftly and passionately captures the lives of two young women and the people they love in the pages of Heiress, the first novel in the new Daughters of Fortune series. Two sisters, the daughters of a wealthy newspaperman, who want nothing more than to fulfill their dreams (however different from the other they may be), face choices and make decisions that bring long reaching and sometimes devistating consequences, in their search for love and fulfillment. One sister defies family and society to pursue her heart, only to end up alone in the Montana wilderness. The other sister tries to snatch happiness, and is embroiled in a decades long marriage to a monster. Both sisters fear to face God, knowing that their actions have distanced them from Him. Heiress is a moving story of love, family, betrayal, and ultimately a parable of waiting on God. I greatly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it to anyone in search of a good novel!

The story then continues one month into the past.One again Alton and Mallory are working together on a case, with help from Alton&#8217;s war buddy David. We notice that Alton and Mallory&#8217;s attraction towards each other has flourished since the first novel Nefarious.I also like the flashback from the end of Nefarious, showing how they discovered their mutual affection.

As the voice of the lakers, he essentially was the lakers to millions of fans. He brought the team, the coaches, and the rest of the organization to the millions of fans. He lived Lakers basketball, and it showed in the way he talked.This book presents Chick in two ways: One is the writing about Chick, his life, his stories of the team, people, and life in general. Second is the CD included with the book that gives some of his greatest calles, along with narration by Al Michaels. Normally the voice of a sports broadcaster is a transient thing. You hear what he said, or maybe you miss it, and it's gone forever. Here are some of the best of his work, recorded forever.

$REVIEW.: Chocolate chip cookies are a favorite among many.  But why settle for just plain old chocolate chip cookies?  Why not spice things up with some pumpkin, peanut butter, or oatmeal?  Here are 25 recipes for different kinds of chocolate chip cookies that will have your mouth watering.I love chocolate chip cookies, so when I saw this book was available for free as a kindle download, it only made sense for me to get it.  I am not entirely sure how I feel about using an ebook reader for a cookbook.  I often want my recipes in the kitchen with me, and there is no way I would use my kindle in the kitchen, and run the risk of getting food or liquid on it.  So that means either copying the recipe down, or running to and from another room to read it from my kindle.  Neither method seems efficient, and I think I personally would rather have a cookbook in my hands.  Who cares if it gets some stains on it?As far as the recipes go, many of them sound good, and are variations of old favorite recipes.  I have yet to try any of them out, so I cannot speak to whether the ingredient measurement proportions or baking times are accurate or in need of fine tuning.  The pumpkin ones sound amazing, and I may try that one out sometime soon.All in all, not a bad little cookbook, but certainly not my delivery method of choice.

$REVIEW.: Once again the editing made for tough reading
 The plot moves along gracefully and the characters are great


 All that said there were places where some common Spell Check errors marred the reading


 I enjoyed the book but the many places where I had to reread or guess at the right word made the book frustrating to me
 I would recommend it to others but place a caveat that they must be ready to &#34;interpret&#34; some text.

$review_text.: This book is a good resource. It does not have plans, so if that's what you're looking for don't bother with this book. What this book does have is a lot of great information on the building of sheds, design ideas, building options, etc. The author goes through the steps to build a foundation, framing, roof, even ideas on internal storage and external finishes. The text is easy to follow and understand. There are many sidebars that give tips and advice which most laymen probably wouldn't have considered. The photographs are great quality too. This is a great book and I'd recommend it highly for anyone needing or interested in building a shed.

Each and every story in this collection delivers that lovely little chill up your spine!I was lucky to come across this collection when it was being offered for free but I would have gladly paid the posted price for it

I've paid far more for collections that weren't half as good.If you are a fan of horror, don't hesitate

$review_text.: I love Civil war era novels, so I was excited to jump right into this one.  However, I wasn't quite expecting the LITERAL jump RIGHT into it.  The novel starts out so abruptly with some "he sees her" and "she sees him" type scenes but it does this IMMEDIATELY, without even really introducing the characters and building up the story.  The whole first 1/3 of the book seemed totally blocky and I had a real hard time continuing the novel.But then it decidedly got better and the middle and ending were fine. I just can't recommend it because the first third of the book felt like a bad Hallmark movie! That being said, I am giving it three stars because I did enjoy the rest of the book, albeit it wasn't tippy top notch writing there either.  Good plot, good story, bad execution.

$REVIEW.: I veyr much enjoyed this fine text.  Much like the .NET Framework, the book's focus is on applications development for the Web, so a lot in the vein of classical software engineering takes place...which the authors note may confuse current ASP devs skilled largely in VBScript.  And yes, there are few working examples which can be &quot;plugged in&quot; to sites, but that's the point.The emphasis here is on describing the .NET Framework for what it is...a developmental blueprint...not to provide a bunch of predetermined samples to plug into your own site.  There's where the application of the coding concepts comes into place.  I would also recommend Sams' &quot;Teach Yourself ASP.NET in 21 Days&quot; as a primer for the less-experienced programmers...such as current ASP devs or non-coders.On that level, in contrast to other &quot;Beginning...&quot; series books by Wrox, the text assumes a fluency in HTML enough that most of the samples aren't fully coded out...only the important subroutines, functions, and ASP.NET server controls that call them.  So this definetly isn't for the beginner who would like the entire thing explained from line 1 to line N.  A fair degree of expertise is assumed.I did like how the book covered C# adequately (something the aforementioned Sams text sorely left out), and mirrored the majority of the coding constructs in VB.NET with C# and JScript.NET likenesses.  You'll come away with a succint knowledge of all 3 langauges...enough to get you started.All in all, a fantastic job....a real challenge...but well worth it!

$REVIEW.: This book, to me, read a little like Tara Janzen or Julie Anne Walker and Jennifer Crusie had a baby book together, but it was still in its infancy.  The book had a hot alpha male lead. A humourous and truly likable female lead who had issues and was open about them. There were times when the plot was really engaging emotionally, and times when laughing out loud was called for.The attraction between the two was solid but not the falling in love part.  It may stem from the author not fully developing the male lead.  He comes with a lot of issues (Warning - sort of spoiler): PTSD, survivors guilt, and a slight but not curable case of alphahole-ness, which he wears well. What could have been expanded in the book was why he fell for her.  There was a lot of the female lead's perspective into his personality, and why it worked with her neuroses, but not so much from the male perspective.But that doesn't really take much away from a book that is definitely re-readable.  It's really thisclose to five stars.
$SUMMARY.: Not a TKO but definitely worth the read.

$REVIEW.: Resisting Velocity is the story of rock star Zane Alexander.  Zane is the lead singer of the band High Velocity and he and his band mates are wolves.  Zane is wildly attracted to Charlie Banks, his head of security.  Charlie acknowledges the mutual attraction, but she doesn't want to be another notch on the womanizer's bed post.  Zane is beside himself when Charlie decides to quit her job and seeks to find a way to keep her by his side.I really liked the characters in the story.  They are all fun, sexy, and witty.  Although Zane is certainly the Alpha and leader of the pack all of the characters are strong.  Aside from the main characters I really like Benji with his quiet strength and his kind heart.  Parker, another member of the band, is the slightly obnoxious and egotistical lovable jerk.There were a few editing mistakes that I noticed while reading that I hope are addressed in the future.  Another issue I had was that when I was really getting into a scene, sometimes it would abruptly change, leaving me just a tad bewildered.  Aside from those few issues, the authors provided the reader with a fast -paced, and fun read.After reading the first book in the series I realized that there are some aspects that need some tweaking.  However, I really do love the love the concept of the story.  The authors left me anxious to see what happens to the other members of the band, and would be happy to give the next book a try!**Reviewed by Teresa D. for VampireRomanceBooks.com**

I don't think there is a better resource out there for getting a new author ready to take on book signings (the thought of which was really intimidating me). The book covers other appearances too, like Television. I have now survived my first television appearance, and found that Patricia is right on in her advice. Aside from press kits and book signing info, the book is full of great suggestions, ideas and resource references.The information is interesting, well organized and easy to read.

This all changes when an English stranger comes to town and  who is pointed to the direction of her father's shop, which is on their property.Her faith in GOD helps her find answers to her questions and how to make amends to those who love her and whom she loves as well.  When looking for the one last person to make amends to, a blizzard is moving in over Daviess County.Just maybe someone else is looking for answers as to who they are and who they are needing in their life as well.

$REVIEW.: Jack Chabrol is a boy from the wrong side of the tracks, a French Canadian teen new to Bright River Massachusetts. He comes from a large family with a drunken father employed by the mill. This hero in the beginning of this novel is quite likable. He is misunderstood and lonely but gifted with athleticism.Jessica Portman's father owns the Mill and about everything else around Bright River. He is raising two daughters alone and he is very protective of Jessica. He has planned her entire life. Jessica is captivated by Jack though and they have a sweet passionate teen romance. But when Jessica's father discovers the young couple and Jessica's secret everything falls apart for these two love struck teens.Ultimately this novel is about lost love and the opportunity for two lovers to find each other again. Jessica broke Jack's heart and worse kept secrets from him for years. So when Jack returns to Bright River with plenty of cash, he wants revenge against Jessica and her father. At times this novel works very well; Jack's hurt is palpable and raw. The reader understands his pain. Jessica was harder to fathom. Her loyalty to her father was misplaced and she had the power to change her destiny.These leads do not seem to like each other much when they meet in the future. It takes some time for them to be civil and Jack's deep resentment and hurt caused him to lash out more than he needed to with the heroine. I found both these leads to be too secretive with facts and feelings and the heroine especially comes across as too weak to make her own choices.

$REVIEW.: ****I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.****The Boy From the Woods is so much more than a romance - it's a mysterious puzzle waiting to be solved. I love it when I'm reading a book, start developing my own theories as to what's going on, and new ideas start coming to me. It was really cool to enjoy the story while I was taking pieces of the puzzle and working on how everything fit together.I thought the dialogue was witty and well written. I loved the dynamics of Julia's group of friends but didn't fully love Julia herself because she needed more respect for herself. Michael was not worthy of her feelings - they basically had a one night stand because after that night, he stopped talking to her. That's pretty crappy, and that alone would make me want to stay away from him forever. Of course I didn't blame her for saving his life when she found him in the woods - no matter what he had done, I would've helped him, too. She did the right thing, and I respected her for it.I think at first she became intrigued with Michael again because she knew something was different about him. It was so strange that he was released so soon from the hospital after the horrific accident he was in, not to mention his amnesia seemed to have disappeared overnight. Suddenly, he's everywhere Julia is, and it became annoying to be honest. He remembered how he had treated her before the accident, yet it seemed because of his miraculous personality change, he expected her to embrace the new him and forget about the recent past.While I wanted to find out what had happened to him, I can honestly say I didn't want Julia to end up with him. I rooted for Thorsten, her new neighbor. It was kind of odd to me that Julia met Thorsten not long after Michael's accident. I started wondering if they were the same person or something, lol. Thorsten was incredibly understanding though Julia was sending out mixed signals. At least she was honest with him when she told him how confused she felt and wasn't quite over Michael.I wasn't expecting the ending at all and was really happy with the unexpectedness of it. I liked the way the author integrated Celtic beliefs into the story, and I'm looking forward to the next book. This was definitely a different and absorbing story!

$REVIEW.: I went to bed with a headache and planned to just start this novella, but two hours later, my head felt better and it was time to coax my husband to bed.The connection between Lily and Bruno is the strength of this fun, sexy read. They are both well drawn, sympathetic, likable characters.  Lily is successful but full of self-doubt, and Bruno is a savvy businessman with ties to the land and his family that make him far more real and interesting than the average billionaire alpha hero.From the moment they meet, their connection both sizzles and tugs at the reader's heart. Bruno is a perfect gentleman with a sense of humor, and Lily flirts and dishes banter like a pro even with her bruised heart. North packs a ton of promise into their one night together and sent me in search of my own hero, who I met years ago one unexpected night in....

$REVIEW.: I can't say that I have heard any other dramitized New Testament bibles, so I won't say this is the best, but I must say that it is quite an accomplishment. It doesn't replace reading one's Bible, but it is good for someone like me who can sometimes take awhile to read through one of the Gospels. I just found it nice to relax, turn the lights off and listen.The translation used seems pretty close to what I have read in my Bible copy and what I hear at church. Neal McDonough does a fine job as Jesus. Most of the main actors do a good job as either the narrators and characters. However, although I have always enjoyed Sean Astin as an actor his narration of Matthew is possiblly the weakest of the lot. Blair Underwood and Michael York both do a good job narrating and are pleasant to listen too. Malcolm McDowell has that evil quality to his voice and is perfect as Caiaphas. Some of the lesser parts have some questionable voices however. One voice who portrays one of the Zebedee brothers is just awful. It's rather deep and gruff and sounds like an old mountain man and doesn't fit at all. A few of the one word character voices sound like they are spoken at random and don't fit the context. Those are the main complaints I have which are minimal and don't occur very often.The music is done rather well and I didn't find it jarring or overbearing. The sound effects are just there really. I don't know how they came up with them and for me weren't really that important.All in all I think this is a great production using a translation other than, what I believe to be an outdated translation, the King James version of the Bible. I hope that the group that produced this version will now bring us the audio of Old Testament!
$SUMMARY.: Great Accomplishment!

In this inspiring book Eddie Jones uses stories from the lives of General Patton, Walt Disney, Mother Teresa, and Charles Goodyear to show how God directs our dreams. Each chapter uses character traits like humility, perseverance and commitment in showing the reader what it takes to push through those dreams to make them a reality.

$REVIEW.: Interesting story, in a very soft way the author leads you in different directions to find the killer

Your interest doesn't stray, a couple of side plots just like in real life

A sadness to why the killer killed but no real doom and gloom
Just sadness that some one selfish actions hurt the wrong person

We are left with the question in the very end with " was the cold case of Charlotte solved" as this was one of the side plots

I ended this book with a smile.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed the first - SURVIVING PASSION, but for some reason this sequel did not pull me in as well as the first novel.  It's not bad by any means.A lot is happening in this sequel but it seemed the tempo was a lot slower also.  I did not find myself glued to the pages, reading as fast as I can in order to find out what happened next.  In fact, it took several days for me to finish because I would put my Kindle down, read a different book, and then come back to this one.While reading SURVIVING PASSION, I came to care about Dan & Selena.  I wanted them to have their HEA.  I felt involved with what happened to them.  In this sequel, the more I read - the more I could care less about what happened to Dan or what he was feeling.  Selena got tiring.  I understand from SURVIVING PASSION, that this sequel's plot is more about Dan & Selena coming to terms for the feelings that they have for each other and the traumas that occurred in the first novel but it just did not pull me in.  I think the main reason was that while Dan was the macho, strong, (very) silent type having to deal with the fact that he is not invincible, he came across in this novel as a clueless blockhead.  It's one thing to be the silent type - it's another to make decisions and take actions and he trusts nobody except himself to even give a hint till way after the fact?  That he felt the great need to protect Selena but was clueless that she was having panic attacks or had no need to check on her even when he was around? I know that this was central to the theme that Dan was so goal oriented to create a safe haven - a civilization, that he became so focused on that and did not take the time or have the time to learn more about Selena.  In too much of the novel, Selena was only an after-thought to Dan and Selena just dealt with it.The writing is good, no editing mistakes and the world building is effective but for me this is the end of the story.  I have no interest in reading the next book in the series.

I did not know anything about fixed bikes before reading this book, but it has lots of photos and personal descriptions of cyclists who actually ride the bikes (I do not, I bought this book for my son, who likes his fixed-speed bike).I thought that fixed bikes were new, but found out that fixed bikes are not new at all, they have been used for over a century. Fairly impressive speed records have been set on fixed bikes as well, as they appear to be the preferred type of bicycle for velodrome Olympic-style racing.  Overall, a very good book on the subject.  May not appeal to non-cyclists.

$REVIEW.: Of all the C++ books out there, this one best (at least in my experience) strikes the right balance between teaching C++ and teaching OOP. The writing and editing are very polished, showing that it is already a classic that will continue for many more editions. The diagrams are very informative and give clear descriptions of concepts (if you can follow the curvy arrows).He teaches CONCEPTS, TERMINOLOGY, and SYNTAX, all very important to a proper understanding of a complex language like C++. He also makes few assumptions. Lafore doesn't assume, for example, that you know what '&amp;' is for (and it can mean at LEAST three things...).Last but not least, a good value. I've spend $50 for a whole lot less meat.

For the most part, this book seems to beat around the bush by presenting you with a series of actual accounts of clutterers and discussion on why you hoard things and how much better your life would be if you didn't.  The author frequently sites his own experience as a reformed pack rat.  After reading this book, I felt more pumped up to take action than instructed on how to go about better organizing the different facets of my life.  True, motivation is half the battle, but I would have preferred more guidance with the other half.

$REVIEW.: I went to the authors' alma mater, and like them, took a different path.  BJU was anti-Catholic, but these two grads--an Episcopal Federal Judge and Catholic Priest (living near the campus)--are allies, not enemies.  The Reformation is long past, and we Protestants have largely discovered that what unites us in Christ is greater than that which divides us (minor doctrines).  That being said, there is considerable difference of opinion about Mary, and I confess I've never read a book devoted (pun intended) to her.  The title says "debate" but it is more of a cordial dialogue between two good friends.  I found myself thinking that, even though I don't agree with the Catholic position for the most part, their claims are not egregious, and in many cases, once clarified, they don't sound as bad as I'd thought. This is a substantive, extremely well written book that will make you think.  I found a copy at a seminary library and had to have my own copy.  This book needs to stay in print!  Anyone interested in studying Catholic/Protestant differences will benefit from this outstanding discussion.

$REVIEW.: In my review of Vol


1 of The Umbrella Academy: Apocalypse Suite, I stated I thought the world and characters Gerard Way created were fascinating and that the art of Gabriel Ba is great and lends itself to the piece very nicely.For better or for worse, nothing has changed.Gerard Way still has trouble as a storyteller
 He creates an absolutely amazing world of characters and despite all this family turmoil he presents us, I don't really care about any of the characters

 We only get a few snapshots of each relationship, then we are hurried to the next
 It's a shame because the world that Way created has got to be up there in my top 5 through all story mediums (movies, games, books, etc.)  He has this incredible gift for creating very interesting characters and circumstances (Hazel and Cha Cha being one of the standouts this volume) but if you can't make a story that people care about, you don't really have a story
 And killing characters way too quickly (usually comic writers have the exact opposite problem)before we get to know them more, root for them, and enjoy their unique personality.While there are quite a few gems amongst the dialogue but for the most part the dialogue isn't very good
 Many of the lines are very esoteric and self serving, which works for music but not very well in print media.So all that being said I'm still going to continue with the series since it's one of the freshest stories out there, even if it falls short
 Way has some growing to do but considering that The Umbrella Academy is one of his writing ventures published, he's not doing too shabby at all.___________________________What needs to stay the same___________________________- unique world and characters (this is reason alone to buy it)- the art and character design- the mood of the work (macabre and yet amusing)___________________________What needs to change___________________________- killing off characters way too fast before we get a chance to enjoy them- story and dialogue need some work- needs more pathos to keep the reader engagedI look forward to whenever Vol


3 comes out and I hope for those of you wanting something a bit different from your graphic novels (or stories in general), I hope you will give The Umbrella Academy a try.

$review_text.: This is a great scifi book


I enjoyed the first one, but I got fatigued from all the battle scenes in the second half of the book, and the character development was lacking in many regards

This one, however, is much better


It's a great sequel, taking place in another star system (but featuring some of the same characters from the first - Droad, Sarah, Bili, and Fryx)

There's a lot more character development here, less focus on the battle scenes, and overall just a good pace and entertaining story

The ending was slightly rushed but that's ok
It still ended fine.There's obviously going to be at least one more book in this series and I will definitely be buying it!BV Larson is quickly becoming one of my favorite scifi authors, and all of his books are only $3 on Kindle (the four that I've purchased anyways)

Plan to buy many more!

$REVIEW.: The Dart Murders by James Kipling takes you to another thrilling crime spree teeming with mystery, suspense, and anticipation. In the curious town of Amersham, in close proximity to London, three dead bodies are found in different locations, one month apart from each other. What&#8217;s suspicious is that their deaths all fall on the 15th of the month. While it may look like it is the one thing they have in common, the detectives find out that the similarities do not stop there. The murder victims do not only share the same physical attributes, they also share the same (bad) luck in matters of the heart.Chief Inspector Patrick Campbell and his colleagues round up the usual suspects, each one having secrets that could be a motive to the dart killings. The slew of characters introduced in the book only adds to the intrigue and complexity of the case. It&#8217;s one of those stories that gets the reader involved and invested. It&#8217;s a guessing game that&#8217;s hard to win because just when you thought you got the killer pegged, you are proven wrong as the story unfolds. You can&#8217;t help but be immersed in the story, because there is this sense of satisfaction once you think you are getting to the truth.By now, readers of Kipling&#8217;s books have become accustomed to such a thrill ride that they become murder mystery junkies who need a regular dose of serial killer fiction. This time, they&#8217;ll have their fill of Kipling&#8217;s brand of British detective murder mysteries.
$SUMMARY.: A British murder mystery that will keep you guessing

$REVIEW.: I first read Bivin's and Blizzard's book just over 10 years ago. I know this for a fact, because I found a card in my copy of the book from a course I had taken in March 1999. What rekindled my interest in the book was an email exchange I had recently with someone who met Dr. Blizzard 30 years ago or more. The mention of Dr. Blizzard's name stirred my vague memories of his book (I remembered I thought it was good but couldn't recall the exact content) and I realized that it was time to read it again. I'm glad I did. In the past 10 years, I've been progressing with my studies and my spiritual growth, and I am now able to see this text in a more "mature" light. Reading the book again made me realize that this text has something to say both to the mature Messianic believer and to someone just starting down this path.The book's subtitle "New Insights from a Hebraic Perspective" certainly reveals the core intent of Bivin and Blizzard in writing this book. The "difficult words of Jesus" are only difficult if taken out of their 1st Century Hebrew language (and thought) context. As I'm sure most people reading this article know, the Gospels and Epistles were originally written in Koine Greek, or the "common man's" form of the Greek language used during the day of the Apostles. These works written in Koine Greek would reach the largest audience in the then-civilized world. However, it wasn't necessarily the ideal language for expressing the thoughts, ideas, and observations of the writers of the Synoptic Gospels, who were all Jewish and all native Hebrew speakers.Yes, all of the Synoptic Gospels were very likely dictated to native Greek speaking scribes, but the Jewish Israeli people dictating (or perhaps writing the originals in Hebrew and having them then translated into Greek) were using words, syntax, and idiom that were completely 1st Century Hebrew. That is the point of the authors of this book. The message they deliver is that, when we read our English Bibles, we are reading text that was translated from 1st Century Koine Greek into 21st Century English, as if the Gospel writers were native 1st Century Greek speakers. Without taking into account that the Gospels are (in essence) translated from Hebrew to Greek and then from Greek into English (or sometimes from Hebrew to Greek to Latin to English), we are going to misunderstand what the Gospel writers are trying to communicate and worse, what Jesus (Yeshua) was/is trying to communicate. This isn't a casual point for believers who hinge their understanding of their faith on their understanding of their Messiah and Savior.[...]

$review_text.: This was delightful, Ms. Blair got the 'voice' just right.  This is not a full blown novel, in fact, the author says herself it was meant to be a quick little one-shot.  I would certainly buy a full novel and hope she continues writing the character.The story itself reminds me of The Dresden Files, supernatural detective stories with some humor.  My 12-year-old son is about all things mythology, and currently Norse mythology.  With that in mind, there's some 'language' that people might find questionable, and some 'racy' thoughts, but nothing graphic.  I won't have a problem letting him read it.My only complaint is that it ends with a cliffhanger.  Luckily, the next two stories are already available.

$REVIEW.: "A Private Affair" was a great read. Now this book is not for everyone. Especially if you do not care for graphic descriptions of male on male sex.But personally I thought it was a great read. It is the story of Sean Matthews a Private in the military who is married with a young son. Once he gets assigned to a room (in the barracks)with flamboyantly gay Cameron, Sean starts to question his sexuality. First by going to gay clubs, then being attracted to men and desiring them sexually.Sean gets involved in all kinds of freaky sex acts with men, and even gets a stalker. His relationship with his wife is going down the drain. And he is "in lust" with another man, who is also married.Sean must chose what and who he wants in life a man or woman? And he must admit that he is gay and in love with a man.

$review_text.: Stephen Mansfield is a New York Timesbestselling author and a popular speaker who is becoming one of this generation's most respected voices on religion and modern culture. He is also an advisor to leaders around the world, an activist in a variety of social causes and a regular commentator on the FOX and CNN news networks.His latest book, The Mormonization of America is a powerful "mini-history lesson" on the Mormon religion. Each page is backed by up-to-date research, personal anecdotes, and sixteen pages of photographs. Mansfield examines the influence of the LDS church-past, present, and future. He debunks common myths, expounds on the Church's beliefs, and unveils many of the mysteries surrounding this influential religion and its loyal members.For instance did you know that only 2% of America is Mormon? That's roughly the number of people who subscribe to a magazine or who are fans of a hit TV show. In the entire world, there are only about 14 million Mormons. And for most of us, I would say that the Mormons are just one of those things we all know exists, but unless we have sat down to examine it, we are not really sure what they are all about.First of all, they like to be called "Later day Saints" or "LDS" for short. And at the heart of your typical LDS is the idea that their faith is about the restoration of the priesthood.  They literally believe that the LDS franchise is the continuation of the levitical priesthood that began with Aaron.Mansfield spends much of his book discussing the roots of the LDS faith with it's founder Joseph Smith. The organization today would argue that where they are "now" supersedes where they started, but Mansfield disagrees.  The Mormon group is famous for being able to re-write history to fit their needs and so taking a glance back at the "founder of the faith" is a great place to see where the bedrock of this practice stands.  If you'd like an indepth read on Joseph Smith, Mansfield recommends "No Man Knows My Story" by Fawn Brodie.The Mormon boys will tell you that Mormonism was born because the entire church was apostate. No church or Christian was following the true teachings of Christ anymore and so Joseph Smith began to have visions and began to receive word that he would become a prophet and the patriarch a new "American" Christianity.I guess the Mormon church does not recognize the Christians who adopted abandoned children from the Romans, or Telemachus who was martyred when he tried to stop the Roman games. The Mormons don't believe Celtic monks who sheltered the mentally ill or who built hospitals were faithful and they probably don't recognize St Francis of Assisi, or Martin Luther or Isaac Watts or any one of the men and women through Christian history up until Joseph Smith was born in 1805.The LDS faith was given life because Joseph Smith didn't see a righteous church in his little neck of Vermont.  And more than likely Joseph Smith read a work of fiction called "The View of the Hebrews" (which came out in 1825) and he plagiarized it and published it 5 years later as a "Bible" in 1830.The bottom line is no matter how the LDS dresses it up, they are not a Christian faith. They are the epitome of a "cult."A system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular person or object.A relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister.Mormons say that they want to talk to you about the teachings of Jesus Christ, but what they really want to talk to you about is Joseph Smith.Mormons say that the book of Mormon "strengthens" the Bible, but that implies that the bible is weak.But don't take my word for it, or Stephen Mansfield's. Listen to what the LDS founding fathers have to say:"God made Aaron to be the mouthpiece for the children of Israel and he will make me to be a god to you in his stead, and the elders to be a mouth for me, and if you don't like it, you must lump it.""I am not so much a Christian as men suppose I am. When a man undertakes to ride me for a horse, I feel disposed to kick up and throw him off, and ride him."~ Joseph Smith, History of the Church"Every spirit that confesses that Joseph Smith is a prophet, that he lived and died a prophet, and that the book of Mormon is true, is of God, and every spirit that does not is of the Anti-Christ."~ Bringham Young October 1844

$REVIEW.: Sometimes it is fun to just pick up a few short stories to enjoy rather than dive into the depths of longer novels

Michael Brookes' collection is a sort-of continuation to his previous short story collection, as two of the short stories included continue the stories from the previous work

All of the stories are very different from each other and offer a refreshening selection of what I call 'weird tales'


I especially liked 'Not Welcome at the Gate', which allowed us to see what happened to Morlock the Demon after he had been trapped inside a human body.

$REVIEW.: This author definitely knows how to take you for a ride when you read one of her books. This is the second novel I have read from her and I am not disappointed. The cover is beautifully and once you start to read you will be able to tell that it is perfect for the storyline. Each of her characters are perfectly thought out and she writes it with a twist that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. In other words the plot has an amazing flow that will keep the readers continuously entranced in my opinion, I know it did me. This one is has all the awesome features of lots of action, suspense, mystery and maybe a small hint of romance. Mythologies have always been one of my favorite genres to read, so being carried into the battle of the Egyptian gods and goddess fighting in modern day through their children. Mia, who happens to be this archeologist/tomb raider is one woman you want to be on her good side and do not want to cross. She always has been lucky when she goes after what she wants and is extremely loyal to her friends, family, and preserving all things ancient. So when she becomes betrayed by someone who she thought she could trust and the life of her assistant and who she considers as family is put in danger, Mia will do almost anything to get Sophie back! However, not everyone is who they seem in this novel, I loved how the author throughout the book kept throwing the twists and turns because just when I thought I had the person on who betrayed her pinpointed it turned out to be someone totally unexpected. Sides will have to be chosen! This book has become one of my favorite books in this genre and I look forward to reading more by this author.

$REVIEW.: It&#8217;s always good to start a book with some general 101 on what it means to follow this diet, and I appreciate that. When describing the recommended daily intake of carbs, the book gives you choices instead of one stern and easily breakable rule. This book also breaks down other popular diets while explaining what it means to go low-carb. What surprised me about this book is that it made me hungry! No seriously, the recipes sounded good! Almond cheesecake bars? That does not sound low-carb, the name alone sounds like something I would only resort to after two days of crying while only eating raw kale and carrots. And what do you mean broccoli cheese soup is low-carb?? Can you say HUZZAH!?!?! The soup section was easily worth the book price x2.

$review_text.: Esmerelda is a 26-year-old witch who lives with her grandmother in a run-down house. Barely a few paragraphs pass without Esme reminding us she is a witch, but not a very good one.The grandmother is one of two inconsistent characters who exhibits bipolar behaviors and mood changes. Bell seems to think that Esme's observations that the character is inconsistent are sufficient explanation. It's not.The view of magic also suggests bipolar world-building. On the one hand, Esme's context magic rests on the principle that if a person changes one element of an environment, the outcome can change. Staying calm and alert are elements of that. Duh. Esme's perpetual whining about her life is blamed for the series of unfortunate events that ensure -- until the real cause comes out of left field at the end.On the other hand, there is an almost cartoonish view of magic as an inexplicable something that can produce outrageous phenomenon that are not apparent to non-magical people in the vicinity.Even though the story is short and an easy read, Esme gives us all-too-periodic plot recaps, as if we might forget what we had read only a few pages earlier.I'd have to write a Spoiler Alert to tell why the plot outcome is so unsatisfying; suffice it to say that it is as if the grandmother had a lobotomy to make it work.Homonym misspellings and missing words are among the typos that need to be fixed. I finished the story; in retrospect, I'm not sure why I bothered.

$review_text.: Keith Scribner, in his debut novel &quot;The Good Life&quot;, does an admirable job with his entry into the American anthology of fictionalized true crime.  It's a risky undertaking, attempting to lift sordid truth into inspiring fiction, but Scribner has firm control over his subjects, and injects his ready made plot with keen insight and incisive social commentary.&quot;The Good Life&quot; is based on a New Jersey kidnapping case from the 1990s, in which a middle aged couple, in a stunning and tremendously incompetent caper, kidapped a highly placed executive at a Fortune 500 firm.  It was a cautionary tale of the times, pitting the disappointment and rage of those in American society whose dreams far outstripped their talents, against the smugness and arrogance of those the system rewards.In Scribner's novel, Theo and Coleen Wolkoviak's lives have evolved into a catalogue of failures.  They're unemployed, overdrawn, and living with his father, realizing all the time that they are aging into irrelevance at forty five. The one thing neither of them ever seems short on is fantasy.  They've applied their talent for hyperbole and outright fabrication to a great variety of entreprenurial efforts, all to the end of achieving the things that are owed to them.  What they &quot;deserve.&quot;Stona Brown is everything they aspire to be.  He has arrived in his career, in his marriage, in his own self image.  His arrogance knows no bounds, and the sureness of his life, wealth and principles is inviolate.  Until one day when his wife spies a strange woman in a pink jogging suit skulking around the foot of the driveway at an odd hour.  The ordeal that follows becomes a battle for Stona Brown's life and soul.The book is a real page turner.  Some of the characterizations and language seem stilted and unreal, but as the book unfolds it seems that this is a canny calculation on the author's part--his characters are as bankrupt and empty as the language they think in.  Scribner does a great job of buttressing his social exmamination by adopting a writing style which blends right into the lives and the environments he's describing.Whether or not a reader is familiar with the case on which &quot;A Good Life&quot; is based, it will leave one with a new sense of what is valuable.

$REVIEW.: What aggressive capitalism has always taught is that it is ruthlessness (often accompanied by the hard hearted deception and immorality, or inhumanity) that determines the winner in a game of winner take all - the one that equates with being a sole survivor. Above all, it make be the distinction of why most women do not succeed, and why they reach a point where morality and integrity are not worth sacrificing - for the win. For women who are able to yield, or are so ambitious that winning is everything, they tend to exist among the more predatory alpha males who reside among us, often doing quite well, it seems. Often characterized as the pirannas they are, however, they are also mocked by men for using the same methods, and inconsistent with the attributes that have been traditionally favored by men (and by women) as attractive and acceptable. But if women prefer not to be alone, why would they use these tactics to be a "sole" survivor. In fact, why would men want to be a "sole" survivor in the form of lone wolves when mankind lives a "community life?" Disassociation is not normal or healthy, and may be one of the greatest flaws of aggressive capitalism, that encourages the predatory nature of men, or of women. Harmony produces peace, not war and most prefer to live peaceful lives of pleasurable pursuits.

Despite her age, Lyv possesses a maturity to know what she wants out of life and is determined to find her place in the world. When the unthinkable happens and she finds herself wrenched from those few people she loves and trusts, she must put her life back together and figure out where her real priorities lie.Alexander is a rock singer on the verge of hitting the big time. When he and Lyv meet at a club, there is an instant attraction and the two begin a brief courtship. Alexander leaves to go on tour and Lyv goes missing, can love win out when it seems that everything is working against them? How will Xander, as he&#8217;s known on stage, react once he finds out the cause of Lyv&#8217;s disappearance?Ten, Lyv&#8217;s best friend, comes from money and privilege; he and Lyv make a very unlikely pair, but it is with Ten&#8217;s help that Lyv is able to get back on her feet once she makes her way back to New York. But when Xander has trouble coming to grips with the domestic lifestyle that Lyv is craving, Ten has a proposal that Lyv couldn&#8217;t possibly refuse.Lyv is so desperate for love and positive attention that when Alexander walks into her life, she is quickly smitten, despite the lack of guarantees that come with rising rock star lifestyle. On the other hand, she has Ten, the best friend that has been her shoulder to lean on when it came to her mother, as well as the ups and downs of her brief relationship with Xander. Is there more to the relationship between Lyv and Ten than they are willing to admit, or even understand?Ripped is a fast, easy, well-written read that can easily be devoured in one sitting. Ms. Rigal has crafted complex characters with relationships that are woven in intricate patterns. The story is heartbreaking, yet inspires so much hope. It is not your typical rock star romance by any means, it is much more than that. My only knock on the book is that I wanted more, it seems that there is so much more that could have been exploration into the story, simply because of the complexity of the characters and the storyline itself.

$review_text.: The first two novels in the Douglas Brodie series were very good noir thrillers - fast-paced, explosive and full of black humour. This one is very different and takes the Brodie series to another and much darker level.Brodie is asked to investigate a spate of burglaries in Glasgow's post-war Jewish community. But when the burglar is found murdered it gradually becomes clear that there is a connection that leads back to the horrors of the concentration camps - horrors that Brodie has been trying to forget since his role as interrogator of war criminals after the war.Ferris handles this dark and difficult subject with a great deal of sensitivity and humanity. The details he gives of some of the dreadful acts that were carried out in the camps are kept to the minimum necessary for the development of the story - Ferris carefully avoids the use of gratuitous detail. Instead he concentrates on how these events are still affecting his characters, including a very moving portrayal of what we would now call post-traumatic stress disorder. As I read, I couldn't help but think of the men of my father's generation, the ones who came back - a generation who mainly bottled up their feelings about their war experiences, who talked of the camaraderie of war but not the horrors, and I felt that in some way Ferris was giving these men a voice that the stiff-upper-lip culture of the time had perhaps denied them.But although the subject matter means that this book is much darker than the previous ones, this is also a first-rate, tightly plotted thriller - well-paced, plenty of action and still with room for occasional flashes of humour. Brodie's relationship with Sam is developed further and Danny McRae, hero of Ferris' other series, plays a part in this one too. In a previous review, I compared Gordon Ferris to Ian Rankin. This book leads me to compare him to Reginald Hill, an author who could give his readers intelligently light entertainment in one book then take them to the darkest places of the human soul in the next. I've thoroughly enjoyed all of the Brodie books but this one also moved me deeply - highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Arthur Levine is an author who savors the exploration of relationships and spirituality, and his fiction displays always come with fascinating results."Sequin Boy and Cindy" is at its core a love story between Billy Wolk and Cindy. They meet in New York as young adults, both on the verge of financial destitution, but as most young couples do, they place the priority on their relationship and somehow manage to make a go of things for a while. Unfortunately, life and New York's high cost of living finally force them both to take the drastic measure of joining the military. The young couple goes to war.Now I could talk about the tongue-in-cheek way that the author carries us through a lifetime of challenges which include debilitating war injuries, charitable causes, civic duty and so much more, but I think the important thing to say is that through the prism of lives built on love, dreams and faith in each other, these two amazing characters teach us how to journey to our passions while also remembering to love and care for the important people around us at the same time.I urge everyone to spend time with "Sequin Boy and Cindy" if only to see how brilliantly Arthur Levine manages to weave Native American spiritual beliefs throughout this ever-evolving love story.

$review_text.: I absolutely loved this book. By its quality it reminded me of the best works by Terry Pratchett, but it is definitely NOT an imitation of books written by the great master of humoristic fantasy. "That darn squid god" has its own, quite unique style and is different from any other humoristic/fantastic book I ever read until now. Here are the reasons for which I consider it as a "must read" position:1. The heroes:- Professor Felix Einstein, a perfect British gentlemen of certain age, widower living alone with his only daughter and three Bengal tigers, financially comfortable, erudite holding numerous diplomas, polyglot, well versed into arts of the occult, excellent shooter, member of almost every secret club and society in existence and above all an obsessive-compulsive, maniacal and totally unscrupulous collector of rarest world (and even universe...) artefacts, which earned him the reputation of THE most redoubtable grave-robber of the planet;- Lord Benjamin Carstairs, a perfect (although slightly oversized) young British aristocrat, terminally blond, six foot eight inches tall, weighing 20 stones (all muscle), single, wealthy, erudite, polyglot, well versed into the arts of the occult, excellent shooter (most favourite weapon - an elephant gun...), member of many most exclusive clubs of London high society, great hunter, war hero, a great collector of rarest world artefacts, which earned him a reputation of one of the most notorious defilers of holy relics in the world (second only to a certain Professor...)- Mary Einstein, daughter of Professor Einstein, a perfect young British lady, beautiful (and redhead), brilliant, educated, fearless, knowing perfectly how to curtsy, serve tea, talk about weather and slay by any means available (broom, butcher knife, revolver, dynamite, bear trap, bare hands, teeth) the innumerable evil cultists who search revenge on her dad for defiling their temples; also the romantic interest of Lord Carstairs- That Darn Squid God, a perfect example of eons old deity from another dimension, gargantuan sized, invulnerably invincible (and invincibly invulnerable), infinitely evil, abominable above description, abjectly tentacular, infinitely gluttonous, permanently aggravated, perversely sadistic, maniacally jealous, devilishly vain and abysmally cheap to friends on their birthdays; assisted by a horde of fanatically devoted depraved (and so low class...) human minions operating from a network of secret keeps around the world (and out of this world...); after four thousands years of deathlike sleep in its watery grave situated both in this and an alternative universe, now that the stars (and especially the moon) above our planet are right it is ready to wake up again and rule the world (which mostly means eat all its inhabitants, beginning with little orphans...); all resemblance to Cthulhu is absolutely intentional... oh, and it is also a real hoot...)))2. The story - it is very well conceived, with many surprises and twists but ultimately rather linear, very logical (no rabbits out of the hat), in fact if the tone was not deliberately humoristic, it could be an excellent "serious" horror/fantasy book in itself; the atmosphere of Victorian times such as presented in Arthur Conan Doyle and Julius Verne books is perfectly imitated and me for one I felt at the end I really would like to remind myself the old classics like "The lost world", The children of Captain Grant" or "The chase of the Golden Meteor". There are also other "classical" influences detectable in this book: Edgar Rice Burroughs, Henry Rider Haggard and of course H.P.Lovecraft.3. The style - this being a humoristic fantastic book the comparison with Terry Pratchett works is unavoidable; personally I found it different but at least as good as "Discworld" series and in some aspects even better (although I may be also a little bit tired of Pratchett's books as I read them all...); to my personal taste "That Darn Squid God" is sometimes better than "Discworld" series in a very special way it describes England, its traditional institutions and its inhabitants; it certainly finds many funny things to say about everything mentioned above - but its humour is much less vitriolic and anarchic than Pratchett's; in fact there is a deep tenderness in author's irreverent humour and even a little bit of nostalgia; it is even more visible in the chapters when our heroes must investigate in Vatican; many a lesser author would use this opportunity to deliver a rabid anti-Catholic salvo - but here the unavoidable jokes about the pope, the cardinals, the Swiss guards, the priests, the nuns and the most secret Vatican Archives are simply clever and funny (believe me, you will never perceive the nuns in the same way after reading this book) but without being tipped in poison.4. The research and history modifications - authors also display quite a knowledge of both XIX century and modern weaponry and know how to describe chases, fights and even ranged battles. Victorian British Army is the target of many clever jokes and one-liners but it is also treated with some pride and admiration. Last but not least, authors also amended a little bit the history timeline in their book, and for that reason this story occurs in a kind of parallel XIX century world, almost the same as ours but with one exception - the worldwide Troubles, which occurred some 10 to 12 years before "That Darn Squid God" begins... The Troubles are important to the story, but please, try not to look out what they were - you will learn it sometime before the "Great finale" of the book and if you figure out too early what they were, it would lessen your pleasure...In conclusion, I can only encourage you to discover this very funny and very pleasant book! Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: Patrick Henry Reardon has written an interesting book describing the human aspects of Christ.  It is a well documented and cited work that should leave many readers intrigued. The book was aimed more at the academic than the lay reader in my opinion, including a lot of research into the characteristics and nature of Jesus Christ.Every aspect of the childhood of Jesus portrayed in the Scriptures is reiterated and elaborated on by Reardon. From the lost story in Jerusalem to the wedding at Cana, the author discusses the implications these words of Scripture have on Christ's humanity.  Other chapters include His baptism by John, Jesus at prayer, Jesus and the women, and His resurrection finalizes the book.What is interesting to me is how clearly Jesus' humanity is conveyed in the Scriptures.  He is always spoken of and referes to Himself as a man.  Yet we also see where Jesus so clearly declared to be God that the religious elite of the time picked up stones to kill Him on the spot without even a trial or dragging Him to the gates of the city where this sort of thing was usually done. It is awesome how God came to earth in the body of a man named Jesus the Christ specifically to redeem us back from our sinful ways!All-in-all the book is well written, documented well, and does not skimp on adding additional notes. He references a lot of christological counsels that have occurred throughout the ages, incorporating them as appropriate. It is clear to me that he sees the oneness of God, even if he does not affirm it.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.

$review_text.: birmingham's book on james joyce it is a complex and painstaking reconstruction of the european literary scene at the top of the 20th century

it is so well crafted, a reader gets a sense of the streets joyce walked in ireland and italy, his colleagues, his love nora barnacle and the many enemies of his work


birmingham has a masterful use of adjective and phrase that bring everyone in this story to vivid life in the reader's mind
this is the type of book that is hard to put aside, even when birmingham takes the reader in to joyce's litany of medical issues


it is here that the text gets very graphic but again--it is wholly readable and very much worth the skin crawling feel given from the text.after finishing this book, i have wondered if i would pick up a novel of joyce's, knowing that i love non fiction more than i love fiction at this point in my life

i think i would like to learn more about joyce first and others in his world, then deal with the prospect of battling through 'ulysses' on my own.that would be battle number two and i would be ready for it by that time!

 This is the first book I have read by Laura Hilton but definitely will not be the last
This book is most assuredly 5 stars


I was drawn into the story from the first sentence


Kristi is injured in an accident and Shane saves her life


 I couldn't wait to see how life would turned out for Kristi Lapp, An Amish midwife, and Shane Zimmerman, an English vet,who fell in love despite the two different lifestyles
This book will have you cheering for Shane and Kristi and then have you booing for Shane and then you will have the same feelings for the Amish elders in this story


This story proves true love wins in the end


 I am hoping there are more stories with Shane and Kristi

IT INVOLVES TOBIAS A DOM WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FROM THE SCENE FOR SOME MONTHS BECAUSE OF HIS HEARTBREAK OVER HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH HIS THEN SUB PHANTOM. ON HIS 41ST BIRTHDAY HE DECEIDED TO GO BACK TO THE S&M CLUB WHERE HE WAS A MEMBER. THE OWNER WAS A CLOSE FRIEND AND THRILLED TO SEE HIM AGAIN. EVERYONE STARED AT TOBIAS AS HE WAS A WELL KNOW AND WELL LIKED DOM. EVEN HIS OLD LOVER AND SUB. PHAN STILL LOVED HIM. NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM BUT LOVED HIM. TOBIAS FELT THE SAME TOWARD PHAN. BRADFORD INTRODUCED TOBIAS TO NOAH, A GOOD LOOKING MAN IN HIS LATE 20'S. BRADFORD TOLD THEM HE THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE GOOD TOGETHER AND LEFT THEM ALONE. NOAH HAD BEEN WITH A FEW MASTERS BUT THEY NEVER SEEMED TO WORK OUT. HE DEFINITLY WAS NOT INTO DEEP PAIN AND CAGES SCARED HIM. IT WAS UP TO TOBIAS TO FIND OUT WHY. HE NOTICED NOAH HAD A SCAR ON HIS SHOULDER AND DECEIDED TO ASK HIM ABOUT IT LATER ON. YOU'LL ENJOY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TOBIAS DISCOVERS NOAH'S FIRST DOM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TORMENT HE FEELS. AFTER STUDYING AND LISTENING TO NOAH HE SAID HE'D TRAIN HIM. NOW ALL NOAH HAD TO DO WAS SIGN A CONTRACT. THROUGH TIME NOAH AND TOBIAS FALL IN LOVE. BECAUSE OF THE CLOSENESS BETWEEN TOBIAS AND PHAN NOAH FEELS THREATENED. HE CALLED PHAN AND ASKED IF THEY COULD MEET. WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE PHAN CALLED TOBIAS TELLING HIM ABOUT NOAH ASKING HIM OUT FOR LUNCH. LATER WHEN NOAH FOUND OUT HE BECAME UPSET. NOAH AND PHAN ENDED UP LIKING EACH OTHER. NOW REMEMBER I SAID LIKED NOT LOVED. I JUST GAVE YOU A SLIGHT INDICATION ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF THIS BOOK. THERE IS SO MANY EXCITING INCIDENTS INSIDE OF THIS MARVELOUS BOOK. I THINK DEVIATIONS: SUBMISSION BY CHRIS OWEN & JODIE PAYNE IS ONE HECK OF A BOOK! AFTER YOU READ THE FIRST IN THIS SERIES YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF BUYING THE SECOND BOOK DEVIATIONS: DOMINATION. YOU'LL ALSO DISCOVER THE SECOND BOOK IS AS ENTERTAINING IF NOT MORE SO THAN THE FIRST. NOW FOR A THIRD BOOK. HUM, NOW THERE'S A GOOD IDEA.

Color of Forgiveness, is about forgiveness, not just for Dylan. Because he does need to forgive himself to find happiness, but for Myra too. Where the first book left us in a major cliffhanger, Myra has to find it in her to forgive Dylan.

Extremely detailed, helpful statistics, and while it is generally pro-diet, it's also realistic in the point that it isn't for everyone. Very worthwhile, I would even venture to say an essential read for someone considering the diet for themselves or a loved one. It made me feel like I have a realistic view of the challenges and possibilities and think it will surely be a reference in the future. Loved the fact that they included a section with recipes, too.

$REVIEW.: Not only is this an excellently researched companion to Shelly's original novel, it is written in a completely complementary voice. While FRANKENSTEIN is written from the Doctor's point of view and details his experience, MONSTER is told from the creature's experience, and details one that in many ways is very different.  Taking the position that the Doctor lied through his teeth in his deathbed confession and storytelling, MONSTER posits that the true beast was Victor himself and the creature nothing more than a victim of the most obscene horrors.While this is not an entirely new concept (THE DRACULA FILES and WICKED both come to mind), Zeltserman does an excellent job with it. His style of prose dovetails well with the original FRANKENSTEIN... and that's is where I begin my critical comments.  For me, as with that original novel, this one suffers a little from that style of prose. There is a slightly distancing effect in that 19th Century diary-style narration that kept me from becoming as emotionally involved with the creature.  Likewise, a decision to involve some clearly supernatural elements diminished things for me; rather than the Doctor being a horrific example of the coldly detached scientist, as I first expected, his villainy is hot, emotional and yes - sorcerous.  Some of the message, warning of the dangers of science without care and morality, are lost.Despite these small complaints, I very much enjoyed the book as a story and as what I take to be a passionate project of the author's. I applaud the excellent use of the original FRANKENSTEIN material and inspiration. MONSTER is an excellent read from a unique crime writer with a tendency towards the bizarre, indulging a personal passion.  Worthwhile!Then, go read Zeltserman's unmatched THE CARETAKER OF LORNE FIELD, to see him really stretch his horror muscles!

$review_text.: The second installment of The Chronicles of Guiamo Durmius Stolo


 At the end of the fist episode our hero has had some basic training but has become increasingly restless and in order to further his quest he signs up to join Caesars army


 His first task is to sail to Britain but on landing Caesars army is unsuccessful and has to abandon his invasion attempt leaving behind Guiamo.The author takes us on a page turning adventure with excellent myths and legends thrown in
 The descriptions and situations are expertly described and you feel is if you are right there fighting and combating the evil spirits, carrying his secret weapons and whispering the spells in order from him to achieve greatness and triumph.This story holds a lot of research and historical facts and the authors knowledge really shines through which holds and captivates the reader into imagining the creatures, people and the way they live and their will to survive.The extraordinary element is having read the first installment I didn't think the follow up was going to be as enthralling or as good but how wrong was I


 I am certainly looking forward with great excitement to the third book.If you love and I mean love a novel which can take you to a time you didn't live in and bring it to life then this story and the author is for you.The writers style of writing is simple and with excellently references in the book to the ancient language used, the plot with mythical creatures with dark secrets will appeal to readers of all ages and especially to those of you who like to read a bedroom story to their children (but be warned you could be reading for a long time).

$REVIEW.: I won a copy of this book during a takeover that Katie did on Crazy Daisy Book Whore on Facebook.Holy all things HOT, STEAMY AND SEXY!!! This short and to the point novella is totally worth 99 price tag. I don't have any person experience with fantasizing about a professor, because all the men who taught at the local college here were old or not very nice to look at. If Tristan Everett was my professor I would let him do very naughty things to me anywhere he wanted.This little novella is filled with steamy, dirty sex. You definitely will get a little hot under the collar while reading it. The characters are very well written also for it being a sexy erotic novella. I really liked Tristan and Mel. I loved the possessive stance that Tristan took towards Mel without even realizing or wanting it to happen. I liked that is was told in the alternating POV so you can get thoughts from both sides. Sometimes female authors don't really capture a male POV and they can sometimes make then too feminine or even make them slip in their personality, but not Miss Devoe. She totally rocks and writing Tristan's sexy dominating character and even when he is so confused as to what he is feeling. She executed his character great. Mels character is pretty awesome too. Smart, sexy woman who has no idea how attractive she is. But Tristan soon drives that home to her and their explosive sexual relationship just might turn into something more...

Even though they were supposedly crazy about each other way back then, he doesn't even recognize her.  She devises a plan to have her revenge on him because of a supposed bet he had with his friends back in high school regarding her big boobs.  When he finally realizes who she is, he devises his own plan for revenge.  Both of their plans were stupid.  I never really understood the bet he supposedly had.  Also, for someone who always hated her big breasts, she sure did seem to throw them out there a lot.  I really got tired of hearing about her big boobs.

$REVIEW.: I had never read Kathy Herman before but I spotted her books on the library shelf when I was looking for another author.  Since mystery/suspense is my favorite genre to read I decided to give her books a try. The first book I checked out was Ever Present Danger.  By the middle of the book it was obvious who the killer was but nevertheless I still enjoyed the book.  I just had to read the next two in the series which was Never Look Back and they did not disappoint me.  Love the surprise twist in the second book.  The third book was The Grand Scheme.  It followed the theme of the Prodigal Son.  Rusty Griffin was the "good son" who did not get into drugs like his sister and when his sister returned and changed her life around he could not get over his resentment that his parents were forgiving and showed mercy to her.  His jealousy was eating him alive.  There was also a man who worked at Elam's company who felt that Elam was showing favoritism by giving his son-in-law the job promotion.  He expressed his jealousy in destructive ways.  I don't want to give too much of the plot away but to say it is worth the read.  Kathy Herman has written several other series so I plan to check those out.  So happy I have found a new author to read.

$review_text.: This is a fun, fast-paced book with an unusual setting and bizarre, well-developed characters. The author uses a somewhat stereotyped style of dialogue for the characters of Strangeville that takes some getting used to, but it is not done in a malicious way. Well worth the price and made me very excited for Part II!

$review_text.: Here is another excellent book that was created as a hardcopy book and then &#34;kind-of&#34; reformatted for the Kindle; which unfortunately is becoming all to common on Amazon.  Writers seem to think it is OK to just quickly, and half-heartedly reformat their &#34;masterpiece&#34; which was written for hardcopy, and just toss it up to sell as a Kindle book.I use the very popular Kindle Paperwhite and every table and diagram in My Story Can Beat Up Your Story: Ten Ways to Toughen Up Your Screenplay was impossible to read.  It is well documented (by Amazon and others) that tables need to be transformed to readable images (jpg format) when formatting for the Kindle, but our very talented author just ignored this &#34;detail&#34;.  So, I did find it, with a touch of irony, that the author was so keen on story telling structure, but could not take the time to format his tables and illustrations in a way that Kindle readers could actually read the tables and diagrams!I was also not very keen on the &#34;homework&#34; assignments taking the reader to the author's website at the end of each and every chapter; and personally would have preferred more examples from a wider variety of screenplays.  I prefer books to be more &#34;self contained&#34; so when I'm reading them on an airplane, on the beach, or having my Subway veggie sandwich that the author does not direct me to his web site at the end of each and every chapter.On a positive note and just like the other reviewers, I greatly enjoyed the authors writing style and found the book to be excellent and highly recommend it, even with the two huge flaws mentioned above.  In my view, this book is great for both writers and non-writers, and I highly recommend this book to everyone.Please authors!  When you create your ebooks, edit them and insure your tables and diagrams are value-added and completely readable for the Kindle. Please! Please! Please!PS: Perhaps Amazon should &#34;tighten-up&#34; their quality standards for Kindle books?
$SUMMARY.: Excellent Book but Diagrams and Tables in Kindle Version Are Nearly Unreadable

$review_text.: How can you not fall in love with Kane? He was absolutely swoon-worthy. I found myself immediately sucked into Breathe into Me from the first chapter. For Amanda Stone being a first time author, this book was amazing. She did a wonderful job and I applaud her.Jessi, Kelsey's best friend, was a hoot, and I even liked Landon even though he wasn't in the book that much.Kane grandparents were so sweet and his grandma reminded me of my own, which had me giggling.I had a lot of trouble putting this book down and the ending took me by surprise (no cliffhanger, it's a standalone, so don't freak out). My jaw dropped and I was like, "Whaaat?"I don't like to give spoilery reviews, because then what's the point of reading the book. So, I just want to say, I think this is one you should definitely check out and get lost in for a while. Amanda writes beautifully and I know I'll be reading her next book.

$review_text.: The story of Jack and Leila continues on the second book of the Back-Up series. And I love Jack even more than I did before. GOD!! That man!!I absolutely loved the first book of this series, and A.M. Madden's writing. I love how the characters developed from book 1 to book 2. The story flows smoothly and once I started it I couldn't put it down.This book picks up right were book 1 left off. That bomb sure rocks their world, but I love how well they handle the situations that were thrown in their path. The story is packed with all kinds of emotions and sometimes I felt like screaming and throwing my kindle against the wall, so many feelingssss!!! But they were so many moments that I was smiling like a fool with so much happiness. And of course with all of them packed up in a tour bus they were many funny moments, pranks, twerking, and so much more. Oh yeah then there are the steamy scenes, holy hell those two were at it like rabbits. So freaking hot!! I love the chemistry they share, those two were meant to be together and the relationship they have is so beautiful.Have I mentioned I love this man??&#8220;You have been a royal pain in the ass.&#8221; Holding my face with both his hands, he kisses my lips softly. &#8220;But you are my royal pain in the ass.&#34; JackThis was funny.

$REVIEW.: Tessa Kahill had grown up abandoned by first her father and then her mother. Foster care had never given her a sense of belonging, but she majored in journalism in college and is highly recognized as a foreign and national T.V. news correspondent. The only person she's ever been close to is her college roommate, Leslie. Leslie had married Tessa's old boyfriend Max, after Tessa had left him to pursue her career. Now, Leslie has died leaving Ryan, Tessa's godchild, motherless, so Tessa goes to help, when Ryan starts having problems at school. Another problem arises in that she's too attracted to Max, but she's afraid he'll always love and grieve for Leslie. Max is attracted to her, too, but he believes she'll just leave again to continue her all-important career.I enjoyed this book much more than I expected. It's hard to find a clean secular romance novel, but this one comes close. It's full of desire, passionate feelings, sizzling chemistry, and even one scene of heavy making out, but no actual sex. And, there's no profanity. I think the story is much stronger because of the building attraction and tension that isn't released. I would give it a 4.5, which rounds up to a five.

$review_text.: Most of the folks here already know that The Walking Dead saga is a compilation of stories by Robert Kirkman that expand on the story that is well know to any zombie movie fan. The main story. The one started in earnest by George Romero in 1968 with Night of the Living Dead [and was later remade in 1990 (the version that I prefer) by Tom Savini (with Romero oversight)].This Walking Dead "Compendium" is a compilation of Volumes 1 through 8 (or call it Books 1 through 4, or call it issues 1 through 48), and it continues the story of (former) Police Officer Rick Grimes and his band of normal-world-refugees across a world suddenly infected by a Walking Dead sickness..The group finds a new home after a perilous Georgia countryside journey at the start of the story only to find out that zombies may be the least of their problem, and what is deemed a safe haven is only as safe as the protection it offers against zombies. Yes...venturing out into The New World is dangerous. Outside the gates of the new home awaits unfathomable chaos and horror; hordes of the undead, along with other survivors in desperate situations that do the unthinkable to stay alive (or entertained).As the story matures, it is much less about zombies and more about what happens to society, its morals, laws and standards when government is lost and the planet becomes mostly uninhabitable. There's real, heartfelt emotion in The Walking Dead series combined with believable scenarios.I'm not a regular comic book reader, but I was drawn to The Walking Dead by the Book releases that bring the convenience of being able to get many chapters of the story without the month to month or volume to volume waiting. And I am now hooked. Now I subscribe to the issue releases.Each chapter of The Walking Dead is like reading a screenplay with storyboards of a version of Night of the Living Dead that began simultaneously, but in a different part of the country. Sure...The Walking Dead is kind of a rip-off of a story (stories) already told, but the key is that it's done very very well. The zombies are true to the original Romero creation: slow and stupid as opposed to the Rage-infected people in28 Weeks Later / 28 Days Later) or the fast zombies in the 2004 remake ofDawn of the Dead.So anyone in need of a very well done zombie fix that you don't put into your DVD player should absolutely get down with The Walking Dead sickness. Add this one to your cart if you're new to The Walking Dead...you won't be disappointed at its length because the story never gets tired.

$REVIEW.: This is the first book in the Starwalker Serials by Lizzy Ford and Julia Crane

They write as a cohesive team through out the who series

You can't even tell that there are two authors at work for each serial.Severed stars two sisters, Tyana and Cyena, from an elite family
One has the most desired trait in their world

The other has two, more subtle, traits


Though they are complete opposites, they share a strong bond
They live a sheltered life, believing that the most difficult thing they will face is being paired off to someone they don't love
Unbeknownst to them, there is a war brewing on the other side of the wall

Their world will soon be rocked apart, forcing them into different planes

They will stop at nothing to find their way back to each other.This novella kicks the series off with a big bang


The characters are relatable and believable
You see the princess, the bully, the one the people look down on, and even a hero or two
It's a breakfast club full of personalities


I can't wait to read the whole set of serials and find out what will happen with the sisters!

$REVIEW.: here's an Under the Tuscan Sun feel to Parker's novel, Kate's Escape from the Billable Hour, with a comedic twist, and a more graceless fall that makes the protagonist less tragically romantic than Diane Lane, but more relatable on a personal level.Kate Billings is a Big Law attorney for the firm Krapp & Lipschitz, L.L.P., whose name is a fitting aptronym for both the senior partners, and the firm's practices. Lured away from her ideals of helping the down-trodden, by the fat paychecks Big Law offers, which will pay off her student debt, Kate discovers that all of her hard work has been for naught. Humiliatingly denied her annual bonus, for reasons that can be described as nothing other than both sexist and abhorrent, Kate makes a dramatic exit from her place of employment in the form of a "Sanity Break".In the best possible way, Parker awkwardly hinges the theme of her book on the question, "Are you happy?" Something Kate refuses to consider and yet, with Bridget Jones' brand of grace and tenacity, she goes after the only thing that has ever made her happy. The fact that it was her family's high school foreign exchange student, never once seems as creepy to her - when she impulsively buys a ticket to Barcelona and leaves without even packing - as it might to any reader over the age of sixteen.The book is a rollercoaster of incredulity, and resonance; ridiculousness, and the kind of absurdity everyone feels when their life is turned upside down. This is what is most successful about Kate's Escape from the Billable Hour - it's relatable. We have all felt underappreciated at work, misunderstood by our families, and as though everything we've done has been useless. We've all longed to break free from that and do something crazy and different, and Kate does what most of us have only dreamed of doing. You want her to succeed, even if you have no idea how she's going to pull it off, you want her to be happy.There is no doubt that Kate's Escape from the Billable Hour is engaging, for all the reasons mentioned above. It's also well written; the pace moves along without ever lagging, or leaving you wondering when things are going to happen. Plot twists abound as well, rounding out what could have been a one-trick pony. This is one of my favorite features. Instead of being a straightforward love story, the book takes great strides to focus on the main character, and her discovery of self. No matter her intent in moving to Barcelona, the journey she takes once she's there becomes something bigger, finally freeing her enough to honestly answer the question that began the story: "Are you happy?"The author has experience in the same field as her main character, and her expertise shines on every page, from her description of billable hours, to (my favorite) the way an attorney divides his or her daily activities into billable increments. Let's hope that she is much happier now.I found "Kate's Escape from the Billable Hour" by Petula Parker to be a highly entertaining read. I look forward to seeing more work from Ms. Parker soon.

$review_text.: This short will feel just like home to fans of the series, and provides just enough of a taste to help tide us over (but keep us hungry) until the next volume arrives. One should read at least the first four books in the series, if not all five, in part because of very slight spoilers, but primarily for the greater depth of background they provide which, in my opinion, is necessary to fully appreciate the story. I've only given this four stars because, for something this short to get five, it needs to be pretty spectacular in and of itself. That being said, it is an excellent piece for those who have read and appreciate the series.

$review_text.: Hand of Fate, the thrilling second installment in the Triple Threat Series, features three best friends who fight to stay at the top of their high profile careers in the most dangerous and heartbreaking of circumstances. As they wrestle with the unknowns in the murder of Talk Radio Host Jim Fate, they are forced to question the actions of everyone around them, even if it means exposing the hidden secrets of one another. The story opens with not only the on-air murder, but with the city-wide panic and evacuation of the downtown Portland area, caused by the crippling fear of poisonous gas in the air. From that moment, the reader shifts from scene to scene, picking up the pieces of Jim Fate's past in the midst of the unforgiving world of live television and radio.A story that shares tidbits of little known information without writing above the head of the reader is a treasure. A part of the action from the start, the reader must sort through the abandoned chaos with each main character, overlooking how the happenings affect them on a personal level. Nicole, Cassidy and Allison are complicated, yet believable; and so is their friendship and struggle to find God in a tough environment.I now care about these characters, and look forward to their future adventures, but even more than this, their growth and deepening friendship. I highly recommend this book, and trust that the pages will keep you on the edge of your seat until the surprising ending.## I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] &lt;[...]> book review bloggers program.

While I didn't really think I would like it that much, after all I'm not a fan of spiders, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed reading the whole book
The Introduction and each chapter begins with a relevant quote, and continues with the most interesting information I can imagine about the world of spiders.The pictures are appropriate to the content and add to the comfortable vibe of the book

The author eases us into the topic reassuring us that spiders are not as scary as many of us believe
While I never will be a lover of the species, I have a much better opinion of them than I did before I read this book
It's an easy to read, informative look at a species that is often misunderstood


I highly recommend you check it out.

Where he just so sensitive, she came across as too hard and Alpha.  But, if it wasn't for her the case would still be closed with no leads.  I couldn't believe how everyone let this police captain berate them. I also could not believe how the female lead couldn't stop having sex with this man, I mean terrible things were happening continuously to her and her family, but these two were getting busy anywhere and everywhere. Her brothers were protective and scary, but in a sweet way. I almost gave this 4 stars bc the female came off as too extreme for me, but the story deserved 5 stars for the suspense, the unexpected twist, and how well the story was written.

$REVIEW.: Grace Divine always knew that something happened the night that Daniel Kalbi disappeared. The night that she found her brother Jude collapsed on the porch and he was covered in his own blood. The memories that her family tried to bury, has resurfaced, but when Daniel returns three years later, the memories start slowly coming back. Despite Grace's promise to Jude that she'll stay away, she can't keep away from Daniel. He has amazing artistic ability that is drawing Grace in, but the closer Grace gets to Daniel, the more she jeopardizes her life. Grace must discover the truth behind the dark secret and the cure that can save the ones she loves. But she may have to lay down the ultimate sacrifice to do it--her soul.Despain creates amazing characters that are unique and have their own personality. I really liked Daniel, he was a great character and swoon-worthy. His mysterious elements helped really bring the story to life. Grace was interesting and really sweet, too. She was a bit naive at times and believed things a bit easier then most people, which annoyed me. Jude was interesting. I liked how Grace and Daniel didn't fall for each at first sight, but they slowly liked one another. I liked how the plot slowly unraveled and had mysterious undertone. It was fairly original and different. Despain wrote beautifully and created such a unique paranormal romance. I would recommend this to people that like paranormal romance or are looking for a book that is a bit different.

It starts out with a married couple, Millie and Brian, their struggles in their relationship and Millie trying to decide if it is worth the effort to try to make her marriage succeed or if it is truly over.  This story of her marriage struggles , raising a teenager and financial problems is one a lot of readers can connect to on some level.  I loved the characters and hated them sometimes for their choices. This book had me hooked, once I started reading it, I couldn't stop, I had to know what was going to happen. I read this book in one day since I couldn't put it down.  Then at the end, OMG what a cliffhanger!  I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the next book in this series to find out what happens next. I have to know what happens. Please Ms. Seidler don't keep us waiting too long.

$REVIEW.: Through the work of Oscar Wilde and E. M. Forster, we see what it must have been like to be a homosexual in England during the Victorian and Edwardian eras.  In Erastes's Standish, we get a fascinating glimpse into gay life in the earlier Regency period.  Unlike the more modern Forster, who had the good sense to keep quiet as to his homosexual "proclivities," Ambrose Standish, like Wilde, finds himself in the clink for crimes of gross indecency.  While at times the plot moves too quickly and the sex is excessive, the key elements of the story seemed quite plausible, making this work of gay, historical fiction a fresh, unique and remarkable read.

$REVIEW.: Got plenty of ideas to make more sales from this book written by a behavioral scientist, you'll learn the three emotions that triggers sales the fastest, also this book give good advice to write ad copy

The fact is our human brain react to psychological triggers, like to be challenged and good copy is when you trigger emotions to make your customers feel happy or frightened


Did you know that after having someone taking a survey it is very smart to give them something, than they are more willing to buy from you the next time you offer them something? You will also find some Scarcity and Urgency triggers but also some key phrases to use in the sales process


A short but interesting book if you are into sales or want to learn more about it

The book is not for you if you are already a good salesman, but guess everyone can find some new ideas in this.

$REVIEW.: Robert Bruce introduces the reader to his concept of the &quot;mind split.&quot;  This mind split is what makes OBE's so seemingly difficult to achieve.  It's not that we don't have them, it's that we don't remember them, and if you don't have the memory, it's as if nothing happened.  He goes on to explain that the projected body carries with it it's own projected mind, and that it is this mind that experiences and remembers all that happened OOB.  The trick is to get this projected mind to down-load the OOB memories to the physical brain on return to the body.  This is the best new idea to help understand OOB's to come along in many years.  This section of his book alone makes the purchase price worthwhile.Unfortunately the rest of the book is not so orginal or interesting.  The style is bland, filled with fuzzy mystical terms, redundancies, and personal experiences that seem a bit contrived.  The book is also overly long because of it's attempt to be an explain-all of the OOB phenomenon.  Someone once said that it takes two to make a great painting; the artist to paint, and someone to tell him when to stop painting.  This goes for writers too.

$review_text.: This is an hilariously entertaining book of an almost impossible sort.For years I've met fulltime hardcore activists full of powerful and colorful stories that I thought I knew would die with them. Most people are tragically and frustratingly allergic to writing anything down. Wilson is an all-out activist, a Gulf Coast shrimper turned civil resister who has made herself a major thorn in the side of several multinational corporations. She's part Forest Gump, part Erin Brokovich, part Daniel Berrigan, and she has put her stories down on paper. Her book is a guide to becoming a one-person justice movement.Wilson has not only lived as a shrimper who experienced the arrival of the polluting chemical companies that would kill off the shrimp, but she has put that experience into context -- and I mean context.So a woman who had struggled to become a shrimper in a man's world became an activist, a resister, a hunger-striker, and an aid to whistleblowers, not to mention an author. Wilson very rapidly developed into the kind of activist who will act immediately upon the wildest idea available. When Union Carbide / Dow was poisoning her corner of Texas, while shortchanging the victims of a disaster the company had caused in India, Wilson scaled a fence, climbed a tower, dropped a banner, and chained herself up. Wilson declared herself an unreasonable woman and announced the need for more of the same. Inevitably, she was involved in launching one of my favorite peace groups, CodePink.One of Wilson's more entertaining stories involves her sneaking into a fundraiser to protest then-Vice President Dick Cheney. Another is when she decides to sink her boat on top of an illegal discharge pipe, the Coast Guard tries to stop her, and a surprising ally takes her side.Wilson's book is part of her activism, exposing the crimes and lies of the corporations she has protested. Her repeated willingness to risk jail leads to some of the best whistleblowing in the book, as she describes the horrors of the Texas penal system.The stories Wilson tells about Union Carbide and Dow and Formosa and BP are worse, far worse. The actions she takes to counter their crimes include single-handedly filling in for the government agencies -- notably the EPA -- that are supposed to enforce laws. Wilson generates media coverage of abuses, educates the public, attempts citizens arrests, and afflicts the comfortable when she can't comfort the afflicted. After organizing a CodePink naked women's protest of BP in Houston, she greeted one of its bought-off senators, Lisa Murkowski, in a Congressional hearing by pouring oil-looking syrup all over herself and denouncing BP's destruction of the Gulf. Then Wilson managed to get back in, to another hearing the same week, to protest BP's then-CEO Tony Hayward with black paint all over her.As Wilson demanded Hayward's arrest through the microphone of world media (and the end of his work running BP would be announced the next day, his departure from the company a month later), Wilson herself was the outlaw under our system of so-called justice. She faced criminal charges in Texas from which she was fleeing, and now in Washington, D.C., as well, but hopped a plane to Taiwan where she would present a Black Planet Award (for destroying part of the planet) to Formosa Plastics, the biggest corporation in Taiwan. The headlines all celebrated "The Woman Who Fights Formosa."The last line of Wilson's book is "Now -- where's that Tony Hayward?"She found him (or his company) last week, with another Black Planet Award, and despite being kept out of BP's shareholders' meeting, helped generate stories around the world about the oil that is still killing the Gulf of Mexico where once upon a time a woman could make a living with a shrimp boat.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed this book about Bill and Kylee's road to finding love. While it was basically your typical romance with Bill having suffered a great tragedy that has turned him against God, I still found that it held my complete interest and never got boring. There was lots of interaction and dialogue between the two (I think I comment on this in all my reviews, but I do not like to read a romance where the hero and heroine seldom have contact or spend page after page on introspection about their past and why they cannot love again, or long descriptions of scenery), and the story moved quickly. Found sentence structure to be good as well--this can sometimes ruin an otherwise great book with short simple sentences that continually begin with "He" or "She". Guess that sounds dumb but surely someone out there feels the same. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a clean romance. However, if you do not like a Christian-themed book then this will probably not be for you. Happy reading and God bless!

$REVIEW.: If you've been fighting dry skin conditions and wrinkles with various expensive creams, lotions and oils, consider that you've been going about it from the wrong side of the equation.  Skin is the largest organ in the body, as author Allison Tannis points out in Chapter One, and is exquisitely sensitive to and a barometer for our nutritional status.In Chapter Two, Tannis gives a quick overview of the structure of skin, the role of keratin, collagen and elastin in preventing wrinkles, and the role of sun exposure in aging.The next six chapters get to the specifics: each chapter is organized around a specific skin complaint to be addressed, the causes of that condition are discussed, followed by detailed descriptions for the various foods recommended to help that particular skin condition. So, for instance, the first of these six chapters deals with wrinkles.  24 various fruits, nuts, vegetables and other categories of foods are listed and WHY each will help is discussed in detail.The six chapter titles organized in this fashion are:Foods That Fight WrinklesFoods That MoisturizeFoods That Tighten, Smooth, and Fight SagFoods That Brighten Your ComplexionFoods That Fight Puffiness and InflammationFoods That Fight Acne and PsoriasisThe last chapter of the book is devoted to a variety of recipes using the recommended foods.  I particularly like some of the unique salad pairings; recipes such as "mango, spinach, sorrel and pistachio salad" and "avacado, grapefruit, pomegranate, and red onion salad" have me trying more adventurous salads, and enjoying the flavors. This isn't an exhaustive recipe book by any means; consider the included recipes as a good place to start on the path to healthier, skin-friendly eating.One final comment: I like the layout and the visuals in this book.  This is the kind of book that you'll go back to as reference and the organization, layout of the text and pictures throughout the book make it easy to thumb back through to find the information you're looking for.

At times I felt I was reading a fiction book because it kept my attention and I kept wanting to read more.  Even though I love flowers, I was surprised that this topic could be so fascinating. It was like reading a NOVA documentary. I have always wondered about some of the magic of flowers and "how do those flowers get in the market".  Simply amazing!!  The author is so thorough to include the socioeconomic factors and the differences in countries. Now I want to go to Amsterdam to see this incredible scientific accomplishment. Thank you, Amy, for writing this book. I recommend it highly....you will learn a great deal by reading this book.

$REVIEW.: I want every person contemplating the purchase of this book to use the "search inside" tool, and click on the copyright page.On that page you will see a box that says "Full Disclosure."  PLEASE, please read it.Dr. Wilens receives grant support from five different drug companies.  In addition, he is a paid presenter for three different drug companies, and a consultant for six different drug companies.While the information contained in this book is exhaustive, as a parent of two children with a multitude of medical and psychological issues, I find it difficult to trust his opinions and "straight talk" when I know that he is making tens of thousands of dollars a year from these drug companies.Would he ever discourage against a particular drug when he is making money from the maker of said drug?  I do not know the answer, but that bit of doubt makes me wonder.Fortunately, in my state, we are able to search online and discover which psychiatrists take money from drug companies, and which do not.  Again, as a parent, am I more likely to trust the psychiatric care of my children to the doctor who takes no money from drug companies, or the doctor who received over $135,000.00 last year as a "consultant" to four different companies?

two opposites but the attraction in INTENSE!The story was phenomenal and I enjoyed it so much!!! I am so use to reading about the hot rock stars that it was nice to have a change of pace with a rapper and country singer

(Don&#8217;t get me wrong though I still love my rock stars)Taryn is going for the image of &#8216;America&#8217;s Sweetheart&#8217; and is BIG right now in the industry


Trace is a man whore who has a different woman every night and is also big but is known for his rapping abilities

Totally different styles of music but signed on at the same label and are put together to collaborate on a single

Sparks fly from the very beginning of their meeting each other (although it wasn&#8217;t the best of circumstances considering he just beat her for an award)


As they begin this journey of making the new single they get to know each other and the passion only grows.I enjoyed how it started out with only little texts to each other

Then eventually it developed into phone calls and soon they went out on a date

(In disguise of course!) I loved watching the development of their relationship


They had trials they had to go through and survive as a couple
Being in the spotlight already makes things difficult but they had other forces that were against them.This started with a slow build of passion until it caught fire and left you blazing! Amazing job and great read!!! Definitely a favorite so far of 2014!

$REVIEW.: Another great story from Jessica Scott!It's interesting that even after a happy ending in Because of You, Shane and Jen still had some issues to smooth over before they can really live happily ever after.Both of them had their own set of fears with regards to each other. Jen, despite her fears, was able to cope with it as much as she could. Shane, on the other hand, was willing to sacrifice everything if it meant having Jen with him for a long time. That kind of dedication and love is truly unconditional.Carponti opened the book, which was such a treat for me :) I still wish that he would get his own book, even a novella one day :)

$REVIEW.: ******I received a copy of in exchange for an honest review.********Nate Peters!! I remember him well Ashton Taylor&#8217;s best friend in &#8220;Nothing Next To Lose&#8221; like Aston he was a sexy bad-ass SWAT agent. Nate was funny loyal, protective, confident, and oh so cocky, and such a player, and a man whore who didn&#8217;t do relationship, and claimed he was never going to fall in love, and so far he was sticking to this plan until he meets Rosie York Anna&#8217;s best friend, and someone who is going to blow that plan right out of the window.Rosie doesn&#8217;t trust men due to a past relationship. She sees Nate for the player that he is. She is immune to his charms, and his cheesy pick up lines something that Nate is certainly not use to.&#8220;I&#8217;m not your type? What the hell does that mean? What wrong with me?&#8221;&#8220;I don&#8217;t go for cocky, overconfident guys that care more about how they look then whether they have something interesting to say. Players just don&#8217;t do it for me&#8221;.Rosie and Nate are cute together, and I like the way that things develop slowly, is was insta attraction, but no insta love here, a friendship that turns into more. Rosie is sweet and doesn't take any crap from Nate. For the first time, Rosie made Nate see that if he really wanted her he would have to prove it. Nate was going to have to use a very different approach a bit of old fashion romance perhaps if he wants to win this girl over.&#8220;Moving from one girl to the next sometimes left me feeling empty. Sometimes I just longed for someone to hold, protect and call my own. Since I'd met Rosie I hadn't been able to get her out of my head, she'd taken over everything and I knew I needed to give it my best shot with her.&#8221;The storyline was a well-written sweet, funny romance. Although it&#8217;s a longer read the drama, and angst is good, and not too over the top. Kristy does throw a few twists along the way. One that I have to say was emotional; tension filled, and had me reaching for the tissues, as I feared the outcome. Told from Nate and Rosie&#8217;s POV. Rosie&#8217;s lets you see her worries, and insecurities, about letting Nate get too close. Love the way Nate thinks, hilarious at times, you could see the changes in him, but the was still the Nate we loved.&#34;I'm not the guy your mom warned you about. Your mom doesn't have this much imagination,&#34; I joked, winking at her.&#8221;Anna and Aston are back, and it was lovely to see what happing in their lives. Nate&#8217;s family was too funny especially his mum. I loved the scenes with them. His mum was the best.Overall I really enjoyed this book it was another one of Kirsty Moseley&#8217;s books that I would recommend, and that I finish with a smile on my face. It had a lovely epilogue that gave me the HEA that I always love in a book. I would recommend this book as Nate Peters is one of those swoon worthy characters you should meet.
$SUMMARY.: **4.5 stars** Nate Peters a swoon worthy characters you should meet.

It's a good cookbook because the ingredients are easy to find, most I already had in my cupboard.  I have planned several more dishes out of the book. I have recommended this to others. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I think there should be more photos of the recipes.

$REVIEW.: Since I'm planning to visit the Atlanta area again later this year, I decided to freshen up on the Battle of Atlanta, and read another account of the Atlanta campaign.  The book I pulled off the shelf, unfortunately, was Wortman's.  The old adage, "you can't judge a book by its cover," rings true again - for despite the book's attractive dust jacket picturing the Battle of Atlanta cyclorama painting, I found Wortman's book terribly disappointing.  The book is overwhelmingly one-sided, at times to the point of absurdity.  (The glowing endorsement on the back cover by James McPherson, modern-day Lincoln-cultist extraordinaire, should have been an early tip-off).There is no shortage of books about Sherman's Atlanta campaign, and it can be challenging for a writer to find something new to discuss when writing about such a well-covered event.  Wortman takes the interesting approach of telling the story from the viewpoint of those who experienced the events, and had he stuck to this premise, would have produced a fine book.  But the author allows his own Northeastern biases and prejudices, and scorn for anything "Southern," to befoul and ruin what could have been a fresh way to tell the Atlanta story.Wortman begins by devoting an early chapter to describing how Georgia was taken from the Creek and Cherokee Indians by unscrupulous white Southerners.  Throughout the remainder of the narrative, the author cannot seem to make it through a single chapter without inserting some snide comment to remind the reader that Georgia was stolen from the Indians (as if his own New England, along with the rest of America, never belonged to Native Americans).It very quickly becomes apparent that the author is literally obsessed with the subject of slavery, and he makes no attempt to conceal his bigotry against - and contempt for - Southerners (as if slavery never existed in his New England, or anywhere else in the world except in the antebellum South).  The American Civil War was, according to Wortman, "a war fought to preserve slavery."  Indeed, in Wortman's mind, the war was only about slavery - ALL about slavery, and nothing but slavery.  There were no other factors, as far as Wortman is concerned.  The first third of the book amounts to little more than a tiresome diatribe about slavery, and throughout the entire book, he scornfully refers to slaves as "human chattel" (a term prevalent in 18th and 19th century abolitionist literature).  In Wortman's world, not only was every white Southerner a slave owner - every white Southerner was Simon Legree.  Wortman never lets the reader forget that the Confederate army used impressed slaves to help build the entrenchments and fortifications around Atlanta.  It becomes almost comical, in that he cannot mention the Confederate defenses without inserting "which were built by impressed slaves," or "slave-built fortifications."  Yes, slaves helped build the Confederate defenses - WE GET IT!  (It's like the 2004 presidential election, when the media couldn't say John Kerry's name without mentioning that he served in Viet Nam: "John Kerry, who served in Viet Nam,...").  Wortman neglects to mention, however, that the federal army treated blacks no better - using former slaves to do the Yankees' own heavy manual labor, or using black troops as cannon fodder to attack unassailable positions.The Yankee soldiers were all fighting to free the slaves, while the Confederate soldiers were all fighting to keep slavery - it's as simple as that to Wortman.  But the book is filled with inconsistencies.  In several passages, he details the terrible hardships (starvation, filth, brutal heat, insects, disease, horrific battle wounds, lack of medical care, etc.) endured by the Confederate troops (or, "soldier(s) for a white man's empire," as the author contemptuously refers to them) while defending Atlanta (and fighting their "war to preserve slavery").  Are we to believe, as Wortman would have us to, that the thousands of poor Southerners who made up the Confederate ranks - men who had never owned a slave in their lives, and who had little concern for the black man, one way or the other - were enduring these unimaginable hardships, sacrificing their appendages, and their very lives, all so that a few rich people could keep their slaves?  By the same token, we're expected to believe that the Yankee soldiers, most of whom were as racist as any Simon Legree, were enduring many of these same hardships just to free the Negro.  This is only one example of how Wortman turns logic on its head.  In another passage, Wortman, talking about the wounded arriving in Atlanta on the trains from the front, describes how the evil southerners (who, thanks to the Yankees, didn't have the resources to care for their own wounded, much less the enemy wounded), callously left the wounded Yanks to writhe and suffer under the Georgia sun.  According to Wortman, anyone, especially blacks, who dared assist the wounded Yankees, would do so at the risk of death at the hands of vengeful Southerners.  Wortman doesn't explain how he reached this conclusion, but he then proceeds to describe how, first one, then an entire group, of black men and women managed to openly render assistance to the wounded Yankees - freely and unmolested by the so-called vengeful Southerners.As previously mentioned, the premise of Wortman's book is the Battle of Atlanta, as seen through the eyes of Atlanta's citizens.  But not surprisingly, most of the Atlantans featured in Wortman's account are those with Northern and/or Unionist sentiments and sympathies.  No Confederates - be they soldiers or citizens - are described honorably or favorably, anywhere in Wortman's book.  To believe Wortman's account, every Confederate was a shirker, a coward, a draft-dodger, a deserter, a simpleton, a thief, a drunk - or some combination of the above.  Moreover, Wortman would have us believe that the Yankee soldiers in Sherman's armies (the true thieves and marauders) were all benevolent freedom fighters, engaging in the conflict for no other reason than to free slaves.  As I said, the book is biased to the point of absurdity.Wortman can scarcely hide his glee in describing just a few of the abuses and atrocities committed by Sherman's marauders upon Georgia's civilians, at that point consisting mostly of "old men, women, and children."  He glosses over the fact that Sherman, along with most of those fighting under his command, was unabashedly racist, and wanted nothing to do with the blacks his soldiers had set free.  The author shrugs off the countless crimes and abuses against civilians committed by the invaders under Sherman's command, and even defends Sherman, alleging that the good general couldn't really have done anything to stop the abuses, and that those quarrelsome Southerners had brought it all upon themselves, anyway.  Sherman never made any genuine attempt to curtail his marauding armies (hey, you men stop that! wink, wink), but, that's not important to Wortman.Wortman even goes out of his way to slander Confederates who were unrelated to the subject of the book - men who played no part in the Atlanta campaign.  For some reason, Wortman felt it necessary to digress for an entire page to ridicule and belittle the celebrated Confederate cavalry officer John Hunt Morgan, even though Morgan had no role in the Atlanta campaign.  He also can't resist throwing a jab at another celebrated Confederate who had no role in the Atlanta campaign: cavalry commander Nathan Bedford Forrest, a man described by preeminent civil war scholar Ed Bearss as "one of the great combat leaders of American history," but who is dismissed as "murderous" by Wortman's pen.  (Bearss has far more impressive credentials than does Wortman, so I'll go with Bearss on this one).Wortman quotes many Confederates out of context, frequently twisting their words to try to buttress his own prejudices.  He uses so many ellipses (...) in piecing together his quotes, that the (by now) skeptical reader has to spend additional time looking up what the subjects actually said, before Wortman hacked their statements to pieces to fit his own agenda.  Even more annoying, Wortman unnecessarily and derisively fills his hacked-up Confederate quotes with "[sic]" in order to emphasize (and ridicule) their quaint misspellings and grammatical errors, obviously wanting the reader to infer that the Confederates were a bunch of dumb hicks and simpletons.  But ironically, the author makes some embarrassing errors of his own, such as referring to the "Western & Atlanta" railroad on page 282.  (An author writing about the Atlanta campaign should be able to correctly identify the famous Western & ATLANTIC RR).  Wortman also, on p. 220, refers to Stonewall Jackson as "the Confederacy's greatest cavalry hero."  How could anyone but a hack make such a glaring error as to refer to Stonewall Jackson as a cavalry officer?  The author, on page 342, incorrectly substitutes "immigrate" for "emigrate," and, on page 247, he describes the scene as mourners "filed passed" the body of General Leonidas Polk (as opposed to filing PAST the body of the fallen general).  Mr. Wortman, my Civil War ancestor may have been a poor Confederate private from Kentucky, but at least I know the difference between a verb and a preposition!  Did no one edit this work before throwing it into publication?  An author so quick to ridicule the quaint misspellings and grammatical errors of Confederate soldiers, many having little if any formal education, should edit his own work more carefully before it goes to print.The author ends his endeavor with a quote from his admired General Sherman, who, explaining why the war had been "inevitable," stated, "Here we were claiming to be the freest people in all the world, and offering liberty to all mankind, and yet there...were 4,000,000 slaves in the United States, and we had in the heart of the country an institution antagonistic to the very principles of our government.  So it had to be abolished."  Neither Sherman nor Wortman offers any explanation as to why, if their motive had indeed been the abolition of slavery, Lincoln and the Yankees had chosen to wage a brutal civil war to accomplish what every other civilized nation had been able to accomplish peacefully.Telling the story of the Atlanta campaign through the eyes of those who experienced the events would have made an interesting work.  Unfortunately, the writer's inability to resist cluttering the narrative with his own biases and prejudices turned it into a major disappointment.  Those interested in an objective account of the Atlanta campaign will not find it here.
$SUMMARY.: Glaringly biased and one-sided.

Amy Richie does a wonderful job of weaving a tale of high school werewolves, survival, and love.

I can't wait to read the next novel in the series to see what happens from here!  Well written, great plot, suspense and romance.  I couldn't put it down until it was done!

$REVIEW.: I loved the beginning and then the end.  What on this earth was that in the middle?  It turned into a COMPLETELY different novel in the middle and then back to being what it started out as in the beginning.  Seriously.  I was so confused.  I honestly felt like the author stuck a different book in the middle and I just really hated the direction it started going and how the characters were not at all true to the way they really were.  If I had just read the beginning and the end, I would have given this book 5 stars, but that middle part was just awkward!  If you read this and you feel love the beginning and then you feel like you have fallen down a rabbit hole somewhere along the way, just push on through because the ending IS worth it.

$review_text.: I laughed out loud so many times as the Octogenarian Sleuth and his young partner in crime solving stay one step ahead of the cops and the robbers and in this delightful &#8220;cozy&#8221; mystery set in a retirement home.  The pair must lay low because the retirement home director, ever worried about the public image of the Palisades, threatens banishment of Pete from the home and terminating his partner&#8217;s job.  The police don&#8217;t want Pete on their &#8220;turf.&#8221;Main character Pete Petersen, eighty something, lives in the Palisades retirement home.  Seeing a commotion across the street one day, he swings the Palisades' telescope around and sees bank robbers running from the bank.Only Pete spots the clue that cracks the case, but the police ignore &#34;the old geezer.&#34;  So Pete and his new sidekick Samantha, a twenty-something Palisades food server with a community college degree in criminal justice and crime scene investigation, take charge.  And they do it fast, because one of the crooks is hiding somewhere inside Palisades.The Case of the Magic Telescope is a charming, witty and funny &#34;cozy&#34; mystery loaded with mystery, puns and funny wordplay.  Incisive though funny dialogue shows how younger people--anyone under 70--ignore their wiser elders at their own peril.Readers of all ages will love this book.  Senior citizens will love The Case of the Magic Telescope for its engaging mystery, its interesting and amusing characters, and the brilliant wordplay by author Bill Petersen that will have them laughing.  Cozy mystery fans will love the story for its charm, wit and entertaining twists and turns.  A brilliant debut, with more in the series promised for our enjoyment.

$review_text.: "Reunited at Christmas" by Debra Ullrick is a sweet contemporary romance set in Colorado.  Shelby is a best-selling author who lives in a log cabin, in a small town in the mountains.  In addition, she trains search and rescue dogs, and participates in rescue missions.  She gets an emergency call and sets out with her rescue dog, Max, to find a missing snowmobiler.  The man she is searching for is her ex-fianc&eacute;e, Ryker Anderson.Ryker left her eighteen months ago without an explanation.  Now, he's back to beg for forgiveness, hoping she'll take him back.  He explains why he left, but doesn't explain completely until several chapters later. While waiting to admit the truth could be a technique to create a touch of suspense to the story, my reaction was to almost put the book down for good.  This is a question of where to place information in the book.  It's a judgment call.  There's no one answer on how to construct a story.  But in my opinion, the information should have been given the first time, because I reacted with feeling that this story was going to be lame.The book is well written for the most part.  The author has published thirteen romance books.  The story is well paced, has elements of excitement, and leads to a happy ending.  But, it seems that this author is getting story advice from a different agent than I am.I subscribe to several newsletters put out by literary agents.  In one post, an agent recommended avoiding the use of clich&eacute;s; not just phrases like "light as a feather", which this author uses, but other clich&eacute;s.  She said that cancer is a clich&eacute; because so many manuscripts use that for a dreaded disease.  She also said that a heroine who is an author is also a clich&eacute;.  Yes, we authors think we have the best job in the world, but too many authors are using that as a dream job in their manuscripts.Half way through the book the author introduces a new character and changes the plot from romance to suspense.  I felt this part of the story was bait and switch in genre, because if it was going to be a suspense story, then it should have started in chapter one.  The character wasn't well-developed or believable, and was just an easy way out.The author also switches the heroine's motivation halfway through the book.  At first, she is a strong and capable woman.  Then she becomes a person with low self-esteem.  Then she becomes afraid of being abandoned.  Her motivation and the cause of her motivation don't match up.  The last four books I've reviewed used low self-esteem as a motivation, so that is becoming a clich&eacute; as well.But I did like the way the author used faith without resorting to a church scene and the clich&eacute; sermon.The story is enjoyable, but not great.  If you buy your wine at Wal-Mart, you might like it, but if you're looking for a bottle that has a date on it, you're in the wrong cellar.

$review_text.: I was so happy this book was an eBook, because buying the eBook was the quickest way to get the words under my eyeballs. :)  And am I ever glad I did!  Not only is the plot itself amazing, but Jane Lark does an amazing job of helping the reader to understand her characters, either through offering background information, intimating their inner thoughts, or showing us how they react to things outside their control.  The two main characters become emotionally bare with one another, vulnerable to the core.  And, just when you think the story must be coming to its conclusion...BAM!  There is WAY more story to be told.Sounds amazing, right?!  Well, IT IS!  But there is another reason this book is oh so special to me.  If you've read some of my other reviews, or my first blog post ever, you might know that I hold a special place in my heart for books about characters who are able to overcoming abuse...who are survivors.  Well, I felt an extreme kinship with Ellen Harding.  I realize her 'keeper' was not someone she was married to, and the abuse I personally have gone through was not so much physical as it was mental and emotional, but I thoroughly and completely understand her.  Ellen feels that somehow she got herself into the situation she is in, and that no one and nothing can get her out of it.  She must deserve what she's gotten out of life.  But when she meets Edward, she starts to wonder  if not only there is a possibility of someone saving her, but if maybe she deserves better, despite everything she's done...if only she didn't have such a sordid past.  When Edward helps Ellen to flee her captor, they both discover they have a lot to learn about each other...Alright, I would LOVE to tell you oh so much more about this fabulous novel, but I don't want to give the story away before you read it!

I am not sure if there are books ahead of this one. But as a little novella it is a great glimpse into a PNR/erotica/romance series.Not going to over do it on details as it is only thirty pages.

It describes events that take place after an EMP attack and the effect it has on those who are prepared and those who are not.This was one of the first books I've read related to a potential apocalypse and it definitely made me think. The likelihood of something like this happening is all too real and I would venture to say that few of us are truly prepared.There is considerable emphasis on the political ramifications towards the end of the book that, for me, became rather boring. Also the ending was somewhat unsatisfying, but apparently there will be a sequel in 2015 (a long time to wait).P.S. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the editing is atrocious!

I usually like different takes on werewolves but this one just did not do it for me. I had high hopes for this book. Will I continue with this series? Yes, b/c hopefully it will get better and like I said I like werewolf books. This is probably not the best or longest review I will do, so don't judge me by this review :D.

$review_text.: Spolier alert! I loved book 1! The chemistry between the members of B team, the automatic chemistry they had with Baka, and the developing love between Eloea and Ram was what pulled me into the book. Book 2, however, introduces the characters Litha, Aelsong, Heaven, and Katrina into the mix.Storm was so solidly in love and then in book 2, it just vanishes?!  That's not how love works; that's how teenage infatuation works. There's nothing going on in this match but lust. Every time interactions between Storm and new girl  worm their way back into the dialogue, I find myself skipping pages to get back to the plot.I'm still reading this novel and hope (regardless of the ominous feeling in the back of my head) that Storm ends up with somebody other than who the book is implying he'll end up with. I hope the girl who the book implies he'll end up with dies falling off a cliff and never returns. She's arrogant, annoying, and doesn't provide the romance I got from Elora and Ram. She's more like, "hey, you should like me & be impressed by me. I want us to get married. I think we should live together and so should you." Day one. Back up and back off! Storm deserves true love, not just sex.

The preparation prior to cooking puts it well over 30-minutes.  Don't be fooled.The lack of organization to the book is another drawback.  It would be helpful to have an index to direct you to what you're looking for.  Basically it's a book with a bunch of recipes thrown inside.  With all these complaints from me, I still bought the book and actually my family has enjoyed several of the meals I've made.

$review_text.: I was glad that I read this book.  The Jackson, the H, was a great .  He was very much in love with Keylie, the h.  I loved that he was faithful to her.  Once he met her, no other woman would do.  I was concerned because Jackson thought that he was in love with Alexa, the h in Push the Envelope, the 1st book in the series.  However, the author did a good job of showing the readers that was not the case, that Jackson felt just an attraction and protectiveness towards Alexa, hi sister's best friend.  I liked how Jackson was willing to do anything to be with Keylie, even changing his long term plans.  (I would go into more detail but do not want to provide spoilers.)  The pace was good and the story kept my interest.  While I enjoyed the first book in the series, the books are independent of each other and therefore book 1 does not need to be read to appreciate and understand this book.

$review_text.: This is the story of Holton and Elena.  They grew up together as they lived at neighboring ranches.  There was an 8 year difference in ages.  He chose to stay a rancher and she went to college 10 hours away.  She knew she loved him since she was a child but he always said he was too old for her.  She waited years for him to be her first lover.  Very sweet read with some spicy passages. I would recommend this to anyone who believes in true, everlasting love.

$REVIEW.: I have read another Van Holt book in the past (The Gundowners), and really enjoyed it.  So now I'm back, trying another book by Holt.  And I have to say, I think I liked it as much as the first!Six-Gun Showdown is the story of Sandie Turner, and her quest for revenge for the death of her mother.  She is convinced by the unbelievably sleazeball-rific Claude Brown that the murder was Jim Dexter.  Upon hearing this accusation, HE sets out to kill Claude.  But then SANDIE doesn&#8217;t want JIM to kill CLAUDE, because she wants ANSWERS.  Benny Hill music plays, hilarity ensues.Like the previous book that I read, this is a Old West story, through and through.  The characters are so well realized, that I really felt a connection with them by the end of this book, and was bummed to see their story end.  The world, and story in general, is gritty and stylish, and I think it stays very true to what it is, and doesn&#8217;t try to be anything else.That sort of sounds like a bad thing, like it&#8217;s not trying to be different, but I don&#8217;t mean it that way.  Not everything has to be &#8220;Taking X genre and turning it on it&#8217;s head!&#8221;  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with a straight up western story, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for, and if that IS what you&#8217;re looking for, I highly recommend Six-Gun Showdown, and Van Holt&#8217;s catalog of work.

$REVIEW.: Dr. John Piper is a gifted pastor, author and communicator of the Word of God who is well worth your time and energy.  This is at least the third book that I have read by Piper.  In each of them, I am quite pleased with the exhaustive use of Scripture to guide the reader to truth and its application.  Though I don't agree on every point of doctrine, I have study Bibles with pages marked, "See Piper, The Pleasures of God, p. 34" or the like.  I am certain that after reviewing my hundreds of underlines and notes throughout, that this book will provide more of those.  You may not wish to borrow any of my books from John Piper since you will have to read between the lines, quite literally.I have a couple negative comments.  At 400 pages, this book, like two others that I have read of his is long.  In addition, unlike The Pleasures of God and Desiring God, I found myself laboring through some of the chapters.If you are an average reader don't avoid this book.  No one should avoid it. I think it has a valuable message, dare I say, untouched by others.  If you get bogged down and tempted to quit, check out the next chapter and then the next.  In the worst case scenario, look at the index and read the best material Piper offers in the following:Faith in Future Grace vs. AnxietyFaith in Future Grace vs. PrideThe Solid Logic of HeavenFaith in Future Grace vs. ImpatienceFaith in Future Grace vs. CovetousnessLoving Ministry More Than LifeFaith in Future Grace vs. DespondencyFaith in Future Grace vs. LustThe Future Grace of SufferingThe Future Grace of DyingI received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this reviewFor supplemental material about this book, see my review at:  [...]

$REVIEW.: My Dear Charlotte is a novel written in letters from one sister to another

It is a British regency mystery that contains actual language of Jane Austen and gives a wonderful account of life in England in the early 1800s

The main character and writer of the letters, Elinor, lives in Lyme with her parents and writes faithfully to her sister Charlotte who is visisting relatives in Bath


Elinor gives Charlotte all of the details of the recent death in their small community and the mystery of who might have killed the woman

She also goes into great detail about all of the dinners and dances she attends while Charlotte is away

It is a charming look at everyday life for a young woman living at this time.I really enjoyed this book a lot
It is different from other books that I have read in that the entire book is letters sent from Elinor to Charlotte so we only ever get Elinor's point of view

It also does not really give a lot of insight into Elinor's feelings since it is more of just an account of events happening, Elinor does not go into detail on her own feelings very often
It is a very straight forward look at the mystery of who might have killed Mrs Woodstock and accounts of the behaviors of all those who might be involved in the murder

Elinor works with the magistrate on the case, a widowed man with two boys, and as the mystery comes closer to being solved we see Elinor become more attached to the boys and the father

It is a sweet romance that begins with friendship and mutual respect.I do not think everyone would enjoy this book as much as I did


I think that only people who really enjoy reading about this time will like it


There are so many little details about shopping, clothes, bonnets, food, books, etc


that I could see how others could get bogged down in all of the detail

I found it all fascinating and I think that someone who really loves Jane Austen books will find this a worthwhile read.

$REVIEW.: I always enjoy Donna's books. I had read some of the other Baron books so wanted to continue with Lizzie's story. It was hard to see the struggle between Lizzie and her father, especially because Brock Baron was making everything harder for Lizzie than it needed to be. It added to the struggle between Lizzie and Chris the father of her baby. But then that's what makes a romance book, but that's also why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 rating.

$REVIEW.: Devlin Vaughan is enraged to the point of obsession when he sees his former lover, Julia Beaumont, following a year's absence when she abandoned him to go with another to France. She broke his heart and humiliated him and now he wants her back on his terms. She's trying to shield her heart from being broken by a man who only wants a mistress.This is a story of miscommunications where two people fail to express to one another their true feelings. Each is left to speculate from the behaviors of the other with disastrous results. Normally, that's a story that would drive me batty but not a lot of time was wasted here and it wasn't protracted. More emphasis was put on learning from both Julia and Devlin's perspectives just how deeply their passions ran and what they really wanted.I enjoyed this opening novella with its steaminess and honesty. It's my first introduction to Jennifer Haymore and I like her writing style. I'm looking forward to reading all the books planned for this series.

$review_text.: It felt like I waited for ever for this book, I mean crap I was left on a plane with Finn and Raven


 What about Declan?? Well the wait was SOOOOOOOOOOO worth it

 This book was amazing


 Ahren has an ability to write amazing love scenes and to be honest I was floored by the way she captured them from Declans point of view


 I also loved the fact that she bounced between POV&#8217;s so that you got a glimpse into how everyone actually felt
 Ahren was successfully able to maintain the connection that you made in Surrendering and build upon it strengthening it throughout surviving.Beyond the love story this book shows us how our amazing group of friends grows and overcomes some huge hurdles


 While Ahren has added plot twists and turns to the story to add a hint of intrigue I was most captured by her ability to capture the emotions through the entire novel


 I can not tell you the last time I read a novel that had me pulling for the love, and crying because I was so happy, mad, sad &#8211; emotional rainbow!I loved the direction that Ahren took with this novel from start to finish


 It was a page turner for me that I could not put down !!!!!While the ending of this story was enough to close the books and tie all loose ends I am really pulling for additional &#8220;spin off&#8221; novels cause to be honest I can not get enough of the men in these novels.Fantastic all around !!

$review_text.: Downloaded this for free from Amazon. I really enjoyed Gina L. Maxwell's MMA hero series, so I thought I'd give this one a go.Boy am I glad I did!This book:1. is well written, edited and proofread2. Stars a sexy alpha hero who makes your toes curl3. Describes a(mostly) believable storyline4. Has sizzling sex scenes, and plenty of 'em!There are two things the book could have done better. The first is have a major conflict between the heroes. They don't fight their attraction, the heroine's secret comes out fairly easily, and even when they fight it doesn't seem permanent. I got about 3/4 of the way through and wasn't sure what was driving the story forward. I did finish it and enjoyed it; but the sex was way more riveting than the plot. The second is the heroine's backstory. While I believed Nico could have accidentally killed a man and be tormented about it, I didn't really believe that Elle had such a sordid past, especially considering what she had become as an adult. It didn't turn me off the book ... it just kind of fell flat in those parts.If you find yourself alone some afternoon and want a pick-me-up with plenty of steam, this book is worth the read!

$REVIEW.: Another great read by SK.  I literally couldn't put it down as another reviewer said, but I had to as I had to sleep, exercise and work.  You'll notice I didn't say eat as I would be reading when I am eating which isn't good but I just couldn't not have the kindle open reading this story.  Just about everyone has done things they've regreted and I loved Amir in this story.  Even though this is fiction there are every day occurences within it, some men feel it's okay to "tap" just about every woman they want to but no man must come near there sister or daughter or they'll want to do bodily harm.  My my my makes one wonder if they are really thinking when they do make such decisions.  Just saying I loved this book along with the rest in the SCH series.  I'm going to read Angel's Wrath now so I will be back in a few days with my review on that one.  HIGHLY REOMMENDED.

$REVIEW.: Molly Smith and her boyfriend Adam Tocek are both constables in the town of Trafalgar, British Columbia. Adam is also the handler of Norman, a highly trained police dog. Late one evening, Adam gets a call that there's a small boy missing from a camping area nearby, and all three of them respond. The boy is quickly found, unharmed, but Norman also finds some bones. Adult human bones.These bones are quickly determined to be the bones of Brian Nowak, a man who disappeared fifteen years ago. In an uncomfortable coincidence, Molly Smith, then known by the name her mother gave her, Moonlight, was a good friend of Brian's daughter Nicole. She had spent the previous night with her friend, and was the last person outside the family to see Brian before his disappearance while Nicole, her mother, and her brother Kyle were at church.The reopening of the investigation brings Nicole Nowak back from Vancouver, and forces Kyle, now an artist whose works become more disturbing the longer you look at them, to occasionally emerge from his basement apartment in his mother's house. The constable who investigated at the time of the disappearance, Paul Keller, is now the Chief Constable in Trafalgar, and can't resist getting involved in this reopened investigation. This brings him back into contact with Molly/Moonlight's recently widowed mother, Lucky Smith--whose hippie background and leftist politics aren't a comfortable match for becoming interested in a police officer. (Or for having a police officer as a daughter, but what's a mother to do?) Meanwhile, Molly is learning things about her old friend's life since she left town at sixteen, and her current career (not interior decorating, as she claims), and part of Nicole's new life follows her to Trafalgar, creating a danger for some of the young girls in town.As old questions get asked again, and previously overlooked stones are turned over, the entanglement of personal and professional, and past and present, creates tensions all over town, and leads to an unexpected answer to the mystery of why Brian Nowak disappeared, and how he wound up dead in the woods outside town.This is a neat, intricate mystery with wonderfully developed, complex characters. Highly recommended.I received a free electronic galley from the publisher via NetGalley.

$REVIEW.: When I first got the book, my assumption was that, it will be another of those 'Cinderella' like stories.  However, as I got into the book it got me engrossed at how different it was from the rest.Mia is already a self-made woman with career. Although not that wealthy, she has already established her possessions and she did it on her own.  She actually is so into her job and house that she forgot she needed a man in her life.  Almost.Max is an American working in Europe and badly needs a fast and easy way to renew his working visa.  This happened in the middle of financial crisis worldwide which made the scenario believable and forgiveable.  One could just shrug it off as part of the plot and accepts it.  Then came Mia to the rescue.Their marriage although arranged did not feel like it from the start.  The characters did not make it feel so fake and fell into their parts consistently.  As opposed to real marriage, Max and Mia have accomplished living together with less difficulties.  In fact they seemed to enjoy each other from the start.The author has successfully established everything within the story.  It's refreshing to not have too much drama on the relationship of the two characters.  It was even good of Mia to have her feelings on check all the time they were together.  Two points I wished the author has changed though was that, the story became too predictable towards the end when Mia got pregnant.  I could even guess that without the visit to the doctor.  But I must admit there probably is no other way to build that part.  Second, it seemed the author went in to rush to end the story.The best arranged marriage story I have read so far.  Highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: Having read, and enjoyed the series thus far, I am sad to say that this installment falls short. From the beginning the book has an air of being rushed. The author seems like he is struggling to align the direction the book needs to move to push the story, with the push of publishers to meet deadlines. Most of the action was two dimensional, the dialogue childish for the characters stated age, and overall a segment of the story I would have rather skipped. I can't help but wonder if a better sequel could repair the damage.

$review_text.: I first encountered Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan while watching wrestling on saturday mornings. I was a pretty young kid at the time, less than 10 years old. Heenan, nicknamed &quot;The Weasel&quot; by the fans, was the manager of most of the heel wrestlers. &quot;Heel&quot; is the wrestling term for a bad guy. I never liked the guy, but he was always entertaining. For a wrestler to align himself with Heenan it would instantly turn him into a heel as well. Heenan was that effective in his role as the Heel Manager.All wrestling biographies will inevitably be compared to that of Mick Foley's Have a Nice Day . The comparison will be in how truthful the biography is, how much detail it goes into, and how entertaining it is to read. Mick &quot;Mankind&quot; Foley set the bar high. Heenan's book is an entertaining and quick read. It appears to be truthful, breaking kayfabe (wrestling term for protecting the secrets of the business). While reviewers of Hulk Hogan's book take him to task for inaccurate detail, i have not seen any of the same problems with Heenan's book. However, Bobby Heenan does not go into much detail at all. For a biography of a wrestling legend (40 years in the business) to be less than 200 pages, so much seems to be left out.As a wrestling fan, it was nice to get a glimpse of a man i knew next to nothing about. That was all it was, though, a glimpse. It left me wanting to know more

Although I haven't used this for child birth, I've already been able to put these meditation exercises to use in my day to day life.I sometimes experience sleeplessness where I wake up, start thinking pointless thoughts, and can't get back to sleep. I've been able to use some of these practices to help me get back to sleep and it works every time, and very quickly. The exercise of not letting thoughts distract you and paying attention to your breath is an invaluable skill and can be used in many ways. I've also used this for mild headaches, and have found it works like a charm. I feel very encouraged to better learn these exercises for more major pains in my future.

I found myself conflicted with who is &#34;good&#34; and who is &#34;evil&#34; at different points of the story. From each character's point of view, what they are trying to accomplish may seem &#34;good&#34;. I like this struggle in a story and it keeps me guessing who is truly pure in heart.

The cover is very beautiful and sensual and did a good job of providing a visual image for the story.  The author displayed exceptional writing ability, too.

$review_text.: First, I want to say that I believe the author is clearly a compentent and highly educated banker. That does not make this book easy to follow at all. Second, I will not be finishing this book because it completely lacks a coherent story after me plodding through the first 68 pages. It is a waste of my time because I simply cannot follow what is going on. I did browse the rest of the book and it looks to be pretty much the same format. The author jumps from one time period to another time period sometimes several times on the same page. Third, it is a major distraction for me as he discusses so many different people, sometimes in the span of a single page, that it is just too much to comprehend. He tells you people's positions, full names, and ancillary background information in the middle of telling you why he was talking to the person in the first place! Finally, he seems to expect the reader to know about the past financial crises of Latin America without explaining them. For example, he has referred to the Tequilla Effect several times without saying what it was. Turns out it was just a name for a sudden devaluation of the Mexican peso that affected Mexico and Argentina. Yes, I had to look that up.I read technical documentation as part of my daily job, but I think for someone to enjoy this book they need the following:1. Patience for an author who digresses into sub-stories frequently2. Some historical knowledge of financial crises in Latin America or the willingness to look them up as they appear in the text.3. A background in banking and/or macroeconomicsI think if you had all three of those things, you would likely find this book interesting. The author clearly knows a lot of the worlds major players in banking and finance. For example, he has referred to speaking with Alan Greenspan on multiple occassions already. He also describes his first-hand contact with all the major players in Agentine politics, as well as discussions with central bankers all over the world.Ultimately, this book is just too difficult for me to read because I don't meet the pre-requisites that I listed above. Especially #1: I want a narrative that I can follow. I do not like one that jumps back-and-forth between various time periods, discussing different people, and many different background stories. I simply get lost in the minutiae.

$review_text.: Some critics didn't like the Twain/Nelson collaboration, saying Nelson failed to match Twain's high standards.  I think Nelson made Huck's travels more varied and interesting than Twain would've done.  The ending is especially fitting, as Huck--the boy without prejudice against blacks, Indians, or "defiled" women--gets a well-deserved reward.Huck and Tom is a cross between a rollicking boys' adventure and an Old West travelogue.  Sure, it has flaws, but it's worth reading.  Rob's rating:  8.0 of 10.For more on the subject, see:[...]

$REVIEW.: I did enjoy this book but must say I would have to read the next book to decide if the author follows through on his introduction characters. It is a very fast read so you might have to slow up a bit to catch all the characterizations and how they work, and it will leave you wishing you had part 2 on the shelf; so you might consider catching both before beginning. Ultimately, this will appeal mostly to Junior High/early High school age readers, but does not alienate adults of any age. Give it a shot - as the one thing it doesn not do is get boring...

$review_text.: This grabbed me from reading the sample and I'm glad it was all uphill from there. These were some crazy folks. Even Anthony, who was the least crazy out of the bunch was a little off at times. He was so loving and patient with Eartha knowing she was fragile and confused when they first met. She and Anthony had a rough start but she put herself out there again, even after the continued hurt and abuse her ex and family put her through. Some of the crazy that was going on in this book was off the hook but so was the love that grew between Anthony and Eartha. Even being in the eye of the tornado they called their life, they were able to pull off a HEA. This was fun, sweet, semi hot and chock full of crazy, and I enjoyed every page.

$REVIEW.: This is probably the most up to date and best book to come out on African history in years.  It covers every African nation in depth and focuses on all the important themes.  Beginning with independence it covers the struggle in Algeria, Ghana, and of course the famous 1960 year of independence.  it covers De Gaulle and the Suez Crises, moving south to survey the Belgian Congo and the Portuguese colonies.  Moving on it looks at the cold war struggle and the white minority regimes.  The book reminds us of the two million Europeans who once inhabited north Africa.Many forgotten episodes will be new to people.  This is simply a tour de force.  No stone is left unturned.  From the AIDS epidemic to the African dictatorships that looted their nations to the idealism or Senegal and Tanzania to the horrors of Idi Amin and Mugabe and 'elder' statement like Hastings Banda as well as crooks like Liberia's Taylor.  The civil conflicts in Katanga and Biafra are covered, as is the struggle against Apartheid.  No one will be left unhappy.  One does not need to be an African enthusiast to find interest here, a general interest in history and our modern world will suffice.  This book will help explain why year after year Africa gets poorer and deeper in debt and no matter the UN and the NGOs and the Aid organizations nothing is helping.  Although pessimistic, this is a fair, balanced and refreshingly honest account, both good history, reporting and writing in one volume.  There is surprisingly little judgment and politics here, simply an amazing familiarity with all the triumphs and tragedy of the last fifty years, from French human rights violations in Algeria to the theft of farms by Mugabe.Seth J.

$REVIEW.: I have to admit, I like that it wasn't typical of chick lit.  The main character, Elizabeth, definitely has a brain in her head and knows how to use it.  I like the premise of a non-bimbo existing and surviving in a bimbo's world, and I also like the way she captures the general shallowness of Hollywood types.  Sure, her characters may be a little stereotypical, but it's all in good fun.  Her jaded wit and her observations about models and bimbos is classic (especially when talking about bimbo Blaze putting on her &quot;intellectual&quot; glasses).  Now for what didn't work: Being that the author was a screenwriter, the only details she really gives the reader are purely visual; she fails to evoke the other senses.  That didn't bother me too much, though because L.A. is preoccupied with the visual anyway.  With her platonic male friend (I forget his name), his past seems tacked on to me, and I really didn't get a chance to care about him enough for it to really ring true.  I like how she can work a plot, and work dialog, and that's where her skills as a screen writer really shine through.  My biggest gripe though was the cop-out ending.  I won't spoil it for anyone, but that was enough to make me take two stars off it.  A bad ending is hard for me to shake, but I give her three stars for making this a little grittier than your usual chick fare.

$REVIEW.: First of all I am an occasional reader. I have two young kids and this to me, was a difficult read. There were a lot of different languages (German, Ukraine, ect) that were hard for me to follow. Also it kept going back and forth from the 1930's to the early 2000's and I felt like I had to really concentrate to know who was who rather than it being a simple read. I was finally able to grasp the story as a whole after two-thirds of the way in, and was able to enjoy the remaining story line with ease.

$REVIEW.: I mixed feelings when I started to read  &#34; Addicted in Cold Blood&#34;. I am usually not a great fan of science fiction;however, as I read I became fascinated with the basic premise of the plot. I found myself &#34;addicted&#34;. I had to find out how it would end. It was worth persevering to the end. Xzion, an alien from the planet Zarkstrom, has committed a number of gruesome murders in the Baltimore/DC area. The victims all drug traffickers or street dealers. Jayme Knight is Baltimore policewoman tasked with finding the murderer. She finds him but he takes her captive. These two end up in a very erotic relationship and Xzion discovers he has emotions. The story is really complicated but as it progresses you see how complex Xzion is and he is not just a maniacal killer. You keep wondering how this alien and his human lover can have HEA but they do. This book will have you sitting and thinking about long after you're done.

$REVIEW.: This was a good story, written well. It has all the elements required to draw the reader into its universe. That background universe is also very well thought out, with enough depth and breadth to support innumerable follow on stories. But this story holds up on its own. It is complete, you don't have to go on to read the next book to enjoy it (although you'll probably want to). What I really liked in this story was its mix of &#34;foreign&#34; military protocols, political/diplomatic ineptitude and intelligent heroics. There's something particularly gripping about the crew's own sense of the overwhelming odds against which they contend in each battle, and uplifting about their responses. There's also a significant expenditure of future tech military ordinance and lots of fun 3 dimensional chess in the solar system wide movements of the combatants as they slug it out.

$review_text.: This is one of the few books I'd be willing to purchase the "dead tree" format and pass along to colleagues, family, strangers (the major - shortsighted - downfall of Audible.com - can't pass along books).Godin even ends his terrific little manifesto with a plea to "pass along this book" - oh if only it was so easy.Why do I consider this little book a must read for folks who work in industries where change is essential for survival (and what industry is not one of these industries?)Tribes is inspiring in its message that we all need to be leaders in our organization.  That leadership is not management, rather leadership is both more important and more fun.  Leadership exists at every level of the organization, and in fact those in the middle have the power to spread their ideas as the channels of communication and collaboration get wider and deeper.This book particularly resonated with me in my role in higher education, as I am lucky enough to work in a unit and with colleagues who are all dedicated to creating learning (rather then teaching) institutions.  This work is always exhilarating, but often exhausting, as we try to work within the historical, organizational and economic structure of a very old industry.  Frankly, I appreciated being bucked up by Godin's message, and I came away from the book with a renewed commitment to lead this Tribe.

$review_text.: (I was given a copy for review.)I wanted to hate this book
 I was halfway through and was convinced that nothing good would happen to the protagonist, 14 year old Ja'Nil of the Fisherfolk.Here's this young girl, ostracized by her people and living with horrible memories of a tragic past, who's thrust into this unwanted journey in search of a healer
 And pretty much every character she meets on her way to Cordia has ulterior motives when it comes to poor Ja'Nil

 Except for the potential love interest


 He's not evil...yet.On the other hand, the majority of the female characters are strong and smart and likeable


 I wonder if the author was trying to make a point.And yet, I liked what I read
 The second half of the book focused more on the overarching storyline versus Ja'Nil's misfortunes, and this is where the writing is at its strongest.I just don't think it's enough for me to want to read part 2.

The couple having to deal with the little issues that come up with blending families made this story very relatable.  The manner in which the author dealt with the lines that people have to draw was great.  I especially liked that the h did not back down from any fight in the story.

$REVIEW.: `Manliness' has been declining in popularity as an ideal during the last few decades; not just to the detriment of boys and men but also to women, families and communities. In response William Bennett has resuscitated an old question, `what does it mean to be a man?` and provided a very satisfying answer.  He assembled an excellent compendium of stories, poems, and profiles that provide models, virtues and reflections that capture the essence of manhood. The writings are a remarkable survey of thinkers and writers across the landscape of Western Civilization.  For children these writings are highly educational, will ignite the imagination and stimulate thoughtful conversations.My only critique with this work is the order of the topics. Rather than war, I would have put family and/or prayer first. After all deference ought to be given to the One who created males and females to create families. This work is highly recommended for mothers and fathers to share with their sons to help with their growth into mature men.

It's not unlike others he's liked: minutely observed, finely articulated novels featuring troubled men, alone, wandering about in major cities: O'Neill's Netherland, Cole's Open City, Dyer's Jeff in Venice, etc. I like them all too -- they are very intelligent, shrewd books -- but there is something tremendously sad about all of them, too. They share the theme of what I'll call the Unrealized, and it is utterly relentless. A sort of impotence of the soul that itself is an aesthetic, a philosophy, a zeitgeist. One can appreciate these novels for their accomplishment and their intelligence, but it's really very hard to care about them, their characters, and certainly one can't imagine re-reading them.

$review_text.: First of all if you have not read The Intern Volume One run don't walk to your nearest e-retailer and 1-click that bad boy NOW!! You don't want to read volume two without reading the first volume first or else you will be completely lost


Not to mention you are missing plenty of Bentley hotness.Okay moving on! The Intern Volume Two picks up right where Volume One left off

If you thought Bentley couldn't get any hotter you are wrong! We get to see Bentley in alpha mode...***Changes panties***Yeah it was hot to say the least.Cici and Bentley are trying to learn to walk the fine line of their relationship

Bentley torn between his growing feelings and sense of mistrust and Cici struggling to juggle her feelings and trying to stick to her goal of unraveling what happened to her dad


Then in typical Brooke fashion she drops a bomb on us leaving us speechless, shocked and begging for more.I give The Intern Volume Two 5++++ Kisses
I absolutely loved this book and cannot wait to see what Brooke has for us in The Intern Volume Three.In the end this book was more than I expected and so much more

If you want hot a hot, melt your panties read then read this series!!!

$review_text.: I have not read the first two books in this series and this is the 3rd in the series, so I strongly recommend starting with book #1 The Skin Map Bright Empires followed by book #2 The Bone House Bright Empires


The series delves into the notion of space and time travel along what the author calls "ley lines", or lines of extraordinary metaphysical power that enable the "travelers" to jump between one time and place to another


It's a very intriguing concept; whether you believe in the spiritual realm or not, there's always something fascinating about the unknown, the magical, the extraordinary, and Lawhead capitalizes on that core human desire of finding meaning to our existence
There are many examples of civilizations exploring the spiritual realm, from Stonehenge to the Mayans to Einstein's Theory of Relativity
Throughout history mankind has flirted along the edge of reality.Book #3 The Spirit Well continues developing the story of several characters introduced in the first two books who via "ley travel" are searching across time and space for the "Skin Map." The Skin Map is the actual skin of Arthur Flinders-Petrie who devoted his life to find the "Spirit Well" and had his skin tattooed with cryptic symbols creating a map of the many ley lines and portals
The map, when complete, shows the way to the well


This well is described as the Fountain of Youth and even brought Arthur's wife back to life
This book surrounds a secret Zetetic Society which is tasked with assisting travelers who possess the special ability of ley travel

As with any good story, there are competing forces of good and evil

The travelers have to be constantly wary of Lord Burleigh and his minions who want the Skin Map for their own nefarious devices

Would have personally liked to have read the series in order beginning with book #1 leading through to this the 3rd book in the series.

Christmas is a special time, and this story, just like Dickens', should be a classic
A Vampire's Christmas Carol is a unique paranormal twist that left me crying happy tears
I've read over 900 books in the last four years and not many are worth the time to write a review

This book, though short, is defiantly worth the time! Thank you Cynthia for writing this book

$review_text.: After a dry spell of nearly a decade, I began reading books as fast as I could find them a few years ago. I had amassed dozens of books during the time I wasn't reading. Some of the books I read had great reviews and some did not, nonetheless I enjoyed them all--until this one. When I was younger I found history to be the most uninteresting subject imaginable.  Then came the history channel, the military channel and I discovered brilliant historical fiction novels by  Ken Fillet and Christian Jacq and have become obsessed with these books. By now it's well known that Hitler and his men were into the occult. This author takes on too much to fit into this number of pages. She is a very good writer, but I felt that the plot was lost at times and there were times I didn't want to pick the book back up. I might read another one of her books in the future, but for now I'm glad to be done. Otto, the main character in this book is believed to be the inspiration for the Indiana Jones movies.

$review_text.: `The Complete Idiot's Guide to Vegan Living' by Beverly Lynn Bennett and Ray Sammartano, `Vegan Freak' by Bob Torres and Jenna Torres, and `Vegan Planet' by Robin Robertson are three books my godson purchases, believing they were oriented primarily toward what most of us would consider a vegetarian diet adopted for simple health reasons. The primary objective of this review is to warn those who may be interested in these books for the same purpose. And, to make a strong distinction between the first two and the third.The vegan lifestyle, at its heart, is far more than a dietary regimen. It is a combination of a system of spiritual values, culinary choices for health, and economic values allied with `green' doctrines of helping to preserve resources. Surprisingly, the first is by far the most important of these three, especially to those like the authors of the `Vegan Freak' book. One need read only a few pages of this book to realize veganism may in some senses be considered a Hindu sect, as it shares many of the same values of this religion, including many approaches to animal products which are as extremely anti-scientific as the rejection of some scientific theories by those who espouse creationism. As someone who has some reasonably sound background in Christian and Jewish doctrines, I can say with some certainty that vegan values are NOT shared by either Christian, Jewish, or Muslim value systems. In fact, the Judeo-Christian scriptures are often cited as justifications for using animal products. I will also venture the thought that the vegan doctrines are not consistent with secular ethical theory. By the definition assumed by every ethical value system, including those based on Judaism and Christianity, moral principles are those principals related specifically to behavior toward other humans. Thus, the vegan apologists are truly stretching the meaning of `ethical' or `moral' in order to add cachet to their preaching, which it does not deserve. That doesn't mean these values are baseless. It just means they need some justification which is independent of moral theories.Now that is not to say many vegan values are not shared by the non-vegan population at large. Most civilized people, and even cultures which may be considered pre-civilized savages, place a value on `humane' treatment of animals. Thus, we have dedicated a fair amount of resources to SPCA organizations and other animal rescue organizations. It is also due more to ignorance than to inhumanity that we indulge in animal products which are raised in an inhumane manner. And, the rationale that these animals would never have lived if it were not for our raising them specifically for food is scant excuse.As sound as the basic vegan value system is, to some peoples' minds, it seems to cross some line from humane principles to surprising extremes when it raises its ban against literally every animal product, no matter how remotely removed from cruel commercial animal husbandry. Two of the most extreme examples are bans against vaccines because they are incubated in eggs and many beers and wines, because they are clarified using animal products. Less extreme, but similarly questionable are the prohibitions against milk and eggs, especially if one makes the effort to purchase products raised according to humane husbandry techniques. Here, one encounters many of the health concerns of vegans, and for many people, milk and eggs have health problems. But not for everyone. And, eggs and milk products are the basis of some of the most nutritious and delicious food products.`Vegan Freaks', as one may assume from the title, is the most extremely doctrinaire of the three books. As with the `freaks' of the 60's and later, they revel in their differentness, making that a fourth leg of their vegan lifestyle. `...Vegan Living' is less strident, but, it is no less doctrinally `pure'. It is somewhat easier to read, as it does not have the attitude of poking a stick in the eyes of non-vegans. Both are excellent starting points and both have very good bibliographies for obtaining additional information. But, neither contains any major sections on recipes! And this is where a purchaser may be most surprised, believing that these are `cookbooks'.`Vegan Planet' is substantially different, as it is a cookbook from start to finish. In fact, it is not even doctrinally pure vegan, as it joyfully includes bread recipes which use yeast! As I write this, I realize that it has been a very long time since I took high school biology, and I'm no longer sure whether yeasts are related to the animal protozoans or the `vegetable' fungi. Except for this somewhat gray area, the book is otherwise true vegan, except that it never leaves the kitchen in order to climb on its soapbox and preach its gospel of avoiding animal products in every form.In the end, if you have health concerns which bring you to the vegan diet, `Vegan Planet' is certainly the book you want. It will give you hundreds of recipes which simulate dishes traditionally cooked with milk, plus lots of great recipes for the staple vegan protein replacements such as beans, pulses, and grains. The other two books may only be of value if you are interested in the vegan value system. And, although these books mention the raw `cooking' style, neither deals with it in any depth. For that, I suggest `RAW, The UnCook Book' by Juliano.

$review_text.: The Art of War by Glenn Langohr is his most revealing prison book yet. At Centinella's prison on the California border of Mexico a prison guard exposed an inmate who was a notorious Child Molester, knowing that meant he would get stabbed. Having lived through so much that is wrong with the prison system, and now becoming a great writer, Glenn Langohr is the one to tell the story of our broken Justice System in the United States. I have read and have been a huge fan of this author because of the honesty, heart and troubles has had through his life. To do a complete turn-around from that 'who he was' to this 'who is has become' has been an inspiration to me through his books! Thank you!

$review_text.: Nick Bruel discovered this story after his father, Robert O. Bruel, passed away. Originally titled, "Two Worms," the younger Bruel made slight changes to make it fit as a picture book and added colorful and charming illustrations. He changed the title to "Bob and Otto" because it's not truly about two worms... can't spoil it.This story could easily turn into a cheesy one by any other author. But the Bruels together have created a sweet story about friendship, being apart, and showing how they help each other out. You can draw many lessons from this including science.My five-year-old loved saying the repetitive phrases and chided us parents whenever we dared read them. The story uses many site words that will help the pre-K and kindergartener with word recognition (without them knowing it).And of course, being the content maven I am, I like that both names are palindromes. :) This is the first Bruel book I've read and already, I've put in a request at my local library for the others.

$review_text.: This is an excellent volume full of real experience from the authors who truly have been there before.  They pass on what they have learned in a friendly, easy to read book that pinpoints exactly what you can do to get your baby onto a sleep schedule.The most eye opening idea from the book was to keep a sleep journal.  I never, ever thought of that before and it's such a wonderful idea.  After all, we keep food journals so we can spot trends in our diets so why not keep a sleep journal for our baby?  This idea alone was worth the price of the book!I also liked that the authors provided a table of just how much sleep is necessary and normal at various ages.  This is enormously helpful and provides a fast reference point.The book contains a number of tips and techniques that you can use separately or together to make sleep time the best possible for both you and your baby.  They are presented in such a way that they explain just what each technique is, how to apply it, and why it works.I also found the Healthy Sleep Habits FAQ at the end of the book to be quite informative and covers many of the common questions you may think of while using the methods presented.Overall I found this incredibly informative.  It provides all the information you need in a small package so you can read it and start applying the contents immediately.  I definitely highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: What an adorable and heartwarming story! After reading Take This Regret, it was really a privilege to be able to see the foundation for which Elizabeth and Christian started
I felt that the author did a great job keeping the characters true to what they were in Take This Regret, but at the same time depicting them as younger, more vulnerable, and more naive."Elizabeth had gotten under my skin

Exposed who I really was just by reflecting her light onto me."I really can't decide whether or not I love this younger Christian or the Christian I got to know well in Take This Regret better

Both had their flaws and both were completely love able
He definitely seemed more lost in this book, but he still had the same, admirable determination to go for what he wanted, no matter the cost."Joy had firmly taken root in my heart as a future unfolded before my eyes, snapped into place like the jagged pieces of a puzzle, one that didn't seem to fit but always belonged together."I liked that even at 18, Elizabeth was still extremely guarded and cautious with her heart

I had a lot of respect for her for not immediately giving in to her desires but not lying to herself about her wanting of Christian either
It was nice to catch a glimpse into a younger, carefree, Elizabeth, without the stress that was placed on her throughout Take This Regret."I'd never had that in my life, someone who I truly felt comfortable with

Someone who made me feel exposed, and somehow I was still okay with that fact."This was a really sweet prequel novella, and I once again have nothing but praise for A.L
Jackson in her talent of capturing the raw emotions of her characters
In her writing style, I really feel that she goes above and beyond with her descriptions and metaphors for different feelings and I could easily empathize with both Christian and Elizabeth."Being around him had become a risk I was willing to take."This book was chock-full of sexual tension, but in a great way because it is about the wonderful and terrifying risk of falling in love with your best friend

This is a quick and fantastic read and it is great because you don't have to have read Take This Regret before diving in to Lost To You


For an adorable romance that is guaranteed to sweep you off your feet, definitely give this book a look!

$REVIEW.: This story is extremely well written...until the end. (SPOILER ALERT!) The h/h characters are developed enough to become invested in throughout the story, however the heroine dies in the end by her husband's hand, leaving him in anguish and a growing daughter to look after. After that unpleasant cliffhanger, the next book in the sequel seems to be about Ethan's sister and his daughter. The thing is, I no longer care. I hate these kind of books, over 300 pages long that end with a lousy cliffhanger! I am deleting this, since I don't care what hapens next.

$REVIEW.: Jenna Bennett has done a fabulous job creating characters you will grow to love just as I have.  Savannah Martin is a true southern girl who's divorced her cheating husband and is now trying to start a new career in Nashville real estate.  When she shows up to show a house to a potential client, that client turns out to be bad boy, Rafe Collier, from her home town.  She's instantly attracted to Rafe, but is afraid of that attraction because Rafe is from the wrong side of the tracks.  The heat is on and Jenna Bennett doesn't disappoint.  This series has romance and mystery and each book is better than the last.  The characters are well developed and the plot doesn't disappoint.  I know you will enjoy these books as much as I did!
$SUMMARY.: You definitely won't be disappointed with the Cutthroat series!

$review_text.: As a budding author myself this book was well up my alley so to speak


Its obvious the author as taken a lot of time, thought and care into putting this book together
And here his effort has paid off in spades, the narrative is easy to follow and engages the reader right away! I have learned a lot from this book that I will be putting into to use in upcoming books


For instance how to use places like Amazon itself and Clickbank as a tool for inspiration and or guide for book ideas


This book as the title states is a step by step book, and for new authors or those lacking direction, this is what you need to follow and get a book done.This is a great book, and I highly recommend to all authors new and more established, everyone I think will gain something from reading this book.

$review_text.: **3.5 Stars**"Is it wrong that I got hard when you said hot dog?" I asked, leaning down to nip at her pouty lips."No more wrong than how wet my panties are from thinking about your hot dog
Turner and C*ck.""I like C*cker and Hoochie better.""It does have a nice ring to it, but let's bowl first."I loved the banter between Vaughn and Raven! They were hilarious! His nicknames for her were super cute, although I'm still trying to figure out the one he put on the cake.....Vaughn is basically a dead man walking


He knows his days are numbered so he doesn't form any attachments to anyone
Raven has been hurt so much in her past that she has decided to swear off men from her life, her heart and her bed

That quickly changes when she meets Vaughn F'ing Majors! These two start off being sex buddies and end up as so much more

I think these two were perfect for each other.The story seemed to drag a little at times and there were a few grammar issues but overall, it was a great book! Loved catching up with characters from the previous stories (especially Cooper and Farah)

Can't wait to read Nick and Bailey's story!

$review_text.: I have been waiting for this book forever, and I was not disappointed.Set in a future dystopia where children are taken from their parents and raised in unknown whereabouts until their eighteen and sent to God-knows-where, "Garden of Eden" was a blast to read.Eden has spent the last four years a prisoner in her own house with her best friend, Will, hiding from the Catchers
She dreams of getting out but doesn't take the chance that often
She a much better damsel in distress than I'd ever be


I think I would murder someone if I was trapped in an attic (V.C

Andrews' "Flowers in the Attic" much?)It was a trait I hated in Eden but one I have seen in so many people, myself included


We all tend to just accept things when we feel we have no control over them.This was what made Eden seem real to me though


Even though I was constantly screaming at her (even if it was only in my own mind), she was a REAL person
She had fears, doubts, love, resentment, and curiosity.Add in a dash of magic and a pinch of mystery - why do the Catchers take children anyway? - and this book was just..

rockin' awesome!In fact, the only reason this book earned a 4-star review from me is because now I have to wait for the next book in the series


How awful! But I certainly can't wait to read it.

It did a great job of defining the history and actuality of the Illuminati in a way that differentiates it from the conspiracy theory rants that defines it in modern culture.  It's like reading a religious document that actually makes sense.  But if your a Christian, Muslim or Jew, I hope you have an open mind because it says some things about those religions that explains why the leaders of those religions demonized the Illuminati for so long.

This book helps you to better understand the end times coming and things that have already happened. The only problem I have with the book is making references to the "Rapture" the author needs to spend some more time learning about the so called end times Rature... She could start by looking up Margret McDonald which should start a hole new study in it's self.  She make references to Jack Van Empi?? who is a slick willie asking for money. One only needs to look at his dress to see what he's about... She make references to Eye's to See & Ears to Hear.....Jack is a Wolf in Sheep's clothing ... But,  I did enjoy the book otherwise

$review_text.: Somewhere in this book there is a summary entitled "Reasons for stopping drinking". This summary is a recipe for a life well lived. The book tells the reader the author's journey through hell and back, through hell again and back again - many times - until she finally managed to arrive at a point where her real life started, her life well lived, where she can experience joy, freedom and happiness.This is an extraordinarily important book. It should be compulsory reading for all alcoholics, which of course is wishful thinking. Besides, until alcoholics have reached a certain point, nothing can make them accept the need for change. But I am only uttering words. And that's the true strength of this book, it is not just a book comprising words and sentences: this book conveys emotions - enormously painful emotions, but also emotions that create understanding and can lead to healing. This book is not only important for alcoholics, it is equally important for everybody who want to understand the world and the suffering of people who just can't live without drinking. Reading this book is a must for the loved ones of alcoholics, for their friends, relatives and workmates.This is a book I can't recommend highly enough!

Meet young Charlie-- product of too many foster homes, card shark, over-the-top presence, nicknamer extraordinaire-- who just is trying to keep herself in enough money at low-life chinese joint poker to afford her rat trap of an apartment.And spy on her neighbor. Doug is about to have a bad day. Although he's hiding away in his father's apartment, his life is about to change forever when he peeks in Charlie's spyhole just as Charlie is peeking out, and she starts to take over his life.Both of them need money, and so they decide to team up together with hijinks, bad nicknames, gastrointestinal distress, and a disturbing villain's handiwork ensues.Fun, with emphasis on body-function name-calling, insults, and banter.Add a most mysterious and supernatural villain and counterpart policeman, and you've got quite the successful mix.  It didn't quite get the 4 stars for me because some of the insult/banter wore on me after a while. I found myself skimming that to get to the good stuff action where charlie and Doug work together to take down the bad guys.I also felt Doug's POV and tendency to call people the same nicknames as Charlie kind of made their characters blur a bit when switching POV.Fun series, not safe for younger YA if worried about language and body function jokes.This Book's Snack Rating: Doritos for the punch of spicy insults on an addictively crunchable set of YA characters

Mortdecai
I wasn't disappointed

While not as tight or well designed as the first novel, the central character Charlie uses the same ironic, charming banter that makes these books unique.Since the author was an art dealer, there are several fascinating descriptions of art restoration and forgery techniques
Many have compared the Bonfiglioli writing to P.G
Wodehouse

As a nod of acknowledgement, Mortdecai mentions Wodehouse a couple of times in the novel.If you liked the first one, be sure to pick this one up as well.

$review_text.: I'm pretty divided on this story.Many factors have led me to close this book at the beginning. I really struggled with Nora. I was unable to identify myself with her slutty personality. Maybe a lack of context, background and material on the girl is the reason why. In fact, there is little details about who she is. We learn that she loves mythology, can not keep her pants on and her promises are not worth it... The perfect heroin!Her sexual aggressivity towards Alec and in their first intercourse did not sound erotic but vulgar. I was ready to surrender and say that this book was not for me. But...The appearance of Caleb has changed the situation.The story get darker. The author explores the myths of the creation of Adam and Eve, Lilith and I've embarked on a supernatural tale that began to really pique my curiosity.Hatred and rage around the two brothers' past has encouraged me to know more about them and what will happen.Henry is also a character that I found endearing and fun. By cons, Nora has never convinced me, despite its evolution. Females in this story are pictured like horrible bitches...maybe it's also why I've grind my teeth.However, I'm glad I persevered because I liked the use of the myth of Cain and Abel associated with fighting vampires and undead. But I would have liked more eroticism, this item comes a little too late for my taste.Lucienewbooksonmyselves.blogspot.fr

Lack of values brings us down to just animals.  The book is a warning to those who value Biblical teachings of moral behavior and the path to Sodom where anything goes and anything is OK.

The negatives are that there is a back story that is never explained.  This is a minor negative.  Also, the sex scenes are more graphic than I appreciate but not offensively so.  The far worse elements in the story are treated with tact and discretion.There are enough hints dropped that you think you know "who done it" with enough surprises to keep it interesting.

$review_text.: This book dives into the what we human's only can describe as the &#34;supernatural&#34;. This a pretty vague description of all that he talks about and attempts to describe in this book.He cleverly describes how we as humans percieve this other worldly spirit world where in reality it might actually just be another parallel universe. He describes these other universes as being just as real as our own and how they are more like different channels on your cable programing and our brains are the TV. Our brains can be tuned into different channels at different stages and phases of our lives, one of which, being when we die or perceive to die.The plot is relatively interesting.I would have liked to have gotten more detailed descriptions of the everyday life of the stoneage girl character but I understand the challenge of that since the book already is attempting to tackle an enourmous topic of the supernatural.Ultimately this a great book and I believe opens peoples minds and should hence be read with an open mind.

I liked the premise:  different marital crises and how people react to them and how they recover and move on.  I also thought the writing was excellent.  But while I read it all the way through and found it to be a pleasant read, I didn't really care much for any of the characters and this kept me from getting really invested in the outcome.  That said, this was a pleasant summer read and I will probably try other books by this author.

$REVIEW.: I had to compromise with myself on how to rate this book so I decided that the story was worth 3.5 stars and the editing (or lack thereof) was worth 0 stars. Unfortunately, the book is riddled with spelling mistakes, grammatical errors and the occasional sentence structure mishap but I decided to ignore those issues and not let them bother me.On the bright side ...I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It has a lot going for it - great characters that are well developed and extremely appealing and a good, action packed storyline. The protagonist, Mercy, is strong, loyal, feisty but vulnerable and confused and she has no clue who or what she is . The rivalry for her attention between two Alpha heirs' only intensifies her confusion as her emotions bounce from one extreme to another. Alec, her Bond Mate, is especially well written - I liked the way the author gave him a bit of a dark side. Mercy`s  life begins to unravel when tragedy strikes and a secret ability is revealed. The arrival of some nasty rogues and unwelcome family cause even more trouble for Mercy and her brothers who find themselves threatened by a familiar & hated enemy. When Mercy`s heritage is thrust upon her with no warning, she reacts badly and with near fatal consequences. The question is, will she be able to forgive those who deceived her - we shall see.The Pack is a good read even with the spelling & grammar issues. I intend to purchase the next installment - I really want to know what happens next with these characters.

Even with all that has been thrown her way she seems to somehow stay strong. As time has past since she lost her husband secrets that were supposed to stay hidden get revealed, Katie finds out that things are not always what they may seem.Eric is back in town for his best friend's wedding, it couldn't be more perfect timing since he just recently found his fiance in the bed with another man. He has come back hoping to win back the girl he loved that he had walked away from many years ago. Eric has made many mistakes in the past and has grown up since then, now he must prove he will not break her heart again.I thought this was an awesome debut novel and I am looking forward to reading more from Shelly Jones. This book did have a very realistic feel to it. I was laughing, feeling a little teary eyed, and a little angry during certain parts this book, it brought out my emotions. Eric is very swoon-worthy and how he is with Ava is the cutest thing. The ending was great with a perfect epilogue. Definitely recommend one-clicking.

$review_text.: This is an excellent book on the topic of forgiveness, and more than just a &#34;feel good&#34;, &#34;Let's get into a positive place about hard things&#34; book -- this one offers a concrete, step-by-step, practical approach.  I was really impressed with the studies they had done at universities and the results they achieved, even with people who started out by say, &#34;No, what happened to me was too terrible.  I will never forgive.&#34;  But we all know (or we suspect) that not forgiving keeps us in a state of mental, emotional, and sometimes physical unwellness.  So although we don't have to condone the acts we are looking to forgive, the forgiving heals us.  However this is not the kind of book you can read through, give some thought to and be &#34;done.&#34;  It asks you to do lots of writing (which is critical to this working), sometimes what might seem like repetitive writing, and it takes work. And it asks you to think about, remember, and feel some hard emotions.  It's not an instant fix.  It's a process, a healing process you put time and work into, but the results will be worth it.  Over the years, for various reasons, I have worked with several counselors and therapist.  Lots of times I felt like they were nice to talk too, but didn't give me real skills to solve what I was facing. This book does, I think.

$review_text.: I really didn't know what to expect when I began reading this novel, but a few pages in I was already hooked! The pace is so quick, and the storyline always changing, it's really easy to stay entranced. Not only did it take me on an emotional rollercoaster, but it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering what was going to be revealed or happen next. It was just such a simple story of love getting one through adversity with the perfect blend of sci fi and fairytale. Very well done Danvers!!

$review_text.: So who killed the evil construction tycoon?  Did he deserve to die because he left Bambi and Thumper homeless, or was there a deeper reason why he had to die?  Well...no deeper reason really, but this book was still a heck of a lot of fun!I admit that it was somewhat repetitive and you could even say that the author spent a lot of time hammering you over the head about certain things

 Nevertheless, the red herring put me off the scent of the killer, and I am always content when I do not guess who-dun-it in the first few chapters.I love the Massachusetts background; the characters are comfy and feel like they could be friends of mine

The romance really wasn't...this is the first heroine that really seemed to have meant to have sex just for the sake of sex - but in a good way, not a slutty way or an over explicit way  - as you will see if you read this book.I do hope that there will be more books to add to this one

 I would have liked to see some of the characters developed a little more fully and I really enjoyed a sort of `kick-butt' heroine that wasn't 25, a stone cold fighter with killer boobs!  It really helps that the secondary and tertiary characters are interesting, annoying and funny - just exactly what they needed to be for this type of book.Fun, light easy reading -just long enough to keep you engaged for a solid few hours -perfect for the beach!

$REVIEW.: Somehow, I waited to read this until recently and I was not disappointed. This is the start of a new series but is part of other series written by Jamie Magee. This is the story of Indie and her life. She is a fabulous character and the story is one of my favorites so far. This book is YA but as a more mature reader, I enjoyed the story and the characters without feeling like I was reading something for tweens. Indie is a troubled young girl with more than her fair share of problems- she not only has a witchy &#34;aunt&#34; trying to ruin her life but she also has supernatural issues. The book gets a bit twisted as Indie is dealing with some of her problems, but it is written in a way for the reader to see and feel what Indie is going through- a tangled journey to learn the truth about herself and her past. I cannot wait for more from Jamie!
$SUMMARY.: *sigh* another amazing book

$review_text.: Being born into a bootlegging family, Leo Gorcey's direction in life may have been predetermined


 A teenage fight where his opponent subsequently died would haunt Leo Gorcey

 That and his parent's divorce were probable causes for a turn towards alcoholism

 Lending a job as a Dead End Kid may have been aided by the fact that Leo Gorcey was, indeed, a natural for the role.This book examines the life and character of Leo Gorcey
 Full of antedotes, this is a riveting and often amusing tale of a talented but conflicted man


 A confused child, Leo, Jr

(the book's author) grew up with an oft abusive father wondering &quot;was Dad trying to make me the man he wasn't?&quot;  Instead, Leo, Jr


discovers that he is repeating many of his father's behaviors


 A search for discovering about a father becomes a search for discovery of self and learning how to come to terms with anger and forgiveness


 This is a powerful story, both for its history and for its emotional impact

 I recommend this book highly.

$review_text.: What an incredible Truth displayed and revealed for modern man to understand how necessary it is to study the Old Testament Tabernacle that is so clearly brought out in this book,revealing the Stature of Jesus Christ.  Every small detail having a spiritual definition and how it relates to mankind in their journey in the growing process, of growing unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. This book is exciting! What a tremendous privilege to own this book. It is not a curl up on the end of the sofa read, it inspires you to get your Bible, notepad, pencil and start your journey of learning!  It is an amazing revelation of the Stature of Christ. I highly recommend this book.

$review_text.: First off, I have to say that the cover of this book is absolutely gorgeous.  That combined with the rundown of the book, it was a story I was dying to read.In an effort to find out what happened to her sister while at the dancing academy, Vanessa begins attending the same school. Even though she does not care for it, she has a real talent for dancing and when she dances the world seems to fade away and the dancing consumes her.More people start disappearing and soon Vanessa realizes that her very life, like her sister could be in danger.What I liked:I liked the world of the ballet mixed together with nice elements of the supernatural.  The mystery in the story kept me wondering. It was definitely not predictable.What I did not like:No one else seemed to really be concerned with the fact that people were disappearing. If people began disappearing from a well-known Ballet school without even a little trace, wouldn't someone before now become suspicious? Wouldn't the parents of the ballet dancers come looking for their kids after not hearing from them? Or at the very least contact the police?Final thoughts:Dance of Shadows is an intriguing story that kept me reading to find out the way behind what was happening.  It was not as great as I thought it would be, but overall I did like the story and had fun reading it. The story does not end here though; this is the first book of a trilogy. Fans of magic/supernatural, ballet, and insta-love might want to check this one out.** I received this book from Bloomsbury USA Children's Books in exchange for nothing, but my honest review. Thank you!**

$REVIEW.: This book is seriously funny!  Oh my gosh, I laughed so hard at times that I got choked on my Hot Cocoa!In all seriousness, this book is a really good read.  The writing is superb, the characters are so well developed that they jump right out of the pages at you.  You probably know some of the characters, I know I did!It's a super quick read, but it is absolutely jam packed with compelling characters that will not only make you laugh, they will also touch your heart.If you're going through a divorce, or have ever been through a divorce, or are even thinking about a divorce, get this book.  You will relate to it, you will laugh with it, you will love it!

$review_text.: A revealing and instructive exploration of the delicate dance which inevitably takes place between cinematographer and director, greatly enriched by the inclusion of interviews with top cinematographers. Frost sheds much needed light on the rather mysterious issue of what a cinematographer actually does. Hint: it's more than just look through the camera- much more! Fascinating sections on such subjects as the colour palette of film, lighting for genre and the inside story of how to achieve "The Look" leave the reader vastly more educated about this key craft. This book will ease the trepidation of the first time director with tons of detailed technical information, nicely broken down into easily digestible chunks and lots of insight into how the technical can be applied toward better communication. At the same time, it will deepen the knowledge base of the experienced director leading to a better collaborative process. Without question, a real gem.

$review_text.: Certainly not everyone will appreciate a review of the South's own words, in declaring it's reasons for secession: the right to buy, sell, rape, steal, and own human beings

 Nor, acknowledge the role that enslaved people played in building America

 I truly appreciate the truth in this essay


 I would only add that while some of the reasons White Union soldiers fought may be vague and/or complicated, the reason why almost 300,000 Black men volunteered and fought was always clear- to end the heinous practice of enslavement, and to free themselves, their loved ones and fellow bondsmen

 Their courage cannot be overestimated, and is true cause for celebration.

$REVIEW.: The Dark Divine was an incredible book. It was heartbreaking, entertaining, and romantic all at the same time. The whole time I was convinced it couldn't get any better, only for it to go and do just that.Very few books make me cry. Which is weird considering I'm such an emotional person, but nonetheless, it takes something special to get me to shed a tear. This book had that "something special". I was seriously bawling like a baby throughout most of the book. Not all of the book was sad though. There were a few parts that were actually quite hilarious.I have contradictory feelings about Grace. There were times when I really liked her, and then there were times when I was so annoyed with her I would skip over her lines. Daniel was a completely different story. I think I may be in love with him. I liked Jude least of all. He was just unbelievably irritating. I mean, really? How is it possible for an author to write such an annoying character. In my opinion, Jude has absolutely no redeeming qualities.If you're a fan of Young Adult or Paranormal Romance, without a doubt, you have to check this book out. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: Another hot, sexy and fun story by Avery Aster. I loved Taddy's personality in Undressed, so I was excited to learn more about her. Her backstory is heartbreaking, and I can understand why she is so fierce and independent. Warner oozes sex appeal off the pages as Big Daddy, and it's not hard to see these two coming together. I loved the sparks between them from the beginning. The cast of supporting characters continue to deliver in this Manhattanite story. They add a rich layer of friendship, support and humor. I love Avery's writing style! It sucks me in, so that I can't put the book down until I finish it. Can't wait to read more from this series!*ARC received from publisher
