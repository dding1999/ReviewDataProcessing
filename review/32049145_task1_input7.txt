$review_text.: it seemed to work perfectly, however, when using it with skype, video would always freeze within a minute of a call.I had the most up to date driver but that did not solve the problem.after a quick google search, it appears that this is a widespread problem. The only solution seems to be uninstalling the logitech driver and software and using the generic driver from windows (i was using windows 8 but will probably work with 7 as well)So this skype certified webcam does not work with skype. by installing it without the logitech drivers and software, you lose all of the proprietary features you paid a premium for.Logitech, in my experience, always seems to mess up their driver/software side of their products. You can always wait it out and see if they fix it, however, this seems unlikely.overall, would only recommend it if it is on sale.

$REVIEW.: I tried the iRiver equivalent, but the interface was terrible and I had problems after I flashed the firmware (look at the discussion forums).  I then bought the Samsung, and it has been a dream - great price, size, sound and interface.  No support for playlists (hence, a 4), but I haven't needed them with the built in ability to select by author.  I am using it with Yahoo Music.  The Samsung and Yahoo are a perfect match.  Note - if you use podcasts go with the 1Gb model, 512Mb is not large enough.

$review_text.: Previously I've had great experience with "Extreme" SDHC line of memory from SanDisk. So I tried their SSD product expecting good performance. This turned out to be very disappointing. Sequential read and write speeds seemed to be Okay somewhere in the vicinity of 80MB/s. So I've copied an image of Linux installation from my old 40GB Intel SSD, and noticed right away that boot time was much slower than off of the Intel drive (although uses exact same OS image). At ~40 sec, it was more inline with a mechanical drive boot times. Weird, but seems like "seek" times are unusually slow with this drive. My 3 year old Intel drive boots same image in under 10 sec. So what's the point of paying premium for a small SSD vs mech HD if no clear advantage in boot times. Oh well, back to tried and true Intel drives for me...

$REVIEW.: This keyboard is designed with a few iPad-specific features and also works with Mac OS computers. It has a few of the same hot keys as the Apple iPad Keyboard Dock: escape becomes Home Screen, F1 is Search, F4 is Photo frame mode, F5 hides or shows the on-screen keyboard, F7 through F12 control media playback and eject becomes Lock Display (note: unless you've set a passcode, it just turns the screen off). Like the standard Apple Wireless Keyboard, it has a function key in the lower left-hand corner. Unlike either of the Apple keyboards, holding down the function key maps the 7890 - UIOP - JKL: - M&lt;>? keys as a 10-key numerical entry pad. The 10-key pad worked with Pages on the iPad (I don't have Numbers for iPad) and with Numbers and the basic calculator on my Mac. It did not work with either of the calculator apps I tried on the iPad.The keyboard was easy to set up and use on both my iPad and my Mac. The Mac required an extra step to identify it as an ANSI-type keyboard. I typically use a previous-generation Apple bluetooth keyboard with traditional-style keys. The Targus keyboard uses the same style of keys as the current-generation Apple keyboards and so is more like a laptop keyboard than a traditional keyboard. I do have the wired version of the newer Apple keyboard and use it when I'm running Windows, so I have some experience with this keyboard style. If you've never used one of the newer designs, you may want to find one to try out before you buy, particularly if you've never used a laptop keyboard.Most of the basic keyboard shortcuts (not requiring a mouse click) in Pages for the Mac seem to work in Pages on the iPad (use Shift and the arrow keys to select text). I've used this keyboard and Pages to write first drafts of this and two other reviews. I'll continue to use it when I have a need to write more than  a few lines on my iPad.Given the nomadic nature of the intended use, I think many users would have welcomed a protective cover or sheath of some kind.There are a couple of things I would change, but, being personal preferences, neither are serious enough to merit any points off.(1) I would like a caps lock indicator, preferably near the battery/connection light rather than on the key itself.(2) I would much prefer to have this keyboard in white or silver.In less-than-ideal lighting conditions, it is much easier to see where you are on the keyboard when it's one of the lighter colors. Also, back in the old days, the letters on keys were injection-molded and so never wore off. My experience with newer keyboards is that, especially if your body chemistry is slightly acidic, you may start wearing the letters off your most-used keys after a year or two of regular usage. The letters seem to disappear much faster on a black keyboard. It is also easier to tell when a white keyboard is gunked-up and just needs to be cleaned.I think this is a good choice for anyone who does enough typing on their iPad so as to crave a real keyboard after a while, who misses keyboard shortcuts, or who just doesn't care for the on-screen iPad keyboard.

$REVIEW.: As many of the other reviewers found, this device did not work when connected to my Windows 7 laptop via Firewire


As I look at the reviews, I can't find ANYONE who has connected successfully via Firewire


The instructions said there was an issue with Windows 7 Firewire drivers and that I needed to install the legacy drivers
I did that and the drive worked afterwards, but I could not copy my video files to this drive without Windows crashing every time without finishing ("Windows has experienced an unexpected shutdown")

As I think about this, it is not a good idea to use old drivers
My 5+ year old WD MyBook works with the current (nonLegacy) Firewire drivers; in fact the MyBook was online when daisy-chained behind this enclosure when this enclosure was not responding
I think this one is going to need to go back.For those who might buy this for USB use, my only complaint is the blue LEDs on the front are too bright; so bright that you can barely see the red LEDs that flash when the drive is moving data.

$review_text.: I was looking for a router that was not wireless to replace an aging router that acted as a gateway for my overly complicated home network and bought this, one of the few wired only routers I could find. Firmware lacks blocking to specific computers or sub nets which I use to secure my network from computer that have been blocked by my firewall attempting to access my network. I was never able to configure my network to allow access computers that were on other routers connected to this one so I put the old one back in place and put this back in the box. You however may live a simpler life and it might work fine.

$review_text.: Used it one time on a 40 mile offroad bike race.  Battery lasted longer than the mount.  I elected to use the handlebar mount, but about 20 mins in, the mount started to loosen.  Nice that it has thumb screws so I was able to tighten it while riding, but it continued to loosen quite frequently. After about 2 hrs of riding, the main mount on the waterproof case cracked and the camera went flying away. The battery still had some charge at that time. Retrieved it later.  The quality of the video was not bad for the money, but with a broken main mount, I now have a useless camera.  I think it is much more conducive to road riding, inside a car, or maybe a helmet mount would be less jarring.

$REVIEW.: I just received the SD750 for my birthday (thanks Mom & Dad!).  I've had it for several days and have taken over 3 hundred pictures and tons of video.  It now replaces my old Canon S400, which was a replacement for my antique Canon S110.  I've remained true to Canon because I can see the amount of work they have put into making each new generation of cameras "that much better."  First, the colors are so much crisper on the SD750 than in prior models, although some tweeking may be needed, you can always find a setting to capture the color you are after.  Second, the video quality is outstanding (at the highest setting, that is), and Canon finally took off the 3 minute cap to video recording to allow for longer videos.  Also, at the highest setting only, you can zoom in and out while recording video.  I love the 3 inch display that incorporates a shifting orientation so the picture is always upright.  I do wish that the camera came with a more powerful optical zoom... but I imagine I'll get that with the next generation.  And in the end, I have to emphasize, that this camera takes OUSTANDING pictures.  That's what a camera should do, after all.  Now for a quick rundown of improvements from previous models (for you Canon loyalists):- Much improved color- Faster picture taking and faster everything- Extended video capacity (to however much memory ya got)- Large LCD to appease the instant gratification generation- Overall improved picture quality (clarity, color saturation)A few small camera quirks outside of picture quality... the jog dial in back (trying to emulate iPod) is not the smartest addition and the "play" button is a little hard to hit at times.  Overall, I definitely without hesitation recommend this camera.

$REVIEW.: I've known the Polk Audio brand for over a decade now due to their wide range of speaker products but have not owned any of them

I did audition a pair many years ago and remember they sounded very good for the price
Up until now they have not had any headphones in their lineup so I was naturally skeptical about these..similar to when BOSE did the same

With that said one listen and that skepticism immediately disappeared

I was very surprised at the excellent sound quality

The sound is very balanced and clear allowing you to hear minute details especially in the background

The bass is deep and does not easily distort


The mids are nicely separated from the lows and highs

The highs are smooth and distinct with no shrillness


Overall the sound is not fatiguing which means it makes you want to use them for hours
They are also very efficient so I did not need a separate amplifier to drive them fairly loud when used with portable music players such as Iphone, Ipod, PSP etc.Build quality is very nice and the design is uniquely stylish mixing old school with modern


The headphones are not heavy or light but just right...it doesn't feel cheap because it has a good weight to it


They are comfortable and are a good size despite being an over the ear design
I have not had a chance to test the mic but the integrated volume  rocker dial/button on the body of the headphones is a nice design and works very well with my Iphone
Play/Pause by pushing the rocker dial/button is very easy but for track skipping it takes a little practice to time the button presses


Holding in the rocker also activates the Iphone's voice control

The detachable cord is a perfect length for portable use but may be too short for home use when attached to a receiver or amplifier
The included 1/4" stereo plug adapter and soft carry pouch is a nice bonus


Overall I would definitely recommend these excellent headphones.

$REVIEW.: After reading the reviews for another brand that I have always trusted in the past, I took another reviewers advice and looked into APC products.  Reading the guarantee/warranty side by side, I was shocked!  The other brand made it nearly impossible to actually get reimbursed if anything actually happened.  I live in a extremely mild weather area, so I am not worried about Mother Nature so much as I am the 20 year old wiring in my apartment.  When I have to put in a work order because the wiring burns out 4 40watt light bulbs in a month, and it takes them weeks to fix it (had to replace a lot of wiring), Yes I worry about the thousands of dollars invested in computers, and home entertainment. I think I found a new favorite brand.  The warranty was very understanable, and didn't have any shady, or confusing 'small print'.  A simple warranty/garantee that looks easy to use should I ever need to. Also, the product is well made, and came with a phone cord and a cable cord!

Images were flat and grainy.  Using the flash resulted in washed out images.  Once in a while we got a good flash photo, but nearly everything else was not acceptable given that we wanted to end up with 10&#34; to 20&#34; prints.  Ambient light was a problem in most situations.  Very noticeable aberrations and lack of detail anywhere near the edge of the frame.  Numerous images had a hint of 'fish eye' bending of people/subjects in the corners of the images.  Ended up returning it.  I really liked all the features packed in for the price, but in the end, it just didn't take acceptable photos.

$REVIEW.: I bought this mouse for my windows notebook as I had been using a blue tooth wireless mouse with my mac and liked the cord free approach.  This is a nice compact mouse with good universal (left or right) ergonomics.  Additionally, I am still on my first battery where as my other blue tooth mouse would drain two batteries every week.  The only negative is that you have to have the usb transmitter plugged into the pc and remember to turn the mouse off with a switch on the bottom, but other than that this mouse is great!
$SUMMARY.: Great ergonomics with economical battery usage!

$review_text.: My new A-DATA 8GB SDHC card works fine in my Canon SD800 camera, but wouldn't show up on my Mac desktop after I plugged it into my Sandisk MobileMate card reader. Enter the Sandisk MICROMATE, which turns out to have been designed to handle the newer, higher-capacity SDHC cards, as well as earlier generations of SD cards. The MicroMate is an efficient conduit between my A-DATA, Lexar, and Kingston cards on the one hand, and my Macs on the other. No drivers are needed -- it's all plug & play. The device has a little green light that powers on when the reader is inserted into a USB port. It comes with a transparent plastic cap that protects the USB plug; when you remove the cap to plug the MicroMate into your computer, the cap fits on and over the slot on the rear of the MicroMate (and over an SD card that you might have inserted there), so that you don't lose it. On a critical note, the cap also has an opening in its corner that lets you hook it onto a keychain -- an asinine design because if the reader detaches from the cap, you'll still have the cap but stand a good chance of losing the device itself. Other than that (and the caveat that this thing looks like it shouldn't cost more than ten or twelve bucks), the MicroMate is a nicely functional, able performer.

$review_text.: This is a superior GPS system.  It's got Tom Tom traffic that lets you view live real time traffic information.  You can also check the latest fuel prices.  Google searches for shops and businesses in a given area are available.  There's  five day weather forecasts and even safety camera alerts to let you know where speeding and red light cameras are.  The machine only took a minute or two to set up and configure.  I happened on to a screen that told the number of satellites transmitting to the machine and I'm the type that finds details like that interesting.  That same screen shows latitude and longitude in degrees and minutes.  The user guide was much more detailed and helpful than some other Tom Tom products I have seen.  I especially liked the section called "Making Your First Trip".  I enjoyed the touch and tap screen and the zooming features. The display is a little hard to read in the sunlight especially if for some reason you want to use it outside of the car.  All in all though if you need a new GPS this is a good system.

$REVIEW.: I found out that it is illegal to mount a suction cup to the front windows for the GPS in California.  As a result, I was searching for a different solution.I didn't like the beanie bag mount because it would slide off if I did a fast/sharp turn.I didn't go for the air vent mount because I tend to use the heat a lot....so I didn't want to blow hot air to my GPS.Both above solutions make the GPS hot during the summer with the sun hitting it.  And electronic hates heat...So...I decided to get this cup holder so that it doesn't expose to the sun.  I like it a lot.  I ended up buying another one for my other car for convenience in switching it back and forth.  The holder is made out of plastic, but the rod is flexible metal.

$REVIEW.: This TV is a beauty.  Big BIG screen with a narrow border.  Beautiful bright picture and that looks smooth with few artifacts when watching college football.  Also, I experimented with the 2D-3D conversion the first night I had it plugged in; for kicks I used 3D glasses I'd been hoarding from the theatre.  The Lion King Blue-Ray had an awesome picture and transitioned very well to 3D with the touch of a button (actually two touches, the TV asks you to confirm that you want to transition and cautions you against too much 3D).  Afterwards I tried this out on a TV show, The Walking Dead... this also worked pretty well (some scenes better than others).Overall, a really nice big TV for a very reasonable price.

$REVIEW.: The Maxell GENhd is a very portable drive with stylish looks and quality components.  I closely inspected this drive and found it contained a Hitachi Travelstar 5400 SATA 3Gbps hard drive with 8M cache.  It's no speed demon, but the same barebones Hitachi drive gets solid reviews across multiple websites.  It quickly recognized in both Windows XP and Windows 7 and easily formatted to both NTFS and FAT32.Pros:* Sleek, stylish* No separate external power cord required [NOTE: the lack of an external power cord *could* be an issue for lower voltage devices such as a netbook, but I have not tried it... just something of which to be aware.]* Only one USB plug on the end instead of two* Reliable brand hard drive inside* Disassembly easy if you wished to put a different SATA drive in itCons:* Only short cord included.  Should have included an extension or a 12" or longer cord IMHO. (-1 star)* A cloth sleeve would have been nice, but no deduction for it.

It comes with capture and editing software and has everything you will need to get started minus the HDMI/Component cables which you will have to provide yourself. Everything about this card is pretty average from it's features to its capture quality although it does have some pretty long render times with its video editor unless you have a monster PC.I would say its worth the $99 I paid for it but if you are an enthusiast and want perfection you might want to pay a little more.

$REVIEW.: UPDATE: After Six Months - July 07 - This is a review of AW300 - Amazon lumped all Slingshot reviews together after my original review, which was the first AW300 review.I've been using this bag for about 6 months and I am very happy with it. It is very well designed, well constructed & well padded. It is about the size of the backpacks that middle/high school-aged kids use, but it is fully padded and retains its shape. As advertised, it easily holds a large SLR with an 80-200mm f/2.8 lens attached, along with a lot of other stuff (e.g. a 18-70 lens, 50mm lens, SB-600 flash, a 1.4x teleconverter, cables, camera & flash manuals, batteries, filters, & memory cards, with room to spare).If you are not familiar with the Slingshot bags, this is a sling-type bag which is like a combination messenger bag/one-strapped back pack. It is worn on the back with the wide, well-padded shoulder strap across the front of your body from the left hip to the right shoulder. Then, to access your camera, you slide the bag around front, (this is easy to do) without removing it, like accessing a messenger bag or shoulder bag. The flap opens away from your body so it does not interfere with access, as a messenger bag or shoulder bag typically would, however. In this position, you can easily remove your camera while wearing the bag, though most of the rest of the storage compartments cannot be accessed without removing the bag. With a D80-size camera, it is easy to lift the ends of the padded interior dividers to access a lens (or two) or a flash in the main compartment.As some have noted in reviews of other sling-type bags, a sling bag is less comfortable than a backpack for heavy loads and/or extended use, but it allows convenient access to your camera without removing it. That is true of this bag as well, but this bag has a nicely padded wide shoulder strap, and most importantly, a waist belt that is padded at the hips which really takes a lot of the weight of the bag off your shoulder. After shooting more than a dozen of lacrosse games, wearing it the entire time (albeit, without the camera in it most of that time), I found the bag to be extremely comfortable. As compared to my previous sling bag, a Kata T-214, this is much more comfortable (the shoulder strap on that bag slipped around inside its padding, which was also too short, so I had to frequently readjust it to keep the nylon strap from digging into my shoulder). The Kata bag was also too small to hold my camera with an 80-200 lens mounted (which is what I mostly wanted it for).The only con I can think of is that it lacks a good place to strap a monopod (or tripod, though I don't think I would want the weight of a tripod with a sling bag). There are some loops on the middle of the bag (they are the darker stripes on the grey field in the picture of the bag), but they aren't well located nor do they seem well designed to hold a monopod (definitely not a tripod). I would like to see a couple of adjustable straps on the non-opening side to attach a monopod. Also, if you don't need/want to carry your camera with a large zoom attached, the smaller Slingshots would probably be good choices (though  I don't think they have the nice padded waist belt, which is really important if your equipment is at all heavy).UPDATE COMMENT: Although I would like attachments on the side of the bag for a monopod (as the smaller Slingshots have), the center loops work well enough with a velcro strap attached around the monopod.Overall, very highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I'm a 6'2'' adult male, and by no means of giant proportions


 Yet the H3 headphones kept slipping out of one ear or the other (or both), as the headset is clearly meant for smaller heads

 The ear pieces made a decent seal over my ears when they were in, but the size problem kept breaking the seal, flooding my ear canal with water, and eliminating sound from that ear

 I am thus far not at all pleased with my experience with them
 Can't the H20 Audio folks make the earpiece extensions a little longer?I am going to try removing the ear pieces from the plastic mantle, plugging them in my ears, and trying to hold them in place with a neoprene headband I just ordered -- this arrangement seems to work with the waterproof earbud design
 If that works, great


 Otherwise, these are going back

 Hopefully, the headband will also help with the enormous noise problem caused when rhythmically lifting and submerging my head during  any stroke but backstroke (and kickboarding)
 I listen to podcasts, and even for the few seconds in which both ear pieces stayed in before popping out from the size issue, it is extremely difficult to hear during these strokes.

Everything is nice except for one thing: the non-movable outlet on the inside of the strip near the power switch prevents it from lying flush against the wall. So for me it ended up being a 7 outlet strip because I prefer to have the strip against the wall, not jutting out. And that's impossible if you plug something into that inside, non-rotating outlet at the top near the power switch.

$review_text.: What a nice kit - $350 for it all, just $20 more than the black version. I do like this white version better - it's slick. I would almost think that apple designed this camera.I read a bunch of reviews before taking the plunge and most of them just bashed on it's auto focus speed. Then everybody agreed that the new firmware made it so much better. Well I was skeptical about the AF issues, couldn't be that bad, must be DSLR owners bashing a camera that's more for the point and shoot crowd. I was mostly right - it's not a big deal, with this update it's perfectly acceptable. You shouldn't be using the most complex algorithm for focusing in night scenes either way - it's just not the smart way to go. And yes the competitors probably fair better, but this is/WAS it's only issue. The price is amazing for such a feature rich camera that is so small too - it is heavy though, one wouldn't think that when looking at the small slick metally white body. For me that's a plus, won't make me forget I am holding it and throw it/bump it by mistake.It shoots some great photos in low light conditions - NO FLASH necessary. I was surprised it was able to capture such magnificent pictures at night, in near dark conditions. It's got a fancy night scenery mode that helps a lot in such cases too. The size of the sensor is probably the real reason though.The battery is not the greatest though, you might need to order some extra ones. With a 16gb sd card it can shoot 480 Raw + Large JPEG pics, but the battery probably won't last that long, more like 160 shots - but I am still playing around with it.Very happy with my first mirror-less camera, I never liked the bulkiness of DSLRs, just too much to carry around. I bet the next version will be even better - I just hope it's price is as good too.

I needed this in a pinch after my beloved spare Mighty Mouse finally clicked its last click, but am tempted to return it because it just is NOT a good fit for me.First off, there is nothing necessarily MAC about it except the color, perhaps.  It has a wireless USB dongle tucked inside it that seems to work just as well on my PC.This device lacks the tracking and precision of the authentic Mac mice, as well as the in-hand feel.  The optical scroller at the top is very unreliable and jerky, and almost worthless in my experience.I am going to bite the bullet and spend the good money on a real Mac mouse.  I wanted this to be an inexpensive alternate, but it just falls so short of being acceptable that I am dissatisfied.

The controls are cheap (you can feel the panel moving behind the facade when you push a button, threatening to break off), setup is confusing, and the display is too small to be useful as a clock. Also it lacks a backup power source, making it not a great choice as an alarm. When the alarm does go off, the display flashes maniacally. Why? I want to wake up to music, not fireworks. I don't understand why an HD receiver can't be put into an existing clock-radio chassis with proper controls, display size and alarm.Couple days later... the radio alarm has stopped working.

$review_text.: For half the price as a Roku 3 it is a good entry level gizmo if you have no experience with Roku. I got it specifically so I could stream amazon prime to the TV. Unsure if I will keep prime when my first year is up I did not want to spend $90 on the gizmo. If I decide to keep prime after a year I will probably upgrade to the most current version at that time.It was easy to set up. I rated down one star because it is rather slow, and kind of a pain to enter my log in info with a remote each time I wake up the Roku, once logged it it's stays logged until it goes to sleep after so much inactivity. ( or maybe I have not learned how to use it properly) it did not have any instructions. Also keep in mind this unit only plays HD up to 720P. Also I has closed caption capabilities which is big plus for me.

$review_text.: I bought these headphones after trying a few other designs from Sony as well as other companies. My day to day headphones are the Sony MDR-EX75 earbuds, which I LOVE, so I was looking for something similar in a waterproof package (I shorted out a couple pairs of the EX75s while working out).These were EXACTLY what I was looking for. Same great sound, comfort, etc. All in a package that was waterproof and stayed on my ears (better than Sony MDR-AS20J Sport Headphones).So far I'm convinced about 10 of my friends to get the same earbuds and they ALL can't work out without them now!

$review_text.: My real-world scenario for the H70 is in a new i7 920 build with Gigabyte X58 MB.  I wanted a stable 4GHz OC for video work, but wanted lower power consumption and temps when doing less demanding work, hence enabled the i7 variable multiplier feature which works very well.  Tried two very good air coolers but neither could handle the 4GHz cooling demands without thermally shutting down the CPU.  The H70 provides another 15-20 C headroom over the air coolers and made it possible to sustain 4 GHz with a high (PRIME - mixed) CPU and memory load and about 10 C headroom before shutdown.  In everyday use, CPU runs in the 30's at stock speed, 40-50's at my OC voltage settings.  Video encoding drives this higher but not to the point of shutdown.  I count this a great success given how hard I want to push the OC and the notoriously hot CPU I am using.Installation was easy, actually overall a bit easier than big air coolers, and there is much more room around the CPU now to get air to the North Bridge, which runs pretty hot at my OC voltages and speeds.I did swap out the stock fans for quieter units, in my case a Noctua and a Enermax ultra quiet case fan.  Put the Enermax on the CPU fan header since it is a PWM unit and it blows out through the radiator from the inside of the case.  Put the Noctua on a fan controller since it is on the outside of the case and keep it at about 60% speed.  Net, I have a very quiet setup with adequate cooling for some serious speed, sweet!  Liked it so much bought a second H70 to use on a build with my son.  Good stuff.

$review_text.: I use these buds for physical activity at the gym. They hold up well to the physical movement and stay snug in my ear (what more do you ask of ear buds?). They're inexpensive so I get my money's worth every time I order a pair (they last about 6-9 months for me with regular use). After a bud breaks, I then cut off one strand and use the single bud for cycling (I like to leave one ear budless so I can hear cars, people, animals or whatever).

$review_text.: Decided to picked these up since they were advertising with "BASS BOOSTER" and the price was reasonable.I wasn't expecting much but did wanted a spare earbuds for listening to music at school. The sound quality is pretty good and the durability, despite being yanked during running couple of times, it hasn't broken down yet. The "bass booster" idea is quite exaggerated here. While vocals are clear, the bass did not performed what I imagined it to be. Sure it's cheap and it works well, but don't look for superior sound quality with high quality "bass".Another downside is that the earbuds, at least to me, hurts my ear when listening for 10-15+ minutes. They are quite large and can be annoying, if not hurtful, after couple of minutes of used. The earbuds itself, which are plastic and rough, pushes against my outer ear and can be discomforting depending on how I position it. I have to leave it hanging almost outside to avoid any pain from the rough earpiece.SOUND: 7.5/10-high and lows are not as crisp on certain songs.BASS: 5/10-poor bass, and not that much better than standard earbuds that comes with apple iphones/androids.-not punchy or controlled.DURABILITY: 9/10-will last. I still have it for over 2 years.COMFORT: 4/10-It is annoying and they are larger than the regular size earbuds.-Does not position well on certain ears as they can be discomforting.RECOMMEND?-No, save your money and buy a better earbud with better sound and bass.

I have a nice Behringer Mixer, Behringer Truth Studio Speakers, Yamaha Motif keyboard, all high dollar items and I was getting a light buzzing sound from my speakers, however faint.  This cleared everything up.  It's very sturdy, has a lot of weight to it, the LED is pretty cool and shows you how much power you're getting to the unit. I really like it. IT comes with a nice long power cable on it also so you're no stuck having it 1 ft from the wall if you don't want. Well worth the money and definitely conditions the power you get as my recording studio is crystal clear now, and I mean its totally silent when there is no music being played.  Impressive.

I mostly do macro photography and this head with an Adorama Macro Focusing rail save me lots of time adjusting narrow deep of field situations. It's really easy to move around the camera with one hand, and at least for me it's not so hard to do it as other reviewers point out. The quality is superb and really don't find any negative aspect in the operation of the product, the only problem with it might be its bulky and a little heavy if you plan to use it outdoors.

$REVIEW.: There is no doubt that this camera is for budget conscious people who would like to venture out into world of digital photography. This will surely make you feel that you are carrying a DSLR around your neck and look cool. This camera however is not going to win any award nor can rival any Sony's Alpha lines of DSLRs or Canon DSLRs like the Canon 60D. The lens is of fixed type. It has wide angle and extreme zoom (26x) features. It cannot be removed or interchanged like what I have seen in the past with the Sony NEX-F3 models but boasts super high zoom with Optical SteadyShot image stabilization reduces blurs to some extent.Having said, there are some "good points" in the camera that most other brands in this price range cannot offer those are but limited to Sony's Intelligent Auto mode which does a fairly good job with the scene types and automatically configures the camera to take a photo. Most consumers who are new to digital camera photography will find this feature very useful and it does take good photos with minimal knowledge of photography. The menu system on the LCD guides you and prompts you to pick the scenes if you do not like Auto which works very well and takes decent quality photos.Another good thing which amateur photographers would definitely love is the ability to use standard AA batteries, no need to worry about a charger. Just purchase AA batteries when they die (which are available almost in any store) when you are out on vacation. Sony also included the capability to use standard SD/SDHC memory cards and these are inexpensive and easy to get in any electronics store.Here are some of the still resolutions that this camera can capture:1. 5184 x 3888 (20.2 MP, 4:3)2. 5184 x 2920 (15.1 MP, 16:9)Most of us do not print the photos unless they are nice and needed to be shared with family members without a PC or Tablet. I personally prefer the 16:9 ratio images as these tend to fill my TV in the living room accurately even though it is not the highest resolution. The 16:9 wide also fits nicely on 10.1 tablets. The camera also is capable of capturing Hi-def 720P video 1280x720, which is not the 'greatest' quality but still very good. It does add some amount of lens motor noise when you zoom in and out onto the microphone which I found annoying.PROS[+] Decent quality photos with 20.1 MP resolution for the price[+] AA batteries are easy to find and replace[+] Large easy to use LCD display with intitutive menu system[+] Feels like DSLR and while it is heavy it's got a good grip and shoulder strap included[+] Optical image stabilization works relatively well for short close-ups[+] Flash works great! and takes good photo indoors when used appropriately[+] Uses Standard SD/SDHC memory cardsCONS[-] No optical viewfinder (Too much to ask for this price range)[-] Macro photography is not that great[-] No HDMI port and the USB cable is properitery[-] You need to have a very steady hand for taking extreme zooms Tripod needed[-] Flash has a manual button it does not auto pop out when taking photos[-] Lens cover must be manually removed otherwise it will damage the lens - watchout for this[-] AA batteries while convenient it adds a lot of weight to the already bulky body[-] LCD preview is grainy at extreme zoomsMy personal feedback on this camera is that while the camera *does* have all the basic needs for amateur photography and will suffice for casual users but this definitely is not for serious photography enthusiasts. I would rather buy a DSLR by spending little more and get super high quality photos sacrificing the extreme zoom that this camera boasts. IMHO, if you compare the photos taken with this camera and some high end DSLRs like Canon 60D you will find that extreme zooms which are well past 10x tends to be blurry anyways as it needs super steady hands or on tripod. Some of the high quality images from DSLRs can be digitally zoomed (Post processed in a PC) and cropped later on giving the same zoom effect offered by extreme zoom lens cameras.I would rather go for a smaller camera that has about 5x to 10x manageable true 'optical zoom' which takes steady photos which is easy to carry rather than lugging this quite large DSLR type body which happens to be not a DSLR! not to mention sub-par subcompact pocket camera performance in most areas!My suggestion is to keep shopping as there are better ones that SONY makes for this price range which are less bulky.
$review_summary.: DSLR Look but subpar performance!

$review_text.: I actually meant to order the Philips 7-incher (brighter screen, $20 cheaper, bulkier), but somehow I got confused when I placed the order...this one looked beautiful so I was pretty psyched anyway and was definitely going to keep it.  I was planning on using this for work, as I get a lot of DVD's from clients - so I popped one of those in and guess what?  It came up as "invalid disc".  It's supposed to play the majority of formats, and I triple checked the disc in my other dvd players, and it worked in my Panasonic DVD/VHS combo player.  A store-bought DVD worked fine (although I didn't play it much more than the first menu) so I know it's not broken.The first reviewer also noticed that it doesn't play a bunch of homemade DVD's, so I will confirm that here - if that's gonna be a deal-breaker for you then stay away.  BTW, the DVD I was trying to play was made on a Philips burner.  I didn't bother to test it with any others.

$REVIEW.: This cable is very long, and works fine as a data cable.  For charging, even with the OEM 2Amp charger, this only charges maximum around 600mA (standard USB rates).  Since cords for Samsung tables are so hard to find other than OEM, this cord is still a good value to me.  However, if you are really looking for a fast charger to replace the OEM, the 'APK Electronics' version with the power plug does provide a full 2Amp, so look into that.This cord does fit nicely in my Note 10.1 and Tab 7.  The cord is long and does provide some charge.  If you battery is half depleted, it will take pretty much a full night to recharge.  I started my Note 10.1 at ~15% going to bed and in the morning it was around 85%.  Since this fits my normal use, the cord is fine for me, and it frees up my OEM cord to keep in my travel bag for quick charges.The three stars is primarily due to it being advertised as a Charge and Sync Cord.  It is truly not a Charge cord, only a Sync cord.----Update:  I did contact the seller and they advised that they will be revising the design (expected in March).  For the time being the refunded the cord cost, and offered to send out the new cord upon request once it is ready.  I would rate the seller as 5 stars.  I have upgraded the product rating to 4 stars, mainly due to the excellent handling that they have provided for the product.  I still can not make it 5 stars, only because at this time it does not currently act as a charging cord.  If the description is changed to not describe it as a charging cord, then consider this a 5 star review.  Otherwise, I will change it to 5 stars after getting and trying the new cord in March.

$REVIEW.: I am a pretty tech-savvy consumer.  The basics of this printer are pretty plug-n-play.  Looks good and I liked the black color.  The two piece laser cartridge is not a big deal, but is a little tricky unless you pay attention.  The instructions are poor, but not too difficult to figure out.  I connected it to my router and the DHCP Server worked great.  All the functions work well, although I have not been able to fax directly from my PC yet, for some reason.  For actually using this unit to its fullest, reading the owner's manual (in PDF on disk) is an absolute must.  Unfortunately, the owner's manual is almost indecipherable in parts and pretty overwhelming, even for me.  For my parents, forget it.  For example, you can pretty easily figure out how to set the current date and time right from the unit, but you will never know how to change "PM" to "AM" without hunting through the manual. The manual confusingly refers to setting features up pages ahead of where you are.  For example, you may be reading about setting up the unit to receive faxes on page 43 and it will refer you to a critical setting on page 64 in the middle of the instructions. Then you must scroll through the PDF manual, see what is referred to on page 64, and go back to page 43.  Doable, but needlessly painful.  Faxing directly from the unit is counter-intuitive and once again requires a trip to the Owner's Manual.  For example, rather than putting a document in the auto-feeder, pressing Start, and being prompted to enter the telephone number, you must hit Fax, Start,enter the telephone number and hit Quickscan.  Not a big deal once you know the secret, but counterintuitive.Many of the unit's settings can be set up over the network if you connected it to the router -- a USB cable is unnecessary if you connect it to the LAN.  The setup page opens in your web browser.  One problem:  access to the web page is password-protected.  If you don't look through the owner's manual, you will never know what the default USER ID and Password are.  I suspect that my inability to fax directly from my computer is the result of some settings somewhere, so I will dig through the Owner's Manual some more. Some of the "big" extras of this unit are not explained at all.  You can set the unit up to scan directly to an FTP server, but does not explain why you would do that, what it is, etc.  Same for Samba Shares.  I have no idea what to do with it.  Overall, a nice unit, packed with features for a very cheap price.  Looks good, has small footprint, and seems versatile.  Takes a while to figure everything out, though.

Also, while the device supports an Airplay-like mirroring service for Android tablets and phones, I found it to be frustrating to use since it takes several tries and minutes to get a connection, but once connected seems to work well. But since it takes too much effort to connect, it's not worth using that feature.
$SUMMARY.: Pretty good for a stand alone player.

Thankfully this was all we needed to adapt.  In the future we'll upgrade the PSU but for now this is doing exactly what we need.Good build quality, great price - we're very happy.

$REVIEW.: Just received my Samsung PX2370 and had to comment on this monitor. First off - two words: Get it! It is probably the nicest monitor I have seen with an outstanding picture. I currently have an array of monitors by Sony, Samsung, and Apple (a 23" Cinema Display) and this new monitor is far and away superior to any of them.Pro's:Thin ScreenLight weightElegant designOutstanding pictureSuperior ClarityTrue 1080p resolutionLED backlightingFast, easy setupCon's (and they are minor issues for me)Monitor adjustment buttons are mounted along the back right side of the screen. Just a tad awkward to use, but it does make for a clean design esthetic on the front of the monitor.No VESA mounting. In fact, the base's column does not appear to be removable. Only the round base plate is removable.As others have commented, on a shaky or less than sturdy desk the monitor wobbles/teeters on its base. Not a problem for me.The default brightness is extremely high. You will definitely need to adjust your display settings (took me less than 3 min.) to provide the optimal view.While this may not be the cheapest 23" monitor, when all is said and done the picture quality will totally win you over. HD videos look amazing on this monitor. The clarity is something to see and with my Mac Mini, the desktop and icons truly have almost a 3D quality to the images. If you're hedging due to the price - don't. It's money well spent.

$review_text.: I just got this so I'll give some first impressions.  I'll come back in a month or two to fill in more details.In short, this is the camcorder you've been waiting for: vivid, almost broadcast-quality home videos.  OK, that's assuming you know how to shoot steady and well-framed videos.  The camcorder with its three CCD chips gives you the technical superiority over your next-door neighbors, but ultimately if you shoot trash, you get trash.  But for those of us who know how to shoot like a pro (e.g., no in-camera zooming, steady and slow pans, no in-camera special effects), the results are simply amazing.  If you, for example, are a serious amateur home-movie maker or an aspiring filmmaker, you'll definitely love this camcorder.Because this is an affordable camcorder, Panasonic seems to have cut a few (minor) corners.  Indoor/night shots are no better than the average consumer 1-chip camcorder.  Of course if you have plenty of lighting, you'll once again reap the benefits of having 3 CCDs to capture light.  But if you just use existing indoor lighting you won't find this working wonders.  Also its optical zoom is lower than many newer camcorders.  As always, digital zoom is next to useless.The camcorder is pretty easy to set up and use; no Ph.D. in VCR programming required.  For this review I just wanted to focus on its main selling point, the 3-chip video capture system.  Other amenities include manual focus, 2MP digital still camera, remote controls, etc.  Battery life seems average, after you cycle the battery properly a couple times.If you want to take beautiful (outdoor) videos and don't have a fat wallet, you should definitely consider getting this camcorder.NOTE: From what I read, the cheaper PV-GS120 model foregoes the manual focus ring, the wired remote and the flash.  I assume that model has the same video quality as the GS200.
$SUMMARY.: Finally, an affordable pro-quality camcorder

$REVIEW.: I have four pairs of these.  They are OK for music if it is just casual listening, if you want to jam these are not your speakers.  On the Theater side they make good rears.  I have them paired with RC85i speakers for fronts right and center speakers.  I am driving them witha Yamaha RX673.  Installation is very easy, mostly if you have a dremel with a circular cut attachement.I painted my RC85s which have the same type of grills.  I thought I would give you my painting experience. I read extensively online and decided to try the Prevail sprayer to color match to my walls as that seemed to be the common suggestion. That was a waste. It was a mess, it sprayed horrible, I strained it and thinned it several times starting at 3 to 1, and going to 5 to 1. I gave up and threw the sprayer away.Out came the foam roller, bingo worked awesome:* I was using Porter paint (color matched to my walls) with no thinning* keep the roller fairly dry - this was a standard white foam roller from Home Depot* I rolled the frames and the grills* if you plug holes in the grills, roll it with a dry foam roller and it sucks the paint right out.* I had a couple holes that were plugged and the roller would not unclog, but a little canned air worked well.* I painted six speakers in about 30 min, they look like it was a factory paint job

The sound is also very good, it is not going to be on par with the ear buds that cost 300 dollars, but it is very good and has a very balanced sound, with good bass that is not too overwhelming. My ears would start to hurt whenever I would wear ear buds for an extended period of time, however I do not have that problem with these.

$REVIEW.: __The Gomadic's description as a fast, portable charger for my Kindle DX seemed to be the answer to my needs. I don't usually buy used electronic items like this, but a used &#34;very good&#34; [sic] charger was all that was available. The shipment arrived as expected, packaged in a bubble envelope and appeared to be in good condition. Appearances can of course, be deceiving. It failed to provide a charge. I printed the return labels and sent it back via UPS as instructed, at a cost of only $1.72.  Am awaiting a credit for the purchase, which I am informed, should be accomplished within 14 days.__Recommendation: Purchase the Amazon 5W USB Charger ($9.99 new), plus the replacement  USB to Micro USB Cable, ($9.99), which is shipped with the Kindle. This unit has fixed electrical prongs, rather than the folding or retractable ones common to &#34;on the road&#34; units. (In my experience,fixed prongs are far more reliable). Price for both shipped together: $19.98 plus tax. If you are a Prime member (and if you aren't, why not?) -two-day shipping is free. I have just ordered the two items, as I should have in the beginning.As for the slightly longer time needed for this unit to fully charge the Kindle: I'm old, but I can still afford to wait.

$REVIEW.: Let's face it, the features on this camera are great, but when applied, the great features are overshadowed by the poor performance and horrible tech support.If you want a camera that generates a false alarm every time the light in the room changes, or, each time the camera switches between infrared and regular, then this camera is for you. One camera will generate between 4-30+ false alarms a day depending on how many times it switches in and out of infrared, how many times lights are turned on and off in the area and how quickly the light outside is effecting the light inside. ( sun behind trees for example ) Sure, you can lower the sensitivity to avoid changes in lighting, and also enable motion compensation, but the IR to regular and regular to IR switching will still generate a false alarm, and at lower sensitivities, the camera will only really pick up motion about 3 feet in front of the camera, beyond 3 feet there could be 100 people moving about and the camera will not pick it up.Tech support at Foscam is the worst I have experienced, it is almost as if they grabbed a random person off the street to field my call. I literally knew more than they did after a few hours of working with this camera. The simplest of questions could not be answered. If they tell you they will call you back, don't bank on it, it wont happen.Also, be prepared to stay on hold for at least 30 minutes before anyone picks up, once that person picks up, they will have you wait another 30mins to 2 hours for a callback while they find a random person off the street to field your call.Stay far away from this camera, Foscam surely is aware of these false alarm issues and either does not have the desire to fix it, the ability to fix it, or both.

$REVIEW.: I bought this a couple of days and at first I was wary until I finally installed the wireless on the machine.Before then, i had bought a 2gb sd card and put some pdfs on there. I was disappointed when the machine wouldn't read them initially and soon became a little frustrated.After the wireless update to whatever the lookbook is supposed to be from, the lookbook had a new kind of shelving system for the book. (sort of like goodreads version) and it had a doc tab which i found out that 's where it puts all the pdfs of your books.i haven't seen if it'll do the epub file yet, but reading the books seem rather easy to put on and to bring up once the book updated.It took about twenty minutes for the lookbook to update, but afterwards it was pretty cool. I want to figure out how to get rid of some of the books on there (it came with 25 old books), but other than that, i do like the way it feels and reads.I had to turn a couple of pdfs sideways to get a good screen but most times it's pretty darn good.The only thing i wish is that it had an audio function, but it's color and that's awesome in itself.Now i did read some of the reviews and the buttons could be just a tad bigger, but other wise once you get used to the side buttons, it's really okay to deal with for the price i paid. the battery life is only four hours but i'm cool about that. (I ride to chicago and back and that's all i really need.)the really great thing about this is that i picked this bad boy up for $40 at CVS! (yes, with my extrabucks card).

$REVIEW.: I will preface this review by saying that I do not know that much about headphones, but I really love these.  I purchased them because of the price and the reviews on amazon and other websites, expecting to receive a mediocre set of headphones that I would use for a while until I had enough money to get better ones.  However, these are exceeding my expectations.  They aren't noise-cancelling but they drown out loud noises outside of my office.  Additionally, the sound quality is fantastic.  I turn the volume down extremely low  and I can still hear the music clearly without any background noise.  The base is great, and doesn't drown out the rest of the music.  All in all, extremely pleased with this purchase and I would highly recommend these to anyone who doesn't want to spend more than $100 on a set of headphones.

The card does exactly what it is supposed to do, turn the Nook into a full fledged tablet with all the bells and whistles
I can tell you from personal experience, the seller provides free upgrades and personal hands on tech support, via an open forum, (get that N2a?), email, voice, or remote logon

All this plus a money back guarantee, makes it a no brainer.

After almost dropping my iPad several times I knew I needed something to keep it in my hands.When searched Amazon, I found several different styles of handgrips, but after pouring over them and their reviews for certainly too much time, I decided to go with the the Grabbit. After using this grip for the last two weeks, I can say with all confidence that I made the right choice. Here's why:1. The whole thing is well-built. The case fits like a glove and has no give with my iPad. I even tried my hardest to shake it out (over my bed of course) and it stayed put.2. The leather hand strap is comfortable and because it has sizing options, it fits well. Unlike what some other reviewers had mentioned, I didn't even need a "breaking in" period with it. Incidentally, I had an appointment at the dermatologist today and the nurse had a handgrip for his iPad that was made of neoprene. I asked him how he liked it and interestingly enough he told me that it worked fine, but was uncomfortable because it was too tight and had no adjustment options. Looks like my obsessive review reading paid off.3. The unit definitely adds some heft to my iPad, and I assumed I'd take it off at night when I bring my iPad home to read iFunny, but it really doesn't bother me at all. I actually just leave it on all the time.4. The included front cover, which I thought I would never use, is actually incredibly useful. I just pop it on and throw the whole thing in my bag in the morning. Because it's a hard-case, I don't have to worry about my iPad getting bonked or cracked as I fumble to my classroom in the dark.All in all, this Grabbit case was exactly what I needed. It's well made, fits perfectly, and has made my workday just a bit easier.Highly Recommended.

$REVIEW.: This case is perfect, especially since our daughter love  the color pink uses the iPad mini more than we do. The plastic part snaps together nicely. Then the hard pink silicone cover goes over it. I was worried that the silicone cover might slide around or try to come off, but it keys into the plastic case at numerous locations. The silicone covers the home button on the iPad mini, but the button is still easily accessible. It makes them out of site for children who have never played with one. The stand on the back seems good and sturdy. It also clips down flush when not in use. Angles are adjustable too. The charge port is accessible with the case installed on the iPad mini. I don't see any reason to remove this cover/case now that it is installed. I highly recommend this cover/case for all iPad mini owners especially with kids.This is a great gift too so grab one or buy any time of the year.; courtesy of great shield store.(  Up date march 23 ,2014 )still works great for her

Of course, they are not precisely like those huge powerful ones--they aren't supposed to be.  However, if you turn the volume completely up on the iPod in the house, it's too loud.  About 3/4 volume is plenty.  The sound quality is amazing for such a little product, and this is true for the sound from the computer as well.Holds charge well, seems durable, and sounds good.  Can't ask for much more from portable speakers.  I'd recommend these to anyone I know with no problem, and daughter is already telling all her friends about it.

The material it's made of is of high quality, as is its construction. It won't fall apart after a few uses.My only gripe is that this sort of sunctions up in your ear, which doesn't really allow outside sound to get in. It's perfect if you want to enjoy music in a noisy environment, but a little dangerous if you're jogging with it on a crowded street.

$REVIEW.: I've been searching for options for headphones that I can use while sleeping. The SleepPhones are a good solution.Main points:- They can also be used for outdoor activity in the cold weather such as for jogging, etc.- The opening the back is not bulky, although you can press the velcro together or choose not to depending on how flat you'd like it to lay. However, I sleep on my side and this may feel uncomfortable to those who sleep on their backs all night.- The opening in the back allows for easy access to the individual speakers. The speakers are flat and sewn into squares of felt. You can pull back on the individual cords for each speaker in order to draw the speakers further back in the headband. There is one final square of felt that sits at the back of the headband and it acts as a gentle, flat cover for the "Y" part of the main cord where it branches to the two speakers.- Because the speakers can come out from the back, this allows you to throw the headband into the wash.- The band is not too thick or wide, so it only covers what it needs to. You could choose to have it cover your eyes as well if you wanted.Tips:- Put them on, open up the port in the back, and tug gently on the cords until the speakers rest where you want them to in the headband.- I had read that these tend to be loose on people. I purchased this extra small size. I am an adult male who is 5'6". These felt a little on the tight side but I still felt that I did the right thing in buying this size because I could at least stretch them a bit by leaving them stretched over something during the day in order to force some slack into them.- Pay attention to the code in the title of the different SleepPhones. For example, I am reviewing the ones here that have "SP4GS" in them. As far as I can tell, the "GS" at the end signifies "gray" and "small". This is worth knowing in case you are ordering headbands for more than one person.In the long run, I don't think these are going to work out for me. They are wonderfully designed, but the square patch of felt that encases each individual speaker is still enough that I feel it pressing into my temple and it is enough to distract me. I do not fall asleep easily so I'm really in need of the absolute most subtle product available. This product is well-made and should work for the majority of people, I just am more sensitive than most.

$review_text.: I bought this for my iPad 3 because I have a Bamboo stylus and wanted to have a case that would carry the stylus as well.  The rotating function and the swivel stand works just fine.  But one minor issue is that when you prop up the iPad to view it as a stand, the front cover becomes the base of the stand.  And the front cover is where you attach the stylus, and this causes the base to be not perfectly flat.  It's not a complete disaster, but not entirely stable as a result.Also, I had a similar case from Ctech before that also had the 360 degree rotating swivel stand, but without the stylus holder.  I got really good use out of that case, and the only issue I had was that after many months of use, the fit of the case was not as secure as it used to be, and the iPad would come loose once in a while at the corners.  It wasn't so bad that the iPad would fall off or anything, but it certainly lost a little of the initial tight fit.  I suspect that this case would have a similar problem months from now.Overall, this case is a solid value, especially if you compare against some of the &#34;brand names&#34; that look almost the same.

$REVIEW.: Great news


If you wish to keep your cats out of an entire room, this will do the trick
 I learned this after spending $180.00 on ScatMats.Cats are smart critters and learn quickly


After getting zapped, instead of jumping up on the counters at night, they'd just loiter around on the kitchen floor playing tag and daring each other to see who might be dumb enough to take a leap.What I really wanted was for them to stay out of the kitchen altogether

I tried placing the ScatMats on the floor but they'd jump over them.I read countless reviews on electric-eye devices that spray


None were without problems and the refills are expensive.Mount the DRIVEWAY PATROL alarm facing into the room about light switch high at the room entrance so you can easily turn the switch off before entering the room
Set the electric eye sensor on the floor next to a wall a few feet inside the room.At first, the cats will casually enter the room and walk past the alarm and curiously inspect the weird new thing on the floor

That's when the training session begins
Unless there's another entrance, they have to run toward the screaming monster to escape

The alarm only lasts 3 seconds


That's ample time for them to be all the way in the back of the house with enough momentum to go into orbit.We haven't had a cat in the kitchen at night in over 4 weeks

They all mull around at the entrance every morning waiting for me to enter before they'll go near the kitchen.I store the sensor in a dark cabinet during the day to save the battery power.The ScatMats are in storage until the next overnight company arrives.

$review_text.: The USB 3 connector is part of the circuit board - there is no standard SATA connector
So if you bought this device thinking to pull the drive and use it internally elsewhere, you will be disappointed

Of course, that also means that the drive cannot be connected to a SATA-USB write-blocker for data recovery, etc.


$review_summary.: No SATA connector inside casing

$REVIEW.: I wish this loupe cost about half as much, but it definitely helps when you shoot on location as often as I do. If you have any imperfections on your screen the loupe will definitely reveal them, haha, I didn't know my screen had any scratches before. In that respect I would almost say the loupe  magnifies too much, but honestly, now that I have it, I couldn't imagine shooting on location without it.
$SUMMARY.: Overpriced, but Effective

$review_text.: This card is part of a rebuild of my PC which included a new motherboard and processor and RAM.  The computer is running much faster now, and is also much quiter than it used to be, and the CPU and graphics card are all running much cooler than my old setup.  I'm no gamer, so I'm not overclocking or pushing this card to its limits, but for the price, it is more than adequate to my needs.
$SUMMARY.: Fast & cool & quiet

Photoshop Launches fresh in ~3 seconds, once it's cached, it takes about ~1 second to re-launch. InDesign, the all-time memory/processor disc pig, takes ~7 seconds to launch fresh, ~3 seconds once cached from re-launch (Compared to almost 40 seconds from the previous 7200RPM HDD).

$review_text.: I've had one of these before from another company..that one was way more expensive, was made of really hard plastic and had sharp edges...I ended up tossing it in the trash.  This it is similar (clear plastic), but is made of a much softer material and you can easily bend it with your hands..it fits tightly around the iPad 2 and you have to bend the lips a bit on one side to get it on...this can be done by anyone though it may take some doing for some..but the material is pliable. Also, it doesn't have any sharp edges that want to cut into your hands while holding it.My only gripe is that it is kinda of heavy and thick. My iPad with the leather smart cover and this on the back comes in at 1 lb 13 oz, or about 1.8 lbs.  That's kinda heavy to me (I am a big strong guy but I like my toys to be light and sleek!). This will definitely protect your iPad from scratches on the back, which is what I wanted until I can get something else (for $4 it was worth it). I would like it to be a bit thinner and lighter. Personally, I would not (and do not) expect this to provide protection in a drop that hits a hard surface...if you want protection for that get Apple Care or a Square Trade warranty.  This will protect the back from scratches so you can sell it (for more $$) to get an iPad 3!!!  $4 well spent, IMO.
$SUMMARY.: Great price for scratch protection for back of iPad 2!

$REVIEW.: Audio choices are obviously very personal, so I hesitate to recommend anything too strongly here

Tastes and tolerances differ so greatly, and wireless audio products really seem to push those differences
Maybe some of my needs and wants will match yours, maybe not, but please consider my thoughts here in light of the many personal qualifiers that I add
Those qualifiers may or may not relate well to your own situation
By the way, my apologies in advance for such a long review, but I really appreciate details when researching audio gear


I thought you might, too.BACKGROUNDI'm about as picky as they come when sound is the issue

I have a small home recording studio, with 30 years of experience as a semi-pro musician (jazz, rock, classical, country)


That said, I approach every musical equipment purchase with thorough research and comparison

Since I already have good wired phones (Senn 280s, Audio Technica M50s, and others) in my studio, I wanted some wireless cans mostly for moving around the house and yard while listening to music from my home stereo system, kind of a self-indulgent luxury


I've read enough to know that any wireless models using a radio signal (the best type of signal if you'll be in a different room than the transmitter) will produce some hiss and pop on occasion


I accepted this fact before buying

Still, I decided I would not accept something else: poor sound quality, in a musical sense
Two of the sub-$200 phones with rather consistently high reviews (in magazines and online) were the Senn 130 and 140 models

So I ordered both models to compare them in the privacy of my home

(I paid about $115 for the RS-130 and $135 for the RS-140; be patient because the prices here fluctuate often.)TEST EQUIPMENTA 100-watt/channel JVC receiver and JVC CD player--both typical (low-end) home stereo components
To suit my personal tastes for EQ, I boosted some at 16 kHz (to add air to the highs) and at 60 Hz (to add depth to the lows).FOR MUSIC NOT TVI've used these cans mostly for listening to music, which usually masks any low-grade background noise

TV use, with its emphasis on dialogue, would be demanding in other ways, so I'd defer to other reviewers for feedback concerning that application.POINT OF REFERENCEThe entry-level price for a decent set of wired (corded) cans is roughly $100


The price of these wireless Senns, especially the 130s, isn't much more.LIKESMusically, both models sound as good as I'd hoped except for their shy response at the extremes (see Test Equipment above)


Still, when I've been wearing them while working outside, I sometimes have to stop what I'm doing, raise the volume, and just listen for a while

They sound that good
I wouldn't use them in my studio, but considering the low price and mobility, I'm very satisfied

As I'd read, the open-back 130s sound (and look) a bit like Senn's popular 580 audiophile (wired) model--open, smooth, warm, and most of all, pretty well balanced
The closed-back 140s have a similar sound, maybe a bit boxier, overall, as is typical of closed cans
I think that some folks (such as heavy rock n' rollers, rappers, computer gamers, the hearing impaired, and even office workers) might prefer the 140s for their enhanced isolation, but I found the 130s, which offer the spacious open-back sound that made Senn famous, to provide the flatest, truest sound, overall

After a lot of back and forth listening to verify my impressions, I kept the 130s


 The 140s would be a perfectly acceptable alternative, though


The differences are minor.Both models are cushy comfortable, and the features and controls are top-notch
I've never liked surround-sound simulations and the like, so I can't comment on that feature (130s)


But I find everything very simple to use, and all works fine


Like easy? Hang these Senns up and they turn off and charge automatically
Press a button and they tune their reception and then memorize it, also automatically
The reception's very good, too, after I improved it significantly by moving the transmitter unit to a slightly higher shelf and trying the different freq-channel options
Remember this if you buy
Also remember to boost the source volume plenty so that the phones receive a strong signal

(By the way, I've read that you may experience greater interference noise if you live in a congested area, which I don't.)DISLIKESNo review would be complete without some criticism and warning, so here's mine


Above all, choosing musical equipment involves personal tastes, which vary greatly, so try to listen before buying
Trust your own ears
If you do buy either Senn wireless model, you should expect some hiss and pop and hum at times, usually just when you move around, but almost certainly if you head outside or into another room far from the base unit
(The stated spec of "up to 150 meters" seems laughable.) You may even notice the sound strengthen and weaken on occasion


In this price range, at least, I think you'll need to accept such reception problems or else stay with wired cans
Period
Wireless freedom is never perfect, is it? Beyond that, I wish these cans were as snug-fitting as my Senn 280s, which grip my head tightly


These wireless phones are like light pillows, very comfortable since they sit 'around' the ears (not 'on' the ears), but I'd bet that some folks with smaller heads could find them to be a bit loose when walking around
And finally, another obvious point--bad or good, depending on your situation--is that the 130s (which I prefer in terms of smoother, truer sound) are open-air cans, meaning that you'll hear your family if in the same room
That's good for staying in contact but bad if you want to get away from outside noise


The closed 140s are certainly better for blocking out a barking dog or not disturbing a nearby loved one.COMMENT ABOUT INTERFERENCE PROBLEMSIf you're not already totally sick of me, you can check out my reaction to the interference problems that some users report here
(Click on 'Comments' below.)OVERALLAll in all, both models of these phones admirably meet my picky expectations although being realistic about the limits of low-cost wireless sound was a necessary starting point

Nah, these wireless phones aren't perfect, and they're certainly no match for good wired cans, but I think they offer impressive overall performance for $100 plus change


An enthusiastic '4 and a 1/2 stars' and a lot of brag from me


Well done, Senn
Happy listening, all.P.S

TO ANYONE WITH HEARING LOSSIf you have reduced hearing, particularly in one ear, you should probably choose the RS-140 model


The addition of the closed back (for isolation), L-R balance control, and compression switch (to equalize the overall volume) could be helpful.NEED MORE RESEARCH?Head over to "Consumer Search" online for a master summary of pro and consumer reviews of wireless headphones, including these


(The Senns do very well.)UPDATE (2011)A quick update, more than six years of frequent use later: no surprises, no regrets


I stand by my review fully
I did find one time that the headphones didn't work, but a quick jiggle of the audio input in the base unit brought them back to life
True, as some folks have noted, there is indeed annoying interference at times but usually just when moving around in another room or outdoors


That's only a minor limitation for me but clearly a deal-breaker for some people (although some of them, I suspect, haven't boosted the source volume enough)
But the surprisingly good music quality and thoughtful design at this low price point is the real story here for me and my primarily musical needs


If you eventually decide to give the Senns a try, just be sure that you can easily return them if they don't fit your own needs and limits

I typically return about half of the audio equipment I buy, even after thorough research, and have learned the value of a simple return policy

Good luck to you.DISCLAIMER (2011)I notice that the price has nearly doubled since when I wrote my review, and that would change things for me
If I had this much to spend on wireless cans, I'd likely opt for Senn's new RS-180 model instead.

$SUMMARY.: At last..

wireless sound worth bragging about

$REVIEW.: Pros:- Plenty sturdy for point and shoot and small video cameras

 I haven't tested with a big SLR, but it seems like it would do fine and has a hook for a weight as well.- Easy to use quick release plate- Tall enough for most purposes

 I'm about 6'2" and have no problem using it.- Good features and easy to use - level, pan and tilt lock, portrait mode, crank elevator with lock (not sure what this is actually called).- Very light- Folds up to a pretty compact size- Good price- Carrying handle (not really needed IMO)- Comes with a bagCons:- The locks for sliding the legs in and out are a bit sticky

 It does make it seem the thing isn't going to collapse, but they're not very easy to open.- One of the clamps broke and would not fasten
 Fortunately it was just the plastic piece that provides resistance to the clamp, so I stuffed some pipe cleaner into the space and now it works again


 This doesn't inspire a lot of confidence though.- I could not find a Dolica spare quick release plate from anyone
 I finally found a compatible one from a different manufacturer, it's a Sunpak SP620-731
 That plate is bigger and doesn't seem quite as high quality as the Dolica one, but it fits and it's inexpensive.- I emailed Dolica about a spare QR plate and they never responded, so I can't really say anything good about their customer service, at least via email.I recommend this tripod unless you will need extra quick release plates
 In that case I would look for something that you know you can get original equipment extras for.

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these to watch Netflix on my older (non-HD) television. As a 'power user', i find it pretty limited; however, it is well worth the $50 price i paid.GOOD:- The hardware is small, aesthetically attractive, and unobtrusive.- Set-up of both the hardware and the software is very easy, requiring only a few minutes of work.- The remote control is adorable and intuitive, and has a satisfying 'punchiness'.- The software is much better designed than most devices of this price class, and is nearly on par with the Apple TV.- The hardware appears to work equally well with HD and non-HD televisions.BAD:- The player supports 802.11n Wi-Fi, but ONLY on 2.4 GHz -- it will not connect to 5 GHz networks.- The software occasionally locks up whilst navigating the menus, forcing me to get up and physically yank the power from the box. (There is no power button.)- The software doesn't have a great deal of options or features. The box itself (without any 'channels') is essentially useless -- it won't do LAN streaming of any kind, for instance.- The Netflix app is uglier and more limited than the one on the Xbox 360, or even (in some ways) the browser-based player. The major limitation for me is that auto-playing TV episodes is not supported. Additionally, there is no overlay information when you're watching something -- if you pause the video, it just pauses the video, that's it. Unlike the console- and Web-based players, it won't give you the title or synopsis or anything, and it only briefly displays the elapsed time.Almost all of my time with it is spent watching Netflix, so i can't comment on the other channels.

I liked that email and I intend to follow its advice.OK.....I have a HP HPE-410F system, AMD PhenomII X6 1045T @2.70GHz, N-Alvorix-RS880-uATX (Alvorix), 8.00 GB, ATI Radeon HT5570, Seagate Barracuda 1TB SATA2 32MB cache 7200RPM (primary HDD)I installed a new Gigaware 2-Port USB 3.0 PCI Express Card, which was absurdly cheap prior to the Plugable dock purchase, since USB 2.0 is all the computer had OEM.I ordered a new Hitachi Ultrastar 2TB 64MB 7200RPM 3.5&#34; (Enterprise) SATA 6.0Gb/s Hard Drive.First reading the instructions with the Plugable dock, I then inserted HDD into the dock, connected the power supply with the dock switch off, then the USB 3.0 cable between the dock and the recently installed USB 3.0 input.(PRIOR to the first use of the Plugable device, the new Gigaware 2-Port USB 3.0 PCI Express Card worked fine with other USB devices including a Seagate USB 3.0 portable 1TB HDD...but I don't know what actual DATA FLOW RATE was obtained since presently I haven't the means to measure.)Plugable dock switch TURNED ON......LED activates, HDD spins......computer doesn't recognize the new device. (HDD was sold stated formatting was required) It doesn't appear anywhere on the system.Plugable dock switch off, then USB cable replaced into computer's USB 2.0 input then POWER ON.....computer recognizes the device and begins searching and installing drivers for it.The Plugable website FAQ page addresses the possibility of issues between USB 3.0 products of different manufacturers......&#62;&#62;&#62;We recommend connecting the USB3-SATA-UASP1 Docking Station directly to a USB 3.0 port on your computer for best results. The ASMedia chipset is a solid performer, and does usually work with hubs but because of issues that can occur between different manufacturers USB 3.0 systems and USB 3.0 hubs we recommend connecting the SATA-UASP1 directly if you experience any problems.&#60;&#60;&#60; .....so I allow that this may be my issue particularly since my USB 3.0 Express Card costs a mere $3 bucks plus $3.99 shipping off Amazon! Meanwhile....As the Plugable rig is found by the system through a USB 2.0 port, I connect an iPod to a USB 3.0  port to see if that's normal and it is, fully recognized as always before.From the USB 2.0 port the HDD in the Plugable dock shows in Device Manager and/or Disk Management as &#34;Disk 1&#34;...Unknown/Not Initialized/with 1863.02 GB Unallocated. The &#34;Initialize Disk&#34; window is open with &#34;Disk 1&#34; and &#34;MBR&#34; preselected.

ASM1053E relates to the Plugable device alone.).....then....POWER OFF the Plugable dock, return the USB 3.0 cable to the USB 3.0 port and POWER ON...NOW the computer recognizes the Plugable device from the USB 3.0 port!The Plugable device is recognized in Device Manager and/or Disk Management just as before, needing &#34;Initializing.&#34; So THEN I proceeded.&#34;Disk 1_MBR_New Simple Volume Wizard_Max Disk Space @1907727MB_Drive letter F_Format Partition NTFS, Default, Hitachi 2TB_Wizard Summary&#34;.........FULL FORMAT in this manner took FIVE hours and THIRTEEN minutes to complete.The Hitachi HDD reported in properties as 1.81 TB free space, 147 MB used space and shown in Windows Explorer as, &#34;This Folder is Empty.&#34;Numerous times I powered up the Plugable/Hitachi device and all is fine.As new computer hardware, I give the Plugable Docking Station FIVE STARS.

$review_text.: I have a 40&#34; Sony/Google (1st gen. android/smart TV) on the generic wall mount Cheetah knock-off.  The sound bar is a Sony ht-ct260h.  The sound bar dangles below the TV.  The only way I could get it to work was to attach the bracket to the large rectangular mounting plate that the TV attaches to, then attach to the sound bar.  It works fine.  However, I suspect it could have been done just as easily with angle-iron from the hardware store.  I didn't price angle-iron so I don't know which would have been the most cost effective.  If the silver color of the angle-iron would have been an issue, I would have slid the angle-iron into some bicycle inner-tube scraps.  This would have made it blend and given a little cushioning.

$review_text.: I purchased my ASUS RT-N56U after my faithful Belkin N1 router started to need almost daily resets to keep it working
 After doing a fair bit of replacement research, I settled on the ASUS due to all the positive reviews, dual band, and ability to use for network storage access


 I've had the unit for over a month now, and here's my take on it:* User Interface - I know - lots of folks complaining it is kludgy and slow
 To be honest - I found it far less annoying than others I've used, and while in some cases it is slow in applying changes (sit back for 90-120 seconds or so) if you only are going into your router for initial setup and a couple of tweaks once in awhile - it's perfectly acceptable* Flexibility - Love having the dual band & QOS tools (my Xbox users have never been happier not having to share bandwidth), and was able to easily adminster changes to support opening various ports for Minecraft servers and the like.* Power/throughput- Definitely get full coverage of my house under 2.4 Ghz (5 bars in basement) - with 5 Ghz fading out to two bars in the basement (2 floors away) but still quite usable


 We are a heavy bandwidth household due to many connected game systems, tablets etc - and all are very happy with the new router's performance.* Looks - Got to admit it's the first time my kids and wife have actually complimented a router (my kids call it "cool")* Extra features - The ability to easily make my portable backup devices available as network(and internet) storage devices is a plus

 While my oldie-moldie HP printer isn't compatible with the network printer feature - I definitely will be looking for an RT-N56U compatible one when I buy its replacement.



$SUMMARY.: Fast, flexible, and good coverage - what's not to like?

$review_text.: I have this unit hooked up to my desktop and the NAS.  I have it linked to my NAS via USB.  It comes in very handy if you don't want to loose any data.  It can give you an average time that the unit can stay on battery power until it shuts down, and has several different monitory screens.  In addition, it can tell my NAS (through the NAS configuration and a USB connection) that it is on battery power, due to a power failure, and will alert it when it is back on real power.  My NAS has been saved from power failures several times since i bought this unit, and with the visual confirmation on how much time it can last on battery power due to it's load, I can set my NAS up to shut down (to be safe I told my NAS to shut down in half the amount of time (7min)  that the back up battery is presenting (14 min) to allow the NAS plenty of time to shut down in case I loose power all night.

$REVIEW.: The two greatest features are the integrated cables and the cool lighting setup on this drive. The cables make storage in the case with my other items a breeze, this is my favorite feature. Since I have two USB ports on one side and a third on the other, even if I needed the Booster cable hooked up, it would be simple.Other reviewers said it was noisy, but I think it is very quiet so far. Also, I have not had to use the booster cable when using it with my Acer D255E and the standard 3 cell battery. It has an optional DC power port for external power, which is nice if I were to want to run it or supplement it with a separate battery source to preserve the battery on my little notebook.As others have said, the shiny black top looks nice when new, but shows fingerprints and I'm sure after some use may show some scratches. I will just find a cool sticker(s) to put on the top if / when this happens, so it's really not a con, I'm just mentioning it.

$REVIEW.: I could try writing a stunning review with many detailed and exacting comments on the great and not so great technical aspects of this unit...but I'm not. Read the other reviews! There are some amazing folks here with lots to say that will equip you with much needed information. I on the other hand have one thing to say...the unit performs great. I use it for two specific things. 1 - I have a Bluetooth receiver plugged into the "Portable" input and I stream Google music from our smartphones. I realize that I'm not really getting all the frequencies a high end unit playing LPs would reproduce but I have to get all those technical topics out of my mind because I can't afford the high end gear!2 - It sounds great! Streaming music over the internet with a smartphone connected to a router connected to a Bluetooth receiver and the sound is not bad passing all these paths!It's amazing what we have done with technology. For the money, you "can't beat it with a stick" as my wife likes to say.I haven't had any trouble streaming music in the above fashion or listening to NPR.I also love that the unit shuts itself down when it doesn't detect a signal after a number of minutes.

There are ample outside pockets as well as a padded internal compartment that is great for carrying your electronics and the like out on the trail.  It has been comfortable to wear, although a bit heavier than true hiking packs for serious trail use.What makes this product especially great is the fact it is made from reclaimed hemp, organic cotton and recycled water bottles.  When you hold it you might think it feels like a nice heavy canvas - turns out the pack is made from recycled materials.  Pretty awesome!

$review_text.: Due to a potential shipping delay, I ordered the similarly-purposed plastic version (Icy Dock MB882SP-1S-2B) of this item at the same time
In the end, both arrived the same day so I had an opportunity to compare closely and select which one to use for my SSD installation task.I opted for this metal version, and it does work (after one try when the SSD wasn't recognized by the system, remedied by pulling the caddy back out, fussing over the adapter without really changing anything, then re-installing)
However, it did leave me with some concerns, as follows.- the holes for the four mounting screws were correctly positioned but required more than the expected amount of force to drive in the screws
It was as if the holes were not pre-threaded

Tightening these screws into a real 3.5 drive feels like a precision operation
Tightening them into this adapter made me hope I wasn't cross-threading the screws.- there is a clever mechanical linkage that automatically slides your SSD into the connector fitting as you close the hinged lid of the adapter
Unfortunately, since the lid hides the evidence, you don't really know how well the SSD connector has been mated into the adapter's connector


All the way? Or perhaps a millimeter shy? We are depending on the precision of the sheet metal parts for a tight (but non-damaging) fit.- there are air vents, but not particularly extensive


My SSD temperature is running about 85F (in 70F ambient) - this may be normal (I don't know what a "normal" SSD temp is).In comparison, Icy Dock's plastic version of this article doesn't look so bad
The plastic injection molding is probably more precise than the other's sheet metal work


It has nice looking brass threaded inserts for the mounting screws
You snap your SSD in yourself, then slide on the plastic lid, so the critical installation step is in sight
Next time, I would probably go with the plastic version.

$review_text.: I bought this flash originally to use with my Olympus C-700 UZ camera because I had found that when using the Olympus wide-angle converter lens on my camera, the diameter of the wide-angle lens was so large that it blocked off the beam from the cameras built in flash. Because of this every shot I took had a big black half circle shadow across the bottom of the frame.To eliminate this problem and mount the light source as far away as possible from the lens I decided to buy the Olympus FL-20 Flash unit, the FL-BK01 right angle flash bracket, and the FLCB01 TTL sync cable to electrically connect the flash to the camera.Once I started using this set up I immediately started getting the results I needed right away. The FL-20 flash had greater output and greater coverage than the built in flash. Exposures were perfect because the flash worked with the cameras TTL metering system via the FLCB01 cable. You can even stand a little further back from the subject when shooting because the higher light output of this unit gives you greater reach. Red eye was also eliminated because by using the flash grip I offset the axis of the flash beam away from the axis of the camera lens. The FL-20 even comes with a little snap on diffuser lens you can use to widen the area of coverage of the flash beam. It runs on 2 AA batteries. I used the flash with the rechargeable type AA batteries.I was very happy I bought this unit and on my indoor picture taking sessions it became the standard fare for me as far as equipment was concerned. Down the road I did up grade to the more powerful FL-50 flash, but for most over your average family and friends type picture taking sessions the Olympus FL-20 is all the flash you will ever need.

 Which doesn't really feel very nice.So, I'll use this case, until I find one without the felt on the other side.Too bad - it's otherwise perfect (and no, I didn't smell anything, unlike many other users).

$review_text.: First, I should mention that the Amazon description says "7-10 inch", but if you have a 7 inch tablet, then it will float around the case - it is really too big for a 7 inch device (unless perhaps you keep it in one of those cases that folds into a stand, and put that whole thing in this case).With that out of the way, I can say that this is a well designed and manufactured case.  The two zippers are both unusually high quality, with rubber grips that can double as small handles for the case.  The accessories pouch is entirely external to the main case, with slightly thicker padding between the accessories and the tablet, so to insure that it is not damaged by its own power supply.  There is also a special holder for a USB flash drive.Would have been five stars if it had a handle attached - which is also warranted by the price, which is somewhat above the lowest prices of tablet neoprene cases.Recommended - if you like the dark teal color  :)  (which is slightly darker than the Amazon picture)

$review_text.: This mouse provoked this review out of me. I normally would never go about bashing any item. This mouse consumes batteries like anything [AND 2 BATTERIES ALSO]. Other wireless mice I have used run at least 1 year without the need to change batteries. And again, since it is $12, the first thing you receive in this mouse is near dead batteries. For a mouse which requires 2 AAA batteries to work leads me to think what quality components were used.My second quirk was how it dies every 5 minutes and then has to be restarted. Just scrolling the mouse to make it work again doesn't happen. I e-mailed the company for a warranty return which they might do but it might cost me as much just to send it and get it back. So, I am not even going to bother replacing it.In conclusion - Take a risk with your money. It's either a win (you might be surprised) or a total waste (you will be disappointed).My opinion - Buy a quality product and save your time and money.

I used it for a conference call using the new release of Skype, which supports Bluetooth, and the audio quality was excellent. The speaker quality for playing music is surprisingly good, and I've even tried it with my MacBook Pro to watch the Apple press conference for the release of the 4s. It is much better quality than the built-in speakers, and with additional volume.I was able to update the Jambox firmware on the Jawbone website very easily as well as customize the name of the speaker. (It's under "Advanced") The only mistake I encountered was I didn't realize the unit had to be in the off position in order to be recognized. Once I did that, everything else was automatic.So do I recommend this speaker? The answer is YES, but be sure you understand how to pair a Bluetooth device or you may be frustrated. This isn't a fault of the Jambox, it's just the way Bluetooth works. If you're a technophobe, make sure you have some help when your order arrives. Once it's paired, relax and listen to the great sound of the Jambox, with NO wires!!

Finding a "wired" mouse in stores these days is darn near impossible!Yes, this would be good for a laptop that isn't used for any real length of time. It's small enough for a Mouse to use! Okay...maybe not THAT small but I know a golden retriever could easily use it! Now I have small hands. I buy children's winter gloves because they fit my hands so well. This mouse was way too small for me! The wheel was stiff and difficult to move while trying to keep 2 fingers on the mouse to hold it steady. The retractor seemed cheaply made and I can't imagine it would work for very long but the cord itself is a nice length. I prefer "wired" equipment because I hate the thought of buying tons of batteries. And then there's the problem with where to dump the used batteries. How would you like a "battery landfill" under that new million dollar home you bought and growing your own "organic" vegetables??? This is a laptop mouse and should never be thought of as one that could be used on a daily basis. It would destroy your hand. I tried it because reviewers here said to try a laptop mouse if you have small hands. I tried, it didn't work. My search continues....

 I bought it based on the positive reviews here
 I complete agree: it is a very good product.I have two PCs: One uses Window XP with USB 2; and the other uses Window 2000 with USB 1


This reader works flawlessly on both PCs

 Of course, I get lightning speed on the PC with USB 2 connection


 I have tested with compact flash and SD cards, no problem at all.I have used four different readers before


 All of them required to close folder opened by reader before ejecting device from PC
Otherwise, window would display "device is busy" message, and could not eject readers

No problem for this one

I can eject it without close folder opened by it, very convenience to use.One bonus for me is its packaging wrapper


 This small, well looked and reusable packaging wrapper can be used as a storage case for this device and its USB cable.Only one small issue


 I did not see LED light while transferring data


Then, I found that I could see LED light from top down, not from the side


 It will be nice to make LED closer to the top surface, so users could see LED light from the side


I don't think I would reduce rating on this small issue.

 I bought them to back-up my laptop...and I bought the extra one for other things I would like to save...just in case

 You never know when your laptop may crash


 I have learned the hard way...so people back up your hard drive!The seller is very good...and I highly recommend them.

$review_text.: Not much to say besides this mouse has no functional issues that are often apparent in cheap mice. For the price, you get a solid, silent, smooth mouse. My only gripe is the cord is a bit shorter than my previous mice, which makes this better for laptops or PCs that aren't far from the desk/monitor/keyboard.
$review_summary.: As a basic mouse, it does everything well

$review_text.: I tested this as soon as I got home since I received the package today.  AWESOME turnaround time with shipping by Amazon by the way!  I must say, by the comments left about the sound quality I thought I was in for your basic audio.  I'm a huge home theater/car sound enthusiast so I am very picky about my sound.  Once I dialed in to the station I had I wanted to use and pressed select, the radio fuzz when dead quiet and I pressed play on my iPod.  Solid, SOLID sound.  Maybe it's the nice system already in the car, but I didn't find myself having to turn up the volume to get great sound cause it already sounded very nice.  Tested songs with heavy bass and songs with a lot of acoustics.  Factory sound system too!  My ears were pleased and it passed.  Better than radio by far, but not quite CD...if that makes sense.  I would recommend to anyone!!!  Pleased customer!

$review_text.: I brought this kit since i was going to record full HD videos(35 Mb/s) at 60fps on my Sony PJ710 and i needed a large battery and a spare to record continuously so that i don't have to hold back on charging the batteries while i miss precious moments. the kit arrived promptly(Love Amazon's prime and 1 day shipping) and i was able to charge both the batteries before i went out on a trip. Over the std. battery that comes with my camcorder(Sony NP-FV50) which gives around 1 hr of recording, this battery(NP-FV70) gives me close to 3 hrs of recording and with two batteries i have almost 6 hrs of recording time. The batteries seem to hold their charge well and recharge in a couple of hrs and the included charger with the Europe adapter works and is a boon for me. ?I haven't used the car charger, but it should come in handy especially if you are doing road trips. Overall, great kit and products.

$review_text.: I spent more time fretting over which antenna to buy than I should have

The fact is that digital TV (DTV) and HDTV are simply a UHF broadcast

ANY UHF antenna should provide some signal
The reason for purchasing a high gain antenna (such as the DB4) is that with digital, a good signal means a perfect picture
A poor signal means no picture

There is no fuzzy middle ground.Here is a summary of the tips I gathered while researching antennas

The more closely you follow these steps, the better your results will be.1) Go to [...] and click on "Choose and antenna" to determine the distance and direction of the channels you want to get.2) If possible, mount the antenna on the roof

Attic mounting will result in 40 - 50% signal loss.3) Orient the antenna as accurately as possible


If you have one, use a compass and the heading you got from antennaweb.org
UHF is directional, so the more accurate the direction, the better the signal.4) Use RG-6 (Satellite) coax cable and keep the run as short as practical


The same length of RG-59 (CATV) cable will result in much more signal loss.That said, here's what was working against me


1) I am a fairly distant 40 miles from all of the transmitters
2) I didn't feel like messing around on the roof, so I mounted the antenna in the attic


If interested, my antenna mount consisted of a scrap piece of conduit and a spare conduit strap
Total cost should be less than $4

On the plus side, I did aim the antenna as best as possible and I had a fairly short length (32 feet) of RG-6.My unscientific analysis was to look at the signal strength meter function of the digital TV converter box
It is simply a scale from 0 to 100
To my surprise, the signal strength was in the 90's for all of the channels
That is better than expected.Basically, this is a very good antenna
Just remember that the better the installation job, the better your reception will be.

$SUMMARY.: A Great Antenna for DTV and Over the Air HDTV

$review_text.: I chose this screen protector because it had good reviews and included the stylus. I even opted to pay for shipping over choosing a Prime eligible product. Delivery was not quick.  The application was very difficult.  I did watch the YouTube demo as other reviewers mentioned but, alas, did not really get the value of doing the application in the bathroom after a shower. [I am NOT making this up, check YouTube].  In any event, the sticky side was a dust magnet and trapped many particles.  After reviewing the YouTube hints again, I found a technique to remove dust specks and just when I was done and attempted to pull off only the protective top on the screen protector, the whole thing came off and I could install it again, as the screen protector would no longer adhere to the screen.  Aaargh.  I liked the little stylus and that it plugged into the microphone jack.  But it came apart after extending it twice.  I did glue it back together, but found that the surface of the stylus simply did not work with either my Kindle Fire or my Ipod Touch. So for me this was a total no-go. Maybe you'll have a better experience.  I have since ordered another item - which includes 2 screen protectors and I will try the 'after the shower' installation tip.

$review_text.: Purchased this from Photo Adapter LLC.  It came quickly and was exactly as promised.Read instructions (twice) and carefully cleaned my view screen. Then carefully installed the protector.  My installation was good (not perfect but really good) and I was happy with the alignment.  The glass was clear and the images looked very good when viewed through the protector.  The protector is somewhat thick and does extend out from the camera ever so slightly.  However the amount is slight and not objectionable.Fast forward about three weeks.  Grabbed the camera from the bag to recharge batteries and get ready to shooting a wedding tomorrow.  I immediately noticed that the glass had slipped over about 1/4 to 1/3 of an inch.  Totally unacceptable.  Pulled up a review and saw that it could be removed with a credit card.  Using a credit care I carefully removed it without a problem.  The glass has a slight glue smear on it that I am still trying to remove (going to try a razor blade as my glass cleaner did not get it).Current status is the glass is sitting on a table and the sticky ring is still around my camera viewer.Overall I really like this product.  I am disappointed that it slipped over to the side, especially as I was careful to install it and then let it sit undisturbed for a full day).Yes I would buy this product again (and may have too).  I really like the protection it affords the viewfinder.  It was was very clear and the product was exactly what I ordered.  I will also use the same vendor as the product was rapidly shipped and came securely packaged.

$REVIEW.: In brief, the Brenthaven ProStyle SlimPack is definitely a minimalist take on a notebook backpack. I primarly wanted something to carry my MacBook Pro and miscellanous accessories. If you're the type of person who carries a lunch to work, look elsewhere. Here's an idea of what I carry:- 15" MacBook Pro- Charger w/ extension cable- iPad 2- A couple pens and pencils- Earphones and sync cable- NotebookAnything beyond that requires a larger bag. Occasionally I can get away with a slim tupperware sitting on top of the internal opening, but then the flap barely reaches the button clasp.Regardless, understand your needs for a pack like this. If you move to and from work with a light gear footprint, this bag works great.

I don't know how they work as an exercise headphone as i use a different brand and these were purchase to use in non-athletic venues.

$review_text.: f you have any problems with the machine you are in real trouble.I have had a bad experience with Asus.I wish I had read this on the BBB about Asus before purchasing any product.Direct From the BBB&#34;We have identified a pattern of complaints concerning service issues. Complaints processed by BBB claim that 1) products sent to the company for repairs are still not working properly when returned to the consumer.On June 29, 2012 ASUS responded to the issue by stating: We continuously enhance our repair service levels across the board, but in specific response to the repair quality concerns addressed in this letter we have strengthened core processes which may have been at the root of the matter and ASUS valued customers, with non-component systems products will benefit from the enhanced RMA process and instructions.BBB again reviewed this company's file for complaints. As of January 14, 2013 the issue of products sent to the company for repairs still not working properly when returned to the consumer still remains.&#34;

$review_text.: I've only had my ViewSonic PJD5123 one day, which is a little premature for reviewing, but with only one review posted, I thought another would be helpful.  I actually made my purchase on that review's recommendation, since I could find no others.First, let me say that my purchase was largely price-driven.  I figured I'd have to buy a used projector, but the low price Amazon charged was the hook that caused me to bite on this brand-new one.  My second criterion was that it had to work with a Mac; it does!  I did have to purchase an extra cable for my Macbook Pro unibody ($29.99 from Apple).  I could have gotten a third party cable for much less (and may still do that for a backup), but the reviews on them were not as favorable as those on the Apple one.So I took the plunge, even paying an extra $4 (Amazon Prime) to have it delivered in two days.  It arrived on time and I found everything in the box as advertised.  The written documentation is worthless, but their CD has much good information.  You can also go to the ViewSonic website and download their PDF manual to read before your purchase arrives (highly recommended).I installed the software on my Macbook Pro, connected the ViewSonic PJD5123 and fired it up.  My computer (running OS X 10.6.7) recognized the projector and the computer screen's image shone on the white wall across the room, but it was very blurry.  My heart sank.  Thinking I'd bought a pig in a poke, I began lamenting the irritation of having to ship it back.  Then, I began to turn the adjustments this way and that, and the picture on the wall became as clear as the one on the laptop screen.  Was I ever relieved!Then I wondered, will it work in an environment with a lot of daylight?  Because I teach college courses and give seminars in rooms with many windows, I needed a projector with enough brightness to provide a clear text and picture in broad daylight.  Now please do not misunderstand. The picture and text are better at night, but they are just fine in the daylight.Someone may wonder how it works for movie watching.  I've been watching movies on my 17" computer screen, so when I focused the ViewSonic with a movie projecting from it on the wall, I held my breath hoping that it would provide at least an acceptable picture.  Wow, was I every pleased!  I now have a huge screen on the wall that looks as good as the one on my computer.  This is a bonus I'd not planned on.Another concern for me is the voltage.  I travel internationally and was delighted to find that this little projector works with 110-240v/50-60hz.  With a plug adapter I'll be in business in the USA and foreign countries.I almost forgot to mention that while there is no carrying case, a remote (with batteries!) is included.  I've barely used the remote, but the features look sufficient for my use.  As for the bag, what do you want for a rock bottom price?  I'll likely go to the local thrift store and find a suitable case for less than three bucks!Do I have any concerns or disappointments?  So far I'm not disappointed at all.  This projector does all the basic stuff I need and provides a very nice picture.  My only concern is that when I shut it down I do not hear the fan running to cool it down before final shut down as the instructions indicate.  I will call or email the company to see if its shut down feature is defective.  My guess is that it is just fine.  Other than that, it seems to work A-OK!Please note that this is not a heavy-duty, latest and greatest feature-filled projector.  For such a product you'll likely pay three or four times what this little fellow costs.  But it does what I need and even has an eye to the future with a sticker that boasts "3-D READY."ADDED 6 JULY, 2011Just a quick note on the issue of the fan not running after shutdown to cool the projector:  I emailed ViewSonic on Saturday of the July 4th weekend and they responded promptly the following Tuesday after the holidays.  Here's their email response:"Dear Valued Customer,Thank you for contacting ViewSonic. Our newer projectors have a feature in which the unit will cool off  on its own when needed. This new feature is so that the unit can be used more on the go ,  ViewSonic and a few other brand name companies have added such feature to recently manufactured projectors . If you should have further questions please contact us back. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to provide assistance."Well, I couldn't believe what I'd read, so I called ViewSonic and talked to a technical person.  He assured me that the email was, indeed, correct and that the unit is working just fine.  He said ViewSonic designed this projector so that one could immediately pack it away after using it.  For me, this is a blessing in disguise! It means that I can use the projector until the close of class, and immediately walk out with it.Summer 2012 Update:  Just to let everyone know, I am still using the PJD5123 with satisfaction.  Some have questioned whether it does, indeed, work with 240V as well as 110V.  If you look on the bottom of the unit, it says AC 100-240V 50-60HZ.

$REVIEW.: I was using a cheap tripod I had still (it was $7.99) on my new dSLR. The thing was so light that it wasnt stable. Also, the weight of my Canon 60D and 70-300 lens actually pulled the mount through the quick release on the cheap tripod. Now the 70-300 lens is sitting in Canons factory repair center, luckily the camera was undamaged. Do yourself a favor and don't put a nice camera on a cheap tripod!This tripod is a great upgrade for me. Its very sturdy, and the weight is moderate which is what I wanted. Not to light (you want some weight so it isn't to flimsy and shaky with a heavier camera) but not too heavy that its a burden to take. Tension-adjustable buckles are nice, and the wrench is attached. Full hieght, no more bending over to look through the camera. I like the quick release that has a lock - no accidental releases, yet its still fairly quick, and has metal components.A decent value I think for a nice sturdy tripod. The only thing I wish it had was a decent bubble level, this tripod has no levels. My camera has electronic levels but you loose other on screen functionality if you want to see the level indicator. I'd take off a half star for the level but round back up to 5.

$REVIEW.: We had our doubts, but we do not regret.I am not able to remember all the serious talk about the abilities of this tv, but I know one thing: it looks good.Delivery was fast

When I saw the box size I really thought there was no way I could carry it


As it turns out, the set is pretty light.Installation is a breeze.Place the stand on the back, screw.That's it.Wiring: easy

HDMI from TV to Bluray player


Power cord.In all, it took less than 10 minutes for those two steps, and that includes the wiring of speakers to the amplifier that we bought along this TV.Unless you want to mess with the default set up, there is very little you need to do, you turn on the TV and the TV pretty much takes it from there.We watched regular cable and were are satisfied with the quality of the picture

When you flip channels, there is only a very short waiting time before the switch happens.We purchased the LG player that was featured as an offer
The players responds quickly.We also purchased Tangled, Polar Express and Alice in Wonderland.One concern of ours involved the glasses, since we have 2 kids

We did not want glasses that are too heavy - do keep in mind we do not allow the kids to watch TV that often- nor so expensive that we would be upset if the kids broke them.this time has the best solution: The glasses that are needed are extremely light, perfect for our little people.think about those cheap glasses that you get from the movie theater


Yep, those are the ones, we tried, they work.Amazon frequently offers very interesting promotions (buy this, get 4 pairs)Watching Tangled was amazing, just like a theater moment

It is truly impressive to have so much power coming out of that TV


Amazing.We did watch Alice in Wonderland too


The original movie is fun but the 3D gives such an extra layer of fun.We also tried the fake 3D

It is not bad at all!the TV pretty much tries to add 3D effects
We tried this on a Harry Potter DVD and the effects were really cool.Last but not least

Energy consumption.Our last set was LCD so the consumption was not bad, however this LED TV puts it to shame.We left it on for most a the day at first and you would never know.fantastic.

$REVIEW.: Pros: They're pretty small and aren't too visually simulating (just plain and simple).Setup is relatively easy too, just plug them in, have the main one hooked to your internet source, and the rest just-work (given you're electrical wiring is ideal).Also, this adapter works decently with Steam's In-Home Streaming Beta (for 720p anyway; haven't tried anything higher).Cons: The included software was a bit of a hassle for controlling the adapters.The first issue with it was the version of WinPcap that was included (4.1.2)
It doesn't seem to work properly at all on Windows 8.1, and I wasn't notified that it even tried to install.The second issue involves updating the firmware on the adapters


You have to manually do each adapter
Ideally, being able to push the firmware to all adapters at the same time would of been great.Other Thoughts: When updating the firmware, the adapter should turn off (all lights off) and then turn back on, and do this twice before the process is complete
If all the lights don't turn off at least once during the process, the update didn't happen, regardless of what the software says.A DirecTV HD-DVR I have complained pretty frequently of not being able to establish a connection through the adapter, but this could be due to the wiring of my house.As for how to properly get the Trendnet software working, you first download the latest firmware package (1.0.0-06 at the time of writing), and run the Setup executable

Then you download the latest version of WinPcap (4.3.3 at time of writing), and install it (if it tells you a previous install is present, let it uninstall it)


After that, reboot


The app should now work and detect the adapters properly

Once you do initial setup of the adapters, you shouldn't have to really mess with the software again (unless an updated firmware becomes available, or you need to change security settings).As for electrical wiring, powerline adapters work best in a non-electronically-noisy environment, and when having a direct circuit to other adapters
Depending on your building's wiring, you may be able to get away with using adapters on different circuits, but you shouldn't expect the best results in this case.

$review_text.: I have this wired (though I do use the wireless feature for an extra wifi access point of iOS devices).  Set up was done though an iMac.Besides using it as the Time Machine backup device for the iMac I also use it as a mini file server which is accessible from the PC as well as the iMac.  I named it "TimeCapsule", without the space, in the Airport Utility and accessed it as "\\TimeCapsule" from the PC -- no need for Bonjour or any extra software on the PC.  It just sees it as another "computer" sharing storage.  From the Mac you see the drive at the bottom left of the Finder window under the Shared section. It is a great way to transfer files and keep extra copies of stuff.The Mac backups themselves are not accessible from the PC.  You see them just as a large binary file.  But you can create your own folder structure next to it.It is very silent.  The compromise is that it is a bit slow.  On a gigabit network I get a file transfer speed of 98.5 MBs (79% of a nominal gigabit) from a regular file server running Win7.  The Time Capsule does 29.7 MBs.  But considering the price, the space savings, and that is is pretty much silent, well, I think that today it probably beats most other small file server setups you can come up with at home... plus you get the apple integration and the wireless access point :-)PS: I would not use as external HD for the Mac.  It is too slow for that and you do not get things like the ability to undelete something... which could cost you a lot if you make a mistake.

Regular Canon 4x6 paper DOES NOT WORK! I've tried many other brands, none fit or print.3. Ink cartridge only prints 5 SHEETS!  These cartridges are also hard to find.

$REVIEW.: Although there are already well over 2000 reviews, I wanted to add my own in response to some of the negative comments. I hesitated before purchasing this mount because it looked huge in the picture.  However, we did not want to deal with sticky mounts and wanted to be able to use whatever solution we had in two different vehicles.  For security, we also wanted to be able to quickly remove the GPS unit itself.After watching the video review posted by another person here, the size of the mount was easy to see and we decided to give it a try.  We have been extremely happy with the purchase.  The mount is made of high quality materials, stays in place without any issues, and works flawlessly with our Garmin.Several reviewers complained about the size in relation to the mount being too bulky to store in the glove box or other locations.  I was baffled by these comments, personally, because we leave the mount in the car all the time.  We do not feel it is necessary to "secure" the mount itself, only the GPS unit.  We simply remove the GPS unit with one hand and store it away or tuck it in our pocket/bag after putting it in a protective case.Other comments pertained to the mount sliding around after a while, and hypothesized it was due to prolonged exposure to heat and/or cold.  Since we have purchasd the mount, we have been in temperatures between 25 and 100 degrees and experienced no residual issues.  Our dashes tend to get very dusty, especially during the Spring, but that did not cause our mount to slide around or move out of place.I have been in vehicles with very awkward hand/or small dash space, so if your dash is very small/awkward or your car extremely small, this mount will probably not meet your needs.  However, even a window mounted GPS unit by itself would be a problem in a very small car.  Overall, we highly recommend this for use with the compatible Garmin GPS units.

$REVIEW.: No more or less than I was looking for - a sleek, slim keyboard with crisp, clear lighting


Don't know why it took so long for a sub-$100, non-gaming monstrosity backlit keyboard to come along, but I can finally take this off my wish list.3 levels of brightness (plus off) are quickly accessible for different room conditions

Really helps me get more done at night when my own body is blocking the light in my office
Probably could use a bit more lift in the back for some users, but doesn't affect me personally.EDIT: I had to come back because I remembered the thing that does bug me about it
Though it doesn't affect any of the other keys, I think the ultra-slim pads cause the space bar to not pick up on every tap

I came from a non-lit slim Logitech keyboard before this and it was never a problem, but now whenever I finish an email I have to skim back through to look for always-present missing spaces...

$review_text.: I found the D-Link Systems HD Media Router 1000 (DIR-657) to be passible wireless router for home use, but also a bit of a disappointment
 My previous router was a D-Link Whole-Home Router 1000 Wireless-N (DIR-645), which had a superior wireless signal throughout my home, by comparison the DIR-657's signal quickly degrades as I approach the outer edges of my house
When the connection is strong, the media streaming is excellent, and if you live in a smallish home or apartment (and are interested in streaming media) I think this router is a good fit for a good price


The firmware has all of the requisite knobs and switches, the SD card slot is a cute gimmick, and the form factor is sleek and pleasant (it looks like a small video game console).


$SUMMARY.: Better for small homes

$REVIEW.: Perhaps I'm spoiled with my Astro A40's, but I just couldn't use these for more than 1 sitting. I ended up giving them to a friend. They're very lightweight, but just didn't fit me well at all. Very snug and wasn't comfortable. I did like how flipping up the mic would auto-mute them. Alas, at the end of the day, I just wasn't satisfied.P.S. If you're willing to shell out $100+ for these, you might just want to consider buying the best: Astros. My 3-year-old A40's blow these headphones out of the water and are VERY comfortable. I could wear my A40's for days on end if I had to...
$SUMMARY.: Too snug, too uncomfortable (compared to Astros)

$review_text.: Originally I was looking for a case/stand combo but already had a sleeve for my 1st gen Kindle Fire so when I came across this product I was excited because it was exactly what I needed. I have used this stand on two flights so far and only in landscape mode for watching movies but so far I love it.  It is very sturdy in landscape mode and it will fit many sized tablets.  The soft pads on the bottom and where the tablet contacts the stand helps to prevent any type of sliding.  This was put to the test on quite a bumpy flight and the stand/Kindle stayed in it's place without any problems.Pros:- Sturdy construction- Very stable- Fits many sized tablets- Works in portrait and landscape modeCons:- Slightly bulkier than i had hoped when folded up, but worth it since it is so sturdy and can fit small and large tabletsOverall, I would definitely recommend this for anyone who has a Kindle, Android Tablet, or iPad and plans to travel with it or wants to be able to use it at a table without having to hold the device at all times.

$REVIEW.: This is a small and handy monocular. The image is pretty crisp and focuses well at lower magnifications.  Based on its performance at 15-25x magnification I would be tempted to give it a 5 star rating. But zoom in and the image gets significantly lower quality and blurry.I recommend this device as a compact and very handy little telescope. But not if you are truly looking for a 40+ magnifying monocular to use in low light or expect perfect image quality.

$REVIEW.: I've tried several different kinds of cases for my ipad -- Apple case, incipio feather, and others. This one is the very best. It allows for multiple angles of viewing; it sits in your lap or on a table very well. It's well made (many people think it's leather), looks good, and protects the ipad very well. It's a sharp item.The only thing I can imagine being an issue is the elastic bands that hold the corners; they will probably stretch out over time, so I'm already thinking how to work on that issue.Great product, good price. Worth every penny. I'm very glad I bought it.

$REVIEW.: Nice bag that fits my ipad (or a netbook) snug in a seperate compartment.  there is room in the outside compartment where i put my charger, a usb drive, pen and 3/4 size notebook.  The outside has a zipper where i drop my ipbone in when traveling through the airport.  Overall a good back and you get that ecofriendly feel.  No real 'concerns', but if i had to say anything, the shoulder strap slides a bit and when you clip the front flap it doesn't go as easy as others.  That being said, I am very happy with this and will be using it for a long time.  No need to take my laptop on short trips when my ipad can now accompany me and do the trick.  recommended.

$review_text.: The case itself is pretty decent and the keyboard works well for my daughter, who wanted a laptop because her tablet didn't have a keyboard (ha ha!).  For her small hands and the fact that she's not a touch typist, the keyboard works great.  Now my son wants one.The keys seem a bit mushy to me, and I certainly couldn't touch type on it with my ham-hands, but if you understand you're getting a small, portable keyboard and case combo for this price, and not a full size keyboard that you can touch type 100WPM on, you should be relatively happy with this keyboard.

$review_text.: When my 2TB hard drive failed, I found a 3TB  hard drive, also through Amazon, which unfortunately would not attach to my DVR server without this card.This card did not work well with either of my HP Pavillion servers.  I blame it on the motherboard, the AMD processor in particular, or Windows Vista but both of these systems would have erratic results with this card.  The Intel server would often get confused about the hard drives at boot up.  The AMD server would freeze up in the middle of storing a movie.  I eventually took them off both of these systems and bought a USB external expansion enclosure for this drive.

 It was running Win98se
 I installed the drivers and then the LAN MGR would not load properly, the Splash Screen was cut off


 That didn't matter I was still connecting with no problems
 Since the card installation, I upgraded 98se to ME and still no problems.One thing you might want to look at is upon setup

 Mark it to Ad-Hoc, once you do this, everything falls into place, it did for me
 I would use this card again and I would recommend it.It connects with full strength (under router, across basement)

$REVIEW.: I just signed up with Netflix and we were getting DVD's sent to us but wanted the ability to just order the movies from our TV. We also wanted the same ability for the Amazon Video on Demand services but didn't know how!!  So when this became available I was completely intrigued.First the box is little, which is nice.  I opened up the box, plugged it in and went through the onscreen directions.  You have to enter your WEP key in order for the wireless network to be detected.  Well, the first time around, nothing.  It wasn't picking up the signal.  So we moved the little box to the top of our TV stand rather than the shelf below the tv.  Tried it again and *Success*.Its fantastic to have all these movies from Netflix and Amazon on Demand at our fingertips!!  It's absolutely wonderful.  We have been enjoying movies and tv shows (episodes we've missed) with ease.  So far, no interruption in service or connection and it has worked like a charm.EDIT: LOVE this machine even more!  There are a VARIETY of channels consistently added to the Roku including Hulu, Chow (food show), Rate Flix (youtube), Drive thru theater (old movies) MLB (sports) the list goes on and on. A few of the channels are subscription services (like Hulu, Netflix and Amazon (to rent movies) but MANY are free channels which we have thoroughly enjoyedIf you are looking for a great way to get a wireless connection to rent movies, watch Youtube on your tv, browse through your Netflix shows and have instant downloads, this unit does the trick!!

$review_text.: I got this after reading reviews that it was a decent camera and the low price also convinced me to give it a try
 Out of the 5+ digital cameras I've had this has to rank the lowest in quality and ease of use.The problems:1 - Extremely slow:  If you have a dog or baby and want to take quick pictures of those precious moments, skip this camera

 The camera takes forever to load from one photo to the next.2 - Settings are a pain:  Every time I needed to take a picture I had to try a few different settings to see what the best option was
 If you leave it on auto you won't get the best pictures so you have to actually choose a mode i.e


indoors

 And you have to play around with a few different modes until you can finally find the best one
 Again back to point #1 that if you want to take quick photos of those precious moments, this is not for you.3 - Poor quality:  I never noticed how poor the quality of the photos actually were until I compared them to some old photos I had taken with my previous camera - Casio Exilim.After a few months of use I decided to take the loss and sell this camera and am now on a search for a new one.Bottom line, don't bother with this unless you want a mediocre camera.

Most of the pictures were taken on a dance floor where I shot over 400 photos with my Canon 580EX II flash.  I never had to change batteries and there is still power left in the unit.  It recharges the flash immediately and I had not a single situation where the flash wasn't firing because the photos were take too fast after each other like I experienced without the unit in the past.  I am very satisfied with the purchase and the price of less than 60 Dollars compared to the Canon unit with over 140 Dollars is just right.

$REVIEW.: Frustrated, I finally read 1 and 2 star Amazon buyer reviews for this product. Most mention software problems. The accompanying software programs the device. One reviewer even mentions her extra work AFTER uninstall, as their software contaminated her browser. I had the same experience; taking 5 hours to fix. Technical and dealer "support" worsened the problem. The product itself may work for older set-ups, but certainly doesn't have the flexibility needed to control newer functions. Not EZ, as they claim. Accompanying software shows last modifications (updates) were August 13, 2008, April 25, 2009 and 'April 27, 2009.  In the fast advancing computer world these dates indicate obsolescence and it shows in the quirkiness of the program. Don't be fooled.  Further calls to Accoustic Research and Audiovoxx confirmed item is no longer made, software won't be updated as device won't allow updates for more recent functions.  One seller, TNN, is not a registered seller voiding the devices warranty.

$review_text.: The keys feel very comfortable when pressed. They kind of spring back in response to my pressing them and that feel great. I was told it has a mechanical feel, whatever that is, I do not fully know as I have never owned a nicer keyboard than this one. I feel as if I am for the first time in my life using a real keyboard, a very responsive keyboard and one that will last.The individual keys are very easy to read. The one I had was hard to see, as the keys were not as well made, not as bright. The only thing I do not like about the keys is that they themselves do not light up in the dark.You see, this keyboard has a three color back light built in. What that means is there are three choices of color and the space around the keys lights up to reflect that choice of colors you have made. You can choose from Red, Blue, and Purple. You can have just that one color or you may have the keyboard cycle between all three. Also, you can speed up or slow down the rate at which they cycle. A nice feature to be sure.The function keys all have a secondary function assigned to them. They control things like the volume, media and more. There are also the standard arrow keys which can have &#8220;WASD&#8221; reassigned to them if you desire. Just remember to switch them back or when you go to type a &#8220;W&#8221; you will get an up arrow instead.One of perhaps the coolest features of this keyboard is that it is waterproof. I personally have not tested this feature. Something about intentionally pouring water on my electronics does not seem right to me. If however I do accidentally do so in the future, I will let you know what happens. There are 4 large drain holes on the bottom of the board to allow liquids to pass through.

$REVIEW.: The hand grip is great as just a hand grip and carrying
It doesn't allow for a lot of freedom in snapping a photo or adjusting settings, but it is much nicer than carrying your camera around your neck so it achieves its purpose and at a great price


The Nikon AH-4 Hand Grip Strap has much more freedom (along with a hefty price tag), so it may be my choice later on


Overall, this is a nice product for the price.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it is much faster than the drive it replaced and works great to play BluRay movies through CyberLink PowerDVD 9


 It does not come with any software, but Windows 7 (x64) installed drivers and I used a copy of PowerDVD that I had purchased some time back
The other BR player in my house is the Sony BDP S550 and this drive smokes it for movie loading time
 This is easily the best upgrade for my laptop.

$review_text.: I've had several iPods and protective cases. This is the best-fitting, most protective case I've come across, at least for the Nano G5. Fit and finish is superior. I don't have a feeling either way about the graphic fade that's printed on the case, but it's better than some of the other designs I've seen, most of which are distracting and garish. The best attributes of this case are its fit and  protection. The iPod screen is completely covered/protected by this model, unlike other versions I've seen of a similar design. Only the click-wheel is left exposed, and that's a good thing.Highly recommended for your Nano fifth generation.

 I connect my PC to my HT receiver using HDMI

 I use bookshelf speakers for my surrounds.The buzzing sound is louder when I play video or games


 I could hear the hard drive loading and mouse scrolling.(I used to get this sound when I was using the coax cable to connect to my cable box

 When I used the Ethernet connection the hum went away)Changing the volume on my receiver or on the studio monitors does not do anything


 Changing the inputs on my receiver does not do anything.My bookshelf surround speakers  have no hum


 When I use headphones on the receiver there is also no hum.I searched the Internet for a solution and my problem was most probably my studio monitors

$REVIEW.: Setting this up was so simple I was really surprised but everything is marked and color coded so it's easy to follow the directions. The on screen directions make it so simple to follow, not like most that get so complicated you finally reach the point where you forgot where you were and have to start over. I ran the updates they said to and it didn't take long at all, less than 15 minutes total. As far as the speakers go they just plug into the back but then you need to place the amplifier near a plug in so that will keep more wires from showing. The sound was clear and very well balanced so it won't blow you out of the room unless of course you crank it up. The Blu-ray player is great and small and easy to use also and it has a touch screen to it. I don't use UTUBE or try to stream music, I prefer to play my music with my dvds instead but it can do that. I did use it for Netflix and it worked well. I think this is a great unit for the price. I've seen others advertised for nearly twice as much and they didn't do anymore than this one does and Sony is a name that has been around since I can remember and I'm 62 so I completely trust them and their guarantees.

$REVIEW.: The keyboard and mouse here are really not terribly remarkable in their own right


 The convenience and price are really the biggest reasons to buy this
 I ordered it during a snowstorm, and it got here the next morning

 Now, that's what we call delivery.The keyboard is pretty good, a good bit of key travel, but they do make a bit of noise as some other reviewers have noted


 The number pad is nice, and the little windows in the keys (scroll lock, num lock and caps lock) is a good touch, as opposed to the traditional setup of having a central area in some corner

My biggest complaint from the keyboard is that, though it is tilted, I tend to like a bit more slope on my keyboards than this one provides, though I did put some paper towels under it and raised it, though it would be nice if there were stands on it.The mouse is pretty pleasant, though it is super light, and feels a bit small in my hand
 However, the optical sensor itself works well, and the scrolling wheel is pretty effective, even if the middle button doesn't always register.I bought this because I need to write a seventy page report and realized (shockingly) that my laptop keyboard was quite uncomfortable for typing at extended lengths of time

 In that scenario, the convenience of Amazon was this bundle's biggest perk as it was delivered to my doorstep cheerfully the next morning


 Overall, the whole product seems perfectly adequate, and at this price range that's about as much as anyone can ask for, especially with the incredible benefit of bundled  shipping costs for it.Biggest caveat I can see is that the box it ships in was comically large.

Works great with the Apps, reading all kind of video files from HDs and my Mac thru WiFi. It's fast and, very important, VERY FRIENDLY to use and understand. Having WD media player and ROKU HD (first sold and second returned) I know what I'm talking about. I'm also delighted with the design and the green logo that lights up when you turn it on.This review seems an Add masked as a user's opinion but, if you have the chance to read my reviews you'll see I'm a pretty picky customer and don't get seduced easily. Actually I keep the 5 stars for the day somebody come up with a real time machine only.Ok, if you're thinking of buying it, GO AHEAD. Don't waste your time on other devices.I hope you find this review useful.

What I found is that this monitor is compatible with an nvidia technology called lightboost, lightboost is a technology for 3D that is designed to eliminate pixel blur
For gaming, specifically FPS gaming, motion blur is a big issue

With lightboost enabled at a 120Hz refresh rate there is about a 97% reduction of motion blur when compared to 60hz refresh rate without lightboost
 This monitor is fantastic and a must-have for anyone who is annoyed seeing blurry pixels all the time.

$REVIEW.: I'll start by stressing that I'm no professional photographer, just an amateur with ambition

Before buying this lens I'd been using a Canon 75-300 USM non-IS lens (the first version) I'd borrowed
That lens was awful, colors were unsaturated, it had horrible chromatic aberration, and pictures were blurry anywhere over 85mm

The 55-250 is a bliss, from the instant I started using it I've been extremely happy with the quality of pictures

Very sharp throughout the focal length range, very little chromatic aberration in few situations, good color rendition and contrast, nice bokeh

Focusing is not the fastest, but it's fine if you don't have too high expectations


Mount is plastic, you don't want to be too rough with it, and that's ok with me, I treat my equiment with extreme care

IS is awesome it's incredibly helpful
Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent telephoto at a low price, forget the cheap 75-300, this one is so much better and 50mm less won't really make a difference.

They sit in your ears sockets but do not require insertion in the ear canal and do not block the sound.The advantage of these earbuds is that it allows you to wear them with absolutely no fatigue, they are perfect for use with an I-Phone for instance.Now, it is easier to obtain a better sound with In-ears buds or larger diaphragms.And this is where the Yuin are coming into play. The standard earbuds are quite light in delivered quality. They have hard time to deliver bass and an even harder time at giving the feeling of a large head stage (sound stage as some call it).The Yuin PK1 do not fail in this register. The sound is impressive and they may be expensive but the cost is worth it. To me, they sound well balanced and on some recordings they really shine and give me an impression of quality equal to some of my best Over the ears headphones.And I insist, they are incredibly comfortable.One thing that bothers me somehow is the cable that gets tangled all the time. I just ordered some detanglers to remedy the issue.The foams provided to cover the earbuds are also a pain in the neck to fit on. Especially the donuts ones. I won't take them either to the gym because they do not block the external sounds and may suffer from the sweat (or fall).Apart from that, no complaint at all. They may even get better with the burn-in but they were impressive from the beginning.The Sennheisers MX-980 are touted by some to deliver an even better performance at a similar price. I have not checked them yet.

$review_text.: I love this little gadget!  I would give it 5 stars if it were a little faster (IE. if it used a separate bus for the flash/network vs. USB) but I understand that would make trace routing more difficult and the board more expensive.  The designers worked hard to keep this thing cheap.What helps is overclocking it a bit.  I would recommend getting yourself some nice copper ramsinks and sticking one on the middle cpu/mem chip so you can crank up the clocks a little.  It makes a difference.  Mine is now doing duty as a media frontend with Raspbmc, and I plan on buying another one to handle live TV backend recordings (tvheadend).  The one unit just doesn't seem to have the oomph to run both tasks at once, but at $35-45 I can spare another network port.

$review_text.: I hooked it up to my router with cable and installed software provided. I then clicked on the icon on my desktop and it logged me into the cameras IP address through internet explorer. I then setup the wireless settings in the interface to connect to my wireless network and applied. As it rebooted I unplugged the cable. It then connected wireless. You can connect to the camera from any computer in the house using that IP address and a username "admin". I changed the password. I also use the App called Camviewer on my iPhone to view and control my camera. This is the best $60 I ever spent in my life...or at least the best value for the money...Plus there is no monthly fees or other cost. Whats not to love. Its great to watch your kids or animals when your away. Also another great software program to get that gives it a lot more features is called ISpy.Update..I have bought two of these...They work great but the first one like to reboot once in awhile for no reason and when it does that it movies in all directions as it resets and never back to the regional location. That's how I can tell it rebooted if not noticing it actually doing it. But for $60 I will put up with it.

And I have to say, it does a fairly good job removing fingerprints and other sundry blemishes which get on a screen and it does it without added chemicals. Is it the grandest tool ever? No, but it does offer a quick and easy way to clean up without much force needed. I can recommend it if you're looking for a dry cleaner for your tablet or computer.

$REVIEW.: I've had this unit for about 6 months, and it came with a "One Free Map Update Included."  There was nothing stating it had to be updated within 30 or 60 days of purchase, and the USB cord needed for the update has to be purchased separately (didn't find that info in the box either.) So naturally when I attempted to update and was prompted to pay $79.99 for the update I was not a happy camper.  I tried updating because the darn thing gives wrong directions!  It directs you to turn right, when you actually need to turn left!The first time I used the device (and in subsequent uses) it directed me to turn the opposite way I actually needed to turn to reach my destination.  That's not too bad if you're somewhat familiar with the area you're in, but if you're in a city 600 miles from where you live it's a problem!  If you miss an exit, there is no prompt that the route is being recalculated, you're just prompted to "Continue on the main road."The feature that anticipates and fills in possible locations for you as you're entering data oftentimes fills in the wrong information and it is difficult to enter the correct information as it keeps defaulting to the anticipated location.  Very frustrating.The Mio was my first GPS (and I had it several years) but the Magellan appealed to me because the screen is larger.  It would have been better to have kept my smaller screen (and accurate directions) than a larger screen and the wrong directions.  I find the device frustrating to use because of its inaccuracy, and do not recommend it.  Unfortunately, I purchased assessories as I thought the update would alleviate my problems.  Wrong assumption, because I'm not willing to shell out another $80 on something advertised as included and that just may not work.  I regret purchasing this product.Shame on Magellan for offering a free update and not following through.

Holds my 17gigs of pictures and documents
I just use it in the phone as a memory stick


It is fast and after a year of recording movies to it all they way to work, still no problems
Now being this big and full, it takes a few seconds for the phone to scan it at power up

Imagine how slow it would be if it was only a 2 or 4 instead of a 10

The MacBook is great as it is, but with twice the ram, it makes it that much better of a computing machine. This in conjunction with an SSD will make one heck of a machine.

$review_text.: This is a very nice remote

It works for all the devices I have, a Magnavox blueray, a Sharp dvd-vcr combo, a Philips dvd and an Olevia 537H

It works perfectly for each individual device, but unfortunately the activity won't set up properly for Olevia TV due to the way the TV handles its inputs


Don't know about other LCD TVs, but this Olevia model handles the inputs by rotating through the source options, not by direct choice

So what happens is that my Olevia TV always remembers the last input option chosen, so every time the TV is turned on it is on a different input source and the number of steps to go to the proper input source is always different

It doesn't matter how the remote tried to correct it, it simply won't work


It took me the whole night to figure this out
To be fair, it is not really the remote's fault but the TV's control design that is causing this problem.However, even with this disappointment it is still a wonderful remote control and probably the only one that actually works for my Olevia TV
Not perfect, but close.

$REVIEW.: The Etymotic ER-6 series are magnificent - they put you in your own world of extremely clear, high-fidelity audio.  One of the fun things about these earphones is that you'll hear new parts of your music that you didn't know were there - instruments you hadn't heard before, background sounds, even the breathing of the musicians.For me, they fit perfectly, though they take a day or two of getting used to.  Don't expect the deep, booming bass you might have with other "bass-boosted" headphones; the bass is good, just not thunderous.  For me, that's just fine, since I don't listen to seriously bass-heavy music. And besides, I'd rather have the amazing clarity the Etymotics give than the muddy midrange you usually have to put up with from big bass headphones.That brings me to another point - if you use these, you'll get spoiled.  When listening to an MP3 compressed at 128, 160 or even 192 kbps, you'll start to hear the compression artifacts of MP3 and start to understand why professional sound engineers hate it so much.  They forced me to re-rip all my music to lossless format, and it's been well worth it.I own two pairs of these, the ER-6 and the ER-6i.  The 6i seems to be a slight improvement, with better bass and sound isolation.  Quite a steal at the price.

$REVIEW.: If you are wondering what tripod to get for the money, this is the one

I always buy my other photography items on the bargain side so that I have more money for Canon L series lens
Buying bargain items is a hit or miss
This one is a total hit


It holds up to a lot of weight for your camera and lens on it
When I have my one full frame Canon on it with a heavy telephoto lens on it, the tripod holds up in the vertical position just like it does in the horizontal position
It comes with 2 tripod attachments
The height is perfect on it


If you are a photographer just starting out or really into photography, this is the perfect tripod for you.It is on the heavy side, but you don't have to have camera shake so know that if it is windy out that the tripod will hold up

The legs adjust to different lengths
If you are into taking beach photos or sunsets near the water, just remember to wash down the tripod legs from the salt water on them

That way your tripod will last longer.I will be ordering another one of these tripods soon

I have one in the studio now, and plan to get another for out in the field.

$REVIEW.: This is a hard plastic case that fits on the iPad1 and iPad2 with portable speakers. The two doors open outward to reveal a right and left stereo speaker with the device oriented horizontally. There is a separate plastic folding system to use to prop it up on a table or desk.  The iPads fit into it perfectly. The sliding mechanism to open the doors is hard to operate. My eleven year old really struggled to open it.This weighs two pounds. I am not complaining of the weight as a problem of design, common sense says that a speaker system has components that will weigh a certain amount. I mention this as heaviness may not be convenient for everyday use. Also I don't like the outward door speakers for everyday use of the iPad2. If you used this as a daily protective case and wanted to use the iPad in a vertical position the speakers would orient up and down, and are in my way. If you want your iPad to be lightweight and slim for everyday carrying around, I'd recommend a neoprene sleeve protective case. So, you may choose to buy both of those two things for two different uses.The speakers are fine at mid-range. At the upper half of the range they vibrated and the sound distorted. However that was too loud for my liking when sitting close enough to have a good view of the screen. In other words this does not convert your iPad into a home theatre with top quality volume at blasting volume levels. But who wants that anyway since when sitting at a distance you can't see the screen! I played music at the mid-range volume and could hear it crisp and clear from thirty feet away in my home. Using it in that manner allows me to use this device in place of a home docking station speaker system. (It would be nice if we didn't HAVE to buy every single type of accessory for these devices, especially if we own multiple devices! I'm trying to combine these to have more than one use.)I am pleased with the quality of sound for the volumes that our family uses. It is convenient to have the speakers as a case system instead of freestanding speakers that are inconvenient to carry around. Because we don't need to use this everywhere and every day we are using a neoprene sleeve case for everyday and using this when we know we want to a louder and higher quality sound system.(The Kindle Fire has the same jack so you can actually use this on the Kindle Fire, when the unit is on a table or desk. Since it was not designed for the smaller Kindle Fire it doesn't fit snugly and it wouldn't work as a carrying case for it. However if you own both devices (as my family does) you can "make do" with this for stable tabletop surface use.)I rate this 5 stars = I Love It because I feel the quality is high and it is great for watching movies and video clips with sound and also is a good enough for me speakers system to play music into a room with.

$REVIEW.: The Canon T2i produces fantastic photos and video.  If you have issues with the lens quality of the kit lens, it's easy to change that by using a better lens.For the average family video, which the price range of this camera is enticing, this isn't the ideal video camera.  It's tough to see the image in the LCD viewfinder in bright outdoor light, and the image does not show up in the EVF (electronic viewfinder).There is no auto focus in the video mode, and changing focus manually creates shaking in the video and mechanical noise in the audio.  The large image sensor that creates such beautiful depth of field shots also makes focusing too critical for an auto-focus system to work accurately on the fly. So give us a totally manual focus lens with footage readouts that a good photographer can develop a "feel" for.For film use, there is no headphone jack to monitor the audio, and the camera person can't see the image on the LCD or the EVF if they plug in an external monitor (for the director).A few inexpensive changes would make this the perfect camera.  It has stunning video and photo quality, as I mentioned earlier, at a truly affordable price.  Making the focus easier, adding XLR inputs, a headphone jack and allowing simultaneous use of the EVF, LCD and external monitor would make this the perfect camcorder.Most users may not realize the video is limited to 12 minutes per clip.  Not a problem filming short scenes, but you can't use this for filming a continuous two hour lecture. Both the T2i and T3i have a serious flaw recording video. When the sensor gets hot, the camera randomly stops. It can be a few seconds, or a few minutes, but neither can be relied upon to record video all the way to the end of the 12 minute clip limitation. Stills are not a problem.My biggest gripe with this camera is I have yet to find an SD card that is reliably fast enough to prevent the camera from stopping the recording on it's own.  The camera has an internal memory buffer that takes in the video and puts it out to the SD card.  If the SD card can't take in the video fast enough, the buffer fills up and the camera simply stops recording.  I have noticed some SD cards work better than others.  Some class 4 cards work better than some class 10's.  Sometimes I can go all day without a hitch, while other times, with the same video settings and the same SD card, it'll quit a minute into the shoot.  I do not have this problem with my Panasonic dedicated video camera, even when I use the same SD card and the same high video data rate.UPDATE:  I downloaded a third party firmware add-on that provides control over several functions not accessible by the camera's own firmware.  One of these is the ability to change the data rate of the recording.  By setting the data rate at 90 percent, I have solved the problem of the Canon T2i from freezing during recording.  The quality difference is barely perceptible, and only then if you are looking for it.  This firmware also adds audio level metering, adjusting the audio levels manually, and turning the AGC off so you don't get the hiss behind the audio track.Rick Bennette

$REVIEW.: Got these on a deal on Amazon for only $60 each.  These are the best sounding speakers I own now.  I didn't think they would be THIS good when I received them because they are a little smaller in size than I thought they would be.  To my surprise, these are amazing. At their regular price of $120 each, they are STILL very much worth the price.  I wish I had purchased 2 more for my office.
$review_summary.: At the right price, these cannot be beaten unless you jump up to speakers in the $500+ range

$REVIEW.: Part way through loading the drive with media, it suddenly reported that the drive was read-only. I unplugged and let it sit overnight. The following morning, I was able to plug it in and delete a few folders before it again told me that the drive is read-only. After repeating this a few times and trying to write or delete, it will eventually never be able to change any data. I sent it back and exchanged the drive. However, the same situation occurred again. This device does not have a physical read-only switch, and by googling my situation, others are having to jump through hoops for a small chance at fixing it.

$REVIEW.: I've owned these ANC3s for a while but recently read about the improvements baked into the new BoseQuietComfort 15and decided to take the plunge and see if they really are worth the money.  I fly 35 weeks/year so blocking out the sonic horrors of modern-day air travel is my primary goal for these headphones.  I have purchased a number of headphones over the years trying to find the right price/performance balance but had not yet taken the plunge on anything from Bose.  I had an opportunity to spend an hour on my flight home yesterday comparing the QC15s to my two current favorites, these ANC3s and theAudio-Technica ATH-ANC7, and I was surprised to see that the Bose came away in a distant second place.  Understand that I am not an audiophile so I am judging purely based on sound isolation.  To my ears, the sound quality of all three is so far ahead of cheapo, disposable headphones that any further differences between the three are impossible to distinguish.The ATH-ANC7 are over-the-ear like the Bose and in many respects are pretty similar.  The Bose are more comfortable in terms of materials and seem to have a higher quality overall.  The Bose also have significantly better noise reduction qualities.  If I wanted to stick with over-the-ear and was deciding on spending the extra cost to bump up to the Bose then I definitely would.The ATH-ANC3 are in-ear of course so it is a little bit of apples-and-oranges comparison with the Bose.  They aren't the "jam into your ear canal" design like something from Shure, but they are meant to fit snugly inside.  In comparing the sound isolation between the ANC3 and the Bose it was close but the ANC3 definitely had a slight edge to my ears.  I like the quality of the active noise-canceling from the ANC3 better than the Bose (turning each on and off while leaving the headphones on) and then the in-ear isolation of the ANC3 provides a little extra bonus.  Add to this advantage the fact that the ANC3 are far, far smaller (a great little case that also fits my iPod) and have a monitor button that let's you hear what is happening around you without removing the earphones, and the gap between the two widens.  Finally, consider that you can buy 5 pairs of the ANC3 for the same cost of the Bose and there is absolutely no contest.I think I am going to try something from Shure or Etymotic to see if the true in-the-ear-canal design can provide better sound isolation, but if I decide to stick with an active noise cancelling system it will most definitely be the ANC3.UPDATE - So I purchased theEtymotic Research HF5and was absolutely blown away by what a great job they did with sound isolation.  I was able to listen to music at literally 1/2 the volume and still get far more sound isolation than provided by any of the options mentioned above.  At one point on my flight this morning I realized that I wasn't hearing the plane but rather was feeling the vibrations coming up through my feet - as soon as I lifted my legs off the floor the "sound" went away.  I had really disliked the feel of a pair of Shure that I had bought years back, but the HF5s with their flange tips felt great.  I was wearing the earphones comfortably for 7 hours and from airport to plane to airport to train to NYC streets I was traveling in blissful solitude.  **Highly** recommended!
$SUMMARY.: Awesome compared to headphones that cost 5X as much

$review_text.: Enticed by the price, I bought this set and now know why it is so inexpensive. The uv lens produces a lot of glare and ghosting that ruined many, many of my pics. I have since replaced all my filters with sigmas and hoyas (sigma is the best!) and will never buy cheap again. Don't try to cut corners here by ordering inexpensive filters. You've spent the money on your camera and lenses, so spend the extra 10 bucks to get a decent filter because these will not only depreciate the value of your photography, they can ruin your lens if the threading gets stuck like it did on my canon 28-105mm. Fortunately, I was able to remove it without damaging my lens, but I learned a valuable lesson.

$review_text.: Having been a photographer for nearly 30 years, I have had my share of love affairs with glass, and I won't claim to have abandoned every other lens, but I can say that when I want RAZOR sharp focus and detail that actually challenges my a7R sensor, this gem is a beast
 It's small, light, VERY fast (don't let the 1.8 fool you; the light throughput on this lens beats most all Canikon 1.4s and gives the 1.2s a run for the money speed wise, and blows them ALL away resolution wise ), and has that peculiar Zeiss depth and separation, producing a very noticeable &#34;3D&#34; quality, visible even on the LCD.Larger prints seriously make you feel like you could literally reach into them


 The clarity and very controllable resolution, perfect color and believable contrast sell enough EXTRA prints that it will have paid for itself in another week or two, so the admittedly sky-high price is, in the end, pretty easy to swallow
 The performance, dollar for dollar, is a steal.It's not cheap by any means, but as much as I hate to constantly repeat myself, you get what you pay for

 In this particular case, you get AT LEAST what you pay for, and if you generate income with your camera, this is an unusually solid investment that yields returns very quickly.If you own the a7R and DON'T have this lens, shame on you.There is ONE *auguably* sharper lens on the planet, but it isn't autofocus and costs 4-6 times the price of this
 Once the sticker shock abates, it really is a no-brainer.

It seemed like a good idea at the time, especially since the disks were skipping when I try to play them.The disk repair kit doesn't seem to help, unless the scratches are so trivial that they don't affect playing, in which case, why bother with the disk repair kit?I have grandchildren, and it's impossible to watch them all the time, so disks get scratched, lights are left on, candy wrappers are left in places other than trash cans and the TV screen is constantly covered in finger smudges.I can turn off lights, pick up candy wrappers and wipe the TV screen, but apparently I need to discard all of my Christmas music.

I installed MS Office Pro and even Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 on the tablet.  They both run fine.  You are not going to want to do too much multi-tasking and it take some time to switch Windows 8 profiles.When I was getting it setup how I wanted everything I tested it writing some code in Visual Studio, I expected it to be sluggish.  It was not.I would not try to get into 3d gaming with the Acer Icona W510, however it works great for the little games my wife plays from the Windows store.I could not find and definitive comparison between the different W510 models so here is a little cheat sheet:Using Intel Atom processor all models run the full version of Windows 8 (not Windows 8 RT)Acer Iconia W510-1422 10.1-Inch 64 GB Tablet with Keyboard Dock (Silver)(this model) the one I bought.Windows 8Keyboard dockAcer Iconia W510-1666 10.1-Inch 64 GB Tablet (Silver)Windows 8 (no keyboard / dock)Acer Iconia W510P-1406 10.1-Inch 64 GB Tablet with Keyboard Dock (Silver, Windows 8 Pro)Windows 8 Pro.Keyboard dockAt first I considered the model version which ran Windows 8 Pro, however we don't have a need for the BitLocker, Boot from VHD, Client Hyber-V  . .  features. They just were not worth an extra $150 US at the time of purchase.Pros / ConsPros:1) Faster than I thought it would be.2) Good battery life (the keyboard with battery even better).3) Full size USB port on the keyboard.4) Small size (easy to carry).5) Can run desktop apps not just apps from the Windows Store.Cons:1) Screen is a finger print magnet.2) It is a little heavier than I thought it would be (especially with keyboard, my wife doesn't think it is heavy).3) It is just a bit top heavy when docked and using on your lap, on a flat surface it is fine.4) The WiFi antenna is a bit weak.Had I not been disappointed in the strength of the WiFi antenna I would have rated this five stars.

$REVIEW.: i'm a professional photographer, former news photographer, news/photog editor, and currently shoot my artistic shots at night in L.A. city night conditions. i also shoot headshots/fashion/etc.i've chosen canon and with my t2i had gone with la creme de la creme, the 'L' lens in everything but name only, 17-55 2.8 image stabilized canon efs lens. that became my standard for a top canon lens. since i am soon going to the canon 5Dmkiii for increased night iso and resolution, and that efs lens won't go full frame, i had to come up with an all/everything lens that would also suffice as a superb night zoom lens...my 'art' shots are still journalistic and at 3am at 9th and broadway i'm not going to be changing primes.that left precious little to go for. the canon 24-70 2.8 red stripe 'L' lens did NOT have image stabilization, which on canon is worth a good 3 stops if you're not a heroin addict with the shakes. so i did not wish to lose 3 stops.that then left either the NEW tamron 24-70 2.8 VC or this canon 24-105 4L. i was frightened of going 3rd party, even tho tamron is respectable. sadly, i'd read an unfounded review knocking tamron VC (image stabilization) so backed off and went for this 24-105, which reviews said was so good it could shoot wide open at f stop 4.enough back story. the 24-105 cannnot, does not, and will not shoot at f 4 sharp, or sharp enough, to satisfy good standards except perhaps in bright light. i don't know, since i try my lenses at night to see if they will do.a few days before getting the 24-105 i went out and shot with my 17-55 canon 2.8 at f4, and 3200 iso on the t2i, and got respectable results that would hold me until i get the 5Dmarkiii. i wrongly figured this would let me know what to expect with the 24-105 4L at f 4.when the 24-105 came several days later i was blown away at not only the poor sharpness at anything but the middle at f4, but also the (oft mentioned) badly noticeable barrel distortion this lens has.i was angry. i now had the only choice for a full frame lens for low light being the tamron 24-70 2.8 VC. or a 85 prime if no zoom would do. i tried the tamron, holding my breath.you can read my review of it on the amazon ad page for that lens. it's stellar, what you'd expect a canon 'L' to have been.on the other hand, this 24-105 4L is what you'd expect a mediocre third party lens to be. it doesn't even live up to canon's own standard, represented by the 17-55 2.8 IS canon lens, which isn't even an 'L' lens.if you are a daylight shooter and don't plan to take any wide angle shots (yeah, right) where huge barrel distortion will be a problem, then drop a grand on this lens. for me, this gets the poorest rating not only for not performing anywhere near across the board for a premium lens, but for pissing on the expectations of those of us who have bought into the canon reputation.as a note, i suggested this lens to my very good photographer friend, who spurned it saying she was a 'purist' who would only shoot with canon 'L'. she cannot shoot easily, almost not at all, at night because both her 24-70 NON-image stabilized canon 'L' shakes at lower shutter speeds, and this lens (which she owns) falls flat at night as i've explained.so much for the canon lens legend.

$review_text.: The features on this MP3 are pretty standard. The SD storage slot is a nice touch. The screen makes it very simple to play songs by title, artist, album, or random shuffle. The battery life on an iPod shuffle may be better, but for the money, I'd buy this. I was able to fit about 18 full albums onto it using the internal and extertal memory (I had a 1 gig card). The first time I put songs on it, it took a few seconds to load, but after that it worked fine. It even remembers your place when you turn it back on.
$SUMMARY.: Standard, But the Price Is Right

$REVIEW.: Hats off to the technically oriented people that wrote up some great instructions in the reviews!  I would add that changing the IP port to accommodate DNS pass-thru so that the camera can be used and manipulated remotely is not very difficult, but one must be aware of a few basic potential and somewhat immediately recognizable pitfalls.1. Set the IP address first so that the camera can be accessed on the network, saving the changes to the camera.  Again, use the hard wire connection first to set the IP, let it reboot, then you can set up the wireless connection while still hard-wire connected if that's what you wish to use.  If your home network router/gateway is the typical 192.168.1.1, set the camera for a static IP address based on whatever rules you may have set up for DHCP.  For example, you may set up your router to assign IP addresses from .100 thru .254, leaving from .2 to .99 available for static (manual) IP assignments.  Assign your camera IP address to fall in the static IP range.  In the example, maybe use 192.168.1.61 as the camera's IP.2.  After saving the camera's IP address it will reboot as others have noted.  Go back in to the network setup and assign a port different from 80.  Standards exist where emails and Internet access in general use ports 25 and 80.  Port 8080 also has a standard use.  Almost every other port is subject to assignment by users for specific functions.  You may choose say Port 81 for the IP camera's port.  Note that when you select save settings the camera will once again reboot but this time you will not be able to access the camera in the same windows screen.  In order to view the camera locally, you must enter the camera's IP address followed by a colon then the port number.  For example, if you assigned IP address .61 for the camera and use port 81, the new url for the camera would be 192.168.1.61:81.  BAM - you're connected.  I believe someone else mentioned that there needs to be a unique port for each IP address to be remotely accessed.  You might consider assigning the IP address to be the same as the port number for ease of reference...  Or use your own logic and method...3.  As clearly written by others, in order for a dns server to enable access to the camera, you must set up the router to pass your new camera's port assignment through from the firewalled (home) side to the provider (Internet) side and also identify the IP address of the device that has been assigned to the port.  Hence the requirement for assigning a static IP address to the camera.4.  I used no-ip.com in order to purchase a domain name, which I plan to develop for a few other purposes, but I ran into trouble with my four-year-old Linksys router.  It does not support no-ip.com as a DNS provider.  I may upgrade or try to find a work-around, but you might want to verify that your router can support the DNS entry if you use your own.  Otherwise, the DNS site on the bottom of the camera enabled entry for remote access to my Android right away thru my cellular providers' network.  Maybe others know of a work-around?Now to play and get a few more of these running and getting software up to set up my own little security network.  I can't speak for long term quality, as I've only had this up and running a few weeks, but for specific applications, it should work just fine.  Keep in mind pro cameras are up around $2k, so you're not going to get 100 yards of night vision and HD quality...I didn't find the software that came on the cd very useful, but again, remember what you're paying.  If the software had a few more features (and actually let me see the camera quickly), the rating would have been five stars.  At least let the software control the camera and provide a view screen that works as opposed to having to use the web browser interface.  Over the next few months I'll likely purchase Blue Iris or some other similar program and take this to the next level.  Enjoy
$review_summary.: Great features for the price

$REVIEW.: I just recently got cheated out of my car getting fixed when someone backed into my car because they lied on the police report and the insurance company. Went online looking everywhere for a camera to record everything in case the situation ever happens again. This camera works great for that reason.Pros: Video quality is alright for the price, mounts perfectly behind review mirror, small and portablecons: Setting up the rear view camera is easy but a mess trying to find how and where to secure the wire, night time video is not so great, camera gets very hot, Not all buttons work on the remote that comes with.Overall for the price you are paying for it and a little extra for a memory card you cannot beat the price to help you out in  insurance claims.

$review_text.: I should have known ... you get what you pay for. I should have known what to look for in the pictures ... WAIT!!! The pictures do not depict what I actually got!1) DROP HAZARD: If you only ever carry your tablet in landscape mode, this should protect it well enough. I'm not that consistent. When I placed it in portrait mode and gave it a little shake, my Nexus 7 fell out ... onto a pillow 6" below. I would NEVER entrust a piece of valuable electronics to a case that will let it drop. Ever!2) No manual. Nada. Nil. Zip. This is significant since it is apparently necessary to change some settings on your table for the keyboard to work.3) The keyboard has a standard A USB plug on it. I received also a cable that went from a USB-A receptacle to a USB mini-B plug. This is the type used on a lot of portable drives. The tablets and Android phones that I've seen (including my Nexus 7) all have a USB MICRO-B receptacle, so this cable is USELESS!!!4) Regardless of what the pictures show, no additional adapters were included.SAVE YOUR MONEY! If you want a protective case, then get one that will actually PROTECT your tablet. Otherwise, make sure you back up frequently and carry insurance against droppage.I'm returning this item.

$REVIEW.: Cable works just fine. Layout is RED-YELLOW-WHITE which is doesn't follow the normal set up, but it does not effect anything. Yellow (video) cable is a thicker cable than the red and white (audio) cables which either means it is a thicker gauge or has more insulation. Either way, the thicker video cable is a plus as it helps keep the video quality over distance.

$REVIEW.: This is indeed an excellent macro lens, as everyone else here has attested to


The construction is rock solid and the lens isn't heavy at all, which some reviews had led me to believe it would be.However, on my E500, the focus is noisy and very slow
Now if all you do is shoot macro then that isn't so much of an issue,  but I'm a little surprised at all the reviewers saying how good this is for portraits

In my situation that hasn't been the case at all.My 14-54 snaps into accurate focus MUCH faster at the long end ( which approximates the 50mm macro, which is why I compared at that focal length ) and with not even a hint of the grinding noise of the 50mm macro or the sometimes very annoying focus hunting
As for the sharpness, if you're a pixel peeper you might notice a difference


I printed out two pictures taken with the 50 and the 14-54,at 8 x 10 size, and I couldn't tell the difference between them with the naked eye.Verdict: macro great, portraiture not
That's my personal opinion and you're very welcome to disagree

I guess I was spoiled by the excellent 100mm Tamron macro lens I used back in the days of film, which was not only outstanding for macro but an absolutely stunning portrait lens.

$REVIEW.: I chose this drive because of the fact that Samsung generally has decent products, so I thought I'd give it a try.It is nicely built and seems to be more quiet than other LG and Liteon drives I have purchased.Apparently this is a Toshiba designed drive.All drives make some noise at high read/write speeds when a disk is not perfectly balanced.This is an OEM drive which means no frills or pretty box, but it was packaged better than all other OEM models I have purchased.You rarely get screws or cables with OEM drives.  I did get a copy of Nero 8 Essentials which did not make or break the deal for me.If you are putting together a new machine, you get screws and cables with the motherboard.If you are replacing a drive, you already have screws and a cable.For some reason, prices of drives have gone up about 25% over the past year.  The price at Amazon for this product was good, and with free shipping, one of the best deals available at this time.I could live without Lightscibe.  I have it on a few drives.  Not worth the trouble as far as I am concerned.It requires special disks and it is a slow process.  Inkjet printed labels are more versatile, color, cheaper and faster to produce.I still use a felt pen for 98% of my disks.

Also, the image stabilization is just terrible--no matter what you do it is shaky (as is the Flip); I just cannot stand watching the videos this camera produced, and the audio flaw makes it un-listenable, too.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this reader to transfer video files from my Canon 7D DSLR camera (CF cards) to a computer while in the field.While the performance of the reader is fine (haven't had a chance to test USB3.0 speeds yet), I am concerned about the build quality of the device.  The reader is all plastic (and cheap, light-weight plastic at that), which is to be expected (especially at this price), but the CF port is fairly shallow, and thus I'm worried about the pins bending if the person using it isn't extremely careful while inserting the card.  If the port were deeper, or there were more housing to act as a sleeve/channel to keep the card in line while inserting, I wouldn't be so worried, but as it stands, I'm not sure how long this thing will last.If you're looking for a cheap reader that will do the job but might not last, this is the way to go.  If you're looking for something durable to use rough-and-tumble and you want it to last... I would suggest looking elsewhere.Pros:USB3.0reads CF and SD (also, MS, XD, TF and M2)comes with flat ribbon USB3.0 cable (though it's quite short)pricelight and smallCons:build qualityCF port isn't deep enough (chance of bending pins)LED flashes to indicate power (not just file transfer) -constant flashing is annoying (I'm not sure that this is the way it's supposed to function, but mine definitely keeps flashing even when there are no files transferring --it's intermittent though --sometimes the light is just solid)

$REVIEW.: I Purchased this cleaning kit as a last resort to fix a skipping CD player used in a kitchen, exposed daily to grease, water, etc. Before using this kit, I've tried all sorts of tricks to clean the lens, from the Q-tip to the air-can, etc and nothing worked. Then when I was ready to assume it was a problem with the CD player mechanism I decided to give it a try and bum! CD player is back to normal, skipping is gone and working perfectlyJust make sure you follow the instructions and in my case I had to use it about three or four times for it to finally work, but it is a great alternative to either repair the player (which can be expensive) or buy a new one (even more expensive).

$REVIEW.: I purchased the iBlason Neoprene Sleeve Case based on the overwhelmingly-glowing reviews here on Amazon, never having seen one in person.Lesson learned.This case -- while serviceable -- does not exude quality in materials or construction.Zipper hardware is particularly cheap: oversized, jangly, brightly-chromed pulls scream 'cost cutting.' (I am not even sure they are metal; all I know is that they make me dislike the case more and more every time I pull one of them.)The neoprene material is thick and lumpy, especially when coupled with the additional accessory pocket.Initially, I thought the small accessory pocket was a great idea -- in fact, it was what inspired me to buy the case -- but that was only until I saw the it in the flesh.It adds a lot of bulk to a case, yet the additional storage area is surprisingly minimal in return for the additional bulk. You can fit a Lightning cable in there, or perhaps some ear buds, but that is about it.All told, the iBlason neoprene case manages to underwhelm on many fronts, but isn't a complete disaster. In the 'pro' column, it is lightweight and (relatively) inexpensive. Those are the most complimentary things I could say about it, were I feeling charitable.Realistically, though, it feels like a semi-disposable case that should be in the $5-10 range.At $18, it is very close in price to much better-built cases like the Tom Bihn iPad Cache (a zipperless sleeve made by the awesome Seattle-based bag maker).My advice would be be to spend a little more and get something that feels good in your hands and that you will enjoy using, rather than spending $18 on the iBlason.

$review_text.: It really is a beginner's DLSR, mainly because the features reflect the basic DSLRs such as ISO speed and white balance, spot metering etc


but still is under par when compared to the EOS 50Ds for example

But is complete value for money if you are looking to get started in photography, which I believe is more about taking and framing a picture with good composition skills
Once that has been accomplished you can aim for better equipment


But all said, it IS a DSLR.

when you want to take that awesome shot, you can always get your awesome lenses which is such a huge segment in DSLR photography
So I would definitely recommend the EOS 450D to anyone starting out with some amateur photography
Go for it!P.S

+ves - Lighter, good display, ease of use, cost-ves - ISO speed max - 1600, not a higher end DSLR

$REVIEW.: The idea of an external drive dock for hot-swapping and easy management of bare drives rather than piles of external drives, cables and enclosures seems nothing short of brilliant to me.  On the downside, my particular motherboard chipset does not support the eSATA hot-swapping function, so I must power off the computer each time to disconnect a drive (or blue screen of death or spontaneous reboot) - but that won't be an issue for everyone, depending on their chipset capabilities.The question on quality comes with the failure of the Power-On, blue LED, which died on the second day I had it.  It has appeared for a few brief moments in the past couple weeks, but otherwise it never comes on anymore. I should probably try to exchange the unit.In spite of the LED issue, the device seems to be working fine, but it is rather impossible for me to know if it is powered on or not unless the activity LED blinks (red) or unless I closely inspect the powerswitch and whether it appears to be depressed or not.  The LED failure could just be a fluke, it happens, but things like that on barebone type of external interface devices makes you wonder a little bit about the quality of craftsmanship and materials used.  Hmmmm.... I'll try to get a warranty replacement and see if unit #2 works better.In any event, I think it is wonderful product when considering the convenience it provides and the money and clutter-reduction savings it offers by allowing rotations of numerous backup drives in a bare-drive fashion - no additional wires, power cords, enclosures, etc.  The eSATA interface is quite nice for the speed too, and my particular hot-swap incompatibility issue could be avoided if I used the provided USB interface instead, but that is slower for doing multi-terabyte backups, so the reboot seems tolerable for the time savings in some cases.So 5-stars on general design and concept, but -1 star for flakiness in performance (LED failure after two days). So... 4 stars overall.

All I can say is wow
I love this case

It fits perfectly, turns on and off as it opens and closes

securely closes to protect the screen, the stand is very useful and looks great! And the price was great! I'm very pleased with this case for my Kindle Fire (which I love as well).

I haven't had any problems with this

And as long as you have good speakers there shouldn't be much static
U can use your mp3 player or a sd card (which I prefer) to store the music

$REVIEW.: I just got this today and I have to say I was very happy with the quality and how easy it was to put it on the NEX screen. It was a sunny day when I first tested it and the glare was very bad, it was very hard to see the screen on the NEX even with the brightest setting. If you take a lot of pictures outside like I do, I would consider it twice or check out other products, I personally will keep it given the quality and the ease of putting it on and off, I also would rather have this protector over "sticky" ones.

$REVIEW.: I bought this case to store my telescope eyepieces which are very expensive and very susceptible to "bumping around".  It is a little bigger than I envisioned, but (as it turns out) just the right size for all my "stuff".  It seems to be made well.  The "cubes" remove and "form-fit" quite well, and the rollers (which I thought would just be in the way) actually keep the case off the ground when I take my scope out for public viewings.  All in all, this is a nice case for the money.  I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their valuable things protected against the invariable disasters that always seem to happen sooner or later.
$SUMMARY.: Really great case

$REVIEW.: I have accumulated a number of wifi devices over the last year so desperately needed to upgrade my old linksys E900 router, especially since I was trying to set up VOIP.  I had planned on using the 5ghz band for VOIP and everything else on the 2.4ghz, but the range is so small on the 5ghz that I need to use the 2.4ghz for everything.  The router worked without any problems for over a month, but then it quit working (sending a signal without internet).  I have my old router still hooked up and had internet through that, so I know it wasn't the router.  Powering down all the equipment multiple times did not help and it took a long time to figure out, but reinstalling the software from the disk eventually fixed the problem.  Now it seems like once a week I have to go into the software and set up the router again.  Its very annoying when it happens and hope its not a sign of something worse to come.

$REVIEW.: Another excellent EVGA product
I can't say enough about it

The quality of the materials used are just top notch, and every product works amazingly right out of the box
I never have to worry about anything I get from them
This power supply is no different


Fully modular lets you choose which cables you need, so you don't clutter your case, allowing excellent air flow


The power supply itself is small, fitting into normal sized cases, and aligning with normal air flow systems.I ran this power supply on a detector the first 3 days of owning it, and the voltages, temps, and levels are all way above gold standard


No choppy voltages, no weak rails, no sound, nothing

Just smooth constant power everywhere you need it, with more to spare
The power supply remains cool to the touch even after a days worth of gaming


 If you are running an enthusiast system, do yourself a favor, get an EVGA power supply.

$REVIEW.: I received this bag as a Christmas gift, via Amazon, from my brother.Very nice bag, right sized for my needs.  I like a camera bag that has room, protects my gear, easy to wear/carry, and easy to access.  This bag hits on every count.My gear for the record - Sony Nex 5n, pancake lens, 18-55 lens, and a old lens on adapters.  Spare battery, spare SD card, various lens caps, monopod.Pros - see above, materials are very nice, craftsmanship seems very good - straight/tight seems, no loose threads.  The interior has a light green color, making easy to see small items in bottom of bag.  Sling is very well thought out, very nice clasp, decent pad, but most impressive - the very simple and effective containment stap for holding excess sling when you tighten sling up into a handle.  The ability of the bag to expand is nice, allowing the choice of volume or compact usage.  I like the removable camera box concept this is designed around, opens some flixiblity in how this is used.  Very well thought out, and meets my needs.Cons - read this with caution, for these cons are only for those who dont read and understand the bags physical size and configuration.  Only has a single sling, bag size is smaller, for people who dont want or need a large bag.  Box in bag has 2 spaces - gear might need to share space.  For guys, this might appear to much like a purse - get over it.So why 4 stars, well I only give 5 to outstanding products.  This is very close to 5 stars for me, not quite.  Very very good bag, highly recomended.

$review_text.: Nikon D3s12 MegapixelsAmong currently available full-frame digital cameras, Nikon swept the top three positions, starting with the $5,200, 12MP D3s. First of all, there's the eye-popping maximum ISO of 102,000. Yeah, signal to noise ratio at that setting is only 15.8, it still goes where no camera has gone before. While its overall image quality score is high, its low-light ISO rating, 3253, sets a new standard. With a signal to noise ratio that starts at 42.6 at ISO 200, the camera suppresses digital noise effectively through ISO 3200, and doesn't dip below a 30 dB signal to noise ratio until it reaches 6400. With grain-reducing software, it is possible to get good-looking shots with this camera at ISO 25,600!

$REVIEW.: I have 2 computers, one is an older one that I put win 7 32 bit on and the adapter worked ok on that one after going to a forum to find out that the IDE drive needed to be jumpered as master to get it recognized. The instructions are VERY slim.Then I tried it on my new win 7 64 bit computer and it would only see the IDE HDD as a "Removable Drive" so I have no access to it to reformat etc. and now it's not even seen anymore.I tried StarTech support but although they did FINALLY respond, their solution was to do what I have already done with no results and then they quit responding. So much for support.I gave it 2 star's since it did work on my older computer.Update:It quit working on my older computer also so I dropped another star. I guess I will have to try for a refund.There are a LOT of good reviews for this adapter and I have another type of StarTech USB system which has worked great so far but this one is junk.

$review_text.: This Samsung 51" plasma has replaced a five year old Samsung 46" LCD which has been moved for use in another room
 I was unprepared for the improvement in image clarity over the LCD set, but it is undeniable


 It required some tinkering with the settings to get the ideal picture for me


 The screen is very reflective, as I expected, but the light in this room is controlled and I watch movies in total darkness at night.The audio quality of this model is a great improvement over the older LCD unit which sounds like a 1940 radio


 But I never use the TV sound anyway as the TV is actually a component in my audio system and sits between two B&W; DM6 monitor speakers that have great sound imaging
 When a sound source is supposed to be coming from the center, people swear that the sound is coming from the TV screen but, of course it isn't.Very happy with the TV except for one important thing

 It has no RCA type L & R audio outputs


 Fortunately the Blu-ray player and my cable box do have them and I had to use these to get the TV audio into my audio system

 My older Samsung LCD TV does have these audio outputs and I was sorry to see that Samsung has decided to eliminate them.

$REVIEW.: Sits VERY close to the wall.  Mounted on brick, used Tapcon screws into the mortar, could hang a elephant off of it (if that was actually possible).Other reviewers are right, it is VERY tight behind there, plan your cord runs accordingly (if applicable - mine run up outside the brick into crown molding and around to the av stand).Only small complaint surrounds the instructions document.  Everything is good except how the release cord works and how it effects the intersections of the mount.  There are 2 clips underneath to prevent pulling the bottom of the tv out too far.  Good concept, not well described in the instruction manual.  If you do not pull both cords down in harmony and pull the tv out while doing so, they will stay engaged (good for safety, mind you).  Took some trial and error on my part, but it's all sorted now.  Once you master that part, the tv comes away from the wall with plenty of room to spare to make your connections (mine is Samsung UN55C6500).Once up, it looks beautiful, right up against the wall.  Unboxing to having the tv up on the wall was about 30 minutes (and i triple checked EVERYTHING, so that was slow going).  Very much recommend.

The automatic ambient light sensor is great for this, and the speakers are acceptable for playback. Of course, it shouldn't be used for critical monitoring when it comes to exposure, color, etc.--but, being 1080p, it works pretty darn well for focus check. Another bonus is that by shaving off a little of the box's protective cushioning, it will fit back in the box with the stand attached, making for a nice little case complete with handle.

$REVIEW.: The nano is cute for medium to short fingers and it works well. If you can hold a basketball with palms facing down, this would be a stretch to work with those fingers. That's why it's a nano, dah!  The transmitter as advertised is small, insert and forget, that's the beauty of having this.  It comes with a nice pouch for transporting but can easily misplaced when not in use. The transmitter can be park within the mice and easily fit in your pocket to make a point on its size. It also comes with a usb extension. I use it on another laptop where the usb is located at the back and I am right handed. For some reason the back and left usb location does not work perfectly all the time on my vx610 but now with the extension, perfect.I gave it a four stars for these reasons. The buttons location for the back and forward can't be inter-change, it's fixed. Since we often use the back button on web page, it is awkward to use. You have to release your grip on the mice to conveniently enable to press. The nano is comparable with the vx610 in price so I compared the two. The vx610 is medium size and have many functions with the ability to customize most primary buttons and fit the hand well.Don't get me wrong, I like it, I'm use to it and because I have another choice. Except for the nano's small transmitter, I believe the mice is pretty basic and comparable to many  medium price wireless mice. After all I have said, it's for keep. It comes down to preference.

$REVIEW.: purchased the Sportster5 to replace a Sportster in our 2001 Toyota Sequoia SUV


The vehicle kit is excellent and includes sufficient details on how to properly route the antenna wire through different vehicle configurations (sedan, SUV, PU truck)


 I strongly recommend that, if your vehicle radio does not have an AUX input, that you get the Wired FM relay to go with this (also available on Amazon)

 This is smaller than older models and the appearance and screen are top-notch
 With the wired FM relay, I was simply stunned at the clarity and static-free signal that we received
 I won't need to plan on purchasing a new in-dash for our Sequoia because this just gave our listening experience and options an extended life

$REVIEW.: My husband and I recently purchased this Sony Bravia, and we are both very happy with it
This is our first LCD/HD TV, and we did a lot of product research before we settled on this model


I think this is an excellent TV for the price

The picture quality is superb, and even standard definition programming looks great on the screen

(However, there is definitely no going back to a standard TV after experiencing the brilliance that is HDTV!) Hooking up the television was a pretty painless experience overall, and the remote and various menus are all very easy to use

I was also impressed with the speaker system on this TV


A lot of the other TVs we looked at had very quiet speakers, but the Bravia's sound system is superior, and adding a surround sound system isn't necessary unless you really want it.We haven't noticed any issues with cloudiness, black spots, etc., which is a relief because that's something we were worried about when we first started thinking about getting a LCD TV
The only minor issue we've had with the TV is that every time we turn it on, there's a strange clicking/popping noise that comes from the back of the TV and lasts for a minute or less
Then the noise goes away until we turn the TV off, and then the cracking noise comes back for about a minute or so

The manual says that this noise is normal, but I still think it's a bit annoying and weird

However, I did some research online, and it appears that a lot of LCD models make these sounds

Oh well.Overall, except for the weird clicking, this TV has been good to us so far

I recommend this product.

$review_text.: These are great for an in expensive alternative to a $900 lens. The picture quality is good but depth of field is very narrow. I use them a lot for close-ups of flowers and other small objects. Use a tri pod for the best results and a remote trigger to prevent shaking the camera especially at slow speeds.conI tried to put all three together but the camera would not make the connection for auto focus so I had to do it manually. Some times the connections on the individual ones was poor, so I had to take it off and put it back on to secure the connection, once that was done it worked fine. Shallow depth of field and results are not as good as you would see with an expensive lens but was fine to learn to explore the tiny world with. Picture quality was acceptable.I don't regret this purchase at all.

$review_text.: I purchased this NAS (network attached storage) with the intent to use it in my home network as a media storage drive and also to access my media and personal files securely and remotely from the road and on the fly. The features that really interested me were the good transfer rates, the WD supported iPhone apps, and the FREE remote access website/interface (also WD supported).The setup is advertised as being very simple and fast. In reality, it did take me about two hours to be able to set up the drive the way that I had intended when I purchased it. It was not too difficult, but it did require me reading the manual very carefully, and multiple attempts at installing the set up software, and also multiple changes to my windows pc parameters.I will say that once the windows (windows 7) issues were resolved, it installed and mapped correctly to my network. I was then able to login to the drive as one would to a router through my browser and configure the actual drive the way that I desired. This included allowing remote access through the iPhone app, and also turning on remote web access and configuring individual household users, permissions, and shares.My household has multiple PCs, and Macbooks as well as other peripherals, all with access to the drive via the local network. The drive showed up correctly on the Macbooks only after it was mapped initially on the PC and configured from the PC. I'm not sure if this is an issue on networks with only Apple computers.Once the drive was set up and configured, it was also accessible by my WD TV Live HD box (which is an excellent product in its own right). The streaming has no lag or skipping and my home network is quite a busy one. **One tip that I would offer to Mybook Live users is that if you are using it as a media server, you may need to change the way that your peripherals accesses the drive in order to enable .srt subtitle files. I found that the WD TV Live HD could not see the .srt files when I had the drive loading as a media server. Only after I accessed it as a network drive was it able to see the .srt files and enable subtitles. I believe it has something to do with the Twonky app which is used when it is in media server mode.As for the remote access, I have found that the web based access is very good and the iphone apps are quite well laid out and easy to use as well. Streaming content such as videos is just as good as Netflix or Hulu+ when using those apps via 3G. I'm sure it has to do with your home network's capabilities as well so keep this in mind.I recommend this NAS to anyone wanting these features. I just hope that I don't find myself needing more space, as I can envision putting a lot of media (movies and tv shows) on this 2TB drive. A great buy!

$review_text.: Jabra I stand up and give you a standing ovation for the Jabra Freeway Speakerphone.  I previously was using theJabra CRUISER2 Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphonebut sadly had to give it up to my dear husband who refused to use a headset.  I did not mind because this way I was able to acquire the newer model.  The Jabra Freeway is the newest model since the Cruiser 2.  It is a tad bit larger, but offers a few more features such as automatic turn on and off with the built-in motion sensor, and acoustically optimized HD quality microphones and surround sound speakers.  You pretty much give all the commands by your voice.  For example when you call comes in, you can just say "answer" or "ignore".  If you want to make a call, just hit the "Voice" button once and say "phone commands", then say "call &lt;John Doe> mobile".  It is that easy.  That is one big difference between the Cruiser 2 and the Freeway.  With the Cruiser 2 you had to hold and count the seconds on the action button to make it do certain commands such as last redial or voice dial.  With the Freeway everything is done with the touch of one button and I don't have to hold it for 1, 2 or 3 seconds!I got so excited about talking about the actual usage of the speakerphone that I almost forgot to mention the setup.  I am using it with the Verizon iPhone 4G and setup with so simple it took less than one minute.  The automated programmed voice is very clear to hear and understand.  This is the first time I have had to actually turn the volume down on a speakerphone because it was too loud! The sound is crystal clear.  I really do not know how anyone can give this item a bad review unless it does not work with their particular brand of phone.  in regards to the FM transmitter functions, it works as well as other types of transmitters I have tried.  There is NO wireless FM transmitter out there that is not going to be static free.  Think about, the only way is be able to be static free is to be directly plugged into your radio and not be "wirelessly".  This speakerphone will be primarily used for phone calls and not for my the FM transmitter.  I can hear perfectly loud and clear by the units speakers and have no need to be using it to play my iTunes music through it.  the speakers alone will be sufficient for me to hear my calls loud and clearly.Now lets get to the Voice Assist.  Forget about it.  Not worth it.  I did sign up for it since it is a free trial offer for one-year but I don't see any use for it.  I asked myself do I really need to urgently send someone a text message or post a status on Facebook?  Is it that important that I can't wait till I am out of the car and on my computer, iPad or iPhone.  I can wait - I am not that important to be posting about my life's every moment for all to know.  Also, what most might not realize is that you have to call a landline phone number that uses airtime off your cellular plan in order to use the Voice Assist.  Signing up was not as much of a hassle as some made it sound.  Just make sure to read the instructions on the Voice Assist website and you should have no problems.  You have to download the firmware upload and apply it, THEN enter your UPC code after the firmware update is applied.  This is for units purchased from Amazon ONLY.YOU WILL LOVE THIS SPEAKERPHONE.  I am curious to see what is next for Jabra since I can not imagine how something so perfect could be improved.  Well now that I think about it, maybe they will come up with "Park Assist" on their next units.  :-)EDIT:  I almost forgot to add one more thing.  This comes with a really nice long micro USB cord.  Not one of those "bungee" ones either.  It is straight and long enough to fit plugged into a 12V that is inside my center console glovebox while charging the speakerphone still clipped to my sunvisor (while parked of course).

As always with cables like these, paying premium prices doesn't really get you a better cable, and I have been happy with other AmazonBasics products I have bought.The cable was easy to use, and I all I had to do was plug it in.  Because this is an HDMI cable it carries sound as well as image, and it is nice to have everything in a single cable.The picture quality isn't as good as I was hoping for.  There is a huge difference between playing from my computer and playing from my Blu Ray player.  The streaming video comes out pixelated on my TV, and the image on the computer screen is clearly superior.  I don't know if this is any fault in the cable, however.  Probably I just need to fiddle around with my settings to get a sharper image.

$REVIEW.: This is a ultrabook that bends backward to please you. I simply love how easy it is to simply push the screen backward to become a tablet, a killer feature for me to use in a crowded place such as a train or bus.The screen is a bright IPS one with 1600x900p resolution that allows wide viewing angles, which is certainly better than that on the Mac Air and very responsive to touches. The body is very thin and elegant, and has zero flex.  The machine is fast and boots quickly thanks to a SSD. Moreover both the storage and RAM can be self-upgraded in the aftermarket, unlike many other ultrabooks. The fan is very quiet unless you stress the CPU.The keyboard is like that of a typical consumer notebook, not as good as those on the thinkpads, but certainly better than the average and has no flex (i.e. touch one key, none of neighboring keys moves). The touchpad does sometimes jump and Lenovo said they will release a new touchpad driver to fix the bug.

$review_text.: I got one for my daughter about 10 months ago for photo storage while traveling.  It worked just great until 2 days before she had to fly to Italy.  Photo download is almost automatic if using a flash card reader and a mini-USB plug.  I ended up getting an Archos 604 wifi for her trip ( a really neat unit but everything is extra- no built-in mini-USBs, no A/V jacks, no AC charger, but a trippy touchscreen and 30GB is a LOT of room= about 1000 photos + 400 songs + 12 movies, and still less than 1/3 full), while sending the AV500 in for warranty repair. The AV500 had a squashed 100GB drive from a swollen THICK battery- stay away from these batteries. ONLY Archos can replace the hard drives- has to do with HDD/firmware serial numbers.  I just got it back after 2 weeks and the drive was replaced with a 120GB drive, but the right button worked intermittently (I opened it up and cleaned the contacts on the circuit (film) board = now OK.  DO NOT do this if you have any warranty left- send it in.  There are plenty of horror stories about warranty work quality, but they did right by me- this time!  Video quality is perfect for me- great contrast, good resolution for my dvdfa3 480x272 vob-avi converted files.  Audio playback/volume is outstanding (for me).  The one tiny speaker is a joke.I haven't tried any video camera recording, so can't say yea or nay. I like it!  It's a little bit thicker than the new Archos stuff, but you get everything in one small box!

$REVIEW.: So, I bought this as a gift for my wife because she's always asking to borrow my iPad but then I seldom get it back for long periods of time.  Our devices are extensions of who we are.  That combined with my corporate use of my iPad as a member of a large IT group that supports several thousand devices, and I don't let go easily.Before I gave the device to my wife I sat down with some droid app reviews and pulled down a few dozen free apps, some of which are pay for iOS but free for droid.  Then I copied her contacts over which ended up FAR less painful than when I initially adopted to iOS from Blackberry years ago.  Curiouser and curiouser, I decided to customize the device for her and pull down some widgets, move some shortcuts around, pull her bookmarks over from her PC, and before long I found myself tossing on a few paid apps and testing out streaming services, using plex to view local media I have on our home network, etc, etc.And it took it all and did it faster than my 4th generation iPad, the interface was cleaner once I got used to it, and suddenly I'm done.  It only took about an hour, but wow what an hour it was.So I put it back in the box, having NEVER charged it from its newpartial-charged state.  I gave it to my wife, who loves it dearly and can't bring herself to put it down.But I have an issue.A big one.I'm stuck on this crappy iPad.  So, I'm thinking of buying a Nexus 10. Not because the 7 is too small, it's the perfect size for most things.  For corporate use, I need a bigger keyboard to remain efficient.If I got more time on her 7 maybe I could disprove that one...

$review_text.: I bought this gadget not expecting much, but needing something to hold my Android phone while it charged in the car. I also needed to be able to quickly glance down and see who was calling without having to fumble for my phone.  Was quite surprised when it worked and kept working, day after day. I originally had it in a newer Honda CRV and it was not in the way at all.  I have now transferred it to a new Sonata and it really doesn't fit quite as well, but I still use it every day. It seems to now get in the way of the gear shift and occasionally the top falls off of it when I bang against it or I have to readjust the bottom part. Nevertheless, it will still hold my phone or my iTouch or anything in between securely; has weathered thousands of miles and dogs crawling over it and I've yet seen any need to replace it.  There might be something that would fit my present car better, but I'm not ready to go back to the drawing board yet.  If I could fix anything about it, I'd like the neck to be a little bit longer.  Still, a solid four stars.

$REVIEW.: I'm one of those guys who would prefer to pay a little extra money to get the "official" Apple product instead of the cheaper imitation Apple product. So buying this didn't bother me at all. I like the smaller design. This is my second USB power adapter...had to get another one because with all the iPods in the family, one just wasn't enough. I also like the fact that this comes with an extra USB cord. Sure, I'd love it, too, if this came with the iPod, like it used to way back when. But times have changed. And I'm willing to pay a little bit more to get a quality product like this. At least I don't have to worry about frying my iPod with some second-rate imitation product. Apple rules. And so does this USB power adapter.

$review_text.: I reported on another review for TX-8255 that I purchased the TX-8050 because the TX-8255 could not handle the multiple speaker configurations in my house without issues.I need to say that so far I am happy with TX-8050


 I connected it to home wireless network by hardwiring it with CAT5 cable to co-located wireless repeater and I am getting all network stations


 The quality of sound is clean and very high
 You can configure the" Favorites" by connecting to the receiver through any PC on the network by typing its IP address on the URL line
 It gets connected immediately and you have at least 20 (may be more, I was not looking to expand) stations to include in the favorites


 They show up on the receiver immediately, as soon as you save the data on the receiver web interface.I used banana plugs to connect to 2 (A/B) speaker outputs, however, it is not necessary if you don't plan to connect/disconnect it often enough.Supplied antennas for FM and AM radios work very well

 The same is for connection to my CD player via optic cable.I have the unit for a week now-it was playing nearly continuously through Christmas and New Year and I  am happy with it so far.

I can't imagine what expensive high-end earphones can offer over these but then I'll probably never know

Jon Hopkins latest sounds excellent as well as My Bubba and everything in-between that I have listened to on these


The only issue has been with the built-in mics performance on my phone

May have been the environment or direction of the mic pickup

Will have to try the mic some more.

$review_text.: I just installed this in my home with my 5 existing cameras and I must say that I am extremely impressed with this sub $200 system.  It even has some features I wouldn't expect it to have.  Specifically, FOUR audio in ports.  Thats just unheard of even in much more expensive systems.  Usually they only have one or two audio ins.Support for ALL smart phone operating systems is EXCELLENT.  QSee has written a dedicated app "Meye" for each phone (Android, iPhone, Blackberry, Windows Mobile, Symbian, sorry no WP7)  It's VERY fast at streaming to my Android.  It all went together so easily I just couldn't believe it.  I bought this expecting to have to hack it here and there to get it to do what I want.As the very diligent reviewer above said, this is not a $3k security system, but it is more than plenty for any small to medium sized area.  You're not getting HD quality bank security footage with this thing, but man does it beat getting up to go see who's at the front door...or anywhere else around the house for that matter.  All I do is flip to channel 3 on any of my TV's or hit the Meye app on my phone (its almost instant!).A note:Setup was easy for me because I'm moderately tech savvy.  For network viewing, I had to fiddle with my network configuration due to the limitation on the DVR's IP address configs.  If you want to use a static IP it needs to have all 12 digits for some reason.  I couldn't get it to work with something like 192.168.1.5 (it needs like 192.168.100.005).  Consider using a static IP for devices that broadcast such as this one to assure you don't loose signal because your router decided to reset...

This 160GB model has all the storage I could possibly need


I've synced my entire iTunes library (some 14,000 songs) and several digital movie copies, and still have tons of room to spare
The user interface on the newest models is superb, with simple menus and vivid color display to show you all those album covers

I previously owned a 5th generation Classic, which was also great, but this one is considerably thinner and has a gorgeous matte silver finish (no more fingerprints to clean off)

$review_text.: After having some really bad luck trying to purchase a All-region/all-video DVD player, I happened onto this during a further attempt to find a WORKING unit.  The Pioneer DV 420K - which seems to be the most fully-equipped of the DV 420 series - has all the capabilities I was looking for.  It is capable of HDMI ouput - which I was looking for - as well as Component, Composite and S-Video.  The audio has HDMI (with surround sound), two-channel, Optical and Coaxial - but the way I read the user manual, Optical and Coaxial are only available if you are using the HDMI feed.  Since I've well run out of HDMI (actually HDMI/DVI) inputs on my AV receiver, the need to have Optical or Coaxial output, which include surround was a necessity.  I'm using the HDMI connection to connect directly to my TV and the Coax to connect to my receiver.  Works just fine.The only issue is the effort I had to exert to get the picture output.  There are a number of places on the user manual that talk about "video connection", but the one I wanted, how to get the correct output for a 1080i TV, isn't all that easy to find.  I also wanted to make sure that 3:4 ratio pictures (old TV programs and movies) were shown correctly while still showing 9:16 movies and newer TV programs correctly as well.  If you dig far enough, and kind of read between the lines, you can get it all set up correctly.  It's a bit scary to see the note that says "you may lose the picture if you try to use a setting that is not supported."  And, in fact, the screen went black for more than a couple of seconds before it came back.  No problem now, I can play PAL DVDs of old British TV shows and movies in 3:4, and I can play any of my newer non-Blu-ray DVDs with 9:16, and they are are shown correctly, and it the best possible picture quality.  That's what I wanted.

$REVIEW.: I wish Amazon would let me change my stars.  I wouldn't give this product a single one.I sympathize for all of you that already have this product.  You deserve a refund and an apology from Linksys, a company that used to make fairly good home networking hardware.  Linksys's quality and support standards have dropped considerably.Maybe I'm an anomaly.  I was able to get the print server set up (convoluted, such that the installation was).  My problem is that the print server loses connectivity with my Canon MF4150.  The USB indicator light on the print server will often cut out - then windows will report a print failure.  This occurred so frequently that I needed to power-cycle the unit of every print attempt.I went in circles with the Linksys tech support (left much to be desired).  Their conclusion was that the hardware was defective.  Rather than send the defective unit back, I exchanged it at my local retailer.  The new unit has the same problem.  Apparently the whole lot of them are defective.However, this only moderately annoys me.  I'm a software developer, so I can understand how version 1.0 of anything can be buggy.  But this product has been out for a long time - plenty of time to get a firmware update out.  C'mon Linksys!  The job's not done yet!  You gave us junk, now FIX IT!So, lesson learned.  I stopped buying Linksys junk.  I hope they either improve their product (and support) or have their market share taken by a company with better products and support.

$REVIEW.: I wanted an external drive for my MacBook Air, one that would not be harmed by mishandling.  I started looking at external drives and found this SSD and the Inatek case referenced in the subject line.  15 minutes total, including figuring out how to reformat the drive for Mac, and I have a great external hard drive.  Once reformatted it works seamlessly with my MacBook Air.IF I CAN DO IT YOU CAN TOO!  I HAVE HAD A MAC FOR ONLY 3 WEEKS AND I FIGURED IT OUT.1) Open the packaging for the SSD drive and the Inateck case.2) Place the extra foam piece in the Inateck case (it didn't seem necessary, but it adds extra shock absorption).3) Close the cover on the case and plug in the USB cable.4) The MacBook Air will recognize the drive, even though it is not formatted for Mac.5) Open Launchpad (I told you that I'm new to the Cult of Mac).6) Open Other7) Open Disk Utility8) Turn on the disk (the Inateck case includes an on/off switch)9) You'll see an entry for &#34;Inateck Media&#34; that is preceded by the size of the SSD drive.10) Click on the &#34;Inateck Media&#34; entry11) To the right you'll see a button marked &#34;Erase&#34;.

It shows the remainder of time and is 100% compatible with my Canon Vixia HF-S200. I use a wall charger with 120vac and I have never had any problem charging the battery and it is always ready to go.

$REVIEW.: I won't use spinning disks anymore for boot drives now that mainline SSDs have hit the 60 dollar mark
They are ridiculously faster for boot, application loads, and well, everything
So much so that a slow processor and fast drive will be perceived faster than a machine with a faster processor and a spinning disk most of the time.Anyway, my own benchmarks for sequential access, just to compare to the advertised speeds:Version  1.96  ------Sequential Output------ --Sequential Input- --Random-Concurrency  1  -Per Chr- --Block-- -Rewrite- -Per Chr- --Block-- --Seeks--Machine  Size K/sec %CP K/sec %CP K/sec %CP K/sec %CP K/sec %CP  /sec %CPzare3  5G  70057  12 44293  9  224887  16  1299  25Sorry for weird formatting, but that is 70.0MB/sec writes and 224.8MB/sec reads, which isn't that far off from advertised speeds


Also note 1299 random seeks per second, which is a 0.77ms random seek time including OS overhead

Try that with a spinning disk.It isn't the fastest SSD out there by any means, but it does fulfill a slot in the low cost low capacity realm, and is still worlds ahead of normal alternatives for boot drives, especially at this cost.I've now bought 2 for storage unit boot drives, and will continue to buy more

Thanks Kingston for making something at low capacity geared at lower price points.

$REVIEW.: REVIEWER BACKGROUND: I've never used any studio equipment before, and am really just starting to get into product photography since I plan to host a garage sale online soon. I used a DSLR with the built-in flash.PACKAGING/ASSEMBLY:The product comes disassembled and took me about 20 minutes to put together with a Philips head screwdriver. The instructions are barely sufficient. The photos are (ironically) are not very clear, since they appear to be grainy B&W; photocopies. I found the glossy product ad that came with the instructions to be very helpful in understanding how the assembled product was supposed to look, and what the names of each of the pieces were.Here's a video review that includes assembly: [...]USE:Once set up, I followed some of the camera setting tips (1/30, wb at 5000K, no flash) from the instructions and took a few photos. Overall, I was pleased with the output. The whole setup was effective in distributing the light evenly around the focal area. Since I'd never used a studio before, I'd never really noticed how small 20" really is. My mom asked me to photograph a flower arrangement she did, and I was disappointed that it easily cleared the walls of the background...rendering a full shot of the arrangement impossible.The entire unit is lightweight, and probably could be easily disassembled but doesn't appear to be designed for mobile or infrequent use. I don't shoot that frequently, so I am not looking forward to figuring out how to store the studio. Also, the overall kit machinery was flimsy, so I suppose the selling major point is that this is an all in one package.FINAL SAY:If you have a bounce flash for your SLR, I think you could put together your own studio for a lot less. If you have a built-in flash with your camera, and need to quickly and frequently photograph small objects then this is for you.
$SUMMARY.: Putting together a product catalog or setting up shop on ebay, with nothing more than your P&S camera? This is for you.

I purchased this for my wife who was having trouble with an unpowered hub not providing sufficient power to a backup hard drive and other devices. We plugged in the Targus, plugged in her USB devices, and all problems vanished. The unit is well designed and does all that is necessary. There are cheaper hubs, but since spending hours diagnosing USB problems is not something I care to do, the Targus represents money well spent. If you're having USB problems, an AC-powered hub is probably the solution, and the Targus is ideal. Highly recommended.

The new battery seems to hold a good charge.  If it loses power soon I will revise the review.  This is a Chinese made battery, not a Sony battery, although the original Sony battery was also made in China.  Maybe the manager of the Chinese Sony factory has another factory where he makes things using technology he stole from Sony and tooling from the same company that supplies the Sony plant.  If so, it would be the same quality.  The battery arrived 8 days after I ordered it.

$REVIEW.: After reviewing several video clips on this AFFORDABLE LED projector I decided to buy one. I have watched at least 10 movies (with my girlfriend) so far and I have to say that we are impressed with it. I am using standard white matte finish plotter paper as a screen and the image quality is surprisingly good (I am guessing that a regular screen would be even better). I am playing DVD's on a standard player with the RCA hookup to the projector. I did have it hooked into my PC and the picture quality was noticeably better.Pros so far:-Decent image quality on a 70 inch home built Screen (plotter paper).-Long projected bulb life.-Inexpensive for the movie quality!!!!-More quality time spent with my girlfriend!-Portable. Can be used with a laptop (with good speakers) and portable screen to watch "Drive-in" movies anywhere (need vehicle / power inverter / battery).-Has a wide variety of connections to choose from (HDMI, S-video, RCA and VGA).Cons so far:-all of the controls are on the remote.-The fan could be a little quieter. (Not a problem when hooked into a good surround / computer speaker system)-On board speaker is not very loud. (Use external speaker source)I would definitely recommend this nice little unit to anyone looking to buy a cheap, decent picture quality projector for the first time!!!-Some light shines through the rear fan exhaust. (This can be diverted by sitting something slightly behind the projector. Do not block the air flow!!!)

This thing is quiet and the green LED light mixes really well with my blue LEDs to make a nice relaxing blue-green color. The amount of air flow is what you would expect from a typical 80mm fan. Nothing amazing, but nothing to be disappointed about.

$review_text.: The 'Sennheiser RS110 Over-Ear 926 Mhz Wireless RF Headphones' -- a perfect example of 'Entry Level' electronics

 My recommendation: it becomes an issue of budget -- if you can invest a bit more and plan on using these frequently, then I would highly recommend looking elsewhere

 I desperately needed to replace my old, similarly functioning headphones and I had some left-over gift certificate credit that covered the somewhat reasonable price.I would not consider this purchase an "upgrade" from my old set -- they look pretty cheap and are on the 'small' side (in all fairness, I do have an inordinately large dome along with large ears -- still, handsome, though ;)Nevertheless, they still provide a relatively comfortable fit
 The sound quality is acceptable and the performance functions as expected
 The controls, like the analog dial-it-yourself channel tuner is very primitive, but not the hassle I initially thought it would be.Some annoyances worthy of the decision-making process: excess noise when either no sound is present or when utilizing certain features on your tv (example: 'Options' menu in various video games)

 Also, I tried connecting to my flat-screen via its headphone input, but the volume was ridiculously low (I thought I was going to have to return my first amazon product!) -- I now use the RCA plugs, which give satisfactory results.I use my headphones for two main reasons, while sitting out on my patio and as a hardcore video gamer
 So for the Gamers: the 'forced surround' sound (example: footsteps from approaching enemies) is accurate enough to recommend, but only because it definitely beats NOT using headphones at all while gaming

 Otherwise, the results are passable


 One note worth mentioning: I use a wireless 'earmic' placed underneath a headset speaker and an online friend of mine was picking up the echo effect you get when mics pick up conversation from external speakers
 This never happened with my old headphones -- this is likely due to the Sennheiser RS110's 'open-air' (perforated venting on outer casing) design


 So, if this might present a problem for you, definitely spend your money elsewhere!The physical quality, though sturdy, is obviously on the 'cheap' side -- the 2-tone speaker casings really accent its overall entry-level cheapness!  Possibly good for kids, as long as they understand how to find a clear channel whenever the inevitable accidental shifting of the, again, analog dial.So, my advice is as mentioned earlier..


these are "take-it-or-leave-it" headphones that I believe will provide me satisfactory results for the time being (I guess for as long as the plastic tabs used to access the batteries hold up)


 Serious gamers, you might be better off with headphones with a built-in mic boom, or at the very least, non-open-air design


 Casual listeners on a budget (or looking to top-off the remainder of store credit) and have 'Replace broken headphones' high up on their 'To-Do' list will find satisfaction that they will get what they pay for.

$REVIEW.: This is a very nice bag.  I prefer it to a previous larger model I had from the same manufacturer.  I use it for a daily walking commute (1.5 miles each way) and for over-night air travel.  It's just large enough to carry a change of clothes and toiletries along with the laptop and peripherals.  I use a larger roller bag for trips of 2+ nights.The organization of the bag and the various compartments is very convenient, and the bag itself is pretty lightweight and easy to use.  The balance between lightweight but still robust is very good.So far the wheels and handle seem well constructed.  The real test will be how long they last.

$review_text.: As we all know, graphics cards in modern-day computers tend to run very hot, due to their very nature. The manufacturers try to compensate for the heat with an on-board fan, but, as is most often the case, these fans are woefully inadequate to efficiently remove the heat generated. I have always added several additional fans in all my computers to keep them running as cool as possible (if I can keep the processors and motherboards under 130 degrees, I'm doing fine!) My latest computer has around 10 fans (including this fan card), and keeps the tower at a comfortable average of 110 degrees, according to Speedfan 4.49 (Google it, and get it! It's a fantastic utility!) I have this card mounted directly beneath my graphics card (an nVidia GeForce 8 Series) to help keep it cool. It does its' job fairly well...there are times when the graphics card gets a bit too warm, despite all the fans (a heavy Duke Nukem Forever session tends to do that ;) ), but, as with all computers, one cannot expect to keep everything from overheating.
$SUMMARY.: Hot graphics card? Use this!

These days, mobile phones take those everyday picture and for the most part, that's good enough
However, no mobile phone can take a better picture than this Nikon (at least not yet)


There are still inherent limitations with mobile phones and for those images that you may wish to send of to have enlarged, or photos that are very important, you want something more- this Nikon delivers
Prices have come way down and you can buy it for cheaper than I did
Despite being over a year old, it serves my purposes great.

$review_text.: I was excited about getting this device and more excited about the price. When I got it I was greatly disappointed that it didn't play any of the video formats which was the main purpose I bought it for. Not even MPEG mp4 avi files played. I did some research and these files have to be converted some special way to play. I downloaded the converter but never got around to trying it.It does play picture files and audio files well though. The buttons on the device means it can be operated without the remote. The device it selfs feels cheap and made of plastic. It's virtually useless to me. I did however purchase the Micca full HD ultra portable version and that fulfilled my requirements. It played every video format I threw at it including for files.

$review_text.: The Sony player arrived today and I hooked it up right away. It was a simple task to get it registered with Sony and to get logged into my Amazon Prime and Netflix accounts. There was no need to read the instructions.Right now, I'm watching a Netflix video and it's coming through just great. Since my desire to watch videos via Amazon and Netflix is the only reason I bought the player, it's meeting my needs and expectations. I can't comment on the DVD capabilities because I'll never use it for that.I like the remote. It's lightweight, comfortable in the hand, and very straightforward button-wise. I also like the style of the player: it's low and sleek and there are no bright lights emitted to interfere with watching the TV. It has a bigger footprint than I expected (I didn't read the specs before ordering), but that's not a problem for me. Area-wise, it's a bit smaller than a standard magazine, and it sits about two or three inches high.If I run into any problems with the player's performance, I'll update this review to reflect that.

$REVIEW.: The Linksys E3200  is, without a doubt, an impressive product. It's one VERY easy to set router that appears to operate reliably and even comes with a couple of notable bells and whistles. However, some of the 'high performance' claims proved to be slightly exaggerated and I wasn't impressed by the quality of user support.My experience with Cisco's refurbished equipment is that it's practically indistinguishable from 'new' except for less warranty coverage and support. Our E3200 performed flawlessly under heavy stress (supporting over 2 dozen devices) for one year already.SETUP (5 of 5)One question most of us ask ourselves before proceeding to set something as intimidating as a new router is 'will I be able to make it work for me?' The good news is that in this case the answer should be 'probably or most likely yes.' For a basic setup, you simply plug in the router, run the Cisco Connect app provided on a CD on a computer equipped with a Wi-Fi adapter and... you are connected.Cisco Connect is a well-organized app that will help you add devices to the network - and once the router is app and running most devices will add themselves once you provide the password - allow for limited 'guest' access on a separate network, set parental controls, test your Internet connection speed and directly manage your router if you need to split your network for better performance, configure DNS and DHCP, advanced wireless settings, security, manage the attached disk if you have one, set access policies and so forth.It gets as sophisticated as you need it to be and the good news is that both Cisco Connect and the router's Web interface are are well organized and are backed by a very well written and quite detailed manual. I will post the link to the downloadable PDF as a comment to this review.My basic setup completed in a couple of minutes and it took a couple of minutes more to register individual devices: laptops, desktops, printers, portable gaming devices, home servers, Internet radio. Anything that has a wired connection (4 10/100/1000 Mpbs ports are available) does not need any setup. The more sophisticated tasks, such as reserving IP addresses for printers and a media hub and 'splitting' the traffic into 2 separately named networks mapping into the router's 2 frequency bands (2.4 MHz and 5 MHz) were equally easy and well covered by the manual.It's important that Cisco Connect is installed on one of your computers if not on all because the first thing it does when you start it is checking the router's status and attempting to fix whatever problems if it detects any. To get 'the latest' I installed it from Cisco's site and I didn't experience any issues during or after the install completed.PERFORMANCE AND RANGE (4 of 5)Depending on your clients, the router can provide as much as 2 x 300 Gbps - this was a major improvement over the 802.11g router it's replacing. This is a lot considering that the best I am getting from my ISP is 15 Mbps downstream and 2 Mbps upstream but today's home networks have a lot of internal traffic if you use NAS devices, media servers or home servers that are set to run backups.While the router supports 802.11 a/b/g/n the manual warns that best performance can be achieved when all clients support 802.11n and that one single 802.11a client can slow the entire network if present.In practice I got consistent 150 Mbps on the 5 GHz band while in the same room at about 30 ft. from the router (except for a few minutes each day when the 5 GHz signal drops for no apparent reason - see the posted screenshots). With one floor in-between, 90 Mbps was possible but the 5 GHz band wasn't as reliable or I could get a steady stream of 54 Mbps, sometimes better on the 2.4 GHz band. With 2 floors in between (router in the basement and my computer on the second floor and at the other end of the house, some 70-80 ft. away) the 5 MHz band became practically unusable (I will post some inSSIDer shots) and the 2.4 GHz band would get me 6-24 Mbps, still okay for Web browsing. The computers on the second floor right above the router get a steady 50-70 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band.I would like to note that, while the router broadcasting on 2 bands does have its advantages the 5 GHz signal works best when you have line of sight to the router or one thin wall/floor in between. It's not as good at passing through walls as the 2.4 GHz signal. It is possible to maximize performance by using a combination of wired plus 2 segregated bands but some testing and good planning is needed.RELIABILITY (4.5 of 5)The E3200 has been remarkably stable so far if I don't consider the random signal loss on the 5 GHz frequency on the second floor. It's fair to state that, when the default settings are kept, the router will automatically switch between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz and between the available channels on each band to maximize performance and minimize interference. Since I don't have neighbors, I can't say how the router would perform in a more crowded environment.Due to a number of violent storms, we lost power for seconds at a time several times in the past few days. Whenever that happened, the router came back on its own and I was able to resume work without having to reestablish a VPN connection or the chat session on WebEx with a Cisco support rep.EXTRA FEATURES (4.5 of 5)The E3200 is chuck-full of advanced features including strong security and encryption and the ability to optimize it for gaming (not tested yet) and, of course, the most visible being the USB port through which you can share files off an attached disk with control over access level on the local network and over the Internet.On my features wish list... I wish it was possible to actually control the signal strength because the 5 GHz band is clearly underpowered. Also, while it is possible to remotely reboot the router, it would have been nice if a physical 'off' switch was available.MY RATINGThis may not be the best n-router out there - Cisco does sell a higher model for a few dollars more - but I suspect it's all the way there at the top. I can't see how you can go wrong with this one. At the 'refurbished' price it can't be beat.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;

Also, the SD slot is so tight that none of my chips can be forced in (I haven't tried any of the other slots)

As far as reading a drive, once installed, it works good as an easy way to use lots of different drives

 I didn't like the software that came with it at all because there's no way to understand the instructions and no explanation for how to use any of it
I played around and finally found one app that installed and, once installed, there's no way to get rid of the shortcut it creates in task launcher-I gathered its some kind of auto backup system, but I didn't need it-there's no explanation about it either

 If all you want is a slick way to access different bare drives as USB this unit will do the job, but I wouldn't buy it just for the other features.

$REVIEW.: I already had a couple of Airport Express base stations and bought the Extreme solely for the Modem port so I could fax. I called Apple before my purchase to make sure this was doable - they told me it was. They lied. I'm sure they didn't intend to lie, rather they "assumed" it would work. After talking to AppleCare for about an hour and doing everything but cartwheels, I was told that the Airport Extreme base station's modem port does not support faxing. It supports dial-up. Period. This is ASININE!Tiger (and likely its predecessors) support shared faxing... so, for example, I can have my iMac's modem port connected to the wall and as long as the iMac is on, I can be sitting in the back yard with my iBook and fax wirelessly over my network to my iMac, using the iMac's internal modem... but I can't via the Airport Extreme's modem port. SCREAM!I was already irritated that the USB port only supports wireless printing and I cannot network a drive from that port... but not being able to fax wirelessly is STUPID!The point of having a laptop is that I don't have to be tethered to wires. Whenever I need to fax something I'm working on, I have to run to the nearest phone jack with my iBook and plug it in temporarily and fax that way. There could easily be a feature in the Airport Admin Utility that could block faxes coming from machines with unknown MAC addresses to prevent strangers/neighbors from accessing your phone... just like file sharing - it could be a toggle switch on the service as needed. I do not need to be protected by Apple - if that was even their logic for not enabling faxing over the network.The place I used to work was mostly Windows based and we could fax over the network, not attached to phone lines. If that 2-bit operating system can handle it, why not Apple?!??!The Extreme base station is a work of industrial art - the flying saucer-shaped router is the best looking one on earth (or likely elsewhere). It has the same range (150 foot sphere) of connectivity as the Express. Unless you have to do dialup, the ONLY reason you need an Extreme is if you have more than one computer and one needs to be wired via Ethernet while the other one is wireless - the only reason to spend the extra $70 for the Extreme model. You can use the Extreme as a repeater on existing networks - the Express tends to be picky about what 3rd party routers it will act as a repeater on - basically just other Airport routers and those from Buffalo Networks and that's it.This item loses two stars - one for no wireless faxing and one for no hard drive support via the USB  port. Poor planning on Apple's part. It's a great router and I wouldn't use another brand, but I am extremely irritated w/ the inability to fax.

$REVIEW.: It is not the best product for me because what I was looking for was more protection than anything.  This is not the product for that. It is 2 pieces. 1 pieces is a screen protector which is good.  It is apply wet.  So if you have a problem with applying wet screen protectors, you may want to get something else.  The second piece is a textured cover for the back of the device.  I love the feel of this cover, however protection from damage, I don't think so.  Feels great, and I was amazed by how precise the cutouts were, but protecting your tablet from possible damage, very limited.  I bought another case for that.
$SUMMARY.: I like the feel of this product and the screen protector is good

$review_text.: I've had this for a week or so. Works and sounds great. Excellent value. Has HD scanning and presets. Easy to see the stations that are HD - it displays the station name and the song being played. Both AM and FM Bands. Remote. Easy to hook up to the amplifier. If you use the Harmony remote it is already set up on-line. Only thing I would have liked to see is for it to save the presets if it loses power. But, for $99 you can't have everything. I am going to invest in a better FM antenna to pull in more stations.

So far the battery lasts about 3 hours, the SD card reader works about 40% of the time, and the unit resets when ever it get loaded down. I will be doing a hard reset today to see if during setup I messed up a setting but if it still has issues then back to Amazon it will go as a defective product. Update coming.2.28.11 Update:Finally found a SD card that works, now the issues about very weak battery life - come on 2 to 3 hours on WIFI and a very weak screen???? Turned it on today and I can see a dead pixel. I am really sad about returning this unit, went to BB and played with the Galaxy.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this for a very specific use. I have an iPhone 4 and am holding out stubbornly before upgrading until the iPhone 6. My iPhone 4 is getting very long in the tooth, one of the major problems I'm having is a fairly common problem, the &#34;Home&#34; button is not working well anymore. Sometimes it takes 4 or 5 pushes to even get it to respond. After trying many of the fixes I've found online, nothing worked and the final suggested step was that the button contacts had to be cleaned. I read on a forum that some people had used 98% Isopropyl alcohol but that other had even greater success using a deoxidizing cleaner.I purchased this small tube (and yes this tube is tiny, 2 ML is like a sample you'd get in a model kit or something) and used it on the home button, let it sit for about an hour and much to my shock, the button responded immediately, like new. After struggling with it for so long it's almost hard to believe it's working again. I keep expecting it to start sticking again but it's been a week and so far so good.And just FYI, to &#34;clean&#34; the contacts on the Home button, you don't actually need to open the phone. You just put a few drop around the edges of the button, then I used the back of a pen to just push down around the edges of the button (I did this around 100 times) to let the solution seep into the sides. Apparently, this lets enough solution into the electronics to clean the contacts of the button to make it responsive again.

$REVIEW.: I run long distances on a daily basis and wanted to purchase an armband that would be very unnoticeable (weight wise) on my arm when I was running
 This armband does exactly that


It is very lightweight, easy to put on and strap on, in addition the controls of the Mini are very accessible while I am running


 Also, because the Mini is so light in weight the armband doesn't fall down your arm even when you are completely covered in sweat like I get


 The bonus part about this armband is the little extra Velcro strap that allows you to tuck away the rest of your headphone cords so they aren't jangling all over the place when you run.Overall, it's a great buy! Plus, it's washable!

I have assigned a single IRQ for the card and even from a fresh install there is no luck with this card in Windows 8. I upgraded from windows XP to Windows 8; that should tell you how old the design on this card is. The company has not announced a new driver or plans to work on a driver, that being said, Windows 8 Beta was out for nearly a year before the official release of Windows 8 on October 26th. All in all that is a good sign that the hardware is not updatable for this card. If you are rocking an XP or Vista powered PC and do not have any plans to update, this card may be for you. I have owned this card for 5 years and it looks like it's ready for the dump. I really don't understand why it is being offered on Amazon. This is really a card on its way out and should be sold on Ebay.

$REVIEW.: I don't like regular gps mounts because my dash isn't flat and mounting on my windshield keeps them too far away from me, blocking my vision, and inconvenient to type things in.This solves the issue.It doesn't block my air flow but it brings the gps right up near me from locking securely into my air vent. What I like about this one as opposed to the last one I had is not only does it remove far more easily from my air vent when I wish to do so, but this expands really far to fit my oversized TomTom Via and it also can be turned horizontally or vertically. Read the directions because figuring out how to expand it took me a minute. But once you know how, it's simple.This avoids shaking of my gps which I had in the past but, best of all, it hides the gps from windshield view now that it's lower in my car so that it doesn't hold up a red flag to burglars should you wish to keep it attached rather than mounting and unmounting.I have no negatives...I like that it's made well and expands and contracts should I ever change gps units and it brings the unit closer to my lighter so it can stay charged at all times with no cords from my windshield as well.

$review_text.: I bought a Nook during one of my visits to Tampa, more specifically at the Wiregrass Shops. I must admit that I was tremendously excited when I got the device, because of the reviews and also the SD card capability.My joy was short lived. During the 2 weeks that I owned the product I was never able once to open none of my sideloaded pdf's that I have amassed over the years (over 30GB - I am a voracious reader). A long string of calls to Customer Service and the shop itself ensued, after which I decided to take the trip again (I live outside of the USA) to return the device directly to the store.Much to my surprise, they were extremely receptive at the store and also very apologetic for the device's inability to function properly outside the States and also the lack of functionality and propietary issues. I was refunded for all the items (Nook, cover case and screen protector) in no time at all.So, in summary, the Nook gets a ZERO star in my review for paying more attention to the esthetics rather than the functionality of the reader, but B&N; gets a FIVE star rating for their approachability and for their great costumer service!

$review_text.: I must say that I support 100% what D. Bezboruah said on his review, so my comments will not be a duplicate of what he said.These are by far the best headphones I've ever had.  I travel a lot and tried 3 other kind and brand of headphones hoping to get what I expected when flying on a plane and listen to my music and movies on my iPod Touch.  Well, I first purchased the JBL Ref 610, since I have some issues on carrying cables over me and these are bluetooth which I loved.  The sound was nice, obviously they did not have any noise cancelling feature but I didn't mind then since my intention was to get rid of cables... time passed and changed my mind, I really needed at least a little bit of noise cancelling so I went back to headphones with cable.My second pair were the Audio-Technica ATHANC7 and they were pretty nice for noise cancelling but not so good for sound... I'm a hip-hop music lover so you can guess that I love deep bass and these ones were not good for bass sounds, in addition to have to use batteries. They were bulky as well and took more space within my laptop case than I expected.Then I tried the Bose QuietComfort 15, those were GREAT for noise cancelling when flying (really) and the sound was pretty good, but not great... I also hated the size even that those were smaller than the Audio-Technica's... but I sticked to those for several months without complaints.Then I went to an electronic shop and found the Dr. Dre Studio, tried them on, the sound was amazing but they were bigger than the Bose's, the materials felt not so "strong" and the price was way to expensive for my taste... but when amazon came with these little ones I thought, well, they must sound at least as good as the Studio ones, so I decided to buy them.Now I fly with these little giants, the sound is OUTSTANDING, both high, mids and lows, great bass performance, they DON'T need batteries to work and even that they do not isolate the plane's noise as great as the Bose's, they DO have some nice noise cancelling because of the way they fit on your ears.  I finally get what I expected, great sound, great fit and a nice level noise cancelling without carrying batteries or recharging them with a cable.

$REVIEW.: For what these are, they're well-made. As noted, they do not come with instructions; it's assumed that you know how to install them. If you've never done it before, it might not be obvious how to do it right: strip the wire about 1/4&#34;, push it through the bottom section of the jack, fan out the stripped wire and fold it over the rim of the bottom portion, making sure to spread it out evenly, and then screw the bottom into the pin section until it bottoms out. That will compress the wire into place.Obviously, these will not work with solid wire. They will work best with 14-16AWG stranded copper wire.Now, if you have good speakers, you probably have binding posts that will take banana plugs. Those are a better choice if you have the option. If you're looking for pin plugs, you probably have less-expensive speakers. Generally, on less-expensive speakers, you've got two closely-spaced clamp-type connectors. The problem there is, if you use these connectors, they're likely to touch each other behind the speaker... and thus short out, because the uninsulated metal bodies of these connectors carry the speaker line voltage. You can work around this by using electrical tape or heat-shrink tubing to insulate one or both connectors. Compared to competing pin-type connectors with insulated barrels, this is more work and less attractive.

It operates just as good as my Roku box and have had no lag problems with Netflix or any other movie site. There was quite a lot of movie site choices compared to the unit (different brand) I returned to the retail store because of lagging internet problems. I don't use it for 3D TV but the picture on my HD 1080p TV is excellent for both Netflix and blueray DVD's. When I set the unit up,it was a snap and upgraded the software from Panisonic's site without any problems. I have yet to read anything in the manual. It's that easy. From all the reviews that you see on blueray DVD players with internet capabilities, it always seems to be a crap shoot. So far, I can say that I made a good purchase with this unit.

I've been using a Lowepro Flipside 200 Backpack for my Sony A55, and it is not quite big enough for everything. I just purchased an A99 DSLR and a 70 - 300 mm lens, so needed a bigger bag.  This fits everything perfectly, plus all my filters, batteries etc., with room to spare. There's plenty of room in the top compartment for my phone and misc. stuff. The construction is extremely fine, even luxurious for what it is. Sony's description states that it holds a tripod, but without any details. The good news is, it holds a fairly big tripod securely in the horizontal position, which I prefer to vertically. Finally, I've found my four leaf clover.

$REVIEW.: At first I was worried about paying a premium for this case but in the long run its well worth it. I had the previous version of Sansa (e280) and I had issues with my plastic cases breaking on me as I would constantly drop the device. This leather case solves that issue and it is very durable. The case also has its own screen protector; you just have to clean it once in a while. The other included accessories are an armband for jogging and a carrying case (which I never use). Overall I highly recommend this product as it will easily outlast the plastic cases you may consider buying and that will save you money in the long run. The only issue I had was with one of the sellers on amazon (amazon market place) with this product. The sale price was excellent but they ripped me off with the shipping and that is how they charged me full price for the product; a very dirty tactic as it does not cost $10.00 to ship something of this size. I live in Hawaii and I know for a fact that something of that size costs a couple dollars to send here with USPS so make sure to do your homework guys. Good luck.

$REVIEW.: About a year ago I purchased a blue ray DVD player from a local electronics store and an HDMI cable from Amazon. My setup uses one HDMI cable to connect the DVD player to the TV and a second HDMI cable to connect my cable box to the TV. Everything worked well for about six months. But in recent months playing blue ray DVD's on my TV became a challenge.  When I turned on the DVD player, the TV did not recognize it was connected to the player. I wiggled the connectors and tried different input settings on the TV. After about 20 minutes something usually worked. I looked on-line for solutions and most comments suggested a bad connector in the DVD player. Finally I tried switching the HDMI cables, using the HDMI cable that connects the cable box to the TV for the DVD player.This solved the problem and I realized that the real culprit was the HDMI cable. I purchased a new HDMI cable from Amazon and now the DVD to TV connection works fine. I might add that the broken cable was also from Amazon basics. So, either the first cable was damaged by me or the manufacture lacks adequate quality controls. Anyway I'm now watching and listening to DVD's and CD's without problems and I like my new AmazonBasics HDMI cable.

I have been very impressed with the ease of operation and the quality of the output.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  The screen is a huge help in giving you an idea of where you are, but does not provide a great level of detail.I got this to copy a lot of old tapes from Hi8 and digital cassette type tapes from older camcorders along with moving newly recorded items from my new hard drive camcorder.  This unit has handled them all without any grief.

$REVIEW.: I installed this 500GB drive on my wife's iMac to serve as a Time Machine backup drive

And to that end it has worked perfectly

It was really plug and play.While the USB 2.0 is not as speedy as FireWire, USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt, it is acceptable for her Time Machine backups and other than the initial first backup, has not really slowed the system down in any annoying type way

It is very small and light weight


It is only slightly larger that a deck of playing cards and is actually thinner
She says she doesn't even notice it at all


It is bus powered so there are no extras power cords or wall warts to deal with


Overall it is a very minimalist design that I would be happy with if I was using it with a laptop
That same minimalist design also is serving well with the iMac.My problem with backup hard drives has been longevity

I know i have been thru at least 3 external G-drives on my iMac over the past 5 years
I now even only turn mine on every weekend to backup and then turn it off during the week

Maybe with this one being bus powered it will last longer
I will follow up with this review if it does stop working.Date put into service: 7/1/12

 What you need to be careful is make sure the tripod you will mount it on is just as strong
 If you are using a normal tripod, the extender will out weigh it

$review_text.: My two-year old plus BFG 6800 GT OC failed weeks ago


It went black suddenly while I was playing Neverwinter Nights 2
I had fun with it big time

So I had it returned for BFG (since it had lifetime warranty), and in a few days, they gave me a better model--BFG 7800 GS OC! I am so happy with this.Just note that if you have a card like this, you must have at least 400W power supply (20 amps on the +12V rail at least), and you must accept the fact that it is noisy when it's hot


I was used to this with my 6800 before so no problem
My 550-watter HEC PSU fed the beast
I am so much happier now.

 The Fire fits inside like a glove, no straps on the corners or anything
 The inside front cover is velvety soft to protect the screen

 It folds flat in back or bends into a stand, so we can prop it up in landscape position


 There is an elastic strap that goes around to hold down the front cover.The cover leaves the speakers, power button, USB port exposed, so we don't have to take the Fire out for any reason
 It looks great
 I'm happy with my purchase.

$REVIEW.: UPDATED: 6/20/2012:  WOW
WOW

WOW

 Yes, I repeat myself

 I just love this camera so much
 Images are clean at ISO 1600, and very usable at ISO 3200


 I'm now over 90,000 clicks and couldn't be happier
 I do have on order the new D800, but may cancel that if the new D600 is released before I receive the D800


 This camera (D700) is revolutionary IMHO


 It just works


 It feels good with the larger lenses and my Zuiko battery grip.The images are amazing


 I've printed 30 x 20"  wedding and landscape images that will blow your mind
Super reliable

 Never a glitch, or a hiccup at any events I have shot

 You can't go wrong with this beast.UPDATED: 3/10/2010:WOW


WOW

WOW


Those three words really say it all


 I can't believe how nice this camera has worked
 I love it


 I thought my D300 was great in low light


 Nothing compares to this camera

 I just returned from a trip up north to photograph the Canadian-American Dog Sled Racing Championships and the camera functioned flawlessly in the cold and snow


 I shot over 1900 frames between the dog sled racing teams, and some landscapes
 All I can say is that I'm blown away by the quality.I have been shooting with the Nikon D300 since 2008 and it was stolen in January 2010

 I then ordered two D300s' which I returned and then purchased the D700
 WOW


 I am so happy I did that.The camera is amazing
 Nice weight, and heft


 Even after i took my Zeikos (also purchased here) battery grip from the d300 and attached it to the 700

 Sharpness wise, the D300 and D700 are on par
 However, I have shot many events at high ISO upto 1600 with my D300

 I wish I had had the D700

 The images with the D700 are absolutely amazing whether at lower ISO's or higher.Here is one of my test images shot at ISO 3200:  [...]Also on this blog are "philadelphia Flower Show" pictures that I shot at ISO's up to 3200

 Check them out and you'll see none of the reviewers here are exaggerating when we say it's truly amazng.The downside is I can no longer use my go-to lens the Nikon 18-200VR but I found in one of my boxes of "old"gear a Nikon 28-200AF-D lens that works beautifully, and a 50mm F1.8  For now, these two will do the job for me.

$review_text.: I honestly didn't know this mouse was so tiny, the entire length is only as long as my index finger, so for any average-sized adult hand, it's not really usable for longer durations. This is a great mouse for a child... a SMALL child.I didn't deduct stars for that, it is what it is. But there are a few good things and a few not so good things:PROS:-This mouse truly fires right up and connects without any hassle. That's quite a nice thing because 2.4gHz wireless mice often have connectivity issues. If Microsoft could learn from this and get this technology into their excellentMicrosoft Wireless Mouse 5000, I'd be overjoyed.-This mouse truly does track on most surfaces! My standard Microsoft USB mouse works fine but struggles on my light-colored Ikea desk and also on my black desk matte; this little iHome mouse doesn't, it tracks fine (as fine as it can, more on that in a minute).-The tiny USB transceiver does fit nicely into the bottom of the mouse for easy transport-If you need to travel tiny and light, well then,this mouse will fit that requirement, lol!CONS:-Cheap build. REALLY cheap build, it just feels like a plastic toy.-Mouse Pointer movement on screen is jerky, the resolution of the mouse movement is pretty rough.-Because it's cheap plastic, the mouse click is loud and hollow sounding, and it gets a bit annoying after a while.Bottom line: great mouse for your kid and it connects really well, therefore, 3 stars. Grown-ups should look elsewhere.

$REVIEW.: One of the major problems I've had in the past with wireless mice is interference from outside sources.  This is especially problematic since I work in an automated office with a variety of wireless devices working at the same time.As a result most of my wireless mice will not work properly if the dongle is any more than about 12 inches away.  This has necessitated the placement of the dongle up front and the big, fat versions get in the way (especially when the USB ports are just below the DVD drive, like on my computer).The other problem I've encountered with the big dongle units is that the receiver doesn't fit flush with the mouse when disconnected.  This results in a really bulky mouse that will no longer fit in a computer bag.  This mouse goes one further by fitting inside the unit when you open it.  It sits right next to the battery.This unit has the newer dongle that's about 10% of the old style . The mouse also comes with an on/off switch and, for changing the battery, a slider switch to pop the top off to expose the battery.For a usage standpoint, the mouse works as designed.  I plugged it in without using any software and XP picked up on it immediately.  Although it comes with enhancing software I rarely used any of the features.  I use a mouse to get from point A to B and not much else.The big deal in this unit is the completely silent scroll wheel with the only downside being the clicks are high audible.  A definite contrast in noise generation.Another plus is the rubber siding that makes grabbing it easy.Of course you get side scrolling and a decent menu of options along with the usual cursor and double click speed.Interference was not really noticeable on this mouse, unlike the mouse it replaces that often would get jittery when nearly electronics spooled up.About the only downside I found, and it's really minor, is that the dongle is too small for the front USB ports which are recessed.  Once plugged in the recess was so great I couldn't get my fingers in easily to remove it.  The dongle surface is equal to about half a penny so you can imagine what fat fingered users like me have.The solution?  I plugged it into the rear USB ports (not recessed) and the mouse continued to work as if nothing happened.Good buy, good deal!

$review_text.: Let me start this review by saying that I'm not an &quot;audiophile&quot; and won't be including any gibberish about audible ranges or anything like that. I just can tell when I hear good sound that I like. And these speakers produce that. Plenty of bass (almost too much, I had to turn down the base on my receiver)  and beautifully clear mid-range and high notes.Connected these Bose speakers to my 25 year old Yamaha 500 RX receiver and an old Toshiba DVD player. The system sounds great. In addition to CD and Tuner, I bought a cable that allows me to connect the receiver to my laptop computer, and now I get the best sound I've ever heard from all my Internet radio stations, CD's, ITunes, and games.And best of all, these speakers are small enough that they don't take up hardly any room in my home office. Little cubes are on the side of the room and are not obtrusive. Acoustimass module shoved in the corner.Only really down side I can see is the cost of Bose products.  These are pretty expensive and you can probably find speakers that sound just as good for less money. But, I guarantee you they will not be as small and fit as well in your room.

The banana plug ends were a perfect fit for my Paradigm and Infinity speakers. Also, the plugs mated perfectly to my Pioneer Surround receiver.

All work great in terms of placing the iPad in a comfortable viewing angle and providing protection. I just bought a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 incher and went right to Amazon to get another.

$review_text.: After receiving these and following the directions to the letter (except for the "second" non-existent cord), the speakers had a horrible buzzing sound. We contacted Logitech support who suggested trying them on another device ~ which we did, and which only made the buzzing sound worse.Plus (while looking for a solution to this), we found from the Logitech site that they have major problems with these working with the Vista Operating System, even if they are not defective (we only have Vista on one of our computers, but someone considering purchasing these who uses Vista should be aware of this ~ in fact, ************* would HIGHLY suggest going over the Logitech web site before purchasing these to see what problems people are having with various operating systems and devices). While it is great that so many people have purchased these and like them, they are not a product we personally will be purchasing again. I wasn't expecting Bose-quality sound, however was at least expecting a product which was plug-and-play and that WORKS!However: FIVE STARS ***** FOR AMAZON: This is the first product I have ever had to return to Amazon ~ and after returning other products to other retailers in the past, the "returning" experiance was not something I was looking forward to, frankly. Therefore I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of notifying Amazon that I had received a defective product, then getting a shipping label from Amazon (follow the instructions carefully, not complicated, but do need to be followed) so I could return them at Amazon's expense. I was also pleasantly surprised that Amazon gave me so much time to return them, handy because we have had consecutive blizzards over past weeks and getting out would have been a major hassle had the time-line been more stringent.Amazon does INDEED honor their "30-day" guarantee, they pay for return shipping if you pack it and print the shipping label and place the designated part of the label inside the package. For as many products as we have purchased on Amazon, and after reading so many of the incriminating reviews, I was surprised (number one) that this is the only product so far we have received from Amazon that is un-acceptable and that the Amazon Return Policy is designed for the ease, comfort and convenience of the Customer (and so EXTREMELY easy to use).

$review_text.: Just got the product and set it up in minutes. As long as you give the online setup correct model numbers for all components, you're almost good to go. While it didn't work perfectly at first, the onscreen help on the remote itself fine tuned the settings and I haven't had any issues since.Keep in mind that it only supports five devices so I'm maxed out -- TV, cable box, DVD, receiver, media center PC. But I don't have plans on adding anything soon.One little frustration is that the remote is a state machine so it doesn't like it when you make a change outside of the remote. For example, you will confuse the remote if you manually push the power button on the device itself or if you accidentally hit the power button on the remote, but don't have it pointing towards the devices. You can manually correct things, but it takes a bit more effort.If you're juggling multiple remotes or have family members that can't figure out how to switch between devices, then consider buying a Harmony. I got mine on sale from another retailer. It was $30 for something that cost $100 when it first came out. I'm not sure why someone would need anything more expensive for the basic home TV setup.Update:One more little frustration I'm encountering.  When the batteries run low on the remote, it will go back to the on-screen tutorial periodically.  It's a little annoying when you are settling down to watch TV and you have to push all these buttons in the tutorial before you can turn everything on.  I wish it just had a low-battery indicator.

$REVIEW.: I had to get another laptop after my other macbook broke

Both of my last 2 laptops by Apple broke

They lasted about 2 1/2 years and the way that I use them everyday that is probably about right

The one problem that both seemed to have was the logic board issue
This computer is no where near as fast as I thought it should be
I love the exterior


Apple makes great looking laptops, but I worry that the quality is going somewhat downhill


I have purchased 100s (some through business) of mac products in the last 2 decades and they are just not made like they were 20 years ago.In some ways they are better
The software is certainly better and OS X is the best operating system compared to linux and Windows

I have always had Windows machines in the house too and OS X blows them out in comparison
As an everyday machine this computer is much better than the Mac Mini, which was a laptop processor in a different form.What I loved: I plugged up a firewire to my broken computer and was able to bring everything over to my new macbook in about 2 hours
The battery life is much better


The computer is lighter and appears stronger than the previous two computers out shell.What I did not like: The computer is slighty slow
Apple, why did you change the power supply port and put it on the left


That has to be the worse spot period
There appears to be some connectivity issues with Apple AirPort

I have to reboot a lot
However, I think I should have started with a clean install

My problems may stem from some of the earlier preferences of that computer conflicting with the new system
I will update after that

Otherwise, my problems are with freezes on programs such as safari, and firefox, and slow Office suite
I try not to use Office just because how slow it is on the Mac

My other programs such as word processor Mellel work great

 Conclusion, it could be a reinstall with help
Otherwise, love the exterior, wish the computer were easier to upgrade as it needs more RAM.

So for Asus to say it works on OS X is a blatant lie
Ah I just re-looked at the listing and it has been changed to say &#34;Mac 10.3/10.4/10.5&#34; is supported instead of &#34;Mac OS X.&#34;I tested the ping and data trasfer speeds compared to my built-in wifi in linux and it is very comparable, sometimes out-performing the built-in chip


It seems reliable, but I don't spend a lot of time in linux on this machine.If you have a newer Mac, do not buy this if you are looking for a replacement for your built-in wifi
It won't work.

$REVIEW.: Good replacement for the OEM when the metal key-ring connector fails, and it will.  Our 2003 Golf had both keys fail that way.  Minus 1 star because it didn't include a new gasket - if you can't (and you can't) re-use the old gasket, the electronics are open to water damage

$REVIEW.: I have to agree with some of the other reviews--the case is a bit too large and not what I expected. You could probably fit two, if not even three sets of Koss Portapros in it. I don't very much see cramming a lot of other items into the case, it might damage the headphones. What the case needs is a core that the phones could slip around and would prevent the case from caving in. It's really not that solid or durable. If you put this in a full suitcase or in the bottom of a knapsack it would be easily crushed. This is NOT a true "tortoiseshell" case.  If you're looking for a hard-shell case--look somewhere else. However, if you're comfortable storing your $35 set of Portapros in an over sized Hushpuppy, then this is about as good as you're going to get for the money.
$SUMMARY.: Okay, I guess.

$REVIEW.: I spent 3-4 hours searching on-line and went to a couple stores for the right backpack. I needed it for my 17&#34; Macbook pro and for general use. I paid $42 and could not be happier with this one. Previously I had a swissgear but it was not as good as this one. So I expected quality and was willing to pay a little more for the right item. This has a pocket with plenty of padding for my laptop and yes my 17&#34; fits without a squeeze or bulge. The material is durable and the space is more than adequate. Style points for sure. You could take this camping, to class or on a trip. You can keep looking but unless you want to spend over a $100 you won't even find a comparable backpack.

$review_text.: I bought this, plus the companion XE102, at another web site. I was prepared for troubles, particularly since a got a refurbished set at a bargain price. However, all the setup, including adding WEP security, was accomplished quickly with no fuss - and I'm the kind of guy who attracts trouble when it comes to network configuration. Everything worked the first time. The range is pretty good, too.I gave it just three stars because the throughput is much slower than when I connect instead to my regular Netgear wireless router. Still way faster than dialup, but photos on cnn.com "paint" onto the screen instead of popping onto the screen. Some of this may be due to the fact that my house is about fifty years old and some of the electrical wiring is questionable. Still, I'm pleased to have coverage at the far end of the house without any hassle.

$REVIEW.: I have mixed feelings with this because I'm not exactly sure what the concrete issues are when it comes to it. Let me explain...I wanted to keep my desk clean and free from having 2 large screens etc...so I planned to have my desktop as usual on the desk and then tie in my DVR (security surveillance system) to the same monitor. This type of switch seems ideal for what I need. While the build looks good, it came with a carry bag (little drawstring sack) and the buttons seem sturdy enough, I couldn't help but notice a couple issues after the install.#1 - The most major one was that the resolution of the screen changed between the desktop and the DVR kinda mixed up my desktop's display. All of a sudden the picture seemed &#34;off&#34; almost like when you put your TV into wide mode...some of the desktop was cut off at the edges and not as clear (fuzzy). Like it was a a kind of safe mode. I know for a fact because the shortcut icons I have on the screens borders were halfed. So I went into my settings and had to up the resolution to make the icons appear normal (but slightly smaller) and clear.#2 - my screen saver is usually blank/black so when the monitor goes on standby after shutting the CPU off...it usually goes black and you see the indicator light go from green to yellow telling me it on standby. When it receives a signal then it goes green and the screen lights up with windows whatever...after the install of this switch box, it now shows the no signal/red/green/blue adjust icon floating around as if it maybe receiving some sort of signal still..so now I actually manually shut it off.Just for reference, the security DVR is a Q-See and it happens the same with a Zmodo. The screen is a LCD Flat screen 19&#34; Dell and the desktop is a Compaq Presario. Being that I usually run around with the tablet and spend few hours with the desktop, it doesn't bug me enough to return it and try another. It works, just slightly buggy in those areas but it still serves my purpose. Maybe in the future I may try a different brand/make..I'd actually rate it more like a 2.5 instead of a 3 - it's ok overall but given those slight annoyances I'd still lose another half star. Oh, I also received the unit with blue buttons not grey not that it matters to me. I kinda like the blue anyways.

I turned to the Sony's new PRS-T1 and my wife is most happy,  just reading books.  After the unit was fully charged, I replugged the unit into wife's WIN 7 PC and went into, "My Computer."  There I saw the ereader had G and H drive assigned.  I clicked on the H drive and there was the,  "Install for PC."  It even upgraded the firmware automatically and put the NEW eReader icon on the desktop.  I had 6 new books on wif'e's old PRS-600,  so I went into my eReader history downloaded books and redown loaded the 6 new books onto the new PRS-T1.I found it very simple and FAST, compared to OLD eReader web store.  There are no quirks in using the new eReader and firmware!My wife uses her new PRS-T1 strictly for reading every day and pictures.  She absolutely loves her new Sony reader over the old PRS-600.

Now it runs fast as a new laptop, what a great upgrade!

$review_text.: I really love this remote. I use it with my HTPC and it gives me pretty much all the functions I need. I only ever really need to pull out the keyboard for websurfing to type in addresses that aren't bookmarked. The large button in the middle is to operate the mouse. Its not a touch pad so you have to push it in the direction you want the mouse to move. It works really well but my only gripe is there is a bit of a delay. I think this is an issue with the IR receiver not being very sensitive. In some ways this is a good thing as it keeps the mouse from accelerating too fast. Overall though the quick launch buttons for the web browser, the TV guide, Windows Media Player all work great and are preprogrammed as the remote is certified fro Windows 7 and Vista. I have not tested it with Windows 8.

The weak link on this amazing tablet for me was the charge port

$review_text.: The camera is easy to set up.  Video resolution is ok but not great.  Night mode works well out to about 40 feet.  What separates this from the other monitors is the secure web site that will allow you to see a history of recordings. You can select "events" (sound or motion) to view from anywhere.  I can monitor my home from my iPhone, iPad or any computer. Viewing the web history will cost you about $99 per year for the first camera and $49 per year for subsequent cameras.  If you want to just view from your local wi-fi area there is no charge.  I liked the camera so much that I ordered a second one.

It fits nicely in the Canon supplied recharger and only takes a couple of hours to recharge.  It's rated at twice the mAh of the Canon OEM battery so I have great expectations for it's longevity.  While it's too early to make any definitive statements about the battery I can say that for price it seems a very good deal.  The battery came from the vendor with a couple of free gifts.  A lint free cleaning cloth and a clear plastic overlay which can be trimmed and applied to the camera's lcd screen.  The battery also sports a protective cover for the exposed terminals so storage in a camera bag shouldn't be a problem.  All in all a nice touch.

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a Blu Ray player for my dad, and read the excellent feedback on the Panasonic BDT220 and purchased it. I found it to be fast, and an excellent performer. My only qualms were with the menu system that was very cumbersome and not logical. For example, the default menu selection is for setup, not to play discs. The controller has hard to read buttons, and the Netflix hotkey only works if you are in the "Internet" menu. All of the features, such as Netflix are at least two menus down from the home menu. There is no way Dad could find his way through the menu system.I returned the Panasonic player and bought the Sony BDP-590. It is much slower to fire up and play, but the menu system is much more logical. Plus, the Netflix button actually works no matter what the current mode is. Function won out over performance.

The cost to benefit ratio wasn't where I wanted it to be.  I used a Kill-o-watt to measure my computer's usage and this was overkill for a PC with a 1,000 watt power supply.  This unit has ok build qualities and would probably work best in a commercial setting where demands can fluctuate rapidly.  It does come with a 20amp to 15amp plug adapter which I'd say isn't safe to use unless you KNOW you will never exceed 15amp draws.

$REVIEW.: When I was looking for a new pair of headphones a few months ago I tried out quite a few before buying these. The headphones are terrific; great sound with some bass amplification but not to the point where it is obtrusive. The earcups feel comfortable and I can wear them for reasonably long periods. They come with a carry case and an accessory jack. Haven't really tried the iPhone function too much as I usually use the headphones with my laptop or iPod. The volume function works on the Macbook. I'm quite thrilled with this purchase; my only quibble is with the padding on the earcups. It came off on one side and replacing it was a nightmare. There is a video on the Klipsch website that shows you how to do it but it didn't make it any easier for us. You really need quite a bit of dexterity to pull it off. Aside from that, however, these headphones are great. Would definitely recommend them.

I gave the product 1 star but I give the vendor 5 stars for his fast service with this problem.

$review_text.: I've purchased a couple of these over the years. They work as expected. Haven't lasted a real long time, but I attribute that partly to my son's rough handling when plugging and unplugging. Where I've had these fail is where it plugs into the laptop. Again, I think that's more of a proper handling issue, and not a complaint about the device itself. For the price I really couldn't complain anyway. All of these seem to have cords that would benefit if they were a bit longer.

$review_text.: My biggest overall complaint with this product is that what you get isn't exactly what's shown in the pictures. First of all the item doesn't have button covers as shown. What you get is simply a case that has holes cut out where the buttons are. This doesn't sound like a big deal, but I found that it's actually the biggest deal breaker. The 6th gen. nano volume and sleep/power buttons aren't exactly the easiest things to push down. With the case on it makes it that much harder to push these buttons down. I found that when I'm out walking that I have to un-clip the Nano from my clothes and use both hands to adjust volume. It's not a huge deal, but something as simple as button covers would allow you to adjust the volume with one hand without having to re-adjust the nano and everything. The second issue is with the picture showing the back of the iPod nano. The picture makes it look like you get some sort of cover/protector for the clip of your nano since there is not a black nano and the picture makes it look like you get a protector/cover that matches the case. This was not the case and the clip just slips through an open slot on the back, which prevents the clip from opening very much. This can be a problem depending on what you're wearing. The third issue involves the bottom of the nano. In the picture there's a little rubber strip that separates the audio jack from the pin connector; There is not. It's basically just an open bottom. Also, the case doesn't fit perfectly around the screen as shown. The bottom piece rests on the actual screen while the rest fits perfectly around the screen. I've tried readjusting the bottom piece and the case itself, but nothing fixes the issue.The only thing I like about this product is that it's silicone and it's cheap. I did complain to the seller and they gave me a partial refund. I guess you can't complain too much for the price, but it's really irritating when you don't get exactly what's shown.

I use it every day & drive at least 20k per year for work.Additionally, I fly at least once per month & take it with me.The dash mount and additional charger/speaker is perfect.Occasionally it locks up & there are some cases where it can't find things, but it's always spot on for directions.When I drive with others who know the area, they're always surprised if it takes us on a different route, but never disappointed- it is usually faster or at least more direct (even if it pulls you off a highway & through town- which can save significant time).I use all the features except waterways and believe each one to be worth having. Especially the "all points of interest".They even sent out a free updated CD for me this past year & when I broke the car charger they mailed out a free one (it was my fault that it broke).I can't say enough good things about Garmin, the product & service.

Camera is good if the light is strong, and the video works ok, although I did have to color-correct the video afterwards.  Still, I was able to film whale sharks up close while swimming alongside them, and if you stay very shallow in clear water (less than 10 feet), you'll get satisfactory results.  About all you can expect from a camera in this price range.

It doesn't have the power for large rooms or large speakers, but for an office, bedroom, etc it is a fine choice


Sound quality is quite good
I don't see where the &#34;2013 Upgraded Model&#34; is any different than the standard model, so I would suggest saving the difference and buying the standard model now that they have replaced the terrible power supplies the earlier ones hadI have 3 of these (all but one the standard model) in various applications and they all work great

$review_text.: Bought the 2 pack of these from Costco.  Placed one in the Canon SD950 to take pics of my newborn.  360 pics were taken over the 1st 2 days of my baby's life with a fully charged camera with a lot of battery to go.  On the 3rd day, there was only 1 pic on the card!  The other 359 were corrupted!  Never used the card in any other device and never took the card in or out.  I tried reading it in 5 other devices to find that the space is taken, but the pics are gone.Called Canon, where a very helpful rep (I had other Canon products with which he was helping me).  I asked if I should stay away from Sandisk as a whole and he said that i should stick with big reputable companies like Sandisk (and Kingston or Lexar...can't remember which he said).  He said to make sure to format the card first (which i didn't do in this case), make sure the battery never runs out while taking pics, never pull the card from a reader while it's running...common sense stuff.  He did say that most card companies will give a program which will restore files.So, I called Sandisk.  I got a rep who was very difficult to understand because of a thick foreign accent and a delay in talking transmission which leads me to believe that the CS for Sandisk is overseas...namely India.  She was useless.  She directed me to a website to recover files... [...]  I was told to download the demo and see if I could see any files and then I would have to purchase the demo on my own.Ok...well, then since I had a card which failed once, i wanted a new card to replace this...she should pretended she didn't hear me... I repeated and she then was clearly trying to get me off the phone. I don't have time to waste on the phone as a newborn is screaming in the other room...so thank you, goodbye.I did proceed to try their recovery program demo. It could identify 2 and a half pics.  Worthless.Then I downloaded eIMAGE Recovery which could identify all 360 pics... but only 2/3 of them were viewable and all the videos were screwed.  I bought that program since I could recover some key photos.All in all...as another poster states...I should go with the better SD card than this whether it be the Ultra III or another brand...but now I have to find the packaging for Costco and return these.BTW, I did end up using the other 2g card in the pack for the past few weeks after formatting it and it hasn't yet failed.To all...make sure you download pics to your computer often! Especially if you have a special occasion!

With last months purchase of a new flash-based camcorder, I finally moved into the world of SD and microSD cards. Compared to tapes which need to be rewinded and handled with extreme care, SD cards is in it's own world in terms of convience and storage.This Transcend model 8GB has worked perfectly this past month. Everything recorded is stored properly by this SD card. Once I am done with my recording I transfer the footage to my hard-drive and the SD card is free and open for a new round of recordings. 8GB gives about 2 hrs recording time for my camcorder at the highest setting, just right. This is a great item.

$review_text.: I've had my Canon G1X for a month now including a week long vacation where I shot it at least 500 times. I'm now confident in expressing my impressions about this camera. I own cameras in nearly every usage category including full-format DLSR, APS-C DSLR, mirrorless, super zoom, travel zoom, premium compact, waterproof, and iPhone. I change at least one of my cameras every 3 months just so I can try out interesting new devices like this G1X. I sought out this particular camera to replace my need for APS-C cameras entirely by having a large sensor, compact size, and view finder. Yes, the viewfinder made my short list because I've gotten used to shooting DSLR style for the stability and speed. I didn't mind the fixed lens of the G1X because my lens collection is built around my FF DSLR and I typically use APS-C only with a single all-purpose lens. I've also been disappointed in the compactness of most other mirrorless systems because of the large protruding lenses. I feel that if the camera can't really fit in your pocket, then it might as well be a small DSLR rather than a camera with performance compromises. This Canon met my expectations for compactness and still provided a 4x retractable zoom lens. I've tried the Lumix 4/3 combos with their 3x power zoom and I don't think the image quality was as good as this G1X although Lumix had better viewfinder options. Moreover, the Lumix body-viewfinder-lens combos were $300 to $500 more than this Canon. Anyhow, this Canon met my image quality expectations and is ergonomically a great all-in-one vacation camera/video recorder. However, I'm disappointed with its performance in a few areas. AF speed is poor so you suffer from shutter lag on the delay between pressing and the picture actually being taken. The shot to shot recovery time is also terrible so you can't fire multiple frames at a baby in hopes of finally catching the perfect smile. Moreover, my iPhone and Sony cameras have trained me to believe that HDR is a must-have feature. My Nikon SLRs rely on bracketing and don't have HDR, and I've never been happy about it. So I was psyched to see that this Canon had built-in HDR in addition to bracketing but disappointed to use it. It requires a tripod and nothing in the scene to be moving. That really cuts down on its usefulness. I tried shooting multiple times in daylight with as steady a grip as I could muster but the HDR still blurred the 2 frames during the merge. I had to plant the camera on a stationery object and use the delay timer to finally get a perfect shot. Something I've been taking for granted on all of my Sonys (NEX and HXv models). Another flunk was the macro mode. Whether you induce macro by focusing close in AUTO mode or deliberately set the macro mode, it can hardly focus on close objects. This lens just wasn't cut out for close objects. I don't think it's even possible after a lot of trying, so I had to backup, zoom in, and shoot multiple times through the fussy focus hunting to grab a sharp shot. Again, this is something I take for granted on my iPhone or compacts. The optical viewfinder is reliable, mimics the zoom, and convenient but it has parallax error and doesn't display any shooting data like an SLR would. The live viewfinders on the NEX7, Fuji and Lumix models definitely win this battle. My final flunk is of small consequence and that is the panorama mode. It's an unusuable joke on this camera. The Sony iSweep Panorama is night and day superior to this stitch-assist piece of junk. Having said that, I let the issue go since I usually stitch panos with more sophisticated post processing software unless the scene has moving subjects. If moving, then the Sony built-in mode is awesome. Although I ran off a list of complaints, my list of praises is actually longer but easier summarized by just saying the image quality is good, ergonomics are good, and the G1X has a long list of functions. In summary, I will keep this camera as my HiQ vacation camera until Sony updates the NEX line to include a full tilt-swivel screen and retractable zoom lens that is sharp.
$review_summary.: Falls short of expectations but still the best that I can find for now

$review_text.: It's a nice cable replacement for my Sennheiser HD 598 headphones. However, the 3.5mm end of it is very slightly shorter than a standard 3.5mm plug, so it keeps slipping out of my iPhone jack. I compared it to several other 3.5mm plugs and it's indeed shorter, the difference is very small but enough to cause problems of not locking in all the way when plugging into certain headphone jacks.Edit: After another few weeks, the problem lies in the actual 3.5mm pin part of the plug. It tends to move, making it become shorter the more I use it. I used a pair of plyers to pull it out more so it's longer, but after a few days it seems to shorten again from all the plugging in. I don't think I take it apart without breaking it. I might try a little crazy glue to keep the plug in place. I really want to like this cable, as its the perfect size for my HD 598's, however this problem is really annoying.

$REVIEW.: I ordered these with very high expectations after reading all the glowing reviews.  I am not an audiophile, and currently play 360 games through a pair of $20 headphones I got from new egg a few years ago.That said, the sound on these headphones was very low quality.  I played COD 4 with them and the sound quality was mediocre in terms of the "surround" effect, but what really killed it for me was the complete lack of bass.  There is a "subwoofer" that vibrates, but it actually offers almost no actual bass.  What you are left with is an extremely tinny sound that hurts your ears.  I really wanted to like these, but I ended up taking them off because pure treble with no offsetting bass response was simply too painful to my ears.  If you play games with shooting, explosions, etc., that really need a decent bass response, these are not a good solution.  I was expecting something in the bass department similar to the HP Aopen 590 headphones that I use now (discontinued BTW), but to be clear, the bass in these headphones isn't just light, it is almost non-existent.  So, I have sent them back and am awaiting my refund from Amazon.

However, this might be due to my v2.1 BT dongle.-The Logitech dongle works, but it is not one of their newer Unify dongles, so it needs its own USB slot.-The headset will not sync after waking my PC from sleep mode until I unplug and re-insert the dongle.Overall I'm satisfied with this headset and don't regret the purchase, but if you're running Windows 8 and wish to use this headset via Bluetooth you will want to look elsewhere.

$review_text.: The one problem with the Apple magnetic cover for the iPad is that it does not protect the back of the iPad
 This accessory remedies this omission
 It fits perfectly onto the iPad, and fits together flawlessly with the iPad cover

 It fits perfectly over the camera holes and the other connection ports, and simply complements the Apple cover to perfection.The ergonomics of this unit are good
 It maintains the thin characteristic of the iPad, i.e

it does not add much in the way of bulk to it
 Plus, the feel of this backing is quite pleasant


 It is a soft but firm rubberized feel that is nice to the touch.A simple but necessary accessory if you use the Apple iPad front cover


 Recommended

 RJB.


$SUMMARY.: If you use the Apple cover, you need this!

$review_text.: I've been using Belkin's products (routers and adapters) for a LONG time.  Their products are so simple to use and they are engineered to meet with customer needs.  They are simple and you do not need to read through a massive booklet to figure out the advantages/disadvantages of the product.  It's pretty much a simple plug & play concept.  I've worked with other companies products before and was always upset at how much time they took to set up--you won't get that with a Belkin.  Also, they come with a 2-year limited warranty from Belkin themselves.I wish you the Best.RL M

$REVIEW.: Since they first became available I have used ViewSonic monitors for work and at home


I like the brand.This monitor is bright and has great color depth even at the close range when used with a computer

It is incredibly flat and event he base takes up little space

Tall or short people can adjust the tilt although it is a little tight (at least it stays where you put it!)


AFter a couple months I can find nothing to complain about

I'm using it with a Macintosh Pro and my wife has the next size down to use with her Macbook Pro.Both were simply plug and go.Oh, and I have had a couple other flat panel monitors and all three had a few bad pixels out of the box


This has 100% working pixels.

The price is high, but then again we spend a lot of money on Nikon gear, and the D7000 isn't cheap by itself.2. They should have built the grip into the D7000.Otherwise, this is a fantastic item and I really wish I had it from day one. My photos would have been much better.

$review_text.: Maybe I received a lemon, but the box had no power cable to connect to an IDE drive


The data cable was oriented 180 degrees off

If you flip your drive over so you could plug in the cable, it is offset far enough that it can't fit in the bracket

Also because you had to flip the drive over, there is no way to use the fasteners included to secure the drive to the bracket because the screw holes on your drive now face up
 I have three IDE drives that I wanted to recover data from and they all don't work with this case.The case is nice and compact

Maybe with the right cables would have been a great product.

Had all the buttons for media player and the such. I realy love the calculator button. I also liked the keyboard and the wireless aspect of everything, but, and theres always a but. I tried to use the mouse setting about 15 away with no wall between me and the USB and it was very jerky. I had to plug my USB into an extension and now have it hanging from the top of the door with no problem. Also, the key stroke on the keyboard is deep and not loud at all. Can't say that for the mouse though, sounds like someone is popping bubble wrap when you click it. It would be lower stars but with a small child in house not having wires for her to pull on is great.

The volume is great, if not too loud.  The alarm clock works well and the audio quality is adequate.My home is on the fringe of coverage so the signal is not perfect.  However, you can build or buy external antennas.  NOAA even has links on their site for how to do so.I built our with the plans at this link:[...]The alerts work well and I like how granular the options are.Since ordering these, I have now ordered 6 more for people I work with and family members.

$REVIEW.: Clamcase for Ipad2 arrived yesterday, from previous reviews it worked right out of the box.  I turned the bluetooth on ipad2 and Clamcase.. nothing... nada.. no light goes on... And yes, I held down the bluetooth button for more than 5 seconds more like 1 minute! I charged it overnight, woke up this morning and orange light is still orange (bad sign)I think a fully charged unit has a green light.  I checked bluetooth connection again and even tried to reset the clamcase with paperclip (per the instructions).. I guess they sent me a dead one. The only good news is how easy it is to return to Amazon.  The one question that I did have for those who purchased this Clamcase is how does the sleep mode work when you close it? I noticed a gap between the ipad and clamcase when closed, how would the magnetic feature work if it is not touching? I think I am going to pass on ordering another one, not a very good feeling about this product when you drop $149 and get a defective unit.

$review_text.: Between our two kids, our Wii, and our XBox, we have a lot of items in our house that require batteries.  In the interest of being as eco-friendly as possible, as well as saving money, Eneloop batteries have become the only rechargeables that we'll buy.This is because they are high-quality and their convenience is unsurpassed.  By buying some adapter sleeves, these batteries fit not only devices that take AA batteries, but can be adapted to fit devices that take D batteries.  When our son was young and using items like his baby swing on a regular basis, we found this to be invaluable.  We have so few devices that require D batteries, but tons that require AA batteries, that it was fantastic to be able to buy just AA's and have them work in everything.  This was far, far more practical than having to buy a couple of sets of rechargeable D batteries, which would have been useless to us in short order.We've used these batteries in everything from the aforementioned baby swing to game controllers to my wireless computer mouse, and have always found them to hold a charge really well and to last for a good, long time.  They also charge pretty quickly, and the charger units are very convenient because the plug folds into the back, making them easy to store.  I recommend the Eneloop system to everyone I know.  Kudos to Sanyo for developing a product that is excellent quality and has such a high level of convenience and practicality.

$REVIEW.: I have been using theLogitech Cordless Desktop Wave Setfor my desktop computer for a year and think it's the best keyboard and mouse I've ever used

I tried this MK 300 with my Toshiba Satellite laptop (running 32-bit Vista) and am very impressed.I unpacked the box, plugged the receiver into my laptop's USB port, and the MK 300's mouse and keyboard worked immediately
When I installed the Setpoint software from the CD-ROM and rebooted the laptop, all the function keys worked beautifully to bring up the various Microsoft Office programs, Windows search, Windows functions (save, undo, redo), and so forth.The USB receiver is larger than the Wave's, and the keyboard and mouse are much more compact

The mouse lacks the convenience buttons on either side that navigate forward and backward in Web pages, and the keyboard does not have the palm rest and ergonomic design of the Wave's


But the mouse and keyboard are both comfortable and as responsive as the Wave's.If you are looking for a compact wireless desktop set for your Windows computer (not compatible with Mac OS) at a bargain price, I would definitely recommend the MK 300.

The display is B/W LCD, not LED, so it does not self light, if its night you need to turn on a light to see the display. The unit has a small leg prop feature to cant the display roward the viewer.  Fine if you have it on a desk/table that is level with the viewer.  Mine is on top of an older style roll top desk and that put it too high to see without standing up.

$review_text.: This Ultimate Ears MINI is just that a small speaker slightly larger than the width of my hand and about the size of a fist
 The main difference is that is does not have to be attached to a wrist since it can and does work wirelessly through Bluetooth

 Way back in the dark ages (before the internet and even surround sound among many other enlightments to our hearing experiences) I bought The 1812 Overture and the salesman (today he might be called Audio Technician) warned me to NOT play this CD above certain levels because near the end of the Overture the speakers could get blown out
 I believed him and have yet to blow out one speaker

 I have been playing the 1812 through the MINI and the sound output is considerably full and fairly accurate based on my hearing capacity
 It picks up the trumpets and the French horns with clarity and produces deceptive sounds


 I normally listen to the 1812 through a SACD player and there is a significant difference between 5.1 SACD and a single speaker of minimal size but the MINI is surprisingly good
 I did not increase the volume setting too high and did not experience a speaker blow out either; however, the strong bass mainly generated by the cannon fire, timpani and bass drum could easily awake a heavy sleeper

 A whold gang of words for saying this single speaker has superior output.The Bluetooth works perfectly with several devices

 I paired it with a regular cell phone, a Note II, a Dell laptop, a Toshiba notebook and a Smart TV with ease and stability
 The speakerphone capability is on par with far more expensive devices and well worth a consideration

 The rubberized outer shell basically eliminates a need for non-slip feet since that rubber skin has a great coefficent of resistance and does not slip much or non depending on the surface
 The metal front and back grills suggest a high level of resistance to damage from bouncing around the cab of a vehicle or other place where it might get tossed around


 I would suggest one simple change (simple to me, that is) and that is, if possible, make one end of the oval flat so that the user could set the MINI on a flat surface in a verticle orientation instead of the somewhat mandatory horizontal placement.A great speaker (actually two inside that little box) at a reasonable price for almost any use and almost anywhere that lasts far longer than most battery powered units.

$REVIEW.: I have bought JLabs, Monster, and other brands like Skull Candy. I hate to say it, but no one can make a product that lasts as long as Sony does. If you just want some cheap headphones that won't last you that long then buy elsewhere, but these are a decent price and you get more out of these than other brands. Monster, Beats, and all those other brands are overpriced pieces of plastic. These are much more comfortable and give you more for your money.

$review_text.: When one finds the iPod line hasn't changed much in a while, just wait a few days, and you are likely to be blown off your feat. Apple is constantly innovating, and pushing the limit, in order to bring you the world's greatest products.Size - I did not even fully comprehend how impressed I would be, when I held the Nano in my hands. The iPod Nano's size is its greatest attribute. Its depth is slightly less than a number two pencil. In fact, the iPod Nano is thinner than the iPod Shuffle. Of course, it is also significantly less wide and tall, than the original iPods, and the iPod Mini it replaces. The iPod Nano is almost four times lighter than the iPod Photo 20 Gigabyte player.It seems and feels even smaller in person, but everything fits together beautifully as well. The seems around the edges are very neat and nearly impossible to notice. When holding the iPod Nano, you really get the feeling that you are holding something of appreciable quality.Reliability - The iPod Nano will prove to be incredibly reliable. Why? The Nano uses solid-state flash memory, which means there are no moving parts, in the player. The original iPod and iPod Mini used miniature hard drives, while still a good solution, they were bigger and could become damaged, when taking a hit. A lot of people who were upset that their iPod with a hard drive went out, would likely not have any problems, with the iPod Nano.Storage - This is the new 1 GB version of the iPod Nano.  Apple released the 1 GB version, to have an entry-level nano priced at only $150.  You get all the features of the 2 & 4 GB models, but simply less storage for songs.  If having less songs to carry around is ok with you, save some money with this player.Display - The display on the new iPod Nano is fantastic. It features a nice resolution, and color. You can view your photographs, or the album art, from your music. There are also the standard iPod games to play, in color.Click Wheel - The click wheel continues to make iPod the most convenient and easy-to-use music player around. Being used to the slightly larger click wheel, on the full size iPod, I was concerned the Nano's smaller click-wheel would be less functional, but that concern was quickly dismissed, when I saw it works as easy and efficiently as ever.Battery Life - Battery life is always an important feature. After all, what good is it having 1000 songs in your pocket, if you can't listen to them? The iPod Nano lasts 14 hours, on a single charge, under ideal conditions. Ideal conditions are allowing the playing to play on its own, without accessing menus regularly, which turns on the backlight and drains the battery. Even with regular fiddling, you should last well over ten hours.Overall, Apple truly hit a home run, with the iPod Nano. Some companies follow, and some companies innovate and change the world. Apple is one of those companies. I love the nano, and my music can no go with me to even more places, with a player that is lighter than ever. The iPod Nano is destined to become the best selling music player in the world, and it will be for good reason.

$REVIEW.: That's how many separate pockets/partitions I counted
Laptop and tablet-friendly or not, I can tell a good backpack when I see one and this is a darn good backpack


And it is so because...* It's made of what appear to be good quality materials, both inside and out.* Padded where it counts

There is nice padding on the side that comes in contact with the back

There is heavy padding on the shoulder straps as well and there's more inside to keep a laptop and tablet as safe as reasonably possible.* Lots of pockets and partitions, from water bottle to laptop and tablet and anything in between plus pencil holders and so on.* Smooth-sliding zippers make it very easy to get your things in and to get to them quickly when you need them.* Comfortable to wear due to padding and a great back-fitting design.From the official specs:- Exterior dimensions: 12.50" x 7.25" x 18.00" (looks bigger)- Interior dimensions: 11.33" x 1.65" x 16.15" (have no idea what the 1.65" measurement is for)- Material: Polyester- Laptop max size supported: 17.3" (that's the screen diagonal)- Tablets supported: 1st and 2nd gen iPads, most tablets and e-readers up to 10" (had no problem with a 10.1" tablet)If you're looking for an all-black, all-business, good quality backpack to carry things (including laptop and tablet gear) around to work or school, this one would be quite an excellent choice.

$review_text.: I bought this a few weeks ago,after trying to decide between a digital SLR,or a super-zoom digital camera. I almost got both in this camera.The Leica lens is superb. The anti-shake function works beautifully. The zoom renders crystal clear photos. The close-up lens set,and the WA lens I bought with it are exactly suited to the camera.The LCD viewer is large,crisp,and bright.Some have said the camera is "heavy." I say so what?? It has an excellent feel and heft to it,and I like that.It's substantial.Plus,there are about 14,000 functions on the camera.All easily understood/explained.Lots of tweaking available for those of us who like hands-on photography.I have a very nice little 5.1 mp Nikon which I will use for my point-and-shoot photos,even though it also renders wonderful photos on its own merit.When paired with a good photo program(I use Corel,Adobe and Microsoft),you can spend hours playing with the photos,and I guarantee you will be very pleased with what you create.Get a good printer!!!!!

$REVIEW.: I bought a JVC Everio GZ-MG155 about one year ago, and was never completely satisfied with the image quality, it was not as sharp as I expected. I decided to give a try with the Canon FS100 since all my digital still cameras had been Canon and I loved the images and colors they produce.Well, thanks to the Canon FS100 I realized my JVC Everio was not in fact that bad at all...I recorded some scenes with both cameras and edited them back to back in a DVD, so I could see the footage in my 50'' high definition TV and could compare results.Outdoors, in sunshine, both camcorders performed more or less the same, same image sharpness, colors, etc. No big difference at all.Indoors the difference was simply amazing; the Canon FS100 produced grainy images full of noise (annoying red particles around everywhere) in most lighting situations. Just to clarify this point, I'm not talking about recording in low light, I'm talking about regular indoor lighting (in low light the results were even worse). When I saw the recorded footage in my 50'' TV, the amount of image noise and pixelized artifacts was unbearable.On the contrary, my JVC, does not produce any noise, not even in low light (yes, the image is much darker in low light, however, no noise or red particles floating at all).I tried the manual controls of the Canon over the weekend (since the camera is so tiny and portable that I really wanted to like it), however I couldn't get any good results indoors compared to the JVC. And another issue also quite annoying; while the JVC stores all the manual settings when you turn the camera off, the Canon erases all the manual settings. This means every time you turn on the camera in manual mode, you need to reset the settings.Finally, I just decided to stick to my JVC and returned the Canon FS100 to Amazon (which by the way, is great; they gave me a full refund on the camcorder).

$review_text.: One handy little security camera.  Its instructions (written and on disk in PDF) are nice but forget to mention all the useful record option settings under the poorly named "monitor tab" (last button in security option menu) that let you go to a higher resolution and change other record settings.The instructions go on and on how to use this device to play back music and other odd options not logical in a stealth camera/clock.  For several reasons it may be best to ignore those options as if they did not exist.As a "put it in a good spot and forget it" camera (that looks like a well built travel alarm clock) this is a pretty dam good device!!  If on motion detect its videos are easier to sort through. I keep it aimed at a well lit foyer entrance door area (microphone off) to avoid I spy action in the living room. It happens to be a handy spot for an easy to see clock.  However when away its good for areas that should be empty of busybody people and dogs who should not be on the couch.  When I suspected someone of going through a high kitchen cabinet where I keep pills, this camera proved they did just that before they reached up to find a loaded mousetrap (and no pills) on a return trip.I like this camera so I would recommend it for home or office. Video quality is nothing to get excited about... Its MP4 recordings are very good in good light, not to bad in low light, limited in the dark (but better if you have some extra infra red light or motion activated room light available). With a 32 gig SD card you can record for a week or so.  Overall its very useful but some trial and error is required.  I found the camera needs to be tipped up or down to avoid it missing what you want to see, small lights in front of the camera can be a problem at night.  Besides working for hours on battery the battery keeps its settings if you have to unplug and move it.  Good luck reviewing video on its small screen, the USB to computer interface works well and to me is the only logical viewing option.  For sure it needs a longer USB cable, it comes with a very short white one and an annoying power pack with an overly bright red power light. Easy items to replace. BTW the lights on the clock base seem to be its night lights. I had other light available (LED night lights and motion detect room lights) so I covered the base with black tape.  I also blanked the display (esc button) since it makes the unit run cooler.

$review_text.: First of all, let me say this... I can't believe this camera has earned 136 5-Star reviews and 49 4-Star reviews. Also, I can't believe they are charging $250 for this piece of junk. I've had my camera for about 2 years.  I bought it to replace a Kodak Easy Share, which took awesome pics but had a serious battery problem.  This Sony takes great pics outdoors with lots of natural light.  Indoors is an entirely different story.  Lag time is excessive.  Blur is a common problem and many precious moments are lost due to this.  Many pics come out yellow AND blurry.  This is supposed to be a point-and-shoot camera.  There may be settings you can tweak to alleviate these issues, but if I wanted a manual camera, I would have bought one!  The battery life is way too short, therefore I had to purchase an additional battery for a back-up, so I would always have one fully charged and ready to go.  I don't like the memory stick... I prefer an SD card.  Like I said, I've had this camera for about 2 years and stopped taking pics for awhile because they were so crappy.  FINALLY, I broke down and bought a Nikon Coolpix S3000 12.0MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom Electronic Vibration Reduction (VR) and 2.7-Inch LCD for $110 and LOVE it. It has fast ISO of 3200, which is great for low-light and moving objects.  I wish I would have done myself a favor and upgraded the Sony much sooner.
$SUMMARY.: Not a good camera!

$review_text.: I installed the drive in a few minutes in my HP laptop, then took a few hours to reinstall Windows 7 and all my programs


This went without a hitch and was actually fairly quick (I have lots of programs!)

Once I had restarted my computer a few times, the boot up time had dropped significantly, from around 2.5 minutes with my old hard drive to around 45 seconds with the Momentus XT
As the drive &#34;learned&#34; which programs I used frequently, program loading times definitely became shorter, especially for Firefox and Lightroom

My computer has been rejuvenated by this drive
I would even consider installing one in my desktop.The price is high for a 750GB drive, but in my opinion it is worth spending extra for the performance increase.Highly recommended.

$review_text.: I have tried everything to avoid false alarms, but it seems to me that this item needs to look across a perfectly barren expanse to work. I have a few 10-ish-foot-tall trees on both sides of my drive within about 30 feet of the pavement, and every time it's windy at all, as well as occasionally when it's not, the sensor activates falsely. The only thing moving in its view when it goes off is tree limbs 45 or so feet away. Narrowing the sensor's field with tape to less than ten percent open resulted in no alarm when needed, while about 15% open still gets lots of false alarms. I have tried many different positions and apertures with no better results. Upon thinking about it more, it seems obvious that a motion sensor is going to go off if anything nearby is moving, so any trees it its view would spoil its efficacy. I give it two stars because it does go off when somebody goes by it, but even a few false alarms every hour is too many. Doesn't anybody make an electric-eye type of driveway sensor? Why not? My garage-door's electric-eye stopper works great.

$REVIEW.: I bought this camera specifically for a trip I am taking for 6 days to Tokyo during Thanksgiving week. I have not gone on the trip yet, but have used the camera extensively to get used to it, etc. I read some of the negative reviews on here and not one of them have been true to me. I have had absolutely NO problem hooking the camera up to my computer for one. It's extremely easy to get my pictures off the camera.Second, the lens cap issue is not an issue. If you leave the cap on and turn on the camera, it simply flashes a white screen saying &#34;lens error.&#34; All you have to do is turn it back off, take the lens cap off, turn it back on and you're good to go. I haven't had any grunting noises or trouble or anything and I have forgotten the lens cap on a few times.I DO struggle to get clear pictures when lots of movement is involved although I'm still playing with the settings. I don't think the blurriness is a problem of the camera so much as it is the settings or the user.This is the PERFECT camera for people who are not professionals but want some good looking pictures. The zoom is amazing and the focus is as well. I find it very user friendly for people who know their way around a point and shoot camera. If you don't know your way around cameras, there is an auto option.

$REVIEW.: I researched online for awhile and the Creative Vision M is the best video/mp3 player because its screen is superior and the Vision M can easily play (without further conversion/encoding) many video formats.So after almost two months using my Vision M here's what I got to say:In my experience, it plays just about any P2P video file I download (only two instances where I had to use the creative software to encode to a proper format). So far the most fun I have had with my Vision M is being able to transfer all the TV shows I download to my player in a matter of minutes -- then hook up the AV cable and I can watch them in great quality (every bit as good as the computer) from the comfort of my TV.Of course, the Vision M is also a MP3 player and I have taken the time to transfer my entire music collection to my player. Using an FM transmitter, I can use the "random play all" mode to listen to nothing but my favorite songs when I'm driving. Sound quality is very nice too.And then there is even more features - photos, FM radio, Microphone, Organizer, Removable Disk space and 30 GB of space!! This is a great player!! Is $300 a bit pricey? Yes. But if you can find a deal on it (my goal was $250 and I got extremely lucky and got it at $220 (USED)) - you won't be disappointed.PLUS IF YOU DO GET ONE -- buy a "Best Skin Ever", "Invisible Shield", or a simple LCD Screen Cover to keep the player from getting any serious scratches (Although most of the time, unless I'm in harsh lighting I never noticed scratches on my player).

$review_text.: See the reviews for the 1000W unit

These have a nasty tendency to die early

Failure mode is intermittent shut-off


Just exactly what you're trying to prevent


I have two of them, and one just decided to switch itself off whenever it felt like it


The factory offered me a 20% discount to buy another one


NO repair option - - these are throwaway units.I can understand a battery going out or a circuit failing, but an intermittent shutdown is not acceptable, nor is the no-warranty, no-repair, thank you sir I'll have another attitude


TrippLite has lost my business.UPDATE: my second unit has now failed, making for 100% failure rate within 2 years


Failure symptom is the same - it just shuts itself off without warning

Both of the units I bought are completely useless, totally defeating the purpose of a UPS


I could understand the failure mode being less and less battery life during backup - - but this total shutdown is totally unacceptable.



$SUMMARY.: Watch Out !!! early deaths & no warranty

$REVIEW.: My Chromebook came in the mail a few days ago, and I've been using it pretty much the entire time since. First of all, when I first took it out of the box and booted it up for the first time, it was really buggy, the touchpad was wonky, things loaded very slowly, and it was just really bad. However after I shut it down and rebooted it (all of which took only 15 seconds by the way, which is fantastic), I was told that Chrome was now downloading a "critical update." After this, things have just been amazing. This really is a testament to how far and fast Chrome has and can improve. Plus, there's an update for Chrome every ~6 weeks which just makes things absolutely amazing.KEYBOARD: in a word, amazing. The island- style chiclet keys have great travel and feedback, are extremely comfortable and easy to type on, and within the first 30 minutes of using the Chromebook I was typing error free and at my usual speed. The keyboard is probably one of the best features of this laptop. There's also function keys up top that control brightness, volume, and various other things, which is really handy.TRACKPAD: I love this. It feels great and works just like the trackpad on higher-end machines. Two-finger scrolling works great, and while there is the occasional hiccup where it doesn't register the second finger, it's a very minor thing and doesn't happen often. There's also three/four finger gestures that allow you to navigate between different tabs if you swipe left/right on the trackpad with three/four fingers. And as expected, there's tap-to-click as well as standard press-trackpad-to-click. My only wish is that Google/Samsung would add pinch-to-zoom gesture on the trackpad.BATTERY: in addition to the keyboard, this is one of the shining features of the Chromebook. As a test, I used it today from 12:45 PM nonstop until 6:10 PM, browsing, reading, and watching tv shows. I bet if I didn't stream any video it could've lasted even longer. There's no question whether or not this will last a full day of work/school- it definitely will. And if you're working offline, maybe on the train or on the bus, it'll probably last even longer. The battery is wonderful- one of the reasons why I chose the Samsung Chromebook over the Acer C7 version, which has an estimated battery life of only 3 hours.SCREEN: very standard. It definitely is usable, sure, but it's not going to blow your socks off with colors, resolution, or anything like that. It gets the job done, and the matte finish helps it with glare, but the brightness has to be set at about 75-80% brightness to view comfortably.CHROME OS: a mixed bag. If you're comfortable with Chrome already and already use Google's vast suite of online products (i.e Gmail, Youtube, Maps, Drive, Search, Translate etc) you'll have no problem with it. However, if you depend on desktop programs such as Photoshop, CAD, offline MS Office (there's SkyDrive which is basically MS's online word processing program- sort of like what Google's Drive does), you'll either have to find basic replacements from the Chrome Web Store, or simply make do without them. Not only that, once you're offline your Chromebook's functionality is severely limited. You can still edit and create documents and such on (offline enabled) Drive, and view and compose new emails on the Offline Gmail app, and some other things if you find the right app for it, but mostly, there isn't much you can do once you're out of range of a WiFi hotspot. If you plan on using this at home 24/7 however, this shouldn't be a problem.BUILD QUALITY: not very good. While the plastic is solid and feels sturdy enough, it's very easily scratched, so it's best to purchase a sleeve or case of some sort to keep it safe whenever you're not using it. In fact, it's so easily scratched, I've already found three or four scuffs and scratches on the top and bottom even though I've literally carried it around on a pillow, and used it on top of the foam that came in the packaging. Very unpleasant. But for the price, I guess that's a tradeoff you'll have to live with.WRAPUP: I'm very pleased with this. It works like I expected, has great battery life and keyboard quality, and although the screen isn't that good, and the build quality is less than stellar, they're two things I'll just have to live with. Just know what you're buying, folks. This isn't an ultrabook nor is it even a standard laptop. It's a Chromebook, and if you buy this expecting to GET a Chromebook, you'll be quite happy. Don't buy this expecting the same functionality of a full-blown Windows or OSX machine, because you will be disappointed. For it's purpose, it's a great device.However, I have recently come across some complaints online about the screen spontaneously breaking on its own without even being touched or dropped or damaged in the least. I have no idea what might cause this, and my Chromebook seems to have no problem so far, but I really hope those are isolated occurrences.I'll update this review as time passes if anything comes up, or if my views change, but until then feel free to leave any questions you guys might have. I'll try to help the best I can!-------------------UPDATE 1:I recently bought a case for my Chromebook- it's called the iPearl mCover case. It's a snap-on plastic shell for the top and bottom, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to protect their Chromebook. This laptop on its own feels very thin and flimsy, but now it's much more solid with the case on it. I've also written a review on the case on the product listing here:iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6" Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi or 3G) laptop - CLEAR(and for anyone wondering, I am not advertising for this company. This is my honest experience with their product).-------------------UPDATE 2:After using the Chromebook for multiple months, I can safely say that this is a great computer who does the majority of their work online. The battery life continues to be great, with 5-6 hours of continuous use (or about 3 when streaming video). One complaint I have is how the Chromebook ships with a proprietary charger (micro-USB port like the HP Chromebook 11 would have been far more handy and convenient). The keyboard keys and trackpad feel as responsive and clicky as ever as well, and everything in general has been great even after extended use. I have not experienced the 'spontaneous screen crack' that other people have been victims of, for which I am very glad. It seems those issues really are only limited to earlier models, and that the build quality issues have been ironed out.

$REVIEW.: This is my first tripod and I'm not a very experienced photographer. I've used it on a Canon PowerShot and I wouldn't recommend it for large cameras. It's been a great addition to my camera and really improves the quality of my shots and the value of the camera itself. There are many similar products. I got this one even though it was more expensive than others on Amazon because I could get free shipping.If you're very worried about camera shake, use the tripod with the self-timer feature. I also like using the tripod to hold my small camera in my hands. Also putting my the camera in continuous shooting mode while on my dashboard during a drive produced some nice shots.The tripod is a nice addition to a camera and its so cheap it's not worth thinking about too long. I doubt there are many differences between brands so just find the best deal.

$REVIEW.: As with a lot of other photographers, I am a bag junkie
 This is probably my 6th or 7th bag, and I think I may finally be done!I switch out the contents of my bag depending on what I'm going to shoot

 At max load, I have been able to fit the following items into the main compartment:* D700 body with grip* D90 body with grip* 70-200 f/2.8* 24-70 f/2.8* 85 f/1.4* 11-16 f/2.8 (Tokina)* lens hoods for all but the 11-16The insert that comes with the bag is a 4-square sectional for lenses that takes up 1/3 of the center compartment
 I store both of my bodies on one side (each wrapped in a washcloth to keep it from rubbing) and the lens hoods on the other side
I'll take a picture and upload it this weekend.The side pockets are pretty roomy
 They not large enough to hold a speedlight, but they can easily hold a small collapsible white card or several card wallets, etc.The other thing I really like about this bag is the material
It's metal and canvas and I am very comfortable that it's not going to break on me
It doesn't necessarily look like a camera bag (though all the side pockets make it stand out a little bit)


 From other photographers I've talked to, the bag only gets better with age as the canvas wears.The bag is pretty large - the biggest camera bag I own

 If I ever buy another bag, it would probably be a smaller Domke for when I don't need such a big bag lol.Pictures have been posted showing how everything fits in the bag

Sorry for the obnoxious red carpet :)

$review_text.: Overall:  great for taking and making calls, but not ideal for exercise.  Here's why:Pros:+ High quality audio, including good bass boost (good for music or calls)+ Long battery life (7-8 hours listening to music the whole time).  It also tells you the exact # of hours charge remaining.+ Calls are clear, and your voice is clearly audible to the other person.  This is because of the dual mics.  Also works well in wind or with background noise - even in subway stations, or out and about in the Windy City, these noises didn't overpower my voice and I was still audible to the listener.Cons- Feel like they're always about-to-fall-off; come off with a slight touch.  Here's why:1. The back cable is somewhat stiff, so a push on it from behind, such as from a coat collar, hat, scarf, or hand, pushes not only the cable but one of the earpieces... right off your ear.  A tug on it, and an earpiece falls off as well.2. Earpieces fit &#34;just okay&#34; - although adjustable, don't hug the ear great.- Poor ease of use; difficult to use eyes-free and buttons hard to press.  It's hard to differentiate between all 3 buttons on the left side without looking.  Buttons are somewhat hard to press, but more-so, they are inefficiently placed, so I sometimes have to use two hands.  Also, by pressing the volume buttons you risk knocking it off your head.- Poor button placement.  It's very difficult to adjust the earpieces (take them on or off) without accidentally pressing a button.- Mediocre comfort of earpieces in the ear. Not bad, but not great.Exercising: If nothing touches them, they will stay on even with vigorous head movement.  But that's not ideal.Comparisons:  I would highly recommend the Jabra Sport Bluetooth headset over this Backbeat for exercising.  Why? Because of ease of use, fit, and comfort.  I own both products.

$REVIEW.: This arrived with no instructions or paperwork. The hole on the side that is supposed to toggle between 720/1080 doesn't seem to have an actual button or switch and just goes to the green circuit board. I'm an idiot with this stuff but my 1080 TV is recognizing it as a 720input. But I'm not sure if it makes a difference since the max wii output is 480P? In any case, it does the job, reception looks better than the stock composite cables it came with...

$REVIEW.: In-Ear headphones are probably the craziest thing to review in my opinion.  Why, because the ear to fit is different for everybody. If you don't get the right fit, you won't hear what your suppose to hear.  In any event, I liked these-- did they blow me away, no.  Because I tried many ranging from $10 to $300, for the money these are not bad at all and I recommend them (if you get the right fit).Some people complain these are missing bass, well, again, it's the fit, I had trouble with that too due to my ear.  Try all the different size ear tips/buds before you toss these, for me, I finally got a fit that's working.  On that note, I tried these in three different systems (with the latter on a conversion plug), CD Player, iPod and even a 150 watt pre-amp and the sound was good.  The latter will have some loss of sound, there not designed for powerfull receivers and amps, but it was good sound.I liked the construction, solid and the earbuds do what they suppose to, they stay in and don't fall out. The unit comes with a nice case too.  So, for $12, is this worth the investment (if you consider $12 an investment, I don't), my answer is yes.
$review_summary.: Solid construction and good sound.

$REVIEW.: I wanted a nice little sleeve for my MacBook Air 11-inch. It doesn't really need an entire laptop bag, but I didn't just want it rattling around in a larger bag. This sleeve is a perfect fit. It seems to be very durable with a nice zipper. I thought it was black with blue inside, but actually it's a very deep blue with aqua inside and it's a nice color combination.I was thinking it was going to be the same old neoprene, but instead it's a thin layer of memory foam. It's very nice and I can see it providing a greater layer of protection for the computer. This is exactly what I needed!

So I picked up this device hoping to fix the issues, and sure enough, it worked!Setup was PAINLESS beyond belief!  I plugged it in, waited 3 mintues, and it was done, completely automatic exactly as described.. A 5 year old could hook this thing up!In testing, it works perfect.. I saturated my internet connection with downloads and video streaming, then tried to make a VOIP call, and the call was crystal clear.

$review_text.: The iPad is a great device but it's somewhat limited for handling the full workload on a short business trip


For long international business trips I'd have to take along my MacBook Air but I've been looking to rely on my iPad 2 for daily mobile usage instead of taking the laptop around all the time
The main irritant about the iPad is having to type on its glass screen for extended periods of time


I'm a fairly proficient touch typist but typing on that screen just doesn't feel right after 10~15 minutes.I also didn't want to get a bulky cover-and-keyboard-combo that essentially made the iPad into a smaller laptop and which made it cumbersome to remove the iPad for its intended use in your hands for reading, web browsing, watching videos, playing games, etc

The great majority of the time I'm using the iPad in the portrait mode and those folio type of cases with the keyboard always seemed to emphasize the landscape mode
So I've been waiting for something to come along that would not compromise the iPad experience while providing a proper keyboard for typing up long emails and reports while on the road.Well, this Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover is exactly what I've been waiting for

It's low profile and fits the iPad perfectly as a cover - both visually and functionally


I do agree with some reviewers that it's a tad heavy and that does cause this keyboard-cover to fall off more easily than other covers like the Apple Magic Cover, but that's a minor quibble when you consider you're getting a very functional keyboard with a pleasant tactile feel
The spacing between the keys is a bit tight but is easy to get used to after a little while

I was typing at nearly my full speed in a few minutes.The "fn" function key along with the home button on the upper left corner are a very nice touch that allows you to execute a lot of common tasks without having to reach out to the screen


All the keys are laid out logically and is easy to get used to if you're familiar with using Mac keyboards

The groove behind the keys to hold the iPad is wide enough to accommodate it with a thin skin cover and that's a really good thing


It would be cumbersome to have to remove the back skin cover every time I wanted to type with the device

The power switch is a good idea as is the status light
It provides all that you need and not any more, which is a very good thing.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this device that I purchased direct from Logitech
I would have bought it from Amazon but it was out of stock
It really does make the iPad that much more useful to get real work done while out on the road

It still won't replace my MBA for the 3~4 week international business trips but it will now suffice for the short 2~3 day local trips, vacations, or one-day excursions
This is a very well-thought-out device and greatly expands the usefulness of the iPad


For me, being able to type up long emails in the portrait mode is worth the price alone

Highly recommended to owners of the iPad 2 and 3.

$review_text.: The build on this head is great, very heavy dudy, but the quick plate system is useless.  It doesnt stay tight and the plate unique. Skip this.*UPDATE*I've tried to replace the quick release plate with a Manfrotto clone, but the thread pattern on the mount is not a standard 1/4-20, not sure what it is...so you have to use the original bolt. It doesn't work well with the small clone, but does work with the larger giottos MH621. It's not great, but will work with lighter cameras...anything heavy will cause it to swivel loose. One solution would be to use a Dremel tool to rework the cut-out in the mount to match the bottom of the quick-plate(not a great solution). Again, skip this ball head...please.

$review_text.: This product is very sturdy as far as build construction and very nice clean lines that sit on any desk underneath a monitor
 However, i am not a fan of no digital audio option, nor am I a fan of the lack of level decerning on the volume of the device
 The biggest turn off for me, which had I not been out of town would have returned it already, is the nearly 1-2 minute delay of the audio from the time you start/wake-up your computer until to hear sound from the device
 I start playing music and it takes far too long before I get sound from this device, the same for movies or online videos etc


 I have even tried plugging in the aux cable directly from the computer and indirectly from the monitor, both going into one of the two line-in connections on the device


 If it were not for this very annoying feature, this product would have received a much better rating from me

 When I do get sound however, it is adequate
 The base is very thin and shallow, but that's to be expected given this is not a high end audio device

 The mid range and highs are actually pretty good for non-hd audio
 I wouldn't reccomend this device if you're looking for high quality sound, but for everyday computer audio with occasioal movie/video or music watching it will do the job, if you can get past the delay and the fact that only an AUX cable is available as your audio input for the device.

$REVIEW.: I have an iPad Air as well as an iPad mini and I love the cameras in them.  However, trying to take decent shots while holding them still is a challenge.  I was looking for a quick and easy way to use a tri-pod to hold the iPads and I found this unit.  So, I decided to give it a try.  Here is what I liked:1.  The mechanism is very straight forward, it uses spring tension to hold rubber runners against the iPad to keep it in place.2.  This unit works on the iPad mini (only when you clamp it on the top and bottom (vertical orientation) because the unit does not compress small enough to hold it in the horizontal plane.3.  This unit works on the iPad Air.Here is what I did not like as much:1.  The thread mount is a standard camera thread but the mount lacks the locking pin hole that keeps the unit from rotating on the tri-pod mount.  So, if you do not get this VERY tight, the iPad can and will start to tilt and loosen up.  This is easily fixed by drilling a small hole in the back to fit the locking pin, but the manufacturer should have done this in the first place.2.  This unit has a nice clamp on two sides, but nothing but friction keeps the iPad in place if you rotate the orientation to change from one orientation to the other.  A small elastic retainer would have been nice that was adjustable.  If you are careful, the unit does stay in place, it just makes me nervous doing that.3.  This does not work with the iPhone.Overall, this is a nice unit that allows you to take advantage of the capabilities of the iPad for taking great portrait or landscape pictures as long as you add the retainer hole on the mount to keep it from rotating.

$review_text.: This is a great little card.  But there are a couple of things to keep in mind before picking it up.1) Don't expect the 300x to make a big difference while you are out shooting, especially if you are using a modern digital SLR.  Cameras seldom take full advantage of flash card speed, largely because they don't have to thanks to their big, fast internal buffers.  99.9% of the time I could get by with a glacially slow card because my DSLR can buffer 40 RAW frames before it even needs to write to the card.2) The 300x will make a big difference when transferring files from the card to your computer, but only if paired with a UDMA card reader.  On paper this card boasts 300x speed, or 45 MB/s.  That seems stellar, but when I plugged it into my trusty USB 2.0 CF card readers, I found the actual transfer speed to be 4 MB/s for both reads and writes!  (Yes, 4 MB/s -- that's not a typo.  And yes, I'm sure it's a USB 2.0 reader using a USB 2.0 port.  I even repeated the exercise with another reader from a different vendor to verify my results.)  I tested by moving several GB of 15MB RAW files, as well as some 1GB video clips to measure sustained performance. Obviously the problem was that my reader could not take advantage of the full UDMA speed of this card.  Fortunately I had a third UDMA USB 2.0 reader, and keeping all other variables constant, using that reader my write speed jumped to 14 MB/s and reads went to 33 MB/s, or about 220x, which is quite respectable and hugely better than the 27x speeds I was enduring before.Make sure your reader supports UDMA and you'll be very happy with this card.

$REVIEW.: Just a brief review, as I'm no photography expert.  This is the third in the Canon Powershot line of cameras I've owned over the years.  While on the other hand my old Nikon F4 SLR from the 80's is still holding its' own.  Perhaps a statement on the general lack of quality in electronics in these days of rapid fire progress and obsolescence.  But...  The changes that have been made over the past 3-4 years in Canon Powershot cameras is stunning.  This model SX110 IS, is a fabulous camera.  The viewing screen is very large, easy to see details, which lends itself to facilitate taking pictures.  The face recognition feature is also an improvement which makes taking good pictures easier than ever.  I've only been using this camera for over a month now, but have only praise for it.  It's a bargain for the money and won't disappoint.  It gets a very high recommendation from me.

$REVIEW.: Personally, I bought this for the swivel mount, the neoprene strap is pretty much useless for me

The swivel mount seems to be made of decent construction
The metal that the strap mount is made of feels somewhat cheap but it has held up so far


The neoprene washer works to keep the screw in place but it seems to be somewhat small
The screw itself locks into place fairly well and so far I have not needed to adjust it.The fact that you can still use a tripod while this is still connected better than similar products but I do see some issues

There isn't a lot of room between the bottom of the metal swiveling section and the bottom of the mount itself
If you have a tripod with a quick release mount, this could prove to be somewhat awkward as the strap will have to move around the quick release.While I have no intentions to use the strap, I did note a few things


The neoprene section of the strap is fairly small, only reaching around my collarbone before the thinner nylon strap material began

The neoprene stretches and in my short test it remained relatively cool on my neck


The overall length the strap can achieve is abysmal by most standards
At its longest, the strap would have the camera hanging around my solar plexus at best
This might work for a smaller point and shoot camera or maybe even a micro four thirds camera, but for my Canon 60D, it's a little high.If you have a strap already then I would recommend buying this for nothing more than the swivel mount

The neoprene strap might work if you are planning on using a smaller camera or don't mind the camera being at your mid to high chest.

$review_text.: The 5 star rating is relative to the low price.  Of course a $300 pair will be better, but for the price...the Klipsch S4's are amazing.  This is my second pair.  My first pair broke, but it was my fault.  Was listening to my iPhone at the gym and the phone fell out of my pocket as I was jump roping.  I had the first set for over a year ($90 back then).  This time I saw the $45 price, so it was a no brainer.Sound quality is great.  Noise isolation is pretty good too.  I study ALOT because I'm a premed.  I study anywhere from the library, computer lab, coffee shops, restaurants, you name it.  You can hear some outside noise in busy restaurants, but I don't notice it much with my music going.  Often, I'll study with friends and I won't notice them trying to get my attention because I can't hear them with the buds in.Comfort is awesome too.  I wear them ALL DAY.  I would say, from 8am-6pm with intermittent breaks for class/food.  Ears never feel fatigued.  I was worried that the oval shaped buds wouldn't fit well, but they work well for me.Just remember, reviews for something like earphones are pretty subjective to user preference.  But in my opinion, these for $45 is a killer deal.

$REVIEW.: For the money it is hard to beat the Sennheiser CX 300 headphones for sound quality and reduction of unwanted outside noise.  Bass is sufficient, highs and mids are crystal clear.  The cord is asymmetrical, which I prefer (the extra cord around the back of my neck keeps them in place even if I pull one bud out, whereas one unplugged symmetrical cables will pull the other off).The key to enjoying the Sennheiser CX 300 is to use the correct sized bud.  If the bud is too large, they are uncomfortable.  If it is too small, you end up with a "tunnel-like" sound.  This is probably true for all ear-bud headphones, and fortunately Sennheiser includes three sizes so you can get them just right for you.In addition to the best possible sound, the correct fit earbud set effectively blocks out much of the surrounding ambient noise.  This feature is great anytime you want to hear your music and not the lawn mower, the TV in the next room, or some other distracting noise.I absolutely recommend these earbuds.  Mine are months old, get daily use, and yet they sound and look just like new.

$review_text.: I don't know what you expect for cheap headphones, but, these work just fine. I think the sound quality is good, and they are built well for kids. One wire from one side helps keep from tangling, and over the ear is more comfortable than buds. If your expecting high quality sound for this price you are crazy. They work and are perfect for kids, and a great price.

$REVIEW.: Syntax is a fantastic company if you are looking for an LCD on a budget.  My logic is this: if all LCDs have a life to them, then why drop loads of money on something that you know will eventually die?  Not a cent will be wasted on this TV - if you can stand a few minor inconveniences.  For one thing, if you have the backlight set to anything below 100%, the TV makes a buzzing, humming sound (which is mostly drowned out by the fan on my HTPC :-P).  The remote that I got likes to act up as well - sometimes it works, other times it doesn't.  The contrast is excellent, although the blacks aren't really pure black, and you can have some wicked backlight patterns if you don't adjust your settings properly.  If you don't know much about LCDs, you may want to purchase another TV, but if you're a geek (like me), this TV is for you.  I hope this review helped! God Bless, and Happy Shopping!!!!

When i first used these, they sounded pretty horrible, but just as other reviewers said, after you use them for a few days, the break in and have a good rich sound with good bass/treble mixture.  I use them on my note 3, and it works great.  Its a bummber that the buttons dont work with my phone but i am still running the stock rom.

$review_text.: The Large Rogue Flashbender has a reflective white surface of about 9.5&#34; by 8.5&#34;, which is larger than many of the flash modifiers unless you purchase an actual softbox. It is logistically more convenient than a softbox in that it can easily be positioned by the photographer in some tight spaces. It fits easily on several speedlights that I have tried using the supplied velcro straps, and fits in a camera bag easily. The metal bands are easily modifiable, and you could even create a flash snoot if you wished. Of course, the larger the light source the more even it appears on your subject.The reflector does not come with a diffusion screen, which is sold separately, The flash fires in an upward direction (commonly), and is reflected back to your subject. A diffusion screen softens the light even more, which if you have any craft skills and take a close look on the net or a retail store, you could easily save money and create the diffuser yourself.

 The Wii remote doesn't fit


 As another reviewer has stated - the slots are made for thin remotes
 I decided to use it in the bedroom, but found my stereo remote (which is short) tries to slide out the sides because it sets in too far


 Don't use on short or fat remotes!  It is not a "flaw" of the item, so I still give it 4 stars
 It just doesn't work well for my intended use
 Still, I've kept it, & use 3 slots instead of 4.

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my wife's TV and it plays everything I expected it to. However, she is not a techie and the UI on the unit isn't the easiest to get around, but after a day or so she is used to it.However, I also bought the wireless USB key to go with it so we could transfer media across our network. That does not work well at all. It is slow and entering your security key with the remote is extremely tedious. Even worse, it forgets the key if the unit is unplugged or loses power. Apparently, the built-in Samba server is buggy, so the only way to reliably transfer media wirelessly is by pulling it from the unit rather than pushing it to the unit, which means I can't transfer media remotely. I ended up not using the key and transfer media to the HDD using a flash stick instead. It's faster, though a little inconvenient.All in all, she's happy with it and I feel that it was worth the price we paid.

$REVIEW.: Out of the box, I was immediately impressed with the rugged feel of theNT31B. The exterior to absorb the shock of a drop. As I continued theinspection of my most recent purchase, I opened the case up and observedthe integrated screen protector. This is a very nice feature, andintroduces no more glare than the iPad screen by itself. The next thing Inoticed was the fact that keyboard had two shift keys, which truth be told,I had researched before purchase, however I feel that it's worth mentioninghere as it's a major selling point for me. As I continued my examination,I continued to be impressed by the apparent strength of the case and I feltvery much at ease that it would protect my investment. Another nicefeature is that the case will actually separate, allowing you to carry justthe iPad without the case, yet still providing full protection. Thisfeature allows for flexibility and in essence give the owner two cases forthe price of one.The dis-assembly of the case to put the iPad in was a bit of a struggle.Again, I think this reflects upon the rugged construction, but I did feela bit concerned that I might break the case trying to remove the outerrubber housing. Re-assembly proved equally a challenge, especially when itcame time to get the button cover in place. There are four rubber tabsaround the button that hold it in place. It took some serious work and abut of prying on the rubber with a small screw driving to get the rubberbutton cover properly seated in place.After a few days of use:I noticed that there was a bit of oily residue between the screen protectorand my iPad, even though before installation, I'd wiped my iPad down withalcohol wipes while wearing rubber gloves. This residue creates a bit of arainbow effect on the screen when viewed from certain angles when thescreen is off or at low backlight settings. It absolutely does not impactthe usability of the case nor does it detract from the operationalexperience. To be fair, I haven't had a single case for any device, fromany vendor, that had an integrated screen protector where this oily residuewasn't present in some fashion.The ability to rotate the iPad to a verticle upright position was a nicefeature. I don't use it in this manner often, but it's nice to be able todo so.It took a couple of days to actually need to use the keyboard. The overallfeel is decent. It's important to remember that this is an iPad Mini case,so the keyboard is going to be a compromise at best. Again, the two-shiftkey model is far superior to the single shift key for anyone who canremotely be considered a touch typist. I ran into a bit of a learningcurve when it came time to use the question mark. Actually there are a fewkeys that require a function key, those being the ?, both slashes / and \as well as the quotes. The tilde, pipe, and brackets are probably OK formost users requiring an alternate toggle key, but I think I'd prefer theother keys to be available by using alternate key combinations. Keypresses exhibit a click of sorts, and I wonder if perhaps the keys wouldn'thave been better having been made from a softer material. So far, albeitwith light use, no issues with the printing on the keys. The last keyboardrelated comment is the location of the Apple key or the equivalent of theone-touch key on the iPad. It's in the upper left, and other cases I'veused had it in the upper right.Additional thoughts:The case does contain magnets, so you can enable the lock/unlock feature toautomatically lock the iPad when you close the case.The cover for the charging port on the keyboard could lock more in placewhen closed. After charging the keyboard for the first time, the coverremained sprung open for several hours. After a while the plug returned toit's naturally closed state, but initially it remained partially opened.The LEDs on the keyboard are rather dim. While I understand the need fornot burning up the battery, it should be more clear that an LED is lit.I'm curious as to how long the rubber covers and the closure snap will lastgiven daily use. I think that I would prefer a magnetic closure as opposedto the closure snap.

$review_text.: I only use reflectors occasionally so I wasn't looking to drop the $80+ dollars on a name brand like Lastolite.  I've used this particular reflector on about a dozen shoots now, both indoors and outdoors and have had no problems with durability.  However, if you do a lot of outdoor shoots and it's windy outside, I could see this thing ripping easily.  Compared to a buddy's Lastolite reflector, you understand quickly why the Fotodiox is cheaper.  However, the light output to my eye is identical with the silver and gold.  The white side doesn't seem to reflect as much light as the Lastolite though.  But if you're like me and only use the reflector on occasion, save your money and get this one.

$REVIEW.: For starters, this is the only dvr left on the market in the USA, although there is also a similar and slightly cheaper model from Polaroid. For some reason all the manufactures stopped making them here. From about 2004-2006 every major electronics manufacturer, had Hard Disk recorder models for sale. What the hell happened? In Europe you can still have numerous brand models to choose from including multiple models from Phillips.Previous to this I was still using vcr's to record something. The dvr is a huge step up from that. No more looking for tapes, and trying to figure out whats on the tape or how much room is left, etc. This model holds about 30 hours at the best quality. I only record shows once awhile and I'm already aware when they are coming on. Its hooked up to an old Samsung crt tv and the picture playback quality is indisguisable from the original at the highest setting. I have not recorded with the lower settings. I don't know how the difference would appear on an hdtv screen. One bad thing about this model is it does not record or upconvert to  1080p like it claims, which you can read about on cnet.The menu is pretty basic  and mostly black and white, but is easy to use for the most part. Its easy to record and delete selections and you can view thumbnails of your recording which play with sound too when you scroll on them. The dvd, player also works fine, but I have yet to try and burn a dvd from a hard drive recording. However, it doesn't appear difficult. You cannot copy a dvd to the hard drive on this model.The remote is normal size but some of the most important buttons are too small and oddly placed, making it difficult to operate this remote by feel.Overall, if you want a device to replace your vhs, and don't want monthly fees, this is your best and currently only real option. If you only record shows once in awhile and are not concerned about the lack of tv menus, and other features found on tivo devices, you should be happy with this. If you record numerous hours of tv a week, and don't know when shows come on, or want to record more then one program at a time, then you need to get a tivo

Bottom line is , this TV is beyond incredible and is everything I hoped it was going to be and a whole lot more 
By now the specs and features are all common knowledge and so forth so I won't bore you with that but here's a lil' insight that you probably haven't heard or read 

This HDTV is apaprently 4K compatible and will support it with a software upgrade that has already come out and of course been installed via it's built in Wi-Fi connection or thru it's wired ethernet cable input if you prefer .This TV is so phenomenal we tried to buy a 2nd once in the next size up for our living room but were unable to find one anywhere 


Disappointing but we just recently ended up buying a new Sony 3D HDTV for our living room and I 'll be honest , it's not as nice as this one is , this particular model line had an absolutely unbelievable picture with vibrant colors you won't believe , a smoothness in motion that is 2nd to none and more features than you can shake 10 sticks at !!!

$review_text.: The build quality of this case and keyboard overall, is top notch. The stitching is clean, the black pseudo-leather has a nice marbled texture, and the keyboard tray is lined with soft felt. The zipper is sturdy; its long rubber tab makes it very easy to draw the zipper open and shut.I underestimated how huge and awkward the case would be when it is open on my desk, or on my lap. I realize that I don't really want my notes or important papers or my ID flopping around lying face-up like that for all the world to see whenever I zip open my Ipad case to type something up.THE KEYBOARD:The keyboard itself is delightfully small and lightweight, and has an all-plastic construction - black with a fine even matte texture - all of which which means that it's very durable. There is no glossy plastic anywhere - which is a huge plus that means there's nothing to collect fingerprints or to scratch up. The keyboard seems to automatically connect with the Ipad each time it is turned on, without a fuss. It is held in place only with magnets. That's a nice professional touch.I like the fact that the keyboard is designed so that it can do double or triple duty with a Microsoft or Android (Honey Comb or later) machine. You have all the Microsoft function keys available, and also a forward-delete button (these, naturally, will not work in the same fashion on an Ipad).The key response, overall, seems quite solid. Many people will be fond of the 2mm of travel and the resistance the keys give to the touch. I, however, feel that there is too much travel, and that the keys need to be pressed with more force than I'm comfortable with (this is compared to standard-issue Apple keyboards). I have found that if a keyboard is too stiff or spongy, it can fatigue my hands and even make them cramp up when typing at high speeds for long periods of time. I also worry about the fact that the keys tend to wobble back and forth a little bit after they're fully depressed; this means that there is some risk that the key will depress without the electrical contact being made (especially when it comes to larger buttons like the backspace and the enter key). I notice quick successive presses of the arrow keys will not consistently register.Finally, my Apple Ipad 3 itself (with IOS 6.1), has some troubling limitations in that it doesn't allow a forward delete - and the slow key-repeat speed cannot be adjusted. As someone else mentioned - lack of Bluetooth mouse support is also a huge drawback.OTHER STUFF:I have a big concern about the velcro (hook and loop) strip running along the base of the Ipad which is there to hold the angle. It seems like the sort of thing that will, over time, gum up and become useless. Even brand new, it feels like a flimsy way to hold the thing in place.The Ipad is held in its pouch with a flap of pseudo-leather, backed on one side with felt. It is not clipped in, in any way - but because the case zips shut when it's being carried around, this won't cause a hazard.The stylus holder is a nice amenity.The Ipad case has cut-outs for all the various ports and buttons on the device.There is no magnet to turn your Ipad off, automatically.There is no way to stand the Ipad up, vertically.Offers very effective protection from dropping and other similar accidents.________Weight:Keyboard only ... 178 gramsCase and keyboard together ... 734 gramsCase, keyboard and Ipad 3 ... 1390 gramsDimensions:27.4cm x 22.8cm x 4cm

$review_text.: Comply foam eartips are a great upgrade over the stock silicon eartips included with most earphones / IEMs.  Where I find that silicon eartips become uncomfortable within 60 minutes (if I'm lucky) or 10 minutes (if I'm not lucky or the eartip fit / design is poor), I've not yet had any comfort issues with the Comply T-500 tips.One thing to note is that these tips have a tendency to slightly muffle high treble coming out of the earphones. This can be a negative or positive depending on how "bright" the earphone's sound is. The Comply tips also make it much easier to get a good seal in the ear, which is essential for most earphones to get realistic bass response.(Note: I use black T500s with Ultimate Ears 700 earphones.  In this case I found the slight reduction in treble to be a plus.)

Not sure if my excitement over the Note is simply due to it being such a new experience or not.  We'll see in 6 months.Does anyone else have light bleed on their Note?  Mine is in the bottom left corner.  Noticeable for sure but not quite to the point of being annoying.  After reading some forums many have it worse.  There is a great App in the Play Store that detects light bleed and/or dead pixels.  Just search for "light bleed" and it will be the 1st App.  Luckily I have no dead pixels.I like the tablet so much I'm going to keep it.  Not worth returning it and taking a chance on another one.

$review_text.: OK - it's not CB, but it is the best &#34;emergency crank&#34; digital scanning and tuning shortwave receiver you will find. This was an upgrade to my 12-year-old Eton manual-tune emergency radio, with a lot of nice new enhancements.  This one has many powering options, including AC-to-DC power inputs, solar, or &#34;make your own&#34; 4xAA NiMH plug-in pack for longer use than the internal crank battery.  The flashlight is now LED vs. the older units mini-mag bulb.  The sockets have plug-seals to provide weather resistance - however, the unit is not &#34;water-proof&#34; and should not be left in the rain or exposed outdoors for extended times (so how does that solar panel on top work?!?).  Still a nice unit for the price.  Finish it off with a reel-up SW clip-on antenna (Radio Shack?

$REVIEW.: This has been the closest I've ever been to a "plug 'n play" wireless router experience and it's been a very positive one.Out of the box I noticed that even the cabling had been set up with the power and ethernet cable already connected to the router.  Each cable was tagged with a small cardboard label and  the router itself had a card to record user and password info.The 1-2-3 steps were no lie.  Plug the ethernet cable into your net modem, power up the router, and load the software.  I followed the instructions to set up a personalized network name (SSID) and password but even if I hadn't, a password and ID had already been assigned by Belkin.  The router software is functional and clearly labeled so even first-time users shouldn't have any problems setting up a wireless network.Connecting to the router was really easy and having set up this new router using the same SSID and access password as I had with my old router, my components didn't hiccup at all with the switch. In addition, I set up a higher speed connection as well as a guest connection with the same ease.Overall I really like this router and have found it to be extremely easy to set up and manage. Reliability seems to be excellent with no drops at all since its initial installation.In my book this router is a real winner.

$REVIEW.: All of my reviews start at 5 stars and work their way down.  I can find nothing to criticize here...so 5 stars it is.I bought this primarily for a used Denon iPod dock that was gifted to me for my home entertainment system.  It came without the adapters.  Denon doesn't sell them separately, and universal adapters don't fit.My devices are a 4th Generation iPod classic, a 5th Generation iPod Nano, and an iPhone 3Gs.  All worked perfectly, including being powered through the cable.  I also tested it on two JVC bookshelf stereo systems in my bedroom and home office, as well as an extension for the iPod cable on my Pioneer auto stereo system.  This cable works perfectly with all of them.This is a well made, high quality cable that will almost certainly outlast the devices I bought it for.  A bit more expensive than most similar products.  But you know, you get what you pay for.

$REVIEW.: I bought this outdoor antenna for use with my Sirius SR550 Home Unit and DBS combiner/splitter and couldn't be happier with its performance

 It installed easily on top of my patio cover in about 15 minutes with all the necessary hardware included
Because I already have DirecTV, I used the Terk antenna in conjunction with the DBS combiner/splitter so I could run the satellite radio antenna with my satellite TV cable.The Terk outdoor antenna has plenty of "joints" to move it in virtually any direction you want, so setup was also very easy


 Loosen a few screws, move it so the antenna "faces" the appropriate direction, and tighten the screws


The antenna cable connection has a weatherproof cover so no worries about anything happening to the connection

Once I got it hooked up, I turned on my satellite radio and got a full signal right from the start


 In fact, only sometimes do I lose the signal for a brief moment as the antenna "locks" into the satellite when I first turn the unit on, but after about 5 or 10 seconds, I never have a dropped signal.Overall, this product is well constructed, easy to install, and works great

 I would highly recommend it over the antennas that come with either the home units or home kits for PnP Sat radios.

$REVIEW.: Bought this to charge NiMH C/D cells; already have a MaHa charger for AA/AAA that I love.  So far the Maha charger handled all my no-name and Powerizer C / D cells in a few hours, stopped charging like it was supposed to, and the cells stayed nice and cool the whole time. It is very quiet (softly clicks about once a second only when charging, no noise when empty, no high pitched whining at all).Perfect.I already have another high-end smart charger that never seems to finish charging some cells (days!) and gets the cells so hot you can't touch them.  I'd been blaming the batteries.  The MaHa charger has no trouble with the same cells.

I've really grown to like them a lot


They come with a variety of earbud styles - I chose the foam, the squishy kind that you compress and then place


I've really grown to like this style since they are very unobtrusive and expand to fit my ear best.The sound is great


I've used them for podcasts, movies, and all kinds of music

It is very clear, layered and rich

The wires are long and a little stiff


They come with a hard shell, zippered case that will hold the earphones and extra bud tips.These are really lightweight and comfortable and have become my go to headphones.I was provided a unit for evaluation and review.

$REVIEW.: I've been curious about Blu-rays for awhile, but didn't see the need to spend the money.  We have a 54" flat screen TV with surround sound and watch movies on it all the time. I decided it was time to upgrade our DVD player when I came across this Blu-ray at Amazon, particularly because it streamed Netflix etc, and it wasn't over $100.  Previously we were watching Netflix movies through the Wii, which was kind of a hassle.  Now its simple and we can look for movies at other locations too.  We finally watched a Blu-ray DVD this past weekend, and I have to admit the picture was awesome.  I now see what the big deal of having a Blu-ray really is.  And we got it for less than $100 and installation was no problem what so ever.

I read the directions and it was easy to apply. I had bubbles but I was able to remove those easily and quickly using a cleaning cloth. If you have bubbling, start from the center of the screen and work towards the edge with a cloth. That worked for me. I prefer the matte finish to reduce glare and reflection. I don't like looking at myself while I read or play games. Recommended.

$REVIEW.: I ordered this from Vine because I thought it might be a cool protector for my mini


While it looks cool enough, the looks are deceiving


Outside of the Lego potential, this is a flimsy, cheap piece of plastic that offers little protection and has very little upside


Not only is it Dollar Store crap, but the Lego surface actually makes it less easy to take around, as the nubs get snagged and caught on things
I foolishly assumed that one buys covers/cases to protect their expensive electronics, not to turn them into surfaces for other activities
This product is all style with no substance
You can buy sturdier, less expensive protection for your device.If you're not concerned with protecting your investment and don't see the irony in turning your expensive toy into the base for a cheaper toy, this is your product
Otherwise, save your money.

$review_text.: Amazingly simple to setup.  Plug it into a computer via USB, create a Dropcam username, connect to wifi, unplug from computer, plug in anywhere there's a power outlet and wifi signal.  Blammo.  Streaming video online.  No need to configure router or firewall or DNS settings. The camera is also quite good in low light, even with the IR night vision mode disabled, the image picks up details in near darkness with acceptable graininess. We have ours inside of a window, so the IR is turned off, but yet we can see outside in the video as if we were looking out the window ourselves.Only downside to the Dropcams is the varying delays in the video stream (varying from 1 to 4 seconds) and the audio stream (3-7 seconds).  So someone talking into the Dropcam would need to know to wait up to 14 seconds to know if there was a response.  Or in my case, by the time I give a command to my dogs over the Dropcam audio, they're already done chewing up the plant and off in another room wondering why I'm correcting them for lying innocently on the floor.

$REVIEW.: I've been using it for about 3 weeks, so I feel like I have a good picture of what it is and how it works. But I haven't used the software that comes with it because I just don't feel the need.I'm using it between 2 desktop computers, one an emachine with Windows 7 64-bit, the other a Compaq with Windows XP. I always use the buttons when I'm switching between machines, but I have used the double-Scroll Lock, and it works fine. Switching between computers is never a problem as long as they're both awake. I find that this thing works reliably and consistently but with the following problems. (I initially thought the Trendnet was flaky and intermittent, but it's just about finding out how it works.)1) When you have only one keyboard and mouse, you can wake up a sleeping computer by moving the mouse. With the Trendnet, I usually have to wake up the computer (either one of them) by pressing the power button on the computer. (Both of my computers are the kind where you have to hold the power button for about 4-5 seconds in order to turn it off.) Pressing the power button wakes it up and then the Trendnet will work with it. Sometimes, moving the mouse around a lot will wake up the computer, but usually that doesn't work and it's just as easy to press the power button. This is not a problem as long as you know what to expect.2) This is a BIG problem: the USB connector for the mouse is not a snug fit. Lucky for me, I'm using a cordless mouse (MS Wireless Mobile Mouse 3000) so the only time I have a problem is when I move a cord or something and it nudges the mouse receiver in the Trendnet. Then the mouse operation is very jerky. I have to finagle the connector in the USB port until I get it in the right position for the mouse to work right. Then it's okay until something moves it again. Just IMAGINE if the mouse were on a cord: every time I used the mouse, it would move the connector in the Trendnet. This thing would never work right, and I'd have taken it back the same day.3) Switching speed: If you want something that will switch between computers quickly, this is not it! Now, there are times when it will switch in about 2 seconds, and it's a clean switch. (Mouse and keyboard both working immediately.) But there are other times (most times, actually) when it will take 10-20 seconds; first the screen comes up, but the mouse or keyboard doesn't work for a little bit. For some reason, if you're switching back and forth really often, you get quicker switch times. But I use one computer most often, and only go to the other one every now and then, and it's a pretty slow switch, even if both computers are awake.UPDATE 07-14-10The mouse now doesn't work at all because the USB port has gotten looser. I'll have to take it back to the store today.UPDATE 07-29-10The USB port on the new one is nice and snug but there may still be a problem with the mouse; I'm not really sure. Because even though the connector doesn't feel loose, a lot of times the mouse gets very jerky and almost impossible to move. But if I plug the mouse receiver right into the computer itself, there's no problem.Here's another problem with the new unit: About half the time, when you're in the middle of rebooting, the KVM switches to the other machine! Now, besides the fact that, if I wanted to be on the other machine, I'd just SWITCH IT (!), you're definitely not supposed to switch it when one of your machines is rebooting, because it screws up your screen resolution. Consequently, sometimes after the machine comes up and I switch the KVM back to that machine, the screen resolution is off and I have to reset it. What a pain!In short, if there was another KVM that got consistently (or even mostly) good reviews, I'd definitely get it and give this back to Radio Shack.

Best part is that it doesn't require a wii remote to be plugged in to connect to the game.

$REVIEW.: Installed the Intel Network 6235AN.HMWWB in ASUS N550JV-DB72T in about 5 minutes.Instantly saw both 2Ghz and 5Ghz network connections

 Bluetooth works well too.These ought to be the standard in all laptops.The card didn't come with drivers, but the default Windows 8 drivers work
 I downloaded the latest ones from Intel.



$review_summary.: Easy to install and very reasonable price.

$review_text.: I work in enterprise storage with NAS and SAN technologies


I don't expect a consumer grade product to live to the standards set by NetApp or perhaps EMC, but right out of the box, as a home device this WD product was a little dubious


It looked simple enough; put a couple slots in the top and (ironically enough) it could pass for a toaster
The back of the unit only has connectivity for 1) an AC plug, 2) one RJ-45 ethernet connection, and 3) one USB connection

The rest of the unit strives to look sleek and streamlined

There is no power button.The device was having trouble being recognized
I used the ethernet cable that came with the unit

Speaking of which, the cable could have been longer, a couple more feet in length and it would have seemed less like a leash to the wireless router
I tried every port on the wireless router multiple times, I tried swapping out the cable, the device just wasn't showing up


I was getting the impression that the device might have a defective network jack
I then connected it directly to the laptop which recognized it

I wish I could explain what magic happened, but after that I reconnected it to the router and it was now visible.Once connectivity was established it seemed like free sailing


The device is managed by entering its IP address into a browser

The management interface is fairly intuitive although menus are layered so you sometimes have to drill down to get to what you're looking for

Out of the box the NAS device is configured as RAID 0

I place a higher value on fault tolerance than maximum speed so right off the bat I used the management GUI to convert to RAID 1
This mirroring of the two internal drives means that this becomes a 3 TB storage device but the added insurance is worth it
I'm guessing it must have taken somewhere between nine and twelve hours for the NAS unit to complete the reconfiguration to RAID 1; I started it around dinnertime, left it running overnight and by morning it was done.At that point the device is usable immediately


The included CD installs a utility required on any PC to provide network connectivity to the NAS unit
The default share contains several empty folders with names suggesting use for particular file types, along the lines of Microsoft's "My Documents"

I left the device running for a few days just for kind of a break in period.Here's a major design flaw: no power button

The only way to power down is through your browser


Problem is, if you encounter any kind of network difficulties, or if the network jack on the device goes bad the only way to power the unit down is to yank the AC cable


A storage device is the last device in the world you'd want to do that to; it risks a head crash

A head crash very likely means that your data is unrecoverable even by a professional data recovery service
As I think about it I believe this device does have one of those pinprick sized holes where you can shove a paperclip into it to reset it to factory defaults

Perhaps that will reboot the device as well...or maybe not.Once the device was up and running and had the benefit of some break in time I started moving data to it


I did a series of large data moves to it


Perhaps I should have thought twice
Even before any data transfers took place, during the break in period this device would occasionally send overheating alerts

Typically, half an hour later it would send another alert that temperature was okay

Near-constant data transfers had been taking place over the wireless network for about 29 hours when the device sent out the alert, "Initiating thermal shutdown - Your device is critically overheated and is shutting down immediately to prevent damage."I'm glad it responded to the threat by attempting to shut down
Thing is, it didn't shut down

When I checked the status of my moves and then the condition of the NAS device I found that the disks were still spinning
It supposedly had shut down half an hour or forty five minutes earlier but it was still hot as a griddle with disks spinning


I had to use the GUI to manually power it down.Another major design flaw: the device has no fan
Its construction is such that it's two hard drives with about the space of one bay between them which contains the motherboard for the unit

There are vents - on the top of the unit and on the bottom; clearance on the bottom is what, maybe a quarter of an inch? And none on the sides or back, so half the vents are useless unless you mount the thing on its side.I don't even have all my data transferred to this NAS unit and I'm already concerned


RAID is good but the flaw with home NAS RAID devices is that if the unit itself goes down, you need to find some other means of recovery

With no power button this really should have redundancy with two RJ-45 network jacks

I'm just not impressed and would not recommend this device

I give it two stars instead of one because I have not lost any data...yet.Update: The device has been off for over twelve hours
It's cooled down, so for purposes of populating it with the initial data for which it was intended I have moved it from the router and have given it a direct connection to the network jack of the system from which I am transferring data
It recognized immediately and was available at the same network drive mapping I'd assigned when it was connected to the wireless network

I have placed it on its side, on a trivet, to help with heat dissipation, with a small fan a foot away blowing directly on it
Hopefully this will suffice for populating it with data but the device had better not require this level of accomodation indefinitely.Update: I left the device on and directly attached to the host from which data was transferring
The device was still sitting on its side on a trivet to help with heat dissipation, in an open area with its vents unobstructed


With a small room fan positioned a foot away no heat alerts appeared for four days.But within an hour after I removed the fan and returned it to one of the kids' rooms at bedtime, around 10:30pm the critical heat alert reappeared

Again it alleged to be shutting the system down


Again the system didn't actually shut down; it was still running when I woke up the next morning
Given this performance, the "Shut Down Device" option should be available from the main splash screen for the NAS device's management interface rather than being buried under the Utilities menu item.I am lowering the rating of this device from two stars to one
A storage device is the most critical piece of a home network


I regret this purchase.

$review_text.: I bought this to be able to switch between my Blu-ray and my Roku box
 Even with my Blu-ray turned off and manual selection, it doesn't work right with the Roku
 Every minute or so, the picture on my TV blanks out for several seconds

 Then it comes back, only to repeat again a minute later


 I can plug both the blu-ray and the Roku directly into my TV using the same cables and they both work fine
 I'm very sorry that I bought two of these (one for each TV) without trying one out first

 They both will be going in the trash.

$review_text.: My adventure with Sonos started with a simple desire to put speakers on my patio

I started by looking at the zone2 capabilities of my receiver limited by analog-only sources, then considering an amp, new receiver with pre-amps, etc etc etc
This way is so much easier


ZoneBridge to my router, ZonePlayer 120 wired to my speakers outside, done
The media organization is ultimately what sold me on this solution


Sonos supports DLNA (Win7), file shares (PC/NAS), free internet radio, and subscribed media services


The interface is clean and simple to use
You can load the controller app on your PC/Mac to control everything, use the iPhone/pad app (Droid soon), or buy their controller device


I opted for the PC controller and will add the Droid app when it's available
Switching between media sources is seamless and easy
You can go from listening to SiriusXM to Pandora to MP3's on your network in seconds flat
Music quality is fantastic via the 120 through my new Polk Atrium 5's
MORE than enough for my patio/pool area


I am extremely happy with my purchase and will be adding to the system over time.Pros:- Incredible sound quality- Whole house audio without the wiring mess- Solid build quality/ design- Easy expansion- Sonos media manager is fantasticCons:- Buy in can be steep (but cheaper than a new receiver!)
