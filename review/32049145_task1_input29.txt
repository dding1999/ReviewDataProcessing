$REVIEW.: &#34;I really loved this book. If it's meant to be, then it will happen. Finn was the perfect bad boy with a heart of gold. Faith is one of my new favorite heroines. Faith and Finn's road was not one easily traveled, but I loved that they got their HEA in the end. Don't make the mistake of passing this one up. It was definitely worth my time and money well spent. I loved it and will be reading more by Tabatha Vargo. She is a talented author. I was hooked by the end of the first chapter. So have a little faith and check out Finding Faith, you won't regret it. :D Definitely adding this one to my list of favorites!&#34;

$REVIEW.: WOW, it's been quite a while since I've read a real page turner like this. A young woman survives an accident with resulting amnesia. She was in a precarious position prior to the accident and now she's not sure who to trust or believe. The author has laid the groundwork for an amazing series. She's built into this novella a great deal of information on the characters, background and the current situation.&#34;To be continued&#34; had better not take too long, I can't wait to read more!

$review_text.: This is a very well constructed story line. It keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what is going to happen next. Eve really knows how to keep it interested from start to finish with laughter, tears, nail biting and occasionally the need to yell at the characters in the book.*slight spoiler alert!* I also can't get over the clever way Eve had the characters use Roderick's ashes which you should remember from the end of the last book. May I just say &#34;Eeewww&#34;, it made me shudder! I was sooo worried at the end of the last book when the ashes were collected by a mysterious person. You have got to read what happens with them. You won't believe it!I loved reading about how the 2 men grow and evolve to redeem their earlier behavior. Watching how Antonia deals with all the changes in her life as well as learning how to love and accept her two men was a sheer delight. Thaddeus epitomizes so many of my favorite alpha characteristics. Watching him fall in love was bliss. Marc was so destroyed in the last book, watching his recovery into a strong and trustworthy man was heartwarming.Strong MCs and secondary characters, non-stop action, evil villeins, death, destruction and of course love everlasting. *happy sighs*Can you tell I really had fun reading this story?

$review_text.: "The Bravest Boy I Ever Knew" is a great book that follows a little boy named Michael as he thinks about all of the things that makes his best friend so brave.  I think this is a very important story that will teach kids about people who may have a handicap that causes them to use a wheelchair.  They will learn that being in a wheelchair doesn't mean you can't have fun just like everyone else! I loved the fact that Michael's focus isn't on any restrictions that the situation could bring, but rather just how capable and brave his best friend is.  He even hopes to someday be as brave as his friend is!  This is a valuable book for anyone who wants to expose their children to this issue as well as a great reminder for those in a wheelchair that, even if they do things different, they can do things just as well as everyone else!The illustrations are great and will definitely be an eye catcher for your child.My little boy loved looking at the pages as I read the story for him!I received this book from the author in exchange for my honest review.

$review_text.: Bad boy and rock star Everett Lester has become an unwitting tool of the enemy. His fame and fortune are vast, but they mean nothing to a man struggling to make sense of a life grounded in pain. Only the soft voice of one young woman can break though Everett's dark despair and shows him the light of God and the love of Jesus. Yet the dark forces of evil will do anything to keep Everett in its grasp.Dark Star is an amazing and suspenseful story of one man's journey from darkness to light and the messangers put in his life to help him along the way. The salvation message is clear and simple--not a sermon, just the truth.I loved the way the book is written in two parts, as a memoir and in current events. As a stickler for a satisfying ending, Dark Star passes the test with flying colors. Can't wait to dig into the sequel, Full Tilt.

$review_text.: Ali is a high-flying attorney, a bit overwhelmed by her own personal dramas and feeling vaguely unsatisfied in her eleven year relationship with Adam.  Personally, I think that despite her modern chanting of &#8220;I am woman, hear me roar&#8221; she is essentially searching for a solution to the vague disquiet she feels, and doesn&#8217;t dare examine.  Adam was the center of her universe, next to her job and the occasional reprimands she extends to her twin sister Kayla.  She has set all of her eggs in one basket, and when the cracks start to show, she begins to project her own dissatisfaction toward Adam.Anthony is a new solicitor in the firm, a very high flier he arrived with several accolades and is very accomplished in the criminal defense arena.  When a celebrity client&#8217;s case turns from a reasonably minor traffic complaint into a murder investigation, Ali is brought on as the junior council to defend the client.  Their attraction is instant and magnetic, and Ali, in a moment of self-sabotage, takes the step over the line from colleague to lover.Throughout the story we have several instances of Ali&#8217;s inability to follow through on her stated desire to make things work with Adam, and to stay away from Anthony, as she also is dealing with her desire to have a baby and her sister&#8217;s ongoing man issues.While it sounds as if I didn&#8217;t enjoy the story: I really did.  It completely displayed the many different factors that can contribute to the demise of a relationship, and the harm that assumptions and quick conclusions without all of the facts have on those little voices of disquiet that exist in everyone&#8217;s head.  Although a tad slow in the beginning, the story quickly builds on itself to add several interesting characters: some creepy, some reasonably menacing, and others that are just appearing and adding a bit of color as Ali comes to a new realization about her situation and her confusion.Emotionally, Ali starts the book as a petulant eighteen year old, yet quickly becomes the adult of almost thirty: with those revelations, realizations and mistakes that she is taking responsibility for, perhaps the first time in her life.  With her sister acting as confidante and even a bit of moral compass, both of these sisters show growth on their way to happy conclusions.Drama, intrigue, a creepy defendant and a few moral and ethical challenges are steppingstones to the highlight in this story: the romance and the relationships between Ali and Adam and Ali and Anthony.  Quick reading and unique, although one does see the potential pitfalls in the story ending well, this was a fun read that engages from start to finish.I received an eBook copy from the author for purpose of honest review for Tasty Book Tours. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.

$REVIEW.: Okay, I don't have this book yet, but I read some of it and really believe what Dr. Derry is saying is true.  I was having problems with being tired a lot as well as hair loss (I am talking a lot of hair and I am a woman).  Anyway, doctors told me I probably had low iron, but I had it tested and it was fine. One doctor even gave me thyroid meds, but after a week, my thyroid actually hurt and it didn't make me feel better.  I also went gluten free, but still was having hair loss issues.  I started taking iodine every day along with the vitamin D3 and Maca and my hair loss has really stopped.  I also stopped using regular shampoos as they seemed to burn my scalp and now I only use Dr. Bonner's shampoo. However, I am pretty sure that what Dr. Derry said is true, because it seemed to me that when I started the iodine. I slowly started to get better.  Thank you, Dr. Derry and now I am getting your book to find out more!update 1/11/13  I really found that going gluten free and taking probiotics as well as kelp has helped me.  I did get the book and found it very interesting.  I felt better taking the kelp than the liquid iodine.

$review_text.: I got this book because I asked some friends if I had an anger problem...everyone I asked started laughing and was like &#34;yes.  definitely yes.&#34;The good:This book helped me realize that I definitely have an anger problem.  I feel more anger than normal, I am angry more often and more intensely than most men.  Before I read this book I didn't really recognize that.  I thought I was just a &#34;real man&#34; and a lot of other guys were pussies.  So if you're not sure you have an anger problem, this book is probably a good read.The bad:The book made me angry.  I think the author's goal is to 1) help you identify and accept your anger problem and 2) make you realize it's a very real problem and convince you to deal with it.  But he he does this by trying to make you angry at yourself and your own anger.It's been a while since I've read this book (and I only made it 80% through), but I don't remember reading anything useful that actually helps you deal with your anger and overcome it.This is might be a good book to give to someone who has an anger problem but doesn't know it or won't admit it.  But if all you want is to get better, this book will only frustrate and anger you further.I've reached a point where I have to find help for anger.  I get so angry I can feel it trying to claw its way out of my chest.  It's physically painful.  Really small/minor things can trigger it.I'm still looking for book that actually helps.  I'm considering therapy.  I want to resolve this in 2014.

$REVIEW.: This was a wonderful close to a beautiful series of fairy tales. Jessica Day George is one of my favorite authors, and has never failed to impress me with her magic!Princess of the Silver Woods, while my least favorite of the series, still managed to win me over and earn a solid 5-star rating. It took elements of familiar tales and subtly tied them into the plot. It was interesting seeing how in each book, the fairy tale elements are approached differently. In Princess of the Midnight Ball, we see the curse of the 12 Dancing Princesses from an inside viewpoint, while in Princess of Glass we're seeing the story unfold from the outside. Now, in Princess of the Silver Woods, it's not as direct of a retelling, so you need to search deeper to see the underlying fairy tale.The characters, both old and new, were very memorable. The sisters relationships were very sweet. They each had their own struggles, but together they were strong enough to overcome their problems. Family relationships are practically nonexistent in YA, so it was nice to see such a strong family unit.Out of all of Jessica's books, these are the ones I recommend the most! They are absolutely magical, with brand new takes on familiar tales. They are excellently written, with a little sprinkle of mystery and romance that will make your hearts melt.

$review_text.: Sacred Secrets is a beautifully crafted book. It is told from the viewpoints of Jacody Ives, the alter ego of Gavin McAllister and Katie O'Connor, a woman rich in wealth and poor in health who receives a new heart from a mystery donor.As the two stories join themselves together, Ms Prather weaves in a gentle mysticism in a way that you could never doubt it was a normal part of life. It is the kind of book that, even if you put it down for some time through necessity, when you pick it up again - and you will - you instantly remember where you are in the story. It is a book that holds you in the telling to the very last word. I have already downloaded the sequel,The Gifts, A Jacody Ives Mystery (Jacody Ives Mysteries), and it's on the top of my 'to be read' list. That's the best recommendation you can have.

$REVIEW.: WOW!!! The title was totally misleading. There was nothing "sanctified" about the plot or characters. Terrell Hunter, Pastor, Journey Towards Christ Church (rename Journey Towards Hell Church), was nothing more than a pimp in a robe.  He prostituted himself with women and men; members stole money from the church; folk were being killed left and right; the Pastor had the church bombed with thousands of members present. He also knowingly spread HIV/AIDS to his partners.  Natalie Champion, the Pastor's Administrative Assistant, was scandalous, promiscuous,  knew everybody's secrets, and she sold information like she was selling drugs. It was hard getting through this book. It did, however, have an interesting ending and of course, there's a sequel.I do not consider this book Christian fiction. There is absolutely nothing "spiritual" or redeeming or believable about the story or characters.  Don't recommend this book or the sequel.

The author has a fun writing style, and puts a good twist on traditional space operas.The only things that bugged me were the occasional editing errors, usually misplaced or double words,  ir the wrong but correctly spelled word used.  It wasn't enough to turn me off though, and seeing as the writer and his brother did this in their spare time while working full time day jobs,  I forgive them.  Well that and the cheesy cover, but we all know not to judge a book by its cover.I have already baught the second book Admirals gambit,  and am loving it too.

$REVIEW.: This first volume in The Complete Peanuts was the one that I was most excited about. This is because it contains the earliest strips that were never reprinted anywhere else. When I was young I collected all the Fawcett Crest paperbacks. It confused me that the earliest of these contained strips from MORE PEANUTS- I mean there must have been a book called PEANUTS if there was a MORE PEANUTS, so why was it never reprinted? Turns out that such a book did exist (published in 1952) but for whatever reason it was never reprinted. Now, at last, I can read those strips- and so much more besides.There is a different feel to these early strips that is difficult to describe. Both the tone and the art was still in flux. Personally, I like them. There is both an innocence, and an edge, that differs from the perfected strip. The included essay calls Peanuts the first "Beat" strip. I never thought of it that way, but with the alienation, insecurity, and inferiority in the strip- not to mention intelligence- I would have to agree. However, I would not agree that these early strips reflect Eisenhower's America, as the same essay suggests- these strips cover 1950 to 52, and Eisenhower took office in 1953...Schulz just didn't create a comic strip- he created a world. Nor are his characters merely characters- to me at least they were friends. In a sense they still are.

$REVIEW.: A "must" read for all who are interested in what exactly it means to be enlightened, when one has completely lost all sense of being a separate ego.  An experienced meditator and devotee of Transcendental Meditation, along with total involvement with the TM organization, she eventually became disillusioned with the cruelty and hypocrisy ripe within the organization (isn't that the way it is with all organized religions and spiritual organizations?)and gave it all up.  At the time of her enlightenment, she had not been meditating for years.Poor Suzanne was terrified when this suddenly happened to her, out of the blue, while standing at a bus stop in Paris, 27 years old and 4 months pregnant.  Thus began 10 years of searching for the meaning of her experience, after which she finally met an enlightened therapist who was able to explain it to her and thus alleviate her fear...I can't imagine how she lived with that fear all those years.  Her therapist, Stephen Bodian, has written a wonderful account of awakening, entitled "Wake Up Now" -- I'm reading it now and love it."Collision..." is a fascinating account of Suzanne's life and I couldn't put it down...

$review_text.: First, let me say that I liked the book...although most of the detective work by the main character was really kind of stumbled upon. My real source of confusion lies in the books price: it's free. Which, I always thought was a ploy to get people to buy the author's other books...the issue here, however, is that the author has no other books. So imagine my surprise when I decided to browse (and maybe buy) another book from the author. I guess I just don't get giving the book away if it's not a a way to reel people in for other books.

$REVIEW.: I was searching for a good, concise read on improving my time management skills. This book definitely delivered. It was succinct and to the point with many practical time management tips. Some of the tips like the 80/20 rule (the book discusses) I knew about but there were also some other valuable nuggets of info that I was unaware of and can't wait to begin using. Overall a great read for the price.

$REVIEW.: The Space Between is about two people from two different social economic status and backgrounds. Lacy Douglas, half Caucasian and half African American is struggling financially to support and provide for her very ill mother. Truman Drake is Asian and adopted by a wealthy white family. Drake's father is a senator running for election.This book focus on Lacy and Drake who had instant attraction to each other. It showcases how they come from two different backgrounds and upbringings and yet they still strive to make their secret relationship work. In the end after so many obstacles that stood in their way, its about two people loving each other and not caring what society thinks. Lacy and Drake doesn't see color, race, or social/economic status but they see the love they have for each other."We both had something only the other could give, and I grew sick of fighting what I felt for him. Being together was right, and resisting it was stupid."I would give this book a 3.5 rating. Its a fresh breathe of air, to have a book focus on two multicultural individuals and their interracial relationship. It is also rare to have an Asian male lead character.

$REVIEW.: This book reminds me that cooking can be easy if I allow it to be.  When I am stressed out, but must produce a meal, this is where I turn.  I am bound to find some combination that I can throw into my dear crockpot when I leave for work and enjoy heartily when I return home.The crockpot allows for flavors to mingle, so classic stew combinations abound.  Although the book multiplies its recipes by making small variations from one recipe to the next, that helps me (in a brain-dead state) to select one.  Before I cook, I usually compare various recipes to pick the best for my purpose or preference.  The results from this book have been tasty.  My husband and I especially liked the enchilada beef recipe.Not only do I use this cookbook, but I gave a copy to my step-son, who needs simple recipes for survival.Guess what, you don't have to be a gourmet cook all the time!

$review_text.: An adventure in the dark side of archeology and ancient antiquities is to be enjoyed in Aileen G. Baron's new book The Gold of Thrace.Archeologist Tamar Saticoy is distressed to find that an ancient mosaic floor recently discovered at her dig site in Kilis, Turkey is missing.  The overnight theft of the valuable mosaic is a reeling blow as it follows closely on the heels of the recent Ephesus murder of one of her staff members.Determined to recover the mosaic before it reappears as a collector's prize, Tamar traces the mosaic to Basel, Switzerland. Posing as a museum curator looking for new articles for the museum, Tamar soon finds herself in the company of antiquities dealer Gilberto Dela Barcolo.Meanwhile one of Tamar's British colleagues, Chatham, is hot on the trail of a horde of ancient Thracian gold.  While traveling by train through Bulgaria he is approached by the gold's current owner and intrigued by images and pieces of the treasure.  Leaving the train, Chatham spends several days cataloguing the beautiful treasure in order that it might be displayed on loan at the British Museum.  Double crossed on his way to the museum, Chatham learns, too late, that all is not what it seems.When Chatham and one more staff member tracing the mosaic is murdered, Tamar also begins to realize that things and people are not always as they seem.  The murderer soon sets his sites on Tamar.  After several narrow escapes, it becomes apparent that she has entered a deadly game of cat and mouse where the huntress has now become the hunted.The Gold of Thrace is an entire novel of smoke and mirrors.  Few characters other than the heroine herself are what and who they initially appear to be.  Trying to unravel this mystery and its players is like following a single thread of a spider's web to it's origin.The Gold of Thrace flows along at a quick rate and its lightening fast climax does require careful reading if one does not want to be left scratching their head.  Understanding who is who is critical at this point as all is revealed and the smoke and shadows are quickly removed.This fast paced adventure is one difficult to put down.  Anyone with a passing interest in archeology and ancient history will enjoy this book and its long hard look at the black market of antiquities and the intrigue that surrounds it.

 Anyone who has lived in a small town will recognize the various characters that make "Hijack in Abstract" come alive
 The truck stop, the local Bar and Grill, and the various homes in and around town, all are known in most small towns


 Halo, GA, is no exception.And yes, there is mystery - as the title suggests, there is a hijacking; but what would a cozy mystery be without a murder or two

 Discovering who the victims are and their relationship to the culprits are a big part of this story
 As Henery Press' own publicity announces, the story has its twists and turns as Cherry Tucker, the local artist (the only real artist), makes her way through the clues.This is the first book that I have had the privilege of reading from this publisher, but I will look forward to reading more
 I already have received my second title from this publisher, but it also will not be my last.______________This review is based on a free electronic copy of this book provided by the publisher for the purpose of creating this review

$REVIEW.: Christoph FischerThe Black Eagle InnThe Three Nations Trilogy #3Before reading this trilogy, I had never put much thought into reading historical fiction but I can honestly say that since coming across this author I wouldn&#8217;t think twice about it now.  I have loved reading all three books, all for completely different reasons, and there&#8217;s no way I could choose a favourite in the trilogy.  This book went further than just covering the war era, as it carried on and showed how people were continually affected after 1945.  The author has a way of writing that completely draws you in, and the characters become real as the story unfolds.  Despite the heavy nature of the storyline, the book is easy to read and flows so smoothly that I soon found myself turning page after page.  I would highly recommend this trilogy.I was gifted an e-copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: 4 StarsIn book one we met Laurie and and Emma. That story focused more on Emma's background and life with Laurie throughout the storyline...In Book Two we are given the chance to find out more about Laurie and her struggles. How she came to Fairfield and fell in love with the town and it's people.We are given the chance to discover how Rob became her man...the guy she chose to live her life loving daily. In the beginning they struggled to get over his past. He was what you could call a Man Whore of sorts. He never committed and never spent the night with any woman after they hooked up. He would be on his way until he found the gorgeous girl in the grocery store. From that point on he was hooked and sunk. The way she made him feel there was no coming back from.He fell and fell hard right along with her.He helps her through a life changing struggle and stood by her side when she needed him most. Yes he messed up and yes they had troubles but the love they share help them strong and carried them through it all.It was great to have a little background into their story. In book one they were already together and you knew they were meant to be but having the story behind their love just makes them that much more lovable.

Eden has a fun sense of humor
Since many of her characters are present in her various books, it is entertaining to get to know, and love, the backstories of each and what makes them act the way they do

It may be a bit overly corny in some places, but for those who appreciate a clean, witty read with heartfelt stories and realistic characters (who deal with pains and difficulties as well), Drops of Gold will be a delight.

$REVIEW.: British author Bob Steele has given us an intriguing mystery/thriller with a fantasy twist.  A successful but quite ordinary commercial photographer, Peter Conway, stumbles onto a widespread conspiracy of rich and powerful people who are manipulating the British financial markets for immense personal gain.  Peter's life is immediately placed in great danger, because the conspirators ruthlessly silence (permanently with commando tactics) any and all persons who learn that they even exist.These lethal "spin-doctors" use psychological principles--not ordinary advertising or political propaganda--to control groups and to bend individuals to their will.  Thus their PR agency, Media Associates, is capable of making or breaking even the largest corporation, if there is someone willing to pay for their services.The spin-doctors apply secrets gleaned from the "Kaiserhof Archive", a collection of scientific studies out of WWII Germany that were focused on the physiological functioning of the human brain, and on methods of controlling human thought processes.  Data in the studies came from experiments on human beings.  Today, the Kaiserhof findings on how brains work at the cellular level enable the conspirators to control and manipulate, with scientific precision, the actions of high-ranking operators in the financial markets--operators who are totally unaware that they are being manipulated.To save his own life, Peter must bring down the conspiracy.  To do that, he must take terrible risks, and must stay ahead of the hired killers who are relentlessly pursuing him with the aid of unlimited access to advanced computer technology and to all existing computer databases.Not exactly a page-turner, SPIN nevertheless contains some truly exciting scenes, makes you care about the characters, and has a plot that unfolds in a way that keeps you reading.  The writing is polished, and the dialogue is handled well.  (U.S. readers should be warned that the story is set in Great Britain, and frequently uses British words that may be unfamiliar to them.)  The mildly fantastical ending will surprise some readers--at least it surprised me!  I rate this at 4 stars,  as a well-written and enjoyable read for mystery/thriller fans.(This review is based on a complimentary review copy provided to me by the publisher at no charge.)

$REVIEW.: This is the third book in the Vegas Series and I have read them all. How could I not? Aurora and Kai are great characters and their "love" story draws you back for more.  In Vegas Shuffle, Aurora is forced to deal with the very real possibility that Kai won't return.  Aurora agonizes over the hard decision she made that Kai considered a betrayal. Knowing she did what she had to do is a small, lonely comfort. Aurora goes about her business, as tough and competent as ever. She even accepts, with appropriate "eye rolls", a new partner.  How else can you deal with a gorgeous woman who never stops talking and is cheerful in the morning?  It takes an unwitting guy--Jeff--to jerk Aurora back to her senses and acknowledge the truth. AND to reach out to Kai and tell him to get the heck back where he belongs.  I can hardly wait to see his response. Bring on High Stakes Vegas - and hurry!

Therefore I was pleased to see Shelley Hintz and Heather Heart had published a new book. The information is worth much more than the small price I paid for it.I have learned that these women want to give back.

Not only was it incredibly easy to read, but it had tips and ideas that can apply to anyone.  I've never really sat and thought about how the Europeans live in comparison to how Americans but some of the differences are startling.  I won't divulge any of the book but I will say that I plan to incorporate more than a few of them into my daily life.  I plan to go back and re-read this book again, making notes of the things that really speak to me.  I also plan to give everyone on my 2006 Christmas list a copy to read for themselves.

$review_text.: While Peter Reinhart seems to be a bubee, his book, Crust and Crumb, comes across as mishegoss. Although he has spent much of his career as an academic rather than a baker, in this book Prof. Reinhart does not teach very confidently, particularly to an inexperienced breadmaker. His so-called "master formulas" might work in the master's hands and the master's kitchen, but without interpretation they might not in yours or mine.Most recipes in the book are heavily elaborated in both ingredients and techniques, but they lack clear explanations, so that the themes and variations become obscure for readers who are not already thoroughly familiar with making the different types of bread. Those who are will find a wealth of suggestions for new approaches to otherwise familiar breads. That is the book's main appeal and its charm.A particular problem for everyone reading this book will be Prof. Reinhart's frequent use of refrigeration to retard rising. He does not seem aware that when using wild yeast cultures such an approach tends to encourage growth of the wild yeasts over growth of lactobacilli, altering the tastes that would otherwise be achieved. Specific directions are often unreliable, because they do not account for ambient temperatures, batch sizes and types of containers--all of which influence rising times.Most readers seeking to improve skills at making bread will do better with the now classic work by Joe Ortiz, The Village Baker [Ten Speed Press, 1993], and the more recent and detailed work by Jeffrey Hamelman, Bread [Wiley, 2004, second edition 2012]. Once the skills and recipes in those works have become second nature, then the twists and the odd bits of history found in Crust and Crumb may be of interest.

$REVIEW.: I love Kathleen Delaney's Ellen McKenzie Mystery series! I finished reading &#34;Murder by Syllabub&#34; last night. I enjoyed trying to figure out who the killer was and, although I had my suspicions, I wasn't sure until the very end. Great plot! Wonderful characters! I highly recommend this book and the others in the series.

$review_text.: This here... now THIS is a graphic novel.  I have been carrying this book around with me, I've read it about 3 times now and know I will read it over and over for a long time, if not forever.  This isn't to say it's perfect, but it is THAT good.The story is at the same time a fun action/adventure story and a deep, meaningful tale about much bigger things than alien invasions.  This is TenNapel's best art yet.  His art in Tommysaurus Rex annoyed me at times with how rushed it looked, as did Gear- even though both remain books I have mucho respect for.  The art in Earthboy Jacobus is strong, sharp, and shows Doug's skills both in rendering and in story.If you know TenNapel's work, Creatue Tech was, for me, one of the  single most inspiring books I have ever owned.  This book ranks right along side it.  Everything from the depth of story, to the characters and the creature designs is something you can't just take in once.  It's good thick book, both in story and in page count.My criticsms of the book are minor and almost not worth mentioning.  There are a few pieces of the story that seem either rushed, or forced.  But I have found that each time I read this book the pieces fit together better and the story gets even more satisfying.I highly reccomend this book.  I bought two, and plan on buying more for some friends who don't read graphic novels much.  TenNapel's work is perfect for introducing newbies into the world of Graphic novels, and at the same time one of the stringest contenders in the genre.Thanks to Doug for dumping so much work and heart into this book.  In his position, he could have just made a simple, quick, 60 page fun-book and still seen some real success (maybe even more).  But he chooses to dump himself into his work, which is highly inspiring.-eef

$review_text.: This review originally appeared on my blog, which can be found on my site at [...].I guess I'm a little cynical.  I lost faith in the short story?  Did I?  Is that it?  When I read, I'm hopeful.  And, despite my faithlessness, I am sometimes surprised.Let's see.  I bought their books after reading Richard Russo's "Horseman," Roy Kesey's "Wait," Nathan Englander's "How We Avenged the Blums," and William Gay's, "Where Will You Go When Your Skin Cannot Contain You?"  Lorrie Moore has been pretty influential.  Kyle Minor gave me a Flannery O'Connor epiphany with "A Day Meant to Do Less."  And I'm still in love with Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried.Sometimes I hold the stories up to my own fierce literary theories about the redemptive end (see my essay on "Lost," which is out there somewhere).  Sometimes I read stuff and just forget about it.  But sometimes I read something and take notes.Okay, let's not call me "cynical."  Let's use "eclectic" instead.So I just finished Benjamin Percy's Refresh, Refresh.This is one of the good ones.  I'm not sure it really meets my whole redemptive-end-standards, but these are good stories with meaning and resolution.  They're also fairly, hmm, masculine.  I can tell a guy wrote them.  I hope that's okay to say.  I know I don't like when people say that I write for women (I don't!)--but I'm okay if you say I write like a girl.  These are stories written by a guy, though they're not enmeshed in that Hemingway macho stuff. There is, however, a fair amount of hunting and fishing.But, ultimately, they're stories for men and women.  Perhaps they deal with a universal concern.  They ask, if you will, the secularized version of the question posed by theologian Francis Schaeffer, "How shall we then live?"  Soldiers return home from Iraq.  How shall we then live?  Marriages sour.  How shall we then live?  A car crash kills.  How shall we then live?  A father abandons his family.  How shall we then live?I liked most of the stories, but my favorites were "The Caves of Oregon," "Meltdown," and "Crash."  "The Caves of Oregon" plays a little, maybe, with Camus' "Allegory of the Cave" (okay, I'm probably making this up)--but I like stories about marriages that contain the sweetness and the pitfalls of commitment.  Good marriage stories are kinda rare.  "Meltdown" reminded me a little of The Road by Cormac McCarthy, and a little of The Road Warrior, the movie (Mel Gibson, circa my late childhood).  But there were things in this story that weren't in The Road--and their absence in The Road always bugged me!  This story had context!  A reason for its apocalyptic reality!  The protagonist had a history!  That is serious cause for celebration!  And then "Crash."  (Yeah, I have my own car crash story.)  I liked this for a number of reasons.  Part of it has to do with marriage again.  The protagonist is destroyed over the death of his wife; however, it wasn't a marriage or a life he dreamed about.  He married the high school girlfriend because she was pregnant.  He didn't go out into the world to study international politics.  He didn't live in a big, beautiful house.  He lived with his wife and kid in a trailer by his parents' farm, where he worked too.  And, yet, this death--the death of his wife--devastates him.  She was his wife nonetheless.  I also like the way the protagonist talks to his daughter, and the way he has a moment of shame because his groceries do not include soymilk.  But, again, a central theme is a line in the story:  "Here is my life."Oh, did I mention these stories mostly take place in Oregon?  Which is refreshing, pun slightly intended, because most stories these days seem pretty East Coastish--even my own.  Unless we're talking Annie Proulx, but we're not.I'll read more Benjamin Percy.  I think they're making a movie of his novel?

$REVIEW.: In the second installation of the "Knightfall" series, Jean Paul Valley, or Azrael, takes over for Batman.  This book focuses mainly on that transition of Azrael into the Batman role.  However, the storyline that I craved, namely a detailed account of Bruce's recovery from his broken back, was sidetracked.  Only now do I know that this story arc occurs in something called "Knightquest."However, this volume still holds its own in several ways.  The relationship between Tim Drake and Azrael shows an important aspect of the Robin character.  Since the beginning, Robin has been the voice of reason, the light in darkness, to ensure that the Batman did not go too far or become too obsessed.  Robin almost functions as an extra "conscience" for Batman.  I disagree that he functions as THE conscience, because Bruce Wayne is at heart a compassionate man.  However, Robin is an important part of the team.When the new Batman simply spurns the role of Robin, red flags pop up immediately.  When even Bane runs in terror from the new Batman, it becomes clear Azrael has gone too far.  However, this book does raise the question of "escalation."  Will the bad guys cross a line that the good guys will not in order to ensure victory?  The cops get guns, crooks get automatics.  Cops get automatics, crooks get rocket launchers.  Cops get armor, crooks get armor piercing capabilities.  What line, how far, must Batman go to take Gotham back?  That is the central question of "Batman:  Who rules the Night."

$REVIEW.: As a female in recovery, I find the AA Big Book very archaic. Working with an AA sponsor has not worked for me at all. I do not like the holier-than-thou attitudes and how women treat each other in Alcoholics Anonymous. It is very condescending of how everything bad that has happened in life is something "we had a part in" even if it is regarding a crime committed against us or domestic violence in the home. I find AA sponsorship with women tend to have the dynamics of another woman yelling at me and telling me how to live when their own lives are messed up.I fired my last sponsor and put the AA books away. I still go to meetings and get a lot out of the fellowship of other recovering people. However, working the steps with this workbook and the first book, "A Woman's Way Through the Steps," has been very liberating. The material is geared for females of today's society rather than the drunks of the 1930's. This is a kinder way to work the Steps and through my issues without someone with no real qualifications to act as a counsellor to "work the Steps with me in AA". Men would also benefit from a book of this sort for males as - again- the issues have changed so much since the Thirties and today's men AND women have different needs.

$REVIEW.: Great start and very good leading characters. A positive story with a good vibe. Thank God! For once the lead female character wasn't an Amazon. I have nothing against tall people I married one but everyone can't be almost six feet and almond skinned. This was a woman under 5' 5" and her skin was dark brown. I know as an African American that we come in all shades but a lot of the writers have gone away from that and now a majority of today's IR titles are with mocha or almond complexion ladies. The male is sweet and fine. I wish there was a bit more description about him but I'll wait to see what the author does in her next book on these two characters.

$REVIEW.: Historically, America's Test Kitchen's greatest strength has been taking classic dishes and using exhaustive, repetitious, experimentation to absolutely NAIL the recipe and technique needed create the best possible version of that dish. The results have always been, very, very, good recipes that were nearly fool-proof to execute. The down-side was that sometimes their recipes could require multiple "procedures" making them somewhat complicated and time consuming to create. This book totally fixes that issue. Each of the 750 recipes in this book can be made in 45 minutes or less from start to finish, including prep time.Impressively, the book doesn't seem to realize the time savings, by "dumbing down" the recipes, but instead by careful selection and judicious use of ingredients. The recipe for Baked Stuffed Mushrooms on page 26 is a perfect example, combining careful selection of the "correct" sized mushrooms (not so small that they're hard to work with, but not too big to be one-bite appetizers), par-cooking them in the microwave (putting coffee filters under them to absorb excess moisture so they don't get soggy!), using Boursin Cheese topped with pieces of Prosciutto to eliminate much of the time consuming prep-work of preparing the filling, and final cooking in the oven to heat the filling and crisp the Prosciutto. The result is an excellent appetizer that takes only 40 minutes.Another excellent feature of the book is the "Getting Started" section, where a fairly comprehensive list of basic kitchen equipment is provided including specific recommendations for brand and model from their "Cooks Illustrated" magazine, which is kind of "Consumer Reports" for kitchen gear. I've subscribed to Cooks Illustrated for a couple of years and never been misled by one of their recommendations. I recommend this book very highly to anyone who wants to create good, flavorful, home cooked food, but doesn't have a lot of time. This would be a particularly fine gift for anyone just starting out on their own.

This book was right up there with the best of them


Mark Langley, the protagonist, was a very likeable, compassionate man who saw his clients as more than just a billable hour

I had never heard of a "tenant" lawyer before this book but I was quickly drawn into the degrading difficulties, and injustices, that some tenants have to face


The book is well-written and the legal tactics fascinating

I wouldn't hesitate to read another book by this author and I hope he will continue to write more.

In the beginning I was reading every book I could find (I have gotten more selective nowadays). I honestly believe that this book is packed with solid advice and I would save a lot of time and energy if I had it when I started changing my nutriotional habits. I found many things on Chapter 4 that I have already implemented in my daily routine. I also picked up a few things and I am going to start implementing them.

A lot!I absolutely love Jared! I was so happy I felt like doing a fairy dance after reading this book
It was just great!Jared you just became my new book boyfriend!Just so you know, my smile reaches my ears while typing this
I just can't stop smiling when I think of Jared

Lol!The warriors are back in the 2nd book of the series


Still funny and adorable as ever


With new characters to love


And as usual the author did a really excellent job writing this book.This time our main hero is Jared
I loved Jared in Damon's book


And now I'm hopelessly in love with him! Who wouldn't be? He's just the perfect hero of my book dreams.Just as much as I loved Nicole in the first book, I'm also loving Tessa here
She's perfect! Gorgeous, funny, sassy, and foul mouthed just the way I like my heroine; although a bit insecure.Plotwise, Jared's book is way better than the Damon's
The story is more interesting and definitely original
More action and violence here

I love it when the warriors go badass


They're so sexy and really hot
Lol!Romance-wise, I think Damon's is still hotter


Damon and Nicole really made some steamy scenes


Jared and Tessa's scenes are tamer, but still sexy
I especially liked their first meeting


For a guy like Jared, that's just a perfect way to meet his match

A girl who can take him down lol.Aside from the hero and heroine, I like Sid and Adam's characters too
I don't know what happened to Sid but his character kind of changed from the first book

Not that I'm complaining, but he's funnier and more foolish in this book
Adam, on the other hand, is a nice guy


He's more serious than the warriors but still funny, too


I really like his attitude and how he protects his sister


I hope he gets to have his own book, too.Overall, this is 5 stars for me! I can't wait to read Duncan's book


Again, this book doesn't have a cliffhanger for Jared and Tessa

But it sure did leave a hell of a teaser for the next book
And I CAN'T WAIT TO READ DUNCAN'S BOOK!I would definitely recommend this to anyone ages 16 and above
Even if you're not a fan of Paranormal Romance, try this series! I'm pretty sure you would be after reading this.

$review_text.: Capital punishment was ended in England in the mid-sixties and even when practiced the hanging of a woman was closely followed. Most women were convicted and sentenced for murdering their husbands and the heroine of The Second-Last Woman in England is no exception, the prologue informs us that Harriet Wallis shot her husband in front of witnesses on Coronation Day in 1953. The question is why and Maggie Joel's closely observed mystery is in the manners and details of the why.Harriet Wallis is a conventional upper middle class English woman, married to a respectable officer of a shipping company, with two children and a need for a new nanny in these hard-pressed times of rationing. On the surface, everything is as it should be, but family life is rarely that placid and the Wallis's have secrets and secret duties to those they love. The Second-Last Woman in Englang examines what happens when those passionate emotions come to the surface after being suppressed so rigidly.The period detail is wonderful, not just in the descriptions of a country finallly recovering from war and rationing and in the descriptions of the Coronation preparations, but in the rigid social conventions that desptie the changes the war had brought were still stifling. The writing is smooth and top-notch with odd little bits of modern humor that wink pleasantly at the reader. And then there is the motive and the red herring. The motive is original as is the red herring, the reader sees none of it coming. With all of that said though the book is solid rather than spectacular, like the protagonists there is something missing in the feeling. The reader never feels the loyalties that give the motive for murder, even though they are clear and understood. Recommended for die-hard fans of the genteel British mystery and those who love to read of the upper English classes misbehaving. A-/B+.

$REVIEW.: After having read the earlier installments, I couldn't wait to read this "final" entry. As other reviewers have noted, although the editing in the previous works was practically flawless, this book left something to be desired in that regard. (What can I say? When presented with near perfection more than once, ya come to expect it.) That said, the story itself was very good. I won't say "excellent" simply because Meredith was the diary's "voice" once again and she is... well, Meredith. As an eternal optimist, I soooo wanted her to exhibit some personal growth and not continue blindly toward her quest of reaching Las Vegas. (WARNING: potential spoiler alert.) Suffice it to say the book reached its logical conclusion since she remained in charge of her own destiny. (How someone who was really always self-reliant on others thought she was such a bad ass is beyond me. *sigh*) Anyway, I really liked all the characters in these books and wanted some happy endings (yes, even in a world full of zombies ~ or, perhaps for precisely that reason!). That said, the book's ending was the perfect segue for future sequels. I look forward to reading more of this wonderful author's work, and trust the editing will return to its original excellent standard. Thanks for another good read, TW!

$REVIEW.: Don't let Claire fool you she might be shy but when she's upset she's a pi**er, &#34;I didn't buy it. I inherited it from my uncle, and it's not for sale.&#34; Her words were clipped, and the anger emanated from her in waves that almost shimmered.&#34; Max is someone who wears his feelings and heart on his arm, &#34;stung, he mumbled a curse before turning to leave. Before reaching the hedges, he stopped and tossed over his shoulder. &#34;Get some effing curtains on your bedroom window.&#34; He's also very protective of his woman and doesn't want others to see her in a certain state, which made for a very entertaining conversation for me:&#34;So, you don't have a bra on, for Christ's sake, and that tee shirt is completely see-through, showing off your astonishing ti*s to the entire neighborhood.&#34;&#34;Max! This is my house! This is my delivery! This is my damn neighborhood! If I want to answer the house in the nude, I will do it. I will do what I want to in my own house!&#34; She was yelling at him, and as much as he liked it, he knew he needed to tread carefully.&#34;I enjoyed reading this story, it was entertaining and I loved it.

$review_text.: *I received an ARC in exchange for my honest review.*This was my first book by Dawn Pendleton and it was a good story. Mallory couldn't wait to get out of her small home town and move to Boston. Her mother had felt suffocated in their town and left her and her father when she was only months old. So Mallory came to lean on her Dad for everything. For fear of Mallory sharing her mother's feeling her dad convinces Mallory to move away and experience life. Of course she is unaware that her father is hiding something. So with Mallory's sights set on Boston it's decision time for her boyfriend Luke, does he stay in the small town he wants to grow old in or does he follow his love and live in the city. They do say young love doesn't last forever so it's with  heavy hearts that they decide to go their separate ways.Three years later Mallory is forced to return home and face all the things she left behind. Mallory was convince the big city was for her but the longer she stayed at home the more she realised how much she really did miss it and of course there was the reappearance of  Luke. It was clear to see early on that both Luke and Mallory had unfinished business. The story was told in dual pov so you got to know Luke as well as Mallory. I have to say I enjoyed Luke's POV as he was the sweetest guy and really wanted the best for Mallory and it was clear he never stopped loving her.Mallory reconnected with her best friends Rainey and Gabby, they too had complicated love lives in the form of Baker and Wolfe respectively. It was fun to see the girls catch up and just gossip about their lives and the boys. I could relate to the girls' easy friendship, it was like no time had passed between them. Unfortunately tragedy was ahead for Mallory and I was glad she had her friends and Luke surrounding her.I really liked the plot and felt it had a lot of  potential, I would have just loved more character depth so I could really connect with Mallory. She did make changes towards the end and I'm glad she started thinking of what Luke wanted as well and what he was giving up for her. Any scene between Mallory and her dad was heart warming and the same can be said of her dad and Luke. The letter Luke received from him was the sweetest (and yes I did tear up ;))I loved the eclectic group of characters, and I am looking forward to reading their books. Of course we were left hanging at the end as Rainey had a big secret so I can't wait to find out what it is.This was a quick, sweet read. Lovers of New Adult will enjoy this in one sitting. It is currently free for the month of July and I say it's well worth a read! ~Ava

$review_text.: I'd like to believe that the problem I had with this book is not with the writer, but with the publisher


They say 1st impressions matter, & you don't get a 2nd shot at it


I bought this book on the strength of its 5 star review recommendations


So, if you're looking for a "how to" book on writing, strictly from a "quality of exposition on the craft" perspective, then this is a definite recommend


It gives you not only the nuts & bolts of the writing process, but also an "I can do this" feel
That said, I'll have to stress at this juncture that the book "visually" is no eye candy
Yes, it's just not visually reader friendly


And because of that, I'll knock off a star on my rating


This, is one area I hope the author will have addressed in its next print edition.

$review_text.: A Shot in the Darkby Christine d'AboPublished 11/07/2011Carina PressRATING: 3 StarsA Shot in the Dark is book two in the Long Shot series that brings us the story of the oldest sister, Paige Long. Once again we are invited to visit their Toronto coffee shop and in to the alternative sexual lifestyles at Mavericks.Paige is a no nonsense business owner. After leaving an abusive relationship, the last think on her mind is finding someone new. But when hunky firefighter, Carter West, stops by the coffee shop, Paige feels the sturrings of arousal from this handsome stranger.I liked this book, but felt uncomfortable with the BDSM element of it. Carter was definitely a gentleman with how far he chose to push Paige outside her comfort zone, yet because she had a history of abuse I could not help but think that some of the domination seemed a little harsh. However, the story came together quickly and provided enough background to make the relationship work. I felt myself wishing for a little more detail but as far as a short story goes, the story was satisfying.The final book of this trilogy is Ian's story. After two books of teasers, we will soon find out what becomes of Ian and Blue Eyes.

$REVIEW.: Selection Event, by Wayne Wightman, is the story of Martin, and his dog Ishi. Martin was in isolation when the Mongolian Influenza Virus hit, and civilization collapsed. Ishi was abandoned at his home when his parents left to die, knowing that Martin would be back for her. Together they explore the New America, where giraffes and hippos roam through suburbia and all the rules of the old world are trampled on by the desperation of life.Selection Event was a great book, with a tight plot that moves along at a comfortable clip, despite the fact that the cast of characters grows throughout the progress of the novel. Martin's character development in his new place in society is believable and compelling. The flashbacks to characters from Martin's past really bring the events of the plague to life, without making the book about the plague. This book is not about the plague, it's about the aftermath, and the book knows that.A couple problems that I have are that the bad guys are ridiculously bad. I knew that this was going to be a problem when we met our first round of bad guys. Some head honcho who controls his minions with heroin, coercion and racism. Oh, and he rapes women, and it's suggested that he also murders children. Yes, Wightman, I get it. He's a bad man.There's also some other problems I have with every person who expresses religious beliefs being insane, or evil. If you happen to get religion, you begin to go insane and begin to do bad things. That was a little disconcerting for a reasonable, reasoning Christian, but I'll give it a pass because hey, what other fundamentalists are you going to find in post-apocalyptic America?I thought that bi-polar disorder was demonstrated really positively, if dramatically, in Diaz. He plays the part of the catalyst in the book. He doesn't change, he simply is, like a force of nature, and sends people to Martin, people to help him and people to challenge him, while he deals with the repercussions of his own untreated bi-polar the only way he knows how, with frenetic movement.
$SUMMARY.: Loved this one.

$review_text.: I am always fascinated and excited when I get a chance to read a debut novel. Will it be good? Will it be great?  Or will it be just another run of the mill yarn?Knowing this is being published by my good friends over at DarkFuse I had very high expectations for this. Were my expectations met? More and then some I am happy to say.I would hazard to guess that you will be hearing a lot more about Kristin Dearborn in the future. With "Trinity" she was able to take an age old premiss (no spoilers) and put her own fresh spin on it that really kept me riveted to the storyline.The characters are wonderfully developed and believable. I came to care about them and what they were going through, especially the main character Val. I thought she did an absolutely splendid job with him.The action is fast paced, and the story grabs you right from the first page. I especially enjoyed how Kristin kept slowly revealing information about what was going on without revealing too much keeping me riveted and guessing. Though I felt that the story did drag for me in a few spots, but not enough to take away from the overall pace or quality of the tale.If you love discovering new authors, especially talented one's like Kristin you have to read her debut novel "Trinity" and I highly recommend it

$REVIEW.: Ravi Kishore has presented the public with one of the most innovative, creative, simple, environmentally safe, and economical methods of cleaning everything in your house and everything around it
 He doesn't spend a lot of time preaching about the importance of protecting the environment; he simply gets right down to the ways we can all protect it by following his very astute examples

For starters he lists the many things we should all keep in our pantry for general use either alone or in some of his suggested potions and mixtures
 And the list itself sets the tone for just how economical and simple his approach is
The Top Cleaning Products we MUST have include white vinegar, salt, hydrogen peroxide, borax, toothpaste, lemons, castile soap, cornstarch, essential oils, baking soda and washing soda, but he quickly adds the surprises - tea, club soda, coffee grounds, white rice, ketchup, white bread, rubbing alcohol, olive oil

He warns AGAINST the use of ammonia, bleach, formaldehyde, petroleum distillates, hydrochloric acid, cresols, ethyl benzene, morpholine, xylene, and sodium dichloroisocyanurate!After listing all the tools we need he begins his book with how to kill ants, then moves on to kitchen cleaners, bathroom cleaners, bedroom cleaners, cleaners for floors, laundry, wood, furniture, metal, windows, disinfectants and antibacterial solutions, mold and mildew removers, dog cleansers, toy cleaners, and more - all made from the list of simple, inexpensive SAFE products listed above.He takes us through every step for preparing the solutions, applications and the whole job for every room in the house
His writing is so clear that it is very easy to follow his instructions and the results - after trying several of these more `far out' techniques -  are very positive

The reader will be amazed at the spectrum of stains and cleaning ideas that are packed in this completely indispensible book! Highly recommended

$REVIEW.: Lost and Found may be the best ghost story I've ever read. Not that I read a lot of ghost stories, but the ones I have read have all been pretty typical. This one is far from typical. So far from typical that you don't know... Um, wait... I want this to be as spoiler free as possible and saying that this is a ghost story is almost a spoiler all by itself.Okay, so let's start with the technicals. Bryan and Brandon continue to deliver the best edited independent books that I've read. I think I counted, maybe, three typos. Not that I was counting, because I wasn't, but the lack of errors made the ones I did see kind of jump out at me. But it may have only been two. Few enough as to not be worthy of commenting on. I know, then why am I commenting on it? Well, the traditionally published book I am currently reading (you know, the one with a budget to hire professional editors) has already have three or four times as many errors, so I think it's worth noting that these guys do a better job of polishing their work than the &#34;professionals.&#34;Okay, so back to the story:The story is told in two parts: &#34;Lost&#34; and &#34;Found.&#34; Both stories are completely independent of each other in that you could sit down and read either of them and come away from whichever one you'd read and think, &#34;Well, that was pretty good. Not spectacular but pretty good.&#34; However (and this is a big &#34;however&#34;), when you put the two stories together, they interlock and are spectacular. Seriously. And I wish I could talk about it, but that would be the spoiling part.So let's call Lost and Found a psychological thriller with a paranormal twist, which still doesn't cover it, but it's probably as close as I can get. It's creepy, maybe scary, but not gruesome in any way. It has a little bit of Ghost Whisper and a little bit of... um, I'm not sure... some kind of reality hunter type show. You should probably just go read it. Yeah, you should probably go do that right now.

$REVIEW.: IMHO this book is stuffed with filler and light on content and examples. I'd say 2/3 of the words in the book are dedicated to establishing the authors voice, and setting a friendly tone instead of creating example projects. Depending on you comfort level with interfaces, and programing that may be fine with you, but to me it felt like a waste of time and kind of condescending. Perhaps i should have gleaned this approach from the words "Beginners Guide" in the title. It is certainly a book for extreme beginners, at times it feels like it was written for someone who has never used a computer at all, instead of being written for someone new to Unity.

$REVIEW.: Ludwig, Emil


Napoleon (New York: Pocket Books, Cardinal edition, 1956, tr.).One day, while staying in a 2-star hotel in Lima, Peru, in 2013, I found this book on a shelf thus satisfying my long term desire to read the Corsican&#8217;s biography


When new in the U.S
the soft back copy I found cost 50 cents so the spine was damaged already allowing pages to come loose
I exchanged it for a different but newer book and bound it with a rubber band to hold it together until I finished reading it.I had already perused Ludwig&#8217;s biography of Beethoven wherein I discovered that the peak of Ludwig&#8217;s writing, mostly biographical, occurred in the late 1940s-early 1950s
This explained his writing style to me which I would simply call old fashioned but based on voluminous research mostly of letters and other contemporary material as both of these celebrated men left behind heaping mounds of letters they wrote and other documents related to their lives.I had wanted to read more about Napoleon Bonaparte because I had previously learned, what few modern day Americans discover, unfortunately, of his vital role in modern Western history, one of great consequence, I would add


 Thanks to the mountains of documents Ludwig&#8217;s worked with, he filled in the details for me but I consequently found it necessary to skim at times always making sure I picked up my in-depth reading at the right moment.The core of what I learned is that Napoleon was a gifted man whose indefatigable mind and body, physically short as he was, drove him forward dragging hundreds of thousands of men behind him into battle in his effort to crush the idea of monarchy fused to its structures of extravagance yet, paradoxically, he became the most famous European ruler of all time


 I also learned that Napoleon was the first European leader to idealize a united non-monarchical Europe.Despite the dowdiness of his writing I concluded that Ludwig succeeded in explaining to me, the reader, among other things, how Napoleon was gifted, how he was able to lead legions of men forward, how and why he hated blue bloods, how he overcame one kingdom after another, and how he finally ended his days on his island exile at the hand of the malicious British, who never forgave him for his deep-seated detestation of the idea of nobility.

$review_text.: It's amazing. This is one of the funniest flicks I've ever seen--though definitely a guy flick, or as Goodman calls it, "a buddy flick." It didn't do terribly well at the box office but has developed a real cult following. And the authors of this volume sponsor "Lebowski fests" all over the country.Why a guy flick? Well, the only positive comment I've heard from a woman--aside from a few they interviewed for the book--is that the wife of someone I talked with said she really likes one quote. And quotes there are! The authors interview fans all over the place and each has his or her favorite quote. (I have one too, thought it's not something Amazon.com would be likely to include on this page.)_What do you want, interviews with the stars? Even the guy who played Larry, or the clerk in the Ralph's store? Interviews, yes, with fans? Interviews with those on whom the story is allegedly based? A detailed, second-by-second breakdown of the film's activities? This has 'em all.Now, don't get it for someone who didn't like the film. It'll be burned at the stake--or wherever--in a heartbeat. But for the Lebowskifile, it's a work of art. (Indeed, I'm sending my copy to a good friend who introduced me to this flick. He'll never forgive me...Enjoy it!

$REVIEW.: COLD BLOODED by Bernard Lee Deleo is a masterpiece loaded with intricate detail and overflows with action, suspense and humor
The main characters are on the run and fighting for their lives.Rachel Hunter witnessed her husband being murdered a year ago and since then, her and her 7 year old daughter, Jean, are in the Witness Protection Program (Witsec)

Rachel works as a waitress, and is at work when she first meets Nick McCarthy, a New York Best Selling Author of an Assassin book series

However, his writing is a cover for his real profession, an Assassin
His next assignment - take out Rachel Hunter, but Nick can't do it, and instead, helps protect Rachel and her daughter in what becomes a cross-country killing spree to eliminate the people who ordered her hit.The author created very lovable characters and wrote a fast-paced adventure that is packed with cliffhangers and even humor

There were times I was chewing my knuckles and other times I had to pause reading as I was laughing so much


You will love Nick, Rachel and Jean, and even their dog, Deke.A wonderful storyline and well-written


I highly recommend this book and wish that I could give it more than 5 stars.

$review_text.: This is an okay collection of advent readings. Disclosure: I just really don't like Wilson's writing style. Half of his quips and attempts at being clever just fall flat. They come off as so forced that it throws me out of the paragraph or sentence to roll my eyes and sigh before I move on. I'm willing to admit that may be a problem with this reader...That being said, like with most of Wilson's books, there is wisdom here. You've just got to wade through a lot of other stuff to get to it. I thought his commentary on seasons in the life of the church was insightful, and it set the tone for the rest of the book's focus on advent as a season of celebration. His focus on the sabbath rest as a weekly celebration was likewise helpful, as was his discussion of the incarnation. Much of the practical application of this - what to do in the home, gifts, etc. - was wasted space in my opinion, as most readers are capable of drawing those conclusions on their own. I would have liked to see more of the church history and theological basis of advent celebration. I'm capable of drawing the lines on my own.

$REVIEW.: 3.5 starsThis was a fun read! It is about a Were Boa... yeah, and not only that, there are Were Elephants, Raccoons, Scorpions, Anacondas, Spider Monkeys, Cougars and I am probably missing something. And the cool thing is, it leans more towards campy rather than cheesy.Jeff is a Were Boa who just came out of a physically abusive relationship. His life is pretty good right now. He works at a book store with his best friend Kim, and has a great relationship with his family (they are all snake shifters). He has been fantasizing about a tall dark and sexy man that has been coming into the bookstore for a couple of weeks now. Jeff and Kim have given him the nickname "Eggplant" because it looks like he is smuggling one in his pants *g*. This story is full of stuff like this. Anyway, turns out Eggplant is a Werewolf named Brad and he has decided Jeff is his mate. This would be great except Wolves and Snakes don't get along, at all. Most Wolves look down on all other shifters. And now someone is turning snake shifters into accessories!The plot is kind of predictable and not very complex and the writing is straight forward and tight, but I didn't mind. What made this story for me was the humor - even though...read the rest of the review: [...]

$REVIEW.: Eventide by Cindy Martinusen is the emotional story of the ending of a life.  Carrie is not an old woman, but she has experienced many wonderful times in her life.  Now as a rare disease is shortening her days, her best friend, Lauren, has set out to bring Carrie one of the few things that Carrie was never able to do - retrieving a box buried in Italy years ago.  The mystery surrounding the box is from a summer long ago when Carrie and Lauren were young and Carrie experienced her first love. Though the relationship ended tragically, Carrie moved on, married and had a child. Now as Carrie knows her days are limited, she struggles with memories of that summer and seeks closure.  It will take a miracle of grace to bring together Carrie, her family, her friend and her first love.  Will her miracle happen or will all the difficulties of the situation prevail?This mystery aspect of this book kept drawing me to it, and I think the plot was well-designed. However, I found this book to be depressing. Perhaps it was because the entire plot was based around the death of a woman.  I would recommend this book to people who like mystery, but do not mind reading about death.

Scare Crow was there&#8230; Thank you Baby Jesus&#8230;If you&#8217;re anything like me you&#8217;ve already ready the synopsis and detail summary&#8217;s from other blogs and have a general understanding of the book.  The only thing that I will add is that as much as you loved Cameron and Emmy in Crow&#8217;s Row you will without a double be blown away by them in Scare Crow.  It&#8217;s not a love story with an HEA and all the crap, it&#8217;s real, and it&#8217;s heartbreaking at time and extremely frustrating at others but all and all one hell of a read.Things I loved about this book&#8230;.I love that Emmy didn&#8217;t curl up in a ball forever and that she decided to fight back.I loved that they brought Griff back to her. {Sorry}I&#8217;m torn. As messed up as the situation, is I kind of like Griff for Emmy, don&#8217;t get me wrong I love Cameron and hope like hell he gets his act together but something tells me that the choices he made at the end of the book are going to come back and bite him in the ass big time.  {Hint&#8230;. Manny}Carly, I love her and think she&#8217; going to be an even bigger part of Emmy&#8217;s life in the near future&#8230; She&#8217;s already become fiercely protective over her and now with everything going on.  I&#8217;m kind of hoping the two women get their heads together and rule the underworld&#8230; GIRL POWER&#8230;.I loved Joseph, a new characters introduced into this book.That&#8217;s just my little rant.Anyway, I digress&#8230; The book was wonderfully written but really did you expect anything less?  The characters were just as real and lively as they were in Crows Row.  You definitely get a better understand of the past and how their little gang came to fruition based on Bill&#8217;s letters&#8230; What letter you ask?  (Read the story)  It just keep getting better and better.

$REVIEW.: While i certainly enjoyed Love in the Balance, and would happily recommend it, I couldn't honestly give it a 4 or 5 star rating. It just wasn't in the same league as Parties in Congress, or Redback, or It Should be a Crime etc (all other novels I've devoured recently).The book was certainly well written, and the storyline was enjoyable enough, but I found the character of Connie to be a teensy bit annoying in the first half of the novel and her need for such an all-consuming friendship seemed to come out of nowhere. Perhaps I just struggled to connect with the characters??Either way, I don't regret buying and reading Love in the Balance but it didn't light me on fire either. I would happily read more from this author to see what else she has.

$REVIEW.: I stumbled upon this series when the first one Beg was free.  Instantly hooked, I read them as quickly as possible and then stalked C.D. Reiss for the final three or four books.Like other reviewers, I will not compare this series to Fifty Shades, Johnathon and Monica may play around a bit, however the story and back story is different for them both.  This is a couple not really looking for anything, but find something in each other.  Yes they have some pretty sketchy backgrounds, but somehow still complete one another.The sex scenes are off the charts hot and Johnathon is an alpha-male I can appreciate.  Sure the crazy is there, but it is crazy you realize you like.  There isn't a stinker in the bunch, in fact the books get hotter as they go. I like the fact that the story isn't centered around the sexual relationship, but how Johnathon and Monica make it work with all that is going on around them.Stick with this series as the last one will kick you right in the heart.  C.D. Reiss brings it all out for the finale, while leaving you wanting more.

$REVIEW.: I grew up near YNP.  I have worked at Old Faithful Inn.  I've visted the park so many times I've lost count.  And during my most recent visit in Aug 05, I saw a whole assortment of tourons behaving badly.  I've seen people walk up to geysers, stick their hands in hot pools, attempt to pet elk and bison, and drive like they're weaving around LA.  For some reason, it never sinks in that Yellowstone is not a rocky mountain Disneyland.This book has always been one of my favorites about the park.  I think it should be given out at the entrances.  However, most folks don't read the pamphlets handed out in the first place. Death in Yellowstone, while morbidly entertaining, is a book that has to exist in the hopes that someone may take a lesson away from it.It is my hope that the author will put out a second edition sometime soon, as I know of a few interesting deaths that have happened not only the summer I worked there but others as well.This is a must read for anyone who loves Yellowstone.

$REVIEW.: I haven't quite finished this book, though I am thoroughly awed by the genuine and probing look into the world through the gifted prose of Mr. Gooch. I was told that Mr. Gooch is probably going to be posthumously appreciated AND my hope is that that person is wrong. I see a great wisdom printed on these pages. I also sense a deep humility underscoring his means of emphasizing the implications of his take on our shared course of events, from the ancient to the present. I reccomend this book to any who are interested in one man's view; a view that could shed light and awaken a new and more compassionate treatment of humanity. Even with all the reasons to condemn our current circumstances and the means by which we have sought remedy, I am inspired by Mr. Gooch and the clarity of his sight. I see the world with new eyes and look forward to reading more of his books as they find their way into my hands. I am not addressing the actual content because I believe it will either be of interest, OR hopefully you will heed my words of endorsement. Either way, for me, there is much more to understanding where we have come from than I had earlier surmised. For this understanding and clear transmission, I am relieved from some of the burden, and am now charged with bringing my heart to the world, undefended and honoring of all parts that has brought me this far. Now is the most important time...what do you choose above all else?If Mr. Gooch is still living and occasionally checks out the reviews, I bless you and am letting you know that you have made a difference in one man's life. 'nough said!

$REVIEW.: For anyone with wanderlust in their blood, this is the coffee table book for you. Having thoroughly enjoyed the Lonely Planet's photo extravaganza predecessor, "The Travel Book: A Journey Through Every Country in the World", I was excited to see that editor Roz Hopkins has chosen to follow up with this subjective ranking of the two hundred cities deemed traveler favorites by Lonely Planet's readers and editors. Smaller, lighter and admittedly less definitive than "The Travel Book", "The Cities Book" is just as entertaining - slightly over five pounds of often glorious photographs and thumbnail sketches of the chosen cities.The format is straightforward. Each city has a two-page spread with four defining photos and the following information consistently presented:--Vital Statistics: Quick facts providing the date when the city was born, its elevation, its geographic size and location, its population and its nickname. It's amazing how Paris has set the standard for so many other cities, e.g., Budapest is known as the "Paris of Eastern Europe" and Beirut the "Paris of the Middle East".--Anatomy: Description of the geographic layout of the city and how to navigate within.--People: Ethnic breakdown of the denizens.--Typical Native: Profile of what characterizes the city's typical native and what he/she thinks is important.--Defining Experience: A sequential series of personal experiences unique to what the city offers, which can be done fairly easily by a traveler.--Strengths: List of places, events and experiences that identify the best of what the city offers.--Weaknesses: The flip side of what areas of development the city may have, e.g., Tokyo's high cost of living or St. Petersburg's collapsed buildings.--Gold Star: One unique characteristic of the city that approaches the transcendent, e.g., carnival in Venice or the four Unesco World Heritage sights within Kathmandu.--Cityspeak: Top conversation topics of natives.--Starring Role in...: Selected books or films in which the city is prominently featured.--Import: List of things (e.g., sports, foods, types of people, etc.) that have been historically absorbed in the city from other places.--Export: List of personalities icons, famous items of interest or pervasive traditions that have their roots in the city.--Sensory recommendations: See, Eat, Drink, Do, Watch, Buy, After Dark...sound bites about things to do to tantalize your senses in the city.--Urban Myth: A colorful story, usually apocryphal in nature, about the city's history.Obviously not as all-encompassing as "The Travel Book", which covers all the countries of the world, the list of top 200 cities will clearly elicit arguments as to which ones have been selected, where they rank and most critically, which ones did not make the cut. It hardly reflects the most scientific of methodologies as it is based on a poll taken for three months in early 2005 on the Lonely Planet Web site asking readers to vote for their favorite cities. Votes were also added for Lonely Planet's writers and employees.From my perspective, the selections for the first one-third of the list are inarguable even though the rankings may surprise, e.g., Los Angeles seems low at #49, while Melbourne quite high at #11. The remainder of the list is a colorful hodgepodge with established cities mixed in with quite obscure choices in often remote locations. I think it would have made sense to include some parameters around what constitutes a city versus a town or a village, e.g., at #159, Christiansted in the US Virgin Islands has only 7,800 inhabitants, while Alexandria, Egypt, at #162, has 3.3 million people. Unsurprisingly, the US is the most represented country with 14 cities recognized and yet the omissions are glaring, e.g., Boston, San Diego, Santa Fe, Honolulu, among others. However, debating the choices is a major part of the fun, as well as the type of information that Lonely Planet offers for each city which has been culled mainly from their comprehensive guidebooks.To give you a sampling, the top 25 cities are: (1) Paris; (2) New York; (3) Sydney (4) Barcelona; (5) London; (6) Rome; (7) San Francisco; (8) Bangkok; (9) Cape Town; (10) Istanbul; (11) Melbourne; (12) Hong Kong; (13) Kathmandu; (14) Prague; (15) Vancouver; (16) Buenos Aires; (17) Rio de Janeiro; (18) Berlin; (19) Jerusalem; (20) Montreal; (21) Edinburgh; (22) Venice; (23) Hanoi; (24) Amsterdam; (25) Singapore. Here's a list of the last five to illustrate their relative obscurity: (196) Saint-Denis, Reunion; (197) Granada, Spain (not obscure but the last of five Spanish cities listed); (198) Beira, Mozambique; (199) Madang, Papua New Guinea; (200) Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.There is an interesting series of introductory essays on the past, present and future of urbanization. The photographic quality is generally superb, and you get a true flavor of the cities especially the inhabitants. I think for the more obscure locations, it would have helped to have a greater sense of the cityscapes. A great purchase for global trekkers and armchair travelers alike, this hefty book achieves its primary objective - to showcase the incredible diversity of the world through the urban oases in which most of us live.

$review_text.: Ilona Andrews is a great writing team (husband/wife)

 This new series show a lot of potential - not as good as the Kate Daniels series (excellent!), but exceeds The Edge (average) books

 If you are unfamiliar with this author/s, this is their first (to my knowledge) foray into Sci-fi, although it is a very soft version - eg: some of the aliens are werewolves and vampires (very generic and unimaginative), the others barely mentioned
 Still, the role of Inn-Keeper is fresh, for me, and their customary humour is present.One of the things I do admire about these authors is that their characters have different personalities in each series
 So many authors seems in a rut, producing the same hero/heroine, just with different names.In defence of only giving it four stars, some things seemed copied or stereotyped (I think I mentioned the werewolf/vampire love-triangle?)


 But even the pet dog, Beast, reminded me of the Beagle in the book/movie 'I Am Number Four'

 The Market is also cliche, but so open with opportunity.These are great writers, but this not their best work - that would be Kate Daniels, book 1

 They set their own barr - now they have to live up to it.All in all, a delightful, casual read

 I will definitely buy the sequel, but hope for more drama/excitement from it.

$REVIEW.: This is such a great idea taking books, book bloggers, and mouth watering recipes all in one book. All the recipes went really well with the books. They all had descriptions why that certain food was chosen and it just made sense. "The 7-Day Layer Dip" for Lauren Oliver's Before I Fall went perfectly with the story. With each recipe there was also excerpts of bloggers reviews of that certain novel. It was a nice touch, to an already great book.I was able to make one of the recipes "Fairy Touched Calico Brownies" based on the book Fablehaven by Brandon Mull. The brownies were topped with a mint icing and a hard chocolate topping. I have yet to read the book but this recipe just looked to good to pass up and I already had most of the ingredients at my house. The instructions were easy to follow and the brownies came out perfectly. Everyone loved them. I can't wait to try out some more recipes from this cookbook.This is a great cookbook for any blogger, author, and reader to have. At only .99 cents on Amazon it's a hard deal to pass. I think everyone should have a copy of The Book Blogger's Cookbook.

$REVIEW.: I bought No Touch Monkey based on title alone.  So funny, it perfectly describes situations I've seen while traveling.  That said, I found the writing to be less funny than the title.  Not bad by any means, just not gut-splitting or snicker inducing.  I had the same response from two of my traveling friends who'd read it.  They smiled, but no laughs.Ayun Halliday's self-deprecating and sarcastic writing is likeable.  But the pattern in each chapter quickly becomes apparent: she and her companions make incredibly naive and/or dangerous choices in oddball foreign places and bumble through the results.  Halliday's younger self is often whiny or dislikeable, which is to the author's credit and done in a self-mocking manner, but even this becomes tiring when combined with the predictability of the essays.  Sadly, the "No Touch Monkey" chapter that I'd been anticipating was a bit of a let-down.  Maybe the brilliant title dooms the book.  Compared, the writing lags.  Which is a dead shame, because Halliday is a genuinely funny lady.  Her column in Bust magazine is a spirited and slightly twisted take on motherhood and she also maintains an excellently quirky website.

$REVIEW.: This book has a very traditional view on Reiki.  For those of you that are considering being attuned via the internet, you may be somewhat disheartened by this book.  I say, "buy it anyway".  It is a very informative book and is written well.  I personally believe that all people are capable of bringing energy into themselves, whether it be through Reiki, healing touch, qi gong and a host of other healing practices.  I was attuned via the internet and I was extremely satisfied.  I have experienced amazing results with Reiki with myself and many others.  This book did an excellent job teaching me some of the important things I may have missed in a one-on-one experience.  I appreciate this author's expertise and thoughts on Reiki and would recommend this book to all people seeking to learn energy healing.

$review_text.: I like alternate history books especially about WWII.  I discovered &#34;If the South Had Won the Civil War&#34; when it was new and that opened my eyes to the genre. WWII is my favorite period for serious military history reading and also for fiction and alternate history.  North Reich holds together very well and while I would quibble about some details of events it didn't hurt the tale overall. What I really like is the book is written in the style of a 1940s book.  Only a handful of anachronisms sneak in mostly the stirrings of 1970's feminism in the female lead.  But overall a book that does an excellent job of taking you back in time with a You Are There feel. The operational level of war as described hung together and the appearances of the towering historical figures seemed believable.  It was a good story, well told.

$review_text.: Beautiful jewelry pieces.  Great work and photos.  Only one error, someone confused the difference between "synthetic" gems and "simulant" gems.  Simulant stones are man made to resemble the real or natural gemstone, i.e. CZ and diamondA Synthetic gemstone, is actually grown from a natural seed of the natural gemstone in a controlled environment. The synthetic (if of a good quality) will test out as the real thing, chemically, in composition,  growth structure, color etc.  An ethical gemstone dealer will always tell a buyer, whether a stone is natural, treated, a synthetic or a simulant.  Full disclosure is a vital practice.This error is not important to those people who are not using genuine gemstone beads, etc.  However, there are cabochons available that resemble gemstones.  Some materials are dyed to look like Turquois.  Howlite is a good example.  Howlite is a chalky white with black matrix  running through it.  It is a stone used for beads etc, in it's own right.  This information is important to those who want to learn.

$REVIEW.: I am a beginning spinner, trying to learn how to work the wheel to get the different kinds of yarn I want.  Admittedly, much of Amos's book is technical, with mathematical equations that are more daunting than anything else, but there is an astounding array of knowledge, that, while not directly helpful to my goals is fascinating, nonetheless.  So far (I'm up to chapter 5) I've learned a few techniques that have helped to craft my spinning into something more advanced than bumbling, but more than that, the book has sparked my further interest into the world of spinning.  For example, I don't plan on growing, harvesting and preparing flax for spinnng, but I was fascinated with learning about the process.All in all, a great read.

$review_text.: ***I received this book free for an honest review.***The story revolves around Paul a street urchin who finds out he is the second born son of the King and Queen in a land that follows an ancient law that sentences all second-born twins to death. Paul&#8217;s older twin brother Rupert is mentally handicapped. Paul agrees to a plot to take his brother&#8217;s place as the crown prince in order to protect Rupert from being killed for his disability.Urchin King&#8217;s plot is very original. It is a really interesting concept, a street urchin replacing a prince and suddenly having to learn how to act like a noble and ruler. If he is caught he will be executed.I loved the characters. Paul is kind but tough and very protective of the people he cares about. I did however, think Paul found it too easy to trust people especially as he was a street urchin. Though this didn&#8217;t detract from the story. Rupert is so sweet, it&#8217;s hard not to love him.Unfortunately I felt that while the story began strong, it started to become undone about half-way through. It jumped from scene to scene really quickly. I would have also liked more depth and descriptions, particularly in regards to the characters and their feelings. I never really knew what Paul was feeling towards his biological parents. It was like the author had a lot they wanted to fit into the story and not much time to do it. The last chapter especially felt rushed. I think it could have benefited from maybe splitting the story into two books. I also felt the love story between (involving Lilla) towards the end of the novel was unnecessary. It didn&#8217;t really add anything to the story and I just found it a bit silly. That being said it was a fun read and a good YA novel. Actual rating 2.5/5.

Jane Porter is masterful at multidimensional characters who are in the middle of their lives and suddenly find themselves in a ROMANCE. The reader is never lost in details, but the characters are meaty. It's real. I'm especially loving these Sheenan brothers. JP also has a long story arc that threads through the series.

$review_text.: Not a very suspenseful book, had to force myself to finish it.  The daughter's story had no purpose except as an avenue to tell her mother's story, so, needles to say, the characters in her life were irrelevant, annoying, pointless.  The mother's story was somewhat predictable, not too surprising. I felt like I was constantly reading about changing buses or walking routes to avoid being followed or Eva and Romers love trysts.  It would have been interesting to find out more about Romer, how he came into his normal, upperclass life after killing everyone else and the war was over.  After all the killing he did, for him to kill himself in the end was too simple a way to end the book, a let down.  The description/write-up of the book was much more exciting than the book itself.

$REVIEW.: Initial Thoughts:This one had been at the top of my Amazon recommendations for some time now and I finally gave in to see what all the hype was about.The Pros:I really liked Ellery's character. She was stubborn and feisty and I loved it. It seems that in a post Fifty Shades literary world, the shy, "I'll do whatever you say" heroine is far too prevalent. Since that is the opposite of what I am, I hate that trend. Ellery was someone I could relate to. If I want ice cream, I want ice cream, and there is nothing you can do to stop me.Ellery's secret was something I was but at the same time wasn't expecting. It was a huge secret, and it was something I hadn't experienced in a book before. It definitely changed the course that the book was going in.Peyton was a great friend. She wasn't one of these fair weather "best friends" I often see in romance novels. She was really there for Ellery, even though they hadn't known each other for that long.I liked the dynamic between Connor's staff and Ellery. There was no disconnect or hierarchy, and they all genuinely cared about Connor and Ellery.The Cons:The whole situation with Ashlyn pissed me off. I get that Connor was scared of what she would do, but  christ on a bike.... bitch was cray!Ellery's stubbornness grated on a me a few times during the novel. I know that is just her character, but it got a little too much at times.I didn't find Connor that swoon worthy. I know, you think I'm crazy. I just didn't.The ending seemed rushed and confusing. The two epilogues were disjointed and left me with a lot of questions. I guess it kept it open for the second book, but it was in a really weird way.The Wrap Up: 3.5/5I wanted to absolutely love this book like it seems everyone else did, but I didn't. I did like it, but it is nowhere near the top of my list.

$review_text.: I saw this described as a "crime spoof," which is a perfect description. It is full of humor, often dry and subtle, as the stereotype of English humor would indicate. I learned the names of obscure (to me) birds and fish, which are used as codenames amongst the criminals; thankfully, my Kindle dictionary knew them all. Many of the criminals, especially the protagonist Chris Machin, are likeable and sympathetic (with the exception of those crimes they're supposed to be committing). In contrast, the police are anything but, not to mention much better at crime than the criminals.Beyond the story, I enjoyed the way Kirton strings words together. For example, I love this line, for how it twists the clich&eacute; into something clever, rather than overused:"Hawk would undoubtedly have been more suspicious, but he was desperate for a gift horse and its mouth was invisible at the other end of a telephone line."Kirton won the 2011 Forward National Literature Award in the humor category for this book, and the reason is apparent.**Originally written for "Books and Pals" book blog.

$review_text.: What would you do if your life as you know it suddenly changed? Would you take the cards that life handed you, or would you fight to clear your name?Thug In Me revolves around a young man name Chance who grew up in a single family home. Even though he grew in a rough neighborhood, he was still able to beat the odds. He obtained a college degree and had a great job at Microsoft. Chance took care of his mother and just recently purchased a new home. Things suddenly change when Chance is wrongly convicted of murder and is now facing a long prison bid. Everything is slowing slipping away: his job, his girlfriend, and his life as he knows it. Will Chance be able to clear his name,  or will he waste his life in prison for a crime he didn't commit?Calhoun is Chance's best friend and brother, and the two of them have been through thick and thin together. Chance never understood how his best friend's, who came from a two-parent middle class household, could be in total chaos. Calhoun had every chance awarded and given to him, but instead he chose to be a thug in the street, a dead beat father and go in and out of prison. Calhoun has always taken chances, but when secrets are revealed, will Calhoun and Chance friendship be able to test the obstacles put before the?Thug In Me is an excellent read by Karen Williams. This book covers various topics that are relevant in our society today. I enjoyed reading the book from cover to cover. Chance was able to overcome life-altering obstacles and situations and still remember his morals and dignity. Thug In Me is a must read, and I can't wait to read the next novel by Karen Williams.

$REVIEW.: This is a group of scifi short stories with some very interesting concepts. I particularly liked Life in Prison and Forms of Love. The author explores his ideas through unique points of view and often surprises with startling endings.At times the translation of this book (from Italian) is a bit bumpy when it comes to dialogue, but it is worth the effort to wade through that to the meat of the stories.Be advised this book should have a sexual contents notice on it. For those readers who enjoy the erotica this is nicely done.All-in-all, I would suggest it to any reader that would like to explore a new up-and-coming author with a voice all his own.

$review_text.: I've heard this book mentioned so many times, I decided to pick up a copy. The first thing I noticed was the absence of an index. That should have been enough of a red flag for me to give up on the book, but I read on. It took me about twenty minutes to finish the whole thing. I skipped the thirty or so pages of pointless one-sentence testimonials from random pet owners who feed their pets raw.Who is the target audience for this book? It isn't people who are already feeding raw. All of the useful information can be found in other, older, far better books than this one. In fact, you can easily obtain all of the books Schultze copied her info from. It can't be for people who are new to feeding raw, because there is very little practical advice on how to go about feeding *your* dog. And it sure isn't cat owners, because the book is really geared toward dog people.There's nothing really wrong with &quot;Natural Diets,&quot; but there really isn't any reason to read it, either. Next book, please!

$review_text.: Elaborate compass roses, legends, latitudes, longitudes, scale indicators, and landmark icons; the world of maps is a mysterious, and often-complex one. In Follow That Map!: A First Book of Mapping Skills, book creator Scott Ritchie brings mapping down to a fun, colourful, and manageable level for young children.Ritchie begins by introducing young readers to the characters, and a diagram that explains the common features found on a map, When Pedro notices that Sally's dog Max, and her cat Ollie are "missing", the children are off on an imaginary voyage that will take them around the world and back in search of the missing pets.At each stop along the way, new mapping skills are taught by placing the characters directly on landscapes that appear as detailed maps from the overhead, offset perspective the bold illustrations are drawn from. This perspective is consistent throughout, even when no mapping skills are being taught, adding to a consistent feel throughout the book.As the children scour the neighborhood for Max and Ollie, legend skills are introduced, with an interactive question to engage children. At each progressive stop additional skills are folded in, sometimes in combination with each other. When the children strike out through the city in search of the zoo, using a compass rose is the main focus, with legend skills also included.When I sat down to work through Follow That Map! with my daughter it seemed almost too easy - the learning that came from reading the simple story and asking her the included questions was effortless and fun for both of us. The introductory level skills explored are: legends, trails, compass rose, scale bar, weather map, following directions with the help of a map, topographical maps, landmarks, and world maps. A simple map of the planets in our solar system is also included, as well as instructions on how to create a simple, yet accurate map of a room in your home with a sheet of graph paper.Incredibly appealing to young children visually, the cartoon-like illustrations fill most of each two-page spread, with a small amount of text, plenty of white space, and a large font for early readers. Written for four to seven-year-olds, Follow That Map! serves as a geography primer of sorts - an easily accessible sample to pique the interest of young learners, and to familiarize them with tools that they will use for the rest of their lives. The bright drawings, game-like activities, and subtle humor encourage repeat readings, browsing, and informal map-play times guided by improvised questions.

$review_text.: Famous tattoo artist sporting a Mohawk and ink of his own with a sweet side for a quiet, shy, and timid accountant from Ohio...that's one couple you'd never think would make it, but in this book, that's exactly what happens!I've always been a fan of tattoos so when I read the blurb to this one, I knew I had to read it.  I am SO glad that I did because I loved it.It was such a nice breath of fresh air because this one was written like a true romance should be.  They meet under some funny circumstances, they both know they're attracted to one another, differences keep them apart but they can't fight the pull of desire for one another. They don't jump in the sack moments after meeting one another, they flirt and gradually build up to being with one another. They fight the odds and keep at it, both of them changing a little bit to become the people that they want to be for one another.I just LOVE Shane. He's hot, charming, sweet, and funny. The way that he is always there for and wants to protect Lindsey had me swooning!  Lindsey made me yell out loud a few times (literally lol) because she's so timid and sweet that at times, she makes you just want to shake her and say, &#34;let loose a little bit&#34;!  Shane gets a spark out of her though, and it was great to see.The secondary characters in the book are great as well - it's obvious that they will show up again in future books in this series.  I can't wait to read the next one.5/5 stars on this one for sure!

She loved Cutter but something was missing from their relationship sexually. Katie just can't let go of her feelings for Cutter. She crashes Cutter's sister's wedding in hopes of making something happen. Katie gets way more than she bargained for and now she is more confused than ever.Cutter Standifer is as stubborn as they come. This hot cowboy sees the world as black and white and once you cross him you can forget about getting his forgiveness. Cutter's sister is in a m&eacute;nage relationship he hates and just married his worst enemy. He just can't handle the fact that his baby sister is married to the man that ruined his relationship with the love of his life, Katie. Now that Katie's back in his life he is determined to make the most out of it. Cutter believes some no-strings sex just might make things better.Unforgiven is seriously smokin' hot! Emotions are running high in Unforgiven. Cutter is so angry not just with Katie for cheating but also at his sister Dani for marrying Justin, a man he hates. Don't even get him started on the fact that everyone knows his baby sister is actually in a relationship with two men. Cutter's anger fuels the hot passionate sex that he shares with Katie. They may decide on no-strings sex, but you can only deny your true feelings for so long. It doesn't matter how great the sex is between Katie and Cutter in Unforgiven, they can never have a successful relationship if he cannot forgive Katie for her indiscretion with Justin.

This book did not disappoint in any way and was a great sequel even though the last half was so heartbreaking.  I loved the fact that it picks up just a few months after BOatK took place and we got to see them settling into a life as a family in the Green Monstrosity.  Bear was just as lovable as before with a few new issues to drive him crazy.  And the Kid...what can be said about the Kid except that once again he dug a little deeper into my heart.  Oh yeah, that little glimpse of the future we got at the end?  Wonderful!  I can't wait for a book about a grown-up Kid.  Be advised to have a box of tissues handy for this book- you'll need them.

Will they be able to put a face to who the tormentor is before someone is seriously hurt or perhaps murdered?Don&#8217;t miss the latest installment in this series, you won&#8217;t be disappointed, I sure wasn&#8217;t, just wanted more!I received this book from the author, and was not required to give a positive review.

Too much tampering with evidence and information has occured. Too many writers have added disinformation. Just because there is no "gotcha" book out there doesn't mean several aren't extremely useful.Don't be derailed by lengthy arguments over small details. The public has a right to know who was involved and why. Mary's Mosaic is first rate. Add it to the list of useful books on this tragedy. When the ex-wife of a major CIA official and mistress to JFK, is murdered in a public park in broad daylight, a year or two after his death and shortly after the Warren report was issued, it is not a random event.

$review_text.: This is a mesmerising read. The opening scene is stunningly unique not only in its concept and the beautiful writing, but in the way it entices you into the story leaving you no option but to keep reading.Tim Roux has the natural ability of a really good writer to combine in just the right proportions plenty of eye-bulging action and dialogue with pearls of philosophical and psychological wisdom, interwoven into the story by the ill-fated first-person narrator, Keith McGuire, without ever appearing over-intellectual or out of place. I found myself nodding my head in approval on many occasions throughout the book.He also manages to endear you to Keith - in spite of the shocking anti-social acts he is driven to commit in his endeavour to protect his real wife and children when he finds himself in the body of Harry Walker, an ugly, thuggish criminal with no moral principles.The combination of romance, paranormal and crime thriller works brilliantly, and the paranormal aspect is so cleverly constructed that to me it never seemed contrived, but perfectly realistic. The earlier back-story of how Keith and his lovely wife Chrissie grew up in a care home and fell in love and have remained in love ever since is told with a poignancy that will stay with me for a long time.Not only is this an unputdownable read, but there is much to be learned and thought about in this exceptional novel.

My favorite part of the book is the list of supplements that we can take to supplement the lack of the vitamin everyday. Great, fast read!
$SUMMARY.: Great Read on Vitamin D

$review_text.: This 111 page novella is based on a series of stories from the Grantville Gazette.  It doesn't stand up to the Eric Flint authored full length novels, but it should be looked at as &#34;an addition to&#34; rather than as a &#34;substitute for&#34; the longer works in the series.  I liked it just fine for what the authors intended it to be.  Although the characters are not as fully developed as the main line characters, they are real enough to enjoy the telling.  I particularly like the interchange between Sweet-pea and Swordfish, Mr. and Mrs. Pridemore.  They have the kind of easy affection of the long married which wears well for the reader.  Some of the ideas, like using ghee  for fuel, took some imagination and knowledge.All in all we like this addition to the Grantville universe.  Kevin H. and Karen C. Evans should view their work with pride and the reader with enjoyment.  Who would have imagined a steam powered Hindenburg fueled by butter?I wonder with Swordfish will be up to in the next stories.  Can't wait actually.  Write more, write faster Evanses! And thanks.

$REVIEW.: It's Christmas morning on the edge of the Victorian high country.  Sarah Barnard's marriage has collapsed, her trail-riding business has been bankrupted, and her parents have invited her to spend the day with them.  Sarah's determined to get some time to herself, and rides her horse Tansy up into the Mortimer Ranges.  Riding up to Hangman's Hut, a flash flood washes away the bridge Sarah and Tansy crossed.  Sarah continues on, hoping that once the weather passes she'll be able to find her way back down the mountain safely.  Sarah finds an abandoned workmen's camp which provides shelter and some food and settles in for the night.  And then she finds a lone, injured and unequipped bushwalker.  His name, he says, is Heath.  Sarah finds his presence unsettling, and his story and subsequent actions don't make sense.  The weather allows little respite, and when food starts to run low, Sarah searches for help.`All that mattered was not dying.'There are a few twists in this story which add to the suspense.  Physical discomfort is one aspect of Sarah and Heath's ordeal, another is the fact that things go missing: it's almost as though a third person is present.  Heath seems to be hiding something, which makes Sarah wonder if he really is who he says he is.  Is Sarah in danger?I thought I knew where this story was going, and I was completely wrong.  Which was good, because the story that unfolded was much more interesting than the one I thought I was going to read.  Until, that is, the end.  I didn't care much for the end - but that's me writing a different story.  I read this on a wet, cold autumn afternoon: just perfect.  This is the first novel I have read by Honey Brown: I'll be looking out for others.Jennifer Cameron-Smith

$REVIEW.: In Christmas Carol by Michelle Gorman readers are introduced to Carol. Carol who is a workaholic is over Christmas, weddings and anything related to relationships having been recently dumped. Carol has to put her feelings aside to attend her sister, Marley&#8217;s wedding, which is happening Christmas weekend.When Carol arrives at the wedding location she realizes that three of her ex-boyfriends are attending as well. This is just what Carol needs to face her past. Will this weekend change her life for the better? It just may after Carol starts thinks about what went wrong in these three relationships.What I Did Not Like: This book started slow but picked up later and it had some repetitive language.What I Did Like: The main characters reflection on her past relationships that helps her move forward. I also loved the ending of this book even though it was not a surprise. The author does a wonderful job slightly mimicking the original story of A Christmas Carol but putting her own spin on it.This book was provided by the author for review purposes.Teresa BeasleyA&RBC; Reviews4 Stars=Great Page Turner

$review_text.: Author Justin Bog has written something evocative. His characters are relate-able and at other times unfathomable. They linger someplace between caring and detachment. I feel similar desperation in my own life - trying to be there for others while moving myself forward. There's a balance we must all find. Patrick and the other characters are not able to find this, and are stuck within relationships -professional and personal- that become largely destructive. The Conversationalist is brilliant in its psychology, and relevance. You will be thinking of this book long after you turn the last page.

$review_text.: The tales of the British underclass in this book are shocking, particularly to someone like me, who grew up on the "green and pleasant land" view of Britain.  However, Dalrymple's no historian.About all the bad behavior he documents in this book could be duplicated, almost item-for-item, in the slums of the nineteenth century.  The yobbos and their birds whose pitifully misspent lives he describes would fit right in on the streets of Whitechapel, or Jacob's Island.The big difference is that nowadays a large segment of society has gotten a case of the guilties, and insists on making endless excuses for the misbehavior of what my Southern acquaintances would call "white trash."  In the US, a lot of this sort of loutish, self-destructive asininity is laid at the door of "racism," but since the majority of the British underclass is white, that dog won't hunt here.

$REVIEW.: THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SOME SPOILERSThe Lost Souls is book 2.5 in a series I'm crazy over.  These books are not lengthy, but they carry a real punch filled with emotion and hidden gems, jam packed like an underground gold mind.From the title The Lost Souls many ideas come to mind:The human characters that are continually getting split up and lost from each otherThe skin eaters who aren't dead but aren't quite alive seeming to be soulless killing machinesThe deaths of charactersThe Soul (as in the split soul reincarnated through time) and those who have lost it over time (they don't seem to fair too well)The other books were mainly about Gerik, Trinity and Xan.  This book is mainly about all the other characters.  Most of it takes place during the same time as book 2, but it is from the other characters' points of view.The quote from the beginning of the book is"Not all those who wander are lost..."-J. R. R. TolkienThen, the first words of the Prologue areWhat is fate?  Or destiny?Do we each have a predestined plan-a path mapped out long before we were born to lead us on our journey?  Does someone, something, somewhere already know what is yet to come?From these two quotes, I want to think that the ones that have wandering souls have not lost them, and every bit of this has been part of a bigger plan.  Because of how everything goes, characters that would never have crossed paths become key roles in each other's lives, completely changing the story.  Also because of the appearance of an end of time type feeling, we see sides to characters we wouldn't have known otherwise.  Many rise up as leaders, show unwavering faith and unending sacrifice.  Many make rash, devastating decisions.  It's all cause and effect.I love Gerik, but he isn't really present in this book.  He's turned full dragon, and left the show for the time being.  I missed him.  We did get some great insight about him through others thoughts.  One quote I have to point out to anyone anti-Gerik is from Marko after he had received The Soul and immediately raped Cassie.He wasn't sure how Trinity had evaded Gerik for as long as she had back in the Catskills, or how Gerik hadn't gone stark raving mad from her constant refusal of him.  Gerk was a better man than he was, that was for certain.  Marko had possessed that damn soul for a single second and look what he'd done.  But then again, that soul had never been meant for him.This leads me to the first characters that I want to discuss-Carrie and Marko.  From the quote above and what goes down, wow, just wow, this split soul business is rough.Fate wasn't suppose to make sense.  It just was.  That destiny, everyone's, had been written in the stars long before their births, long before...anything.It was incredibly odd, utterly indescribable, the sensation like nothing he'd ever felt before.  Almost as if he were four people all at once.  He was himself, feeling his own feelings, and yet he was him, feeling her feelings.  But then he was also feeling her, feeling her own feelings, and he was also her, feeling his feelings.In my opinion, it was imperative that the souls mate right then.  I had said before, it was killing Gerik because when Trieme was 22 and Emilian was 29, she was pregnant.  She was killed before the baby was born causing Emilian to go dark bringing about this whole curse on mankind.  To complete the cycle Gerik needed to mate with Trinity.  They were the perfect ages, she 22 and he 29, but then she broke the bond by being with Xan.  Then all hell ended up breaking loose and the backlash of that hell was shared by all.  Now Marko got the soul (at 29) and he made that freezikin baby, by gods!  Carrie is just 17, but desperate times call for desperate measures!  Third time is a charm.  I think this baby has to be born in order to lay the soul to rest.The next are Shandor and Tahyra.  What makes them so different from the other skin eaters?  Shandor had magic before making him more in tune with nature and more knowledgeable of the unnatural.  This is the reasoning he seems to be leaning toward."Try not to judge so harshly that which you don't understand.""You're the sort of beautiful a man doesn't just want to ****.  You're the kind a man wants to watch fall apart beneath him, so he knows that it was him who broke her."Remember Tahyra's father called her Atropos (she who cannot be turned) so I'm pretty sure she is going to be important in the final outcome.Shandor stared at her, feeling the man and the beast inside him coming together.  She was the one thing they agreed upon.  She was their prefect mate, their perfect female.  They would protect her at all costs.  No man or beast would get close enough to take her.  She was theirs, and they were hers.Both of these characters are certain to have very principal roles to play.  They are the connection between the natural and the unnatural worlds.On a random note, I just gotta say, wtf is it about Becki that makes every man hop the crazy train!  I must have missed something when it comes to her.  Nico, lord have mercy.Caged humans were no better off than caged animals.Hockey is my next topic.  Madeline seriously had intentions of breaking our hearts with this one I believe.  Hockey seems to have been s*** on the most throughout the series and still come away smelling heavenly."I couldn't give her very much, but I could give her me, all of me.""Maybe you're right, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't live as an honorable man during the remainder of your life.""He'll forgive you, fat&#259;.  If my frate loves you, he'll forgive you.  Us Romani, we are weak when it comes...to...our...women."And then...Then there was nothing at all.  Hockey was in God's hands now.Then, after drying our eyes, we got to read a sneak peek of book 3.  The best part of it was the last line!"I'd say we have a dragon to find."There are many other characters that have roles in this book and the series.  I'm not going to name them all, but it contains a stellar cast varying across the spectrum of lightness and darkness.I noticed several of the Romani had ideas about if they killed Mullo-the first vampir (aka Emilian), that would break the curse.  Also, it's been said over and over throughout the series that Gerik is Trinity's soul and Xan is her heart, and she loves them both completely.  So, I'm assuming from the title of book 3 My Heart and Soul, it's Trinity's Gerik and Xan combining with her to make The Holy Trinity.  Will this be a physiological combination...or...an out-of-body otherworldly combination...or...  Can we please get some sandwich action?  Please.In conclusion, per usual for every book she writes, this book is a literary diamond.  I can't wait for more.I recently did a reread and discuss with some of my reading friends. Of course with a book like this with so much to decipher everyone has varied opinions about what will happen next.This is sorta paraphrasing some of what I wrote in my review and still how I feel no matter what arguments I read. Xan is the heart. Gerik is the soul. Trinity is the body. They are the holy trinity. The baby has to be born to break the curse because Trieme being killed while pregnant is what caused the original curse. Shandor and Tahyra are the connection between the natural and unnatural worlds.Yes, I think if the baby is born, the holy trinity get their siznit straight and "the links between" all play out everything will be broken.

$REVIEW.: The Reawakening Saga is a great story

But it lacks a good thorough professional editing with each book

Lots of spelling errors, especially with words that should have been "through" rather than "though" or at times wrong choice of words

Being this a shorter version book and lacks professional editing, it's not really worth the price this author asking for such a ebook


So far I've read the first three of this saga, and there's three more to go


I felt this is a easy-going, enjoyable series to read, just need to get more professional in its editing process

$REVIEW.: I picked this up because the cover art looked whimsical and I wanted to know if the main character really was a cupcake

That was my sole motivation, and so my sites weren't set that high.The art throughout the book maintains that whimsical tone without becoming twee or too silly-looking.All of the characters in the book are food


Most are vegetables, with a few baked confections and more finished dishes as well

There is no discussion as to exactly why the people of this town are food, nor is there any discussion on the ethics involved in our hero, the cupcake, eagerly devouring cupcakes
This is a good thing because by ignoring it, the author is able to tell his story.It's short and simple, really, just a cupcake who wants to get enough money to travel to meet his culinary hero, Turkish Delight

It resolves about the way you think it would, but the jounrey is pleasant and sweet.I've used a couple of the recipes in this book already, in one case working with my son (who loves the book and reads it often) and found them to be a little trickier than I thought they'd be on first reading, but completely doable for even this less-than-ace home cook.Highly recommended for young people with an interest in food


There isn't much action in the book, so it may not be everyone's cup of tea.

$review_text.: Penelope "Lo" Marin and her parents have moved from city to city because of her dad's work but seem to be in for the long haul in Ohio since her brother, Oren, died there the year before and her mother became listless and disconnected. Before her brother's death and all throughout her childhood, Lo has collected, and at times stolen, quirky objects that appeal to her, but the urge to take objects has increased. When she sees a butterfly pendant at the local flea market, she must have it, especially after she realizes it was one of the things stolen from the the home of a murdered girl known as Sapphire. She becomes obsessed with Sapphire and begins to uncover clues in the murder while collecting anything of Sapphire's she can get her hands on. She gets some grudging help from a guy named Flynt and her discoveries also bring her closer to understanding her brother's death.So, there is a lot going on here, but it is all amazing. Lo herself has a lot going on. It is never really clear what is happening in her mind, but she seemed to have a hoarding addiction (lots of clocks, figurines, et cetera) and obsessive compulsive disorder (she had to arrange all of these objects multiple times a day until they were just right and then start all over the next day). It is clear she has a problem, one that she had help with briefly before rejecting it, and although it is serious, it also made her unique.When she learns about Sapphire and then acquires some of her things, her compulsions begin to get worse, but it also leads her down a path to solving Sapphire's murder and making her matter. Along the way, she learns the ins and outs of the bad part of town, Neverland, from artist Flynt. Their time together creates a mutual attraction that mostly takes the backseat to solving Sapphire's murder. That really worked for me.The fantastic part about The Butterfly Clues is that absolutely everything is connected, even when it seems unlikely. It is part thriller, part murder mystery, and an enthralling debut.Recommended for young adult fans of mysteries and thrillers, as well as contemporary fiction. It does contain some violence and language.Google "The Musings of ALMYBNENR" to see this review in its original format and to follow my book review blog.

$review_text.: Katie is a somewhat layered character.  She's a Type A personality, business professional, single mom, and babygirl/submissive.  She's had some rough relationships in the past and instead chooses to channel her energy into her blog.Although we don't know quite as much about Johnathan, we do learn he's a divorced graphic artist who works from home and raising his twin boys all while trying to help out his sister.  He seems to be innately dominant but also has experience within the lifestyle.This reminds me a bit of one of my all-time favorites, the Brie series by Red Phoenix.  Upon discovering this will also become a series, this first installment makes so much more sense.  The first half of the story is mostly introducing us to the characters; their behaviors, patterns, and personalities.  The second half is just snippets into their growing relationship.  Some time passes between their first meeting and their initial sexual engagement although it's unclear how much, regardless it draws the illusion this will be a long term connection.While the second part of this initial outing was a tad disjointed from the flow of the first half, I still enjoyed this as a novella.  It gives you enough but leaves you wanting more.  The author has a nice technical writing style that switches seamlessly to a more conversational form especially within the dialogue between the two characters.There is obviously a BDSM theme and more directly a Daddy/babygirl type relationship.  While generally familiar with this, it was interesting to read more specifically about some of the dynamics in that type of bond.  Even though some of the interchange between the two weren't necessarily my kinks it was fascinating and enjoyable to read about something different to me plus it is not often where you read "she came with a gush" and that's pretty hot.As it is, the title comes off a bit misleading since there really aren't any adventures...yet.  I wish there was more to this one but at the same time I'm still intrigued to see where things will go with future installments.Rating:  4 starsComplimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest review

$review_text.: This is an outstandingly good book about software construction techniques that lead to a sound, robust product. It starts with simple things like naming conventions, function layout and commenting methods, but covers the whole software development cycle of design, programming and quality assurance. Although it gives plenty of source code examples in several different programming languages, these are always short and easy to follow even for 'language foreigners'. Source code examples are only used to illustrate more general, important points, rather than specific implementation details. The author is careful not to force his personal style on you - which would be rather foolish considering the many 'religious' issues covered (naming conventions anyone? ;) ) - but presents his opinions supported by sound arguments that'll make even skeptics reconsider. The text is an easy read compared to more technical books and is covered with lots of very amusing short stories that highlight key points.This book will be a great aid in keeping your and your coworkers' mental health while programming in a team under a merciless deadline.If you are at all serious about programming - buy this book!

$REVIEW.: A few months ago I tried to read this sample, but was unable to even finish it. I continued to be surprised by the number of positive reviews posted.  When the second book in the Pack Partners series became available it sounded very interesting.  Unfortunately I felt like I'd been dropped in the middle of a story.  I realized that I needed to read the first book to be able to understand the background of the pack members and why they had a turned human as their alpha.So I tried the sample again and though I still feel the toddler biting him scenes are more annoying than amusing, the rest of the sample promised and delivered a very entertaining story. I'm very glad I took another chance on this story. It was well worth it. Taking the journey with Lex as he goes from bitter, isolated human ex-cop that had been forced into early retirement by wounds in the course of duty to the leader of a wolf pack that he never imagined even existed, is a wild & wolfy adventure. As he abruptly adjusts to his new wolf/enhancesd senses, seems to be realistic & compelling, as well as amusing.I truly enjoyed getting to know the other pack members especially Nathan. Now I can go ahead and enjoy the Belligerent Beta now that I know a little about Nate's backstory. So if you are a shifter fan don't be so quick to give up on the story as I did and almost missed out on a really entertaining shifter story & the beginning of a really good series.

I wasn't a big &#34;kid/mommy&#34; type before having my son, so having ideas and knowing where kids his age are coming from developmentally in terms of what to teach/entertain them with is educational and helpful.

$REVIEW.: The Liberator is book two in the Dante Walker series by Victoria Scott.  I have decided that anything Victoria Scott writes is going to be fabulous.  As is this book.The Liberator starts right up where The Collector left off.  Dante Walker believes he is bad, that he is not worthy of redemption.  But of one thing he is sure of and that is his love for his Charlie.  He is wearing a new cuff now, one given to him from The Big Guy upstairs.  He is now a Liberator.  But he has been given his first assignment.  He has to go to Colorado and liberate the soul of a young girl named Aspen.  There are no details as to why this girl&#8217;s soul needs to be liberated.  But he is told that he must prove he is worthy of his new job title.  But to complete this assignment, he has to be away from Charlie.  One thing that doesn&#8217;t change is we still get to enjoy that Dante swagger.  He is still full of himself, most of the time!  And, he is constantly struggling with who he thinks he is and who he thinks he should be, maybe even who he wants to be.&#8220;But I was chill before I met Charlie.  I was chill before I started caring about someone other than myself.  Now I&#8217;m THIS guy.&#8221;&#8220;I feel like such a chick around her sometimes, like I&#8217;m seconds away from buying a tiara and starting my period.&#8221;We are introduced to Aspen.  She won my heart right away.  This girl is obviously hurting for some reason.  But you can see the person she is in the way she cares for her little sister.  Aspen is one tough girl and the more I got to know her, the more I loved her.And then there is Charlie.  She has lost her soul but she is still Charlie.  But while she is apart from Dante, she seems distant to him.&#8220;It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s struggling between two sides of herself, and I want so bad to point this out, but I can&#8217;t, because the same thing is happening to me.&#8221;Even though Dante, Charlie and their friends won my heart in the first book, I feel like in this book, I loved them even more.  I felt like highlighting every other sentence that I read.  The things they said to one another were just so beautiful.  The love between Dante and Charlie is so strong, so beautiful.  They give strength to one another.  Charlie&#8217;s love is Dante&#8217;s salvation.&#8220;You may not have my soul, Dante.  But you will always have my heart.&#8221;And then it&#8217;s over.My life as I knew it is over.I could go on and on with the quotes.  But you will have to read the book yourself.  This book will make you smile, cry, and grip whatever object you are reading it on.  It is truly a story of good vs. evil.  And, yes, there is a cliff hanger.  Luckily there isn&#8217;t long before the final book will be released.  Thank you again Victoria Scott for a wonderful book.  I am truly your biggest fan.&#8220;All I think as I leave the training room is, Yeah, these are my friends.  Real friends.  And then, So this is what it feels like.&#8221;
$SUMMARY.: Wow - Just Wow!

$review_text.: I read reviews of 'The Paris Caper' prior to downloading and the negative ones made me a bit skeptical. I'm glad I gave it a chance because it was a really good book! I can definitely see the issues mentioned in other reviews, but not to the extent that I didn't enjoy the story.Ciara is an American who moved to France with her criminal French husband who showed her the tricks of the trade. She ends up in Paris after his death, where her crimes help support a group of kids dubbed the Orphans. Enter Jean Marc, the French cop trying to catch the thief, not realizing that she is right under his nose. They engage in a steamy relationship that puts them both in jeopardy. There is a lot more to the story that I won't spoil.This book was suspenseful and sexy. It held my interest to the very end. I wouldn't necessarily call Ciara and Jean Marc's relationship romantic in the traditional sense, but it was definitely all-consuming! The author does well with the sex scenes. They were steamy and intense but not distasteful. While neither of the main characters were particularly warm, they were compelling. I liked that they had similar pasts but went down very different paths. The fact that Jean-Marc recognized that he could have easily gone the same route as Ciara added depth to his character. I felt that although some of the choices he made were harsh, they were true to who he was. Actually both characters stayed true to themselves, even with the added complication of their affair. Overall, I enjoyed this book and would read others by this author. The ending is abrupt, but satisfying.

$REVIEW.: Browsing through this book, I thought it was over priced.  Yet I browsed it repeatedly before my purchase.  Practically any of these images are &#34;logo&#34; quality.  They definitely remind you of REAL trees, snails, acorns, grasses, etc.  AND (hallelujah!) they are simple enough to replicate free hand.  I think anyone who wants to build up a mental inventory of ways to draw things will learn from Ms. Renouf:  outline or not? include details but not every little one! vary the line quality...  The publisher has left from to draw in the book, but the graphic design is so pleasant, I didn't want to intrude.  I am happy to have spend several evenings devising scenes in my sketchbook using as many of her suggestions as possible.

While returning from a hunt one night she witnesses a body being dumped in the garden behind her place of employment. The body turns out to be the skinned body of a cougar walker, and finding this body is only the beginning. Kai, as her friends call her, is led down a dark path toward a surprising realization that had me gasping in surprise as she investigates the death of the walker, the kidnapping of one she knows, and the murder of her best friend. From the moment I started reading this book I was enthralled. Though some parts were less action filled than others, the entire book was enjoyable.

$REVIEW.: THE ROCK HOLE is an usual combination of old time Texas humor and chilling thriller
 The year is 1964, and these small communities are mostly segregated by white, black, and American Indians

Ned Parker is the white Constable, who is married to an Indian; best friends with the Black Deputy Sheriff, John Washington; uncle to Cody, a brave Vietnam war veteran; and forever friend of an old codger, Judge O
C.Rains
 After a car crash killed his parents, ten year old Top, has come to live with his grandparents


 Pepper, Top's ten year old tomboy cousin, spends most of her time at their house also.Though a Constable, Ned really considers himself a farmer, who from time to time, finds himself dealing with drunks, bootleggers, and fighting families
 But a new evil has entered his community


 Someone is viciously mutilating animals, and he seems to be escalating his violence

 The communities in Texas and near by Oklahoma are affected


 The chase is on to catch this person who also seems to have a grudge against Ned and his family.This story is populated by wonderfully fleshed out characters, with a feeling of story telling that reminds me of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and A TIME TO KILL
 The atmospheric descriptions took me right back to the good and bad times of the 1960s
It reads like a combination of small town community, and good old fashioned westerns
 Great mystery, but feels like literature at it's finest
 Great start to this series!

$review_text.: i am SO confused by all of the 5 star ratings...especially since i hardly ever rate below a 4 and I thought it was bad.Anyway, there are so many things wrong with this 'book'... the storyline was stupid...it's a cold case, why is she sneaking around trying to 'solve' it like a 10 year old?? If you have info (which she does-the name), go to the police....I get that she had to lie to get the internship, but she could have been honest to Bentley about her dad's case(it's her sister's dad too) and he could have helped her, no biggie-like I said boring cold case that no one cares about (sorry Ceci's dad)...what is with this company Bentley works for? I don't understand anything about it... are they reporters? How does reporting on criminal cases get you so rich, and how is there a whole company devoted to it?? Not realistic at all. Seems shady, or just stupid....it grosses me out that Ceci is in high school. I know she is 18, and he is only 26, but just the fact she is in high school is not okay for me. I don't want to hear about someone's sexcapades as they're on their way to 5th period....why is this set in Omaha??? YAWN. The most interesting thing about Omaha is that Peyton and Eli Manning have a weird obsession with yelling it at football games....Ceci is an annoying, immature child...there is no basis of a relationship between Bentley and Ceci...except they think each other is hot....no chemistry (except during sex scene) b/t B & C. Neither character had any emotional depth and I do not care about them at all. Horrible character development. I think the author needs to learn how to 'show not tell' in this area....i think there was supposed to be mystery and suspense.......? It was too boring for suspense, and too stupid for mystery.theres more little nit-picky things that I won't go into, but I am just disappointed, I was expecting to love this. I won't be finishing the series, and probably won't read another book from this author. thankful it was only $.99 (I feel bad for writing such a negative review, but I feel like people need to see this instead of all the 5-stars)

$review_text.: In Investigating the Hottie by Juli Alexander, Amanda visits her aunt, Christie, during her fall break upon suggestion of her parents to help her cope with the divorce. There she finds that Christie is actually a spy, and she&#8217;s actually been in training much of her life. Her first assignment is to investigate a hottie teenaged hacker, Will.I personally found the read to be enjoyable and quick. I liked Amanda and Will. Christie and her partner, Nic, were also quite fun and hilarious. It did, however, fall short.The plot felt very superficial to me. There was no discussion about her parents&#8217; divorce. It didn&#8217;t seem like she was bothered by it all that much. There also was no real discussion about there assignment or Christie&#8217;s secret life as a spy. Aside from not believing it all at first, she kind of just accepted it. I honestly thought Amanda was quite calm about it all. She also fell quite quickly for Will. They knew each other for like 5 days. Lastly, I think there were some significant unexplained plot holes. For example, I&#8217;m still wondering who called Amanda&#8217;s secret phone. It was never brought up.Overall, I&#8217;d give Investigating the Hottie by Juli Alexander 3 stars. It was an enjoyable, quick read. I did like it. However, it fell a bit short plot wise and didn&#8217;t have the substance to it I was expecting.

$REVIEW.: I have mixed feelings about Deja Voodoo by Elle James. There were some aspects of the story that I liked and others that I could have done without. It begins as another fun and enjoyable read.  Since the end of Voodoo for Two a lot has happened. Lucie is now living in Baton Rouge and she has started her life with Ben. She is back to her old antics of creating spells. Lucie sends Alex a Voodoo charm just as another undercover agent assigned to a case arrives in Bayou Miste. So if you're a fan of Voodoo for Two, you know where this story is headed.There were moments of intense high flying action on the bayou that had me on the edge of my seat. Yet, there were action scenes involving criminals with fast-moving cars that were too similar to those found in Voodoo for Two.  It was just the same actions with different people in a slightly different place at a different time.And once again we follow another Louisiana State Police, Ed, as he is undercover and pursues a love interest, Alex. Alex and Ed have an instant physical attraction, and I did enjoy their story.  Alex struggles with her quest to remain independent and is rather fickle.  One moment she is oh so totally falling for Ed and the next she is pulling away.The problem that I had with this book was the voodoo spell that went awry and brought a new man, Sport, into Calliope's life. I really disliked the setting and circumstances surrounding Sport's transformation. Calliope's interest in Sport is overplayed. She just appears to be desperate and sells herself short. I just couldn't connect with the whole relationship between the two of them or Calliope's desperation to have a man. There were funny aspects of Alex's interactions with Sport; however, the story surrounding Calliope and Sport had a profound effect on my opinion of Deja Voodoo.Rating 2.5/5-The book was okayI received a copy of Deja Voodoo from the publisher for an unbiased review. Thank You.

But he doesn't stop there;  he provides you with links that makes your search for niches and research easier.  Then he goes a step further and gives you the names and links to the people that creates his covers and does his transcription.  How can you lose with all of this information?

$REVIEW.: **Complimentary copy provided by author for an honest review**Changed Forever is great!From all of the books I've read this book is the most unique one in my shelf.The concept of the story is good and I love how the story was written (good flow and easy to understand).The characters are also great, interesting and fascinating.For me, I love how the author made the characters and the story interesting and unique (not the typical genre of book that I've read). The moral lesson of the story is fantastic, I love how the book emphasizes family bonds (between siblings and parent-child). I'm not disappointed in this book, it's a good read.Steven Misosky did a really great job in making this book unique and interesting at the same time.

$REVIEW.: I wonderful read from Ann Hite. The story begins in the South Caroline Low Country with three girls trapped in the slave-culture that existed there at that time in history.Part Southern Gothic, part history, with equal parts of mystery and homespun legend, this artfully crafted tale relays the experiences of early slaves, with-out exploitation, in a realistic fashion that most everyone can understand. The author weaves enough whimsy, legend, and mysticism into the story that it is entertaining as well as educational.You can't get a better read for 99 cents.

$REVIEW.: I'm glad that this book has been re-issued. I purchased an original copy from the 1970s and it did not sit on my shelf for long before it was in my hands and burning its way into my head.Richie has made a career writing about Japan, and this is without doubt a masterful travel book filled with germaine research. But it is also a 70's recreation of a trip the author had taken as a younger man.Since years had passed between the actual travel and the book writing, Richie brings a great deal of his reflections on Japan overall.Richie is a sensualist and is unabashedly honest about his humanity. He has an affair and finds himself falling into lust for an island girl. But his frankness is redemptive - he's probably telling the story that many authors would skirt around.And whatever shortcomings the author may have in his life, he makes up for them with his compassion. He visits a leper colony and has empathy for a girl who has been cured but can never return to Japanese society.The writing, like the photography, is impressionistic. Sometimes Richie will go into a ponderous tangent - such as the time he spends a couple pages talking about the beauty of Japanese skin -but the result overall is moving and somehow heartening.And unlike the deluded Japan travel book (the Lady and the Monk) by the author of this book's introduction, this book seems real.In fact, the cover of the original text from the 70s was the following text spread diagonally across the cover: "An intimate view of the "real" Japan by Donald Richie who reflects upon the total Japan experience while sailing the inland sea."That's the best description possible of this worthwhile book.

$review_text.: Journalist Ambrosia Pellerin accepts an assignment involving the legendary phoenix, expecting, if nothing else, a little entertainment. Instead, she gets pregnant&#8212;by a surprisingly human-looking firebird, Reece Bennu.Ambrosia and Reece struggle to make the best of their predicament, igniting a tentative romance despite Reece&#8217;s furious and powerful relatives who resent the mixed-blood child, a violent human out to prove the existence of phoenixes at any cost, and Ambrosia&#8217;s forced separation from her family and isolation in her new home.Reece&#8217;s relatives plot murder while Ambrosia&#8217;s family faces a dire medical situation and ask her to return. Will the couple survive when Reece denies Ambrosia his trust and her freedom when she needs both more than anything?Review:It must be hard to come up with new and inventive stories, but Ms.Gilman sure did with this one.  I don't think I have read a story about a Phoenix before and I really enjoyed it.Ambrosia is a reporter who after being knocked out while on assignment comes across Reece in the middle of the desert.  Reece helps her and tries to send her away quickly, it does not work and Ambrosia is there when the building explodes and unbeknownst to her Reece is reborn.  In a interesting twist fertile woman can get pregnant from the ashes of the phoenix; which is what happens to Ambrosia.  Now, Reece is &#34;back from dead&#34; and at her door saying he needs to protect her from the man who hurt her in the desert and explain what he is.  Now, I think the part where he protecting her and the &#34;bad guy&#34; were kind of glossed over and somewhat unfinished.  Yes, he destroys the guys evidence of Phoenix's but if the guy was that much into finding the truth wouldn't he just start over and try to pursue them?  So, Reece uproots Amby and tells her she will be looked down on because she is human and not pure blooded, that pissed me off and I think she should have been a little stronger with Reece about it.  The longer they are together the stronger their feelings grow, as well as Reece's grandmother, who is pretty much a racist.  Grandmother does some terrible things in the name of an untainted blood line, which sends Amby running.  But you know Reece goes running after her once he has his grandmother taken care of and they have their HEA.A great inventive storyline that kept me entertained and entranced until the very end.3.5 stars

$REVIEW.: I like Nancy Kress quite a lot so I was happy to see a new, if slim, novel from her. The plot has been adequately described by others so this review will be short as well. I liked the plot structure, three intertwining stories, slowly converging, with the future story (after the fall) ending the book. After the fall, the survivors are desperate, resulting to kidnapping children from the past. Before the fall, the police are baffled by a series of seeming unrelated kidnappings which, nonetheless seem to be predictable by a statistics consultant to the FBI. It was inevitable that, Pete, the main kidnapper from the future and Julie, the FBI consultant, would meet. Especially since the jacket blurb said it would happen.I liked the portrayal of the two main characters. Pete, 15-years-old, trapped in the Shell, frustrated both with the limited kind of life available to him and what he has to do to ensure a future that he's not even sure he believes in. Julie, needing a child but not wanting a husband, guilty about the way in which she had her child and convinced that these kidnappings are related somehow to the hints she sees of looming disaster.I didn't see the Gaia connection coming until it sort of jumped into the story rather late. I'm not sure it was necessary for Gaia to be invoked for the tragedy when Kress had set up several other potential instigators, but it didn't hurt the story for me.

$review_text.: This is part of a series and there was no ending. That cost the book 1 star.There was almost too much action, and it did not seem real to me. The number of deaths also added to my dislike pile.However the book was well written, and I enjoyed it. The "device" was missing for 60 years, what is the importance of finding it now? With all the action in the book, I thought that there would be a better ending.Michael was a great character to like, he has so many enemies that I found myself rooting for him to beat them. He had a hard time deciding who to trust, for good reason, and for the sake of the world he better make up his mind in time. The author did a great job creating these characters, and maybe if I read the first book then maybe I would have gotten more out of this book.I am giving this book a 3/5. I was given a copy to review by orangeberry book tours, however all opinions are my own!

$review_text.: I will admit at first I wasn't sure what to think about the comic that Brandon Graham, Simon Roy, Giannis Milonogiannis, Farel Dalrymple, and others had created. It was strange, but the more I read the more hooked I became. It all felt fresh and new. And it felt strange that it doesn't seem to follow a very direct story structure approach. Instead of going from point 1 to point 2 to point 3 etc, instead it has a nice sort of meandering through the world. And I think that's what really hooks people in. This great sense of discovery in Prophet where you get sit back and take in all the strange and interesting sights and cultures. It's fantastic. It was a lot of fun to read and I highly recommend you check it out.

While none of the patterns are truly AHA! and ground-breaking, they are sufficiently satisfying and could be a fabulous companion to Joelle Hoverson's "Last Minute Knitted Gifts".

$review_text.: Most books don't deal with how society flounders when magic returns to the world.  Most of the series I've read either just skip that portion or barely mention it as part of more personal struggles to deal with magic entering their lives.  This book really puts the focus on how the government tries to maintain order as wizards, werewolves, vampires, and more return to the world.  My only complaint is I wanted to read a sequel immediately upon finishing this book and there wasn't one written yet.  If you enjoyed his Bookworm or Schooled in Magic works this might be right up your alley.

$review_text.: A brilliantly crafty tale about love, treachery, underworld which will take you on a roller coaster ride from Paris to London. The Paris Game by Alyssa Linn Palmer is a thoroughly gripping and brain-rackingly thrilling tale about Sera and Marc.A huge thanks to the author, Alyssa Linn Palmer, for providing me with a copy of her book, in return for an honest review.Sera, a jazz singer, land herself on trouble, when she had to pay off a debt to a very bad gangster. Seeing the situation, Marc, having his own agenda in mind, comes to rescue Sera from this gritty situation. Although he knew that that would cost a lot, and since both had a very dark past, eventually the whole situation spins out-of-control and both of them gets more tangled into the messy situation because of their past and hence provoking more drama and thrill to the already pot-boiling plot.The author has written this story in a flawless way, by not giving away too many details at a single time and also adding too many twists and turns in every pages is what made the book more compelling to read. The characters were absolutely perfect and apt to the plot. Not to mention about the hot, sizzling chemistry between Marc and Sera, which will make you more insanely hooked to his book. All-in-all, it&#8217;s an amazing book, with a pot-boiling plot, which promises to give you some action and hot romance.Grab this book, if you want to go on a sexy, smart, thrilling romantic ride!
$SUMMARY.: A Brilliant, sexy, smart plot which is twisting in every possible way!

$REVIEW.: I am often turned off by negative book reviews, but in this case, I thought it necessary. Typically, I perceive that a negative review of an Arminian work is by a Reformed believer, but not in this case. I will be very brief.As a seminary graduate trained in inductive bible study and exegesis, I find that there are immense exegetical reasons to discard Reformed Theology as false and an eisegetical "biblical" interpretation developed from false philosophical presuppositions.I bought this book, looking for something to add to my understanding, but was so disappointed, even shocked, at the lack of solid exegesis (which abounds in scripture) or convincing arguments (which are many) to help the reader  understand the issues and the overwhelming evidence which demonstrates the errors of Reformed Theology. To me, the book seems very outdated, with a collection of quotes that do not reflect critical thinking, incisive thought, or convincing arguments. Just doing your own inductive bible study alone will provide far more than this book.For those that really want to be informed, don't waste your money here. There are more helpful books. There are actually some commentaries that are quite helpful, such as Romans 9-16 by Cranfield (available at CBD) and Romans by Witherington. These are meaty and provide solid exegesis to debunk Deformed Theology, I mean, Reformed.

$review_text.: OMG! So... I know im WAY behind just now reading this, but I had to hold off on book buying for a while.Anyways, I think im a little speechless. I finished this on Friday, but I had to wait until today (Monday) to write the review because I just didn't know how to put my thoughts into words.I'll just start at the beginning.Onyx starts right where Obsidian stops. Everyone we loved in the first is back for more. Katy and Daemon still bicker nonstop (in both a god and bad way). Dee is still there, in all her glory, along with Adam and their more serious relationship.The basic story lines here are:#1- Katy tries to convince herself that Daemon really doesn't like her because of their bond (from the first book) But they continue to have steamy on-again-off-again issues. Where they want each other, then fight, then want each other. (kinda super annoying at the beginning- but thankfully, it doesn't last the whole book)#2- new guy- Blake (I will never forget his name because Daemon messes it up like 50+ times) comes into the scene knowing way too much. Daemon hates him because he has the hots for Katy, and because he really just knows way more than anyone else should.  But he wants to (and claims that he can) help Katy to understand and figure out what is going on with her.#3- Katy has issues with her bond to Daemon (from their huge fight with an Arum at the end of Obsidian) which is causing some strange side effects.And...#4- the DOD is coming in hot and heavy in this one. The Arum, though still present, is not the main bad guy this time around. Now we have some serious issues with the DOD. AND... someone we thought was dead... may not be!Overall, I think there was a bit much in the plot going on, looking back at it now. But as I was reading, I just couldn't get enough of it. And the Daemon-Katy romance was awesome!! To. Die. For!LOVED it.Review by Theresa Jones at her blog: [...]

$review_text.: Originally posted here:[...]Flashy Fiction is a very original anthology, with several very short stories which go from paranormal to horror; there are lots of different creatures: vampires, zombies and other weird characters like unicorns and teddy bears. The thing I liked about these stories is that there are always two on the same topic. The anthology has been written by two authors and they challenged each other to write a story on the same subject, but often the stories turned out in completely different ways!Some of the stories are pretty dark, others a little bit lighter and there are some mysterious and creepy. Among my favorites there are Fireflies, Pumpkin carver and Little devil, maybe not the creepiest, but by far the ones that hold a very deep meaning; especially Pumpkin carver, which obviously takes place during Halloween, a very sad and sweet story about a father and his love for his sons. All the stories are fun in their own way; there are killer teddy bears (I will never look at teddy bears in the same way), unicorns standing up for themselves and fighting their sad fate, Walmart people turning into vampires and all kind of zombies. Some stories made me laugh, some others made me wonder and others made me feel that... chill down the spine that you usually get when you read an horror story in the middle of the night at home alone (note to self: don't ever do that again).Another thing I like were the comments at the end of every story. Short and funny, they explained how the story was born or its meaning. It was like having a peek 'behind the curtains', to see how a book is created and they were also very helpful to understand some of the most cryptic stories.Overall, I have to admit that this anthology was pretty nice. Short, with different types of stories, a lovely reading for a rainy, dark and windy night, I mean, for a sunny day. I don't really like collections of stories, but it was good.My favourite quote:To the quiet ones, the trodden on, the kids in the hallThe wolves in sheep's clothing, fooling them all.

$REVIEW.: Armando Returns is the second book in the Barboza brothers series by  Reeni Austin.  It is a wonderful second book and keeps up with the standard set by the first one.  It takes place in San Antonio, Texas.Victor Barboza and Cara Green have come to Texas to visit the ranch on which Victor and his brothers grew up.  With them is Cara&#8217;s son Isaac.  Victor has decided to propose to Cara on the Riverwalk and goes to one of the restaurants to make arrangements for a private dinner.  The manager in charge is Katie McCormack, the ex-fianc&eacute;e of Victor&#8217;s brother Armando.  Victor was away at school when Armando and Katie were together so he doesn&#8217;t recognize her; but she recognizes him right away. Katie sets the plans in motion for Victor and has him tell Armando hi.  Victor does this and sets events he doesn&#8217;t know about in motion.  The other thing he tells Armando is that Katie is engaged.Katie and Armando had wanted to get married ten years before and were running away to New Mexico from Texas when they were caught by her father Judge McCormack and state troopers.  They took Armando and kept him a couple of days in jail then drugged him and took him across the border into Mexico and dropped him on a desert road.  He managed to get back to Texas where he confronted Katie and she broke things off with him.  Neither Katie nor Armando knew why her parents were so adamant that they be broken up.  Now after ten years, Armando has returned to Texas to see Katie before she marries.All three Barboza brothers, Cara Green, her son, and her mother and step-dad descend on the ranch to help Armando and by extension Ramon with the ranch. They are staying longer than planned to find out why the McCormacks wanted to break the kids up years ago.Will Katie and Armando make it this time?  What will happen to her fianc&eacute;?  What will her parents do or not do?

$REVIEW.: I picked this book up for free on Amazon. Cover props must be noted!I LOVE gargoyle books, and Stone Cold Lover is no exception. The hero is gorgeous, fierce, conflicted...and shows loyalty forged by a will of iron. The heroine, on the other hand, wasn't my favorite character. Her prolific promiscuity was a turnoff for me. Yes, she had her reasons, but they just didn't seem plausible enough for me. Others may not care. By the end of the book, she sort of redeemed herself though...or maybe I just wanted our hero to have his HEA. Either way, Stone-Cold Lover is a nice read.

Scott is the real deal when it comes to giving writing advice


He doesn't just give fluffy content - he lays out a concrete, step-by-step plan to establishing your mind set and habits and just sitting down, putting your hands on the keyboard and writing.I'm such a procrastinator, it's taken me a while to just getting around to reading it (sorry, S.J.), but after the first few pages I saw that this book is exactly what I need to get my book started and done

Now I'm sitting here at 5something am - having established this as my best time to write - with my outline of my first ebook next to me on the printer, and I'm clear on what to do, and when and how to do it.Oops...was that a run-on sentence? No worries - the book gives all the info that's needed to deal with all the issues
In down to earth language and real, graspable concepts

In a step-by-step method


 Okay, enough cheer leading..

I've got to get to work.Thanks, S.J.

$review_text.: If a picture is worth a 1000 words, then the sketches drawn by Carl Richards are certainly valuable

Richards' newly published book, "The Behavior Gap," is even more valuable and highly worthwhile reading.Richards has created a very unique and elegantly simple way of conveying financial thoughts by drawing sketches, using a Sharpie pen


These sketches are featured in weekly blog posts in The New York Times
Richards is a financial planner based in Utah.In The Behavior Gap, Richards has done an excellent job of combining numerous sketches with a very forthright narrative of financial topics and life lessons
The book is well written and full of excellent advice, a lot of which is much deeper and more meaningful than they initially appear.Richards clearly writes about topics ranging from the importance of the process of financial planning, as opposed to getting a thick financial plan, to happiness, money, and great conversations, and how all of these are so interrelated.Richards writes: "Simplicity is both beautiful and functional

And yet, people are often disappointed when I propose a simple solution to their investment or financial planning problems


Such solutions can often be reduced to a simple calculation on the back of a napkin..
Our attraction to complexity distorts the way we approach our financial goals
The simple options that have the largest impact and your financial success require discipline, patience, and hard work."We have a number of Carl's framed prints in our wealth management firm's office already


This book will be a valuable addition to accompany those sketches.Disclosure:  I have no financial relationship to the author


I received a complimentary advance copy, so I could make a bulk pre-order.

$review_text.: Having read all of Gayle Forman's books, and absolutely loved all of them except for Just One Day which I merely liked, I came into this with really high hopes. Forman's writing tends to be beautiful and insightful; full of quotes I like to highlight and re-read later. In that aspect, this novella is simply not up to par with her other work. The writing doesn't flow, there are typos, the tone is off. Perhaps it's because she usually writes from a 1st person POV and this was 3rd person, or something akin to it. I understand she wanted to show both Willem and Allyson's thoughts, and some of the supporting characters' too, but it came off convoluted and in the end was ineffectual because I didn't connect with any of the characters.The story felt rushed, even for a novella, and at the same time like there was little plot outside of giving us the information that should have been in an epilogue in Just One Year, which can be summed up as: Willem and Allyson will be together for the foreseeable future. Forever and a day if we're to believe them.It pains me to give this two stars because I do love Gayle Forman's writing and I enjoyed Willem's voice in Just One Year, and the growth his character showed throughout that book, but it can't be helped. This novella wasn't terrible but it wasn't what I've come to expect from a writer of Forman's capabilities. It reminded me of what I didn't like about Just One Day, namely how immature Allyson is, and it felt a bit redundant because even if the ending to Just One Year was somewhat open ended, to me, it was obvious they'd stay together so I didn't need a not-so-polished novella to tell me that.In the end, I wish this series had stayed a duology instead of becoming some weird almost-trilogy. Read it if you're dying to have confirmation from the author's mouth of what you'd already guessed. Otherwise, skip it because the writing isn't great, the feelings feel rushed, and there isn't much character or plot development.

She and Marianne become friends with the young royal prince staying with the King.When Prince Christian notices how different Poppy is from other girls, he's intrigued and happy to spend time with her. Some assume a marriage isn't far behind, but before anything transpires, a young, mysterious, beautiful woman enters the picture.Before long, all the men are falling in love with her and making absolute fools of themselves, while the women detest her. Poppy notices that something's not right. Could the magical protection she's wearing stop her from seeing an enchantment?Seeing clearly, she recognizes the mystery girl as a previously wealthy young lady fallen on hard times. Instead of dancing and enjoying frivolity, Ellen's now forced to become a maid. Can Poppy stop Ellen from making a terrible bargain with a creature who will demand something horrible in return?Just when Poppy thought she'd finished with evil, she must battle the Corley to save the lives of those she loves dearly.One can only hope that Jessica Day George will continue to write more about these charming sisters and their battles with magical, evil creatures.

$review_text.: I would like to thank Kristy Brown and the International Girls YA Book Club for a chance to read this ebook. Although I received the ebook for free, that in no way impacts my review of the book.Meet Kiera, a pretty, intelligent, and talented girl, brought up by her uncle, and abandoned by her parents. Life is as normal as she believes it to be, apart from the deep ache inside her, telling her she&#8217;s different. For years, Kiera had dreams where she ventures into a different reality. She&#8217;s not alone; a presence is always there, keeping her safe, yet she feels vulnerable, and hunted.Zakk, Prince of Zantar, is under the Witch Queen&#8217;s spell as she tries to take over his world. He crosses paths with Kiera, and their fates are entwined.As their journey unravels, she learns that she is not the only one affected by this prince. Who is on her side? Will she find out why she has been chosen? How can someone so young, defeat such evil? Will she find the strength to save the ones closest to her? Will this be Kiera&#8217;s only Quest?Great for MG-TEEN readers.( 9+)This is a very short book, only 85 pages, and yet it manages to pack a fair amount of story and action in such a short time. Kiera is the young heroine of the story, but she is surrounded by a solid supporting cast - her best friends, Maddy, Daz (Maddy's boyfriend), and Joe. Of course we can't forget the loyal Prince, Zakk, nor can we get through the review without at least mentioning the Witch Queen!The opening of the book was a tad confusing to me, as it felt chaotic but without letting me in on what was the norm versus what was the chaos. As the story progressed it did become more linear and easier for a younger audience to follow.Kiera is a good protagonist, and I get the feeling that she will grow and mature quite nicely as her Quests add up. She is a loyal friend, and though she made mistakes she owned up to them, learned from them, and did her best to make things right if she saw they were wrong (either by a mistake she had made, or if she just encountered something that wasn't right). I think that middle grade readers, particularly girls, will find Kiera and friends easy to relate to, which should help keep them engaged in the story.Zakk's story was explained, but only in very broad strokes, so I anticipate he will be playing a much larger role in future books. While the Witch Queen got more coverage, we never did learn what made her into the monster she is today, so again I feel she will be getting more hands on in future books.Unfortunately, I felt that the transitions were often brutally abrup, and not handled as well as they could, or should, have been. It felt as if the author would get stuck in a scene, and not knowing what to do with it, she would simply jerk the reader into another scene with little or no explanation as to why. This book reads more like a draft than a final version. However, I do feel that there is strong potential in the storyline and series, I'm not sure that I will make time to read book two, even to get answers to questions posed in book one. The writing just didn't work for me with the transitions between scenes being crafted as they are. But that is not to say that this is not a decent read for a middle grade reader, or older.

$review_text.: It seems that I forgot how captivating and incredible it is to read middle grade books, until I read and thoroughly enjoyed Ben the Dragonborn


I loved how the worlds are painted, how the characters are bright and so nice to get to know

I adored how much friendship, bravery and teamwork is important and have such a huge role inside the story

It really is a cute and sweet read.When we meet Ben, we quickly realize he is far from the perfect hero everyone expects to save the day


This boy is clueless to what he is capable of since he has been kept in shadows by the very own special school that trains heroes the Guardian chooses to protect other worlds


When the guardian unexpectedly picks him to go to another world where he has to deal, among other things, with his personal nightmare, no one truly expects for him to accomplish it

However, Ben, packed with two new gifts and a mysterious one possibly on the way, lunges bravely (after the initial shock) to this difficult task.Ben is absolutely terrified of water


He is the worst swimmer ever, so it's highly unfortunate for him to be sent into a strange world where 90% of it is water and none of his gifts are of any use to keep himself from drowning


That's where mermaids and sea creatures come into action, and the whole story becomes one exciting adventure.I couldn't stop smiling throughout the whole book, I think it's really good and it made me feel lighter as I read it


It's nice to change reading preferences once in a while, YA books sometimes wear me down with the love angst characters usually make me go through and because of this, I can't focus on the whole adventure
But not with Ben


This book is all for the adventure and forming great bonds of trust and friendship


I'm excited to meet the other worlds that Ben will surely get to travel someday, and most importantly, how he fares with his super cool and born with third gift
I bet you can guess which one it is.*Received a digital copy in exchange for an honest review.*

$REVIEW.: Sisters in a fantasy wonderland filled with excitement and fright?  Having an albatross for your transportation is a unique way to get around, but it sure can have its quirks too.  Mystery and evil is around all the corners and you have to watch your step if you are "Demon".  They start out by testing "Demon" in any way possible trying to bring him down.  He is an expecting father and fights for his life.  The details are exciting and will keep you reading.  This all takes place in the city of Duergaar which is named after the King Dwarven.  Think of it, you are reading about the greatest city of all, a bazaar full magic and mystery and wonderment and creatures that that author, David Andrew Crawford has brought to life for your entertainment.  The book is called "Dark Solus, An Assassin's Tale".  This something that you could read to a grandchild in parts on your special day and you would easily remember what had happened in the story to date.  Of course, be prepared to answer why you cannot do some of the things he can do in the book.  The characters are unique enough to call them out no matter when you pick it back up.  A fun read.

$REVIEW.: I had a very hard time getting into this.  I could not seem to get past the bad dialogue; it was unbelievable and rather disjointed.  As I was reading, I envisioned the author having a shoebox filled with dialogue snippets written on scraps of paper and, (determined to use them all) cramming each in somewhere, regardless of relevance.  This sense of cramming applies to the story line(s) as well. It just seemed as though there were several story lines running through the book, all of them underdeveloped with none taking the lead.  Some fleshing (and culling) out would have made the difference between mediocre and good.The characters (victims all) were flat, neither interesting nor likeable.  I believe that the lack of character development contributed to the "surprise ending" that other reviewer's mention.  Other than one obvious bad guy, we didn't know enough about the rest of the players to wager any guesses as to what they might be up to.The writing seemed to improve in the last third of the book (which I skipped to), but not enough for me to go back and read what I missed.  In spite of this review, I do think the author has talent and the potential of writing a good book.  It just wasn't this one.

This was grittier than &#34;The Runner&#34;, but entertaining


As a father of a young woman runner, this tale is the cautionary one that should serve as a reminder to never run alone.

$review_text.: We're introduced to Kelly as she approaches check-in for Flight 69


Kelly's hero materialises before boarding and takes his seat alongside her

Although British, Thurlow writes cleverly using US grammar, in this fantastically erotic story set in an aircraft bound for Houston, Texas

During the flight, Kelly opts for conversation with the handsome stranger instead of Kindling with `Fifty Shades Darker'.Absorbed in Flight 69, while the buzz of Liverpool Street Station hummed around me, I was in deep at 50% unaware of the time; luckily, the automated announcement for my train penetrated my senses

Talking of penetration, the erotic content of this tale is hot enough to melt your kindle, whilst there is also a deeper message shared with us through Kelly and her response to James Swanson, a travelling companion who offers the perfect alternative to the in-flight movie.Wonderfully written erotica set in business class, but which belongs in first class - all the way.

$SUMMARY.: Belongs in first class - all the way.

$REVIEW.: BEC'S REVIEWSpirits Rising is a novella, making it a rather short read. But that doesn't mean it isn't something that shouldn't be read. However if you are looking for a supernatural romance story of the type that is incredibly popular at the moment, this one is not for you. While Rachel does have a man she pines over there are no romantic relations between her and the man so if you are after romance then this isn't the book for you.If however you are after ancient ghosts of Vikings and natives to the land threatening Newfoundland while Rachel does her best to attempt to send them back to their peaceful rest with the help of a feisty old woman then perhaps you'll find something of interest within Spirits Rising's pages. I know I did. With a mixture of faiths, prejudice and danger this book kept me on my toes over the several attempts Rachel made to right the wrong the son of a man who despised her had done. There is enough substance within this book's short amount of pages to make a very enjoyable, albeit quick read, and one that I am looking forward to seeing being made into a series (as I believe the author plans to do). I am sure there are more interesting tales in Rachel's future and I look forward to reading them.

$review_text.: When I started reading this book I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect.  I was moved from the beginning and couldn&#8217;t put it down.  This is a very touching story of love lost and found.  I was pulled into the story and lives of the Lexi and Zander from the beginning of the book.  The story touched my heart, made me cry happy and sad tears and yes it sometimes made me mad.  All of that put together is what makes it an emotional charged, amazing book!Lexi is an amazingly strong woman, but really never had a chance to experience a &#8216;normal&#8217; life as a child.  She was sent away from her family at a very young age to give birth to her child and become a mother.  She had no choice but to grow up and make difficult choices to ensure help ensure her child&#8217;s future.  Throughout the book we get to learn that everything is not always what it seems.  There are many misconceptions purely from the lack of asking questions and the art of conversation.Lexi and Zander have a very special bond that not many understand just how deep it goes.  Not only does Lexi have many important decisions to make about her son, her life and their futures. She has to face a cruel reality of what could happen and except those potential consequences.Zander has a lot thrown at him and does a pretty good job at taking it all in stride.  In their reconnection after 10 years away, they both make mistakes and people get hurt.  But in the end they both have to decide what is going to be best for the future of their son.  True love might only happen once, but if you lose it can you get it back?Ashley Beale has written an amazingly touching story of true love and the struggle to overcome some amazing obstacles.  It demonstrates the importance of forgiveness; to have the strength and courage to accept and move past your mistakes, to grow and try to live a better life.  It is important to remember that we can&#8217;t change the past but we can learn from it to make a better future.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed this book greatly.  I liked the journalistic approach, the cast of characters as they played out over the book and the authors' ability to let the reader reach their own conclusions based on the facts they learned from the book.  I was pretty amazed to learn that the credit default swap was born of the Exxon Valdez accident (polluted more than we ever imagined) and it was pretty interesting to learn how CDOs were made, then bastardized into CDO synthetics and CDO squared, as well as how they imploded the financial world and why.  The role of the rating agencies is jaw dropping information.  Fannie and Freddie are equally amazing.  I particularly was pleased to learn of Lehman's role in their own failure, which is explained in detail and on the opposing side, how Goldman profited.  I had worked at one of the mortgage lenders that prided itself on making a no doc $1 million loan to a dog-walker who claimed $10,000 month in income and of course, I saw the bomb ticking.  It was never rocket science; you don't get something from nothing.  I thought they failed to cover well the Countrywide takeover of BofA, which I know from having worked at BofA during the SecPac merger would have been salted with some back room deals of which little is known (and is probably not publishable) .  I wrote my master's thesis on the history of the mortgage industry (the impact of regulation) so I am more critical of poor analysis and biased information (aka, Gretchen Morgenson's book).  I think the strongest attribute of the book was that it didn't get into the political arena, because, as we all know, there is plenty of blame to go around for this disaster in the entire political spectrum.  Well done book,  Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: A Not So Barren World is a fun, suspenseful and exciting journey through mythical places and experiences. Author Patrick Hatt brings us the exciting adventure of Jack and Emily and their struggle to get back home to Earth. This story picks up where A Not So Perfect World leaves off but can be read alone if this is the first book you are reading in the series.In A Not So Barren World we pick up with Jack, Emily and Mason and their newly added members of the family Jeremiah and Trudy. They have been living in Olympus with the gods. They are up against new challenges on their way back home including a goddess that wants Jack for her own, a battle with Drazin, and finding themselves in Hell desperate to escape Lucifer and many other mythical beings to return home to their son.Patrick Hatt shines as a master storyteller with his unique ability to blend science fiction with the mythical to create an exciting, original, edge-of-your-seat tale. The characters are colorful, the dialogue enticing and rich, and the suspense unbearable as we wait to discover if Jack and Emily will succeed. I highly recommend it!

The author educates, in an easy to understand manner, the divides among the peoples of the Middle East, especially those fanatical sects that know only one solution to the differences between the people who inhabit those lands.The novel posits a scarily realistic scenario in which the nuclear weapons of Pakistan could be compromised by a group of determined fanatics whose only agenda is to avenge the founder of their Shia sect at the expense of Israel.

$REVIEW.: I am a new reader to Ms. Williamson so I am not familiar with her other work.  I have often heard in certain circles that she is  dubbed a "mystical, spiritual activist." What I like about this book is that she avoids flowery, idealistic, perceptions and Ms. Williamson gives the reader insight into from the everyday mundane to hectic times, occurrences and realistic situations in which the Glory of God can be found.  Anyone can pick up the book and get something out of it, the beauty in this work it that anyone regardless of their spiritual or religious level can relate to it.  One of the few works that I will refer to time and time again for inspiration and guidance.  Having read this work I can clearly see that there are certain universal laws that we (as a human race) must be attuned too if we are to evolve as human beings.  True Heaven on Earth is here and believe it or not, the journey starts from within.

This short novella was packed with tantalizing sexy in as many ways a FMM triad can form. I was wishing I could send out tingles of electricity and /or little flames when I was turned on.Our world is policed by demons who hunt the truly evil and help to separate soul from body. The soul can then be sent to hell. Maron is a lone hunter who's supervisor is "suggesting " she would be more effective if she would unite with two other hunters. Raum and Kobal, a male bonded couple , want to add a female to amplify their energy to zap and part the soul from the corrupt ones. A lone hunter can only hold a baddie in place until back up arrives.The reason Maron is so frightened to bond again is revealed. Can the seductive duo convince her to try again ??Hope you give this story a chance.I am going to check other works by Crystal Jordan.

$REVIEW.: What, another book about selling?No, this is not "another" book about selling. I've read a lot of them, written a few of them, and I can tell you: This book stands alone in a special category.Why? Because Dan Pink was just an eentsy-teentsy bit uneasy about the notion of himself as a salesperson when he started researching the book. He doesn't say so directly, but you can tell, reading between the lines.Now, fast-forwarding to the end of the book, you can see he is TOTALLY comfortable with the identity of someone who sells. As a result of what he learned.That's important -- because most people are uncomfortable with sales, whether that means being a salesperson, doing the act of selling, being sold something, or, in many cases, they are fundamentally uncomfortable that the activity of "sales" exists at all, anywhere in the world.I know, because I sell for a living. I do it behind the keyboard of a computer, for the most part. As an advertising copywriter.You might wonder if I'm selling you right now. My answer is no, and maybe, since I made a decision in my career long ago never to sell something to someone for whom I don't think that something is right; and always to do my best to give a person I think a product or service is right for, EVERY opportunity to consider getting it, so they will get it.That's my definition of selling. Since I don't know you, I would have to break my own rules to try and sell you this book.But I can give you five categorial "if-then" statements to tell you what kind of people I think this book is for, and what kind of people it is not for:1. If you are committed to hating selling no matter what, forget about it. Don't read this book, seeing as Dan will make you hate yourself in the morning, because you won't have any reasons left to keep hating selling -- and all that hatred would have to go somewhere else, now wouldn't it?2. If you like the idea of selling and/or selling is part of your job, but you think you're "just not cut out" for selling, I STRONGLY recommend this book. That's because Dan proves very logically and plausibly that there simply is no such thing as a "natural" when it comes to selling. He also shows that anyone can learn to sell effectively in a style that is consistent with their values  -- a style of selling that lets them sleep well at night.3. If you think you know all that there is to know about selling, don't get this book. You'll be disappointed that there's "nothing new." You have to think that, since you are predisposed to coming to that conclusion, regardless of the facts.4. If you love to learn for the sake of learning, you'll love this book. Because you'll find plenty of new and delightful insights that will make this book worth reading for those insights alone.5. If you are a top salesperson and you want to stay that way, you might as well get this book. It's all but required reading for you. Because Dan makes a distinction I haven't seen made as pragmatically anywhere else. A distinction that will help you sell more and keep you from making boneheaded mistakes that even the best of salespeople could get away with, and frequently did, as recently as a few years ago.The distinction I'm referring to is the effect of the Social Web on everything we say, do, see, think, feel and experience. Yes, everything.Specifically, the importance of all the readily available factual information about products and services online, as well as customer opinions (this one, for example; and those on: Yelp; Facebook; blogs; and the list goes on).To his credit, Dan also provides information in the book about how to prosper in the new Social environment.I was particularly pleased to see that Dan even ventured into the exotic realm of selling that is my specialty: advertising copywriting. He tells a charming if somewhat disturbing story about advertising legend Rosser Reeves, many decades ago. Reeves and a friend were sitting in a New York City park, when Reeves saw a blind man with a tin cup.The man had a cardboard sign next to himself with the words "I AM BLIND" written on the sign.Reeves made a bet with his friend -- that by adding just four words to the sign, he could greatly increase the amount and frequency of donations the blind man received.His friend was skeptical, so he accepted the bet. Reeves then went up to the blind man and asked permission to make the change on his cardboard sign. The man agreed.Reeves added the four words "It is springtime and""Almost immediately," Dan writes, "a few people dropped coins into the man's cup. Other people soon stopped, talked to the man, and plucked dollar bills from their wallets. Before long, the cup was running over with cash, and the once sad-looking blind man, feeling his bounty, beamed."His sign now said: "It is springtime and I AM BLIND."Mention of springtime made passers-by unconsciously (and immediately) compare THEIR situation to the THE BLIND MAN'S. They realized how fortunate they were, and how helpless he was. Empathy kicked in; and purse strings were loosened.The instant and heart-wrenching comparison people made in their minds came from the contrast Reeves (with his trademark diabolical brilliance) set up with those four words: "It is springtime and"Thus, the principle of contrast is vividly demonstrated. Contrast turns out to be one of the most important elements of a sales argument ever discovered.The book is chock-full of other examples that not only give you immediately usable techniques, but also create lots of "aha's" that you can use to strengthen your sales repertoire.As you can see, I'm a big fan.But before I wrap up, a mandatory disclosure...I know Dan Pink. He is a friend of mine. He has written about me in Fast Company Magazine and in one of his earlier books. We once had coffee at Starbucks on Chestnut Street in San Francisco.We also both have the dubious life advantage of having nuclear physicists for fathers.So if you were looking for an objective review, you'll have to read another one. Of course I'm biased in his favor.Dan did not compensate me to write this review, although I did receive an advance copy of the book, at my request.And while I am biased, please understand this: I also have a professional reputation in the areas of selling, marketing, strategy, and entertainment.So while I would not go out of my way to slam this book if I didn't like it, I would also not risk damaging my reputation by recommending any resource on Amazon unless I fully believed in it myself and thought it would be of use, and of interest, to others.The good thing about this book is it comes with a guarantee.  If you don't like it, Amazon will take it back less shipping costs and give you a refund.I hope I have given you enough information to help you make a good decision.

There is a couple of swear words, one I happen to hate. This is intended for middle grade and up and I just don't think swearing is necessary in a young person's book. I have to take away one star due to this, of course if this type of thing doesn't bother you then disregard the loss of one star. I give Public Garden Penny 3 stars.

They don't believe in love or marriage. When they bet his helicopter no less, that they might find love too on Sanctuary Island, they take the bet. Leo, Zane and Cooper are all helping with the wedding, Leo will do a reading, Leo is planning the reception and Cooper is planning the honeymoon. But the real question is, who will fall in love first? When Leo meets Serena, he wants her to assist him in finding the perfect wedding poem. What is doesn't expect, is the attraction they both feel. With both Leo and Serena's past history can she forgive is lie? Will Leo lose the bet? This is a first for me by Lily Everett and I loved it. Can't wait to read more from her.

$review_text.: On the eve of another Marilyn movie, &quot;Blonde&quot;, I pulled this book out of my library and re-read it

 The photos are amazing, and included in the book are official documentation copies that spur furthur contemplation about her death.Will the questions and the responsiblitiy of her death ever be publicly accountable?  I doubt it.For those still fascinated by this lady, you will enjoy this book and find the facts well researched

Look at THESE pictures and tell me she is not one of the most fascinating, captivating, intriguing women of the world
She died in her prime, and she left the most beautiful part of her in everyone's memory.That is SO &quot;Marilyn&quot;, and someone took full advantage of that and of her.

A lot of the projects in here are children's toys/items and/or things he would never have an interest in making. I wish the book was more diverse in its projects, as the title does not specify at all that it is more geared towards projects with the end result being something for a child, or something that seems a bit out-dated.

$REVIEW.: Wow! These ladies are really overachievers! Both stories earned solid A's. I gave The Very Old Man, By Jenny Milchman an A+. The story has an intense suspense level that's tough to build in a short. Ms. Milchman created the edge of your seat thriller, and it is perfect. I loved it. In fact, I wish I'd written it. Drat!Escape From Southern Point, by Libby Sternberg also earned an A. A very solid, not even close to a B, A. This story is a sweet mystery. Humorous from the first word. Very entertaining. I loved it as well.This book is one of the very best reads I've had the dubious honor to review in awhile. The package, from stem to stern, is perfect. Worth every penny (only 99 of them? I would consider paying more for this dynamic duo). An overall AWESOME read.Congrats Istoria Books. Congrats Ms. Milchman & Ms. Sternberg.

$REVIEW.: Not only is Love Potions a fabulous PN romance, it is easily one of the funniest books I have read this year. I enjoyed it hugely and with a sexy Scottish warlock, a stubborn likeable lady, a crazy bunch of relatives and magick it brought perfect laugh-your-socks-off humour and I sat here making very unladylike snorts with tears running down my face. Exactly my type of humour.Lydia Barratt is a bit of a hermit, happiest making her beauty products with her BFF Charlotte and enjoying the quiet life. That is until Erik MacGregor, a deliciously hot Scot moves in next door with his crazy family. He's not looking for love, but something about Lydia draws him to her. Yet she refuses to fall for his charm.Cheeky, witty and, just to confirm, very  sexy, our kilt-clad wooing warlock had me spellbound. His seduction tactics had me sighing, his singing somewhat scarred me, and the banter, tricks and mischief between him and his siblings had me howling. And I loved Lydia as she's no wallflower and is feisty, funny and when it comes to giving Erik a taste of his own medicine it has hilarious consequences. But it's not all humour and seduction there's some suspense and it's one of those treats that has you convinced you have it sussed, only to fail miserably.Whether you are a fan of PN romance or not, this is a book I seriously recommend. The first book I have read from Michelle M. Pillow won't be the last. It was an absolute joy to read and I hope we are treated to more from the MacGregor clan; they quickly proved themselves to be a completely endearing fun crazy family.

The overall construction, dialogue and plot are reminiscent of a 10 year old.

$review_text.: Let's face it. There are still lots of people who don't understand Twitter. I meet them almost daily. Many of them want to understand, and value an explanation. Up until now, conveying the power of Twitter has been a challenge. Well, that has changed with the publication of Shel Israel's wonderful book. In it, he captures the essence of Twitter, relates compelling stories that bring this online community to life, and shares his perspectives on getting the best out of Twitter.So, what is Twitter? Well, according to Charlene Li, Founder of Altimeter Group, who wrote the forward, Twitter is a conversation. This definition, of course, is an allusion to "The Cluetrain Manifesto" and the Conversation Era ushered in by the internet and social media tools. While Israel validates Li's description, he also acknowledges the reference to her "Twitter Village" made in a blog post by Laura Fritton, founder of Pistachio Consulting. It resonated. In his words, "Twitterville connotes a certain homey, small-town feel, a place where you meet people you know as you stroll down familiar streets. These are people with whom you share common friends, interests, and ethics." In short, Twitter is a community - one that is at once everywhere and literally comprised of many "global neighborhoods."Like a local historian, Israel tells us how Twitter came to be, points out its core values and culture of generosity, shares stories of its economy and many notable residents, and he even guides us safely down its dark streets. He concludes his book with two important chapters. In "Tips, Metrics, and Finer Points," he provides advice tips for newcomers that serves as a sort of "Twitter Civics 101" -which actually has applications to conversations in any medium. In the final chapter, "Global Neighborhoods," he provides his "loftier" view of conversations as peacemakers, and discusses the power of personal communications.As an astute business observer, Israel offers perspectives on the ways large and small businesses and governments have harnessed Twitter to become more responsive by sharing timely information and engaging customers and constituents in meaningful conversations. As well, he discusses the role of Twitter in goodwill fund-raising, braided journalism, and personal branding. He also discusses the power of authenticity, transparency, crowd sourcing, lethal generosity, and so much more.Yet, I think it's as a storyteller that Israel shines. And there are lots of stories, each with its protagonists, plot lines, and lessons. From the very beginning of the book he grips the reader's attention with the story of Twitter's origins as a communications tool for a Silicon Valley start-up, Odeo, and its eventual introduction at the 2007 South by Southwest Festival. After stories about how Twitter was used by Dell Computer and Comcast, he discusses customer empowerment in stories about Best Buy, Motrin, and Pepsi.Yet, he goes well beyond big brands to tell us stories about the many creative and practical uses of Twitter, including: live-tweeting surgery, at Henry Ford Hospital, for medical education; the success of The Coffee Goundz, in Houston, in competing against Starbucks; the entr&eacute;e of the Mayo Clinic onto Twitter; Sodexo's use of Twitter as an executive recruiting tool; dissemination of market information by StockTwits; United Linen's use of Twitter to enhance the effectiveness of its Customer Service Representatives in better serving customers; and how well-known nonprofit activist Beth Kanter and lesser-know, former project management consultant, Stacey Monk used Twitter to raise funds for students in Cambodia and in Africa; Oppenhuis de Jong's reports, via Twitter, of the May 2008 Szechuan Earthquake, and Janis Krums' capturing and posting to Twitter the first photo of the US Airways Flight 1549, floating in the Hudson River.In his chapter on personal brands, Israel offers what I'd call "Super Hero" stories of some of the more prominent members of the Twitterville. These are people who are the community's most recognizable and strongest brands based on their generosity as much as their expertise; they include Jeremiah Owyang, Laura Fritton, Chris Brogan, and Dr. Mark Drapeau. Yet, in opening this chapter, Israel references, two very old brands as a way of showing personal branding is nothing new: Og, the hunter, and Guk the fire builder. In doing so, I think he captures the essence of this terrific book: the power of story is nothing new, and Shel Israel has succeeded in crafting and telling engaging campfire stories for the Conversation Era. I highly recommend this book!

It was a bit unbelievable, but it is a Christmas story! To be honest, that's the way I like them (that's why they call it fiction).Real nice character development, I really liked Emma and her friends, I even liked Sam, but I especially liked Goldie who runs Goldilocks (an adult store), she was some spunky older lady!All the characters were fun!I could totally relate to this -&#34;... I was stuck behind one of those behemoth dump trucks with the big plow on the front, snow shooting off to the side of the road about fifteen feet in the air.&#34;  gotta love it! and I don't LOLThis was a very quick short story at only 25 pages... wait, is that right?

I lost track of how many times Alice was taken or kidnapped, and then easily rescued.  Despite all of this, it wasn't an awful book.  The characters remained interesting, but I quickly became frustrated with Alice's immaturity and lack of insight into the three men she has fallen for.

$review_text.: Bruce Blake is a heck of a writer


I was a huge fan of &#34;Blood of the King&#34;, and when Bruce announced he was starting an epic 6-book series called &#34;The Small Gods&#34; I jumped right on board.One thing that's clear from the start -- Bruce had a lot of story to tell


Much of this first book feels like setup for what's to follow, but the world is so richly developed and the characters so nicely fleshed out it's hard not to get caught up in things


Yes, Bruce takes his time with unfolding his tale, and though the first section of the book requires some patience to get through it's easy to savor the details, dialogue and wry wit Bruce has come to display in all of his writing.There are a few minor problems, of course, like the afore-mentioned slow development of the early portion of the book and the excessive &#34;sailor speak&#34; used to narrate some of the chapters, which I found a bit irksome, but overall the good here far outweighs the bad
Unusual, original characters connected by fate in ways that aren't yet entirely clear, a very carefully crafted setting, a simple but effective climax and an ever-growing sense of menace all make this book and this series one to watch

I'll definitely be grabbing Book 2 real soon!

$review_text.: *ARC received for an honest review*I love Scottish romances set in the medieval period. Samantha Holt brings this time period to life in this charming story of a Highlander and the woman he kidnaps. Morgann and Alana knew each other in their childhood, and intrigue abounds as the truth comes to light behind Morgann's kidnapping of Alana. This hunky Highlander is a wonderful brooding hero, and Alana is a strong yet free-spirited lass. Their relationship is sweet and sizzling. This is a delightful story which includes a mischievous faerie attempting to set things right and bring them together.Readers of Highlander romances will thoroughly enjoy.
$SUMMARY.: Magic, love, hunky Highlander and a faerie.

$review_text.: While an interesting read, I hope I do not end up in a teaching hospital anytime soon. What the not so good doctor did could only be considered murderer.  As a nurse for 22 years, I am appalled that anyone would write such a story.  That being said, it was interesting to see how a naive med. Student could go from not knowing what a yankur suction was to knowing how to give a cocktail to kill someone and be ok with it in such a short time. I think it would have been much better for the med student to have turned in the resident when he was planning the first murderer of the patient with the AIDS.  Also, the ending felt as though the writer decided they had better things to do so just ended things abruptly. Disappointing ending for sure. Would have liked for the med student and intern to have been caught and disciplined.

$REVIEW.: When I began reading End Storm I hadn't read the blurb so had no idea it was a zombie book. I think that fact added to my enjoyment. When everything started happening, the sky turned an odd colour, there was an explosion in London and everyone was running but they didn't know what from, I was right along side them, I didn't know what was happening either! I totally put myself in the position Emma was in. What would I do if I was at home with my children and hubby was at work and something like that really happened? Would I wait for him? Would I take my children and run? The thought is too scary to think, I would be a mess!This book is non-stop from start to finish, the danger is constant and somehow Maz Marik was able to pass those feelings of worry onto me. Nowhere was safe and there was no way to relax while experiencing what each of the characters were going through.The big shocker for me was the ending. I did not expect it and didn't like it. Not that it isn't a great ending, it is just that I personally don't like my reads to end that way. Not an expert on Zombie stories, although I have read a few, this one has got to be one of the most emotion building ones I have come across and I highly recommend it if this is your genre of choice.Copy supplied for review

$review_text.: Well, it's on Kindle for kinda cheap and by Liz Carlyle.  I thought I couldn't miss since Ms Carlyle is a favorite HR writer.  Turns out that sometimes you're better off holding onto your money.This novella is fromTea for Two, a 2003 book with two stories, this one by Carlyle and one by Cathy Maxwell.  I had not read them when the book came out so long ago and see that I had not really missed anything.This is not representative of Carlyle's work.  She's usually much better than this.  Part of the reason is the novella format.  It's too short to develop a good story.  But in addition I did not like either hero or heroine.  The hero comes off at the beginning of the story as a dirty-talking sleazebag (although we are eventually supposed to feel for him because he's a tortured soul) and the heroine is for some reason turned on by his sophomoric overtures and has to work hard to resist him.Unfortunately, her resistance is very shortlived and so was my patience with the novella.
$review_summary.: Definitely not Carlyle's best work.

$REVIEW.: This book is not scholarly at all. It's meant to be a sarcastic rant against biblical teachings done in sometimes a really funny way.  I'm always open to reading what people have to say on a given topic even if it's not very academic.  The author does make some really good points on specific teachings that may be considered VERY disturbing.  Overall, I say if you are going to read this book you should do it for entertainment purposes rather than take it too seriously.  I'm going to give this book 3 stars because it was funny, sometimes disturbing, and entertaining. If you are offended by cursing then don't bother reading this book.

You need to truly understand a subject before writing about it. A bit more research on the subject would have helped but would not have saved this story. The 2 star rating is very generous but felt I needed to give the writer something for the effort. Would definitely not recommend this book to anyone!

$REVIEW.: It's tough for girls growing up amid America's images of lithe blonde perfection; girls from non-white backgrounds have it even tougher. So imagine how hard it must be if your father is a world-famous spokesperson for one of Earth's most reviled ethnic groups. Najla Said's father, Palestinian-American professor Edward Said, changed the intellectual landscape with his classic,Orientalism. But that made life only harder for his daughter.Already celebrated for her elaborate autobiographical one-woman show, having toured theatres and schools internationally with her tale of divided childhood, Najla Said now expands that story for readers beyond the stage. She proves a remarkably bold storyteller, blunt in her desire to expose the false face she spent years building. But unlike recent "confessional" memoirs, often lurid in their disclosures, Said keeps her story both personal and touchingly humane.Growing up in Manhattan, Najla knew she didn't fit in with the "society girls" at her prep school. Nobody else's dad got regularly interviewed by Ted Koppel. Despite her parents' pride in their Lebanese-Palestinian heritage, she knew more about Jewish culture than her own. Yet she took these differences for granted, as children do, desperate for life to be normal. But the older she got, the more "normal" became a slippery target.Said's memoir of growing up in her father's long shadow highlights the perils of minority life in modern plural society. She sought her unique identity, separate from her father's magisterial writing, but could not separate herself from the intellectual, heavily Jewish milieu in which she grew. While her father defended his people's rights against Israeli and Arab infractions on the nightly news, she sought a cause of her own.As the Palestinian intifada and Lebanon's civil war colored global perceptions, Said took marked steps to separate herself from her heritage. She longed for the inclusion of MTV and shopping, and joined her Jewish schoolmates in celebrating World War II heroism. But she couldn't stop being descended from a long line of Arab Christians. The gap in her heritage began manifesting in strange ways, including a long-simmering battle with anorexia.Readers must not mistake this memoir for a continuation of Said's father's work. Far from his famous academic dissections and literary rhetoric, Najla unpacks private concerns. She tells her story, not pretending to speak for an entire people. Thus, her prose is often episodic, sometimes choppy, but mercifully free of thesis statements and perorations. Said proves George Bernard Shaw's claim, that only the completely personal can be truly universal.Attending Princeton as Edward Said's only daughter proved a strange new minefield. Everyone expected some genius, some spokesperson for a dispossessed people in the halls of academic prestige--and she just wanted to be an undergraduate. The conflicting forces taking pieces of her spirit left her wondering who she was under the layers of learned response. Sadly, no answers were forthcoming.As adulthood loomed, and Said's father became ill with the slow cancer that ultimately ended his life, Said discovered she couldn't sustain the duality that dominated her life. She couldn't keep her American upbringing in one pocket, and her Arab heritage in another. Especially after 9/11 polarized American discourse, and temporarily made certain racist expressions acceptable again, she had to find some way to reconcile her two halves.Easier said than done.But theatre provided the opportunity she desperately needed. She found a company of similar American-born Arabs who simply wanted the opportunity to tell their strange, conflicting stories. Here, she didn't have to remain eternally eloquent, or be judged as her father's daughter. Her story became one among a chorus of voices, at a time when curiosity and interest in Middle Eastern peoples reached an all-time high.Said's performances have made her a minor star, but not because of some accident of birth. She shows, through simply telling her story, that the personal struggles we all face have their mirror across culture, and race, and class. She has persuaded people, especially young women, that they needn't face their struggles alone. And she had proven to diverse global audiences that her heritage is an object of beauty.Najla Said may not be a famous name, not like Edward Said. But in some ways, she's proven herself her father's truest heir. While he wrote about vast cultural forces that conspired to create gulfs between peoples, she writes about ordinary experiences that build bridges between individuals. We can't ignore the heritage of our births, she says. But we can become the architects of our futures.

$REVIEW.: Riptide is a well written modern story that has everything a good Contemporary Romance & Suspense is supposed to have

It has a great plot, one that will make you speculate and will definitely challenge the reader to draw conclusions

 The characters felt as if you were witnessing a conversation between close friends & known enemies


I enjoyed how well the story flowed and how well the characters were developed.Both Noah & Lauren have gone through terrible times in their life and all they want is to scape from reality and find peace in the Cayman Islands


But the island is far from being paradise


These two characters have gone through rough situations, I really like how well researched and thought out this story was, great details of scenery, awesome job describing the characters' moods, feelings and desires.Their differences and the circumstances in life made them more credible and real

The story feels credible because it feels as if it was brought out of the newspaper


Crime, betrayal, romance and trust are just some of the things you will experience when reading Riptide

There is a bit of everything and that makes the story much more entertaining
Expect a few surprises, great characters, romance and true love.

$review_text.: Leaders Who Make a Difference attracted me for three reasons:1. I enjoy reading biographies of biblical figures.2. I desire to be a leader who makes a difference for the glory of God.3. It was a free download on Amazon. :-)In his book, Pastor Paul W. Chappell looks at the lives of three men of from the Old Testament:1. Joshua: A leader who had vision2. Nehemiah: A leader who brought revival3. Joseph: A leader who finished wellLeaders Who Make a Difference contains nine chapters as well as a short introduction and conclusion. Chapters 1-3 focus on Joshua and are entitled Vision is Developed through Preparation, Vision is Mobilized through a Plan, and Vision is Realized through Provision. Chapters 4-6 are about Nehemiah and are entitled Revival is Initiated by Supplication, Revival is Possible through Synergy, and Revival is Continued through Stamina. That last three chapters of Leaders Who Make a Difference center on one of my Old Testament heroes, Joseph. These final chapters are called Finishing Well Begins with Faith, Finishing Well is Accomplished through Faithfulness, and Finishing Well Requires Forgiveness.It is important to note that Pastor Chappell started the West Coast Baptist College in Lancaster, California, and he pastors one of the largest Baptist churches in America. West Coast Baptist College is unashamedly unaccredited and uses only the King James Bible. All of the verses in Leaders Who Make a Difference are KJV so a few of the verses might be slightly challenging to understand for those who are not familiar with the English spoken 400 years ago. I wasn't aware of Pastor Chappell's background when I started reading his book, and as I progressed through his book I could see I have some secondary theological differences from him. As a reformed Baptist, some of my understandings of God's sovereignty, sin, suffering, and supplication differ from Pastor Chappell, and this stood out to me in his statements throughout his book. Because of these differences, I don't intend to read his books again; however, I strongly believe Pastor Chappell has blessed many people and will continue to do so.

With a growing sense of unease, you'll recognise some of the hideous characters from your previous travails in the Mask of the Macabre and Ballet of the Bones.Beginning with a funeral where Matthew Napier is confronting the loss of his family, you will stumble through the bloodstained gutters of Victorian London to witness a fortune teller giving him and his sister a bleak reading indeed. Once Matthew's sister is ripped from him too, his despair is complete; and he is vulnerable to the advances of pure evil. This is embodied by members of a spiritualist church, and he is confronted by the past in ways even you could not imagine. Is it magic, or murder? Who can Matthew trust? Amid corpses, skulls and ever-shifting masks, you will not know which way to turn. Be sure to keep your own senses sharp as those around you descend into madness!David Haynes's novella carries on from his two short story collections, but also stands alone as a great read.

I was a little lost at first but kept going, it was one of those stories where the beginning is actually kind of the end and is used to set the stage and then the real story starts and winds its way through back to the point at the beginning. Then, it continued a little further past the original start point. Not sure how I feel about the ending, you'll have to decide for yourself. You'll either love it or hate, I think....

$REVIEW.: Now in a completely revised and updated second edition, What Color Is Your Parachute? For Retirement: Planning a Prosperous, Healthy, and Happy Future lives up to its title with rock-solid advice on planning not only one's retirement finances, but also other aspects of retirement - social relationships, personal health, big life decisions, and more. Chapters address everything from making sure the neighborhood or community one retires into is suitable for one's tastes, to solid practices for building "biological vitality" and maintaining one's health, to the value of building social relationships in advance, given that social relationships grounded in work are likely to fade when one retires and there is no "automatic relationship generator" in the third phase of one's life. Highly recommended; it is never too soon to start learning from a user-friendly and practical guide such as What Color Is Your Parachute?

$REVIEW.: This book is pretty much what the blurb says it is: a rollicking Bond-like story about how 007 author Ian Fleming failed to negotiate the purchase of France's navy in June 1940 and along the way came up with some ideas that would later go into `Casino Royale,' `Thunderball' and `From Russia With Love.' I loved the wealth of allusions to the Bond books and the sly hijacking of history to tell what is essentially a popcorn action movie. The writing is slick and stylish and almost every chapter reads like a mini movie. Very well done. Recommended for fans of Alan Furst and Daniel Silva and, of course, Ian Fleming!

$REVIEW.: I loved this book so much I can't even help it.At first glance, I saw this book, and thought, "Aliens? How much lamer could it get?" And how much wrong-er could I be?This book was witty and steamy and it gave me knots butterflies just thinking about it.I'm a sucker for romance and I adored the tense love/hate relationship between Daemon and Katy. It was perfect. And the fact that every other page wasn't a make-out scene made it even better.I completely recommend this book to anyone who loves romance, action, aliens, or any kind of paranormal for that matter. It's brilliant and the writing was so down to earth and exquisite, and with such an amazing price it was worth every penny and more!

$REVIEW.: As a lover of evidence based, yet accessible, non-fiction that delves as deeply into the cultural aspects of a belief as much as the neurological and philosophical implications, I was just so impressed by this book.This is the second in the "50" series from Guy P


Harrison and managed to maintain the same respectful and accessible tone that made 50 Reasons such a fabulous book.50 Popular Beliefs tackles, as the title suggests, 50 beliefs that exist in the world today

From beliefs held by fringe ideology subscribers like those held by creationists and UFO abductees, to the everyday misconceptions that have been mistakenly perpetuated (I refuse to post any spoilers - read the book yourself).The manner with which Harrison conducts his writing is important for any and all authors in this genera, it doesn't attack or belittle, it just presents the evidence in a wonderfully accessible way.I highly recommend 50 popular beliefs that people think are true!

$REVIEW.: I was gifted this book by the author for an honest review. This is book 1 of the Shadow World series by author J.A. Lynch.Giselle Bergman is your typical high school student with a boyfriend. Marc, and a best friend, Alex. Her world is turned upside down by lies, cheating and torment from her piers at school. The 2 people she thought she could trust and always have her back end up not being who she thought they were.I felt sorry for Giselle because she was trying to do the right thing and no matter how hard she tried someone or something always got in the way. A couple parts of this book I got mad at the character because of his actions and then I cried a couple times too.There are no bad parts to this book and even the over all flow feels right along with the interaction of all the characters. The length of this book is just right, not too short and not overly long for a book read.I must say that this book is by far the better of the vampire paranormal books I have read and I say kudos to J.A. Lynch for the start to a great series.If you love paranormal romance with suspense along with vampires then this is a must read for you.

$REVIEW.: West Germany had its East. South Korea has its North. Suppose the United States had its South? This is the intriguing possibility explored by Beneath Gray Skies. The Civil War didn't happen, the South kept its slaves, as a result of which other countries want nothing to do with it, and it is slowly sinking into insolvency and hardship. Until the 1930s, when along come the Nazis, who think slavery is just dandy. The South has what the Nazis want: oil for their industry and helium for their zeppelins. The Nazis have what the South wants: money. A perfect match, unless our heroes: Bloody Brian, the crack-shot British spy; David Slater, the confederate soldier; C, the head of British Intelligence; and a few others can thwart the the two repulsive nations from forming an unholy alliance. Ashton ratchets up the tension admirably and holds our interest to the conclusion. The ending is a bit drawn out and one or two characters were not completely necessary, but on the whole, it makes for an entertaining read. And we learn a lot about zeppelins, which is fun.

$review_text.: I am so grateful to this generous performer who gave the world so much first ratecrafty sophisticated beautiful music that she made her own - there is no debate that they (She?) broke the mold that she was cast from. Helen earned the first Grammy given to an Australian, that I didn't know until today.As well she had a dozen songs reach the top forty in an era not so long ago when radio dominated the media , and it made you feel good to listen to "pop" music.High class with no airs, the author did us all a service when she wrote this reflective heartfelt recollection of her experience as an artist in the 20th century, a working mother who held high standards, worked prodigiously , and left the world a legacy- and truly doesnt have an ego to protect, She reveals herself to be vulnerable and insightful all the way. I noticed that like many artists, she doesn't have much to say about the emotional or intellectual stuff of the songs- which is ineffable, personal, and can be felt and understood only by listening to the music itself.There is much in this book to be appreciated, layers of history, vignettes of another time, in another place.One feels the members of her family peaking through- almost sitting beside this reader.Helen's love of the richness of geneology and history is so kindly revealed, as is her enthusiasm, kindness, compassion, and what I consider leading edge thought. Right on sister!

$review_text.: I must start by saying I haven't read the book yet. I've started, and what I've read so far, I've enjoyed.I bought the book because I recently saw the series, which I found both fascinating and enjoyable. In my experience, there is always a lot left out of a series, usually because of the length of the book, but the visuals were beautiful and compelling.So now I'm going to sit down and read and compare the two formats. Because of the subject, I'm sure I'm going to enjoy it. What I've read so far reads well,  and as someone personally affected by WW2 (my mother took me to Australia under the displaced persons scheme in 1949) I like to read stories about that time and how people's lives were changed during and after the war - as ours were.The reason I've only given the book 3 stars (so far) is that I have only read a couple of chapters. If the book is as good as the series was, I'm sure I'll change that.

He's darker, more depressed than in the earlier books and very close to a relapse. Antagonist Wes McCann is almost his spiritual twin. The reader can feel the tension as they move closer to a confrontation. Moody, explosive and involving.

 I suppose it makes a difference to have been to the monastery in Minnesota where the author went, and to have met Ms


Norris; nonetheless, she has a lot to say


 Her thought-full exposition of the Psalms was particularly helpful, although I would have been happier if she had chosen a more recent translation (such as the NRSV or the CEV)than the often-difficult-to-understand King James Version
 I have recommended this book many times, and continue to do so.

$review_text.: I can honestly say that I bought, paid for and read all 10 books in this series. Perhaps my memory is bad but the last 2 books in this series were really not great. I found that the characters lacked depth and although they were prepared to have sex with their guys, they weren't really ready to commit. The age of the leading ladies puts them at around 30 and most women of that age have worked out some of their issues. I will admit that the music theme is attractive but the characters themselves were not. In this book our h is a 30 year old living at home with no real career or plan for her life. She is musically gifted but suffers from acute stage fright. Our H is a career gambler who has the opportunity of joining the corporate world. They meet accidentally and decide to pretend to be in a relationship so they can both avoid matchmaking. There is a very real connection between the main characters but because of their ruse, there is a whole lot of doubt about the foundation of their relationship.The thing that had me grinding my teeth was the h's mother, who sought to blackmail her daughter into making a stage performance so that her younger sister could resurrect her career. The mother annoyed the cr*p out of me for most of the book and I never felt kindly towards her.I'd only think this book was worth reading if you had read all of the other books in this series. If you're not OCD then skip this one.

$REVIEW.: I got the Jedi Path vault edition a while back, and it was undoubtedly the coolest Star Wars book I had... until now. Let's face it, the Sith are just more fun. Factional biases aside, however, this is at least as cool as Jedi Path.The pseudo-holocron case is the big selling point of course. I've heard some say that they've had issues with it; not surprising- I think the manufacturing quality for these is a bit inconsistent. My Jedi Path vault used to randomly make sounds by itself, which was a bit of a scare when it happened a few times at 3 in the morning. I ended up taking the batteries out. However, I must say my Book of Sith works just fine- and unlike Jedi Path it not only opens but also closes at the push of a button. Very cool indeed.The book itself is slightly different styling from Jedi Path, which was themed as a somewhat beat-up Jedi Temple publication. This one is cobbled together from various authors and eras in Sith history, so the pages have blocked off chunks that don't match. Looks more like a scrapbook in that regard, with different font faces and styles. It starts from the founding of the Sith Empire after the hundred-years darkness, goes to the Great Galactic War (which those who play The Old Republic should be familiar with), and then to Bane's era, then some material from the Nightsisters- not specifically Sith but still interesting. It ends with Darth Plagueis and his rather well-known apprentice, Sidious a.k.a. Palpatine. There's a good deal of scribbled notes in the margins by Luke and Mara Skywalker, Yoda, Mace Windu, Sidious, and a few others. Not as many characters in that regard as Jedi Path, but it makes sense.The material covers everything from Sith alchemy to starships, and is set from the viewpoint of pivotal figures in each era. They're all quite different in terms of both interests and doctrine,As with Jedi Path, there's a few extras included: a lightsaber crystal, talisman, etc. These are all right- mostly plastic though. Jedi Path did have more to offer in this regard.Overall, I'd say the text is a good read, the case is great (assuming it works like mine) and the inserts are okay. Hard to go without this if you're a Sith fan.

$REVIEW.: Still worth owning if you are a Guns N' Roses fan.Here,British journalist Paul Stenning traces the entire career and story of Guns N' Roses--one of the world's most succesful and most influential rock bands. The childhoods of Axl Rose,Slash,Izzy Stradlin,Duff McKagan,and Steven Adler and the musical influences Rose,Slash,Stradlin,McKagan,and Adler have had are both documented here,and there is some really good insight and info into the life of Axl Rose and all of what led to Rose doing some of the decadent and outrageous things that he has done in his life (there is also some "Axl Rose Psychology" in this novel,which reads in both a fascinating and shocking way). Here,you will also get to learn all about the formation of Guns N' Roses,the stuff that went on in GN'R's career and the lives of GN'R band members inside and outside of Guns N' Roses,behind the scenes stories to Guns N' Roses songs,more into what made GN'R so controversial,and there are several other interesting things in this book. While this novel is mostly focused around Axl Rose (as well as Slash),some of the stories in this book that have to do with either Steven Adler,Izzy Stradlin,and/or Duff McKagan are completely fascinating (most of this book has recycled information in it,and there is not too much new info to be found here,but there is a lot of really good info in this novel),and Paul Stenning also documents the whole story behind "Chinese Democracy" in this novel. I always wanted to learn more about the new line-up of Guns N' Roses,the making of "Chinese Democracy",and more on the songs that have been written for the CD(as well as the CDS' planned sequels)and if you want to know those three things(as well as everything else I mentioned in this paragraph)like I did before purchasing this book,this novel has what you are looking for.However,even though this book is very good in several areas,it is very low in some areas also. The large amount of typos in here(I didn't count them all up,but I was able to tell from reading the whole book that EVERY chapter in this book has more than five typos in it)is annoying and just plain ridiculous(there is even one part of this book where Paul Stenning uses a * but then does not say anything about what it is there for),this book does not tell enough about the post Guns N' Roses careers that Slash,Duff McKagan,Izzy Stradlin,and Steven Adler all had and the making of "Appetite For Destruction",and there is a little bit of a setback to this book. That setback is the fact that Paul Stenning is an OK,but mediocre author,so while this book does have several interesting facts in it,the several interesting facts to be found here are told a little bit poorly. Granted,the list of critiscms for this book that are mentioned above does seem long,but the good things about/in this book are all really good and are good enough for me to give this book a four star rating instead of a three star rating(believe me,I did like this book,but I can see where both the good and reviews of it are coming from).There are actually two editions of this book available--an original version(which you can find right here off of Amazon;it has a red cover),and a revised version)(the version that I am reviewing right here).I would definitely say to go for the revised version--unfortunately,it fixes very little(if any)of the typos in this version of it,but it does add a new and good interesting chapter on Velvet Revolver,the new rock band that Duff McKagan,Slash,and Matt Sorum are in with former Stone Temple Pilots lead vocalist Scott Weiland and guitarist Dave Kushner,who has played in several different bands.Despite it's faults,this is a very good book. If you know very little(or nothing)about Guns N' Roses,this book is worth both reading and owning(if you know a lot of information about GN'R and have read other GN'R books,whether or not you want to own this book is really up to you),but if you already know a lot about Guns N' Roses and knew a lot about GN'R before purchasing this book (which was my situation,although I did find a lot of facts in here about Guns N' Roses that I had not known about before I purchased this book),I still do suggest to not hesitate about buying,reading,and owning this novel,even though it does have some faults.

$REVIEW.: This is the absolute perfect book for anyone that has an upcoming wedding or is already in the process of planning
We all know that a wedding is without a doubt one the most important experiences of our lives


Because of this, the planning and care that goes into this special day must be of the utmost highest expectations- no matter whose special day it is! This book delivers the means and methodology of delivering what everyone is looking for to make sure their special day goes above and beyond their expectations

I compared my knowledge that I learned from this book to what my sister had learned from her fancy wedding planner and even she was astonished by the things I came up with after I had finished this book


Everyone wants those dream-like perfect weddings that we all see glamorized in the media and on TV especially, I can personally attest that it's all possible after reading this amazing book, even if you are on a budget!

$REVIEW.: Elliott Mackle's &#34;Captain Harding's Six-Day War&#34; is a rare romantic novel because it is solidly balanced overall and has very high writing quality.  It has a sequel that is just as well executed.Most gay-themed romance novels fall short in the areas of plot development, character development, or feature a less-than-believable setting.  &#34;Captain Harding's Six-Day War&#34; banishes all of these weaknesses easily and excels in the intricacies of its setting. In terms of writing, the story features a nice balance of narration and dialogue.  There are neither too many nor too few characters overall.The action takes place during the 1960s at Wheelus Air Force base in the North African country of Libya.  The overall premise involves the main character, Captain Harding, trying to get to the bottom of the mysterious death of a servicemen.  There are a number of well-developed secondary characters, mostly closeted servicemen, who flesh out the story.  The plot is interesting and navigates through a variety of political, military and personal minefields, running the gamut of people involved from regular service members to military brass of various ranks and all the way up to Libya's ambassador from the US.  As Captain Harding digs deeper, the situation becomes more and more dangerous and suspenseful.Even without the gay characters and romance this would be a very interesting and believable wartime novel.  The author served at Wheelus in the 1960s and his first-hand knowledge of the place and time make this novel really come to life.  Finding a well-written romantic novel is a hard task - this one is definitely worthy of 5 stars.
$SUMMARY.: Nicely Balanced Novel - well-written with solid characters, romance, and plot framed within a well-informed military backdrop

$REVIEW.: I love dragons so I couldn't resist this little novella when it was offered free a few weeks ago. I've read lots of these shorter stories, and this one was better than most. Likeable characters, (although since it was so short, character development was limited), but most importantly, it actually had a plot, rather than being just an endless succession of sex scenes. There were one or two hot scenes, but I would not characterize this as an erotic romance. I would definitely read more from this author.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed this book written by Greg Wright. His writing feels like you are talking to a good friend and listening to his experiences with his kids...which I guess it is. As a mom I found this book fun to read and found a lot of good insights for my own relationship with my 8 year old daughter.I wanted it for my husband to strengthen his relationship with her and I know that he will get inspired to spend that special quality one on one time with her and show her how it feels to be respected and loved by a real gentleman.There were a lot of good ideas for actual date nights, the why behind it and the results from doing them.I know date night is super important in my husband and I's relationship and I can see how beneficial they are for us as parents to spend time with our kids and feel that connection with them.Greg is funny, easy to read and has lots of good insight.I would recommend this as a great gift for a dad of a young tween who is trying to find out how to keep her daddy's little girl just a little longer.

$review_text.: This book is a love story to God. It is a book of chapters that describes our Maker in ways we all need to recognize. People in industrialized nations have learned to cubby-hole our Lord. He is Someone we sometimes visit for 45 minutes on Sunday and then forget about Him until the next Sunday. We fit Him in when we can. We ask Him for stuff when we are in a pinch. This is not who God is. When you read each chapter and see the hugeness of who our Father is, you realize how the enemy has used our lifestyles to pretty much ignore the One thing in life we claim to love the most. This is not an easy read. Tozer who's life-story is pretty amazing in itself, is after you to love God the most of anyone. It is a meaty read. You have to put on your thinking caps when you read this gem, but I promise you, God has your back and when you press into Him He will give you the ability you need to glean a treasure out of this book.

$review_text.: Angel On Fire is one of those books that I had a hard time falling into. As a lover of romantic suspense, I felt 'short-changed' with this read. There was so much potential, but it fell short with its lack of character development and very choppy scenes. For me, I love to "fall" into a story and be absorbed in the world that the author creates, and unfortunately, I never really did in Angel On Fire. With this being her first work, I am sure that Jacque Johnson will have nowhere to go but up and grow in her writing. Best of luck!

$REVIEW.: This was an ok novella... A bit of a let down after reading the Newsflesh Trilogy.What worked:-- I liked seeing the doctors who created the virus and the jerk who set it free as far as understanding how it all began.-- And despite the peeks at the Mason family before Shaun and Georgia became a part of it, the POV of Marigold was most effective at explaining how innocent lives were being affected.-- I liked at the end of each &#34;chapter&#34; they showed the news reports.What didn't work:-- The writing was frantic and vague; I know it was supposed to be a short story, but if a prequel is going to be invented it should add to the story somehow; it needed a little development.-- I wish the cause and effect had been built upon a little more; the Mason's are lovely before the infection and despite the devastating loss of their son I don't really see how they transformed into rating-hungry villains.

$REVIEW.: Part two of the When Hell Meets Heaven seriesAfter their adventures in When Hell Meets Heaven, Private Detective, Olivia Santos and Psychologist Dr Amelia West, open up a new investigation business aptly named When Hell Meets Heaven. Olivia does all the investigating and Amelia sees to the psychological side of their business. Amelia's side of their business hasn't quite taken off though and she begins to question whether she should return to the convent or continue with her new life away from the church.The new case Olivia takes on needs Amelia's input to help her solve the mystery. The situation helps both Olivia and Amelia to solve the mystery and answers the questions Amelia has about their new working partnership.As with most new businesses, there are teething troubles. It's a rocky road for Amelia to begin with, it's nice to see it smooth out along the way. Olivia herself, seems to fall right into the investigation side of the business, but she's not infallible and this is where Amelia comes into her own.Another well written part to this excellent series. It's full of twists and turns and ups and downs with surprises along the way as we follow Olivia and Amelia in their new business venture.At the heart of this book, there is a mystery to be solved and the journey Olivia and Amelia take to solve it is fun, dangerous and with a touch of humor too.Both Olivia and Amelia are terrific characters, they interact well together and have an excellent chemistry between them. I'm really enjoying my second read of this series without the pressures of knowing how it all ends.I love this series and I'm amazed that it's so cheap to buy. Thank you Affinity

$REVIEW.: I do not know why Amazon doesn't combine the reviews for hard copy and Kindle versions of the same books...I have to say that I loved the concept of this book, the characters, and the fact that it was so passionate and engrossing.  I couldn't put it down, and I especially liked that it was a full-length novel.HOWEVER, the book would benefit from some serious editing!!!  The writing should be much tighter and cleaner.  Some of the scenes and dialogues are redundant, and the character development (or switch of personality half way through the book) could have been done much better.With some clean-up and serious editing, I believe this book could be a classic - it could have been extraordinary without all the writing problems.
$SUMMARY.: Terrific, Passionate, Engrossing

After a rocky start between the H and h, they end up getting married after the h is compromised by somebody else, and begin a very sweet relationship. I liked the commitment and development of the relationship between the main characters and it was a much sweeter read, than the previous books.

 I was not disappointed with Volume 2


 In fact, it shows that Bloodshot is quickly becoming my favorite lead character in the Valiant universe, which I would never have believed
 As Bloodshot infiltrates the PRS base trying to discover the truth about who (or what) he is, we are treated to ever more creative ways for him to be nearly killed


 The action in this book is something else


 Definitely not for the faint of heart, this book delivers the gore


 However, I love every bit

 I won't ruin what may be the most gruesome kill in history, but you're in for a treat


 Bloodshot is a unstoppable killing machine, but the author makes you empathize with him which is amazing

 The book's conclusion is so awesome, but an awesome character pays the ultimate price

 I was bummed for weeks after reading issue 9, and I was in complete denial for over a month

 Great book

$REVIEW.: Steve Almond is like a slugger in a slump. Surely he has the talent to hit tons of home runs (read: write best-selling novels), but, instead, we get base hits (read: superior short stories). He doesn't strike out much; he hits well for average, but so far his Hall of Fame potential has gone by the wayside. Where is the breakout novel we have been waiting for, Steve? We know it's in you. This book, despite its consistant string of base hits, is not it. Taken as a whole, this 'novel' is a collection of short stories strung together. Half are written by our hero-to-be Steve Almond, and the other half are written by the beautiful and charming (to paraphrase Almond's description) Julianna Baggott. The stories read like modern love letters written between two protagonists who are kept apart by circumstance -- a circumstance of their own choosing. The protagonists are two desperate 30-somethings who meet at a wedding. They decide, during an akward fumbling moment in a coat closet before they even know each other's names, to confess their past relationships via letters. The consummation of their brief encounter will just have to wait. Instead of spoiling the ending, I recommend you read the book.Through their letters, the characters 'confess' to their previous relationship failures. Each letter (or short story) is a work of art. For example, Almond knows how to slow down a scene when the emotion level runs high; and we experience emotion over and over again in each of these letters, as the characters open up to the failed relationships of their past. I must confess soemthing myself: I've never particularly cared to read Baggott's other fiction; but it is certainly raised to a high level through her work with Almond. I enjoyed her writing here.If you're looking for a template novel with a traditional plot, this is not it. If you're looking for a well-written novel with a non-traditional story-line and exceedingly good writing, then this is your book. It's just not the grand-slam from Steve Almond we've been hoping, for years now, to see.

$review_text.: JUMP moves author Tim Maleeny in a new and intriguing direction. Already critically acclaimed for his popular Cape Weathers series, Maleeny's first stand-alone work is a bit grittier and sexier, combining classic whodunit elements with crime caper attitudes to create a book that is part Leonard, part Westlake, and all Maleeny.JUMP is firmly set in Maleeny's San Francisco, with the action almost equally divided between the uneasy streets of the Mission District and the edge of downtown. It is in the latter area that a death occurs --- the untimely but welcome demise of Ed Lowry, one of the city's most despised landlords. Lowry's departure from this side of the veil is occasioned by his 20-story fall from the top floor of his apartment building. If he jumped, it's a suicide; if he was pushed, it's a murder.Sam McGowan, a newly retired San Francisco police detective, is one of Lowry's top floor tenants, who is still going through the motions of life some two years after losing his wife Marie to cancer. Danny Rodriguez, McGowan's former partner, is assigned to investigate Lowry's death and enlists McGowan's reluctant assistance to interview potential suspects --- McGowan's neighbors on the 20th floor --- to see if anyone had a motive for sending Lowry plummeting to his death.McGowan discovers early on that just about all of them, including himself, had experienced a run-in of one sort or another with the unpopular Lowry. He also finds that they are a mixed and interesting bag of characters: a feisty seasoned citizen and her fitness-obsessed beau; a brother team of entrepreneurs who are selling more than sandwiches through their food service business; a low-budget movie producer; two young ladies with an extremely interesting website; and, most significantly for McGowan, a jazz chanteuse who gently entices him back to the land of the living.McGowan's investigation soon dovetails with one of his former cases, which involved a San Francisco drug kingpin whose tentacles reach into McGowan's apartment building. The two have an old score to settle, and before JUMP reaches its climax, alliances will shift, secrets will be revealed, and McGowan, retirement notwithstanding, will determine whether Lowry's death was an accident, suicide, or murder.Maleeny has always peppered his stories with a mix of quirky characters, but he takes this practice to new heights with JUMP. He strikes a perfect balance between the odd and the believable, keeping the weirdness factor under control while making each and every character, from the apartment security guard to a pair of ill-fated, hapless hit men, memorable and interesting. One of my favorite elements, however, is stylistic in nature. Maleeny ties the end of one chapter to the beginning of the next, even as he jumps scenes, if you will, in the cinematic sense. This takes a great deal of work, but his level of tradecraft is such that he makes it look easy.From beginning to end, JUMP goes down smoother than an Irish coffee at the Buena Vista while providing the same kick, and then some. Don't miss this one.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub

$REVIEW.: Devon Ashley's new romantic suspense novel is an exciting edition to the New Adult genre. Ideal for the 21st Century readership this classy contemporary story incorporates many relatable current issues and elements, which many readers will be able to identify with on a personal level. Recommended for older readers due to the explicit language: mature and disturbing situations and sexual content* Edgy realism that's chillingly acute and exacting, makes this profoundly evocative {rather bold} read certainly a singular one that is not for the feint-hearted! Steamy, sultry and full of heated passion and intensity...the relationship between Megan and Nick tugs at the heartstrings and leaves you hot under the collar.Not normally a book that I would pluck from the shelf, I was intrigued by the `Nearly series' having herd high praise for the author and her hugely popular published fictional works. Nearly Mended is a poignant, controversial and rather impacting story that delves into the dark world of Sex Trafficking and examines the way women are regarded. Main protagonist Megan Whitaker has had her fair share of physical abuse and internal scars that are deeply rooted within and so trying to let go of the past is an enormous feat. I felt such an overwhelming tumult of emotions as her story pierced me inwardly, so as to cause me to care greatly about what happened and eager to read on... Nick {Megan's long, lost love} shows such heroism through his strong bond and love for her; as to melt the heart and really make you think.The thought-provoking narrative is full of such profundity, depth and insightful sincerity as to leave you a lasting mental memory of this unforgettable story.I cannot begin to express into words how unexpectedly shocked I was by Devon Ashley's extraordinary novel, as not normally a reader of NA Contemporary dark romantic suspense and realism. I would compare this series to something of a mix between `TAKEN' {film with Liam Neeson} and `Fifty shades of grey', as the combination of explosive erotica and dazzling romance is as addictive as Chocolate - and my guilty pleasure!Sadistic nightmarish dreams linger on in the mind as one contemplates the true horrors of shaded societies - so relevant to today, which makes for an eye opening read of distinction and striking idiosyncratic prose.*I won a copy (+bookmarks) of `Nearly Mended: Nearly #2' By Devon Ashley through a first-read giveaway on Goodreads. *

$REVIEW.: As the title of my review states, this series is great, but getting very repetitive.  By that I mean that I really enjoy the story line but think it could have all been done in one book if the constant repeating of the characters' thoughts and motivations were left out.  I am to the point of skimming page after page just to get to something new.I guess these authors write these books in series to make more money and who can blame them for wanting to get paid but, I am getting to the point of being more than annoyed at this practice.  If there was more substance in this series rather than endless pages of repetitive material, I would be much more inclined to pay for more of this author's books.  As it is, I won't be ordering any more (even though I truly do want to know the outcome - which, by the way, I can already guess - the good guys win through some last minute twist in the plot but only after going through an entire book's worth of endless battles and betrayals - really???).

$REVIEW.: I did not know it was possible for a book to be this absolutely freaking adorable. From the title alone I was hooked by this book. It is safe to assume I am a fan of Disney movies; the princesses, the princes, and all of the happily-ever-afters despite how realistic they may or may not seem (depending on who you are). Even though the title grabbed my attention right off the get-go, it was what was inside the book that made me fall in love with this story. Cindi Madsen's effortless humor mixed with the hilarious Disney character case studies and two quirky, real characters who totally stole my heart are all just why I fell in love with Cinderella Screwed Me Over.Darby is a character everyone and I do mean EVERYONE can relate to in some way. While Darby's outlook on love is harsh to say the least, I can understand why she feels the way she feels. Despite her negative views on love, Darby is an insanely enjoyable character. I adored her sense of humor and the way that her personality shone through in every situation. As funny as she was what I perhaps loved the most about Darby was the fact that she was flawed. She is cynical, quick to judge, and can be a bit harsh at times and while these aren't necessarily the most admirable qualities, they are all qualities we possess in some capacity. Mix all of these personality traits together and you have one hilarious, quick-witted, AND realistic main character.Darby has been heartbroken one too many times so she builds these walls to prevent it from happening again. Darby's walls in question come in the form of case studies of past relationships. The mere idea of case studies comparing past relationships to Disney princes is absolutely GENIUS. Scattered throughout the book we get to learn about Darby's past boyfriends and the effect they had on her and while doing so we got to learn a little more about Darby.Flash-forward to the present and Darby has all but given up on finding her happy ending but one guy in particular would like nothing more than to prove her long. Book nerds beware, there will be swooning involved. Jake IS Prince Charming incarnate. He is sweet, funny, and most importantly he gets Darby. She does everything in her power to push him away but he doesn't ever give in. He knows Darby comes with a lot of baggage and he as a lot of scars to work his way through but this only makes him fight harder for Darby. Like Darby, Jake comes with his flaws: he LOVES his sports, he can get pretty intense when it comes to work, and proven by his determination to win Darby's heart, he can also be a bit stubborn. But also like Darby, it is all of these qualities that make me love Jake more.Even though these two main characters totally stole the show, I couldn't miss the chance to bring up all of the other characters that make an appearance in this book. Darby's best friend, Stephanie is the voice of reason...even if Darby doesn't always listen. Throughout the story, Stephanie is preparing for her wedding so it's safe to say she's pro-HEA. It was nice to see that someone was there slowly nudging Darby away from her cynical beliefs. I also loved learning about Darby's family and their history. Her twin step-brothers, while their time in the book was fairly frequent, certainly made an impact in two different ways.I guess to sum it all about, this book was a giant ball of adorableness. And I mean this in the BEST way possible. Darby in all of her cynical romantic beliefs, Jake in all of his charming glory, and the non-stop humor that flew off the pages of this book made it one romance you do not want to miss. Especially if you too have been screwed over by Cinderella.

$review_text.: While I did enjoy "Caught By Menace," I still liked "Grabbed By Vicious" a lot more.In the beginning, Naya rescues her friend from being grabbed by Menace and gets caught and taken in her friend's place instead.Naya, who's been been self-sufficient since she was young, is literally shocked that a warrior like Menace could actually genuinely care for her and want her for her and not just her body.  She begins developing feelings for him but when her past mideeds start to surface what will become of their budding relationship?...............Like I mentioned at the beginning, while I did enjoy this second installment I still preferred the first.While I will admit that there is more of a story line as well as an emotional attachment to the characters, notably Naya, there was something about the first book that caught my attention and made me giddy.  Naya and Menace's relationship does have more depth but Hallie and Vicious are still my bias. :DThere was one part though, in the story where my heart actually broke for Naya and made me want to clunk Menace on the head for being gullible and believing the lies.  I almost teared up reading that part. ;(Also, on a side note: I ABSOLUTELY HATED TERROR  IN THIS BOOK!! HE PISSED ME OFF SO BAD!!  ESPECIALLY HOW HE TREATED NAYA AND SHE ALMOST DIED BECAUSE OF HIM!! I KNOW HE DID WHAT HE DID FOR THE BETTER GOOD, BUT HE WAS SO CRUEL AND HEARTLESS WHILE TRYING TO ATTAIN HIS GOAL. I'M NOT GOING TO FORGIVE HIM.I hope the next book is on Flare, the warrior that tried to grab Naya but got injured and had to make a deal with Menace to find a bride willing to be with him since he is now disabled.ORHazard.  Hazard looks like he really wants a bride and wants to enter the Grab but had most of his points taken away.So yes, Flare or Hazard for book three please!!

$review_text.: I don't often come back to review the books I download. Takes too much time. But this book captivated me completely and I find the need to tell others how much I enjoyed it.. The storyline is written in the Quentin Tarantino style hopping back and forth in the timeline until it all ties together at the end. The concept was pure genius. The mathematical & scientific explanations were perfect. Enough that geeks like me will be totally intrigued, but not enough to lose someone who is less likely to understand the relevance.And the sex... what to say about the sex? The story is written by a man, from a man's perspective. And yet I, a woman, was completely entranced. Enough that I may or may not have found myself wet and throbbing with an intense need...I downloaded this story in the Erotica section and found to my utter delight and amazement an actual story. One that I, quite literally, couldn't put down. I downloaded it yesterday afternoon and stayed up until 3 a.m. today. It drew me in, pulled me along and I was so pleased with the ending that i literally squealed with delight.I hope you check out this story. You'll find it to be an instant favorite.TO THE AUTHOR (because I know you read your reviews): I loved this story and you are at the top of a very short list of authors that really speak to me. I can't wait to read more of your work.

$REVIEW.: For a novella that hasn&#8217;t the support of a previous full-length novel, Burn for Me is tight and has all the elements I love to find in a Brazen read, i.e sexy guy, feisty lady and passionate extra-curricular activities. I have to confess that Lauren Blakely is a new author to me, but if this is anything to go by, her novels are certainly on my radar now.Smith Grayson and Jamie Lansing are best friends. He is all man; sexy, buff, a little rough around the edges, has a dirty mouth, but is absolutely adorable with it. And the icing on the cake&#8230; he is a Firefighter. Yes I am one of those women who has a thing for he who saves kitties from trees.But he isn&#8217;t Jamie&#8217;s type - she wants the hearts and the flowers and a man who will recite Shakespeare to her whilst they lay in a bath surrounded by bubbles and candles. But when Smith asks his bestie for a dance at a party she discovers that the Bard&#8217;s words are beaten by Smith&#8217;s Ode-to-Sex&#8230;&#8220;If you take off anything else, I am going to be f****** you. Got that? This is your warning.&#8221;And once she has a taste, she wants more and proposes a no-strings week of horizontal and vertical pleasure.I wanted to shake some sense into Jamie for her stubborn denial and launch myself at Smith as he was such a dirty sweetheart. Their chemistry was excellent and with sweet touching moments combined with passion, I devoured it in one sitting. Plus with introductions to various secondary characters, I&#8217;m hoping that there will be more romps involving Firefighters. A steamy seductive short read I recommend.I received a copy of this courtesy of Entangled Publishing for an honest & unbiased opinion

$REVIEW.: I was sorry this series ended.  Last fall I read Dominic's Quest without reading the first book, The Red and Savage Tongue.  So I got the first one, and reread the second one (Dominic's Quest) and then the final one, Badon Hill.  This is an exceptional author and love the writing.  I got totally involved with the characters in this series.  I would like to see this continue, but I fear this is the end of Dominic's story.  It was a thriller filled with sadness, agony, heart-stopping suspense, outrage - it pushed every emotion possible and couldn't wait to return to the story.  I noted this author doesn't have any other books available, so I'm guessing this is the first, and what a future this author has, and what a fan I have become.  PLEASE continue on, whether it's with Dominic or other characters.  Your writing is superb.

$review_text.: In Shadowed (Dark Protectors #6) by Rebecca Zanetti, Vampire Jase Kayrs has been plotting revenge on the demons who tortured and held him captive since the moment he was rescued. As it turns out, the time to make his move may be fast approaching. Jase has a chance to help witch, and ally, Brenna Dunne by mating with her, increasing both of their already substantial powers. He also credits Brenna for being one of the biggest reasons he didn't give up while the demons tortured him.Jase always did have a soft spot for the petite witch and now he just hopes he doesn't hurt Brenna, physically or emotionally,thanks to his uncontrollable rage. As he prepares for more battles ahead with their enemies, he begins to actually feel emotion for the first time in ages. Could Brenna be the key to letting go of his past?Brenna Dunne is racing against time before two events change her life forever. The suggestion that mating with the object of a former crush, Jase Kayrs, will help her seems ridiculous. However, Jase is one of the most deadly soldiers on earth and an extraordinarily powerful vampire in his own right. Brenna worries that if she agrees with the plan, she may lose her heart to the tormented man and end her chance at finding love in her lifetime.The latest offering in the Dark Protectors series, Shadowed, is a dark, intense paranormal romance that had me mesmerized. With passionate writing and engaging characters, Rebecca Zanetti has once again given us a story to remember.Book six in the series can be read as a standalone if you've never explored this world before, and I think you will still have a good understanding of the how the characters fit together without getting lost. I really enjoyed Rebecca's writing style again, as it seems to beautifully convey the character's emotions. Especially with Jase and Brenna--their desire for each other and how swept away they become with their emotions comes across perfectly to the reader.Even though the plotline for Shadowed is based on rather dark events, there was still a nice smattering of humor and funny moments included. Some of my favorite scenes were those that included a lighthearted touch: the meeting for the negotiation of the terms of their mating, and Brenna and Jase's sparring session. Poor Jase! lolI think Rebecca did a nice job showcasing how much Jase went through at the hands of the demons and his struggle to try to get back some semblance of his former carefree self. It was heartening to see his family stand by him through it all and to see how strong Brenna was in the midst of the chaos.If you're a fan of paranormal romance, I think you'll really enjoy Shadowed. It is a touching story filled with drama, heart-racing action and lots of magic.

$REVIEW.: Hello, my name is Amber - and I'm not really among the target audience for a sci-fi novel

Despite my lack of enthusiasm for the genre, I can be won over with great characters and some romance
And while Ransom in the Rock didn't have quite as much romance as I would have preferred (though there are some sweet scenes in there), I did enjoy exploring the frontiers of Anderson's imagination and meeting some of the characters who populate the interesting worlds she's created.The story begins with Lileela - a stubborn, self-absorbed, and often silly extraterrestrial teen


Not having read Books 1 and 2 in the series, I didn't have any prior knowledge of her character or her family, but I was able to follow along rather well


Interestingly enough, I believe Lileela won me over the most as the story progressed


Yes, she got on my nerves

(I confess her family did, too, on occasion, even though I'm not sure they were supposed to.) Yes, she needed a big attitude adjustment


But her authentic struggles with selfishness (something that's sadly easy to relate to), as well as her insecurities and her genuine emotions, made me invested in her story and curious to discover how her choices would play out.As for the rest of the cast, it's an intriguing bunch! I'm not entirely sure I &#34;like&#34; them all, per se, but some of the points they make about faith are certainly thought-provoking
I really would have enjoyed having the climax meeting/revelations happen earlier
As it is, while there's plenty of conflict and a bit of action, this installment does feel sort of like a bridge between stories, rather than a completely satisfying story in its own right (in that I wanted to know more about what was coming, and a lot of interesting events seem to have occurred before this particular book takes place).The &#34;alien&#34; terminology was rather prevalent, and one revelation left me a little confused as to its implications


Even still, I was pulled into the drama and engaged by the writing
I imagine fans of the first two books in the series won't be disappointed, and those who enjoy inspirational sci-fi and the like should find &#34;Gateway to Gannah&#34; to be a clever series


(From what I can tell, reading the series from the very beginning would definitely enhance the enjoyment of each read!)*With thanks to the author for providing me with an e-copy of the book in exchange for my honest opinion.*

$REVIEW.: "The Church and the New Media" is a prophetic call for the Church to use the new media as a means of proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ. Following the call from Pope Benedict XVI and others, the authors of "The Church and the New Media" give a vision for just how to do this. The book is written by and for Roman Catholic Christians in particular, but there is a lot of material here that other Christians could benefit from.As a priest, professor, and writer interested in using the new media for the glory of God, this book is one of many I've read on this topic. Because I've read many similar works, there is a lot of this book that isn't particularly new to me - but which may be to other readers. If nothing else, the book should help motivate Christians to use the technology at our disposal for furthering God's Kingdom.There are 12 chapters and an Introduction in the book, so a variety of topics are covered by the different writers represented in the text. While the authors definitely give a vision for why the Church should use the new media and also give specific ways in which they've used it, what's lacking is a more practical discussion of how to use the new media. A lot of the writers cover the same material - they tell us what their blog or website is about - but none of the writers do a particularly good job of explaining how to develop a website or blog and get people to read it.Overall, the book is great to inspire and encourage Christians to use the new media but not as good on giving details for how to do this. The vision is clearly laid out and passionately presented, but a greater diversity in the kinds of articles included would have been helpful. Finally, it wasn't clear to me when I ordered the book that all of the articles would have an exclusively Roman Catholic perspective. There's nothing wrong with this, but this means that readers from other Christian traditions can't directly apply a lot of the material since they don't have access to the wonderful resources of the Roman Catholic Church.

I love a man who knows how to work with his hands and Tyce can work those and more? If you love romance with some steamy sex, you will love this book

$REVIEW.: After all the 3 star reviews, I wasn't sure about this. But I do like this book (would've been 4.5 stars, but for the somewhat poor editing - the father you get into the book, the worse ir gets). In some ways, it's a typical romance novel, but on the other hand, it has a raw quality to it that resembles a real-life relationship more than any other romance novel I ever read. There's no need to suspend disbelief - the characters are that real. Go ahead, read it and judge for yourself!

$review_text.: I found this to be both a quick, fun read and an interesting introduction to the loosely connected "Northern Shifters" series.  I loved how the story showcased the vulnerability and desire of the young, gay human protagonist in a dangerous world.  Fighting his own battles with his libido, a bit of homophobia around him, and a dark encounter in the past, Alec struggles against a potential relationship even before he becomes aware of all of the dangers of the werewolf world.  The protagonists' desires for intimacy are nicely interwoven with "normal" reservations about relationships in addition to the need to survive in a world with extremely dangerous and predatory wolves.While overall the writing isn't superb, it was refreshing to see both paranormal and more typically "human" issues wrapped together, including a sometimes halting introduction of a gay protagonist into the very threatening and possibly rewarding world of werewolf mating.
$SUMMARY.: A human endangered and loved by werewolves

$REVIEW.: This is an amazing series of books and for once, the ending didn't suck- it wasn't tied in a neat little bow at the end, it didn't jump way in the future and make everything rosy- it felt like you were Eden's best friend or someone who stumbled onto her journal, it just &#34;felt&#34; right. I have enjoyed this series and read all three books back to back. I rarely read the second book in a series and if I read the third or beyond it's usually more because of a sense of duty (I've come this far- mine as well finish) but honestly, I cared about these characters so much I just HAD to find out what happened! Ms. Stewart is one of the most talented writers I've run across in a while. Mitch and Eden seem like they could be your quirky next-door neighbors or that &#34;crazy&#34; friend of a friend. Don't hesitate to purchase this series (in order though!) it will be time and money well spent!

$review_text.: Written by radio commentator David Hurwitz, Sibelius the Orchestral Works An Owners Manual is a book and CD set celebrating the classic creations of Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. The text discusses Sibelius' musical language, symphonies, violin concerto, tone poems, theatrical music, and more, while two full-length CDs offer a beautiful cross-section of not only Sibelius' work, but also the compositions of his contemporaries and successors. An in-depth, at times modestly technical analysis, written especially for dedicated music lovers and musicologists, and a "must-have" for anyone interested in learning about and experiencing the Finnish master.

$review_text.: I liked this story very much, but strangely it was due more to the secondary character of Dan than the rest. Let me explain, without going through all the story.The romantic element of the story between Jacob and JT worked. JT had his moments when I wanted to slap him, but then he did the big gesture and the right thing and he almost completely redeemed himself. I don't know if he's 100% trustworthy, but he pinned his heart onto his sleeve.Jacob was an interesting character. His jokes are a bit untimely sometimes, but I believed the portrait the author did to him at that point in his life. I don't know if I could really say that his character has a story arc, I don't know if he's really in a better place in his head than he was at the beginning, but he took a conscious risk, I don't think he will be a passenger in his life again.As I said before, Dan, Jacob's brother, is a great character. I liked his humor, the way he doesn't sugarcoat his opinion, he's blunt and driven. It's clear that this might lead to trouble, he denied himself something important, but in few pages we have a portrait of a complicated man, with lots of shades and facing questionable choices. The closeness between the two brothers is just beautiful, you could really experience the depth of their love which comes from having endured the same problems and having survived them.There are a couple of things that are worrying me and I guess they'll play out in the next installment. First of all, I didn't like how Jacob was so ready to judge his brother for the cheating thing, I was expecting him to be less judgmental. Second, I didn't like the way Cam was talking to Jacob about JT, as if JT were the most untrustworthy man in the world. I know he meant well, but the way he insisted on it was stinky.A gripping story. I love this town.

$REVIEW.: The Academy (Book 1) is one book you don't want to miss reading.  Chad Leito has created a realistic fantasy world where the future is set in the modern, where things are the same but not the same, and where moments can change and transform in a heartbeat.  While the Wolf Flu is obliterating the population, a secret organization is also kidnapping 15-year olds for the Academy's dangerous and rigorous recruitment process.  Asa Palmer is not only a victim of the Wolf Flu since he is an orphan, but he also becomes a victim of the Academy.  Will he survive the treacherous training the Academy has in store for him or the mutative surgeries they perform on him?  Will he persevere through the mind-numbing competitions with other kids his age, and does he even want to once he finds out what the Academy really is?  This book is refreshingly well-written and is a real page-turner.  The cliffhanger in this book will leave you begging for more and Book 2 will not disappoint.  I highly recommend this book!

$review_text.: My biggest pet peeve in books is when authors write unlikeable characters that we're supposed to like. Rand, the male lead, was one of the most unlikable lead characters in a romance novel I've ever read. I know this book was written many years ago but I have to believe men didn't behave like that. He is selfish, mean and a bully basically. Why would anyone fall in love with him? Then stay with him after he repeatedly says he wants you gone? Save your money, get htis from a library if you really want to read it.

$REVIEW.: The Rift series combines many of the things I like.First, zombies: I don't really know why, but zombie stories have always appealed to me, and Robert J. Duperre's way of tackling the subject is original and refreshing.Second: good stories. Might sound obvious for a reader to say, but managing to pull it off is not always easy for a writer to do. The Rift's storyline is complex and ambitious, yet it never gets you lost, just hooked and wanting to know what's going to happen. I also appreciated the fact that from the start, the author told his readers that there would be four books: he knew where he was going and how things would finish. I prefer that to The Walking Dead, a comparable piece of work on many points, except that now it's turning in circles.Third: solid characters. The Rift is not a succession of action scenes only, and the zombies actually matter less than the humans, whose thoughts and relationships offer the novel its depth.Fourth: style. Duperre's prose is literary without being pompous, is well-polished without seeming unnatural. You always know there's been a lot of work on the author's part when complex things read easily.Fifth: talent. That's the one thing not many people have. I discovered Robert J. Duperre completely by accident, and I've kept wondering what makes an author famous or not ever since. How come he's not selling millions already? Because in my opinion, he deserves to be.

$REVIEW.: I read this book over the course of a few days


So it must have been okay

I don't think I'd read another Mycroft book


So it must not have been too great.For the first few pages I couldn't tell if this was a first or third person narration; did Mycroft have his own Watson, or was the narrator just a story teller? Eventually, as the narrator didn't introduce himself, it turned out to be a third person narrative

Maybe it's my expectations from that other Holmes writer; I've never had that problem before.Mycroft wasn't particularly well-drawn in the story


He's not particularly driven, he's got no demons, and he isn't an engima


Just some guy who sends off telegrams

His assistant and the street urchins are drawn at least a bit more interestingly.The banking crisis had easy solutions that would have been profitable and satisfied all those involved


These were not explored.The real problem is the ending
After every exertion and the distress of bankers and politicians, after the rat catchers and street urchins and telephone repairmen have gone through their pains their efforts fall short
They are doomed

But fortunately, a solution drops from the sky
I'm sure the bankers went out of that final conclave thinking "and I missed my bridge game for this?"Overall: it's a good book for a day when you aren't feeling very discerning and want something easy to read.

$REVIEW.: Frederick Douglass for Kids is a beautifully crafted book, in writing and layout. The scope of information is very impressive and is compiled in a way that is enjoyable for youth and grown-ups. The writing is jam-packed with facts, but written in a semi-narrative style, in some instances describing the emotions Frederick must have felt in the given situations. The pictures in the book are mostly black & white photographs, many taken by the author while researching for the book. There are also many fact boxes in the book that highlight other important people of Frederick Douglass' time that he had interactions with. The activities featured in the book are spread throughout alongside the piece of history they relate to. They are varied enough that there is something interesting to do for everyone. This book is great for a classroom, home-school, or an individual!

This book is AWESOME


It speaks to the heart of God


If you a pro-life, this will give you resolve and a urgency to seek a God-given courage to stand up for life
If you are Christian but are pro-choice, I urge you to read this and understand this is a calling


John Ensor had started the premise of this book by stating Satan's plan


It is understandable and evidence from the word proofs it to be true

Ensor uses a foundation and builds up to the abortion issue that is splitting this country apart and Christians as well.

$review_text.: I received a copy of this book free and I was very excited by the title and description
 It is indeed a creative back story of an old fairy tale
 However, it is very hard to follow the characters and the time line (chapters jump you back and forth)


 I found the story difficult to read and would often step away from the story for a day or more before picking it back up again
I did not connect with any of the characters, so I did not care if they lived or died
 Consequently, I will not be reading the sequel.

$REVIEW.: I was expecting a horror story. I should have paid more attention? Certainly, the atrocities committed on lead character Caitlin would be considered worthy of any horror story had these acts been fully described; alas, they weren&#8217;t.  Still, the premise was enticing and the beginning absolutely hooked me. I started to get edgy with concerns about verisimilitude when the male lead, Nathan is allowed to stay in the same hospital room with Caitlin. There are several reasons why I simply couldn&#8217;t believe this - he isn&#8217;t a relative, he was a suspect to her kidnapping / rape, and Caitlin is underage. Maybe it would be the norm in Australia?  A lack of realism continued to haunt me, from Nathan&#8217;s purpose to his employer and the actions of the police.I read on, hoping to eventually find the anticipated thriller read but by the time I did find an inkling of plot, I was lost in a quagmire of Caitlin nightmares, followed by condolences and promises that followed the theme, &#8220;they&#8217;ll never hurt you again&#8221; by Nathan. All of this was confounded by Nathan&#8217;s ever present thoughts of sex with Caitlin or the nurses. Men are often accused of having one track minds regarding sex, but Nathan was truly a champion in that regard and as such, grew tiring.Ms Carlton is an extraordinarily good writer, so I&#8217;m at a loss.  I must have missed some clues, some cleverly hidden innuendos that would have unclogged the arteries to the brain, bringing enlightenment and that, oh so welcoming sigh of contentment for a story well read. Believing that that has to have been the case, and confident in the talent of this author, I'm off to read another of her novels... something about Mermaids.

$review_text.: In Democracy in America, de Tocqueville once observed that there is not a serious American social issue that does not sooner or later resolve itself into a dispute before an American court of law.In this way, America has mirrored western society itself which has been characterized not just by the spectre of trial but significant trial and error in relation to the pitting of the mighty Goliath of state against the supposedly puny David of reform

And so, Galileo in the dock was much of a piece with Joan of Arc in the dock, Socrates in the dock and of course, Jesus in the dock.It therefore nothing short of surprising to see an author actually stepping forward to essentially argue the side of the inquisition

Essentially, Rowland's thesis is that ultimate objective truth is unknowable and therefore no one -- scientists included -- should have a monopoly on defining it


Rowland argues that it was "Galileo's Mistake" to claim for science the sole perogative of explaining the whys of creation.And amazingly, science's scrupulousness is actually a first witness in support of Rowland's thesis

Thanks to the limiting discoveries of science like Darwin's natural selection (which says evolution has no ultimate purpose in mind and varies its results based on the environment), Einstein's relativity (which says that your now is dependent on your state of motion and proxmity to great mass), Heisenberg's uncertainty (which says we cannot know both speed and location of quantum particles) and Godel's Theorem (which says that even mathematics itself cannot be relied upon to disclose even all mathematical truths), we can indeed say that there is no objective reality.And more troubling still is the solopsist dilemna

Descartes' "Cognito ergo sum" ("I think therefore I am") is not so much a statement as a guantlet to objectivism
Any belief in external phenomenon is just that...an act of faith


In this way, all observationalism is a choice of faiths

What evidence, after all, can really be accounted to describe reality

And in what mixtures.So far so good for Rowland.However, where Rowland falters is in equating the power of Galileo with then existant power of the church.Galileo was not a head of state
He did not maintain a judiciary


Indeed, he had no other means at his disposal to enforce his viewpoints than through the strength of his eloquence.To the contrary, the Office of the Inquisition was very well empowered to secure compliance with its edict


Just three decades before Galileo in fact, it had consigned Giordano Bruno to the flames for believing that the universe was infinite.To restate it more simply, the church had and was using the power to enforce its monopoly on reality

As such, it was impeding the search.As pointed out in his book, science has been often wrong in its suppositions about reality
However, where it is right is trying to base its faith judgements -- its whys -- on the strength of objectively provable evidence.In this way, Rowland was genuinely unfair in his characterization of science as being essentially a faithless endeavor
Perhaps the most noted scientific atheist of recent memory, Carl Sagan, produced one masterwork after another litterally gushing over the beauty and enormity of the cosmos and our place in it.To be sure, while scientists may have their book of nature, others can and should have the perogative of their books as well
Everyone can and should be free to approach reality on their terms consistent with their faith and in a manner which does not impinge on the free exercise of others conscience.Despite Rowlands "mistakes" his book is nonetheless important food for thought

Based on his writing he deserves five stars, but at the end of the day he now maintains a position that even the Catholic Church itself does not defend (to its credit)
So some points were deducted because after all being wrong does have its costs.

$REVIEW.: There are many simplicity books out there written from the perspective of those who were spendthrifts and/or packrats, but who have now seen the light.Taylor-Hough writes her book from the perspective of a woman for whom simplicity is a way of life and always has been


There is no fluff about how to buy the expensive for less, or how to find self-respect in one&#8217;s new lifestyle

The author presents nothing more than the desire to share the joy that is born from living the life of less.The only hitch that we encountered was that Taylor-Hough choose to include information on how to eliminate debt and work with financial difficulties

We agree that this issue must be overcome to truly appreciate the simple (or any kind of) life, but the subject is so massive that the chapter ends up sounding somewhat trite

We believe Taylor-Hough would have been better served to refer the reader to a book with a more comprehensive approach to the subject, such as Mary Hunt's cheapskate series.Other than that small point, the book will prove to be one that is examined and re-examined often whether you are just entering the philosophy or whether you have been a practitioner for a long time.

I do tend to like more graphic sex scenes, but for this type of book the scenes were more graphic than many others I've read. Will definitely keep up with this series.

The characters were a little bit stereotyped, but not so much that they detracted from the story.

$REVIEW.: This story was cute

 It followed Claire a hard working architect and her most eligible bachelor in the city boyfriend David

 From the outside they appear to be the perfect couple however looks can and are deceiving

 David feeling the pressure to put up the perfect image for his father and his company decides Claire is the perfect girl to impress his father so that he will be next in line when his father decides to hand over his company

 Only problem is that David has fallen for someone else, a much older someone else that he knows his dad will not approve of
 In the meantime, Claire has come to discover her very good looking upstairs neighbor Alec who is too gorgeous to just ignore


 Claire being the committed girl she is chooses to blow off Alec and be somewhat rude even though she cannot deny the attraction she has for him
 This story was good however I was a little disappointed that the story focused so much on the relationship between David and his mistress but did not dedicated nearly enough time on Alec and Claire

 Still it was a good read, just wished we got to spend more time with Alec, and David is an idiot who gets way too much of our time! :)

$REVIEW.: Living in the highly diverse and volatile economic world that we live in, amplified by the current world-wide recession, it is not surprising to see many scholarly essays arising to address said crisis.  What is surprising, however, is where this group of essays comes from.  "In the Rivers They Swim" ("Rivers") is a collection of essays on economic development in the third world (not just African as it would seem from the cover and back)  from a highly diverse group of individuals ranging from former Swiss Guard internet boom recipients to the current president of Rwanda His Excellency Paul Kagame.  Even evangelical author Rick Warren (Author of The Purpose Driven Life) had a hand in Rivers as he wrote the introduction.All authors, despite their highly diverse economic, spiritual, and cultural backgrounds, all offer their insights on raising economic prosperity in the third world and, in turn, make one point very clear in unintentional unison- it never is one thing.  Throughout all the very short essays I noted that all economists seem to agree that there are several aspects to bring about success in even the most impoverished of nations, although they also seem to agree that foreign aid is a short-term solution but a long-term problem.The essays are organized into three phases; the journey, strategies for success, and globalization.  This allows for a very consistent flow that does not distract or bore the reader, a real issue among academic journals.  Consistent flow and interesting content is amplified by how short the essays are.  The essays, on average, are 5-7 pages long.  This is barely a graduate level book review length, however, nearly all the authors were VERY concise and to the point allowing just enough information for the audience to be relatively well informed.However, this does present a problem.  With such a short length per essay, the authors cannot go into such detail as to show more specific examples beyond generic referencing.  Not to mention there were hardly any citations at all.  In fact, there was NO bibliography making me wonder just where many of the authors got their figures and graphs.  On average, the essays had 1 citation max.  Granted Rivers is designed as an organizational textbook and the majority of the essays are more-or-less memoirs, HOWEVER, if you're trying to advocate a policy, you need to back up your argument with facts and not anecdotes.Other than that, Rivers is an excellent read and the points are worthy of recognition and deserve another glance over by the powers that be.  I just wish they would back up their arguments with more facts.

$REVIEW.: Packer's book on the Articles of Religion is not a study of the articles themselves but a lament over their disuse and the attitude of indifference toward them that seems to pervade Anglicanism
 The result as Anglicanism has developed over the last 175 years or so is an increasing pluralism of beliefs within Anglicanism and a doctrinal "incoherence" unparalleled in mainline protestantism.The book begins by simply reprinting the Articles without comment
 Packer then speaks of the "silence" of the Articles in present Anglican life


 They have simply been muffled and shunted aside

 He recounts their history briefly, grounding the 39 Articles solidly in the Reformation
 He makes mention of the erosion of the need for subscription to the articles, the various ways they have been "interpreted" in latitudinarian and Anglo-Catholic circles and laments that fewer and fewer Anglican provinces pay any significant attention to what was once a doctrinal statement which held what Packer refers to as essentially creedal status within the church of England.Packer insists that doctrinal statements and creeds are necessary because we live in a divided Christendom - that is - churches need statements which identify where they stand

 Failing to lay out a clear theology, in Packer's view, actually works against ecumenical dialogue and not for it


 Lack of clarity only breeds confusion, not unity

 Anglicanism, as stated by the Articles of Religion, is firmly committed to both the authority of scripture and the three creeds of Christendom

 As such, the articles state a Christianity that is both reformed and historical, and as such the articles express a rich heritage.Where the Anglican communion has drifted is in its commitment to Scripture as the final authority and its commitment to salvation by faith alone
 Roger Beckwith's appendix articulates a few recent clarifications that might supplement the Articles regarding historic and evangelical Anglican belief

 Packer and Beckwith both stand against the view that sacraments operate apart from faith, as one example of a creeping reinterpretation of a central Anglican principle


 One wonders if Packer's stinging critique of recent moves toward a catholic and semi-sacrificial view of the Eucharist raised much attention when the book was written decades ago
 Roger Beckwith's contribution suggests that such a sacrificial understanding of the Eucharist overturns the very foundations of Christianity, a stinging rebuke to many liturgical alterations in recent decades.Anglicanism has become a broad tent with Evangelicals in the minority, liberal revisionists attempting to steer the entire communion toward a humanistic relativism and those sympathetic to more Catholic beliefs pulling the communion in a third direction

 Most Anglicans seem to float between the three views oblivious to the differences between them

 Both of the latter seem to be willing to discard, reinterpret or ignore the 39 Articles of Religion as a doctrinal statement and advance a particular agenda in spite of them
 The result is no consistent or coherent theology that can lay claim to being the official Anglican position on many, many issues


 Packer's case is that the Articles need to be returned to their status as a statement of faith Anglicans should subscribe to
 It makes sense, because the alternative is the dissaray that Anglicanism is currently experiencing.

$REVIEW.: I was quite engrossed in reading this book about Francesco Forgione - Padre Pio's life.  Francesco was a simple man who came from a poor farming village in Italy and was educated by clergy.  Growing up he was a loner who spent many hours in prayer and was offended when someone used profanity.  Francesco's studies and piety eventually lead him to become a Capuchin Friar and priest.I was drawn to the mystical experiences he had which started during his childhood.  The Virgin Mary would frequently visit and speak with him.  He was tormented by the evil one who would visit and beat him almost nightly.  Padre Pio had many spiritual gifts; reading people's hearts, bi-location, clairvoyance, healing power and the ultimate was his receiving the stigmata.The book is written by a journalist who was a friend of Padre Pio and he gives insights into his simple and obedient life.  He had a vision of building a hospital for the poor which he saw come to fruition during his life.Padre Pio was a holy man who, like Jesus, intimidated the religious hierarchy who caused problems for him and restricted his access to the public and his ability to celebrate Mass.  Padre Pio knew that God's will be done and even under severe accusations and restrictions he was obedient and optimistic about the future, a man of hope.

What an opening chapter!Tori has had the most horrific start to life and although tough as nails and worldly, in some ways, she's also incredibly naive and damaged.Shying away from human touch and now caught in a situation where she is forced to relive the bleakest moments of her life so far, she seems to connect with Agent Eli Founder.Eli, having never heard of, or met, Tori before being assigned to her case, sees something in her that others don't. It's more than mere empathy for her though and as she opens up to him, will the lines be blurred?This, the first book in A New Life series, is a torturous start to Tori's tale. Packed with so much information on what came before, it gave me an understanding of who Tori was, but the question remains, who will Tori become? Can she change, grow, reinvent herself? Or will she revert to her upbringing, signalling her demise?This book is beautifully written and clawed it's way into me and I thoroughly enjoyed (if that's the right word for this sort of book?!) but heed the warnings!

$REVIEW.: First the caveat: I'm writing this review as someone who didn't know Erlang at all before reading this book. I am a very experienced programmer in many other languages, but not Erlang.This is a very good book for beginners that covers a great deal of ground and, most importantly for a computer programming book, is eminently readable.I greatly enjoyed the chapter on recursion and he does a fine job of introducing functional programming. Given how strongly functional Erlang can be this was important and he explained the concepts without taking the common route of deciding to start with the lambda calculus (which would have put off many readers).  Erlang has a great deal of weird syntax and the book is large in part because the author explains it all in detail. This is very welcome because some of Erlang's concepts will be unfamiliar to even experienced programmers (for example, Erlang's pattern matching concept is powerful, but odd).The author has to cover a number of difficult topics (functional programming, concurrency, pattern matching) as they are fundamental to the language and he does a good job of them all.I'm wary of books that includes details outside the core language (such as libraries) because they are often filler. That's not the case here; the author goes into detail about network programming and data storage and these sections are useful and relevant.I had only minor reservations about some of the author's analogies. At one point he talks about 'circular dependencies' and uses as a metaphor an incestuous family where a man is his father's own brother (and there's an illustation!).Overall an excellent, rounded book about Erlang. I would recommend this to people starting out with the language, and it would be my choice in learning Erlang.

$REVIEW.: I requested this book from Rebecca Forster, the author, because I loved her novel, Hostile Witness, and she was kind enough to oblige. I give this novel 3.5 stars.Before Her Eyes focuses on two protagonists, Dove, a hard-boiled small town policeman, and Tessa, the beautiful model that has vanished. The setup is interesting--there is a dead man in a convenience store, which is the last place Tessa was seen before she vanished. We see alternating perspectives between Dove in a tight third person, and Tessa in first person. As Dove tries to track down Tessa, he finds himself uncovering mysteries that others hoped to keep hidden.The strengths of this novel include some of the great description and some interesting plot twists. Forster excels at revealing secrets and bringing the unexpected.However, I had some difficulties with this novel. The pacing is a little off-- I found myself uncertain why we were following Tessa at all. The middle drags some as we wander around with Dove trying to figure out what is going on. And although I really enjoyed the twists, particularly at the end, some of them still don't quite make sense to me.That said, I still think Forster is one to watch-- and her Witness series is excellent. This was not my favorite of her books, but still a fun read.

$review_text.: I don't know about other people, but I read a lot of books that I neither love nor hate. I have very little feeling about them at all, actually. This is one of those books. There wasn't anything obviously wrong with it and I didn't find myself loath to finish it, but I can't say it rang any real bells for my either. It was OK. It was so-so. It was average. It was a fine distraction that I probably won't remember tomorrow.I thought it started off strong and tapered to nothing as the plot died about halfway through. Helios and Griffin were very sweet and there were a number of 'awww' moments. I appreciated Helios' take on submission and surrender and the sex was fine (not fabulous, but not too bad either). All in all, a passable read but little more.

$review_text.: These are nicely fleshed out characters who are completely in synch with the original P&P. The many pages of conversations are thoroughly engaging. I enjoyed the interplay with the flower bouquets, which was much more interesting than I expected (not being an avid gardener). Overall, it is a delightful book. The only element that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is the unbelievably high level of angst Darcy and Elizabeth experience regarding each other's feelings despite lots of shared heated gazes, pleasant conversations with blatant hints, and the fact that, regardless of the dropped flower, the bouquets they gather for each other clearly express way more than friendship. But for those readers who love lots of Darcy-and-Elizabeth together and in love, this book is a sure winner. Roughly the last quarter of it focuses on the first days of their marriage. If you object to any explicit sexual content, it may not be your cup of tea, but I found those scenes very sweet and, at times, funny as Darcy tries to hold his ardor in check through the 2-day trip to Pemberley while Elizabeth is comparatively naive and clueless, unintentionally making it more difficult for him. All in all, a very entertaining read!

But not everything is as it seems, and Lorne discovers that she's not just dealing with one serial killer but two. Adding to the complication, Lorne is still dealing with the death of her father and trying to get help for her sister, Jade, who's not coping well.I've enjoyed all the books in this series and they just keep getting better! I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it.If you want a fast-paced thriller with plenty of gritty and gripping action, look no further.

$review_text.: This was a freebie I had heard about on Goodreads and since I like Eliza Gayle and already read a bunch of her stuff I thought what the hey.  I found it really really short, as far as erotica goes it really wasn't all that and for a book about BDSM it was really bland.  There was really only one sex scene and it was ok.  The story portion, yanno the part that is not erotica was ok, Melody trades in her soul to a demon to become this super hot sex bomb but finds out she actually sucks as a succubus.  But lives happily ever after anyway.  Like I said quick read I finished it in an hour.

$review_text.: If you had reached a point of financial desperation, how far would you go to turn things around?Shari Barnes is a college student who has been making ends meet by waitressing. Her live-in boyfriend, Nathan Townsend, has it a tad better working as a stockbroker.Unfortunately, within a very short period of time, both find themselves unemployed. Accused of wrongdoing, Nathan has a tough job search ahead of him. Prospects in L.A. aren't much better for Shari. To make matters worse, Shari inadvertently causes a chain reaction car crash which just happens to involve a very handsome customer from Shari's former job.The fired-up female driver at the head of the crash claims she's hurt. Facing a lawsuit for the lady's injuries, Shari & Nathan meet the defendant's unscrupulous attorney. While there, she runs into Bryce, the handsome customer from the accident scene.Bryce isn't an ordinary citizen & Shari's accident wasn't very accidental. When Bryce offers her a way out of her despair, it isn't a legal way. Will the insurance fraud game prove too much of a gamble? Or will the allure of financial independence be too much of a golden ticket to pass up?Our villain, Bryce, is a pretty realistic portrayal of someone who'd be in an activity such as this. Those committing fraud tend to be slick & dapper- which he is both.Shari is high-strung & emotional. Readers may shake their heads at such naivety in Los Angeles. Nathan, too, should have been much wiser, being a stockbroker & all.Although it's fiction, the book's realism can easily mimic a headline news story. Fraud is big business. It's easy to see how desperate people can fall into the trap. Shari, especially, feels real by being in such a hardworking, but low Totem pole career.Coarse language is present. It doesn't diminish the fantastic plot. Besides, with some of the folks in Bryce's inner circle, you'd be surprised to not hear these things!All the action is fast-paced. It's not clouded with excessive dialogue or unnecessary scenery descriptions. I found myself quite invested in the plot. Actually, I was genuinely concerned with what decision Shari would make & I wanted to see what would become of her.Lindy Hudis did a fabulous job blending fact with fiction. Thorough research is evident. Her characters are strong & she's woven quite a captivating read. I read through it quickly due to its smooth yet fast pace.We're sure to see more fantastic offerings from our author. I rate it a 5 of 5 stars.I received 1 print copy of the book for review. No other compensation was provided. I was not under obligation to write a positive review.

$REVIEW.: Ms Gayle presents herself as a new, self published(perhaps), writer.For a supposed Regency-type read, I personally didn't appreciate the incorporation of the modern ethos of the easy hookup
Better research is also appreciated.Ms Gayle also seemed to be confused as to whether she was writing for a YA or Erotica audience.I was entertained by the story, but I felt there should have more character development

However, events were sufficiently tangled and quick-fire to hold my interest, and I went ahead and bought the anthology 3 book followup and have read them too.I was as drawn in to her other characters and stories as these

But there was no improvement in the use of incorrect,extra,and run-on words
Although Ms Gayle's characters grew in understanding of themselves, there was no improvement in the area of grammar or editing

Give us a break, read your story out loud before you publish it!What could have been at least a 4, was drug down by the need to "edit on the fly"!!!this review will be repeated on the "Influence" novels

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this story of Char and Riley. It's a nice love story that was an easy light read that sometimes you need in all the books we read that are dark and twisted. There is nothing wrong with having a good old fashioned love story to make you believe in love. The book is a duel POV with each chapter being in both Char and Riley POV. The author really does a great job keeping the POV in line and the story flowing back and forth between the two.We start out with Char just coming out of a bad relationship and Riley moving to Boston to start fresh after his parents tragically pass away. They first meet unexpectedly at a news stand and then again after Riley answers a Craig's List add for a roommate this is from Char's best friend and her sister's boyfriend Derrick. It's like fate keeps bringing them together. They have an instant connection but since Char just came out of a bad relationship she is not sure if she is ready to start another.Riley is the good guy we all want to have around. He's got that southern charm that makes all girls swoon and the rugged good looks that go with it. After moving in with Derrick, he starts looking for a job and lands one with a construction company that unknowing to him is Char's fathers company. Again fate brings him and Char together. He is instantly drawn to Char and falls hard and fast for her.Can Char look pass her past relationships and start something new with Riley or does she reject him and keep him as just friends. Can Riley convince her that since fate keeps bringing them together they are meant to be? You will need to get the book to find out.

$review_text.: If you like bible history, archaeology and facts, then you will love Story of the Bible by Larry Stone
I have never come across a book that is packed with much information on the Bible


This book is about "the fascinating history of the Bible: its writing, translation and effect on civilization." It is great as a reference tool because of its large size which includes several illustrations and life-size reproductions from the world's most important Bibles including the first printing of the King James Bible! The reproductions can also be pulled out for better viewing.The book's colorful account makes bible history come alive and will appeal to all readers


The Early Years of the Church, The Middle Ages, and The Bible in English are among the chapters that make up this excellent book

In addition, readers will know why the Dead Sea Scrolls are important, if all translations mean the same thing, and much more

Personally, Larry Stone does a brilliant job by exploring the history of the Bible in ways that has not been explored before
This book was very well written! I highly recommend it to anyone that is interested in bible history, archaeology and facts.I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program

$REVIEW.: A cynic might say this book is part of a long parade of hocus pocus prosperity books. I am not that cynical. After tirades of hate during the recent U S elections, I think it is time for some positive messages and that is what this book is full of. For example, view this:"You are a human BEING. You are not a human HAVING. It is not about having or not having STUFF. What you ARE may influence what you HAVE, but what you HAVE does NOT make you what you are." That is good stuff and but one nugget from a big bowl.

$review_text.: In this second installment in the Spirits series a clairvoyant is seeing the grisly murders of fashion models in Paris. This was a fast paced thriller set in the middle of the fashion capital of the world Paris, France.Jon-Luc Boudreaux (sexy name, oui?) has been clairvoyant all his life. This was not an easy thing for him to live with growing up when he didn&#8217;t understand it. After running away from home at an early age he manage to find a man who understood what he was and helped him. Jon-Luc went on to become an FBI agent who had the best success rate at closing cases due to his gift. But after years of hiding his secret and seeing all the things he had he finally burnt out and quit the FBI. He decides to go to Paris to visit an old friend, Inspector Claude Rousseau. Right off the bat Jon-Luc is thrown into the investigation of fashion models turning up murdered.Angela Henderson (who was in the first book) is now living in Paris working for a famed designer after an incident in New York made it to where no one would hire her in the fashion industry. Angela and Jon-Luc accidentally bump into each other a few times and realize there is an attraction there but don&#8217;t really connect until the latest death brings Jon-Luc to her due to her knowing the latest victim.Where in the last book the entity was unseen in this one Jon-Luc has the misfortune to not only seeing the dead victims, he is also seeing through the eyes of the killer as the murders happen. It&#8217;s a race for Jon-Luc and Claude to try and figure out who the killer is before he targets his next victim and it&#8217;s not long before they realize that Angela is next on the list.From the opening scene to the final I didn&#8217;t want to put this book down. The author did a great job of keeping you on the edge of your seat by giving you a glimpse into the killers mind and freaking you out with the bloody ghostly images of the victims as they came to Jon-Luc. This book wasn&#8217;t as scary as the first but still very chilling. I love how this authors mind thinks.

$review_text.: BDSM fans, if you haven't visited Club Esoteria yet, it is time. JILLIAN'S MASTER, book five in the series, is a short, sweet ride as a Dom and sub find each other in the most common of ways...by accident!It's Jillian's thirtieth birthday and her best friend Blaze isn't going to go along with the idea of a bottle of wine and a good book to celebrate. Blaze is determined to get her friend laid, so it's off to the private club, Esoteria, in search of a good Dom to make this "old" girl feel alive. Jillian is a novice when it comes to the submissive lifestyle, but she is curious and decides to play along.Master G is on the hunt for a submissive. In his forties, he is ready to settle down, but he can't find what he is looking for. And then in walks Jillian. Tall, curvaceous and totally stunning, she captivates him. The two share some passion and then Jillian flees while Gunner sleeps.What was she thinking?Monday morning she has put her temporary loss of sanity behind her and she steps into her father's business ready to convince Gunner McNeill that he should invest in their business and save them from financial ruin. Little did she know that Gunner McNeill is none other than Master G, and if she wants to have a new partner in business, she's going to be having one in bed this week, too.I love how Gunner makes Jillian stretch her comfort zone. The staid daughter is used to wearing a bun and ankle length dresses, but Gunner isn't going to go for that. He takes her shopping and dresses her to stop hearts and start the water cooler gossip humming.She takes all his commands like a trooper and underneath all the fretting, she is loving every minute of it. Gunner isn't a sadist. He doesn't play with floggers and they don't go for public play in the club. Humiliation isn't really his thing either. The man likes toys, spanking and LOTS of sex. This one is a pretty good choice for those who are new to BDSM books or BDSM Fetish Club centered books where the play can get pretty emotionally and physically intense. Not here. This shows the loving and sensual side of the BDSM spectrum.If you just have a little time for a short hot read, this is a great one to check out. The story isn't complex, but it hit all the key elements and left a smile on my face. Cooper McKenzie is one of my favorite erotic authors. Her style is so smooth that I find myself slipping right in and becoming oblivious to all the distractions around me.An innocent, sexy, fun treat. BDSM fans make sure to check this one out. ...and ENJOY!

("No Peace for the Damned," p. 89)Megan Powell's "No Peace for the Damned" is a mixed bag of flesh-rending horror, bodice-ripping romance, cringe-inducing Scooby Team dynamics, a not-too-turrible paranormal coming-of-age story, and plenty of first-novel amateurishness. Note that the romance goes little beyond expressions of desire; with a small amount of editing, this could be and possibly should have been a young adult novel. While marred by cardboard characterization, embarrassing language, and a big dose of illogic, the novel is saved (at least to the 3-star = "OK" level) by good storytelling and a complex and sympathetic protagonist."No Peace for the Damned" tells the tale of Magnolia Kelch, a young woman with considerable paranormal power and a long history of gruesome familial abuse. Since birth, young Magnolia has been tortured, mutilated, and occasionally killed (temporarily) by her evil father, her two evil uncles, and her two evil brothers. The Dark Side of the Force runs strong in the Kelch family; all have some degree of telepathic, telekinetic, and other paranormal abilities. When, one day, she is decapitated, buried, and left for dead, Magnolia manages to pull herself together (literally), and escape her family estate. She immediately runs into Thirteen, one of the leaders of the Network, an organization dedicated to defeating paranormal baddies like her kin.Over the course of the novel, Magnolia confronts the distrust Network members feel towards her, wrestles with the magical romantic attraction she shares with Network member Theo Mahle (translation: "The Male with Smoldering Eyes and Well-Defined Chest Muscles"), and struggles to overcome the evil and corruption she finds within herself. When members of the Network begin disappearing, Magnolia feels compelled to help, leading inexorably to a confrontation with members of the family she hates, fears ... and can't help but feel connected to.Powell withholds quite a bit of information from readers, presumably so that she can deploy it strategically in a long line of sequels. Is the Network fighting a vast paranormal conspiracy, or is the Kelch family the only real threat? How widespread are paranormal powers, and where do they come from? Do they derive from interbreeding with demons or monsters ... or extraterrestrials? (Note that there are no explicit supernatural elements in the novel -- no ghosts or demons or angels.) How has the Network survived, given that its members are so ordinary, quarrelsome, and incompetent? How old are the characters? (This is a pretty basic question; there's nothing in the book to rule out Magnolia being 16 and Theo being twice her age.) Is there any sort of link between Magnolia's evil family and Theo's evil family?Bottom line: "No Peace for the Damned" straddles the line between paranormal romance ("I wasn't sure if I was more impressed by his gentleness or his fierceness. Either way, I was totally getting hot." p. 124) and urban fantasy (which is how it's billed, despite the absence of anything identifiably urban). Its uniqueness lies in the absence of demons, angels, vampires, werewolves, and other stock supernatural characters. Powell's skills need quite a bit of polishing, but she is talented enough to tell a compelling story. In other words: passable airport/beach book targeted at women.

Well you do go on and end up meeting his brother who has lost his wife and comes to town with his two children without realizing that his brother has died until Caroline tells Jack! There is some sort of immediate attraction between them and Caroline really loves his two children and eventually they realize they are falling in love and end up together!I loved this story and would have given it 5 stars except it seemed too predictable to me!

The possibilities could be endless if this were the case.There are so many planets our there floating around other suns. Wouldn't it be nice if you wanted to pick one for your home and then have a "developer" go out and turn it into a place you could visit and live?And what if you could take this same concept of technology and make Earth a more healthy planet, with less concern for global warming and such? I suppose if you knew how to "make" a planet, then you could fix one too!Interesting ideas...

$review_text.: For full review including excerpt and dialogue highlight, please visit Reader's Edyn at:readersedyn (dot) blogspot (dot) comReview:This is my first book by Sidney Bristol


I decided to read UNDER HIS SKIN for a couple of reasons; first and foremost being that I have read some very good books from Ellora's Cave lately


When I had the chance to feature this book on the blog, I jumped on the chance
I also wanted to read this book because it explored some unfamiliar territory for me

I don't know a lot about tattoos having none myself, but I was intrigued by the idea of having a series/book centered within the tattoo world

I also liked that both of these characters had a lot of crap to rise up from before they found each other

Those factors considered, I decided to read and review this book.Pandora has had a less than desirable past at best


She was deserted by her father at a young age and raised by her mother for several years until cancer claimed her life
She ends up the unwanted child of her father and never quite fits in with him or his new wife and new life


She bails at 18 and ends up eventually hooking up with her emotionally unbalanced and abusive ex, Robert

She tries to make a break from Robert only to be forced back into the relationship until one fateful night when she is rescued by her new "family"

She finds peace within her So Inked family and settles into a better life than she had before.Brian has been there, done that
As a former rock star, there is not much he hasn't been exposed to at one time or another
Life was good on the road to success until a plane crash takes the lives of the band members; all except Brian
Trying to cope from survivor's guilt and some ass-kicking physical therapy, Brian decides to pay homage to his former band members by permanently inking them on his body
He finds Pandora after searching through several artists that can do the job.Pandora instantly recognizes Brian when he comes to her for his tattoo and is mortified, but tries to play it cool and behave professionally
Several questions later, Brian has figured out who Pandora is
Ironically, as big as the crush was that Pandora had on Brian, he too did not go unaffected by the young girl from a few years back


Little does she know just how much of an impression she made on him


But a bad situation and feelings of guilt may make it impossible for them to move past the artist/client relationship
Several issues arise that interfere with a possible future for the two

Highest on the list being Pandora's belief that Brian can do so much better than her


Of course Brian has baggage from the crash, and Pandora also has a crazy asshat of an ex who is lurking in the shadows.What I liked most about this book was that each chapter began with a definition of tattoo terms such as stencil and flash
I mean I didn't have a clue what any of this lingo meant, but the descriptions allowed me to continue reading without interference from my lack of knowledge in this area


It was beyond apparent that Ms

Bristol knows her tattoos, the processes, and just about everything else someone would need to know

I appreciated that she included so much information about tattooing without presenting it in a confusing way


I came away feeling somewhat educated


I also enjoyed that Pandora and Brian remained consistent in character throughout the story
I felt like they knew who they were, they knew their faults, and they made no bones about it except to try and make a go of a difficult situation.Unfortunately, I had a few things that I didn't like
There were a few sections of the book that mimicked things that had been stated prior

For example, two or three times we read about how jealous Pandora is that someone else had tattooed Brian before she did

I felt like I was re-reading parts that had already been covered


I also disliked that the whole story ended so abruptly
I was reading and then it was over


I had no clue that the story was about to cut out on me


I feel like there was so much left unfinished

Robert, Carly, Ike's mother ~ just to name a few things that I felt left me hanging
The only thing I can think of is that the following books may cover some of these topics because this is the first in series

But that may be a bit of an unfortunate circumstance if that is the way things are handled because the couple featured in the next book would lose some of their time
I am not saying what will or will not happen in the next book because I have absolutely no clue
I just don't like finishing a book and being left with a million questions


I also really disliked Robert

As a psycho, he works

But I felt like he could have been mentioned as part of Pandora's past and reason for many of her insecurities without actually being a part of her current life
His actions toward the end of the book were unexpected and I felt like Carly was thrown under the bus as a secondary character


I just didn't like how things played out.This book is not going to make it as a favorite read for me


And although I really enjoyed the educational aspects of tattooing that was added to the book, it wasn't enough for me to be able to really like the book and overlook the flaws that interfered with my enjoyment

The story is a good attempt and can likely be enjoyable for many people as a quick read to pass the time

Of that I have no doubt

And in fact I have seen several positive comments about this story


But for readers like me who hate to be left with questions at the end and who want to see more of an HEA (especially when reading a novella), you might want to think twice about this particular story.(eBook copy provided by author/tour company in exchange for an honest review.)

$REVIEW.: Lee Kravitz a self-described workaholic magazine editor, suddenly finds himself without a job in his mid-fifties and instead of jumping back on the treadmill picking up elsewhere, he decides to do some evaluating of his chosen path and choices in life


 Especially he notes that he has some "Unfinished Business" that is worth examining


 This is where this book begins.As anyone can imagine, when you get to your mid-fifties, there are things that you mull about and think, you could have done better
 It's stuff you either you left undone, shouldn't have done or wanted to do

 Or there could be family relationships that could be better or friends you really wanted to catch back up with
 The author decides he needs to sort out this unfinished business before he moves on and gives himself a year to do so.As he looks up old friends and family, pays off old debts, attends to obligations left undone and thanks the people he should have years ago, he realizes how rewarding attending to these loose ends becomes

 He finds new connections from old, a new way to look at things including a new joy in life in the process.While reading this; I felt the author crafted a very personal but accessible story


 He examined his life before work and the man he used to be

Strange how we all look back at ourselves as if we are separate from the people we now are

 I felt he was honest and critical with himself and you can see how in a busy life; items like this get left behind.I like the fact that he put each issue in it's own chapter, despite the fact, that I'm sure all the various issues might well have been overlapping
It made it pleasant to read and you got a sense of completion
 What I found heartening, was even though he had expectations of what he would find in each case, he realized quickly how wrong he was, but in a very pleasant way


 I think what most of us find when we look back, our viewpoint has changed and we see things differently


 Two points the author discusses was his experiences with a bully and one where he looked up a former mentor
 Even though both effected him very personally, in retrospect, in the case of the bully, the bully's actions towards him actions were never personal, he was just collateral damage and in the case of the mentor, he never saw the insecure young man, but a wealth of potential
 If only we could learn to step back and examine things less personally when we are in the midst of our lives.CHAPTERS WITHIN WERE (Based on an Advanced Copy):PREFACE: Compiling the List: Finding Ten things that Truly MatterCHAPTER 1: Finding Sorrow's daughter: Finding a Long-Lost RelativeCHAPTER 2: I'm so Sorry for Your Loss: Making a Condolence CallCHAPTER 3: The Check is in the Mail: Paying a Long-Overdue DebtCHAPTER 4: I've been Thinking of You Since the Planes Struck: Reaching Out to a Distant FriendCHAPTER 5: Forgive Me the Harm I Wished on You: Letting go of a GrudgeCHAPTER 6: Thank You Mr

Jarvis: Seeking Spiritual Guidance From a MentorCHAPTER 7: On the Road to Mt


Athos: The Road not TakenCHAPTER 8: The Day Eliot Ness Set My Grandfather Straight or Did He?: Healing a Family WoundsCHAPTER 9: I remember Nana: Eulogizing a Loved OneCHAPTER 10: The Circle Grows Wider: Keeping a PromiseCHAPTER 11: Moving Ahead: The Journey of a LifetimeNot everything was tidied up neat with bows, but that's life

 I'm sure Lee's journey ahead will be even more examined and his unfinished business a shorter list

 However as a reader this compels me to imagine my own list
 What about you?

$REVIEW.: The Breaking Point is a story about a woman's struggle with an abusive husband, another woman's struggle with that same man, and that man's struggle with his inability to control his impulses.  And what happens when it all goes wrong.This was a great fast-paced story.  It was action packed and kept my interest from the beginning.  I was very frustrated by Mandy's inability to leave her abusive husband John, especially because she volunteered at a women's shelter.  John was a man who thought he could get away with anything with no consequences to his actions.  This book was very well written and easy to read.  It was just the right length for a night of reading.  I was disappointed with the ending.  ***Spoiler Alert***  I really love my HEA's.  This book had a major cliffhanger.  I will definitely be looking for the next book.  I need to see how the story ends.

Jolan's books are really great reads, and this one is no exception


She provides enough background and research for the reader to know what they are getting into, but not so much that it becomes a turn off

Mellifica's Wait for Me totally sucked me in as did Mellifica.Oh the little jerk returns (spoiler free here!!!) and he's... well, you just want to strangle him. And Melissa Quinn, bless her heart for the merry hell he tries to put her through. I loved her strength, how she didn't let little Mr. Jerk toy with her. And that retched woman. Ug! I'd like to take her by her black hair and swing her round and round and then let go! That nasty, nasty cougar wench. She's just... GROSS! You'll see.Now don't get me wrong, Melissa has a few piss-me-off moments too. Why the hell did she do this, or that... and I wanted to shake her and ask "why in the name of all sanity would you do that? Why oh why?!" But then part of me understood.There's some new character's introduced, one in particular that I really liked. She's the perfect friend for Melissa. Soooo. Without adding any spoilers, I can totally say this was fantastic! LOVED every single page!And say what? I think a little snitch told me there may be a third book? Oh snitchy I hope you're right!By far one of the best YA/NA angst ridden, heart stealing, gut wrenching, and emotionally satisfying series out there.

$review_text.: This was a story of sorts.Historic, it had a histrionic element to it in the mother of the protagonist.Very revolutionary in that a lady would shirk the title to go for a coffee house
Or be accepted by the high society.Of course the circumstances around which the story was woven was convincing, but I thought not enough.Revolutionary stories can either have a bang, and go all out, or have a very steady theme and depth.I liked the sweetness of the pastries!For a historic book, and a lady who has very strong principles, I didn't quite fathom how she decided to go the extra mile with Richard without tying the knot


The steamy scenes should have either been more steamy or more subdued


Same with Anna - she should have either exhibited higher strength of character, or shown her aggressive side more, to account for her lapses in judgement.In all, definitely worth a read once, but I couldn't go beyond 3 stars.

$review_text.: I served in the United States navy for twenty years, though not aboard submarines.  I could see the navy I knew, both good and bad, on many pages of the book.The Right Thing explores the life of Cdr. Scott Waddle, Captain of the nuclear submarine Greenville, on the day it collided with and sank the Ehime Maru, a floating Japanese high school.  The first portion of the book tells about Scott Waddle, from his childhood up through his naval career.  The last half is the story of the collision, sinking, the investigation and trial.I read the book over a weekend and found it well written.  Even though I knew the outcome, I was pulled into Cdr. Waddle's story.  The author does more than retell the tragic events, we learn about the man and his family as they stand with him.  This story is ultimately more than a tragedy; it is a story of faith and perseverance through adversity.  It is hard to read of the death of young people and the legal proceedings against those who are, in many ways, like us.  Countless people have come close to tragedy through momentary carelessness or inattention.  The expression, "there, but by the grace of God, go I," comes to mind.At the end of the book, Cdr. Waddle relates how he went to Japan at his own expense, visited with the families and apologized to them.  He did not have to do that but it was the right thing to do.  By that act, he took responsibility for his deeds and those who served with him.  I recommend his story.Kyle Pratt

$review_text.: Knitters had an earlier book on socks which had some fabulous socks so I've been waiting for this one ever since I saw the spread on the winners. I personally will never knit anything but just enjoy browsing through the book for inspiration. However, even for me, some of the simpler ones look very tempting. Each pattern is written out and also charted and there are plenty of helpful tips where needed. Book is big but lies flat and is in the same format as the magazine. Certainly recommended.

$REVIEW.: A book versed on how to manipulate light for maximum appeal in portrait photography

 How the author explains this is also what makes this a stand out book
 After a scientific description of light, how to meter it and tools used to generate it, some of the basics are covered such as lighting ratios and high and low key lighting
 It is the techniques given on lighting requirements for various shapes of faces that is a real strength of this book

 This along with corrective measures for some common issues will help any photographer ensure the most flattering results possible.

$REVIEW.: I&#8217;ve always identified with Jane Eyre, the downtrodden heroine who&#8217;s constantly reminded how plain she is&#8230;.yet manages to triumph over poverty, hardships and despair. The triumph part I&#8217;m not so good at, but I do tend to wallow in misery, like any good reader of English Literature or supporter of BBC or PBS. Thus I love any adaptation of Bronte&#8217;s writing and when I read that one of my favorite new discoveries &#8211; the writer L.K. Rigel &#8211; was doing an dated version of Jane Eyre entitled &#8220;My Mr. Rochester&#8221;, I was thrilled. Yet a part of me was wondering if she , or anyone could actually do it. She did, and it is magnificent. The book begins in 2081, and Jane is 13 years old. Though it set in the future, through plot twists, turns, and settings, it feels like the 1800s even though there are such things as the internet (in some places). Rigel&#8217;s writing style perfectly fits into the Edwardian mode though it flows as easily as the  conversation  you had with your best friend just this morning. This is the first part  in a five part series. I am waiting for the second part as anxiously as I am waiting for the fourth season of Downton Abbey.  It is just that good.
$SUMMARY.: Loved it!  Stunning adaptation!

I thought there was no way for  Crown of Midnight to be better than Throne of Glass but it was!!!This series is such an exciting, on the edge of your seat, atypical book!! Normally I am pretty good at anticipating what will happen next, but not this time!!! I love everything about this ACCEPT waiting for the third book!!!This book picks up pretty much where throne of glass left off. Celeana is the kings champion, and is hard at work doing his dirty work. Meanwhile the mysterious evil that continues to surround the king does so, while answering some questions from the first book, but raising more!! Our favorite Dorian, Chaol, and Nehemia are all present!! There are new evils to battle, new relationships formed and broken, many questions answered but many more raised!!If you are looking for a series with a little love triangle, a lot of suspense, a lot of action, a book that will keep you guessing at every turn then this should be your next read!

$review_text.: Let's get the negatives out of way first (and there aren't many of them, to my eyes): (1) One particular passage (Thomas and Sadie making that last push to get to Mama), which was, as you can guess, a bit tense, spent a great deal of time describing the landscape around Thomas and Sadie. Now, there's nothing wrong with some good description, but the pace of the story leading up to that point was such that I skipped all the description. (2) Thomas's "internal complaints" got old after a while--yes, yes, no one but you and your mother ever contributed to the family's livelihood, we got that.Now, the positives. First, this was a unique take on some rather overused plot devices, done without overexplaining "how things are." Second, the writing is solid and generally free from those "glitches" that can throw a reader out of the story.And I agree with other reviewers--the title is brilliant.

$review_text.: As soon as the author began referring to the ego, I knew I was likely to take issue with the book. The whole Ego, Superego, Id is a Freudian construct - not something that I personally subscribe to, and not part of the analytical framework I feel is appropriate for a book on spirituality. Once I realized the author was using various psych theories as a baseline to take readers on the path of spiritual discernment I was very disappointed.I am fascinated by all things psych. Spirituality, myth, and cultural beliefs are a long time area of  interest, study, & hobby for me. Because I'm fascinated by these things I do not have a negative view against them, however I do not believe that the framework of psychology is the appropriate one for analyzing or discerning what is right/wrong/challenging for any spiritual path. In fact, many would say that it is a spiritual path of it's own, as many would consider spiritual paths the equivalent of philosophies, and the different schools of psychological thought considered different philosophies as well.So how can one objectively review various spiritual paths/philosophies and offer advice or recommendation when they are viewing these paths from inside their own specific philosophy and using their philosophy for the framework of the analysis? Not very objective or readily applicable to all readers in my opinion ...In the intro the author states "Together, we will explore how to meet the inevitable roadblocks we will encounter on the spiritual path, so that we may live bold, intelligent, radiant lives of spiritual transformation. We will learn how investigating and evaluating different practices, paths,and teachers can help us make intelligent spiritual choices. And we will learn to distinguish between truth and falsity, between passion that binds us and passion that frees us."My problem with this statement is that her overall viewpoint and perceptions are distinctly colored by the lens of her psychology background. She also states in the introduction that the Italian psychiatrist Roberto Assagioli, founder of psychosynthesis, indicates that psychotherapy can not only treat psychopathology, but foster spiritual awakening as well. It is my opinion that taking spirituality and fitting it into the constructs of a psychological framework does not lead to discernment and is certainly not objective.One might say that anyone who studies various paths will be doing so with a biased view based on their background. However, if that person is truly open minded and not trying to fit the study into the framework of another philosophy I believe it will be more accurate and applicable to people as a whole.Many who are on a spiritual path are also those who subscribe to holistic living and natural health. Many on that path have discovered that living closer to nature, eating a whole foods, nutritionally dense, & vitamin/mineral complete diet can do wonders for an individual's psyche. For many this can even 'cure' psychological disorders. There is much documentation demonstrating that particular dietary changes can have amazing effects for those who are labeled schizophrenic or autism spectrum. This isn't a spiritual fix,or a psychotherapy fix but a biochemical fix - balancing the biochemistry of the body. This often has a positive effect on many physical and mental diagnoses. So if such psych issues can be fixed with basic nutrition, where does it put the limited viewpoint that psychotherapy is the fix? And if the psychotherapy is so limited there, how does that transfer to the use of psychotherapy based analysis of spirituality?So if her whole viewpoint is based in psychotherapy/psychological principles and those principles state that mental disorders can be cured by extended psychotherapy, which will also lead to enlightenment, then obviously this viewpoint is quite limiting and is not truly the path of discernment as advertised. If nutrition can fix psychological diagnoses then obviously psychological theory is not the be-all, end-all and likely is not the best framework for analyzing any spiritual path.Readers who are fans of psychotherapy and the various psychological theories, archetypes, etc. may very well resonate with the author and her viewpoints. However for me this didn't happen at all.The heavy psych philosophy influence can be seen with a quick view of the Chapter titles:1. What is Spirituality anyway?2. Spiritually transmitted disease3. The posture of the mind4. The psychology of Ego5. Spiritual materialism and spiritual bypassing6. The healing crisis7. The tantric principle8. Pandora's secrets: demystifying the shadow9. The body as Bodhi tree: the imperative of embodiment10. The union of psychology and spirituality11. The question of the teacher12. Om Mani Padme Grow up!

I enjoyed this book because it is suspenseful throughout each page, even when you think you are starting to fully understand the theme it quickly builds up onto something else which prevents it from getting boring, I think that's why I enjoyed this book so much.

$review_text.: Using an intriguing style that utilizes both pulp fiction and literary non-fiction styles, Hedges and Sacco have developed a disturbing, yet honest, view of the 'voiceless masses of America'. Being not only previously defeated in former protests but totally unorganized, without political representation and lacking in funding, the four segments of society that were chosen should only be looked upon as being one of the many, one of the nameless victims to unfettered capitalism. The way out of this morass, to be honest, seems to be a near impossibility. While the authors spend a great deal of time at the text's end heralding the Occupy Movement, the result of such an spontaneous process seems, at best, very limited. Why? There are two reasons. First of all the moneyed 1% not only control the economics of the country but its political system as well. And, by doing so, the crowds were broken up through the simple use of police brutality. Across the country this was done not only in an coordinated manner but done under the guises of ignoring one of our sacred Constitutional rights, that of legal protest. The other reason for Occupy's apparent failure lies with the protestors themselves. When the group occupying Zuccotti Square first became newsworthy we immediately related it to the 1960s protests and, in turn, became very hopeful. But this era had one thing that this time is lacking; "skin in the game". It was members of that generation because they had dark skin that were being lynched, beaten and treated inhumanely. It was their personal pain that led to the initiation of those protests. Also, it was members of this generation that held 1A Draft Cards which were a near guarantee of being sent to the killing fields of Southeast Asia. It was them that first chanted "Hell no, we won't go." It was them who protested or fled to Canada such that they could hold onto their chances of mere survival. Lastly, it was the women of our society who led the march against having others be in charge of their bodies and placing glass ceilings above their heads. Such is not the case with the present situation. The occupiers, while of honest spirit and focus, have very little personal involvement with what is happening. They have `little skin in the game'. So when the eventual swarms of billeted police attacked their rightful positions, they fled. Oh, yes, they may have returned, even more than once, but eventually the blind force of corporatism won out and the public parks remain empty to this date. Our actions since this time against the evils that the book portrays have done little good as well. While we feel somewhat comforted in signing a computer-driven protest sheet or send on a shocking news item through Facebook, this may actually be the devil in disguise for we may begin to feel that our obligation to the aide of this situation is done. After all, we signed a petition, didn't we? Such attitudes, unfortunately, keep us prone in our chairs rather than actively out on the streets as we should be.Chris Hedges, in the text's final paragraphs, holds onto the hope that the Operation Movement gives.  Is he naively stupid or is it myself who is inane through the lack of hope?  Only time will tell and only time can show the way upward or downward. When the raft of life is sinking is it better to hold onto to something, anything in hopes that it will continue to allow you to breath or is it better to view reality for what it is and to completely let go?  Chris says to hold on and I, at this point, choose not to argue with him.  As the my summary title states; "We have met the enemy and he is us.". This, too, defines the plight of the USA as it appears before us. Is there an answer to the cruel prison which we have entrapped ourselves in? There must be or life, as we have come to know of it, has ceased to exist. We just aren't aware of it yet......

$REVIEW.: It&#8217;s a really good story about what happens to people in a dying economy and how they manage to cope with it. It definitely keeps your interest and is quite the unexpected page turner. It would rank up there with the best murder mysteries from real life. And even though there really is no body, the mystery was the fact the town was dying, no one was staying and none knew how to fix the problem. So if you want a little insight on small town Americana and how people were trying to manage in a rotten economy, check out this book. It is really good, and it&#8217;s told by Earl and the cast of characters he meets, wherever he is or if he is just traipsing down memory lane.

The novel starts off somber, as Sam grieves the death of her mother from book 1. Half way through the book, I forgot that her mother was even dead. You feel entwined in Slade and Samantha's relationship, to the point where you feel like you are living it.Naturally, there are a few unrealistic happenings, but overall, their's seem like a true, stead fast, realistic relationship. Their fights are real. Their problems, while sometimes feeling a tad over dramatized, are that of every day re;relationships. I love though that it's not all rainbows and sunshine. Especially where Samantha and her friends are concerned.I love the complexity to the story. You would think that everything would be rushed, and everyone happily paired, but that's not the case. The story even comes with it's own brand of mysteries. The last secret revealed in this novel is one I bounced around for a while. Still, I like that I wasn't sure. Even being a romance novel, it has it's other layers, depths and unrelated issues that drive this story down it's own path, away from the usual cliche of a romance novel.The sex scenes have their moments, like everything else in this book. Once again, Sam and Slade work through things like a real couple, and we get to see them grow and come into their relationship.Samantha has always been an interesting character to me. I love her small fierceness and her girly attitude. She is the epitome of girly girl and I love it. I never doubt a characters personality, they have all been clear from the beginning. I also love the sentimental values and time spent to detail important moments of this story. When necessary, we even took a stroll down memory land with Samantha and Slade.This novel allows up to develop with Sam and Slade as a couple, as oppose to individuals first. I have no problem with this strategy. I can't see them as anything other than Sam and Slade. This time though, we got to know more about Slade, his family, friends and work. We have always focused more on Samantha and her past, but this time we get to see Slade in the past and to even see the loyalty within his friendship with Josh.The introduction of Tate is a tentative one. He brings an air of violence that I am not use to from this novel. The thing is, the man has yet to even have a sensible confrontation or fight in front of us. I am not certain of his character and where he will go, but I am glad for some clarity at the end of this novel. It brings back the focus to Sam and Slade, as they traverse their relationship and the changes. I do know however, that his character is not one this circle is used to, and I can't wait to get a peak at his book.This story takes place over a period of approximately five months, but it will feel like 2 years tops! There is layers upon layers of events and enough content to spark your interest chapter to chapter. You keep on guessing until  the very end.We can always count on Samantha and Slade to not have the mid novel dramatic break ups and they never disappoint. This is one feature of this story that makes me come back for more.You get all you loved from 'Undescribable' with even more memories to take you to 'Uncontrollable'. The possibilities that await are endless, and I can't wait to see how Sam and Slade's story will conclude. There might not be major fireworks, but there will be a lighting show for sure.
$SUMMARY.: Layers galore. It's not just a romance novel

$review_text.: Highly enjoyable story (if you're into dark themes like this one) and keeps you're mind spinning with the possible outcomes of certain scenes, but that last damn page (as mentioned in another review) really killed it for me! I was so happy because the ending was coming out to be so sweet and perfect after everything that happened but them WHAM! I did not see that coming. And I hated it because the story isn't finished. Well, it better not be the end for their story because it felt like a huge cliffhanger for me. I am glad there's another book for Jasper though, so Im guessing we'll get some answers there or this really is how things will end.I know I'm making no sense and pardon me for that but that ending just... left me incomplete :( But putting that behind, this is a good story with intense and dark moments that make you want to cry and hit something! As much as the ending left me stuck, I will be purchasing the next one in this series!:)

$review_text.: Reading the book knowing it's a part of a series I've never read, it was a pleasant surprise when my interest was captured right on.The heroine, though not much detailed known, is captivating enough for the scenes she is in.The hero has a little depth, probably because he is more active in pushing the action, and very likeable.The chemistry between them is believable enough, but prepare yourself to hit space when love scenes just disappear with a period. I found myself just saying 'Huh' and scrolling back only to realize that either it was very big typo error or the author made it that way. (Alright, for adults it's like you're left hanging.) Luckily the story is light that the abrupt cut did not drove me bunkers.The world is new enough for me to be interesting. The plot, engaging and is made for the length of the story.For a free book, it's worth reading and intrigue me enough to search the author and her other books.

$REVIEW.: From the chance meeting between two people, this book had me hooked until the final page. A delightful and cleverly woven tale of normal people sucked into the dramatic sequence of events that ripples out from such an innocent first meeting. We are treated to a realistic and fascinating insight into the modern lives of native americans. The drama and tension builds nicely to an unexpected (to me) conclusion, and a satisfying ending. This a great first novel. Keep an eye on this author - I expect great things are to follow.

$review_text.: Unbridled Hope by Loree Lough is the third book in the Lone Star Legends series and is a fantastic book


We follow another Neville man and his life on the ranch and finding someone to share his life.I really like this book because Micah really loves the Lord

Callie is sweet also as she gives her whole life to help others
Especially her deaf brother and the baby Micah brings back to town
One of my favorite characters is Gus Applegate

He is an older man who was a Ranger turned to a Pinkerton agent

He was such a gentle, loving man, but some saw him as a rough, tough man


Even though Gus was a lesser character, he was tops in my book
I know you will want to read this book to find out why Micah left town and came back with a baby, Also why Callie doesn't believe she deserves anyone to love.What makes a great book? I think it is a little tragedy, sadness, forgiveness, peace, joy and love; this book has all of that and more
Unbridled Hope has a lot of adventure and fun mixed in with the tragedy and loss.Loree is such a talented lady and has a fantatic sense of humor and it comes through in every one of her books


Even through this book is the third in the series it also makes a great stand alone book.If you like a light hearted read with romance and adventure, this book needs to be on your to read list

I highly recommend Unbridled Hope by Loree Lough.Thank you to Whitaker House for providing this book for review

$REVIEW.: This novel is about a man who wakes up every morning, doing the work that needs to be done,  but not really living his life.  This man is Devin Trent, former rodeo star,  now running his ranch with the weight of guilt and loss on his shoulders.  His wife Olivia  passed away three years ago from breast cancer.  She was a stained glass artist, and her work remains in her studio in his home.  He has not entered her studio  nor looked at her work since the day she died.Claire Best is living in Morning Lake working at a gallery, and is a photographer. She moved here to take care of her grandmother, who has since passed away. She left Claire her sprawling old house, which Claire loves, but can't afford to keep up.  She now lives in rooms built above the garage, and rents the house to summer boarders.Claire and Devin's first meeting is not a pleasant one. He escorts Shirley, Olivia's mother, to the gallery to discuss showing some of Olivia's work, which he has no intention of allowing to happen. It doesn't matter that the showing is to benefit Cancer Research.  Devin is immediately confronted by a stunning portrait of Olivia in the window of the gallery.  He is livid.  Claire had taken the photo of Olivia on a visit to her studio not long after Olivia's diagnosis .  Devin wants it  removed, now.The attraction is immediate, but Claire and Devin have secrets they do not want to share.Claire is also dealing with the teenage son of her boarders, left alone, and looking for trouble.  Devin witnesses some of this boy's destruction, and steps in.  It's not so much  about Olivia's work anymore, it's about Devin and Claire's emotions, and their reluctance to let go of their fears and insecurities.I enjoyed this novel, finished it in one sitting.  I recommend this novel for readers looking for wonderful characters,  cowboys, a sweet love story, and people who believe in second  chances.I received this novel  for an honest review.

 First her mother dies in a car accident, and than her half brother is murdered


 The crime goes unsolved and Julie thinks it's due to the fact that her brother was half Lakota

 Still reeling from her lose, Julie takes a job in the Bear Butte County Sheriff's department hoping that maybe, just maybe she will get a little peace
 She couldn't be more wrong when a new murder turns up and it turns out the young victim is a sixteen year old white girl


 Now everyone is interested in solving the murder


 At the same time she finds out that her best friend and local PI Kevin has been on the case investigating the last two weeks of Samantha's life

 He asks for Julie's help and she reluctantly gives it since this case hits just a little too close to home


 Still before she knows it she and Kevin are getting closer and closer to a killer, and the killer is starting to get nervous

 People connected to Samantha are starting to turn up dead
 Is Kevin or Julie the next to fall victim to a murder that will stop at nothing to protect his secret?I was blown away by this mystery
 I started and finished this book in one sitting
 The murder mystery kept me guessing until the very end and the characters were wonderfully developed
 I loved Julie and Kevin not only was their relationship fun, but it was different

 I loved their dynamics


I would love to see Ms

Armstrong expand on their relationship in another story
 They are a great investigating duo!  Ms

Armstrong took great care and effort in creating her world so the reader will feel truly drawn into what's happening
 Julie is a very complex character and she made me laugh, and cry

 Or should I say I laughed and cried with her

 I highly, highly recommend Ms

Armstrong's debut read
 She provides plenty of edge of your seat reading.

$REVIEW.: Let me say, Brooklyn is my second favorite place on earth (after New Orleans).  I have deep personal and family roots there and have collected many historical books on NY's greatest borough.This book is a wonderful concept.  And it offers some truly fantastic photos with great resolution, good printing, etc.Yet, for all its virtues, this book was somewhat disappointing.  Very frequently (almost every shot) the camera is not set to the same exact spot or angle as the original to which it is contrasted.  When you look at the photos on facing pages you are often comparing apples to oranges.  One old photo of a streetscape shows all three lanes of traffic, while its modern update shows half of a single lane; another photo of the skyscape has barely any sky above the buildings, while the modern update is almost half sky; often whole buildings are cut off the edge of one of the photos, or the second one is taken from a very different angle.  SInce the original photos are the given, it would seem to have taken very minimal care to match the same vantage points on the new photos.  It just comes off as quickly prepared and lazy, and mars the purpose of the project.But overall, this is worth having and enjoying.  A fun exercise is to travel to the spots in the photographs, book in hand, and look yourself.

Travel from state-to-state is limited

I like that she set her story in the near future, not a hundred years from now which makes the events more plausible.There was a nice blend of mystery and intrigue with Christian principles sprinkled in, such as forgiveness.I think she sounds an alarm that needs to be sounded

For me, the message of her book is, &#34;Wake up, America, before it's too late.&#34;

$review_text.: 5/5 HEARTS AT heatherheartsbooks.comWhen After Math, the first book in Denise Grover Swank's New Adult series, Off the Subject, ended, I was skeptical about the book focusing on another character in the fictional confines of Southern University. I'd grown so attached to Tucker and Scarlett and didn't want to see them fade into the background.But once again, Swank's beautiful writing and well-crafted story line lured me in. Redesigned exceeded all my expectations.Within the first two minutes of reading Redesigned, I was absolutely obsessed. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. For two days, it was my purse book. I refused to leave home without it. Whenever I had a few free moments, I was diving in. When it came to the end, I was left wanting more.Off the Subject's second volume takes place not long after After Math ends. This time around, Caroline Hunter, Scarlett's best friend, is the starlet. Caroline sparkles and shines and is a character so easy to relate to.Not unlike her best friend, Caroline has pieces of her past that she hides and would rather forget. In fact, the pieces are so big, its nearly her entire history. She is extremely protective of her future and is determined not to live the life that she once did, back when she was Carol Ann Hunter, living in a beat up old mobile home in Shelbeyville, where she felt unsupported by her parents, who were content to live that lifestyle for the remainder of their days and who made Caroline choose between them and college.But Caroline Hunter drove away from Shelbeyville to Southern University anyway, determined to create a better life for herself, quite literally sewing it together piece by piece as she decided to major in fashion and pursue her dreams.With senior year moving at the speed of light, Caroline can see the finish line and only has a few things left to achieve -- the most important of those being to secure a spot on the committee for the program's spring fashion show.Caroline finds herself on the committee but at odds with its chairman -- a man named Reed Pendergraft. Reed, an acquaintance of Scarlett's and a graduate student studying math, does not get along famously with Caroline, who spurned his advances at a party earlier in the semester and then watched as Caroline chose a shallow misogynist with a hefty bank account over him. But despite their constant fighting, Caroline can't help but find herself attracted to Reed.Over the course of the novel, Caroline fights an internal battle with herself -- to follow her heart and her hormones to Reed Pendergraft or to keep searching for a more suitable mate whose bank account will ensure that she never find herself starving in a trailer park.When Caroline's precious fashion show receives assistance from the Monroe Foundation, a prestigious, deep-pocketed organization with a focus on philanthropy for needy children, she ends up on a collision course with a past she never wanted to remember, let alone visit.Caroline is a character whose issues and emotions run deep, and with each new challenge she faces, those depths are explored. With every turn of the page, the reader peels back layer after layer of the onion that is her psyche to uncover those things closest to her heart and soul and those things she fears. This exploration of character along with the passion, heat, intrigue, and intoxicating dynamic between she and Reed creates literary magic.Swank's newest installment in the Off the Subject series is an incredible read: fast, yet filled to the brim with a plot that never stalls out. It's the perfect summer read, whether you find yourself on the beach, your own front porch, or like me, inside and listening to a thunderstorm. Redesigned is an absolute must read for women young and old this summer.Swank's third book in the Off the Subject series, Business as Usual, is expected to be released late summer or early fall.

 (And I probably would not have had the pleasure of reading it if I hadn't found it through our friendship.)  My wife and I co-teach a class in beginning Buddhist meditation, and we tell her story in order to illustrate the importance of mindfulness for dealing the difficult situations.

$REVIEW.: As a psychologist who specializes in ADD in all age groups and as a person with ADD myself, I recommend this book to every new adult ADD patient that I see. Soon after it came out, a patient of mine said that he'd read plenty of books that described what ADD is, but this was the first one that really told him what he could and should do about it. I tell patients that medication is only a part of the answer, the rest is changing behaviors that can increase or decrease your chances of success and that this book will help them to do that with some very practical and down to earth strategies. Because of this I try to keep copies of it in my office to sell them at cost, so they'll have it when they leave the appointment. In the last two weeks I have recommended it to 5 or 6 undergrad and law school students.I also point out to them Dr. Barkley's exceptional standards for his own research and for the evaluation of the research of others. His care in presenting results is refreshingly old fashioned, almost quaint in this age of overblown self promotion, such as when he shared his adult ADHD criteria that were eventually published in his master work, "ADHD in Adults: what the science says"[2010], at a Cape Cod workshop in 2006. The results were preliminary at the time and he cautioned us that they had only been validated on a population of males from western Mass., or something like that. We all had to chuckle a bit and at the same time time appreciate how rare and refreshing it was to see such conscientiousness in a researcher; first and foremost Russ Barkley is a scientist and the reader can be confident that this book is based on real research, not just someone's opinions.Lastly, I like the layout of the book. It follows a format that's similar to the 'for dummies' series in that it is well organized with a detailed table of contents and index, as well as visual highlights such as boxes of bullet points, highlighted tips, etc. I tell my patients that it's very 'ADD-friendly' - that they don't have to read it front to back in a linear fashion, but that they can skip around and still get a ton of useful information from it.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this book last summer when I was away on a project and didn't have my undergraduate statistics book with me.  Once I started reading this I was amazed at how clearly and simply the concepts are explained in a way that is fun (for example, in one humorous anecdote the author provides a way for his wife to use statistics to beat him in tennis).While my undergraduate textbook was very well done, this book I found much more effective because it made the subject matter both relevant to everyday life in a very straightforward and enjoyable way.Too often books used in the classroom try to be overly serious and end up making subjects unnecessarily complex.  The result is that after taking a class on the subject, one doesn't want to see the subject matter again and one isn't motivated to learn more.  The result is that one rapidly forgets what the course taught.  That is truly a shame since one needs to learn continuously throughout life.  This book is an excellent antidote if you are having or have had this sort of experience.From the complete novice to someone who has seen statistics before, I would highly recommend this fun and clear book as an excellent way to learn statistics and as a reference.Thank you for your great work Mr. Donnelly!

$REVIEW.: Fireline has everything we look for in a great M/M erotica romance : the angst, the passion, the deep emotional interaction, the vulnerability and sensitivity we wish to have in our men and last but not least the hot sensual erotic sex.There are 2 stories here, "Heat" written in 2005 and "Flashpoint" just released, both e-books now combined in 1 print book

These 2 stories centered on 2 firemen, Chance and Tucker, who are just pure alpha males

Well, what is there not to love about 2 hot firemen in love!Heat is about how they met, their struggle to understand each other, their anguished split-up and ending with their touching reunion.Flashpoint concentrates on their struggle to stay together despite the odds, their fear of losing one another and the strength of their love.Tory Temple bares all with her men and I will read any M/M erotic romance from her.

$REVIEW.: The Spy Who Came for Christmas by David Morrell, was a gift to me from my secret Santa this year.  This was my first encounter with this author and what a great impression he left on me.  David has been called "the father of the modern action novel", when I read that, I thought "okay, lets see how you hold up against my favorite action thriller writers", for I felt very confident that I have only read the best and I was sure I would of read something by him before now, if he was indeed that good.  Whoa Nelly was I wrong!  David is now added to my list of favorite action thriller writers.This book contains a story within a story, both of which are very captivating.  The stories take place on Christmas Eve.  The main story has your bad guys against the good guys theme along with innocent bystanders involvement resulting in them uncovering strength, courage and love that they were unaware they possessed.  The second story has the outline of the story of Jesus' birth yet the characters are spies and this story is fascinating!  I don't know if this story has been told in this manner before or if this is part of David's magic, yet it was the first I had heard the story told in this manner and I do believe it is David's creation.This was a fun and fast read, one that I would recommend to any lover of action/thriller novels.

Sometimes they're fun and worth the read and other times I find myself skipping forward multiple pages. I got this on a free download and I'm not sorry I read it, but I realized I have a lot of books by this author in my library (because he offered them for free) and I'm not exactly chomping at the bit to get to them. They're fairly well written with only a few mild typos. Maybe they're just not my cup of tea. I'll have to think about whether or not I'm going to read any more of them.

$REVIEW.: Thatcher Nalley has created for us here a highly original, very well-told story. Written in the form of a series of letters (never the easiest format) she creates a creeping sense of dread, as well as mystery, about the fate of the residents and staff of the Emerson Rose Asylum. As the story unfolds, the reader comes to appreciate the unconventionality: this was no predictable horror story, or an &#34;institutional&#34; thriller. This was something completely new and unexpected.Unfortunately, Nalley never quite takes us all the way to the finish line. A convincing argument can be made that this is acceptable, given the genre the author creates here out of whole cloth. She probably has carte blanche, then, to create it the way she sees fit.Be that as it may, it's a little unsatisfying never to see an answer to the mystery, nor to learn the fate of the beleaguered patients, or to even find out how well the &#34;revolution&#34; went. It's true enough that real life is like that, that some mysteries are never solved, but we don't turn to novels to experience real life, do we?I so wanted to give this book 5 stars. For sheer originality and story-telling it probably deserves it. However, the somewhat loose-threaded ending, as well as some slight manuscript issues (I think the ms could have done with just one more round of proofreading), demands a slight demotion.Don't let that discourage you, though. If you want a good read, you've got one right here. More than that, you've got a very talented author who is hopefully hard at work on more great stuff. Keep your eye on Thatcher Nalley--she's going places.

$review_text.: I have never been a big fan of reviewing short stories, that doesn't keep me from excepting them of course (cause I do enjoy READING them) but I find them difficult to review. Why? Because with the changing of plots comes the changing of emotions, and if my mind (as muddled as it already is) is forced to become a quick-change artist, then my review must mimic it, (or suffer the consequences.)For example, when I first started Bernard Schaffer's "Women and Other Monsters" I didn't like it.  I felt that the first story was disjointed and forced, and though the overall concept was a good one, the execution lacked that "certain something" that is required when writing in so few words. (Do I actually know what this "certain something" is? No, but believe me when I say that it is important.) Now..having disliked the first story so much, I went into the second with a "slightly less the honky dory" attitude, and much to my surprise (thank God for Schaffer) I finally found what I was looking for, (a well formed, interesting story, with a twisty plot and interesting characters.) While I won't go into detail about each story (because they are short stories.. duh.. 2 sentence from me and I'll blow the ending) I CAN tell you that throughout the course of this collection my views on Shaffer's work changed approximately every 15 seconds, and at one point I found myself so grossed out (I'm talking oh-for-the-love-of-all-that-is-holy-you-are-a-sick-sick-man grossed out) that I actually hunted down the author on Twitter and wagged my chubby finger at him.So what are these stories actually about? (Now that I've pretty much told you that I'm mildly conflicted.)Well, like I said before it is a collection of short stories, (6 to be exact) that span the wildest range of topics I think I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  There were vampires, Death Gods, astronauts, super secret spies (my favorite, and the longest in the book by the way) and...Uh, I can't even say it... let's go with a suspicious wife.Each of these stories were told in their own unique way (folklore, suspense, contemporary) and the writing varied in each, but if I am to solidify my "take" on each of these and reduce them to one word I would go with "GOOD". No, the first story "The Reluctant Death" wasn't all that great, but the second was actually quite entertaining, and as much as I hate for even mentioning the third, regardless of it's "topic," the story was written well and completely caught me off guard which...speaks highly of the authors ability to write "twists."Do I think these stories are for everyone? Absolutely not... I will actually go on record as saying this is a 35% read. Meaning only 35% of you will get and or appreciate the pictures drawn in your head from Schaffer's words.  The other 65% of you (those of you that don't appreciate the slightly insane) will wish you could have your money back. So... here is my suggestion to you.  Think very carefully about the type of person you are and the type of books you enjoy before diving into this one.  It is not nice, clean, normal or meant for children.Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember:  Unless you are 100% certain of the type of "person" your spouse is, don't "surprise" them at work.

$review_text.: I've just received my book from Amazon yesterday, so I haven't been able to complete it as yet, but upon opening the box I was staggered by the sheer size of the volume. Very few books fulfill the promise of their covers; "Meanwhile" does just that, and more. Paging through the contents I was pleased at the abundance of art included from all stages of Mr. Caniff's career. Milt Caniff's exciting brushwork and facility at crafting mesmerizing stories have always held me spellbound, and been an inspiration to me for many years in my career as an artist.Mr. Harvey has done the magical; fleshing out the biography of an icon of the golden era of comic strips and not simply chronicling Mr. Caniff's life, but also taking us behind the scenes and into Milt's mind. It's all here: How Milt worked, what inspired him, the real people who were the models for his characters, the real world of syndicated comic strips.Folks, this is as close to the excitement of time travel as you'll ever get, a reminder of why people waited with eagerness for the daily paper to drop upon their front doorstep in the years before DVDs and home entertainment centers so that they could catch the latest installment of their favorite newsprint heroes. As a previous reviewer so aptly stated, this is an artform that has fallen by the wayside and been forgotten. Today's comics are disposable jokes, akin to the old Joe Bazooka throwaways inside the bubblegum wrappers.This book contains treasure, and would be worth the price of admission at twice its cost. There is a reason why Milton Caniff was called the "Rembrandt of the Comic Strip", and the story is inside "Meanwhile".And one more thing in closing. Milt did this all by himself. No assistants to ink his pencils, no "factory" of interns to rubberstamp the same old hash every week, it was just Milt Caniff and his imagination and brushes and ink-stained hands.

$REVIEW.: Others have already stated that this booklet is basically a review of HIIT (high intensity interval training) and Tabata Protocol. That's true, but she actually makes those methods very simple and understandable (for those who don't have to research everything to-death, who just want the "how-to"). And she throws in some bonus material, which makes it more than that (simple nutrition advice, supplement advice, things to avoid - aspartame and MSG primarily, how drinking water/liquids with meals can sabotage your healthy efforts, etc). She pulls together a lot of new research and tells it the way she believes to be most helpful. I've bought less info packaged in a lot more words, for more money. I recommend this book for anyone who wants a clear and concise, quick and easy read of some of the best health and fitness advice out there today.The nutritional advice is also right in line with a lot of the latest advice circulating now, but boiled down to a very do-able package. She only recommends two "supplements" over and above your vitamins - and one of them is simply cinnamon. Most books on this subject will recommend enough supplements to make your head spin and empty your wallet. And often they are selling those supplements.As far as the offer to write a review and get a bonus - I planned to write a review anyway, so the bonus is just that, but she also states clearly that it does not need to be a 5-star to qualify (no criteria except write one). It may clutter up the reviews to do it that way, but it's at least people who've bought the book who are writing reviews.

I would think there were a lot of BIG secrets. There was passion, drama, etc. And all of it kept you hooked until the end of the book. Midori was one who wanted to have all of her cake and ice cream too. You always have one that is just a psycho and Neveah was definitely that person.

$REVIEW.: Spencer draws on 20 years of Islamic studies in explaining the root causes of Islamic agression toward non-Muslims.  He familiarizes the reader with several Islamic terms and concepts (e.g. fatwah, hadith, sharia, dhimmi, etc..) and effectively dispels many of the myths and misconceptions used to justify modern Islamic agression or downplay its violent tendencies.  He provides a wealth of information about Muhhamed and his successors and is balanced and fair in his assessments.  I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading "The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam" by the same author.

$review_text.: This book is very readable and easy to follow.  It is a series of 10 independent essays dealing with 10 incidents in the Vicksburg campaign.  The essays are well written and researched.  The author works at the Vicksburg Military Park and speaks on the Civil War Round Table circuit so each of these essays is an independent presentation. After reading one you want to read another and another until they are all gone leaving you wishing there were more.  The author uses illustrations well with a picture of the subject of the essay and makes good use of maps.  I have read about half a dozen books on the Vicksburg campaign and this book added significantly to my knowledge of the campaign.  The author delivers a great wealth of information on the subject of each essay.  He certainly uses some old material but only to reassess it in light of some original material.  Where else will you find an assessment of Grant's trust of McClernand, a general he dismissed during the siege of Vicksburg but who had been entrusted with many difficult assignments independent of Grant's oversight during the campaign.

$review_text.: This is the second installment in DeSousa's Creatus series about a race of superhumans who live and keep their skills hidden in contemporary society. Victoria is a hard-edged part of this community, but we get to see her fall for the last man she'd ever consider as her mate--a human. But...is he?There's twists and turns in the rogue plot that was started in the first book, Creatus, along with revelations. We get to see some of the characters from the first book as well, but you never feel overwhelmed by an overabundance of people. Who's next? There are a few characters who are poised to play the next leading role. Can't wait to find out!

$REVIEW.: After an opening that raises a bunch of questions to instantly piquemy interest, there is finally a formal introduction of the maincharacter of the story, Dr. Joe Luca. The early chapters areinterspersed with lengthy exposition that defines the relationshipbetween Luca and co-star David Stern and their pasts, home life, etc.I thought the beginning was front-loaded thanks to these flashbacks,which still happen intermittently throughout. I can see why they mightbe necessary, as the story is largely about the duo's friendship.Still, it didn't flow smoothly to me. The two have led prettyinteresting lives, and their careers (surgeon, businessman, andnightclub owners) are odd matches. Still, these two hatch a plot tosecure money. Joe will wine and dine a chosen investor's daughterwhile David smooth-talks the investor. After this two-pronged approachnets them money they plan to bail and repeat the scam.Of course nothing could be that easy, and Joe meets his match inAlexis, a woman as strong as she is beautiful. With their plot on therocks, their friendship faces turbulence. Murder and thrills follow,but it takes a while to even get to the crux of the plot. There's alot going on in this book (from the friendship to the scam to theromance to the murder), and I kind of wish it just focused on thefriendship and scam, as Joe and David were pretty amusing characters.The prose follows a stream of consciousness pattern. There are a lotof rambling and run-on sentences, which can make things harder tofollow. I thought PALS was decent, but could have used more focus andrevisions to get rid of a lot of the distracting elements.

$REVIEW.: I have read a couple of Webb Garrison's books in the past and always found them interesting, so I was excited to review this one too.Curiosities of the Civil War is what you would expect from Webb Garrison, a compilation of facts and research (and sometimes rumors), compiled into a user friend layman's guide. This tome is quite large at over 500 pages of little know facts and stories related to people, places and events surrounding the Civil War. It is broken down into sections and includes a detailed index.I am not a history buff so I was actually very overwhelmed with the deep and scope of information in this one. The remarks on a particular person, place, event or rumor are broken down in paragraph form, which makes for a quick read and easy to scan, but difficult to understand or reference if you are not familiar with that particular story or event in history.I think anyone interested in the Civil War would love a copy of Mr. Garrison's book and would find hours of entertainment in it. It may be too much and too obscurely referenced for the non-history buff though.(Thank you to Thomas Nelson for providing me a copy of this book to read and review. I'm a member of Thomas Nelson's BookSneeze program.)

Some people don't even consider the baby a baby at that stage, but I believe they are babies, with souls, at conception.  I had to grieve alone b/c of this lack of understanding from the people around me.  It was great to read about someone else's experience with this.

I was very absorbed in this although it is on the shorter side (I think many of Sean Michael's books could use another 50 pages but that may just be me)
I liked all the characters
I did feel that the two Dom's relationship needed a bit more explaining - it's hard for me to picture two Dom's sex lives as being more vanilla...though, to her credit, the author gives us a scene that smacks of reality in that they kind of challenge each other for dominance


I'm a huge fan of the hurt/comfort
The reason for 3.5 stars is this story really felt incomplete at the end - it needed a much better ending to tie the loose ends up and really strongly establish the forward framework...I didn't feel satisfied.

$review_text.: Okay, he writes a nice sex scene and the words are spelled right. But there's "teasers" and there's "you just said these people were infected with something and now you're making prostitutes out of them." That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make me want to buy the next book to find out why, it just irritates me.If zombie sex makes you hot... this *might* work for you. This is NOT "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" meets "Deadgirl." The zombies, at least the ones we see, are not traditional zombies. If you're looking for a sex scene out of the last half hour of "Return of the Living Dead III" (the one with the hot Goth zombie chick) this ain't it. But that being said, he does have fun with the idea of zombie sex and like I said, the scene (singular) itself is not bad. Worth a look if zombies really push your button.

$review_text.: I received a copy of this book in exchange for a fair and unbiased review


I am a history buff and I have read a lot of books about western civilization


However I was utterly surprised to find that I had never heard of Boudicca, the first Queen of England


The more I got into the story the more I fell in love with this amazing, woman.What a remarkable individual! Her drive, her courage, her commitment to her beliefs and her people left me astonished


When her husband the king passed away in AD 60 she found herself facing one of the largest empires in those days the Romans


They were greedy and always looking to take over lands and fortune from others to expend and prosper in the most despicable way

In this story they zeroed on Boudicca&#8217;s fortune


It was stunning as to how she decided she was not going to let them destroy her life.Thomas Baker did an amazing job in presenting the story in the most authenticated way possible
The book is very well written and the plot easy to follow

 The author provides a wonderful mixture of emotions that keep you eager to turn the pages
This was an amazing way for me to learn a part of history I had totally missed, and l loved it.The book is a combination of actual facts and fantasy that gives the story a wonderful touch of the author&#8217;s imagination


Boudicca&#8217;s feelings of hurt and anger, while trying to take revenge against the Romans for violating her daughter were heartfelt

As a mother I feel I would have gone to the ends of the earth just as she did to right a wrong against my family


This is the kind of thing that would make a human being utterly fearless.Thomas Baker provided an amazing story that kept me glued to the pages

When I arrived at the end of the story I found myself wanting to read more

He makes his characters come alive in the reader&#8217;s mind and that was very intriguing to me


Boudicca was a woman so filled with courage, she would give everything including her life to make things right


This is a very powerful story that I would recommend to any person that loves history and is interested in values, integrity, and passion for doing the right thing.

$REVIEW.: Okay, there's no way to sugar coat this, this book was just bad!  This shouldn't have been one book, this should have been an anthology, the individual chapters had very little to do with each other.  The only real thing they had in common was that they took place in the same town and the characters kinda know each other in the way where you look at someone and think that you may have once met them like five years ago.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***Something that really bugged me is that the author is just trying too hard to be gross and shocking.  I know in zombie literature that gore is part of the story element, but this author just takes it way too far.  Instead of trying to cram gore down our throats, the author should have taken more time to develop the characters or the setting.In this book, the chapter numbering jumps from chapter eight to chapter three, how exactly does that make sense?  Not to mention that later in this book there is a scene where a newborn infant starts to feast on the corpse of its mother.  How exactly does a baby that was just born seconds ago feed upon the flesh of the dead body of its mother when the child has no teeth?  What is it going to do?  Gum the flesh off of the body?The scene in the sporting goods store was just a blatant rip off of Stephen King's "The Mist," it even had a Bible thumping uppity old hen trying to rile everyone up and convince them that it's the end times and that the dead rising the God's wrath or some such nonsense.  What's even worse is that one of the characters even mention's Stephen King in an internal monologue.On top of that, you're really telling me that this sporting goods/army surplus store doesn't have hunting rifles or firearms of any kind?  On what planet does that happen?  In this store the guy who owns it "Hubb" just swears too much.  He swears to the point where his insults just don't make any sense.  I almost wanted to say out loud, "I get it, you're old, crotchety and you swear a lot, can we move on now?"Lastly, talking zombies?  Really?  Only Return of the Living Dead was ever able to do this and make it work, whenever anyone else tried to do it, it just came out stupid.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***This book was just boring the characters were uninteresting, I didn't care about any of them, and frankly I didn't care how the book ended and I kept reading it because there was literally nothing else on my Kindle.  Give this one a pass.

$review_text.: I noticed in the promotional material for this novel that there will be made-for-television movies in Germany centered around the series of Dr. Felix Hoffman books.  I think this is one example where I would probably enjoy the movie version of the material more than the written.  Not that the novel isn't interesting, it just wasn't as much of an attention grabber as I had hoped.  Dr. Hoffman is a single, 45 year old cardiologist working in a hospital in Berlin.  During one of the evenings when he is working the night shift in the emergency room he finds a former patient of his who arrives at the hospital DOA.  Well, it seems there is some question of exactly when death occurred, but dead the man surely is.  Dr. Hoffman signs the death certificate with a cause of death which will automatically require an autopsy because he is curious about what medical reason contributed to the death of his former patient.  In checking up on the report Hoffman discovers that no autopsy was ever performed and the trail leads very firmly away from any further investigation of the death.  He really wants to know why.Dr. Hoffman displays a sardonic wit concerning the administrative aspects of his hospitals personnel and that is all well and good, but the novel tends to focus much more on the nuts and bolts of running the hospital with the administrative shortcomings highlighted where they intersect with his investigation into the cause of death of Misha, a native of the Ukraine who is in Germany on an expired work permit.  It was a little too easy to see early on in what direction all of Hoffman's investigations would be heading.  The translation from German to English by Gerald Chapple feels right, as if he has correctly captured the essence of author Christoph Spielberg's writing and yet the characters and locations didn't convey much depth or description for me.  Perhaps in future novels Dr. Spielberg (yes, the author is himself a cardiologist) will expand on the information he gives readers so that we feel we have a better understanding of what his fictional characters look like.
$SUMMARY.: Maybe the movie would suit me better?

$REVIEW.: I received the book from the author for an honest review.Not a huge fan of fantasy and magic stories, I must I really liked this book. The plot was very original and well delivered, with a strong female character that had a nice momentum to the book.Erial, a very young almost Adept woman lived in a castle a princess life, but when she used her magic for evil and not good; even if justified; she's send on a journey to be trained.On this journey she had good and bad adventures allowing her the time to become part of everyday life meeting people in desperate positions; doing what they had to do to survive, but through it all her magic kept her out of harm's way and the colorful characters made the story interesting.One such an character was Kealan, courier, ex-commander of the High Court, protector of the treasury that found himself in trouble with his people and especially his evil cousin Udolen. Betrayed, held as a captive and in-humanly tortured he was left as dead when Eriale found him.Through her determination and sacrifice she learned about people, using her magic as a guide and getting what she needed; to rid herself of her virginity and become an Adept. Young Erial was very nonchalant about her virginity and very arrogant in her own powers as she found herself in the middle of a resistance, helping the villagers to be rid of an Evil Mage. Her own abilities strengthen her to stand up against the evil that lingered every where, destroying the land and its people.The author's descriptive writing cause you to enjoy the path with her, as she paint this very fresh and captivating story with her  pen. Through her descriptive writing you could feel the torture of Kealan as he laid sprawled open on the torture table; you'd smell the different aromas, as it drifted through the jail; it felt realistic and believable; making you part of every scene as it happened. You'd sense the evil magic as it deceive and torture innocent villagers and children from their life force.The author had created a fascinating world where magic is at the order of the day, fairies fly freely around and ordinary people that tried to make a living. It is about sacrifice,and holding on no matter what the circumstances; always finding a solution in the most harshest of times.A great book, that is fast paced and well written; a great book that I can recommend to all lovers of fantasy, but not under the age of sixteen.This was the second book I have read from this author and once again I wasn't dissapointed with her stories, and I for one will be on the look out for more from her.Thanks for the opportunity Olga.

$review_text.: The story starts in 1662 with Patience and Cale Morley and their meager supply of food and continues with their descendents in increments of 11-29 year spans until the present


Each  new date brings us into the November kitchen of the Morley women and in short stories we are drawn into the lives of the Morley family

 Family members are not always honorable but they are survivors

 The women have made many sacrifices as well as the Morley men
 The homestead has undergone many changes by each generation but the kitchen remains the domain of the Morley women.I found this novel to be well written and totally absorbing
 Ms Cooney vividly creates each era and setting and has us understanding the nuances of family interaction  throughout the many changes in circumstances


 It was interesting that she chose to make many of the women single mothers in times when this would have been scandalous but they didn't seem to be scadalized.I enjoyed this book and recommend it as a good read during this holiday time

 It gives an overview of  American Thanksgiving history through the lives of ordinary citizens in a realistic and compassionate way.

$review_text.: Why are the Jews spoken of in tradition and scripture as The Chosen People? Why was such a strict warning put in place to discourage scribes and scribblers from altering even the smallest bits of the Bible? Even as individuals and societies are maturing from magical and mythic to rational and trans-rational understandings of the world, answers to these questions seem to be emerging from the background noise - where, it seems they had been hidden in plain sight.As Stan writes in his most recent news letter, (Oct. 2011), from which I have excerpted and edited a few sentences, "A functioning science of consciousness would have real implications for personal health and global healing. For example... a caring minyan, (group of ten or more persons), can maintain and correct, if necessary the health of each of the individuals. Thus, if one member is deficient in some regard - has an illness or a limitation - they would be brought up to health by immersion in the waters of the consciousness of the entirety of the Minyan. By this means it might be possible to demonstrate the actual, objective healing qualities of a properly functioning minyan/assembly. Diseases of the mind, and also diseases of gene expression, might be directly affected. This is, potentially, a real effect that can be demonstrated to be either true or not. All of this and much more, comes with the recovery of meaningful structure to the letters and the alphabet as a whole."Remembering Arthur Clark's third law of prediction which states, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." One begins to suspect that someone left us a message very much like the Arecibo project and the Golden records placed on the Voyager Satellite. Does this subtract from our notions of G-d and the Divine origin of scripture? It need not. Understanding that all things "happen" in observance of law - laws of nature which can be no more or less than Divine law - no one's belief system is diminished. Contemplative traditions are equally respected as phenomenology can be explained and or experienced at every stage of manifestation.So: 1.  Why are the Jews referred to as "The Chosen People?" Maybe this "refers" to the fact that they were given the assignment of preserving the integrity of the user's manual/incubation box - not just the one for the human race but the whole world of form - the playground of consciousness!And 2.) Why must we never alter the biblical text? The answer may be that embedded in these writings is information so important and so specific a single mistake would be catastrophic.For example; Life depends upon water which must be composed of only two atoms of hydrogen and only one atom of oxygen. Very specific! Change one jot and every tittle is toast. This is a mild example of the extreme specificity of a multitude of life sustaining compounds.In my estimation, Stan Tenen's book is our latest, best chance of recovering a message known but lost then found only to be lost... and found again - a message that not only answers the big questions, but is in fact the medium wherein and whereby the whole show is preformed and reenacted, ad infinitum. Fruit containing a seed, the seed from which grows the tree which produced the fruit - information dancing in and out of form and the void. Sound familiar to you students of quantum misunderstanding and all who zing in the key of zen?Stan is too much the scientist to speculate about the range of implication embodied in his work - but my intuition is screaming! What the world needs now is clarity, resolution and access life's preservative and restorative process'sIn the beginning was the word. And then the word got written in a book. And then someone else wrote a book and the fight was on. Beyond knowledge of good and evil the world needs The Tree of Life - the source of life. A fruit tree bearing fruit which contains the seeds of another fruit tree is a picture with which readers of The Alphabet That Changed the World will become very familiar.The Alphabet That Changed the World is not light reading. In my opinion it could have been better organized in an effort to make it more accessible to a wider audience - my only reason for bestowing four instead of five stars. But these criticisms are peripheral. The information Stan's book contains is far too important to quibble over style and presentation. However difficult - just work it through. You will be well rewarded.

$REVIEW.: Tom Horn has been broadcasting a well-researched and distinct end-times message for several years via radio, internet, and books/DVDs.  People seriously interested in his research and theories will be best served by studying his non-ficton offerings.  The Ahriman Gate provides another entrance point for people who otherwise may not become aware of the end-times message by presenting it through an exciting adventure story with a typical plot of virtuous good guys and diabolical bad guys which reaches a cliff-hanging climax.  Normally I avoid these formula books, but in this instance I recommend the book because of it does more than entertain - it presents the end-times message to a broader audience.  I do not expect events in the coming years to unfold as in this book, and Tom probably doesn't either.  Nonetheless, it is important for people to we watchful and aware of the extreme danger we face from the mix of genetic engineering, one-world government/religion, emergence of antichrists and false prophets, and perhaps even the return of the nephilim.

this book is amazing!!Continuing the journey with our lovely dragons etc and not forgetting the most evil of all Unicorns (you know I want to laugh every time I write that but this character really is no laughing matter) we meet a few new creatures this time, some to love, some to get annoyed with, and some to almost (YES ALMOST) cry for!!!This series is just phenomenal and I cannot wait for book 3
 Sometimes I just want to crawl inside this authors brain and see where these ideas come from


I am guessing there is a mix of very hot and sexy spaces and some very weird dark places that might even compete with my own.Anyway another  5 out of 5 stars for me!! Simply fabulous!V&#34;&#34;V***Review has been done in conjunction with Nerd Girl Official ***

$review_text.: As a Amazon customer and enthusiastic reviewer, I'm curious about how the reviewing system works for both buyers and sellers
 In spite of the presence of fake reviews, I still believe that the review system is honest and helpful overall

I am closing in on 400 book reviews and not only have I never been compensated for my efforts, I have never been offered a free review copy!  I refuse to believe that I am the only honest penny in this very large piggy bank.I should say that I'm not a numbers person and the author's charts and graphs don't show up on my basic Kindle and I probably wouldn't understand them if they did

 I'll take his word that a greater number of reviews correlates to a greater number of sales, although I was buying ebooks on Amazon for three years before I started reviewing and only then did I start reading other reviews
 Obviously, I'm in the minority on this one.As a reviewer of non-fiction ebooks (and that's ALL I review) I think that the percentage of fake reviews in that  area is relatively low, although I do see reviews which are clearly bought through Ffiver.com or some other source


 They are easy to spot because they are short (you don't get much for $5 these days!) and generic and usually not very well written
 If you click onto the reviewer's profile page, you will normally find that it is a one-off (the only review that the reviewer has posted) or one of a few reviews


 You will see the same books and products reviewed by all of these "professional" reviewers

I personally look for the word "awesome" and automatically discount any review that uses it, but that may be an age issue.I can't say that I was impressed with his argument that Amazon doesn't do more to stop fake reviews because the fakes bring in business
 Profit is certainly the main purpose of any business, but Amazon does allow unfavorable reviews (even unfair ones) and doesn't even limit them
 I was interested in his comments about relatives not being allowed to post reviews
 I have seen aunts, nieces, and nephews identify themselves as such in reviews


 In one case, the author's biological mother (who was featured in the book) wrote a review and it was published.I think that this author is wise in advising sellers to avoid trying to game the system

 As he says, all the five-star reviews in the world won't make a good book out of a lousy one

I have seen instances where publishers "over-sold" a book which then got bad reviews because of unrealistic expectations
 For many people who self-publish, simply telling their stories is the main goal


 Writing has always been and will always be a precarious way to make a living and every new author should accept that.I loved the section of funny reviews


 I stumbled onto the reviews of HOW TO AVOID BIG SHIPS some time back and wondered if anyone else was aware of them

 Many reviewers try to inject a little humor into the process and I am always happy to discover them
 Nice to see that this author has a sense of humor and that his investigation into the seedy under-belly of reviewing hasn't soured it.

$REVIEW.: Nightwolves Coalition by Clarrissa Lee Moon is a paranormal erotica novel that is a little of both paranormal and erotica and is pleasingly the right amount of each and refreshingly not too much of either. The novel takes no time in jumping into the action and plot as Catrina Garcia a vampire, newly modified, finds herself in the clutches of terrorists on a passenger airliner where she must find a way to save the day. Both evil and benevolent forces spice the conspiracy as twists take the reader into a suspense filled story and at times an entirely different world.There is a very grounding sediment to the paranormal activity within the book that is quite compelling and utterly believable. The characters are three dimensional quality and the action and landscape unfold before the reader's eyes. Clarrissa Lee Moon truly uses the right amount of everything in her recipe for this book to create a novel about the age old dogma of vampires making it unique and exhilarating.Grade A awesome book!

$review_text.: This was a short and sweet little romance. The last thing Shanelle wanted to do was go to a ball, and meet the shriek. She couldn't get out of it, so she attended with her parents. Before the family was to be introduced, she excused herself and headed to the bathroom. She wished she could stay the night hiding away in there, but knew she couldn't. She had no interest in meeting a man that needed to get married very soon. She decided to sneak into the ball a different way, so she wouldn't have to be introduced. She got caught by the very man she was trying so hard to avoid. She was mad at him that he was not where he was supposed to be.  Every other lady was throwing themselves at him. He liked Shanelle because she wanted nothing to do with him. Well her mind didn't, but her body heated up with each touch they shared. They had some amazing chemistry together. This story may have been short, but it was a steamy little romance. I really enjoyed it. I'm going to give it 3 stars just because of its short length.

Sarah I truly loved each character, and hope that Lilly really get her act together so that her and Jack can be happy together.  But I did feel sad foe Derek, her seemed like a nice guy and really wanted to please Lilly; there in again is where he made his mistake.  Young women can be confused and complicated.  Great book.  Keep writing.

And he lives in a place where everyone is a crook and out for themselves. No, it's a space station, not Washington D.C.I don't read sci-fi books, so I have nothing to compare this to. I gave it 5 Stars because it was funny, I couldn't put it down, the wit, characters and the plot. As the problems magnify, so does the wit and sarcasm.If there's a sequel, put me down.

$review_text.: This has got to be one of the best Christian Urban fiction novels I have ever read.  Keeping Misery Company by Michelle Larks is mind-blowing, compelling and a gripping tale, reaching such levels of intensity that I could actually feel the characters in this novel.The storyline is great, the character development is on point, and the scenes feel like something from a Tyler Perry movie.  Bishop and Queen Clayton are trying to raise a well-bred Christian family.  They are running a well-founded ministry and trying to keep their families secrets just that, a secret.  But it seems like time has run out for them when the prodigal son reappears, with a deadly secret of his own.Ruth Wilcox, the daughter of the Claytons', has run into some family problems of her own, mainly the demise of her thirty-five year old marriage.  Trying to keep up with the times, and not allowing menopause to slow her down, Ruth is in for a surprise when Daniel decides he has other things on his mind than reconciliation.  Can this family pull together and face their adversaries?  Will the walls come crumbling down on this well-loved Christian family?I thoroughly enjoyed reading about this family, their struggles with their faith, love and guidance.  The love that was shared throughout this story was very real, and touching, with twists and turns that made me forget it was a Christian fiction book.  There is scandal in the pulpit! It did not take away from the storyline, but I would be remiss if I did not mention that I read from an advanced reading copy, and there were a few missed words, and some misspellings that I hope the editor or author catches before the book goes to final print.  I would recommend this book to everyone, not just Christian fiction readers, but readers who believe in faith, praying, and blessings.Reviewed by: Cheryl HAPOOO BookClub

$REVIEW.: Lexy @ All Is Read****A MUST READ****I'm beginning this review with a warning, this will not be a drawn out review, and I&#8217;m simply saying that Veiled Innocence has my 100% endorsement of a complete work of art. I'm also stating that I really can't say much about the plot line for I fear it will ruin the entire book for you.  From the conception, to the editing, to the publishing, Phenomenal! Ella Frank has that uncanny way about her writing that makes you, the reader, feel emotions that shouldn't be felt and will lead you down a path only to grab hold of you, spin you around and say, &#8220;Now here is where I need you to be.&#34; Mind Blown! I started out reading this story (even with knowing a few spoilers) only to be slapped into reality because I really didn't know anything at all!Veiled Innocence, in my opinion, at its core is about two lives intersecting at such a time that you think they shouldn't be only to be in the exact spot fate wants them to be. An attraction that morphs into something else that is all consuming and forbidden but when you are reading it, it makes complete sense. With a sense of foreboding throughout the entire story, I found myself laughing and falling in love at the most inappropriate times and had heart wrenching tears, only to be thrust into such passion I couldn't breathe.  If you have ever read any other stories by Ella Frank you know she can mess with your emotional well-being and this holds true for Veiled Innocence. I will however say that this story may in fact pose some triggers for people since you will read about material that deals with death, abuse, sex, some neglect, suicidal thoughts and alcohol abuse. If you're still ok and here with me then read this NOW and make sure you have no other people that depend on you need you because you will read this book in one sitting, it's that good! Excellent Job! I also need to say a Big Thanks to Ella for gifting me a copy in advance and in return I'm giving future readers an honest review. Oh and P.S.... Did you get a load of the cover??!! I can't wait to have this beauty in paperback on my shelf! Gorgeous!

$REVIEW.: Young Heath Wellington III doesn't get along with his father, which isn't a surprise because Heath's father doesn't get along with his father (Heath's grandfather) either. Now Heath Sr. has passed away and left an odd request for his son Heath Jr. to follow, or he doesn't get any inheritance. The will mentions an Inn that the grandfather owned, and he wants his son and grandson to live at the Inn and take care of the animals and people that come with it.This story is told through the eyes of the younger Heath. He makes new friends and tries to understand his father and himself. Even though the book has Thanksgiving in the title, it does not have to be read during Thanksgiving. It's a heartwarming story with charming characters for any season.

People couldn't just let well enough be and she had to face challenges to prove she was more than worthy of the crown and kicked some awesome wolf tail in the process.Loved her growth and coming into her own, incredible story by Ms. Fox. Did I mention the hot sex?!?! Yeah Michelle's great with that; biting, hair pulling, claiming and the rest. Yeah be ready for a cold shower after.Can't wait for the next book. Forever a fan.

$REVIEW.: This one tore my heart out several times and left me rooting for Tessa and Lucas.  What can I say?  Lucas Links can be a real douche bag at times.  Regardless of how many times he messes up, I found myself wanting Tessa to forgive him.  Not too mention the heartache and pain that they all go through as friends in this one.  At times I wanted to punch both Lucas and Tessa.  It's almost as if she was waiting for him to screw up so she could run away but then I had to remember that they are young and are learning what love is about.  Something I think we can all relate to from our personal experiences.  There is something about that first love that always keeps us coming back for more no matter how hurt we get and that's exactly how I see it with Lucas and Tessa.  I love them dearly and can't wait to read more of their story in the upcoming books.

$REVIEW.: This work has many similar themes and conclusions of an earlier work , Raphael Patai's" Arab Mind". Both authors see the Arab world as in a sense imprisoned by its own Culture, unable to escape the force of Custom and Habit. Both see the Arab world as being unable to overcome and recreate itself.A third major voice which reads the present Arab world as one in decline is that of Bernard Lewis.Pryce-Jones focuses on the honor- shame nexus as a major element in the Arab world's relation to others. He also sees how life closed in on clan and tribe prevents the kind of free alliance and association that helps make Democracy move.This work is filled with evidence for the contention that the Arabs not only have not learned  to modernize, but they are not likely to soon.This work does not make for happy reading.

$review_text.: First and foremost, I hate Megan for leaving another cliffhanger! I thought when Epilogue showed up that it was a happily ever after, I So, should have known better!!!I have loved this series since the very beginning. The characters are just raw with issues but, they are all linked as a well oiled family should be! Together they are strong, alone they fall apart. This book was no different. They care about each other and every aspect of their lives.This is Jaylinn and Cooper&#8217;s story. Having both POV&#8217;s makes me see better in both their heads, this one more so because of what happened to Jaylinn and how Cooper handled it. Jaylinn is still a virgin but barely made it out by seconds, when a jerk drugged her and took her to his room. Cooper didn&#8217;t want to take Jaylinn to this party, he knew it was a bad place but she wanted to go. He gave her instructions to stay safe and then he finds her seconds before the jerk rapes her. This traumatizes both Jaylinn and Cooper. Both dealt with it differently and Jaylinn made Cooper promise not to tell anyone.Jaylinn wants Cooper. Cooper wants Jaylinn. But Cooper doesn&#8217;t want to take her virginity from her. He is afraid. He can&#8217;t handle what it might do to them both. They fool around a lot but Cooper won&#8217;t give her what she wants. Jaylinn resorts to some trickery to tease and tempt him, which it does but he won&#8217;t follow through. Then Jaylinn has enough and walks out and Cooper lets her go. Stupid man! I wanted to slap him into next week! They both remain miserable without the other.I felt sick waiting for them to figure things out. I both hate and like when an author can make me feel raw emotions that the characters go through!We get to see some more of Mason and Hailey and find out what the sex of their twins are, and their names. Then Kenzie has her second baby and life seems perfect for all of them. I like the dynamics of family here, that it really is the center of things.

I enjoyed seeing the more sensitive side of Blane and hated that Kade was so miserable. At times the book became repetitive. It seemed like the same thing over and over again. I wanted all the characters to end up happy and the ending just blew me away. Overall I enjoyed the third book in the series but I think it's time for closure.

$REVIEW.: A big part of being a baseball fan is debates the nuance of the game from the stands, or at work the day after a game, or during the cold, quiet offseason. Which current players belong in the Hall of Fame? Who was the greatest catcher of all time? Should there be instant replay? What was the single best game every played? There are hundreds of debates, and each debates has hundreds of opinions. And in the spirit of year-end lists, Sports Illustrated&#8217;s Baseball&#8217;s Greatest presents a colorful and thought-provoking summary of baseball&#8217;s best,  including the top sluggers, pitchers, stadiums, managers and games of all time.It is the ultimate book of baseball top ten lists, compiled through a collaboration of SI writers and editors, ranking the best players by position but also the best base runners, sluggers, defensive players and baseball movies. Who was the #2 shortstop of all time? Derek Jeter. Who is the #9 center fielder? Kirby Puckett. What was the greatest game ever played? It&#8217;s not Jack Morris&#8217;s 10-inning shutout during Game 7 of the 1991 World Series. As a Twins fan I&#8217;m biased towards that one, but it came in at #3. And isn&#8217;t The Natural a better baseball movie than Moneyball? As you can see, there is already plenty to debate. Imagine the opinions, the arguments that a top 10 list in over 20 baseball categories can create!This is a hefty, significant coffee table book, overflowing with wonderful color photos, and classic shots of the old baseball legends who occupied this earth long before many of us. Ty Cobb (the #2 center fielder of all time), Lefty Grove (the #2 left-handed pitcher), and the Polo Grounds (the 8th best ballpark) all make appearances in giant, vivid black and white.One thing I liked about the book is that it doesn&#8217;t ignore the men who have been tainted by their involvement in steroids or gambling, but judges all players by their performance on their field and the field alone. As a result, great players like Pete Rose, Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire are held in the same esteem as Babe Ruth, Jimmy Foxx and Eddie Murray. This is a book of baseball greats, players who contributed significantly to any fan&#8217;s enjoyment of the game, and it leaves the debates to the fans.More controversial are the lists themselves and which players, stadiums and games were chosen and which were left out. How is 1988 World Series Game 1 not in the top 10 best games? Why is 1975 World Series Game 6 the #1? Sure, Fisk waved the ball fair and then jumped for joy after it cleared the monster, but his team went on to lose Game 7 to the Reds the next day. I can understand why Rogers Hornsby is rated as the top second baseman of all time, but why is Joe Morgan #2? Oh, perhaps I&#8217;m letting myself be influenced by his broadcasting. Like I said, the book doesn&#8217;t fault any player for their behaviors off the field.I won&#8217;t give away much more, but here is how they ranked the greatest ballparks. Feel free to debate these for the rest of your life, as I know you have been anyway, without assistance from this enjoyable book.Best Ballpark1. Fenway Park2. Wrigley Field3. Yankee Stadium (the old one)4. Ebbets Field5. Oriole Park at Camden Yards6. Tiger Stadium (not Comerica)7. AT&T; Park8. Polo Grounds9. Dodger Stadium (the current one in LA)10. Comisky ParkAre these correct? Did they leave anything out? Can the Polo Grounds be included when it was demolished almost 50 years ago? These are the kind of questions and debates this book can spawn. It&#8217;s not only a great coffee table book, not only a great reference book, but it&#8217;s a great history book. A tight document of all the greatest things about history&#8217;s greatest sport.Baseball&#8217;s Greatest is available from Sports Illustrated, makes a great gift, and you can buy it wherever books are sold.--Mark McGinty&#8216;s work has appeared in Maybourne Magazine, Montage Magazine, Cigar City Magazine and Germ Warfare.

$review_text.: Didn't love it. Didn't hate it. It could definitely stand to be edited. My biggest issue with the book is the fact that the main female character is supposed to be a huge Bob Marley fan. Both songs the author mentions are most definitely not songs of Bob Marley. Don't worry, be happy is by Bobby McFerrin, and the other song is by Inner Circle. Both songs were written and released years after Marley's death. The author uses parentheses often, which i found unnecessary when the words between the parentheses should have just been included normally in the paragraph.The lack of formatting without indents also made it a bit difficult because it went from one scene to the next and I got lost a few times.There could have been a bit more history with the main male character Jackson as well. I didn't feel like I really got to know him.

The image for the rune Elhaz, is of a lady on a &#34;Elk&#34; descending from the sky on a rainbow bridge
I love the image, but I just wanted to clarify for folks that in American an Elk is a very large deer like creature, and in Sweden and such the Elk is what in America is called a Moose

They are very different animals and so if you are an American looking at this card saying, that is not an Elk, but a Moose
You are correct, it is actually meant to be Moose, but it is called an Elk outside the US
This has subtle but important shifts in meaning for the the card
The reason being that the Elk in the US is more like a powerful Stag, and thus falls perhaps more under that meaning for a creature ie
Kingship etc
The Moose however is a quiet giant of a creature with a someone other-worldly gait like a giraffe

Moose can be so still and quiet they seem to have the ability to hide in plain site sometimes! Anyway, the Moose seems more aligned with the spiritual principle of contact with the higher self, or the soul, and this what the Elhaz rune is pointing to, in part, as as a symbol to represent the powers of this rune.



$SUMMARY.: Is a Moose not an elk? Depends on where you live?

$REVIEW.: Nancy Herriman in her new book, "Josiah's Treasure" published by Worthy Publishing brings us into the lives of Sarah Whittier and Daniel Cady.From the back cover:  in 1880&#8242;s San Francisco, Gold builds fortunes
 And sometimes shatters dreams.Daniel Cady has been searching for the father who struck it rich out West and never returned to his family

 Daniel isn't looking for the man's love, and he's not offering forgiveness


 All he wants is cold retribution


 In the form of cash.Years ago, a scandalous love affair ostracized artist Sarah Whittier from her family
 In San Francisco, she has built a new life out of audacity, talent and an old man's generosity
 The house Josiah Cade left her is about all she owns


 A house that is collateral for her dearest aspiration- a custom art studio run by immigrant women
 They're her family now, and she'll do whatever it takes for them to succeed.But when Daniel Cady arrives in town claiming he's the legal heir, Sarah faces eviction...and the resurrection of dangerous rumors that the house contains hidden gold
 Her future uncertain and her safety threatened, Sarah has nowhere to turn


 Unless she can soften a vengeful man's heart, and they both learn that love is a greater treasure than gold.All Sarah wants to do is put her past behind her and succeed for her success guarantees the success of the immigrant women that have become her family since her own family wants no part of her

 Daniel Cady is looking for his father who abandoned him and the rest of the family to go West to look for gold


 All Daniel wants is a part of that gold as recompense for what his father took from him

 Now Sarah and Daniel are clashing over the one thing that belonged to Josiah and that both of them want, his house

 "Josiah's Treasure" is all about family, the one we are born into and the one we make for ourselves in the world

 This is about pain from our past that is causing us to make our present decisions and how healing of that pain can cause us to make new decisions


 It is also a wonderful romance
 Ms


Herriman has done an outstanding job of bringing Sarah and Daniel to life on these pages


 We root for them to overcome their traumas and for their relationship to succeed
 If you are looking for history you will find it here


 If you are looking for a really good romance you will find it here

$REVIEW.: When I thought Ms. Banks couldn't come up with any character grimier than Keema from the Welfare Grind Series than I am mistaken. Here we have Ms. Jassette, who will stoop to the lowest to keep her glamorous life style maintained. So she sets her eyes on Maceo, a rich drug lord who drops money on her left and right. But keeping Maceo to herself is hard considering he is married to a crazier chick than herself. Maceo's wife doesn't plan on giving up her title to no one. Jassette continues to scheme in every way to make Maceo hers. Making Maceo hers will uncover some very shocking truths along the way. These revelations will startle you to say the least. Read and follow Jassette on her quest for love and power. Along the way ,she will encounter betrayal, loss and face the consequences of her decisions. Overall, it was drama filled and I will read the second part of this series.

$review_text.: **4 Stars**I received a copy of this book from the author for an honest review.MY OVERVIEW: I really enjoyed this book. I love how the author did the good magic vs bad magic.PROS: Chase was a great character, but I think my favorite was Maxwell. :) The house was both a pro and a con for me. I really like how the different powers worked, and then integrated with the house so everyone could use them.CONS: I didn't like, however, how the house was first done. Chase and Andy getting to the kitchen was crazy what they had to go through, and it didn't really make any sense, especially once you learn how the house works.MY FINAL THOUGHTS: Wow! I did not see the twist at the end coming. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.

$REVIEW.: I'm headed to Maui in April, so I figured I'd pick up a few words of Hawaiian besides Aloha. The Illustrated Hawaiian Dictionary fit the bill. Not to complicated, but comprehensive enough to get a clear understanding of how the Hawaiian language works. My only complaint is that it didn't give me enough pronunciation guides on each word, but as I got into it more, that proved to be less and less of a problem. You need to stick with it, if you want to really learn, and I found a site with pronunciation (with sound) which made this book all the better.

$REVIEW.: After being swept away by Belong to You, I was eager to read Made For You and see how things are going with Jack and Sydney. Even though the setting isn't quite as romantic and dreamy as Hawaii, Europe is just as awesome and there was one scene where Jack and Syd take a lovers getaway that is so sweet, romantic, and steamy; I just loved it. Vi entertained me yet again with these characters and I loved that I was flying through the pages with ease.Jack and Syd's relationship gets put to the test as she travels for her tour with a guy who happens to be in love with her. With the story as a whole, I liked the fact that Syd is chasing her dream, rediscovering her passion in life, and learning to do things outside her comfort zone. Probably the only thing that bugged me was how she tiptoed around Jack sometimes, because she didn't want to upset him or do things he didn't approve of. I kind of wanted her to have her own mind, be more independent, but she wasn't as bad as some other female protagonists I've read about. Jack is still as sexy as ever, even if he is a bit possessive. Some times he bordered that line from sexy to annoying when it came to his possessiveness, but luckily I was never turned off from him. I liked how he took care of Syd, how he was always able to read and just get her so easily, but also how he gave her space and freedom to do what she wanted.Made For You is a great sequel and I loved diving back into Jack and Syd's romance. Sienna was just as awesome in this book as the first, too. I really want to see a book about her. The ending was very sweet and totally had me all smiles for them. Vi definitely knows how to write a fun and interesting story with plenty of smexy times between memorable characters and I look forward to reading more books from this author.
$SUMMARY.: A nice sequel to a steamy romance that definitely had me falling even harder for Jack Cole!

$review_text.: The premise of the book is to explain why some insurgencies, consisting of poorly equipped and numerically inferior forces, can defeat powerful nations with are, at least in comparison, limitless material resources.  The author looks at specific factors of insurgencies and how these factors affected the outcomes of eleven insurgencies where the insurgents defeated a larger, more powerful opponent.  He then looks at the role of external support in aiding insurgents, concluding that, statistically, it is the most significant single factor.  The author then attempts to apply his analysis to the current insurgency in Iraq and draws some conclusions concerning the likelihood of an insurgent victory there.The factors analyzed by Dr. Record are the will to fight, including the political will of the antagonists; strategy and the strategic interaction of the opponents; regime type (liberal democracy versus authoritarian) and external support to the insurgency in the form of money, weapons, personnel and safe areas.External support, being the single most influential factor in determining the success of the weak versus the strong, rates its own chapter.  This chapter does not get stuck in a scientific statistical analysis, Dr. Record analyzes qualitatively as well as quantitatively.  His analysis is not a sterile comparison of a set number of variables, but a wide ranging analysis of many factors and indirect influences on the external support and the outcome of the insurgencies.Taking on a hot media topic, Record compares Vietnam and Iraq.  He highlights the differences, the similarities and how these factors can influence the outcome of the war in Iraq.  He looks at strategies, will at all levels, political factors in the U.S. government and external support.  This chapter is a great help in breaking some myths perpetuated by the popular media.Dr. Record's analysis of the American way of war surpasses the insightfulness of the earlier chapters.  He describes how the separation of politics and war violates all of the basic principles of counterinsurgency and as a strategy is doomed to failure in the long term.  His assessment of this way of war is spot on, and explains much of recent American military history.This apolitical way of war leads inevitably to the strategy of attrition, and tactically to search and destroy operations.  This may have many short term successes, and may even be a critical part of an effective counterinsurgency strategy, but its exclusive use is counterproductive and leads to failure.In the final chapter, Record enumerates several conclusions which must be recognized by American politicians, military leaders and, hopefully, by the American public if we are to reach any sort of agreeable conclusion to the Iraq war.This book is very well researched, documented and presented.  Dr. Record does fall into a trap which the book is trying to correct, thinking of the insurgency in strictly military terms and whether the U.S. military can defeat the insurgents in Iraq.  There is no military solution, there can only be a political solution brought about by the Iraqi people.  I believe these minor lapses are more a result of word-smithing in the final copy than any academic mistake on the part of Dr. Record.  He also includes some incorrect data, which is only due to his lack of access to anything other than open source information; but these are almost too minor to mention.I would highly recommend this book to any national level elected political officials, military personnel of all ranks, civil servants dealing with foreign policy or the Department of Defense and to any citizen who wants to know more than the popular media can give you.  Excellent work.

$REVIEW.: The Thrill Of It is something totally different from Author Lauren Blakely. Those of you who are used to reading her happy stories with bright characters will be in for a shock when you meet edgy heroine Harley and her tattooed bad boy Trey.Both coming from dark pasts with bad parents, Harley and Trey use sex and power to take control back of their lives. After a chance meeting that left both of them reeling, they reconnect at their first meeting for sex addicts, neither having know about the others past. Determined to start fresh, they must resist the temptation that is drawing them together, and find a way to coexist without giving in to their dark desires.Harley has a mother that made her grow up too quickly, warping her views on men and relationships. She is a virgin call girl, who uses her power over men to find her self worth. Until she met Trey. Trey makes her feel real, and being around him gives her hope for something more.&#34;I want his touch to remind me that there is good in the world, that two people can care and be close, and it doesn&#8217;t have to be a game, or someone using the other.That there can be something real and true.&#34;Trey deals with his emotionless parents by sleeping with many women. He uses sex to shut everything out and become detached after a painful childhood that he wants desperately to forget.&#34;With all my other women, I knew what they were. They were temporary. They were pills, they were bottles, they were long, slow hits on a pipe. Some left you high for hours, some for days, the rare few for a week or more. But you always came down. You always found another. I kept painting over all the vacant corners in my heart, a new coat, then another, then I&#8217;d try for one more.&#34;Finding a kindred spirit in Harley, Trey is finally able to be himself with no expectations. Although we only get bits and pieces of Trey&#8217;s background for most of the story, his feelings for Harley are blatantly obvious to everyone except for her. He is torn between those feelings for Harley and not wanting to tempt her, leading to some major sexual tension between the two.&#34;I want to brand her with my kisses, mark her as mine, make her lips all red and swollen, so everyone knows I&#8217;m the only one allowed to touch her, the only one with permission, the only one she&#8217;s ever wanted.&#34;The Thrill Of It is a book that will keep you guessing with some major plot twists. Be forewarned that this one is kind of a cliffhanger! You will definitely be craving more Harley and Trey as soon as you flip the last page. Ms. Blakely has done an amazing job venturing in to a darker world, and we already can&#8217;t wait for more of the No Regrets series!

$review_text.: There is something morbidly fascinating about being told that the icons of science have it all desperately wrong - especially when the topic in question is a sacred cow, and involves the most expensive experiment humankind has ever undertaken
Unzicker's latest book grabs you from the title line


In the reading, however, the book disappoints


With his extreme scepticism, Unzicker crosses the line between healthy criticism and hysterical accusation


Some good points get lost in all the hand-waving and ranting
One begins to wonder if the whole venture was intended as satire.Is the name Unzicker a play on the German word unsicher, meaning uncertain? ..


No, in fact, Alexander Unzicker is a real person

He is a bright dude, the son of a chess grandmaster, and a qualified physicist with a PhD
He is not alone in being put off by the mystical flavour of modern physics in its more arcane specialties, such as cosmology and string theory

Unzicker's previous work, Bankrupting Physics, is a satisfying and justified critique

So is Lee Smolin's The Trouble with Physics (2006), and Jim Bagott's Farewell to Reality (2013).This time, Unzicker takes a sceptical view of particle physics
All these particle accelerator experiments are, in fact, a more sophisticated version of Rutherford's classic of a century ago, when he discovered the atomic nucleus by shooting alpha-particles from a speck of radium through metal foils

Some of the particles bounced off at large angles


It's like shooting a billiard ball at a group of balls on the table, and trying to work out the original arrangement by plotting the paths of everything that comes out.Don't forget that these experiments have had a lot of success
We have a very good theory of atoms, the basis of chemistry
We have a workable picture of the atomic nucleus, which gives us the mixed blessings of nuclear power and weapons
We have a pragmatic, if unsatisfying, theory of radioactivity (the weak nuclear force) which gives us diagnostic and therapeutic tools in medicine


And we know that electrons look like perfect points, with absolutely zero size

The scattering profiles of protons and neutrons, however, shows us that they are lumpy: they have an internal structure


Theory and experiment lead us to conclude that the nuclear particles are composites of point-like quarks, bound in groups of three


When we hit a nucleus with enough energy, unstable particles emerge: mesons, quarks in unnatural pairs, which rapidly decay to showers of stable particles.If we put enough energy into the collisions, weird particles emerge, some of them having many times the mass of the regular nuclear particles


It is nave to think these exotic heavy particles are actually constituents of matter

It is like pouring power into motorcycles until they weigh as much as semi-trailers, smashing them together, and seeing three SUVs and a dozen mopeds emerging from the cloud of dust and smoke
The mass-energy of the exotics comes from the vast power drawn from the electricity grid by the accelerator machine
The Large Hadron Collider can only be run in the warm days of summer, when the European grid has power to spare


These experiments tell us how Nature arranges matter and fields at extremely high energies, such as those predicted for the first microseconds of the Big Bang


The &#34;Standard Model&#34; is a workable, though rather ramshackle, theory which classifies the subatomic debris emerging from these experiments.In trying to summarise the value or otherwise of the LHC, we need to realize that this is the last great experiment along the lines which began with Rutherford
The LHC cannot be scaled up by another order of magnitude: the magnets, the power into the acceleration cavities, the tunnel itself - are all at a practical limit

So what has this last throw of the dice achieved? It has shown, through incredibly arcane data processing, evidence for a scalar field, with spin-zero bosons


Neither matter (spin 1/2 particles) nor force (mediated by spin-1 bosons like the photon), this field has to be a fundamental breakthrough in our understanding of reality
While the Higgs mechanism is the headline-grabber, the scalar field is more likely to give intellectually satisfying insights: particularly the problems in cosmology such as the dark energy and the way gravity seems so much stronger than regular matter can account for


Suddenly, the more elaborate theories of gravity, such as Tensor-Vector-Scalar, leap into plausibility.The other achievement of the LHC is an important negative: the no-show of super-symmetry
All the fanciful ideas about unified fields, string theory, super-gravity, etc., demand that regular particles have super-symmetric partners


But super-symmetry, mercifully, is dead


The next generation of theoreticians will not be condemned, as the present generation were, to following this false idea.What, therefore, can we say about Unzicker's book? Unzicker is the kind of person it is good to have on a committee
He points out how silly the orthodox ideas are

But you cannot make a working committee out of Unzickers.If you have read widely in modern physics, including some of the critiques, Unzicker's book will be interesting
But it is not a place for a beginner to start on a journey towards balanced views


Unzicker has something to say


But this time, he has over-reached himself.

$REVIEW.: SMOOTHIE RECIPE BOOK FOR BEGINNERSBy Merlene BishopI would recommend this book for anyone who is interested in getting more nutrion into their daily diet. In today's world, many busy people choose processed, pre-packaged food for convenience reasons. The problem with this is that we give up vital nutrion for convenience. This problematic situation begs for an answer, and that answer, I believe is smoothies; Smoothies are drinks prepared at home with raw, all natural ingredients and a blender. This book has all the info one needs to create optimum nutrional levels, increase energy levels and to eliminate toxins from our processed food diet.A closer look at this would start with &#34;why drink smoothies ?&#34;. Most people want to eat healthy, but many don't know where to start. Including smoothies in your diet is not complicated. A blender does the work, and we choose the ingredients from the recipes included in the book. Smoothies have no unwanted additives, are better than juices, have more fiber and whole raw fruits and vegetables. Sugar is absorbed at a slow even pace when we eat adequate fiber; smoothies promote a feeling of fullness and prevent overeating. They are ideal as a meal replacement and nuts, herbs, dairy and soy milk can be added. Smoothies use whole fruits and vegetables and any excess amount over what is consumed at a meal can be refrigerated.The health benefits of smoothies are endless and include better digestion, reduced risks from diabetes, hypertension,  and heart disease. As a diabetic I think smoothies can be a very vital component in lowering blood sugar. Their use can help manage diabetes by providing a healthy sweet snack or dessert. All of this information is included in the book. Now lets consider the tools needed to prepare smoothies: a good quality blender and several sharp knives, a colander, salad spinner and measuring cups. Additionally, smoothies are beneficial in weight loss since they lower our caloric intake. Overall, smoothies can benefit anyone and you can use them for occasional dietary supplement or incorporate them into daily meals. Smoothie preparation can be simple and inexpensive or involve an extensive financial investment in acquiring all the ingredients mentioned in some of the recipes. Smoothies ~ Bon Appetit !

$REVIEW.: I love love love this series! Each one just expands the premise of the story. It's got a hot survival expert guy and girl. The society as we know now has collapsed and this is about 20 years after. The guy finds the girl living alone after the death of her parents (which taught her a lot of survival skills, too.) They become lovers and move in together. They are living in a type of commune with about 10 other people who have come together. They raise a few animal, chickens, an extensive garden and orchard. They find another group that has come together to survive by driving cattle from grassy area to grassy area. They are ruled by a very dynamic woman who would come between the lovers, It has some power struggle between the 2 groups. Very interesting and I loved this one and the whole series. WELL DONE.

$REVIEW.: All the theories about the mob, CIA, Cubans and FBI seemed overblown. I just didn't see how any of them would risk everything they had to kill JFK. Roger Stone has convinced me that LBJ is the key to all of it. When you see the kind of man he was the whole thing fits, both logistically and, more important, psychologically.  I grew up in mob boss Santa Trafficante's neighborhood and I could never imagine a guy that smart exposing himself to the downside of killing a president -- unless, as Stone has convinced me, he had the protection of the man who became president a heartbeat later.  It takes a political operative like Roger Stone to put the pieces together around the political psychopath LBJ.

$REVIEW.: A long time ago, I just happened to be browsing a leading women&#8217;s magazine and I ran across a great piece of advice for all women. If you must know, I picked up the mag while I waited for my friend to try on a new little-black-dress at one of those trendy boutiques. Anyway, the advice was &#8220;The right man will love all the things about you that the wrong man was intimidated by&#8221;. I don&#8217;t remember the rest of the article, but that line stuck in my mind. Probably because my friend exited the dressing room right after I read that telling bit of advice. I was in awe, meaning my mouth was open, but I still wanted to gobble her as if she was an ice cream cone on a hot summer day.When I read Talk Sexy &#8211; Part One, I had a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu moment back to the day I read that article. Peyton Winter is smart, sexy and with her curves, she&#8217;d rock a little black dress. She&#8217;s the kind of woman any man would be proud to have on his arm, but she&#8217;s also a bundle of suppressed kinky cravings. The type of cravings that intimidate her &#8216;vanilla&#8217; boyfriend and in this installment of the series, he doesn&#8217;t even know about her Phone Sex Operator (PSO) job yet. Considering how he reacted when Peyton confessed she wanted him to spank her, I suspect he&#8217;ll have a stroke when he finds out about her PSO gig.One evening, fate or destiny brings into Peyton&#8217;s PSO life a self-confident and dominant customer who is not intimidated by her cravings. No, this man isn&#8217;t the least bit intimidated by Peyton&#8217;s charms. Instead he flips the script and he talks sexy to her. He&#8217;s able to see through her facade and coaxes her to openly express her wanton desires to him. The demanding voice on the other end of the line drags a suddenly submissive Peyton down the rabbit hole and she loves every scintillating minute of the ride. He takes charge of the call and his commands bring her to a shuddering climax.Now Peyton is hooked. As the blurb for the book states - Their erotic conversations awaken something within Peyton and she soon finds herself longing to meet the man behind the sexy demanding voice with the power to make her feel and do things she&#8217;s never done before. Will she risk the love of a man she knows and cares about to finally experience the kind of white-hot passion she&#8217;s always yearned for?I enjoyed this book for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that women like Peyton intrigue me. I know what Peyton should do and I&#8217;m eagerly looking forward to the upcoming installments of this Talk Sexy series to find out her decision. Will she stop hiding her true nature behind a false mask or will she embrace her sexuality? Ah, I guess we will all have to buy the next books to find out.

$review_text.: This is story of boy loves girl, boy loses girl, boy finds another girl.Nick Kline is a bad boy DJ ... A ladies man, so to speak. Nick is wanting to become the next big record producer. All he needs is for a bigwig to notice him, to believe in him. He finds a chance to speak with THE man (Hollace Westwood), who can supply him with this chance to make it big. Nick knows that if he can get Hollace to give him an opportunity, he'll be golden. The Gods must have been looking down on him, as he is given a chance to produce one the biggest recording artists in the industry, Sadie Sinclair. She is the epitome of fabulous. She's gorgeous, famous and loaded. He knows that he can use his persuasive, smooth moves to make her his, and he will be on top of the world. He figures being her second half will only help his career.In comes Sadie's personal assistant, Gia Grayson. Nick sees something in her, something intriguing. Gia never seems happy though, and she always puts on a brave face in front of Sadie to help pump her up when she is in the studio. Since Nick had this feeling that there was more to Gia, he digs and finds out that she used to be an epic recording artist who had the means to be huge. Gia could have surely surpassed Sadie. Why in the world would she give all of that up?Who does Nick end up with, if either one? Does he find out the reasons behind Gia dropping out of the recording industry? What does life have in store for these three? Does Nick find the fame that he was looking for?Find out for yourself and pick up a copy of Taking something. This is the second book in this series, with Give Me Something (currently free on Amazon), being the first. They are definitely built to be able to read as stand alone's, as I did. I did not have the opportunity to read give Me Something, and I don't feel as if I missed anything. Please enjoy this book, it's a great read!

$REVIEW.: PLAYING FOR KEEPS is the first Kate Perry book I have read but it will not be my last.  The ending was well worth the wait while I read from beginning to end.  You might ask "is there any other way to read a book?"  My answer would be "yes, for books that do not catch my interest with the first few chapters in the beginning - I will read the last couple chapters, at the end, to see if it is worth my time to read the entire book."  Who has time to waste on a book that is not interesting?Well, I can honestly say - I did not have to check the ending to see if this book would be interesting all the way through.  One can almost foresee what the outcome will be for Gracie and Pete; however  Kate Perry has an interesting way of bringing this to life as she includes the problems and/or the dynamics of other family members, friends, and new characters relevant to the plot.  For awhile the reader might think this novel is about the sister, Nel, but Perry weaves the plots together to keep us interested in the upcoming chapters and always bring us back to relationship growth of Gracie & Pete.  By the end of the book - Gracie has shed her doormat shield that she undertook after her mother passed away some fifteen years prior.I have just ordered the first two books of Perry's Laurel Heights series.  I am hoping they are as good as this one.

$review_text.: *A huge sigh in contentment* I loved this book, it was was like double fudge icing on an already iced cake. An extra ending that I didn't know I needed.I absolutely freaking loved Captive in the Dark and Seduced in the Dark. These books had the perfect balance of dark and scary as hell, light bright enough to fill the nooks and crannies, and a solid hand guiding you firmly and safely by the small of your back to absolute mayhem and bat crap insanity, that somehow makes complete and utter sense. Ha ha, ya still following me ;)I didn't get to review The Dark Duet books because I wasn't reviewing books when I read them, but had I been able to, I would have been hard pressed to find the words to adequately express how awesome and (oh yeah, I'm going there) life changing The Dark Duet books are while reading them. They're the epitome of the books that you want to unread just so you can read them again.And now for the icing on the icing, Epilogue.......Completely written from Caleb's POV. I really could end the review right now if you've read The Dark Duet, I could say "Completely written from Caleb's POV, ENOUGH SAID!" And you would high tail your butt to Amazon Kindle and order this book before you could finish "Caleb's POV" part in my review. You want to know how I know this? Because that's all it took for me, my really good friend Mel was txting me and her txt said "so hey, I'm freakin so dang excited about Epilogue coming out in a couple of months girl! Aren't you?" In my mind I'm like "Epilogue? What the heck is Epilogue?" So I txt back, "yeah girl but I'm even more excited about blah blah" she says "GIRL! Epilogue... the unexpected third book from The Dark Duet is ALL in Caleb's PO......."I'm not sure what else her txt said, I was on amazon pre-ordering that ish, It was so bad I tried to pre-order it more than a dozen times! Lmao! It kept telling me "you've already made this pre-order" I'm all "DANG IT! Just let me buy it twice! I need two! No, 5 copies on my kindle! I don't know why just give it to me!!!" Sorry I got waaay off course, ok now, back to Caleb.....So Seduced in the Dark ended (I thought) perfectly. I was very happy with the ending, I felt satisfied and rewarded for all the crap I had to go through w/ Livvie's poor tortured self.However, when I started Epilogue I realized yes, The Dark Duet ended perfectly, and I was satisfied, but why just be satisfied when I can gorge myself, eat until I'm so full I may get sick, drink until I'm spit faced drunk, have sex until I can't walk straight for days........Well? Why the hell not? That's what Caleb's story gave me, and I loved every second inside his head. I loved his side of the story, I love his twisted thoughts and his dominant mind frame.He is an Alpha male of freaking epic proportions! And every one of those 209 pages is all him! Ha ha, hell...........yeah! I can't go to much into a book description w/ out spoiling the first two books for those of you who haven't read them, and those of you who have, ehhh I'm pretty sure you walked out somewhere up there at or around POV *laughs* So, readers who need to read The Dark Duet, go and snag your copies and read them, then go grab Epilogue and come be fat, drunk, and well fu.....ed like the rest of us heathens ;)

$REVIEW.: I liked it, I liked so much that I am a bit sad it`s just a novella. I mean this could be very good full lengh novel.What I like the most is how thia novella isn`t concetrated just on Delany and Wes, but we get to meet their surroundings- their family and work. I was actually so intrugued by the sister of Wes and all the casino thing.I also liked the fact, that the main female character is a firefighter. And how the word &#34;fire&#34;  was popping through the whole book. And the scene how she remembered everything was epic.I love the relationship betweet Del and Wes, how they still love eachother after all those years and how it was shown how much she means to Wes.Can`t wait for the other books of this series!

$review_text.: Nick is unusual, and everywhere he goes, something happens. That something is usually good, but if the situation involves a threat, Nick will take care of it. Unusual in size, aptitude, and generosity, Nick keeps to himself most of the time, making friends with those who need him. What makes him so very different? Pick up this book and begin the journey of discovery!Copernicus H. Stringfellow, Nick, wants nothing more in life than to go around helping those who need him, while staying mostly anonymous. Money, time, and healing techniques are just a few of the things he has to offer. But, he can't be completely honest with anyone for fear that they will either ridicule or use him. Yet, he is not aloof. Nick makes friends, but they sometimes think he knows too much as he uses big words and spouts facts and figures. But, Nick works in a hospital, and miracles seem to happen wherever he goes. This creates some questions in the minds of co-workers. What is a "nurse at large" and how is he qualified? Will Nick be found out? What will happen in his relationships with the friends he has made? Add to these questions the problem that young girls are going missing with no leads at all. How will Nick handle "knowing" that he needs to help Tilly immediately? Can he save her?I really enjoyed this book! It was fun to read about the things Nick did, and when he used his "powers" to do something slightly wrong, to hear him say "Sorry, Mom." There are many interesting layers to this story that will keep you wondering until the end, and I will never look at a Twinkie the same way again! The only part I didn't like was when Nick was in a lake trying to save his life and that of a friend, and there were constant facts and figures. While I understood what was happening, I wanted a little more action there. But, if you enjoy books that are fun with bits of excitement and romance, this book is for you. I received my free review copy from the author, and thank Lorin very much! I would love to read more of Nick's adventures!

$REVIEW.: I borrowed this book because I had loved Drew's Super Powereds series, which were fast-paced, surprising and full of awesome characters who face challenging dilemmas.This book is not quite in the same league.  Don't get me wrong, Pears and Perils is a very fun and light read.  Who can say no to a book filled with professional scapegoats, crazy gods, cat kings and boozy sharks?  The plot was fun, the antagonists believable, and there were many moments that I laughed out loud.  However, Perils and Pears lacks the rich character development found in his Super Powered Series.  There are some wonderful character revelations near the end of the book, but throughout the first 2/3rds of the book many of the characters felt a little flat.I'm still glad that I read it, and I'd still recommend it, but I found it a good read rather than a great one.

I know during those times, women needed to make a good marriage, but apparently she was pretty enough even at her &#34;old age&#34; to attract the hero, who is someone all the women are after.Why then didnt she make a normal match with a handsome guy her own age? they claim she was in love with her husband, even though she was desperate to find someone to please her sexually. it was just weird.first the hero doesnt want to be &#34;saddled&#34; with kids, so he always pulls out. and yet he never does with the heroine. he claims to never have kids, but doesnt mind taking the risk with th heroine.its like the characters dont even stay true to who they are supposed to be so its confusing to read.

$REVIEW.: Like several other reviewers said, I really did want to like this book.  The cover was great and I had hoped that having the first (bad) installment under her belt, the author would get better. That didn't happen. I apologize to the people who reviewed and seemed to really like this book.  Unfortunately I just don't get the rave reviews.  I am neither a friend of the author's nor did I receive the book from a publisher.  I just picked it up at a bookstore... Caution -- possible minor spoilers --.I like "urban fantasy" and the field is crowded with good authors -- Ilona Andrews, Karen Chance, Jim Butcher (to name a few).  This particular book felt like a "Cassie Palmer Lite" or something.  It just didn't have the depth of some of the better novels.  Everything seemed very formulistic and for awhile I thought it might even be a Young Adult novel until the gratuitous bloodshed and pseudo-rape scenes.  Here is a 32 year old "Agent" -- i.e. Angel of Death -- Maddie, who has lived alone except for her gargoyle since she was 13.  Yet she acts like a sheltered, very naive princess.  Guess living on her own for almost 20 years didn't mature her much.  She falls for Gabriel right away -- and I mean right away -- yet she has the hots for her boss J.B. and her kind-of fiance Nathaniel.  She angsts over this like a schoolgirl.  Her love life, particularily her star-crossed attraction for Gabriel, gets very annoying.  Yes she felt that her "Agent" status wouldn't be good for having a relationship but geez, hasn't she ever seen a man before??  Has she been living in a cloister when not at work?Despite her wide-eyed oh-ah over her (apparently) new ability to be attracted to men, she is amazingly accepting of the really bizarre things that happen to her.  She doesn't even blink when she finds she's half-angel and a scion of Lucifer himself.  She sprouts new powers at the drop of a hat and she even knows how to use them in a Mary Sue-like way.  She discovers that all kinds of beings exist that she never knew about and accepts them all with no problems.  Even losing her fingers doesn't seem to bother her; when she's told they'll regrow in time she remarks "Oh cool.  Now I'm like a starfish."The whole book was like that -- one minute Maddy is a whiny schoolgirl, the next she's burning creatures to ashes despite never having had that power before.  Her attraction to Gabriel feels forced and childish, her quick acceptance -- and dependence -- on her bloodline feels fake.  Some recurrent themes like (literally) stars in the eyes and the gargoyle's eating habits got old fast. The writing itself isn't too bad -- it flows decently even if the content leaves a lot to be desired -- and the gargoyle is fun which is why I gave it 2 stars.There are better urban fantasies out there.  I don't think I'll be springing for the next book in this series.

$REVIEW.: Here's my dilemma. I've read most of Jeff Strand's books, and while I do enjoy them, I wish he would balance the comedy a bit more with some drama and character development. I suppose it's just my own personal taste, but the books I've read by Mr. Strand are just a bit too light-hearted. That's not to say his characters are weak. They're not. They're actually very interesting. I just want to know more about them... which, I suppose, is kind of a left-handed compliment. The thing is, his concepts are absolutely fantastic. As a fellow horror novelist, I am completely jealous of his originality and cleverness. I wish I had thought up the plot for Wolf Hunt! I just hope he will start to take his own writing a little more seriously. The jokes and running back and forth wore just a little bit thin for me. I may, however, be the exception. Read it for yourself and see.Rod Redux, author of The Oldest Living Vampire Tells All

$REVIEW.: It's very rare that I give five stars to a book, but this one deserves it! Without giving anything away, a man suddenly faces many major changes in his life that somehow result in his driving Mango Bob, a cat, in an RV cross-country to return him to his owner.  New relationships and adventures are found along the way.  I really enjoyed the development of the main characters and their relationships; they all seemed so likeable and approachable.  Although there is quite a bit of detail  regarding RV living, I enjoyed the realism it gave the story.  This book is a quiet kind of wonderful; it was a great way to spend a lazy summer afternoon.  I'm left wanting to know more about these characters and can only hope this does indeed become a series.  I'm not exactly sure why I enjoyed this book so; the important thing is that I did.  I am recommending it to all of my friends and family.  And, for those who want to know, it's a very clean read; I don't recall any cursing or adult situations.

$REVIEW.: If you are looking for some heat this holiday season then this short story will warm you up


What could be the worst thing to do at the company Christmas party? Go home with the boss

But heck, Angela knows she's good and she can find another job and Ryan is utterly delicious
But when she agreed to go home with him she wasn't expecting that he'd have his best friend there.Of course Ryan didn't expect it either
Wade is ruggedly handsome, a cowboy
Ryan is sophisticated model good looking


I mean..

what more can a girl ask for Christmas? I'd say she was a good girl this year!Ryan has never had a problem sharing women with Wade in the past but something about Angie wakes every possessive instinctive.This story is short and it is an erotica story so there's a lot of sex and not a lot of the actual storyline so if you're looking for something hot then this will be for you.Toe Curling Rating: 4

Open the items in the trunk. Figure out the puzzle. Be done with it. I will probably wait until the last book in the series which will probably be #52 to find how this ends.The book still had quite a few typos and that was only in the parts I actually read.

$review_text.: I cannot believe how much I disliked this book. I knew from the synopsis that this book was going to be a bit cliche but I loved Michelle A. Valentine's previous books so I gave it a shot. Um...no. Just no. This book is a cross between Real by Katy Evans and every other New Adult book out there. Not original at all.Anna is this super innocent 21 year old who is essentially running away from home and living with her Aunt and cousin across the country. She meets Xavier on the plane, has no idea who he is but notices how incredibly sexy he is. Of course he notices her right away and takes a quick interest in her.Anyway of course now she's completely infatuated with him and can't stop thinking about him. He in return keeps talking about how he's &#34;evil&#34; and &#34;not good enough for her&#34; which by the way is so freaking annoying. I'm tired of the guys in books always coming up with stupid ass reasons as to why they can't be with the heroine. Always insisting they're not good enough. And then of course, he has to go and messes up in a HUGE way that left me literally screaming with rage at no one in particular for about 30 minutes.At this point I hate Xavier and I think Anna is so beyond naive, I can barely stand them. But then of course Anna continues on her stupid ways and lets just say it gets worse from there.This book literally takes place all in the span of about two weeks and yet by the end of the first week their declaring love and going at it like rabbits? Oh and apparently she &#34;read&#34; somewhere that you can't get pregnant unless it's a certain week or some other stupid reason so they don't use protection...The list can go on and on but I'm going to stop there because I don't want to spoil anything else for anyone. I'm upset that I didn't enjoy this book but I guess it just wasn't for me. Yes, there is a second book and it will be a continuation of these characters. Will I be reading it? NOPE.

$REVIEW.: 4 AND 1/2 STARSThis Lovecraftian story is the debut novel of author Brett J. Talley and is one of the better first novels I've read.  Talley's atmospheric style certainly doesn't feel like a first time writer and I was even more impressed with how frightening it was to read.  It's not often I look up from a horror novel to peer around the room or through open doorways because of a strange noise or fleeting shadow I caught from the corner of my eye.  This book caused me to do that and I'm not ashamed to admit it.  It has some genuinely scary moments that surprised me and caught me off guard.At just over a lean 250 pages, "That Which Should Not Be" has the feel of an epic, taking the reader into the deep woods on a hunting expedition, to a monastery, an insane asylum, and out to sea on a cargo ship.  The format reminded me of Creepshow, with numerous stories tied together by a wraparound main story.  I found each story to be quite captivating and realistic.  Talley did a great job of just giving the reader enough information to maintain the suspense throughout each tale.  I am definitely looking forward to reading more by this author and don't let the strong Lovecraft mythos scare you away.  Lovecraft or not, it is very well written and dripping with atmosphere and should easily please fans and newcomers alike.

$REVIEW.: It is well documented that the election of 2008 captured the profound interest and imagination of the U.S. and the world in ways that had not been seen in over 40 years. Legions of followers witnessed every nuance from the caucuses of Iowa to the historical impact of Inauguration Day. `Obama: The Historic Journey' (Callaway/New York Times) captures every step along the way in magnificent detail in both it's large format photographs and insightful writings that allow readers to re-live moments from his break-thru speech at the Democratic Convention in 2004, to the primaries, debates, the selection of a Vice-President, the convention in Denver, the battles with John McCain (and the Sarah Palin sideshow) to election day and the ultimate Inauguration. In addition to the beautiful photographs, there are transcripts of each of his major speeches as well as a series of well written perspectives from the likes of Paul Krugman, Maureen Dowd, Caroline Kennedy, Nicholas Kristof, David Brooks, Tom Friedman and others. Despite a proliferation of Obama books following the election, `Obama: The Historic Journey' is the one volume that presents the journey with the same outsized impact that epitomized the campaign itself.

$review_text.: Let me say first that I am a fan of John Barrowman.  I like his work, have seen him on stage, screen and TV.  That having been said, I found this book (and it's predecessor) to be a bit of a cheat.  After going to great (sometimes absurd) lengths to create an illusion of intimacy with the reader, he shows us a carefully crafted version of himself that is no more, nor less that what what will bolster his existing public persona.  That is not intimacy, that is manipulation.  His rather enormous ego can also be distracting (Is he really saying with a straight (pardon the pun)face that Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd were his "co-stars" in De-Lovely?  If you blinked, you missed him...)  He is a charming and talented man, both he and his readers would have been better served with more frankness and less posturing than is on display here.

$REVIEW.: I normally would knock this story down due to editing issues; however, I loved the characters so much that I don't care


While the editing is lacking the characters are rich and well developed as well as the world building
 Yes some of these are my pet peeves, but, would you rather have a perfectly written story with lacking characters or world building, or a great story with some spelling/word usage challenges?I think Grim is amazing, and Lisa is very strong while still being extremely supporting and loving of Grim


 I loved everything about them, from the way they respect each other to their family dynamic.Lisa is strong without being a B****
 You know what I mean, those heroines that are so awesome but they look good by making the guys look small, or by everyone wanting them


 This is so much better, Lisa is a genuine loving person that builds people up vs tearing them down


 She always gets her way, but she is so nice and warm people want to do things to please her
 Grim is so affection and love starved, I love the way this family fills his life and lets him see his own value, and by doing that, show the rest of the warriors theirs as well.I downloaded a sample and I swear I almost deleted it based on the 1st page, I could not reconcile the way it was written with the great reviews


 Skip the poorly written I guess synopsis and go straight to the book
 As always I recommend seeing if the story sucks you in, I had downloaded several samples and this was the third one, I was so frustrated when I ran out of sample and was irritated waiting the length of time it took to say Purchase now and have it open, I was already that immersed in the story

 It was 10:30 pm when I downloaded it and I finished around 1:00 am and immediately downloaded the novella that comes after this, although by then I was tired enough that I set my alarm early to read it this am :)


 I have also purchased her other first series as so far I am in love with the way she does her characters.This author is a must purchase for me @ least on this series
 Try the sample from the first chapter on and I bet it sucks you right in too.Note to author:  I would go through some of the reviews you have and for people that mention your editing but like your style asking them to beta read for you

That would clear up a lot of the glaring issues until you feel you would like to work with an editor

 While I don't like doing the beta myself, I am sure you would have quite a few volunteers were you to put it out there.

But while Ilona Andrews stories seem to always have some measure of Harlequin Romance feel to them, "Silver Shark" is particularly "romancy".  That doesn't make it a bad book, but be prepared for a transformation of the narrative from Sci-Fi into sappy soap opera half way through the storry.

$REVIEW.: I have read multiple other books by this author and quite liked them.  I despised this book for what I hope was a mischaracterization of "Earth" women.  Women in this book (and please learn when to use women vs. woman) are portrayed as feeble minded and weak.  Out of around a thousand kidnapped women, only 5 or 6 of them wanted to leave.  Seriously?  To top it off, those 5 or 6 were so inferior that they didn't even stand a chance at escape.  The author made it quite clear that only virgins were desired and kidnapped, but yet they were morally loose enough to commit sex in public immediately after their weddings.  Drape or no drape, it was still sex in public.  I was definitely not won over by the fact that the men were so pathetic they ejaculated almost as soon as the sex began.  "I can't wait."  Really?  Now we know why they had to have virgins!  No experienced woman would tolerate it.

They are tied together by the mystery of Jones' background and her developing personal relationships, while each has an individual theme in the mystery Jones is focused on solving.This one has a theme that is not for the squeamish.  That does not make it less important as a social issue.If the series has any drawback, it would lie in the often thinly veiled hostility towards government-employed law enforcement personnel.

I found some of the technical parts very difficult to follow, so I just skimmed those, without feeling that I missed anything
Since the main point of the book is to discuss what is supported by data versus what isn't, it didn't really matter that I did not understand everything
Author Jim Baggot's book did make me feel better about the poor review I gave to Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe


 Baggot writes in a very conversational tone and with a good sense of humor

Even his footnotes will amuse so I recommend you read those

Baggot will also make highly theoretical statements but then back them up with concrete, everyday examples


I recommend this book for anyone very interested in the history of physics or just in physics but I do not recommend it for the casual reader.

$REVIEW.: My favorite snuggle book is the Psalms of the Old Testament.  My second favorite snuggle book is Come Away My Beloved.  It is written as if God is speaking directly to your heart, mind, emotions and situation.  If you need to feel the snuggling of the Heavenly Father, if your heart desires to be cuddled, then this is the book.

$review_text.: I was in a reading slump. Sick and tired of the same plot that a lot of authors have been writing, where the virgin falls for the bad boy. Love's characters were a REAL kind of people! They made mistakes, and god forbid, the h actually has sex with more than just the H!This novel was refreshing, realistic, and wonderful! As a long time fan of Halle, she did not disappoint! Love is character driven and makes you feel connected to them. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. And I'm sure I'll be having a reread very soon!
$review_summary.: Finally, a new kind of romance.

$REVIEW.: Through the Third Eye kept me enthralled throughout the entire journey. As a practitioner, I found the use of past life regression as a means to discover their secret treasure to be unique.  It allowed for the exploration through the history of time. This story was told with great attention to detail interspersed with some lighthearted humor. I was left on the edge of my seat wondering what they would find next. I highly recommend this book. You may never look at the world in the same way again.
$SUMMARY.: Kept Me Enthralled!
