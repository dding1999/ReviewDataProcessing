$REVIEW.: Barbet Schroeder had long wanted to bring Bukowski to the screen, and finally found his vehicle in &quot;Barfly,&quot; based on a screenplay he commissioned from Bukowski, who wrote a very amusing book, &quot;Hollywood,&quot; on the making of the film, which is a must read for anyone who wants to gain a full appreciation for the movie.Rourke was not Bukowski's first choice.  Afterall, Rourke is an East Coast type, but he managed to fit himself to the role in fine gusto, taking on the persona of Bukowski in his early years in LA.  Bukowski considered Faye Dunaway one of the last big-time Hollywood actresses, and speaks of her affectionately throughout his book.  Bukowski didn't know what to make of Schroeder, who seemed to be singularly obsessed with Bukowski's life and times, to the point of trying to live it to capture the full essence of LA's skid row.  Bukowski himself was enjoying a measure of success by this point, driving a BMW, an enjoying the finer things in life.The film moves along at a brisk pace, bringing together a motley assortment of characters with Rourke playing his role to the hilt.  Dunaway is first class as his punch drunk love.  This is Rourke at his smarmiest best, take him or leave him, as one would Bukowski, who isn't everyone's bottle of muscatel.

$review_text.: Despite its light-hearted and misleading marketing campaign (with photos of a grinning Doris Day and Frank Sinatra--who spents much of the film scowling-- and that title, who wouldn't expect a typical Warner Bros


featherweight musical of the early Fifties?), this under-appreciated melodrama is any but.Filled with anguish, repressed love and oceans of tears (all set against spectacularly phony Hollywood soundstage sets), this is Warner Bros.' counterpart to Douglas Sirk's glossy over-the-top Universal tear-jerkers such as  Magnificent Obsession and Imitation of Life that same decade
(Story--by Imitation of Life author Fannie Hurst--had earlier done duty as the Thirties tear-jerker Four Daughters with John Garfield.) This time, Sinatra's the downtrodden bounder who stirs up household of sisters, with Day and Dorothy Malone as two of the three sibs


(Fourth sister was evidently lost in translation, who presumably ankled for cheerier climes.)Although the characters' bizarre motivations don't bear close scrutiny--why are all these thirty-something women still living at home




.and  dating and/or marrying men they don't love or even appear to even like very much 




.and why does rejected suitor Gig Young continue on as a boarder in their home after being left at the altar by one of the gals?--it's a riveting if superficial three-hankie epic for fans of the genre
Several good Day/Sinatra numbers are logically interpolated into hackneyed plot and strong supporting cast includes Ethel Barrymore as stereotypical all-knowing aunt.Corny though it may be, it's surprising that this star-studded weepie isn't more popular than it is.

$REVIEW.: As a Gen-Xer, I grew up watching Transformers with a zealotry only surpassed by my love of Star Wars. I owned all the toys, comics, and other fan-related merchandise. I even watched the original film on VHS so much that the tape turned to shreds. Since a kid, I've been dying to see a live-action film made of one of my most beloved franchises. Enter Michael Bay and all my childhood fantasies of seeing a great Transformers film have been ruined.I was not happy with the direction of the first film. In fact, even though I hated it, I felt it did have some redeeming qualities which made it at least worth watching. With that said, I dreaded seeing the sequel. But nothing could have prepared me for just how terrible Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is. There have been some real sci-fi stinkers released at the movies over the years (Streetfighter, Mortal Kombat 2, Godzilla, Highlander 4, Matrix Revolutions, Attack of the Clones, etc). But until watching RotF, I have never left the theater feeling as though all of my brain cells had died from watching a film. Only reason I didn't walk out of this movie is because I had gone to see it with a friend. Without a doubt, RotF is the single most mindless piece of garbage filmmaking I have ever seen in my life.The positives:-Some well-choreographed action scenes.-Improved battle scenes between the Transformers.-Megan Fox-Peter Cullen/Frank WelkerThe negatives:-Way too much cursing (even for a PG-13 movie).-Too many raunchy scenes-Toilet humor.-Bad acting.-God awful script.-Nonsensical plot.-Terrible robot design.-Racist "black-face" vaudeville robots.-Too much Mom and Dad-Excessive running time.-Shia Lebeouf-Michael BayIt's a testament to how dumb our culture has gotten when a film as crude, silly, and tasteless as RotF can go on to become one of the highest grossing films in history. Thanks to the success of this mindless film, it's a good bet that Hollywood is sure to make fewer good films in the future in order to spit out more rubbish like RotF.I am convinced that so long as Michael Bay is at the helm, I will never watch another live-action Transformer movie. In fact, I will probably never watch another Michael Bay film period.My advice to anyone with half of a brain or even an ounce of good taste is to save your money and stay far away from this despicable train-wreck!Zero Stars.

$review_text.: This was a surprisingly good documentary

There were no laugh tracks or even whitty quips by way of writer/producer and professional comedian/satirist Harry Shearer

This film portrayed the death and devastation that hit NO, but more importantly it explained why the real villian was not mother nature, but ineptitude

The ineptitude came by way of the Army Corp of Engineers which built the levees that surround the city to only withstand a level 3 hurricane


Anything higher had the potential to devastate the city and inevitably did when parts of the city flooded

Adding insult to injury, FEMA was slow in coming to the aid of the residents and this only added to the chaos and devastation that the residents of the city (most prominently the poor, sick, or elderly)had to endure.This film explains why the residents of NO blame the government and its agencies for not acting faster or offering them adequate protection against a catastrophe of monumental proportion


It was extremely well-done and was not only interesting but involving.

This is one of the higher intensity workouts Denise has come out with and I really appreciate that because you can often modify down a workout by doing a lower impact version but it's difficult to modify up a workout that's too easy. My favorite is the kettlebell inspired workout. If you do all 4 sections together I gaurantee you will be sweating and burning!

$REVIEW.: Amazon seems to have two "Bay Cove"s mixed-up: The dvd cover shown above refers to the 1987 TV film with Pamela Sue Martin, Tim Matheson and Woody Harrelson; yet the description on one of the pages for "Bay Cove refers to the 1993 TV series with Isla Fisher and Christopher Fare.I'm only posting this so you make sure you get the right one.The 1987 film is well worth catching

Martin and Matheson star as a couple who move to Devlin Island off the coast of Massachusetts and run afoul of a coven of witches
Despite the low-budget this TV film is well made and creepy, albeit not gorey


It is actually better than the similarly-themed feature films "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Amityville Horror (1979)," maybe not on a technical level, but at least as far as story, locations and cast go
Pamela Sue Martin (aka Nancy Drew) is a quality protagonist and very alluring


The only downside is that the final act is kind of cartoony with its overt depiction of the coven and their diabolical doings, but that's pretty much always the case when films attempt to depict these types of occultists (look no further than the final scenes of "Rosemary's Baby").

Who else could hit the road with a completely offbeat, dark, and essentially fabulous production?  Name one person...I dare you.  The DVD of the show is a different edit from the version aired on HBO in August of 2001.  And the audio and video quality have been amped up (hence the DVD right?!), to a brilliant effect.  The quality is crisp and clear, and through headphones the sound is amazing.  Theatrical in nature, Madonna's &quot;Drowned World Tour&quot; has now made way for her more straight forward &quot;Re-Invention Tour&quot;...but don't let the lack of catalog hits fool you.  This show will make you think and showcases Madonna's tremendous experimentalist ideas.  A definate must see.

$REVIEW.: Mr. Smith Goes to Washingtonis already known as a classic film about American politics. What people sometimes forget is how well it's aged. Sure, it's a black & white film from 1939, but it feels surprisingly modern. The film is pretty sophisticated about how politics is really conducted, but also has a feel-good outcome. I recently re-watched this movie to help explain to my little sister how a filibuster works. It helps to know a bit about politics before watching the movie, or at least know what a filibuster and quorum are. It also raises some interesting political ethics questions (is it right to filibuster a whole bill just to oppose one bad provision), but that's probably beyond the scope of Hollywood.

$REVIEW.: In all honesty, I figured the plot for The Batman vs Dracula would be a bit farfetched and unbelievable but, much to my surprise, it was anything but
It's much more Mature and adult-oriented, in my opinion
The story begins with Penguin finding out about a treasure that was buried in a Gotham Cemetary
Only the Joker knows of the treasure as well


Yet, while Joker is squaring off against The Batman, Penguin finds its' whereabouts

Unknowingly, Penguin cuts his hand on his umbrella and brings Dracula back to life

Soon thereafter, Penguin becomes a slave to the Prince of Darkness &, in no time at all, Gotham's Denizens starts becoming an army of the undead for Dracula

Heck, The Joker even becomes one


Vicky Vale, Bruce's love interest, figures in there as well


From that point on, it's a race for The Batman to come up with a solution to the problem and face off against Dracula.Rino Romano, Alastair Duncan, Peter Stomare all do amazing voicework in this feature-length animated film.I really enjoyed it and I'm sure you will, too.

$review_text.: Escape from New York (Special Edition)When the film was actually released in India, there were only a very meagre number of people owning television sets or for that matter even VCRs in the entire city of Mangalore. I saw it on the big screen and was immeadiately hooked to the film. The popularity spread through word of mouth and it ran for not less than thirty days. That was a record for any hollywood movie including Star Wars. Eventhough, when viewed today, in 2009, youngsters might complain that the theme feels rather ludicrous (the concept of Manhattan island becoming a maximum security penetentiary in the year 1997, seperated from the rest of the United States and patrolled by highly trained cops.) Kurt Russell plays 'Snake Plisken' a decorated Vet, gone renegade, who is sent on a mission into Manhattan island to rescue the President of the United States, when Airforce One crashes into New York.Donald Pleasence plays the President, held hostage by a criminal named 'the Duke' of New York (Issac Hayes).John Carpenter's crisp direction,the gripping score and the low-light cinematography will surely have you at the edge of your seat. Each and every character is well written and portrayed. Ernest Borgnine as a cabby, Harry Dean Stanton as 'Brain', Adrienne Barbeau, another Carpenter regular, portrays Brain's girl-friend, Maggie. All give terrific performances. Many of my friends have critisized the film as a mere two dimentional pulp. But probably they are comparing it to modern day special effects wizardry in films like The Terminator etc..But I still maintain that in the 1980s there was no other film in the futuristic category which earned it such a mass hysteric CULT following that has not waned even to this day. Even John Carpenter could not come up with a good follow-up movie. 'Escape from L.A', is nothing even remotely near 'Escape from New York'. The film even created a whole new generation of Kurt Russel fans, which significantly benifitted Mr.Russell's career graph. I strongly recommend the film to all die-hard fans of John Carpenter or Kurt Russell. Even if you are not a fan, every time you see this DVD from Amazon, you will get the urge to watch it again and again. The images in the restored version are really good. The sound quality also has been re-masterd, from the original print. If you have a good home-theater with either Dolby 5.1 or DTS, then this film is a treat to watch. You will wonder,"Gosh, the film ended so quickly." That is the magic of this film. 'The Duke of New York", Issac Hayes travels in a special Cadillac fitted with Chandeliars in the front. Plus he has his own theme, which plays ever time the car rolls into frame.Out-Right, Top-Class Entertainment that can be viewed any number of times. Take my word for it. You won't regret buying the DVD. 100% POSITIVE. A word of caution to other buyers from India: A cheaper DVD marketed by an Indian company is available in India, from any retail outfit. But folks, you ARE going to be highly dissapointed because the DVD has been made from an Indian Censored print of the 1980s. The length is way short and all the good scenes are missing. So my advice to Indian buyers is, if you can access, buy the Amazon DVD. It is in a class of its own.

The arrival of Cousin Julia (Deborah Walley) causes some fireworks, with both Nancy and Julia fighting over the affections of the new schoolmaster, before Nancy falls in love with the mysterious Thomas Hamilton.  The story is loosely based on "Mother Carey's Chickens" by Kate Douglas Wiggin.Burl Ives, Dorothy McGuire and Una Merkel co-star in good supporting roles.  Other roles are taken by Eddie Hodges, Michael J. Pollard, Peter Brown, Wendy Turner, James Stacy and Jimmy Mathers (younger brother of Jerry 'Beaver' Mathers)Hayley Mills and the cast sing the entertaining Sherman Brothers score, including "Flitterin'", "The Ugly Bug Ball", "The Pink of Perfection", "On the Old Front Porch",  "Femininity" and the Title Song.Disney has been `kind enough' to give SUMMER MAGIC the full anamorphic treatment.  The 16:9 image is good, if unspectacular.  With the studio in the bad habit of releasing most of it's back-catalogue titles in fullscreen, SUMMER MAGIC (one of the most-anticipated DVD releases) in widescreen should be quite an event for fans of this delightful movie.

$REVIEW.: Bush is not the enemy here, Michael Moore is
Do yourself a favor


If you must see this piece of propoganda, be sure to immediately view the REAL documentary called FarenHYPE 911 right after seeing it


I did and i was shocked at how Michael Moore lied to us
He distorted and fabricated the facts, he lied, he twisted the truths all in the self-serving name of making money to help line his pockets with money and help pay for his 2.5 million dollar condo
This guy is a sham
The fact that the public believes him as if he is some kind of truth-telling god is a sin of the worst kind
I'm glad people are starting to come forward with the truth about how he lies and distorts the facts

Books and articles are being written about him, and they are not flattering at all

 What is scary is that before i saw FarenHYPE 911, i actually believed his movie

Thank-you to the producers of the REAL documentary for shedding light on what a liar he is
He totally dishonored and  disrespected the families of the men and women who fought in the war for his freedom by making his movie

He needs to be stopped

And if you want the truth about his other piece of crap, go to [...]
The only GOOD thing about Farenheit 911 is that Michael's scruffy, obese, over-fed disgusting face and body are seen in the movie for less than five minutes
Why doesn't he take his millions and either get liposuction or join a diet clinic instead of forcing his lies and distorted facts on the public? I totally hate this turd of a film-maker
Please boycott this movie and see FarenHYPE 911 instead

You'll never want to see another Michael Moore film after watching it.

$review_text.: AWAY FROM HER is a remarkable film from Canada for many reasons: the subject matter is tough but handled with sincerity and candor, the story from a short story by Alice Munro has been beautifully adapted for the screen by young and gifted director Sarah Polley, and the cast is homogeneously excellent - topped by shining Oscar worthy performances by Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent. Polley has elected to share this tale of descent into Alzheimer's Disease and it effect on all manner of people by taking a subtle fragmentary approach to revealing the story and character development and in doing so she gives a feeling of how the world slowly loses its sense as the brain bumps around in deepening chaos.The setting is Ontario, Canada where a couple has lived in a family home for the past twenty years of their 44-year marriage. Fiona (Julie Christie) remains a lovely woman but her memory is slipping and her husband Grant (Gordon Pinsent) adjusts to her diminished ability to cope with compassion and love. Through flashbacks and little moments in the present, the encroaching effects of Alzheimer's Disease become more prominent and together the couple arrives at the decision that placement in Meadowlands, a home of Alzheimer's victims, is necessary. An obligatory separation of 30 days 'while patients settle in' is followed by Gordon's visiting Fiona, only to discover that she doesn't recognize him and has transferred her affection to a mute wheelchair-confined Aubrey (Michael Murphy). Trying to understand this change Gordon visits Aubrey's wife Marian (Olympia Dukakis) and despite the devotion each has for their spouses, they seek some sense of security and rekindled meaning to life by dating. 'It's a strange world' they continue to sigh, struggling to adapt to the life into which they have been thrown.The cast is brilliant: not only does Julie Christy deliver a carefully studied, nuanced, informed portrayal of the Fiona at odds with diminishing brain activity and Gordon Pinsent matching her with a man torn by the throes of their misfortune, but the smaller roles by Dukakis and especially by Kristen Thomson as the worldly wise and kind nurse Kristy are so well defined they astonish us. The isolation of the story is captured in the snows of Ontario by cinematographer Luc Montpellier and Composer Jonathan Goldsmith has fashioned a musical score that relies inventively and subtly on Bach. Sarah Polley may be young in experience as a director and writer, but if the brilliant AWAY FROM HER is any indication of her talent, we are in for a series of significant films. Highly Recommended.

It was released in that pergatory period for movies (early to mid-August) and it was at the theater and then--poof--gone.  That's a real shame because I enjoyed the movie.  The original, which I did enjoy more than the reboot, went more for comedy than actual horror.  "Fright Night" was a long-in-the-tooth local production hosted by Peter Vincent, fearless vampire killer (*nudge/nudge, wink/wink*).Colin Farrell plays Jerry Dandridge in the redo.  His character is not comedic; heck, he's not even all that friendly.  He is evil and he's in town to do evil things.  Following the plot of the original, he moves into the house next to Charley (Anton Yelchin) and his mom--sans his "goon" from the first picture.  He has not come to this suburb of Las Vegas to make friends and give "warm-fuzzies" to people.  He has come to repopulate his kind and he wastes no time in doing so.  And he's on to Charley quicker than a duck on a June-bug.  The director (Craig Gillespie) didn't waste time on having a love story between Jerry and Charley's girlfriend, which I rather enjoyed.  Jerry saw her as simply another meal.I don't quite understand why this version was publicized as a "remake," because it was almost an entirely different story.  What worked in the first picture, wouldn't have necessarily worked in this one.  It was a different take and I enjoyed it.  Check it out.  The movie is rated R.  It has some gore (not much) and language, and that's about it.

 Every single character represented here is found in a typical office

 The only thing that is scary is; Which one am I????  Brilliant acting and character casting

$review_text.: I've been a vintage horror fan since I was a very young child and would stay up late every Friday and Saturday night having the likes of Lugosi, Karloff and Chaney enthrall me. I've read most books and seen most if not all documentaries on my late(fright)night heroes and revisiting this set I had to write a review on it. If you are a fan of the classic horror films of the masters, then this is a must buy for you.The two disc set is out of print now and fetching much more than it did a few years ago while in print(I found it under $10.00!), but it's worth seeking out for a decent price. It host five documentaries each on one of the following, Lugosi, Karloff, Chaney Jr., Peter Lorre and Vincent Price. These are from the A&E; Biography series and considering what they cost individually(about $20-$25 each), this set is a bargain.Besides the 45 minutes documentaries we are treated to multiple trailers for each star and rarely seen interviews with Lugosi, promo with Karloff and Lugosi and more featuring each star. If I have any gripe whatsoever, it is that Lon Chaney Sr. should have been included.The quality is excellent even on the trailers which are usually really battered. While no trailers are pristine, these range from generally worn and amazingly clear. The biographies are handled well and give a pretty good glimpse into these actors who ruled the horror genre then and are still the definitive versions of the monsters they played.

$REVIEW.: I had high hopes for this movie.Unfortunately, the CGI just wasn't up to it; it was almost good enough but not quite. And while I loved the bits that stuck true to the original - most of the beginning - the "plot twist" which took the movie away from the original epic poem was kind of depressing. If it were a normal movie taking place in Viking society with characters named other names and they ended it this way, that would be great; but once again someone had to go take a perfectly good classic and use the "brand name" to sell a story that bore only loose relation to the original tale.  See the most recent "King Arthur" for another one of these unnecessary alterations.

$review_text.: When i first saw season one appearing in shops in november 06, i was tempted to buy it to recall one of my fave shows growing up. But i decided not to, remembering that season one was terrible- melrose hadn't found it's feet and was too earnest back in season one. Then, when i saw season two, i picked it up, i loved watching the show all over again and seeing how it transformed itself from serious issue driven storylines to downright outrageous stories. I'm here in ireland and i have been waiting for season three since last november but still no sign, i bit the bullet and imported from US  recently and this has been highly addictive stuff. This is the Melrose i remember- it was so outrageous and enjoyable and watching now -it still is. Season three really is the start of melrose at it's consistent best. season 4 and 5 continue to match the standard set here. I just loved watching this season. sydney joining the cult, kimberly going nuts again!, Amanda's cancer fight, jo's baby drama, jane being fooled by the sleazy Chris, the introduction of the spoilt Brooke, alison falling of the wagon.Watching this reminds of how good this show was even though it was never cool to admit it. I watched three to four episodes every chance i could, it's so addictive.watching also made me think how modern US drama's are not a patch on the old ones. I mean Melrose moved at break neck speed, if u  missed an episode , u really had missed out, someone could have married and divorced in two weeks on this show. Look at Lost and desperate Housewives now, not a patch on this, they take themselves way too seriously when in fact they are very tiresome, i mean the amount of actual plot development in these shows per episode is ridiculous. An hour of Housewives for instance is padded with so called comedy routines with just a mere tease of plot development meeant to whet your appetite. The writers should look back to Melrose, it was so engaging, never a dull moment and the stories went enjoyably fast.Enjoy this pure treat of telly goodness

$REVIEW.: Two deliverymen get more than they bargained for when they are delivering crates to a horror shop, which crates contain the remains of the actual Frankenstein and Dracula monsters.  The proprietor is hoping to make some bucks with his exhibit.So on a dark and stormy night, Chic and Wilbur (Abbott and Costello) uncrate the fiends, but Wilbur is the only one who actually encounters them and the sight gags are very funny.Lugosi reprises his role as Dracula, many years after his last incarnation in the original 1931 film, Dracula.  Glenn Strange, no stranger to the Frankenstein's monster costume, is the monster.Lon Chaney, Jr. returns as the Wolfman, bent on stopping Dracula from reanimating the Frankenstein monster with the brain of Wilbur!  [If they had succeeded, wouldn't Frankenstein run around yelling "AAABAAAAT!"?  Oh well....]There are strong women in this play -- Sandra, the woman who actually only wants Wilbur for his brain and who recently left Europe for some questionable medical practices.  She is the patsy for Dracula.  And the insurance investigator Joan, who at first acts very able and intelligent, but after the party scene she does not play much of a role.The jokes are silly and funny.Larry:  When the moon rises, I turn into a Wolf!Wilbur:  Yeah, you and 20 million other guys!Or Chic and Wilbur discuss the blind dates they've had.Wilbur:  That girl I kissed had so much bridge work, I had to pay toll!And of course the physical humor with the pratfalls and gags is what makes A&C; A&C;!Universal Pictures did not worry about continuity and you shouldn't either.  It's a comedy after all.  Gothic castles in the Florida everglades?  Fully stocked labs?  And who's this professor guy?  And wasn't Larry Talbot cured of lycanthropy in The House of Dracula?Nice touch having Vincent Price as the voice of the Invisible Man, years before he would actually be known as a horror icon.Other A&C; Hits:The Best of Abbott & Costello, Vol. 3 (Abbott & Costello Go to Mars / Abbott & Costello in the Foreign Legion / Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein / Abbott & Costello Meet the Invisible Man / Abbott & Costello Meet the Killer / Comin' Round the Mountai...The Best of Abbott & Costello, Vol. 4 (Abbott & Costello Meet Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde / Abbott & Costello Meet the Keystone Cops / Abbott & Costello Meet the Mummy / Abbott & Costello Meet Jerry Seinfeld / Abbott & Costello Meet the Monsters / The World of...

$review_text.: First of all, if you like The Office, skip all reviews and watch immediately.  This is similar to The Office in many ways (particularly it's "mockumentary" style) and is even funnier, especially as the seasons progress (reverse for The Office).  It somehow gets better and better, and the characters are some of the most likable, unique, and funniest on television, some in television history.Amy Poehler plays Leslie Knope, a very ambitious and goofy government employee who this season is trying to get on City Council.  In the first season the character was criticized for acting too dumb (think like Michael Scott, a bit), so they made her a little less ditzy going into season 2 and she's been sharpened more and more since then.  Leslie is still incredibly goofy, but it's much more evident now how smart she is.  Unlike Michael Scott in The Office, Leslie is super hard-working and sleeps 3 and 1/2 hours on average a night because she spends all of her time working.  Like Michael Scott, she has a crazy sweet tooth.I love Poehler and her portrayal of Leslie because it is so refreshing to have a non-sexualized woman as a lead role on a television show.  Poehler is a very pretty woman, no doubt, but she doesn't rely on her looks at all for this show.  She dresses very conservatively and I don't think we see even a hint of cleavage.  She is a super empowering female character and a great role model.Ron Swanson, played by Nick Offerman, has a crazy cult following and has been dubbed by many critics as one of the funniest characters in television history, and the relationship between him and Leslie is compared a lot to that of Mary and Lou's from The Mary Tyler Moore Show.  In the first season Ron wasn't as prevalent, but now he has nearly iconic status.  Ron hates the government, so is constantly FOR cutting spending and hates to work.  He hates fancy technology and pop culture and spends most of his free time woodworking, eating steak, fishing, hunting, etc.  He's the All-American manly man, and Offerman is so skilled in deadpan comedy.  The actor and character are also quite similar, especially their affinity to woodworking.  If you check out Offerman's Twitter, he closed it because it was a "mistake" and wanted to go out in nature instead.  This just adds to the uniqueness that is Ron Swanson.  My boyfriend is 40 and Ron Swanson is now his "hero," lol.  He really is hilarious.Aziz Ansari plays Tom Haverford, who is obsessed with making lots of money and what's hot and what's not.  He also is amazingly great and weird at coming up with business names and ideas.  Chris Pratt and Aubrey Plaza as married couple Andy Dwyer and April Ludgate respectively is one of the best decisions the showrunners have made for character development.  They complement each other, are fun and cute to watch, and most of all - hilarious.  Andy is dumber than ever.This is definitely one of the best comedies on television right now.  Some of my other favorites are It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, The Office, Psych, Louie, Wilfred, The League, Veep, and yet - this consistently gets a lot more laughs out of me every time.  And the show gets better as it goes on - it is seriously in its prime right now.  It also has amazing replay value, because it's a lot of fun to go back and rewatch these characters that you didn't know as well at first.

$REVIEW.: It's kind of a literate comic book. Part Pimpernel, part 1984 and playing more French than English, V for V is likable enough but I wonder who exactly it's made for. It's a little talky for kids and tad lame for adults. Some curiously pointed comparisons with 9/11 can keep up the interest.Set design was obviously a big factor but the FX were a bit cheesy. Performances were uniformly fine and the direction even better. If they had made something more serious, I might not have bothered to see it but they (everyone involved) are capable of making something of a serious or maybe even comic nature that could be very good. The best thing I can say for V is that it won't put you to sleep and it was the best thing to come out this week.

$REVIEW.: I must say that I the only time I had seen Miss Lucille Ball in a TV sitcom before this was her beloved "I Love Lucy" (for which I've saw every single episode!) and a few episodes of "The Lucy Show". I wanted to order the first season of her third (of four) sitcoms, "Here's Lucy". My main reason for purchasing this was just to see how well Lucy worked with her real life kids, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. I was also very interesting in seeing what Miss Ball quit do "The Lucy Show" for and then decided to do. This series is very entertaining (more so than "The Lucy Show" in my opinion...) and it finished at a healthy No.9 in the 1968/69 Nielsen ratings. Not only does Lucy still shine in this "silly, goofy, innocent comedic gem", it has a bus-load of guest stars that appear in the very first season! They include: Jack Benny, Jackie Gleason, Eva Gabor, Carol Burnett, Wayne Newton (and band), and let's not forget Lucy's old play Vivian Vance back as "Viv Jones". I must also clear that Amazon.com has made a mistake claiming that this Complete 1st Season has no special features: it does! Besides from an interview with Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz, Jr. about doing the series, there are several other things as well, like Lucie and Desi, Jr.'s screen-tests for their mother's 1968 movie "Yours, Mine, and Ours" (with Henry Fonda).***So to round it up.... this is a very "enjoyable" series with silly little comical jokes like all of Miss Ball's sitcoms. Can't wait to order season two and three and four and five and six!

$review_text.: I did a comparison of the new Criterion Blu-ray transfer to the old Criterion DVD transfer (I don't have the old Image DVD to compare it to).One big improvement I see between the Blu-ray and the old DVD is that the image is much more steady on the Blu-ray presentation. There is more bounce to the picture in the old DVD.Near the beginning as the camera pulls up to the ticket window, look at the posted notice, it bounces around as if floating separate of the background on the old DVD, it is steady and seems attached to the background on the new Blu-ray.BUT there seems to be some fluctuation in the blacks in the new Blu-ray transfer that was not in the old DVD. This was a little annoying, why did it turn up now? Has the original film started to deteriorate since the last transfer?  This fluctuation, or flicker starts right at the beginning as the British Film Board Certificate fades in, and it remains in the picture, most of the time unnoticeable but other times it stands out.Even though the new transfer is still soft, the Blu-ray has no compression artifacting that was noticeable in the old DVD. I can not vouch for the new DVD.The bottom line: is it worth upgrading to Blu-ray?  I would say only "maybe". I was a little disappointed that it did not look sharper and that the blacks flickered.
$SUMMARY.: New Blu-ray transfer still soft, but steadier than the old DVD.

$REVIEW.: Unlike most other movies of this genre, I could actually identify with the the relationship between romantic leads Natalie Portman and Ashton Kushner.  The craziness and the intensity of their feelings and beliefs, regarding what a relationship (or non-relationship) should be, actually rang true to me.  People do crazy things when they are strongly attracted to one another--whether you are the person like Kushner who tries to frantically push the relationship forward, or the person like Portman who refuses to even consider the possibility that something special is happening.  Both parties, are, in point of fact, terrified that this thing will follow a different course than the one to which they are currently committed.For me, a very large and essential part of the appeal of this movie is that I could actually FEEL the intensity of the attraction between the characters played by Portman and Kushner!I was particularly taken by one scene in which Portman begins to realize how much she cares for Kushner.  As you would expect for someone who has strong emotions, her description of her feelings for Kushner are often incoherent.  I really loved it that she begin this outpouring of her feelings by exclaiming "He's so tall!"

$review_text.: actually had high hopes for this remake. It didn't take long of actually sitting in the theater for those hopes to be shot straight out of the sky. My main gripe is with the redesign of Freddie. He looks like Jim Carrey's Grinch That Stole Christmas. Nothing about his appearance was at all frightening. It looked far too plastic and fake. How do special effects from two decades ago look better than anything we can put together now? It is sad really. And they gave him way too many lines in the movie. Less is more when it comes to horror villains. Especially when you have such horrible dialogue as "Why are you screaming? I haven't even cut you yet." Freddy's one liners are enough to kill this movie on their own. In fact I could have forgiven the terrible acting from the other stars, the cheesy gore effects and the ridiculous story details the new movie added..... if only they hadn't turned the centerpiece of the series into such a joke.

$REVIEW.: Ngaio Marsh was one of the big three mystery writers who kicked off the genre for women writers in the 20th Century. She was a New Zealander who migrated to England around the time of WWII and who, along with Christie and Sayers, developed a version of the upper crust male protagonist dectective modeled on Sherlock Holmes.Sadly, few of Marsh's stories were dramatized for PBS Mystery Theater, though I a number of them have been turned into "talking" books.  I recall that there was some discussion at the time of the release of the PBS films about the suitability of Patrick Malahide for the part of Inspector Alleyn.  I don't know if that was a factor in PBS not showing more episodes or not, but I think Malahide was just fine.The first episodes of the Alleyn series cover his early days as an Inspector for Scotland Yard where he teams up with DI Fox (William Simons - Inspector Cribb) and meets his future wife, the artist Agatha Troy (Belinda Lang --To Serve Them All My Days). Troy is a suspect in a murder case Alleyn investigates involving a collection of artists one of whom is a victim of foul play.Marsh was involved with the world of art including the theater and many of her books reflect her extensive knowledge of stage craft. Comparable to Christie with her poisons, Marsh relied on her background knowledge to shape her cunning plots.Acorn can't get these mysteries released fast enough for me.  I have read all Marsh's books, but unfortunately far to few of them were dramatized and fewer still are available on DVD.

$REVIEW.: The maker here claims the LAPD's rogue cops, moonlighting as Death Row Records security, helped kill Tupac because he was demanding $10m from Suge Knight, who commanded his dirty cop friends to shoot Tupac and make it look like an East Coast/West Coast rap feud


Biggie had to be killed a few months later to maintain the fiction


It may well be true

However, nowhere do we see the LAPD responding, nor any responsible attorney or any legitimate media, such as the LA Times, which got into trouble over this case


Still, it's an enjoyable entertainment, even if the filmmaker's ethics and medthods and editing are questionable


It doesn't really answer who killed either rapper

Suge Knight's prison interview never mentions the killings.

$REVIEW.: This is the greatest transfer of the films I've seen in years.  I've grown up on this and Star Wars and i must say Lucas Film has taken a long time to bring these particular films into DVD, but I must say it was worth the wait.  The 5.1 surround sound is amazing and the picture is incredible compared to the old tapes I still have from the late eighties or early nineties. I know for some people the bars on the wide screen versions of most movies are annoying.  However this is a film I recommend purchasing in the particular format.  The bonus disc with this particular set is interesting as well.  you'll see Lucas', Spielberg's as well as other staff member's take on all three trilogies.  I'm not sure about the new set that just came out but if you can't get this one i recommend getting that one, unless Kingdom of the Crystal Skull comes out on DVD and maybe a four pack set comes out.  Or if you have BluRay then wait for that, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it on 1080p and PCM 5.1. But if your cheap like me then i recommend getting it on DVD, it is just as good on 480p and 5.1  Surround Sound.

$REVIEW.: The actual rank I give this film is 3.5 stars.If you have a chance to watch this movie and time is not rushing your way - do it. It can all be summed up to a harmless action 'flick' , that offers the viewer a couple of hours with the old Willis' McLain we all know all to well from the 'Diehard' trilogy . In addition to that , you find a kind of routine man plus kid getaway from the bad guys thriller , which is enriched with a secondary interesting (though superficial) dramatization of the autism's syndrome .The matching of Willis with the child works quite well . My hunch is that this role had turned Night Shyamalan's attention to Willis , this attention ended up in a collaboration that was concluded in Willis' biggest blockbuster to date . This point of view makes the film more interesting , because you get a chance to watch Willis making his first steps in an uncharted territory for him . Eventually this journey brought him also the role in 'Disney's the kid' and of course in 'Unbreakable' , so it's pretty nice to see another brick in his developing career .Aside from that , the movie is vastly flawed and has lots of holes in the script and plot . I recommend a good and through review of a Canadian writer , that wrote one of the first reviews about this movie and really pointed out  all the defects this product has , in a funny and humorous manner . Nevertheless , for an entertaining movie that doesn't take itself too seriously these are bearable defects you can live with . Sit down , take it easy , enter a somewhat fictitious reality and enjoy 'Mercury Rising' .

$review_text.: SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE****  Out of 5Release Date- November 12th, 2008Running Time- 121-MinutesRating- RScreenplay- Simon BeaufoyDirector- Danny BoyleStarring- Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Rubiana Ali, Tanay Chheda, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar, Madhur MittalSlumdog Millionaire took the film world by storm and won several Oscars, with major ones for best adapted screenplay, best director and the big one best picture. Slumdog Millionaire is the little movie that I'm sure not many expected to become the blockbuster hit it was and of course winning all the Oscars it did. There's a lot of hype on Slumdog and the good news is due to that people will see it; the downside is there's bound to be some backlash. What many people though are wondering does Slumdog Millionaire live up to all the hype? The answer is yes and no.Slumdog Millionaire is a great flick for sure and I would rate the movie as one of my favorites of 2008, but personally I don't think Slumdog is best picture good. I thought the movie was good enough, but there were some other movies I thought were a bit better and some weren't nominated, but despite that Slumdog Millionaire is a great flick and worthy of the praise, but don't get caught up too much with the hype because than you'll be bound to be disappointed. A lot of people have compared Slumdog Millionaire to Rocky due to the underdog vibe both movies have and that's where the strength of Slumdog comes from. Everybody loves an underdog story and I'm sure that in part is what helped Slumdog dominate the Oscars.The screenplay by Simon Beaufoy is very well written and the characters are rock solid; the main character is Jamal and we follow him through his life played by three different actors and I really liked the concept of that and I think that's what makes this movie so likeable to you follow the character around and see the tough life he has and it brings sympathy to him. Slumdog is sort of that movie that as you watch it you get more and more invested in the lives of these characters and any possible flaws you can find are more than made up for due to that.Danny Boyle has been a director who has had a nice following, but here with Slumdog Millionaire he's now a major player in Hollywood. Boyle does a great job with Slumdog and all the praise he's gotten for the movie is more than deserving; the pacing of Slumdog is excellent and the movie is always moving forward with the plot or characters. Boyle manages to grab the viewers' attention from the start and always keeps you invested in the life of Jamal and the other characters. Danny Boyle creates some truly deep and touching scenes and is able to really bring out a lot of different emotions while you watch the movie.The acting is solid from pretty much all the cast members and Dev Patel and Freida Pinto are both talents to watch for in the future. The character of Jamal played Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and then by Dev Patel is a truly great character that you can get behind and root for and all three actors are excellent.Slumdog Millionaire is a great movie, but what elevates the movie is how we follow Jamal through different times in his life and that's what will hook the viewer and make us so invested in his life and how it will all turn out. Again Slumdog Millionaire is worthy of the praise it has gotten and worthy of it's best picture win even if it wouldn't be my top pick, but I highly recommend this movie. It's destined to become a classic.

$REVIEW.: One of the first (if not THE first) major Hollywood films to be shot in and around the ruins of Europe after WW2, Jacques Tourneur's BERLIN EXPRESS (1948) is a fun ride for fans of film noir, with great starring roles for Robert Ryan, Merle Oberon and Paul Lukas.When a carrier pigeon is shot down over Paris, it's cryptic message is discovered by a group of children and forwarded on to the authorities.  Soon after, a group of disparate government workers from the United States, England, Germany, Paris, and the Soviet Union all board a train headed for Amsterdam, where noted German peace activist Dr. Bernhardt (Paul Lukas) is to give a speech.  After narrowly avoiding an explosion in his sleeper, Bernhardt later disappears once the party arrives at the station in Amsterdam.  Bernhardt's secretary Lucienne (Merle Oberon) must appeal to the combined efforts of the traveling companions in his recovery.An obvious attempt by producer Dore Schary to make a statement on the need for countries to band together after the tumult of WW2, BERLIN EXPRESS is a moody, noirish thriller, which makes good use of it's location filming (particulary the bombed buildings and underground cabarets of Amsterdam).  The script by Harold Medford (based on an original concept by Curt Siodmak) is well-rendered and the performances are fine.  Merle Oberon's shocking French accent aside, she's all you could possibly want as the heroine, and Robert Ryan matches her every step of the way.  Paul Lukas' performance as Bernhardt seems to dovetail his Academy Award-winning role in "Watch on the Rhine".Recommended.

$review_text.: I just finished listening to this performance of Mahler's 2nd Symphony and I can't wipe the smile off my face! Not only is the Blu-ray fidelity absolutely perfect, but the video quality and tastefully well-informed camera angles/close-ups are icing on the cake.The surround sound is glorious, faithfully reproducing the acoustics of the performance hall. The audio is crystal clear; I didn't miss a single note.The *only* thing I would have done differently would have been to emphasize the final movement's off-stage ensembles in the rear surround speakers to make full use of the technology (although some might argue that would be a "gimmick" that could distract the listener since it wouldn't represent how those off-stage ensembles actually sounded in the concert hall). But that's not a criticism of how the off-stage ensembles are heard in this recording; rather, it's just a personal preference I've always wanted to hear in a Mahler's 2nd recording. Oh, well :)Everything about this presentation is classy and in service to the music. And what music it is! I grew up with the Gilbert Kaplan recording with the London Symphony Orchestra, and have never found its equal. While I still prefer Kaplan's interpretation (and could only dream of his version being presented with the fidelity and dynamic range of this Blu-ray), Chailly's glorious performance on this disc is still breathtaking.Note that some consider Kaplan's version(s) to be too academic and not musical enough. But since his was my first Mahler 2nd, Kaplan's was the one imprinted on my brain for better or worse. Happily, Chailly's tempos are very close to Kaplan's, so listening to this recording was like visiting an old friend who got better with age.Regardless of whether you prefer Kaplan, Bernstein, Solti, Walter, Mehta, Klemperer, or someone else, this Blu-ray featuring Chailly and the Leipzig Gewandhaus will knock your socks off.If you like Mahler, get this Blu-ray. And that recommendation is coming from one of the pickiest, most opinionated, impossible-to-please perfectionists to ever troll Amazon.com's reviews!

$REVIEW.: Like the films that followed the original Star Wars, this is one of those rare moments that the sequel is just as good (or better) than the first. Whereas Superman I, there was little action but a lot of story, this had more action and a lot of story. Reeve again is superb as the Man of Steel, but this time he's faced with a dilemma of choosing between continuing as his superhero persona or giving it up for Lois. And after choosing a mortal life, he feels regret after seeing General Zod take over. Kidder is also excellent as Lane, also showing character depth. My favorite scene with the two is near the end, where she's telling him about how messed up her life is/will be now that she knows. Hackman is more of the co-villain and manipulates Zod and his cohorts into fighting Superman then tracking him down by coaxing the General's ego. The actors who play the villains (Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran) do it with menace and a very dry sense of humor. The effects are better than ever, especially during the fight in Metropolis and Ken Thorne does an admirable job of doing Williams' magnificent themes. What I don't like about this movie is Richard Lester. He inserts too many sight gags than are necessary for a superhero film (especially when the villains use their superbreath). And the flying scenes with Superman just feel flat (his cape moves more in the Fortress of Solitude than when he's flying at top speed to France). But if I had to pick which version of this film I prefer, it's this one. Not that Donner's version was bad. My main problem is the ending. Donner's is just a copout and the events that follow or that have preceded don't make sense. For instance, after spinning the earth backwards (again), the encounter with the bully is irrelevant (despite the fact that Superman remembers) and the destruction of the Fortress is redundant. The ending in this version makes more sense and the ending makes me feel very patriotic. Amazing that a movie about a fictional character can do that when our present government, especially the man in charge, can't. He just can't stir the feeling in me that I get when I see Superman fly the top of the White House back to the President.UPDATE (4 YEARS LATER) In preparation for Man of Steel (which I'll eventually review) I re-watched Superman 1 and both versions of 2. I've got to admit I still enjoy the Lester version. Granted I still despise the sight gags in the super breath sequence but it just is better in my opinion. There are things in the Donner version I liked, such as the scene in the hotel when Lois deduces Superman's identity, the fight in Metropolis and the removal of a lot of Lester's humor. Also the first missile that Superman diverts into space and releasing the villains instead of the hydrogen bomb I liked as that links both films better. The Brando scenes I really didn't enjoy and they dragged the pace of the film by having him repeat a lot of the same dialog (such as the first film scenes in the beginning with him talking about the villains and then repeating the same thing in the Fortress of Solitude). The scenes with Susannah York were better since it builds a more emotional connection by understanding that Clark would want to fall in love. The green crystal deus ex machine is also set up better in Lester's version by having Superman show and explain it to Lois, who then drops it when she and Superman eat dinner and he later finds it when he returns. The Donner version just has it show up out of nowhere. Right before the fight starts, I prefer the line "Would you care to step outside?" over "Haven't you ever heard of freedom of the press?". I like how Ken Thorne builds the theme music when Superman begins to crush Zod's hand. It's an awesome moment (I'd like to think audiences cheered back in 80/81 when this happened) versus reusing John Williams' work from the first film. The ending is still pointless, making the hour and forty minutes you just spent watching this entirely pointless. I don't care if it was the original ending that Donner had in mind, I don't care if he had continued on as director that he would've changed it, it doesn't change the fact that the entire movie is now pointless. Leaving the deleted scene of the Arctic police arresting Zod and the others out of the equation, in the Lester version, the villains are dead. In the Donner version, they still live due to time being reversed. Yes they are still imprisoned but what's to stop some anomaly in space from setting them free and they take over other planets, build an empire and head to Earth. If Superman remembers everything after he's reversed time, who's to say the villains don't? Granted the super-kiss of forgetfulness doesn't make any sense either but it doesn't render the whole film pointless. Overall, the Lester version gets 5 stars, Donner's 4.

$REVIEW.: I recently watched my copy of Jerry Maguire again, perhaps for the tenth time. It's one of those that seems to find its way into my DVD player every three or four months.The thing is, this movie just keeps better with  each viewing. Crowe's direction keeps the movie proceeding in a sharp and  even flow--mixing Cruise's relationships with Zellweger and Gooding (who  turns in an incredibly fine and funny performance) with enough quickness to  keep the movie interesting for fans of sports and romance alike.It may  have been &quot;just a mission statement&quot;, but Jerry Maguire's  struggle to improve personal and professional relationships make this  endearing dramedy a modern classic, worthy of the accolades it received  upon its release in theatres and since.

$review_text.: The Naked Gun - From the Files of Police Squad!~ Leslie Nielsen is the first and best movie in the series. Leslie Nielsen is amazing in his role as Frank Drebin. The script is very well written and the jokes are totally hillarious. It is kind of strange and unsettling to see OJ Simpson a movie but at the time he was not loaded with the stigma that he is today. The music is amazing and the dialogue is crisp. I love the opening sequence with the police car going all over the place. It is a total spoof of the sometimes overly pretentious cop movies that seem to take themselves so seriously. This is an amazing movie that should not be missed and there are several funny scenes like the one with the old chinese food in his fridge, the office scene with the fish and the pen, the scene in the bathroom with the mike on and the hosptial scene to mention a few. Higly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I really wanted to like this movie because the corruption of the police department regarding rampart was a huge story in the city I lived in, but unfortunately, the movie was on the dull side. I get the sense that they stuck to the events pretty closely and Woody Harrelson did a decent job with the role but I found my interests wavering. The movie had a gritty feel and Harrelson is a complex character in that he is passionate about staying on the force even though he can retire with full benefits. As a cop, he does have his own ideals of what&#8217;s right and wrong, but you get the sense that he became jaded with time. He shoots before he asks questions, takes illegal drugs from heists, plants guns on dead people. He&#8217;s also an alcoholic, pops way too many pills, and makes everyone in his life miserable. The problem with anti-hero&#8217;s is that there should be a facet for the watcher to care for him or see how he went on this wrong road, but this didn&#8217;t happen in this movie. Everyone in the movie is after their own selfish ends and even the misguided girlfriend of David (Woody) doesn&#8217;t make sense. Why is a successful lawyer, that&#8217;s beautiful, and seemingly put together dealing with this scummy cop? His family kicks him out, the other cops on the force don&#8217;t like him and he doesn&#8217;t seem to care much about it. There&#8217;s a connection to some other dirty cops that is protecting him but even they have to cut him loose. Overall, it was watchable but I just didn&#8217;t find anyway to connect.

$review_text.: Hack Sign: Volume 6: Terminus contains the last three episodes of the fascinating cyber conspiracy-mystery anime series, plus two unrelated episodes.  Many questions raised during the series were not answered to my satisfaction.  Endings just happened too quickly.  What should have been a well thought-out conclusion became smarmy - almost Disneyfied - in its lame preaching about love and friendship.The extras are lame as well.  We have two unrelated episodes, one that tells us about Mimiru's mentor in the world, a mysterious, seemingly all-powerful female warrior.  She has a crush on a college guy playing in the world.  There are hints it could have been . . . Bear?The other extra episode is of clips of the series.  I watched it, hoping it would answer some of my questions, but alas, I feel I have been logged off of the World before I was ready.

$REVIEW.: Every once in awhile, movie fans need to watch a great "what if?" movie to really get them thinking about extraordinary possibilities

 "K-Pax" is exactly that type of movie.For a basic plot summary, "K-Pax" sees Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appear in a train station with seemingly no explanation of how or why
 According to Prot himself, he is an extraterrestrial from the planet K-Pax hear to "observe and report" on Earth culture

 Predictably, Prot is placed in a mental institution where Dr


Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) begins to unravel the mystery behind the strange (yet oddly inspiring) Prot.This is a great mystery/drama that will keep you engaged from beginning to end
 Director Iain Softley gives the film great pacing and fills it with equal parts human drama, mystery, science fiction, and humor

 If you have a single curious bone in your body, you'll quickly get sucked into the quirky Prot character and just how the heck we might be!A quick fair warning though: this is not necessarily the type of movie where all the "answers" are wrapped up in a nice bow for you at the end

 It requires a lot of thought and introspection to truly figure out for yourself what you feel the "answer" truly is

 I usually dislike those kind of conclusions, but here the subject matter becomes so compelling and fantastic that it makes sense of different interpretations of the preceding events to creep in.Overall, "K-Pax" is a great film for the intellectually curious or those who just love a great human drama mystery


 Only those with a very limited imagination will completely dismiss it.

$review_text.: Loved it.  It's really nice to see well balanced people that love, appreciate, and enjoy their craziness with each other.  I think the most striking thing about these little episodes (having spent most of my life in schools, counselling and psychology) is how openly affectionate this family is with each other without ever crossing the "ugh" line.  It is encouraging.  I once heard that there are basically two reasons that people watch a TV show: 1.) They'd like to hang out with the people in the show.  2.)  They become emotionally attached to one or more of the characters and want to see what happens next.  This has both.  This is also one of the rare shows that both my boyfriend and I have watched over and over.  That's why we bought the box set: Great packaging by the way!  Love it.  Thanks.

$REVIEW.: This is a program that I saw on Public Television back in the early 70's.When I found out this was on DVD I couldn't wait to see it again


I have to say I was a bit dissapointed to notice that some scenes were altered from the original broadcast
Call me a purist, but I love to see things the way they were originaly broadcast.This program originally had nudity, in particular Valerie Perrine's shower scene

In the original you can see her breasts, in this version you do not

There is a black bar that appeares on the bottom of the screen during the front shot of the shower scene, blocking out the nudity.(There is also another scene with her that is cut)Now this is not that big a deal as far as the story goes, you can still enjoy the play, and it is a good one
I gave this 3 stars because of the censorship on the DVD version

What made this controversial as far as television was concerned at the time was the language and nudity.It seems that nowadays just because it's on DVD does not mean it's complete.

$review_text.: This movie sounded stupid when I first heard about it
Who could make a 2 hour movie based on stripping at a club and have it make sense? Obviously, Ice Cube could
This movie stars LisaRaye in her film debut as Diana, who is known to the stripping world as Diamond, a hardworking college student who needs a better way to pay to get herself through school
While working at a shoe store, she meets Trixie (Adele Givens) and Ronnie (Chrystale Wilson)

They convince her into quitting her low-paying job and working at The Player's Club, a run down joint owned by a lowlife loser named Dollar Bill (Bernie Mac)

When Diana's cousin Ebony (Monica Calhoun) comes into town, she tells Diana that she wants to work at the player's club
Ebony gets caught up in this world and is drowning in the lows of "using what you've got to get what you want"


This movie is a thrill ride and the fight scene towards the end is the best part of the movie


Featured in the movie are Jamix Foxx, A.J

Johnson, and John Amos
The plot is perfect and the script is well written

This movie has to be one of my favorite.

$review_text.: It is rather surprising at the number of reviewers who detest "Burn After Reading," an obviously sizzlin' satire. What do they expect from the Coen Brothers? Why, this film could even be called a madcap comedy with a criminal twist."Burn After Reading" has been "read" a number of ways: a spoof of the intelligence community (my call on the funniest part of the film), a social commentary on extra-marital and internet affairs, and a poke at mid-life crises. Let me add one more dimension to this adept Coen Brothers film of masterful ensemble acting: the apparent inability for one human to really know another, resulting in superficial intimacies.People are who they are. Even if they switch their partners, they still are who they are. Case in point: Tilda Swindon plays a cold, haughty type with John Malkovich, but once she and George Clooney actually shack up, they become who they are once again and disenchanted with each other.Clooney enjoys sex with Francis McDormand's character until he learns she is part of his paranoid misadventure. She is willing to sell trade secrets to the Russian Embassy to make enough money for plastic surgery. Her employer at the health club is obviously in love with her and is willing to overlook her suddenly bad work habits. Brad Pitt perfectly plays an airhead personal trainer, yet is fearless in espionage matters. John Malkovich is fired from Intelligence and writes his memoirs in a drunken stupor to get back at the agency. In fact, it is Malkovich's papers that get into the hands of Francis! It is a big loop-di-loop. Even though I gave important parts of the story above, none is a spoiler!Even Clooney's wife, a children's book author for pete's sake, is having an affair. Do we really know another human being, even those we love and live with? The Coens say no. All these people are solid citizens, yet behave abominably when their little universes fall apart.One reviewer describes Francis McDormand as the third Coen Brother. Considering that Francis gets what she wants at the end, his statement is verified and justified! But consider again, does she really win?

$REVIEW.: Released 8 months after Patrick Swayze's death, this new Limited Keepsake Edition is the overall best release, especially for a fan like me. To start with, the twenty-five page Keepsake Book was beautifully filled with pictures, quotes, bios of the actors, a pop quiz, lyrics to the Kellerman's Anthem, and a forward from writer and co-producer Eleanor Bergstein. More pictures are featured on the case when you open to find the two discs. The opening menu takes you back to the movie before you ever hit play.On Disc 1 are the basic features such as Set Up, Scene Selections, and Special Features, but while the second disc has more don't think these special features aren't worth watching or the commentaries aren't worth listening to because they are. You can watch the movie with or without the commentary, but there are two different commentaries and both are great to listen to. You can also watch the movie with the trivia track that has interesting tidbits about the movie that pop onto the screen as you watch the movie. The special features are interesting, especially finding out more details about how they made the film in Kellerman's: Reliving the Locations of the Film. The Rhythm of Dancing is a documentary with Patrick Swayze that he did before his death. Dirty Dancing: The Phenomenon is more about how one movie became one of the biggest movies of all time.On Disc 2 it features so many extras that you'll spend hours going through every feature from the Dance Sequences to the Tributes, which made me cry. When you hit In Memoriam it features a lovely montage remembering Jerry Orbach, Jack Weston, Max Cantor, Emile Ardolino, and of course Patrick Swayze. They feature three separate tributes to Jerry Orbach (narrated by Kelly Bishop). A tribute to Patrick Swayze as told by brother Donny Swayze, wife Lisa Niemi, Eleanor Bergstein, Kenny Ortega, and Miranda Garrison. A tribute to Emile Ardolino as told by Eleanor Bergstein, Miranda Garrison, Kenny Ortega, with Jennifer Grey, and Luis Rodriguez. Another feature Dirty Dancing with Patrick Swayze is a must see documentary Patrick Swayze did before his death. Three music videos are featured on this disc: I've Had The Time of My Life, Hungry Eyes, and She's Like The Wind which are definitely take you back to 1987. There is also some funny outtakes and much much more!I can't say enough about this release; it is truly the best gift for a Dirty Dancing fan!!

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this movie, even though it is not your typical comedy.  Much of the humor is peculiar and off the wall.  Actually, "The Cable Guy" is more of a black-comedy, with several serious themes.  The storyline apparently isn't for everyone, judging by the mostly negative reviews it got from the professional movie critics.  Jim Carrey is amazing as the hyperactive, overly aggressive "Cable Guy", and Matt Broderick does a good job portraying the harassed victim.

$review_text.: Laides and Gentalmen, The Motherload has arrived! I have waited a long time to see Sailor Moon uncut, and this DVD has fufilled nearly all my expectations.  Before I begin with the content a quick discussion of the technical aspects of this dvd.  It's sound and picture quality are top notch. If you have only seen these episodes on tv you must see this dvd, it looks far better than the cartoon networks display.  This is however a barebones dvd.  You get a textless opening with kareoque sing along option, and little else.  The dvd has both original japanse and english audio tracs with english subtitles.  The good news is the japanse trac is the original dialougue, completely uncensored.  The bad news is the english dub is ridideled with a sickening amount of censoring.  For laughs leave the english on and put on the subtitles, then watch the final episode on this dvd, and you will see how utterly terrible the dub job that appears on American TV is.  At the end of it all I could say was " Silly Americans", and this is coming from an American.Now that that's out of the way, if you are a sailor moon fan this is definetly the thing to buy.  I personlay feel the S season is the best of the seasons seconded by the first season. So much happens in this season.  We have new soldiers, new attacks, much more character development, and even more amazing monsters.  As an added bonus we get the original openning and closing of the episodes, and even the episodes previews ala Cowboy Bebop.  The only reason this dosent get 5 stars are because of the lack of extras and the dubbing.  I can't say enough good things about this series.  Lets hope that American TV lightens up and realizes that people don't need to be shielded from things like homosexuality and differing cultures, mabey then we will all be able to enjoy sailor moon without having to learn japanese.

$REVIEW.: It's astonishing to see Peter Sellers, arguably one of the best actors of all time, working so gamely with the Muppets. Like the chameleon that he is, Sellers throws himself into each sketch that he performs, be it as Boris the beleaguered gypsy musician, a Strangelove-esque masseuse who leaves Link Hogthrob tied up in knots, or even as himself, whispering quietly to Kermit that he has had the real himself surgically removed, then playing a pair of tuned chickens under his armpits while reciting the "winter of discontent" speech from Richard III. Positively fascinating.Cleese, too, is a scream, especially as a sea pirate who has lost his way on "Pigs In Space."Moore's show is apparently trying to send a message that was crucial at the time, but those not in on the joke are not going to get it as well. It's fun to watch Dudley at odds with Animal, though.And in "Muppet Extras," be sure to click on "Movie Mania," for a [take-off] of "The Godfather" that is a sight to behold.

Characters came and went and possessed no depth whatsoever - not even the main character (and writer/producer), played by Neve Campbell.If I were rating this purely on the ballet scenes, it would have to be a five. But this is a movie, not a ballet, and it needed a story. I'm at a loss to discuss the film any further, and am surprised that others found more words to use than I have.

$REVIEW.: Too much has already been written about the film and the found footage restoration so let me just add some general observations (based on the 2010 Blu ray release):--This is hardly the definitive "restoration"
 Methods exist for cleaning up those scratchy found scenes to perfection, It's already been done on many other films including the Beatle's "Help!", so we know it's possible


 When the money is available, this film will be fully realized;--I consider it an error of aesthetical judgement not to have used the original text font for the "missing" scene descriptions, but it doesn't detract from enjoying the film;--The included orchestral track is magnificent, don't believe for a minute that you won't enjoy it without purchasing the "Alloy Orchestra" version.

$REVIEW.: Based on the most famous private detective, or possibly, the most famous fictional character in the world, Guy Ritchie's "Sherlock Holmes" looks like Gorge Roy Hill's buddy-buddy movies, or more recently, Walter Hill's "48 Hrs." Action-paced, breakneck adventures with a health amount of humor, "Sherlock Holmes" may not be the most faithful adaptation to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's source material, but it is a hugely entertaining action thriller.Set in late Victorian London, the fast-paced story follows the adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his recently engaged sidekick Dr. Watson (Jude Law). They have to stop the diabolical plot of mysterious Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), who seeks to change the course of the world forever.In "Sherlock Holmes" (2009) the world's greatest sleuth and his partner look much younger than in other versions. The Holmes of Robert Downey Jr. is not exactly the same as elegant Jeremy Brett's. They are both smart and witty, but the newer one looks more like a James Bond or Philip Marlowe with a messy hair, always ready to fight with his fists. Jude Law's Watson is more resourceful than the original. The pair is really fun to watch.Three female characters appear: Mrs. Hudson (Geraldine James), Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly), Watson's fianc&eacute;e, and Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), the only woman who ever has touched Holmes' heart. Sadly the first two characters have little to do in Guy Ritchie's new adaptation. Rachel McAdams fares a little better as wily Irene Adler, but still it seems as if the director is not really interested her character.The film's crew includes famous names: photography by Philippe Rousselot ("A River Runs Through it"); costume design by Jenny Beavan ("A Room with a View"); production design by Sarah Greenwood ("Pride & Prejudice"); and set decoration by Katie Spencer ("Pride & Prejudice"). Hans Zimmer's unique music, slightly overused, is still impressive."Sherlock Holmes" is a rip-roaring action adventure film. Maybe not exactly Conan Doyle had envisioned, but still very enjoyable nonetheless.

$REVIEW.: Overall, this is a well-done movie, with the exception of Mickey Rooney.My problem is not in the adaptation of the Truman Capote novella--it IS a very different story than what's being told here.  Could you film a version that's closer to Capote's story?  Of course.  But this film works as a stand-alone piece.My problem is:  how old exactly is Holly supposed to be?  Audrey Hepburn was 31 when she made this movie, and while she's absolutely enchanting in it, SHE LOOKS 31.  But when Buddy Ebsen shows up, he tells George Peppard that Holly was just shy of 14 when they married, and that his first wife died on the 4th of July, 1955.  Since the movie is set in 1961, that would make Holly (at most) all of 20 years old.

$REVIEW.: Despite being a fun and sexy romp, Mr. and Mrs. Smith will probably go down in history as the film that made Brad Pitt go from Jennifer Aniston to Angelina Jolie. Like a lot of films, the press behind it seemed to interest more people than the actual film itself, although it did a good number at the box office. While it's a bit problematic, this film wasn't designed to get your kleenex going or your mind working; it just wants to have fun and fun it has. This is the unrated edition so there's more stuff put in (or in some cases, taken out) but by and large, it's still the same rollickingly fun movie.While in Columbia, John and Jane meet and soon a relationship blossoms and they get married. But despite being insanely attractive, they don't really get along but seeing as how they're both hired assassins for separate agencies with none the wiser about the other's "real" profession, it's a good thing. But soon they find out and want to kill each other until there's a hit put out on the 2 of them so they have to team up and survive together and maybe even fall in love, and for real this time.Whether the meeting of the co-stars did result in the breakup of a marriage, you have to admit these 2 have huge time chemistry on-screen; so much so that the idea that their sex life is on the fritz seems almost laughable. It's also good that their acting is up to snuff and while they don't feel like completely realized characters, they more than pull it off. There's also some roles by always likable Adam Brody and scene-stealer Vince Vaughn.The action scenes are the highlight although they're none too inventive (although, the use of the dual sliding doors on SUV's was funny) but that's what we came to see: people getting shot at in MTV-style moves. My one complaint is that certain plot elements seem dropped, like the writer didn't want to write TOO much for the movie so he just wrote the bare minimum, even if certain things don't even get explained. But then again, this is a movie meant to be a blockbuster "good times had by all" kind of movie so it's kind of hard to complain when that was the point, no?It might not be the best action movie of that year or any year but if you ever pick it up, you might just enjoy yourself which is the whole point.

$REVIEW.: Let's get the important part out of the way right off the bat: the car Li is driving is a Dutch import called the SPYKER and the base price on it is a whopping $260,000. Yes, folks, I said "base price". If you want all the bells and whistles it will run you a cool $300,000.Now on to the movie....Was very hesitant about buying this one. Not because of Statham, but because of Li. I'd gotten the Chan/Li movie and was very disappointed in the collaboration. Now we have the action heroes of Statham and Li...Good combination. The storyline holds up, the action is great, the cars are to die for, and the confusion about what the heck is going on is constant.  Basic plot: two good guys, one is killed by the psycho ROGUE. The good guy left (Statham) is all-consumed with the need to hunt him down, even tho it costs him his marriage and normal life. Meanwhile, bad guy Rogue (Li) is playing Chinese Mafia warlords against one another to the point where no one knows why or where he is headed in this. When the light finally dawns (close to the end) it will be a shocker. For those who claim they guessed somewhere in the middle, don't believe it.I liked it. I liked the supporting cast, which was very good. (Kudos to the casting director) This little gem will keep your attention for the full run of the movie.  Buy, rent, borrow, whateverBy the way, Stathams' car was pretty darn awesome, too!

$review_text.: Simon Boccanegra is a dark drama of low male voices with only a few rays of lighter tenor and soprano. It originated in 1857 and was substantially revised in 1881. The music is profound and deep. But it can be jarring as it swirls along with mature Verdi artistry and suddenly there is a passage from the 1850s. What a difference! It is still a favorite and I have followed it for more than sixty years. My first Simon was Leonard Warren and Leo Nucci is the latest. I've heard some great performances e.g. Vladimir Chernov with the Met in 1995(with the greatest Fiesco of all time and time to come - Robert Lloyd).  I've also heard some pretty bad ones. But even in those there is something to be gained just from listening to Verdi's extraordinary music. Yes you can hear the waves and smell the Ligurian Sea or define what the characters are thinking in that extraordinary music.As an overall effort I think this present disc is an excellent production. The singing on the whole is absolutely top rate. The amazing Leo Nucci has done it again. From his first run-in with Fiesco in the prologue to his final gasp at the end of Act 3 he is the center of attention. His voice is still respondant to the demands of the drama. Another great job of singing was that of Simone Piazzola as Paolo. His big resonant voice has graced several recordings as of late and he gets better and better; he even acted well in this one. The Amelia/Maria of Tomar Iveri was almost ideal. She looked the part of a noble waif of elegant demeanor and she has a big, lush, well rounded voice that can float a note when needed or fill an auditoriun whe aroused. Another one that looked the part was Francesco Meli He has a nice, well controlled, pleasing tenor voice and he is young and handsome. So many singers that try this part a barrel-chested, badly overweight, past prime has beens (remind you of anyone?). Another excellent deep voiced basso, beautiful to listen to, was that of Robert Scandiuzzi. What a pleasure to revel in that beautiful sound. I only he could learn to act.The costumes were beautiful. The sets initially were interesting; certainly better than the Wiener Staatsoper's bare scaffolding and nothingness in their 2002 release with Thomas Hampson. But I'm old fashioned; from the '40s to the '90s when you went to the opera there was something magical in being transported back in time and place to the setting as the composer visualized it. The grand hall of the council chamber was a replica of that hall in the time of the 14th century when the drama took place in the recording done in 1995 Met production under James Levine with Chernov and R. Lloyd. Wow! It was great. There is no magic in a raked slab on stage and a meaningles pile of painted boxes. Eurotrash!n.b As Simon Boccanegra is based on an historical incident, some years ago I went to Genoa to see If I could find any places of the settings. I could find no trace of the Boccanegra palace but I did find a bronze plaque indicating the place of the Fieschi. It is now aprking lot for a department store. The local museum has reconstructed the Grand Council Chamber and it's paintings. Beautiful!

$REVIEW.: I must say that this DVD set is a great buy for any &quot;All In The Family&quot; fan.  I never really watched the show until last year and now I never miss it.  It's absolutely hilarious.  Carroll O'Connor was (in my humble opinion) a comic genius in his own right.For the record, two pilot episodes were created for &quot;All In The Family&quot;.  The first pilot from 1968 was entitled &quot;And Justice For All&quot; which was rejected by ABC.  This pilot episode is considered LOST, therefore it is understandable why it is not on the set.However, in 1971 creator Norman Lear created a 2nd pilot for the show which was originally titled &quot;Those Were The Days&quot; which was produced in 1969.  Up until the early '90s, this pilot episode was lost, and apparently now is aired on TV Land.What I don't understand is why they couldn't include this pilot episode on the set.  It makes no sense to me.  This reason, and this reason only is why I will not purchase the set.  Nowadays with television series' being released on DVD, 9 times out of 10, the pilot IS included.  So the &quot;All In The Family&quot; set will always feel somewhat incomplete as far as I'm concerned.But still, if you're a fan of the show, you really can't go wrong, as long as you're willing to forgive this little misconception on the part of Columbia/Tri Star home video.

$REVIEW.: Master and Commander is a pretty good movie about naval warfare and tall ships in the early 19th century.  Russell Crowe plays Captian "Lucky Jack" of the British ship Surprise. The mission is to destroy the French vessel Acheron, under Napoleon's reign. In this quest, we are shown what it was like to sail tall ships and what warfare was like in the 1800s.I haven't read Patrick O'Brien's novels, but I love the romance and excitement of seafaring adventure.  Like-minded individuals won't be disappointed, although the movie may be a bit less rough sailing than expected. The trailer to the movie shows the Surprise in the thick of battle and during very rough seas, but we needn't ask ourselves "what happened when the sea was at a dead calm?" We see that as well.This movie will thrill history buffs, too, because we get to see how things were done, what it was like to sustain injury and be treated, and the daily life of being  a sailor in her majesty's royal navy.  It was a brutal way of life and that's evident in the movie, especially when you consider that the British Navy was superior to all others in the 19th century, so it's probably safe to assume that their ships and practices were the highest standard of the time.There are many surprises in this movie-the remarkable youth of some of the sailors, how certain nautical methods and terms came to be, tactical techniques, and a very pleasant but abbreviated visit to the Galapagos Islands. But what I found most surprising was the moral slant of this movie. First of all, Captain "Lucky Jack" is the most benevolent of captains, a dedicated but fair and compassionate man.  There are several scenes where the captain has cause to give his men moral direction and guidance. He is deeply moved upon the tragic and sacrificial death of one of his sailors.  He asks his friend and co-star Paul Bettany, who plays the ship's doctor, "have the men indicated to you how they are feeling?" Would a Navy captain react that way, especially in the 19th century, with such humanity and concern for his men's emotional state?  I mean, isn't death, suffering, and loss a foregone conclusion in battle? These scenes felt to me more like a bit of modernizing than historical accuracy, but what do I know? I've never been in the navy.  The story itself is tightly focused; notice how the object of the movie is to overtake the Achelon and yet we never see what goes on with that French vessel. The story is about the men of the Surprise, and that's where our focus is kept.Another very pleasant surprise for this music lover is Ralph Vaughan Williams "Tallis Fantasia," used to great emotional effect in several key scenes.In all, Master and Commander is definitely worth full price, if for no other reason than to see the sea at her wildest on the big screen.  These scenes will make you lean forward in your seat, secure and thankful that it isn't *you* on the ship's deck or hanging from sail ropes.  The movie felt more like an ensemble movie; if there's a star here, it's the story itself.  You won't get the emotional impact of "A Beautiful Mind" and it won't stick to your ribs the way that masterpiece did, but it's still a pretty good movie. If this type of movie is your idea of a good time, don't wait for the video to come out. Get the full experience. See it now.

$REVIEW.: "The Late Shift" is based on Bill Carter's book, a blow-by-blow account of the back-stabbing battle for NBC's "The Tonight Show" that was waged in board rooms and over power lunches on two coasts 1990-1993. CBS approached Jay Leno (Daniel Roebuck) while he was "The Tonight Show"'s guest host, hoping to lure him to a competing late night talk show. But Leno's agent Helen Kushnick (Kathy Bates) preferred that Leno seek a deal with NBC that would guarantee him the job when Johnny Carson (Rich Little) retired. David Letterman's (John Michael Higgins) "Late Night" had been a hit for NBC for a decade, and Letterman expected to succeed Carson himself. With a waffling NBC trying to retain both comedians, CBS courting Letterman with a favorable deal, and Kushnick using any means necessary to hang onto "The Tonight Show", this comic drama went on for three years."The Late Shift" peeks behind the curtain at some of network television's big personalities, their ambitions, tactics, and professional dilemmas. It's largely true, as far as I can judge from articles I read about the saga at the time. Leno and Letterman are represented sympathetically. David Letterman comes off as an obsessive neurotic who tends to be glum -but less so than he does on his show. Leno seems like a nave guy who doesn't want anyone to get hurt. Letterman and producer Peter Lassally (Steven Gibson) half-jokingly compare CAA agent Michael Ovitz (Treat Williams) to The Godfather. Helen Kushnick's weapon of choice seems to be extortion. She sued Bill Carter but is now deceased. It's funny to watch NBC's John Agoglia (Reni Santoni) and Warren Littlefield (Bob Baleban) go around in circles over the same issue for years. The DVD (HBO 2005) offers subtitles in English, Spanish, French and dubbing in Spanish.
$SUMMARY.: Funny, Revealing Look at the Late Night TV Wars.

$review_text.: This is the best we have seen NOSFERATU yet

Beautiful restoration, something like the original Hans Erdmann score--if cut-and-pasted and mixed with familiar classical themes (a little distracting), the most complete print, and more frame information than before (in most places)
Yet it's still not as "ultimate" as it could be.First of all, it is not, as expected, a direct PAL-to-NTSC conversion of the UK Eureka "Masters of Cinema" version--both a good thing (very little digital artifacting unlike some other Kino releases) and a less good one as it turns out


Kino has obviously reprocessed it, and not always for the better
On the plus side, for whatever reason, the Kino version is a bit sharper than the Eureka

On the minus side: [1] The basic tint shade of the original restoration, as seen on the Eureka PAL disc, is a yellowish sepia with noticeable warm orange in it; Kino's basic shade is much yellower, sometimes annoyingly glary


[2] The original German restoration on the Eureka PAL disc has considerably more edge information on all four sides than all earlier versions
Kino generally has more than earlier versions too, but compared with the Eureka release, the top and bottom have a sliver less info and noticeably less on the sides


What would have been so bad about window-boxing the film so we could finally see the whole frame as intended?Kino has done something very odd: they give us the film twice--once on the main disc with newly created English inter-titles, and alone on a second disc with the original German inter-titles and optional English subtitles

Since the second disc is the more accurate way to do it--and the only way in the Eureka set, why bother with the translated-title-card version--especially when the font doesn't match the original very well? There didn't need to be any more than one disc: the original German inter-titles are far preferable and do have optional English subs.The documentary--originally in German--is nice, but the new Amerian narrator misprounces some things repeatedly

The Eureka edition has a commentary track; Kino does not

Kino, instead, ports over the same old extras from its 2002 DVD


Come to think of it, given that the Eureka set only has the German inter-titled version with optional English subs and the documentary (as well as a 3-minute "how we did it" feature common to both), neither it nor the Kino needed to be 2-disc sets! These are best versions so far, as I said, but some questionable decisions make another one probable--and sad to say, perhaps desirable--down the road, at least in the US

Maybe that was the idea: keep the buyer coming back to spend for yet another "new improved" version.

Partisans leave him in camp when they leave to fight the Germans.  Camp is destroyed by Germans you don&#8217;t really even see.  Boy hooks up with pretty girl.  Boy goes crazy before, and more so after, his family is killed by Germans.  Germans and Romanians torch village.  Boy is spared - somehow.  Boy sees partisans kill surrendering Germans and Romanians after a mostly un-scene battle.  Boy is still crazy.  Movie ends. Unbelievable scenes and too little battle action.  If there was some other thought to leave the viewer with other than you can go crazy when someone kills your family - I didn&#8217;t get it.

 When Phoebe is further terrorized, Meeks is the prime suspect

Phoebe has the support of her new boyfriend Duncan Swift (Ivan Sergei), her friend detective Liz Alberta (Olivia Cheng) and that of her captain, David McVee (Brian Markinson), so Meeks is dismissed
But someone (Meeks?) is out to really make Phoebe's life difficult, even to the extent of threatening her ex-husband
The film gets its title from the fact that her stalker walks past Phoebe's house at night whistling the theme of the classic Western `High Noon'

Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker are a separated New York City couple who witness a crime and , gasp, are put into the witness protection program in Wyoming. Sarah Jessica Parker is replaying Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City but instead of her signature Manolo Blahnik shoes, she is now a member of PETA.I am not a Parker fan and have never been impressed by her acting abilities. Hugh Grant plays his typical British self. However, I liked him better in this role and think someone else should have filled the shoes of Parker. The two really didnt seem to have good chemistry and the comedic timing was offbeat.

 McQueen really showed different facets again! He walked off of the set and it took The two James' (Coburn and Garner) to talk him back on


 I am glad they did because no one can do Steve McQueen BUT Steve McQueen


 The world is really missing something with him not in it!It was amazing to see how they ALL worked together to make this succeed


 This movie did not bog down and make it depressing


The action started right away and it never stopped


 Some WWII movies I remember as a child just dragging on and this one did NOT.They were wondering what the Steve McQueen, James Garner and other soldier's characters where doing in their room locked away (you will have to see it to find out)


 They shared the Fourth of July with the British soldiers and they were not offended!  They made the best of a bad situation and I decided to order the book the movie was made from so I can see how they made the composites
 It hopefully will be a good read


 If you love Steve McQueen, James Garner and Coburn, Sir Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson and Donald Pleasence plus James Clavell (Shogun) wrote the screenplay and John Sturges producing and directing...you have a winner.You will not be sorry you bought it and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know something about WWII history!

$REVIEW.: In order to enjoy this movie it is necessary for one, almost immediately, to suspend their disbelief as California was the state that pioneered no fault divorce. Unfortunately, it seems like the only people who haven't heard about it are the Coen brothers. Therefore, the bad news is that most of the plot is entirely implausible as it doesn't matter who cheated on whom or what they did during the relationship. That being said I still found Intolerable Cruelty to be tremendously enjoyable and fun to watch. Yes, it is a step down for the Coen brothers who have produced the greatest movies of the past two decades this side of Martin Scorsese. Certainly it is no Miller's Crossing but what else could be? Particularly provocative is its take on gold digging women which is very politically correct as it shows Zeta-Jones and her clique to be parasites and systematic exploiters of men. This take on male-female relations (at that particular socio-economic level) is rife with truth and far truer than the politically correct precept that women are victims. Actually, we find that these ladies to be quite empowered even if it is in the fashion of Bluebeard. The movie is a convincing reproduction of real life at the psychological, as opposed to legal, level which is another reason why I must recommend it. As for Clooney, he's absolutely excellent here. I don't think his performance could have been improved on by any other actor. Bravo!

$REVIEW.: Hangover 1 copied the theme of the Marrying Man with a twist of hallucinogenics in a silly approach to insert extreme porn materials which have always been proven to bring great profits.Hangover 2 kept the same characters, changed Las Vegas to Bangkok, added more porn, but kept the hallucinogenics as its underlying theme.Even the actors seemed bored with remembering irrelevant dialogues. You could easily sense their disbelief in their roles. Some actors were told to exaggerate actions in order to add excitement, but that made the crowd in odd with the passerby.The same boring clues that linked events after events, where pieces of papers, written messages on body parts, and forced insertion of scenes were used to make the scenario flow, with excessive screaming on discovering next moves.Mutilation was kept as in Hangover 1 with an actor slicing his ring finger. Vulgarity ratcheted up both in violent communication as well as in mellow vulgar singing.Mike Tyson also showed at the end as in Hangover 1, that was followed by the same reciting of the serials of photographs taken while intoxicating.Porn always worked. Every seat in every row was either reserved or occupied in a Friday's show. I watched Rio then tempted by the marsh of folks to Hangover 2.

Her high point was Cujo), but the plot is far shallower. It's watchable, and you still get into it on a purely visceral/animal level, but too many things just aren't believeable or are just too convenient. Still I guess it can satisfy the animalistic urges in all of us to a degree. The extras are OK; the interviews are interesting, the alternate ending laughable.

$REVIEW.: The Marx Brothers thought THE COCOANUTS was so awful they tried to buy it from Paramount in order to prevent its release.  Paramount declined and the film went on to become one of the most popular of the early talkies--but even so one shouldn't completely discount the brothers' opinion of the film, which never changed.  The cinematography is awkward and clunky; the sound ranges from mediocre to awful.  Beach dancers kick up sand in front of obviously painted back drops and the music is at best unmemorable, at worst truly awful in an eye-rolling sort of way.  (One should greatly beware the dreaded "Monkey Doodle Doo.")  And yet, even so hampered, the Marx Brothers zing brilliantly in their film debut, Margaret Dumont is equally memorable, and although her role is unsympathetic Kay Francis exerts enough star power for one to know that she will become a major screen actress--which she did and then some, becoming one of the highest paid actresses of the 1930s.Like all the films made by the brothers at Paramount, THE COCOANUTS includes four brothers: Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo, the latter a "straight man" who retired from the act when the brothers left Paramount for MGM.  Set during the Florida land boom of the 1920s, the film finds Groucho running a Florida resort with Zeppo's unenthusiastic experience.  They and their guests are soon beset by Harpo and Chico, two utterly incompetent theives who come to the hotel with the notion of robbing its wealthy guests.  Although Florida tourism and real estate are hot, Groucho can't turn a dime at either, and he soon begins to court the wealthy Mrs. Potter (the memorable Margaret Dumont), but she is distracted by her daughter Polly (Mary Eaton), who has formed a socially unfortunate attachment to Bob (Oscar Shaw.)  Mrs. Potter would prefer Polly to marry Harvey (Cyril Ring), who is unbeknownst to all associated with con-woman Penelope (Kay Francis.)As in most Marx Brothers movies, the plot is merely an excuse for set pieces, and this film has some lulus, including the famous "why a duck?" routine between Groucho and Chico.  All of these go off with a bang, but in truth they tend to make the rest of the film look even less impressive by comparison, and excepting Dumont and Francis the supporting cast is hardly memorable.  But the thing that makes many viewers regard THE COCOANUTS as a painful viewing experience is the film's static cinematography.  A very early talkie, the movie was filmed with the noisy camera placed inside a sound proof booth, so the microphone wouldn't pick up the grinding sound the camera made when running.  The result is a film that actively avoids camera movement, and although the camera does move around more than you might expect, the whole thing has a "stand there so we can get you in shot" quality.  When the Marx Brothers aren't on the scene to distract you from it, the cinematography has a truly tooth-gritting effect.THE COCOANUTS had originally been a memorable stage success for the Marx Brothers in 1925, and while filming it during the day the brothers were enjoying an even greater stage success at night, ANIMAL CRACKERS.  They would go on to film the latter as well, but by that time the technical issues that plagued THE COCOANUTS were greatly improved.  Although it too is on the stagey side, ANIMAL CRACKERS would well and truly dot THE COCOANUTS in the eye from an artistic and technical standpoint.  While it has its charms, THE COCOANUTS is a film best left to hardcore Marx Brothers fans and to those who are curious to see an early talkie.GFT, Amazon Reviewer

$review_text.: As a Alice Cooper fan since the early '70s, I must admit that the Billion Dollar Babies show that made it onto this DVD is fantastic and totally compelling.To me, the ride these guys were on in the years from 1969 to 1974  was really special


They were entirely different from everyone else, churning out garage-rock anthems on a couple of albums per year, and bringing it home as one of the world's biggest concert draws

So why is it that their stage performances remain on shelves somewhere? I don't care about the quality of it - it's historic!!The story-line aspect is fine (for a 1973 spoof), but I'm not likely to watch it again..


it's too corny and dated
If they had added (maybe on a second disc) another show or partial shows, that would have been more enjoyable, since there are times (especially during Alice's shock-rock/performance-art moments in the show) that the band's playing becomes quite cacaphonic.

FYI the whole concert can be heard along with Alice's recently added commentary...other reviewers may have mentioned this, and it's the best way to watch this particular show.

$REVIEW.: Originally aired as a t.v. miniseries, this remake of ON THE BEACH by Nevil Shute is tiresome and tedious.  The leads (Armand Assante, Rachel Ward and Bryan Brown) are outacted by relative unknowns Grant Bowler and Jacqueline Mackenzie, who play the Australian couple trying to maintain optimism in a world that looks bleak.  The movie ultimately becomes a dull love story focusing on an alcoholic woman (Ward) and her involvement with submarine admiral (Assante).  She also has a past with scientist Brown.  The movie also ends quite abruptly and without any real resolution; a bummer in my book.

$REVIEW.: Just because a movie features characters dealing with alcoholism or drug use or both, does that mean that it's automatically "one of the best movies of the year"? Don't get me wrong, I liked Requiem (well, parts of it) but there's enough to recommend a viewing but I always wonder whether people say these movies are masterpieces simply because it tackles a hard subject matter
I mean, have you ever heard of someone outright bashing a war movie? And so we have Requiem for a Dream, Darren Aronofsky's follow-up to the rightly praised Pi; a no-holds barred and unflinching look at drug use and the deterioration of them.The film follows 4 characters: Harry, his girlfriend Marion, Harry's friend Tyrone and Harry's mother Sara
The former 3 are drug users who pawn TV's to get money while Sara; hearing of the news she'll be on TV, takes diet pills to fit into her old dress
Pretty soon all 4 of them find themselves given a good mind **** about what it is to be addicted to something and the realization you ran out.The film uses many different filmmaking techniques to lend different images to its story


We have the snorricam (a camera attached to the actor, commonly seen in those night-vision haunted house TV shows), a camera shaking violently complete with warped sound, split screen, quick editing, dissolves and shots with fast-motion mixed with slow motion


This makes the film certainly visually packed with stuff but there's barely any substance
In other words, we don't care about these characters when we should; aside from Ellen Burstyn's character, everyone is just simply plot puppets as I call them


They're not fleshed out characters but the amount of visuals being used and the subject suggests we should care but we don't; we just see these drug addicts turn into something with no care about how they'll end up, we just watch them do it.Not to say there's nothing to recommend here because there is

Burstyn, as Aronofsky says in his commentary, is so all over the place within the same scene that it's sad she lost to that wench from Erin Brockovich


Hell, Juliette Binoche in Chocolat was better than her
And it's surprising to see Marlon Wayans doing a dramatic role and being good although he does at times do stuff that seems "Marlon-esque"
Jennifer Connelly is of course good while Christopher McDonald plays a great send-off of those bad motivational speakers you see on TV.While I am recommending the film, I hate the kind of self-knowing importance the film has

It's one thing to have an unrated "director's cut" the same thing since the film ignored the MPAA and just released the film unrated anyway but to have the Play button listed with "watch the inspirational film!" seems kind of egotistical to me

But at least it's a good movie at times so I won't be that harsh on that part.

$review_text.: This is a good film if you already like Russian modern cinema, but maybe not so good if you are unfamiliar with this genre. It is very earthy and depicts how crude life was in the USSR during ww2. It is basically about 3 escaped Red Army POW's who are trying to make their way back to the Soviet lines but get caught up in the local intrigues and politics of one of their father's home town, and the violence that ensues. Worth a look but the overall message is Russian Nationalism and screw the facts about the horrors of communism that cost so many of their lives. The Germans and their collaborators are the bad guys here and fall down like keystone cops when assaulted. The partisans and peasants win all the conflicts and all work together for Mother Russia. Yeah, right ! A one sided look at this era.The cinematography and acting is good, as are the uniforms and overall historical look of the film, but I can do without the one sided political perspective. An interesting film but don't expect objectivity.

 I am not big on nature documentaries, but this has really reawakened my interest in the outdoors & living creatures
 Life of Mammals is also excellent


 The pacing is gentle yet interesting, the juxtaposition of the birds is stimulating

 I have not gone birdwatching in about 10 years; after viewing this, I have not only resumed birdwatching, but I have a more intuitive way of looking at & appreciating the birds, which has helped me identify birds more quickly and accurately.David Attenborough seems to revere the wildlife with such a refreshing perspective--as if, despite all his expertise, he is still able to wonder at each action of each creature, and truly enjoy the small wonders of the world


 His enthusiasm is inspiring & his presentation of the material is compelling.

$review_text.: I'm not about to go over the seasons here. I will let it be known though that Little House On The Prairie is one of the greatest TV shows ever. It was a time where TV shows were innocent fun and anyone could watch it and not have to worry about foul language or some toilet humor.  A time where shows like Gilligan's Island, The Brady Bunch, Leave It To Beaver, were all seen on regular network TV on a daily run. Kids and family alike could enjoy!!  Gosh I miss those days of TV shows.So let's get to the point of why this BOX set is so bad and a one star. Well it's simple, it's chopped up and cut to bits.  At least give fans the UNCUT version of the show. It's not like there are commercials to worry about and if you expect us to pay a couple hundred dollars to own the whole show, then put a bit of effort into it and at least give the true fans what we want. UNCUT!!!!I'm not here to complain about the price. I'll GLADLY shell out plenty of cash for any show that I love, IF the company puts a bit of effort into taking the time to give me the real deal and not this edited down junk.  I'll put my cash towards another TV box set that is UNCUT and wait for the real deal here.  I refuse to pay for this set though, just so down the road the company can put out a UNCUT version and expect fans to pay again for this.STOP BEING SO LAZY!!!  Give the fans what we want and we will gladly buy the set.  Think about it.  A fan of any show that is going to go out and buy the complete TV series of a show, is a REAL fan.  Do companies actually think that we want some cut down, chopped up nonsense as this?WE WANT LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE IN A BEAUTIFUL BOX SET, UNCUT!!!!Thank you for reading, just needed to vent.  I'm angry because I love the show and REALLY DID want this.Micah

$REVIEW.: A great film, with a great cast. Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Liam Neeson, Rowan Atkinson, Keira Knightley, and many other stars play people who explore the theme of love over the Christmas holiday. With some great views of the city of London from the Thames, this movie will sweep you off your feet, so to speak.Beginning five weeks before Christmas, these characters explore love in many different ways. From the Prime Minister down through a kid who goes to America (Wisconsin, of all places!) in search of sex, all of these characters are exceptional in that they find something they are looking for. Its a very sweet comedy, though the relationships between the numerous couples are not well developed and slightly confusing. Some of the relationships are sad, such as the man who cheats on his wife, and the woman who can't commit to a relationship because of her brother's condition; but for the most part, many of them find love, such as the Prime Minster, who runs from house to house on Christmas Eve looking for the woman he loves. Most funny, however, is the aged potty-mouth rock star Billy Mack, whose song "Christmas is all around us" provides a backdrop to the whole movie (as the original words to the song were "Love is all around us").Most hopeful, I thought, was the man who is in love with his best friend's wife, who eventually gets to tell her how he feels about her. Another relationship which made me smile was the one between the young boy and the girl from his school, and the relationship between the British expatriot author and the Portugese housekeeper.This is a a great all-around romantic comedy, if you can keep track of all that goes on, and the relationships between certain couples.

$REVIEW.: I'm not a big war-movie buff any more (THE SEARCH FOR PRIVATE RYAN cured me) but this is a worthwhile film if you have an interest in WWII. TORA! TORA! TORA! is a documentary-type film.  Think of it as a Stephen Ambrose book recorded live. The film is neither a glorified fifties war-film (IN HARMS WAY, BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA), nor is it a Viet Nam noir-war film (PLATOON, THE DEER HUNTER). (Neither of which are particularly authentic.)TORA! TORA! TORA! recreates war from the perspective of news correspondent-participant-observer. The story is presented from both the Japanese and American viewpoints and it is presented like a History Channel film.It took the film crew several months to film TORA! TORA! TORA!  I was living in Navy housing on Pearl Harbor at the time and a number of our friends and acquaintences found part-time jobs acting in the film. &quot;Real&quot; military pilots in-between rounds in Viet Nam flew some of the planes (this was 1969).Much of the architecture in Honolulu was vintage WWII era or earlier and the rest of the island was relatively unchanged from the 1940s. The terrain looked very much as it had when my father-in-law passed through on his way to Guadalcanel and later Iwo Jima.I cannot tell you the names of the aircraft (my husband could) but I was told that they used real aircraft from the period including the P40s the U.S. flew and the captured Zeros the Japanese flew. We drove up to Schoffield Barracks to look at the old airplanes lined up row on row. During the filming, one of these old planes crashed in a sugar cane field and burned up before the pilot could be rescued. The daily flights overhead, the real crashes, the reenactment of the destruction in the harbor, the daily flights in and out of Hickam as men and material destined for Viet Nam left and wounded and dead arrived--was all very weird.Well, this is an excellent film.  The new PEARL HARBOR relies on all sorts of technology, but if you want to see how Hawaii really looked in 1941 and how the planes really looked, and how the crews really looked, and obtain some sense of how terrifying it was to be in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 this is the film to see.

$REVIEW.: September 11th: Memorial EditionI have a lot of mixed feelings on this movie. I'm not real sure I'd recommend this film to a friend. Why? In my case, the movie had 2 DVD's and the first worked great. The "day in the life" of people all over New York are captured on film by various sources. There's no "script". It's pure terror, as seen on the faces of the people.Since the 2nd DVD in the case was defective, I have no clue if it's worthy of a review. The first DVD showing the film of that day is eerie and graphic. It is truly fascinating but I would've preferred hearing more from the victims who were fleeing but most of it was noise, background noise and oftentimes "muffled" conversations.

$REVIEW.: My first introduction to these 50 movie packs was the great Horror Classics set, which had older movies from the 20s to the 60s. This one has more titles from the 60s through the 80s. These are more drive-in type movies. We've glot lots of explotation goodness here. The set as a few stink bombs, like House of the Dead and The Cold, but it has more than enough great moives to make it a good deal. Heck, at justa bout 28 cents per movie, you can't gripe too much. Now, when I say it has some great movies, you must be a fan of these kinds of movies in order to get full enjoyment out of them. If you are the kind of person who spent their youth going to the video store on Friday night, renting splatter movies and Italian horror classics, this is for you. If your view of horror begins and ends with Scream and Final Destination, you might be let down.Some stand outs here are;Deep RedVirusBad Taste (Peter Jackson's AWESOME first movie)Messiah of EvilFuneral HomeDevil Times 5Werewolf in a Girls Dormitory (sp)Silent Night Bloodey NightLady FrankensteinDeath Rage (not horror, but bad-A** action movie)If you love renting old, cheasy movies and hate Blockbuster, because they never have the good old stuff, get this set. I don't have Drive-In Classics yet, but it looks good. Also, if you like the older, late night Chiller Theatre type stuff like me, look into the Horror classics set as well. I also have the Sci-Fi set, which looks good, but I haven't watched it. yet.One world of caution. The titles on these sets seem to change a little, depending on when you get them. The set I have doesn't match exactly the titles listed her on Amazon, which doesn't mach exactly the list ont he company's web site. Most of the titles are the same, but some seem to come and go.

$review_text.: This PPV is #10 on my list of the 130 greatest WWE DVD's.  A lot of people think Unforgiven was bad but I thought it was pretty good.Shawn Michaels vs. Kane was a classic match and Shawn made Kane look good.  Kane tried to break Shawn's neck in June but it didn't work and Shawn got his revenge on the Big Red Monster.La Resistance vs. Rhyno & Tajiri was a cheap match that I think was a screw job from the beginning.  I have been complaning that La Resistance are the tag champs but now Eugene & regal are Champs!!!  Even worse.Randy Orton vs. Triple H is Triple H's cheapest match ever when he uses Coach, Flair, Batista, a steel chair & a Pedigree to beat Orton.  Orton should get a rematch its in his contract.This is a must have DVD and there is also a Ladder Match on here.  Unforgiven was great.

$REVIEW.: This film doesn't rank as a classic or great Western in my opinion, but it's worth a look. The sets and cinematography are probably the most realistic I've ever seen in a Western: the dustiness, the sod-roofed cabin, the griminess of the actors, the plain (very plain) clothing, etc. However, I found it a bit hard to accept Audrey Hepburn portraying an American Indian (even though she is an exceptional actress, she isn't a convincing Indian). Her speech patterns differ greatly from everyone else's in the film, and when she says "ain't ya?" with her European-style speech, it made my skin crawl. She just appears anachronistic in this film; it's not Audrey's style or form. However, Charles Bickford, Lillian Gish, and Audie Murphy are all excellent in their respective roles. Burt Lancaster has seen better films, though. In addition, the chemistry was absent between he and Hepburn. She obviously had a schoolgirl-type crush on her adopted big brother, but I never felt that his supposedly romantic feelings for her were genuine. The lynching scene is effectively horrifying, as is the final scenes of mass slaughter.  This is a disturbing movie, and although quite dated, it does address race relations between the pioneering whites and the American Indians (of course, all from the pioneers' point of view, which was typical of 1950s Westerns). Worth a look, but I wouldn't purchase it unless you are an intense Western fan or just want to see Audrey Hepburn in an incredibly unusual role.

$review_text.: Romance between a (apparently) temporary zombie and real human. It is entertaining and a new twist on zombie flicks which appear to be proliferating these days. I would have liked more details about how it is that these zombies are able to become human again after the fact is established that they need to eat human brains to survive. But as it is a fantasy - that is left to the imagination. Basic tale is that love conquers all...even being a zombie. Nicholas Hoult is a real charmer in this movie. I hardly recognized Rob Corddry as M.

$review_text.: I bought this about 3 years ago and watched and loved it then. It was relatively new then (on dvd) and was very new to me. There weren't many reviews back then but now that this product has been around some reviews here really have taken me aback and forced this rewrite. After getting through the Fifth Episode, "The Legacy" on this my second run through, I was just accosted by a sense of loss. This series was so damn good it's almost difficult to watch (knowing it's fate). The reviews here that have shaken me are the ones that say A. It's boring, B. The plots are all the same. While we are entitled to an opinion neither A nor B is acceptable to me.Surely, a major tension are Galen, Burke, and Virdon running from Urko but if you can watch episodes like The Good Seeds or The Legacy and only take away A.) Men and chimp run from big gorillas; frankly I'm amazed you were smart enough to buy this set to begin with. The way The Legacy weaves our past from the future is surely a stroke a brillance, not to mention getting the jump on big names like Star Wars and Superman with the use of the hologram. All I'm asking for is the respect it deserves. And talk about getting "a jump"... this duo bare a remarkable resemblance to Starsky and Hutch (another show I love) that will not be born for ANOTHER year, 1975!And now, my old review: January 20, 2002New Found Friends:Let me first put my credentials on the table. I am a fan of the universe created by the Planet Of The Apes the original movie. On the strength of that one movie I have fallen in love with the aura that is Planet Of The Apes. I loved the look of the housing, the set-up of the society, and the wonderous soundtrack. However, that's almost where it ended because I never cared for ANY of the sequels or the revision (though "Escape" had its merits). It pained me to be so in love with a piece of work without being able to embrace more of the body. Enter curiousity. When I first saw a few reviews of the TV series pop-up here at Amazon I waited to see more and more... as more and more 4 and 5 stars arose I became sure it would be a worthy buy (though naturally concerned I would be disappointed).Planet Of The Apes The TV Series: I went into this boxset with the understanding that the visuals would not be up to par with the first movie, that never bothered me because I am a fan of the original Star Trek series, needless to say, 'nuff said. However, these visuals actually range from being good to quite great in a 70's TV sort of way. The crumbled city in The Legacy looks remarkable, even the masks look good when not in extreme close-ups. Understand, I had never watched the series while it was on TV (I was in 1st grade), so I am judging this purely on this new experience, and I am amazed.Cast: Virdon, Burke, and Galen are instantly likable. I felt after watching the first episode that the chemistry was perfect. From Virdons every mans hero stance and knowledge to Burkes absolutely dead-pan sarcasm to Galens insatiable curiousity, each character has a pupose. Mark Lenard is also good in this though not actually in each episode as much as I had assumed he would be. That is alright though, because the main cast is MORE than adequate.Transfer & Sound: The transfer to dvd while it is generally "good" certainly is far from perfect. A lot of the time as a scene starts there is "noise" (not sure how to explain it) flickering on the screen and the sound is a dissappointing mono(Star Trek in '67 was remastered in 5.1 DS). However, I cannot be happier with the score. It is INCREDIBLE! So absolutely fitting with the original movie, the score is instantly recognizable and helps to create the "mood" of the series every bit as much as the Star Trek score did for that series.The dvd case: I had read on here that a few people had problems with the rather bloated case that houses the four discs. I am not one of them. The artwork is great and the case fits perfectly next to my POTA and POTA Behind The Scenes.Conclusion: I am only halfway through this wonderous boxset and yet I was compelled to write my review. I didn't want to RUSH through the 14 episodes to write my review and yet I just couldn't wait. Somehow, I feel as though I have been watching this series for a lifetime, it just seems so grounded. As though the cast had been making this series for 10 years and these episodes were merely pulled from the middle of the series. Virdon, Burke, and Galen were not only worth my time, they were worth every penny (and then some).

$review_text.: 1986 brought the third of three John Hughes / Molly Ringwald movies, "Pretty in Pink", and I'm afraid it's the worst of the three.The storyline asks us to suspend disbelief over and over again, Molly's character seems weak and childish at times, and Jon Cryer is just annoying as the misfit "Duckie".I am a huge Molly Ringwald fan, but "Pretty in Pink" is certainly a step down from the heights of "The Breakfast Club" and the pinnacle of "Sixteen Candles".On a side note, Annie Potts is great (as usual) in a supporting role."Pretty in Pink" will be a necessary purchase for any 80s, Brat Pack, Hughes, or Ringwald fan, but it lacks a certain "something" that the other movies seem to have.
$SUMMARY.: Pales in comparison to other Hughes/Ringwald collaborations.

$REVIEW.: "Curse of the Golden Flower" appears to be another "Hero" or "House of Flying Daggers" but in reality it is a Chinese soap opera. Ironically director Yimou Zhang is resposnbile for those two films as well as "Curse of the Golden Flower". His knack for vibrant colors and stunning martial arts is evident in his latest film.The story takes place in China during the Tang Dynasty. Chow Yun Fat plays Emperor Ping. He is married to Empress Phoenix (Gong Li). She has helped raised Ping's first song Prince Wan (Ye Liu who played Snow Wolf from "The Promise"), as well as bore him two sons Jai (Jay Chou) and Chen (Junjie Qin). It doesn't take long to discover the drama that is going on behind closed doors like Phoenix's relationship with her stepson Wan. Then there is the empress' failing health and the cause of her failing health. There are a few twists and turns in the story line but they were pretty much predictable especially when it involved Wan's biological mother and his secret love interest Chan. Nevertheless I enjoyed the story much more so than in "Hero" and it was less confusing than "House of Flying Daggers". I loved the vibrant colors in the costumes and scenery. They were absolutely gorgeous. "Curse of the Golden Flower" was a lot of fun to watch. It is a bit overdramatic and predictable but thoroughly engaging and fun to watch.

$REVIEW.: Well I have to say, this trailer did grab me by the ghoulies when I first saw it

 Little did I know it was gonna take me on a trip that would never bring me back
 I'm not gonna summerize the story, becuz everyone above has already

 What I am going to talk about is the plot outline

 I'm gonna say this film leaves alot to be desired
 I'm saying its good...but it could have been a hella lot better


There's alot of loose ends throughout the film
 For one, why did Duke Red found the Marduk party? to what purpose? If he was going to use a robot to control the Ziggurat, why would he want to destroy them all? Another quick ponder is, Why is Rock the way he is?  What's the deal with the homicical tendencies? And probably the most aggravating one that really hurt me the most; there was hardly any love between Tima and Kenichi...You could tell that it was supposed to be there, but Kenichi hardly showed any real love for her, more like an adoration for each other


 So it was hard for me to believe the ending becuz the lack of love between them


 And one last one would be why the whole confusion between Duke Red, The President, and the Revolutionists? All these must be connected in order for a great story...They were all there but weakly connected

 As for the animation, top notch, uncanny perfection in the movement, speaking as an animator myself, the cg was perfect and hit the scene sweetly

 And the strongest thing of the whole film I thought was the score


 Amazing Jazz, Dixieland, and some techno beats are weaved intricately throughout the film...That is what kept me going
 It might seem like I'm really hitting this film hard, but believe me its one of my favorites on my top ten
 Don't check it out, get it

 I still love it, with its flaws and all.

I really was worried that there wasn't going to be anymore releases after Season 2 as they kept delaying the Season 3 release.  The good news according to TVShowsOnDVD.com is that the studio is reporting that they are already hard at work on Season 4 and unofficially, they are hoping to release it in May or June of 2006.

$REVIEW.: Coming into Speed Racer, I had very low expectations for the film. I hated the cartoon, it looked a bit childish, and the Wachowski siblings helmed it. What could go wrong? Well, plenty does go wrong, but plenty goes right. Granted, most of these moments have nothing to do with the filmakers and lay solely in the CGI department, but I was surprised with this film, in a good way.This film is a true roller-coaster in more than ways than one. Quality-wise, it goes from interesting, to bad to just plain stupid, which it stays at for awhile. Then when Speed Racer agrees to run the forbidden death race, the film starts taking an uphill turn, going from bad, to just so bad, it's good. I mean, the Ninja scene will cause you to laugh out loud, but not because it's funny, but because it's just SO bad.It's when the death race really starts going where the visuals start carrying the movie. The crashes, the environments, the action, the falls and drops all contribute the movie's jaw-droppingly amazing visuals. Several moments produced a verbal 'Wow' for me, making this a must to at least see once in HD. Then in-between races, the movie starts coming together, for most part becoming a good to great movie, depending on what moment you're at. The final race brings the movie all together and really makes it worthwhile, for the most part.Where does the movie go wrong besides the absurdity and stupidity of many "serious" scenes written by the Wachowski siblings? Chiefly, the movie tries to hard to appeal to everybody. It doesn't really strike me as a kid's movie, mainly because of the action, story and visuals will fly over most youngsters heads, but yet, Speed's younger brother and chimp way overstay their welcome. It's a bit cute at the beginning, but then they start cutting into the good stuff. You're then forced to go between the more intense races and fights as such, only to be broken up by the antics of the overly childish duo. I mean, there's kid friendly, then there's stupid. They fall mostly into the latter category.The acting is decent overall, everybody does good with their roles, especially Cristina Ricci, and Matthew Fox does the best with what he's given. However, the movie makes a grave casting error. The role of the evil & cheesy corporate giant Royalton should have been filled by Tim Curry. I mean the no-name who does it in the movie played the character like he was Tim Curry. He sounded like Tim Curry, he acted like Tim Curry, and Tim Curry would have been brilliant in the role, because it was perfect and made for him. Sure it was small, but it bugged me throughout the WHOLE movie.Overall, Speed Racer greatly surprised me, although my fears were both confirmed then denied. It's a whirl-wind of a movie that could have been done better without the Wachowskis, and with a lot of editing, since the film clocks in at over 2 hours. There's lot to love and hate, with most of the love coming from the visual effects department. What's weired is, I actually wouldn't mind a sequel. But like that's ever going to happen!Real Score: 3.5

$review_text.: This is a 3.5 star review, for true aficionados probably a four-star production. I had remembered this BBC production of Count Dracula as very effective with Louis Jourdan as an especially scary Count Dracula. On replay I still find Jourdan's Count Dracula to be quite scary in his deliberate use of under play. What had seemed like a classic BBC use of minimal and inexpensive staging at least for the interior shots; on replay looks like the worst of the original sets in the old TV classic Dark Shadows.This is a case of a production that was quite successful in BBC of 1977 terms; failing to maintain its effect in 2013. With all, Bram Stoker would have been very proud of this production. It is so close to the original one could almost follow it using the original text as a script.The particular slant on this version is of a Gothic romance complete with the victims finding themselves in a sexual love hate relationship with their fanged master. This aspect should recommend this version is especially desirable to the crowd now following the concept of vampires as romantic and desirable. For all the new vampire romances out there one would think this version of Bram Stoker's original would be more in demand.As is typical in BBC productions supporting actors and actresses provide capable workmanship. Unfortunately the overall effect of performance and scenes for me tended to be a flat. The scenes between Jack Shepherd as Renfield, Dracula's London contact, and of the original Dark Lord did not work well for me in 1977 and look a little cheesy in 2013. Frank Finley as the heroic Dr. Van Helsing is quite good but now not as convincing.The ghostly scenes of the various Dracula women being alternately seductive and evil were fairly effective 40 years ago and now seem to symbolize all that is not quite right about this not quite right production.For all that this version of Count Dracula is stilted and flat it is very true to the original. Allowing for its shortcomings it is worthy of a viewing if not a purchase. For anyone wondering what inspired the Gothic movement long before Gothic was cool (it is cool right?) Louis Jourdan makes the case that Dracula can be cool.

The longest running dramatic series in television history speaks for itself.My continuing reviews reflect the release schedule fiasco and the accompanying pricing for the half seasons. Simple math...half seasons should be half priced. Paramount/CBS will continue the split season nonsense as long as there are buyers who "buy in." I stopped patronizing after season 1.I recall a reviewer indicating Paramount/CBS botched Season 2 Volume 1 because they pulled episodes from another season and placed them on this volume...and people are paying for the mess.Paramount/CBS did Season 1 right, and now they're deciding (with this series and some others) to reinvent the wheel. If it isn't broken, don't break it ;-)Simple formula...Complete seasons at competitive pricing.

$REVIEW.: It goes without saying that the humor seen and heard on this show is an acquired taste.  The second, and final, volume of Adult Swim's underrated The Brak Show is disappointing in terms of show quality and DVD features to boot.  What made the episodes found on the first volume so good was the interplay between Brak (voiced by Andy Merrill) and Zorak; but sadly much of that gets downplayed here.  Not to mention that the dry humor doesn't come off as funny a lot, instead only ending up being more miss than hit.  That's not to say that there's not some funny moments popping up in every episode or so, and the voice work by Merrill, C. Martin Croker, and George Lowe, is spectacular as usual.  What's even more disappointing about this DVD set is that there are no special features whatsoever included on either disc of the set.  Now I know that Adult Swim DVD's are usually sparse on extras, but this is ridiculous.  Not to mention that the New Years Eve episode, which was one of the best from the series and included many characters from other shows in the Adult Swim lineup, isn't here at all either.  If you're a die hard Brak fan, and I mean die hard, this is worth picking up; otherwise, leave this on the shelf.

$REVIEW.: I have seen so many, many movies but this one I think has to be my all time favorite.  The whole setting of the liberal arts college, the 50s conservative setup in which the college dwells so firmly in, and the magical aura of a bygone era captivates you right form the start of the film. Top that with some beautiful photography, a nice gripping story and some convincing performances and you've got a great film.This is a movie that will lift you up and make you smile. Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) Encourages students to reject conformity in any form and pursue careers rather than settle down as housewives. Colleagues advise the new professor that the trick to surviving Wellesley is to go unnoticed, as too much independence frightens administrators, who she is told have claws under their gloves.With this movie, I think many people will discover that not only students learn from teachers, but everyone learns from others.

$REVIEW.: How perfect a movie this is...and that it finally gave Steven Spielberg the cred he had been due for so long is even better...well beforeSaving Private RyanandLincoln. (Did you know Spielberg doubted himself, and actually tried to pass off the director's chair to Martin Scorsese, Sydney Pollack and Roman Polanski?)Of course it's more than that: it is not just Spielberg who deserves all the credit, but there is indeed so much credit he does deserve:...It's the powerhouse book by Thomas Keneally calledSchindler's Ark....It's the decision to do it in black and white (save for the girl in red, an idea that came to him when one of the actual camp survivors told the director a story about a four-year old girl shot before his eyes)....It is the sensational acting, led of course by Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley....It is the powerful musical score created by John Williams, including a terrific performance by Itzhak Perlman....It is the crisp, period-inspired and stark realism photography of cinematographer Janusz Kami&#324;ski, who worked without a storyboard....It is the brilliant eye of production designer Allan Starski, whose job it was to darken or lighten the sets so that the actors would not recede into the backdrops (costumes too were addressed in this manner)....And finally, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, let us not forget that it is due to the REAL Oskar Schindler, who did indeed save more than twelve hundred lives by employing them in his factories. Schindler, who died in 1974 in poverty brought about by his liquidating everything he had in order to "employ" his mostly Polish-Jewish workers. He was a man who had begun the war as a relatively amoral businessman who knew how to "work" the German war machine to profit himself, but eventually found himself a conscience, and did something so simple that no one else seemed to really think of it.

$review_text.: Humanity is at a crossroads. Evolution has reared its head. There are human beings in the world today with extraordinary gifts and powers. These powerful beings are called "mutants." And their existence scares some people.In the United States, Senator Robert Kelly has introduced legislation that will require all mutants to "register" as such. He feeds the fear by telling his peers, and the public, some of what he's heard these mutants can do.Two of the most powerful mutants, Professor Charles Xavier (Professor X), and his old friend, Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto), have different agendas of how best to deal with humanity's intolerance of mutants.The Professor believes that patience is a virtue in this case. Humanity will come around eventually, he believes. In the meantime, he has established a "School for the Gifted," where he teaches his students how to control and master their powers for the good of humanity.Magneto, on the other hand, believes that a war between humans and mutants is inevitable. Instead of waiting for it to happen, however, he wants to go on the offensive. If it's a war humans want, it's a war they will get. One way or the other, Magneto will see to it that the mutant race is the only race that survives.That, in a nutshell, is all you need to know before going to see this movie, though you could really no nothing at all and not have to worry. "X-Men" does an excellent job of setting the stage for those viewers who no nothing of the world of mutants.The X-Men universe has been around for a very long time, with several incarnations in both the comic book and cartoon series world. Each incarnation has its own version of the struggle between humanity and mutants, as well as its own telling of the backgrounds of the characters. There is a very rich history to draw from, with a possible cast of hundreds of mutants to draw from.One of the reasons I liked this movie so much is that director Bryan Singer didn't try to introduce too many mutants all at once. Although long-time mutant lovers would have loved it, novice mutant viewers would have been too overwhelmed to follow the story. Instead, the main storyline was limited to just a handful of mutants (Professor X, Magneto, Rogue, Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Dr. Jean Grey, Sabertooth, Toad, and Mystique). However, he also treated long time X-Men fans to a glimpse of many other mutant favorites (including Iceman, Pyro, Jubilee, and Kitty to name a few).I also thought the casting of this movie was near perfection. Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation) made such a great Professor X that you almost begin to think that the comic book character was originally written with him in mind. Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings) as Magneto was also a great choice. Fanke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) were also very well choices.However, my favorite casting decision has got to be Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. I don't know who it was that saw the potential he had to play this part, but it was very much the right call. Of all the characters, the casting of Wolverine is the one that could have broken the entire movie for long time X-Men fans. Thankfully, Jackman was the perfect choice and we were treated to a great portrayal.I know some long time X-Men fans were disappointment that his or her favorite mutant did not make it into the movie. However, there is great potential for not only more X-Men movies (at the time of this review, X2: X-Men United has already been released and pre-production work is currently in progress for X-Men 3), but also for more specialized mutant movies focusing on one, two, or three mutants at a time (right now, rumors are circulating about a movie featuring Wolverine and one featuring Storm). If done correctly, this franchise can last for many, many years.The original VHS version also comes with three extras that are rare of videos: 8 deleted scenes, an interview with director Bryan Singer, and animated storyboards.Boiled down: "X-Men" has terrific action, great special effects, good casting, a solid plot, and is a lot of fun. I truly recommend that you add this to your movie collection.

$REVIEW.: I never thought a film could be made like the 1992Chinese presentation of "The Untold Story"


 Let mestart by saying that this is the only film in all myyears of moviegoing that actually nauseated me

 Giveme credit

 I have a very strong stomach
 Maybe whatmakes it so horrific is that it is based on trueevents

 I thought I had seen it all...now (maybe) Ihave
 I love horror, gore, frightening tales ofterror, but this one crosses the line

 It isshocking...to say the least...and it doesn't start outthat way.The crew of police officers and detectives in thisfilm are a bunch of comedians

 They are constantlyribbing one another...find excuses not to work...and Ithought I was in store for a Chinese rendition of MelGibson and Danny Glover in "Lethal Weapon"

 Inafterthought, their comedic relief is to take pressureoff the gruesome antics of a psychotic killer AnthonyWong, who won Honk Kong's Film Award for Best Actor in1993
 Best actor?  This guy is so convincing hescared the hell out of me.While I find it just as hard to understand how such afilm could be made, I was more perplexed over the factthat I WATCHED IT!  Wong is a true psycho-maniac.There are moments that are simplydisgusting...overboard...unthinkable


 And, of course,I had to buy the ORIGINAL UNCUT VERSION!  Guess what?There's nothing "uncut" about it...if you get mydrift


 Words of wisdom:Stay away from the barbecued pork buns and beware ofthe chopsticks.If you're brave enough to watch this, you may want tobe selective as to who (if anyone) joins you


 I'veseen "Silence of the Lambs", "Dahmer", "Portrait of aSerial Killer", "Bundy", "Helter Skelter"...and a hostof deranged serial killer flicks, but this one takesthe cake...or, better yet, "cuts" it.In the gruesome serial killer genre', this one is a"10"

 If you can't handle this type of flick, Irecommend "Shrek 2"...your side will split fromlaughter...not via a meat cleaver.

$review_text.: Hard to believe this great movie has so few reviews.I was impressed from the opening scene of dancers leaping across the stage to the final zipper at the end of the movie the very first time I saw this movie 20-odd years ago, and every time since.As Joe Gideon's producer said, &quot;every dollar is on the screen&quot;.I had the feeling I was really watching a work of genius. Even if the movie is Bob Fosse's bloated egotistical account of his life and career (not my viewpoint), it is still amazing in its scope. To predict your own death is one thing, but to put into one of the best 20 minutes on film is quite another.Good acting, writing, directing, cinematography - you name it, it's there.Sparse extras on the DVD, but worth it for the movie alone.

$review_text.: When I read a recent stock description that descibed the monarchy as "heartless" in relation to Prince John, I felt compelled to say that this is not an issue of "heartless monarchy," as anyone familar with the time and subject undoubtedly knows. The Monarchy was acting in a way that simply underscored its core principles-- the young Prince's epilelpsy was a complete unknown in royal circles, and indeed, the most prudent advice (at the time) was taken. It is impled at several points in this film that historically cold-as-ice Queen Mary was confused and heartbroken over the separation and eventual loss of her son (though the same may not be said of the gruff and callous King George V).More importantly, the far deeper foundation of this magnificent BBC piece is the decline and fall of both the European aristocracy and the British Empire as the new world order of the 20th Century began to form, sparked by WWI. Through the eyes of Pronce John a deeper shift is grasped-- and while he may not know it, we certainly do.There is little evidence historically to suggest that the future Duke of Kent was so devoted to his young brother-- in fact, presumably due to schooling, The Prince of Wales, The Dukes of York and Gloucester and Princess Mary are all but absent. But for the sake of the plot, the young Duke of Kent adds an important human element-- as does governess Lalla, of whom little is known, but much is ascribed to here (and much liberty is taken with the enigmatic Lalla for the sake of the piece).Still, this is a very accurate, very important piece of work. More than anyone, Miranda Richardson seems to capture Queen Mary with more dignity and repressed emotion (her hallmarks) than any actors I have seen.In short, this is not a piece about "cruel royalty," as the marketing would have you believe, with its very 21st century, post-Diana terms (the monarchy has always been heartless, it seems to imply). Far from it. This is a period piece marking a crucial time for the European aristocracy, and the allegory of John's death is really the death of the "Old World," as defined by late Victorian and Edwardian England.Truly a magnificent piece of work, though some basic knowledge of early Windsor history would add to the overall understanding and enjoyment of the piece.

$review_text.: I'll say it straight out; I'm pro-gun and proud of it
I'm also a lover of nearly any and everything film related, though this movie is just pure garbage.The whole thing is  poorly shot, acted, and written anti-gun propaganda

In an awful attempt to be ironic, the movie has ex-CIA agent Snipes (who has starred in more than a few movies that glorify guns) holding gun executive Fiorentino hostage with a sniper rifle.Not only does the movie completely fall flat with it's rapport between the leads (unlike Phone Booth, which has a similar scenerio but is brilliantly executed), but the movie takes the trouble to insist that gun companies are responsible for deliberately giving out arms to gang members
While it's definitely not anywhere near below the anti-gun lobby to lie, the assertion that the gun industry hands out firearms to gangs is so ridiclious that even a detailed look at any anti-gun website won't make the claim

This movie is ridiclious, and instead of trying to make a sensible argument for gun control, it decides to try to manipulate emotion and distort the truth, much like Bowling for Columbine
Unless you're rabidly anti-gun, avoid this at all costs.

$REVIEW.: Compared to the "family" garbage that Hollywood regularly chucks out like McDonalds bags to the suburban roadside today--the Rugrats, Spy Kids, etc.--"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" is one or those rare gems that sports both a superb cast and a great story.  Terribly underrated as a musical (several songs are quite good, and the score overall is lush), what separates it most from the celluloid fertilizer that stinks up the local cineplex is that the family here truly is held together by love and kindness.  Thus, there are no wise-... kids thinking they're smarter than the adults, no adults whose selfish pursuits blind them to everyone else's needs, no cynicism to poison children too young to realize yet that life, indeed, can be quite enjoyable.  Instead, this whimsical story about a kind-hearted, if daffy inventor who resurrects for his children a hunk of junk into a kid-friendly version of the car from "Goldfinger" (no coincidence--Ian Fleming wrote this story, too.) delights with its good center.  Along the way, the family, joined by the beautiful daughter of a local candy magnate, is transported to a magical kingdom where children are illegal.  If your family life was a trainwreck, you just won't get the sweetness of it all, but for those of us who had truly loving parents, the film resonates (even if there are typical overtones of British ethnocentrism and one or two risque lines).  The only real problem is that the widescreen version is not available--what blockhead decided to release it in scan-and-pan?

$REVIEW.: Right now we're still too close to &quot;Titanic&quot; to say whether or not, flaws and all (especially its screenplay, which wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award), will be considered a classic.&quot;Ben Hur,&quot; the other film that won 11 Oscars, made the American Film Institute's top 100 list, but beyond the great chariot race, few people have great affection for it because of its aloof and emotionally distant tone.But my best guess is in about 20 years, people will come to better appreciate this film as being deserving to be placed in the &quot;classic&quot; category, flaws and all, primarily because of its global impact at the time it was released and its INTENTIONAL use of maudlin themes and a romantic narrative that truly borrows from the glory days of romantic American cinema of the 1930s and 1940s.This is perhaps why Janet Maslin of the New York Times declared that &quot;Titanic&quot; was the first film in decades that earned the right to be debated and compared to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (now let's be honest, that was a corny movie too, wasn't it?).&quot;Titanic&quot; may not be &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; but the comparison is good
 Gable was well known, but who knew Vivien Leigh?  DiCaprio and Winslet, before &quot;Titanic,&quot; were accomplished young film actors, both with previous Oscar nominations, but not in the upper box office tier of stars


 And this is &quot;Titanic's&quot; overriding strength

What if more well-known stars had been cast in the lead roles? It would've cast a completely different light and tone.The fact that &quot;Titanic&quot; became a pop culture phenomenon has diminished it in many ways to elitist critics and others who have parodied everything about it, from its over-played Celine Dion theme song to its stick-figure characters (e.g., it reminds me of what happened to &quot;Rocky&quot; after winning Best Picture in 1976, only to have its accomplishments diluted by its bad sequels).My recollection is that NO ONE, least of all the critics, expected &quot;Titanic&quot; to become a hit


 In fact, there was initial fondness that the film still &quot;held together,&quot; despite well-known and horrific delays associated with bringing this &quot;summer release&quot; to the screen in December 1997


 As the film's gross returns got bigger each week, &quot;Titanic,&quot; despite high production costs, became regarded as the three-hour &quot;underdog&quot; that prevailed


 In my mind, the voices of dissent became noticeably louder only after the film was nominated for a record-tying 14 Academy Awards.Historical inaccuracies abound, but like &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; romantic considerations were paramount to avoid a &quot;flat&quot; telling of what everyone knows will happen to the ship
 Hence upon seeing &quot;Titanic&quot; the first time, I was amazed the story was engaging at all, albeit in an idealized 1940s style, cliches and all

 It's equally amazing that any film can become a box-office champ without a single computer-generated alien, dinosaur or space ship


 The &quot;romance&quot; is what made &quot;Titanic&quot; popular, especially with young people


 It's not the &quot;romance&quot; of great literature, it's the romance of the type we saw in &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot;  It's simple and uncomplicated, and again, it's executed in a style borrowed from the golden age of cinema.In sum, the intellectual snobbery against &quot;Titanic&quot; will never threaten its universal popularity
 The money put into this film is all on the screen, and the lack of an &quot;intelligent&quot; script -- is overwhelmed by the momentum of the film's idealized romance and impending destruction -- lifted even higher by its perfect ending (always the most important factor determining whether a film has a chance of entering the pantheon of greats.)If you take the historian's view, &quot;Titanic's&quot; accomplishments are too large to dismiss

 And if it had been released in 1947 instead of 1997, I'm convinced even MORE people would be in its corner today


 But this will never change the minds of people who hate it
 So just don't listen.

It's composed of the parts of the show he really likes; mostly dancing Teletubbies, and &quot;baby sun face.&quot; The tubbies do a follow the leader dance, a splashing dance,  and a stomping dance, plus a few others, I think.As soon as I put in  this video, my son started dancing, without any encouragement. Now, he's  starting to try to trot when the video comes to the &quot;trot-trot&quot;  part. This video makes him laugh and smile a lot, and calmed him down a lot  when he couldn't sleep the night before a surgery. While the things it  teaches aren't what most would consider &quot;learning objectives&quot;  (dancing, trotting, waving bye-bye) it's definitely right at my son's  learning level. A great investment if you have a kid age 10 months to 18  months, I think.

$REVIEW.: "This is Philip Marlowe leave your message after the tone..." If "Marlowe" had opened with these lines I wouldn't have been surprised in the least even though it was made four years before "The Rockford Files". "Marlowe" based on one of Raymond Chandler's lesser known novels entitled "The Little Sister". Writer Sterling Sillipant and director Paul Bogart give us an update bringing the story into the swinging 60's. The screenplay by  Sillipant ("In the Heat of the Night")keeps the basic elements of Chandler's story and while the direction is a bit pedestrian the performances especially star James Garner, Carroll O'Connor, William Daniels, Rita Moreno and a supporting turn by Bruce Lee prior to his leap (pardon the pun...watch the movie and you'll understand)make for an enjoyable mystery/thriller.Working on a missing persons case for a young woman (Sharon Farrell), Marlowe finds two of his potential leads dead with ice picks buried in their necks. He suddenly finds himself on the receiving end of an assault and threats for a case that suddenly takes a vicious turn.Warner Archive has done a nice job on this DVD-R on demand. The print does contain speckles and there's some dirt and grit visible during the opening titles (no surprise)but, on the whole, the print looks quite nice even if there hasn't been any attempt to restore the film. Detail is nice and while the image occasionally veers on the soft side "Marlowe" looks quite nice for a 42 year old movie.Audio sounds quite good with dialogue coming through nice and clear. It's a pity that there are no subtitles though as the likely audience for this movie would probably appreciate it.The only special feature included is the original trailer for the movie.While the film is a bit dated, it's a delight to see Garner in the role as Marlowe. Sillipant alters the material so that the role of Marlowe fits Garner like a well tailored suit. O'Connor and Moreno give terrific supporting turns that help elevate the material.Recommended for fans of Garner, vintage late 60's films and Raymond Chandler. "Marlowe" may not be a perfect movie but this minor 60's classic is still an enjoyable flick.
$review_summary.: Although dated "Marlowe" still enjoyable primarily due to James Garner's winning performance

$review_text.: I watched this in high school in 1983 and loved the story & performances by the excellent actors.  Lee Remick, Angela Lansbury & the rest of the cast turn in stellar performances but the standout is Polly Holliday.  During this era, she was known so well for being the gum-chewing, &#34;kiss my grits!&#34; waitress from the sitcom &#34;Alice&#34;. Here, we see her portraying a character who resents the hand life has dealt her. . . but, below the crusty exterior stirs a loving heart. The movie simply takes place during Christmas and has more to do with how we deal with the ups and downs of life during middle age, adolescence, etc . . .

WHile portraying post WW I German movie industry as one of drug-abusing, pseudo-intellectual S&amp;M types, it does a terrific job of creating empathy for the vampire.Instead of relishing immortality, nosferatu is lonely, lost and languishing in a steady descent in madness.THe flick does a good job of contrasting the madness of Milkovich's character with the vampire of Defoe.An interesting spin on vampirism.

Paul Newman; Steve McQueen; William Holden; Robert Wagner, among a host of other exceptionally good supporting actors, do a fine job in each of their respective roles.  The various interpersonal relationships and situations, which occur throughout this flick, only makes it that much more believable and thrilling.  Watch those trapped by the rising flames try to work their way to freedom often to a perilous end...and the grief and sorrow of loss that follows in the aftermath of the all consuming fire.  A highly recommended purchase, but buy the DVD, as the VHS does not have the quality of picture and sound you'll be satisfied with!

$REVIEW.: This movie kind of seems to hate women
From the neurotic main character, the crass best friend, to the unreasonable but ultimately loving mom, all the women in this movie are really hard to relate to


The men on the other hand are all handsome, kind and insightful with token superficial flaws

They try to imply complex relationships but in the arguments I always end up siding with the guys because the women "don't know what they want" (as stated by female protagonist)

I have to admit, it was genius giving the new love interest turrets so it wouldn't be socially unacceptable for him to move in on a widow
Though I love Nellie McKay, my girlfriend observed that it seemed like she was making fun of the movie
There were a lot weak rom-com cliches, and contrived drama when I was hoping for a movie that had the worst and best moments love has to offer

I feel like this movie at it's core had a lot of potential but it was just poorly executed.

$review_text.: &quot;Fright Night&quot; is a very fun, frightening tale about a boy, Charlie Brewster, played by William Ragsdale.(Remember, Herman's Head on Fox?)  His girlfriend, Amy, who he has been pressuring into having sex, is played by Amanda Bearse, who is probably best known as the annoying neighbor, Marcy, from Married with Children

 Suddenly Charlie is more interested in learning who his new neighbor is and not so interested in Amy.Stephen Geoffreys plays Evil Ed, with his annoying voice and his nerdy looks, he pretty much steals alot of the show with his antics.My favorite in this movie has to be Chris Sarandon, who plays Jerry Dandridge


He is the vampire, and he is very sexy
 A perfect choice for the role
 I also thought Roddy MacDowell was very good as the fearless vampire killer, in movies, but when it comes to real life he doesn't seem to have much faith.The story unravels as Charlie learns that Jerry is in fact and vampire
 He is trying to convince his friends that there is a vampire living next door

 and Roddy Macdowell enters when the friends are trying to convince Charlie that vampires don't exist.This movie works for me..it's fun to watch, and the special effects are decent


 The acting is by far much better than it is in most horror movies.If you like vampire movies and a bit of comedy mixed in, this is a good choice.

The director used a unique way of filming for the whole video; it was a very "live" look to the shots, and creative way of laying the guys singing and shots of Morocco.I also enjoyed the acoustic sound of Collctive Soul songs, it gives everything a different spin to some well loved, and often heard songs. Not to mention Ed Roland sounds pretty much the same singing here as he does for a "perfect conditions" music studio. That can't always be said for some artists, when they get outside of a music studio, into the rest of the world!And one last note; The guys of CS are really pretty funny to watch. They seemed to be very relaxed and appreciative of seeing another part of the world and way of living.

$review_text.: A squinty-eyed big armed sailor named Popeye (Robin Williams) arrives in a seaside town called Sweet Haven for a home and in search of his long lost Pappy (Ray Waltson)


There he meets a hamburger addicted man named Wimpy (Pauly Dooley) and a skinny woman named Olive Oyle (Shelly Devuall) who is the fiancee to town bully Bluto (Paul L

Smith), she falls for Popeye's charm and they also adapt a baby boy named SweetPea

Bluto wants to take his revenge on the town since Olive dumped Bluto as Popeye has many adventures especially in trying to find his father and stopping Bluto.Very entertaining and underrated live-action musical adaptation of the beloved comic strip character from director Robert Altman

Robin Williams and Shelly Devuall were perfect in the roles they were meant to play, i think this movie is faithful to some of the classic cartoons and comic strips

It does have a handful of nice musical tunes by Harry Nielsen especially "I'm Mean" and has a great playful sense of fun thanks to the excellent performance of Willaims as Popeye and the direction of Robert Altman.This DVD contains no extras at all and not even a trailer but does have a good widescreen transfer.

$review_text.: By 1967, enough was enough with the light fluff comedies starring Elvis Presley. Throughout the 60s, Elvis was being humiliated making bad movies like TICKLE ME and HARUM SCARUM while The Beatles and Bob Dylan were  changing the music scene.In SPEEDWAY, Elvis plays a singing race car  driver (for the third time!) who gets into trouble with the IRS. He falls  in love with Nancy Sinatra, and that's about it for the plot.The only  saving grace is that the cast is better than average. It's quite  interesting to see Elvis act alongside &quot;Lucy&quot; regular Gale  Gordon. The songs are a little better than average, especially the quite  good &quot;Let Yourself Go&quot;.Again, it's not that bad. It's a  definite improvement over CLAMBAKE, but a far cry from JAILHOUSE ROCK or  KING CREOLE.

$REVIEW.: I saw this film in a theater during its original run, years ago

 At the time, I wasn't much impressed

 Recently, I stumbled on this DVD version and decided to compare it with the classic 1952 original.Let me now be perfectly clear

 If you wish to retain any vestige of respect for this film, DO NOT view it in conjunction with the original!With the single exception of Gene Hackman (who at least struggles to make some bricks, despite an acute lack of straw), this remake is lame in every possible respect


 Every line of dialogue, every plot point, every set-up, every individual frame is not only inferior to the original but clearly designed to be so by the writers, technical staff, director and producer.The single-minded crumminess of this effort can only have arisen from some shared, manic delusion that they, each and all of them, were making improvements on the old film noir thriller
 Hooboy, were they wrong!How does this sort of thing happen?  Exactly why does someone who has chosen to spend millions of dollars on remaking a movie decide to scrap everything that was good in the original and replace it with intellectually and artistically shabby merchandise?  Why, in short, would anybody exchange a taut, tense little thriller on a train with a big, dumb, clumsy action flick that largely takes place ON TOP of a train?For those impressed by the scenery in which this locomotive catastrophe is imbedded, I feel obliged to report that I have taken that train on that very route


 The movie managed to muck that up, too.A waste of Gene Hackman
 A waste of Canadian scenery
 A waste of your time and money.

$REVIEW.: Back in 2002, Firefly was the promising new sci-fi show on Fox cursed with such a horrible string of bad executive decisions, it's a miracle how it managed to gain a dedicated following. The network insisted on various changes to the show; they aired episodes in a different order than its creators intended; they even cropped the picture to a 4:3 aspect ratio for TV, although it was meant to be shown in widescreen. No wonder it eventually got canceled halfway through the season with three more episodes made but never aired.All this, I've only learned recently, as with 2005 came the release of Serenity, the motion picture, which has lead a whole new bunch of us to discover this interesting world. Having seen the movie, I was aching for more. As luck would have it, this time there actually was more: this very DVD set, Firefly - The Complete Series.I'm happy to say that it has exceeded my expectations in every way. On its own, the untimely cancellation of the show make Firefly hard to recommend without any reservations. Couple it with Serenity, however, and they make a thoroughly excellent package together. With Firefly, you get 675 more minutes of the same great cast of characters and many more of their interesting adventures, although each understandably somewhat less grandiose than that of the movie.Even the bonus features are impeccable. Of the 14 episodes, exactly half of them got a commentary track, each with a different set of people. Four of the cast are featured at least one once: Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, Jewel Staite and Morena Baccarin. And of course, Joss Whedon, the brains behind the project, is along in three of them to share his thoughts. Beyond that, there's a gag reel, deleted scenes, behind the scenes features, and more.Really, the fact that this was released on 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, the same studio which so mistreated the show on TV, is no cause for concern. This DVD set does Firefly justice and treats it with the respect it always deserved.The bottom line is, you'll want to pick up both this and the Serenity DVD. That the two are unlikely to ever get officially bundled together is only because they were produced by different studios.

$review_text.: If you are familiar with Polanski's earlier artisticachievements and feel close to the way he reveals "the darkside" of human mind and spirituality, Polanski's very own realism, black comedy, slowly unfolding and buildup mystery and suspense, "psychedelics", if you watched and liked some of the films he made ("Knife in The Water", "Repulsion", "Cul-de-sac", "The Fearless Vampire Killers ", "Rosemary's Baby&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, "Chinatown", "The Tenant", "Tess", "Frantic"), you may also enjoy "Bitter Moon" ("Lunes de fiels").Interestingly, Polanski seems to have always been married to mysteriously beautiful women actresses, and cast them in his movies: the American Sharon Tate, whom he cast in the delicious spoof of vampire films "The Fearless Vampire Killers", and French Emmanuelle Segnier, who does very well next to Harrison Ford in "Frantic", Polanski's 1988 mystery-thriller set in Paris..  I admire Seigner (as I do other French actresses of her generation, such as Parillaud, Beart, Adjani), and. although I must admit, I have not yet watched the 1999 "The Ninth Gate", which is the very last film Polanski "made for her", I feel that "Bitter Moon" could very well be "her" movie.  I was less preoccupied with the exact details of the story, instead I was just fascinated with Seigner's performance.  Sober, "correct" English couple played by Hugh Grant - Kristin Scott-Thomas is there to emphasize by contrast, Emmanuelle Seigner's French character.Polanski captures the diversity and intricacies of a woman's mind: innocent youth, passionate love, total dedication to her partner, and then , when passion vanishes and there is no room for just a bit of friendship-companionship, what follows is emptiness, desolation, despair that leads to human degradation, and, in the end, tragedy.  Do not look just for the steamy lovemaking scenes - appreciate Seigner's character in its entirety !"Bitter Moon" is, definitely, not a masterpiece, and does not call for Academy Awards as was the case with "Chinatown" and "Tess", but I sense it is a good movie coming from Polanski, the artist who was born in Paris, lived and produced in Eastern Europe and France, then, for short time found himself across the ocean in Hollywood, and now is "back" in Paris.

What I didn't like was that it was not like Poseidon Warner Brothers came out with. It was a direct remake of the original. They only changed how the characters were in this version, also they had the kid brother and sister have parents, and the dad have a love affair. they also changed how the ship turned upside down, they used the idea of terrorist bombing the ship causing it to turn upside down(I thought that idea was dumb)

However, one area where innovation was used, for mere pretension, and no other reason, was the way the cinematographer photographed nearly EVERY SCENE


First, he refused to use a steady-cam, but bounced the camera around like a war correspondant pursued by bullets
The set decorator used Christmas lights covering the walls in almost EVERY scene

AA Meeting? USE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS! Old apartment used by the girlfriend and serial killer? MORE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS! Outside a building? Christmas lights
Now, "WHY" you may ask? Because almost EVERY SCENE was slowly faded in from extreme out of focus perspectives, so the lights looked like colored globes


THEN, you get the bobbing camera, until the scene is played

When the script ends, the scene FADES OUT with a slow SLOW return back OUT OF FOCUS


Finally, when only blobs of light remain, the camera pans to the floor, and the scene BLACKS OUT


NOW, believe it or not, that WAY-overused device was probibly one of the BETTER qualities of the film
THis is a slasher flick where NOBODY SCREAMS who dies...in fact, everybody just sort of whispers their lines

Watching some of the director's commentary, I found out that this is to be called "MUMBLE-CORE", and was very "post modern"


(I hate pretension

But to use it as a cover over badly planned and executed art, isn't even pretension, just pseudo-intellectualism.) THe writer said he spent A WEEK writing the script


Incredible
Did he spend that much time? THe writing is poor


Apparently there is suppose to be a THEME between the addiction of the girlfriend, and the way the serial killer was "addicted" to killing


Since serial killers are psychopaths by definition, they DONT feel dispair, except for maybe their own fall caused by some monsterous wounds inflicted on them during their childhood

BUT NOTHING is given about the serial killer's motives
 From what i could gather from the commentary i could stand listening too (extremely vulgar language consistantly used), there are only 3 or 4 professional actors in this whole film


Given the problems with the whole project, I think the acting was as good as the poor script could allow


 THis film was obviously LO BUDGET all the way


But that doesnt have to mean a low calibre film

Slasher flicks arent usually the highest cinematic art form, but this is film is DOA

Poor directing, bad script, horribe cinematography, random motives in several character's behaviors, along with slow pacing, and no point to the abstract content


About the only thing i can say, is that the film is bad in a WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY than any film I've seen before

No doubt elements of this film, could be good

Some of the editing was interesting, where scenes were assembled out of linear sequence


If the cinematographer's odd OUT OF FOCUS habits, and bouncy camera movements were restrained, or used in some viable context, his work might have interesting
Lots of the soundtrack, in its minimalistic fashion, were appropiately errie
There was an unexpected, mostly unbelievable, plot twist at the end of the film
(tho slasher films have that device as part of their form, dont they?) The overarching wierdness of the film's execution-- the out of focus, bouncing cinematography, the dreamlike sequencing,the slow pacing, the whispering lines the actors deliver--- displays an "ANTI-HOLLYWOOD" attitude, that prevents this from being a true ONE STAR film
Bits of a studied, film school quality, and youthful originality shine thru the film's overall slapdash execution


The D.I.Y

attitude, and the willingness to experiment, earns this film an extra star


But I just cant bring myself to like this film, no matter how hard i try.

$review_text.: After watching the dissappointing Clash of the Titans, I was a bit worried about watching Wrath, yet decided to give it a shot, good thing too. The story has some typical ancient Greek mythos- some hero/demigod decides to take a break from action and be "normal" and have  a family... until an offer comes up to help out with war, between gods and titans.Said hero, Perseus, the son of Zeus, doesn't want to. At all. Yet when his village is attacked after a disturbing vision, it seems that he'll have to join the cause. Along the way, he meets beautiful Sergeant Andromeda who has plenty of brains to go with her beauty, and together, with the son of Poseidon, Agenor, they journey to stop the father of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, Chronos, from fulfilling his wrath upon the world.Throughout the journey, the effects have been massively improved from the first to be much better, along with a more interesting story, full of more intriguing characters from Greek mythology, as well as settings, such as the living labyrinth. The story, itself, has more intelligence and personal pathos than Clash, as well as heartbreaking moments. The people and gods are more fleshed out than before, less cardboard cutouts.All this to say Wrath of the Titans has been a massive improvement over its very dissappointing predecessor.

$review_text.: For those who gripe about the extras being the exact same as the DVD Extended editions, there are a few blu ray easter eggs that were not included on the Standard DVD extended editions. On Blu Ray disk 2 of Fellowship, when navigating through the special features menu, as on disk 1, there is a ring icon. The first disk included the MTV parody which was already released. Blu Ray Disc 2 also has a ring icon and when you select it, Peter Jackson introduces the preview of Two Towers that showed exclusively with the Fellowship during its closing run while in theaters. Similar to the trailer, but a bit longer but without the "Preview" green band and title graphic at the end. Disk 2 of Two Towers Does not seem to have any extra ring in the special features menu. Disk 1 and 2 of Return of the King also have their own easter eggs.  So here they are:FOTR Disk 1 - MTV Spoof,  Disk 2 - sneak preview of Two Towers as seen in theaters at the end of the Fellowship runTTow Disk 1 - Special Award for Gollum  No Easter Egg on disk 2ROTK Disk 1 - Interview between Dominic M and Elijah Wood, Disk 2 - Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller propose a sequel to Peter Jackson.Some of these have been included before, I only know of one is a Blu Ray exclusive egg.

$review_text.: "The Pest" is, by far, one of my favorite comedy films.  It's so hilarious that you laugh the whole way through the film.  John Leguizamo is one of the funniest and genius commedians on the planet.  See this movie, and you'll know what I mean...Pest Vargas (Leguizamo) is the neighboorhood pest (Duh!).  He lives in the suburbs of Lantio Miami, Florida, were his job isn't working or trading...it's conning.  Being a master con-artist, he cons his way through the street of Miami, being anywhere from a Blind-card Tricker, to a Japanesee Business man.  While being constantly hunted by the Scottish Mafia (yes, there is one), Pest comes across a German Business man, who claims to give Pest $50,000 for College spendings, just for doing a few tests and visits.  But what Pest will find out, is that the Test...is to stay alive!  It turns out to be that the man is a Neo-Nazi and a manhunter, whom wants to hunt every enthnic color and post their head on his hunting shelf, like a stuffed animal!  If Pest stays alive for 24 hours, he gets the money.  But if he doesn't, its the shelf.  And so begins Pest's long and Hilarious escape from the Neo-Nazi, along with staying one foot ahead of the Scottish mob, while at the same time, trying to arive in time for dinner at his Girlfriend's house!  Pest's buddies, Chubby (Mad TV's Aries Spears) and Ninja (Freddy Rodr&iacute;guez) attempt to help Pest, while Pest's Girlfriend (Tammy Townsend) doesn't have a clue whats going on."The Pest" is on of the funniest movies of all time...

The color is just beautiful on it and it was done so very well. I really appreciate owning it now and getting to watch it whenever I choose. This is truly a timeless story - watching Crosby honor a WWII veteran - it's just nice to see the way things used to be in a simpler time, unaffected by the various occurrences today. It certainly would be nice to go back in time and have a holiday like this movie portrays. It's certainly romantic and something everyone should have as their holiday traditional movie watching!

$review_text.: Ratatouille (Brad Bird, 2007)In 1994, Pixar shot to the top of the American heap of animators with Toy Story. At the same time, the similarly placed giant of the Japanese animation industry, Studio Ghibli, started gaining American converts; a few years later, critics saw Princess Mononoke and realized that there might be something to this guy Hayao Miyazaki's directorial skills after all. Then came 2001, and each studio released its (to date) magnum opus; Pixar treated us to Monsters, Inc., while Ghibli unleashed Spirited Away, both of which are widely considered to be among the thousand or so finest movies ever made. There, their paths diverged. Ghibli, never known for being a factory, has released only a single movie since (Howl's Moving Castle), with its second in the period since slated for release in 2008. Pixar, on the other hand, who had previously followed a somewhat similar release schedule, started plowing them out like gangbusters. Pixar have released, on average, one full-length movie per year since 2003. Some studios can do that and not sacrifice the quality inherent in their previous stock. Pixar, as it turns out, was not one of them. Whereas Toy Story (and its sequel) and Monsters, Inc. are fantastic movies for all ages of viewer, the post-2001 material has become increasingly kid-centric. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing if your target audience is kids. But, as the makers of any number of kids'-movie flops in recent years (with 2006 a nadir) will lament, what does it matter if your target audience (a) can't drive and (b) has parents who cower in terror at the thought of seeing whatever it kids the kids are so all-fired excited about? The lowest point, for Pixar, came with last year's Cars; the only person I know who actually likes the movie was three years old when it came out.I don't know whether someone at Pixar realized that Ghibli was pulling away with amazing speed in the animation wars, or whether cooler heads finally prevailed, but Ratatouille is a long-awaited return to form--a Pixar movie that will enchant both kids and adults alike. Well, except for those who don't like rats. The story focuses on Remy (The King of Queens' Patton Oswalt), a highly intelligent rat who's obsessed with cooking. Through a series of misadventures, Remy hooks up with Linguini (Pixar regular Lou Romano), a janitor at the restaurant of the chef Remy idolizes, and Remy finds his opportunity to become a world-class chef with Linguini acting as his hands. A simple plot, as in the best Pixar movies, rapidly spirals out of control into something Corinthian in its complexity, while the visuals provide a feast of amusing details that show there's a brilliant mind at work behind the controls. Bird, responsible for the decent-but-nothing-special The Incredibles a few years ago, finally lives up to the promise he showed with The Iron Giant. This is the kind of stuff Pixar is capable of putting out when it brings it's a game, and it's wonderful to see Pixar bringing it's a game again. ****
$SUMMARY.: Welcome back, Pixar!

$REVIEW.: I am a huge Adam Sandler fan, so of course I like this movie.  But its on the lower half of the list.  First, because Drew Barrymore's acting bothering the crap out of me, which I guess is sort of the fault of the character.  But also, Sandler was kind of indirectly pompous, which he does not do well.  He should either be totally full of himself, or completely humble.  I don't know if this was the character, or the way he played the character, or the script, but it bothered me.  They were both way too sweet, which I guess was the point, but it the kind of sweet where it makes you want to punch them with a hammer.But over all, its definately funny and cute and I like it.

For crying out loud it's only 45 minutes, bairly qualifies as an animated short.The story for this feature revolves around 2 scientist who pursue, study and eventually exterminate specific specimines of this organism called the Demon Virus.  Much like cancer it spreads throughout the body killing the host, however the tumors that they look like are these deformed looking faces that are very vicouse (as seen in the beggining).  One fo the scientist however has the Demon Virus in him yet due to his incredibly powerful immune system he can control the virus and transform into this weird looking werewolf bug thingy.  Eventually they hunt down a host who is to be the next prime minister and has a taste for beutiful young women flesh and liver.This is one of those animes that are for diehard fans only.  If you are just starting to get into the stuff I recommend watching either Akira, Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, or Vampire Hunter D.  Hold off on this if you are just getting started.

$REVIEW.: I got this because the video box photo and liner notes made it look like a comedy starring John Cleese.  It's neither.  It took a long time to gel into a disappointingly predictable plot.  The only thing that saved it was the unexpected attack scene toward the end--unexpected mostly because I was misled into thinking this was a slapstick farce instead of a mediocre drama with some funny bits. They did nothing with the "intelligence" officer except use him as a foil for Denis Quilley's character (which wasn't necessary) and a badly focused romantic interest.  They could have used him to add some intrigue.  Likewise, they totally wasted the Mata Hari-like female lead.  It was as if the writers just didn't want to do anything to awful to all these nice people, for fear that the viewers wouldn't have enough sympathy for them when they were attacked.  Even the evil one gets away.  And the feel-good ending feels too...good.Though I didn't think it was a great movie, I did find the characters easy to like, and the musical numbers were well done and funny.And I can't fault John Cleese's performance.  He plays the "God-King-Country" bit to the hilt, but not for laughs, and I liked that.  He comes across as an idealistic but clueless bit of military deadwood, which is exactly what that character should be.  Likewise, Denis Quilley nailed his character perfectly.

Unforgiven is one of those movies that really deserves 5 stars among thousands that get it but don't deserve it

It deserved Best Picture of 1992 and rightfully got it.In my recent review of this year's (2006) horror slugfest Slither, I asked what ranking those who gave it 5 stars would then give a real 5-star movie like Unforgiven


Here's some email feedback I got (colorful at times):Someone said, "Well you gave 5 stars to Justice League, Bugs Bunny and Tales From The Crypt." And I responded,  "Those weren't movies." And someone else said, "Well Slither was 5 stars 'in its genre.'" And I said, "Okay

That's fair...I guess...as long as the reader knows that your system is broken out by genre." And the next guy said, "Who are you to say what's 5 stars and what's not?" And I said, "Excellent point
Everyone's entitled to their own opinion."I could ramble on and debate this all day.You see, therefore, in my humble opinion, Unforgiven is just one of those movies that has to make you question your own judgment on what you classify as "the best"; it makes you Monday-morning-quarterback your decision to give a five star rating to some movie that simply put you in a good mood for the weekend versus the next one that came along that really deserved 5 stars.Somewhere out there back in 1992, a reviewer's system was foiled that topped out at 4 stars


That reviewer finally gave in and added a fifth star to his system for Unforgiven

He upgraded a few pre-1992 movie's like Goodfellas and Silence of the Lambs with his new 5-star rating

But that silly reviewer is probably up to 10 stars by now in his system
So exemplifies the vicious cycle that we surely all want to avoid.So I suggest this, fair reviewers: Lest we not be so liberal with our stars so we don't end up needing to add more stars to the point system in order to do justice to the movies that should stand alone at the top.Unforgiven is definitely one of them.

$review_text.: Now that's a question you can discuss all night. As far as make-up, nobody will ever surpass Lon Chaney's Quasimodo. Ever. He is, to every detail, the Quasimodo described in Hugo's book. As far as the performances, both have more than their share of pathos and emotion, but, even as a diehard Chaney fan, I have the give the slight edge to Laughton, though he did, remember, have the benefit of sound; Lon did not, and he still made your eyes fill up more than once. Laughton turns in one of his finest portrayals here, one that stays with you. He also provides several teary moments, most notably the final line. (and SHAME on you reviewers who gave it away! You robbed a new viewer of one of the most emotional moments on film) The rest of the cast is very good to competent, the phtotgraphy superb, and as a whole, the film holds up remarkably well. A must-own, along with Chaney's version, of course. Interestingly, neither the Chaney or Laughton versions stick to the book insofar as the endings went. The inferior Anthony Quinn version, however, did.

$review_text.: The acting is not great if stilted. Many buy this film knowing of its sadistic climax. Its why they buy it. In this way the movie is like a cheap porn flick for kicks, which is sad to denigrate the sadistic suffering of others with nothing to express about how or why or give us some character detail to show motivation. In this respect the characters were childish even the adults. That is what is cheap and sad is that this isn't a particularly sick film out side of its blow torch shocker as an idea. What is sick is how remarkably well she is considering the burns that she's suffered. No surprises there when people are shot like so much pop corn even if there shoud be grieving mothers out of sight. Or hangings Lets hope no ones committed suicide because it looks like falling asleep every time on screen. In fact eyes bulge horribly, tongue turns black and a hidiously commical expression. Poor solitary nasty brutish and way too slow a way to go.Ditto this American bimbos circumcision.Save your time and $ away from this cheap shot.

$review_text.: Though Robert Louis Stevenson's name is credited, Roger Corman-produced 'The Suicide Club' is different from the original short story by the author.  That doesn't mean that this film (not made-for-TV one) doesn't deserve our time.  The intriguing premises of Stevenson is left intact, and the photography is surprisingly beautiful, considering the low-budget origin.  And you can see Paul Bettany (credited in the third place), which is really something.The film is about a sad and lonely man Captain Henry Joyce (David Morrissey), who, distraught after one tragic event,  rather rashly joins in the secret club presided by one 'Bourne' (Jonathan Pryce).  By night, the club members gather at Bourne's house, and play a deadly game by drawing a card, which determines the one who kills, and the one gets killed.Things get complicated soon.  One of the members happens to be a yonug lady named Sarah, with whom Henry eventually falls in love.  Now Henry finds a new meaning in his life, but it's too late for him for once he signed a contract with Bourne, there is no turning back from the club's rules except his own demise.[SHOT IN IRELAND]  Though the original story is set in London, Iraland stands in for the location for this film, and the results are satisfactory.  The film obviously lacks in money at certain points (like costumes), but Rachel Samuels handles the camera very well, not to remind us of the next-to-nothing budget.  Plus, presence of villainous Jonathan Pryce with his usual gentlemanly smile adds 'class' to the entire film.But for all its merits, the fact that the film was shot very, very fast cannot be concealed.  Some parts of the film lack logical construction of story (especially the ending part, which really needs re-shooting), and if you are aware of the strict rules of real 'clubs' in England, you find it hard to believe in the incredible membership of a lady in this male-dominated culture -- and it's a suicide club, in particular.The film offers some fun with its good, melodramatic story, but the material is raw, and the efcects are half-baked, even though with good acting from Pryce and Bettany.  As is always with the case with Corman's films, 'The Suicide Club' has brilliant idea at its core, and and also decent acting (from some actors (if not all), but still remains a so-so produciton because of its underfinaced budget and awfully hasty editing.

$REVIEW.: "The Shootist" is one of John Wayne's finest performance, filled with the irony of life imitating art and vice versa, since the Duke and his character in "The Shootist" both knew they were facing death. The cast is replete with heroes from TV and movie westerns, and features great performances by Jimmy Stewart as Doc Hostetler, Lauren Bacall as the widow Rogers, the Duke's would-be love interest, and Ron Howard as Gillam Rogers, the widow's eager teenage son who is coming into manhood.Wayne plays John Bernard Books, an infamous gunfighter and frontiersman who defines the persona of the rugged Westerner. He comes to Carson City, Nevada to seek out the diagnosis of the only doctor he's ever trusted, Doc Hostetler. The two Hollywood legends play out a classic scene of humor, respect, and finality between two old friends. His worst fears confirmed, Books seeks out a place to play out his final act.He takes a room at the widow Roger's boarding house, and a night doesn't go by before Book's condition becomes the talk of the town, and killers try to dispatch him in the middle of the night. Appalled and frightened by Book's coarse manner and infamous reputation, Bacall's character calls upon Henry Morgan as the town's chatty sheriff Tibodeaux, to throw the Duke out into the street, before all of her boarders move out. And this is where the unique performance by Wayne and the story begins to take shape.Wayne becomes a surrogate father to Gillam and tries to impart his wisdom and guidance on the impressionable young man. And Book's plan to meet his fate begins to unfold. The movie includes classic villian portrayals by Richard Boone, Bill Kenney, and Edmund O'Brien. There are also terrific cameos by John Carradine as the undertaker and Sheree North as Book's long lost love.The beauty of "The Shootist" is that it relies entirely on the strength of the actor's performances and the plot turns of the story. It is a beautifully poignant tribute to the American Western that examines the end of the West as these characters have lived it. It hints at a country ready to trade in the untamed frontier for the progressive evolution of the country as it stands poised to enter the 20th Century.Books and the other characters in "The Shootist" provide one last great hurrah to celebrate what made the taming of the American West such a profound and enduring tradition in American film making. This cast of Hollywood greats and legends show us why they are revered as giants in the film industry.

$REVIEW.: I wasn't expecting much from the "The Omen", after the recent onslaught of Hollywood horror re-treads like "The Fog", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Hills Have Eyes", I had my expectations set kind of low. To be honest "The Omen" isn't bad. They have updated the story so that we now get references to 9/11, Hurricane Katrina etc. But overall the story is exactly the same as the 1970's version. And while that can be considered a good thing to some, it ultimately makes the new "Omen" worthless. This movie has already been done, and done well. There are some good parts to the remake, like Mia Farrow's character Mrs. Baylock, the decapitation scene was cool, but overall there really wasn't much worth watching this movie for over the original.

$review_text.: ARMY OF DARKNESS is the third entry in Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD TRILOGY. It is a great comedy that mixes genres and has some of the best one liners in cinema history. This BOOMSTICK EDITION is the 1,000 time the film has been on DVD and is the definitive version. Here are the bonus materials:-Director's Cut: Along with the original theatrical version is the director's cut which runs 15 minutes longer. Of the two, I prefer the theatrical version. Although I love the alternate ending in the director's cut, I think the humor in the theatrical ending is more in tune with the rest of the film. The other added scenes are good but the final battle now goes on far too long with there being long periods of no laughs or even interesting action.-Commentary (only on director's cut): By Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Ivan Raimi. A very funny and informative track.-Featurette: A good featurette that goes into the makeup and monster FX of the movie. Although it would've been better as a full documentary.-Deleted Scenes (with optional commentary): Some good scenes that should've been in the director's cut but might've brought down the pace of the film.-Storyboards: You can view the director's storyboards as you watch the film.-Photo Gallery: Concepts of the monsters.-Trailer: A very funny trailer.Also included is a booklet written by Bruce Campbell, making this one of the best horror/cult movie releases on DVD.

$review_text.: A somewhat bizarre Depression-era political drama, which transforms the Capra-style populist comedy into a grim, protofascist litany
And I don't use the term "fascist" lightly -- it's meant quite literally


Walter Huston stars as Judson Hammond, a newly elected Republican President, appropriately cynical and snugly placed in the pockets of big business, who faces the same challenges as Roosevelt did in '32, namely, the continuing misery of the Great Depression and the disaffection and anger of millions of working class poor

Hammond has no intention of meeting any of his lofty campaign promises, and sees the Presidency itself as a bit of a lark

An ardent isolationist, he even jeers at the congratulatory telegrams sent to him by other world leaders ("Siam? Where's that?" he asks, in an early scene, prompting an easy comparison to our own geographically-challenged G.W
Bush, back in the days of the 2000 campaign...)Everything changes, however, when Hammond has an automobile-related brush with death, and comes back from the brink with a newfound commitment to saving his fellow man
Initially his impulses are markedly Rooseveltian -- he asks Congress to authorize a gigantic public works program to get the working poor back on their feet, and fires any of his old cronies who object


Faced with a backlash from his own party, and legislative opposition in Congress, he counters the accusation that he seeks to become a tyrant by embracing the idea, claiming that a benevolent dictatorship is more moral than neglecting the interests of "the People." Later, as he confronts an ongoing wave of gangster-related violence, Hammond takes a can-do attitude, and annihilates a Mob boss who won't buckle under..


The scene in which the criminal kingpin is sentenced to die is spectacularly fascistic: Hammond's aide-de-camp (played by an under-used Franchot Tone), dressed in a gleaming military outfit, sits behind a huge Greco-Roman, art deco tribunal bench, and ardently praises Hammond's ability to "cut through the red tape of legal procedures and get back to the first principles -- an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life." Finally, Hammond uses a gigantic display of American military power to blackmail and intimidate the other nations into disarming, summoning an apocalyptic (and sadly, somewhat prophetic) vision of the horrors that await the world if the arms race should continue.The film is quite remarkable in its outright emulation of fascistic, authoritarian politics, and is unlike practically any other American political film of the era (which were much more prone to upholding the nation's fundamental democratic ideals)


Still, it does capture the zeitgeist of the times -- the anxiety and desperation, the urge to find stability and salvation, and the fear of a renewed global war -- it just comes down on a side which didn't get much credence on this side of the Atlantic


Admittedly, this film is a dramatic failure -- for one thing, Huston was a horrid actor; and secondly the script is a bit brusque, talky and shrill -- but historically speaking, it's a fascinating document and deserves consideration in that regard
Those who see it as a parable for the New Deal are sadly mistaken, however -- I think the film's creators may have been far more enamored of Mussolini than they were of good old FDR, who actually did pull us back from the brink.

This film is for the "romantics" at heart who would like to be spared the bedroom scenes, the profanity and the nudity

The story, as the name imples is an adjusted knock off from the story "Beauty and the Beast" however the setting is more contemporary.Eric comes across initially as a rude and arrogant man, who buries himself in his work to cover the pain of his past loss


Belle's father, because of a careless accident causes Belle to be forced to work for Eric.Over a period to time, like all things, a fondness starts to develop between Eric and Belle
The plot in this film is not very thick, so to inspire some excitement Belle's young admirer is used to bring in some intrigue.This is not a big budget film, but it does carry a sweet message: Love conquers all.

$REVIEW.: Whether they intended to make another Halloween film after Halloween H20 or not is irrelevant at this point. H20 gave the series a satisfying ending that few other endless slasher series ever attempt - its unkillable killer is truly killed once and for all. But they went and ruined that rare, cherished finality anyway and made Halloween: Resurrection.We now find Laurie Strode locked away in a psychiatric hospital. Why? Because before she could lop off the head of her evil brother, Michael Myers, the ever-clever "Boogeyman" managed to pull a switcheroo. Choking out a paramedic and swapping clothes, Michael disappeared into the California night, leaving the poor paramedic to meet the business end of Laurie's home run swing with the fireman's axe. Guilt-ridden that she had killed an innocent man, Laurie goes crazy and is committed. But this turns out to be a ruse, as Laurie has set a trap that was apparently approved by Wile E. Coyote, intently lying in wait for Michael to come for her once again. And indeed he does, and after a brief chase, Laurie is finally slain.The story shifts back to Haddonfield, Illinois, Michael's hometown. The old Myers house, still abandoned, has become the setting of a reality show produced by internet mogul Busta Rhymes (more on him later). Busta Bust picks a handful of attention whore college kids to explore the condemned Myers house on Halloween night, giving them each a wireless camera to film their activities as the footage is streamed live over the World Wide Web. At one point, the kids even reference The Osbournes in the dialogue. You can literally feel the desperation to make this film relatable to modern teen audiences.Well Michael Myers comes home again, and isn't too happy to find these intruders in his crib. The young Flip Mode Squad recruits start dying one by one as internet audiences watch, uncertain if what they're watching is real or a hoax. But I guess that even a shark in the white mask and baggy-ass overalls is no match for Busta's mad kung-fu skillz. He's straight gangsta, yo.While the Rear Window-esque voyeur element is rather inspired, nothing else in the film really is. The original Scream Queen is uncerimoniously eliminated in the first ten minutes of the film, leaving the audience with no one but a group of dumb, horny, weed-smoking, stereotypical college kids and a kung-fu kicking Busta Rhymes to deal with. If Halloween didn't jump the shark before (And how couldn't it have after EIGHT installments?), then it certainly did once Busta kicks Michael through a window. It's up there with Indiana Jones surviving a nulcear blast by hiding in a fridge with god-awful, laughably absurd moments in film. And we gave up the emotional closure of Laurie triumphing over Michael at the end of Halloween H20 for this?Even diehard Halloween fans like myself try to pretend that Halloween: Resurrection never happened. If they wanted to make the franchise "hip" and relatable to today's younger audiences, I honestly wish they had given the franchise to Rob Zombie sooner if it meant avoided this embarrassing film's creation. At least the classic Halloween storyline would have ended with dignity.

$REVIEW.: This movie isn't just about cancer and making it funny, or not. It's about a purpose in life, about the people and relationships we fill it with. It's about making meaningful actions but accepting the human struggles we all experience. As much as this is Mr. Levitt's journey, perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this film is seeing the complex 3 dimensional ways that his cancer impacts everyone around him, especially Seth Rogen's character. Infused with the awkward and painful comedy of our current era (Forgetting Sarah Marshall & Funny People; Though 50/50 is much more accessible than the latter) that brings the comedy out of everyday truth, this tale is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. In that way, I find it to be a masterful representation of life. I take a voyeuristic approach to movies emotionally, and I love when a film can not only show you, but allow you experience those things that you don't get to experience in your everyday life, but teach you something about yourself, leaving you with a takeaway for your own life. I think it's important to face our own mortality, though it's preferable to do so before we're all invariably forced to. It's a beautiful film. Please see it.

$REVIEW.: Evil Dead 2 was a good movie especially since this is the first one I have ever seen.  I thought it was a strange movie some parts seemed funny then other parts seemed to be very serious or very scary.  So it is in a way a very confusing movie.  However just like Beetlejuice it uses the infamous claymation.  I love claymation I wished they would still use it in some movies.  Evil Dead 2 was released in 1987 and did well at the box office.  At the end of the movie it lead us into the third movie Army of Darkness.  I recommend this movie.

$REVIEW.: (Note: I will update this when I get the Blu-ray).The Bourne movie franchise has made quite the name for itself

In the hands of Doug Liman, he not only managed to introduce an interesting character with a lot of mystery and intrigue to his background, but also a character we were able to sympathize for
He was a character that lost his memory, re-discovered himself, then tried to leave his dark past behind and escape a corrupt system
After Paul Greengrass took the reigns, he improved what Liman left on the table, further exposing the humanistic side of this character as we see him lose the part of his life he cares about the most
But despite that loss, his humanity would prove to be stronger than his vengeance, as even more memories start to surface, making his journey for revenge turn into a search for redemption


And after finding his inner peace, he takes pursuit of those responsible in an effort to destroy the very system that had created him and brought about so much pain and suffering, not only to him, but many of those involved throughout its history


At this point, I think it's safe to say that Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne has really cemented itself amongst the iconic spy heroes (next to James Bond and maybe Bryan Mills from Taken)


Actually, for a while Universal Studios had been negotiating another Bourne movie with Damon, but he said he'd only take the role if Greengrass was directing
The two of them had signed on for something, at the very least, but things never fell through for another sequel, and the tandem would go on to make Green Zone (a pretty engaging military conspiracy thriller in itself, but that's for another review).Instead of Damon and Greengrass doing another Jason Bourne entry, we have something of a spinoff

The Bourne Legacy was written by Eric Van Lustbader and merely inspired by Robert Ludlum's work, so I guess you can't say there's really a "direct" correlation in terms of source material deviation

On the other hand, this new entry was written and directed by Tony Gilroy who wrote the screenplays for the first 3 films, wrote/directed Michael Clayton, and wrote the story for State of Play (both being excellent thrillers in their own right)


He also wrote/directed Duplicity, which I guess could technically fall under the thriller genre, but the romantic comedy elements made it feel like something else entirely

So how did Gilroy's third directing project go?The story begins in the snowy mountains of Alaska where Outcome agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is undergoing survival training


Meanwhile, news of Blackbriar's demise and the controversy surrounding it have forced Outcome's director Eric Byer (Edward Norton) into action after evidence had surfaced linking the founders of both Treadstone/Blackbriar and Outcome together
In an effort to stop this trail from leading back to them, Byer decides to shut the program down and burn it to the ground, eliminating any and all personnel involved
When a scientist for the program, Dr
Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), witnesses the murder of her colleagues, she and Cross become the remaining loose ends and must survive on the run to discover the answers behind the conspiracy.My favorite thing about the movie is its maintaining of realism
Just like how cool it was for Bourne to escape every situation by a hair's breadth or for him to set up the ultimate of break-ins and steal something vital, I'd say this was about as realistic as what was shown in Greengrass' films

Not "realistic" in the sense of believability, per se, but in the sense of how things could work out


The element of improvisation is still there in Cross, and while his end results may not be as flashy as when Bourne is outsmarting or outwitting an entire task force, many of Cross' scenes are still entertaining to watch
And a lot of it has to do with Renner's performance


The character he portrays isn't nearly as mysterious as Damon's originally was, but it's a very likeable one
This is only the 4th movie I've ever seen him in (the others being The Hurt Locker, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, and The Avengers), but it's really the only other starring role I've seen him do, and I think he does a great job


He has a good amount of charisma and enough ferocity in his action sequences to be revered and feared, and depending on where they go after this, I hope he really gets a chance to shine like Damon did as Bourne.I also love that they got Edward Norton to play the antagonist

He's a brilliant actor to begin with, and to see him as something of a villain was a real treat

He's always had a natural ability to take command on screen, and his role as Byer is no exception


Pretty much any time he's talking, it's hard not to pay attention to him, even if the other characters on screen with him are of a higher rank


His performance feels very intelligent and shadowy enough, but I was hoping the story would've allowed for him to show a meaner side every now and then

It's a very convincing role, and again, if they end up making a sequel I would love for him to return and hope that they write even more opportunities for him to become a well-developed character.And finally, I thought the scientific approach to the black ops program was a nice touch


Jason Bourne was more about the personal side of a cold-blooded assassin re-discovering his humanity and atoning for all the people he killed, which, symbolically, makes for great cinema


But the explanation on how he became so skilled in everything was just a given
We're to assume he's just good at what he does, and that's that
Here, the capabilities of an agent are, perhaps, less cool to think about in terms of "yeah, he kicks ass," just because he can
Aaron Cross seems more like he has the knowledge of things, but the lack of extreme force makes the overall tone of everything he does seem more down-to-earth

Although, I guess a lot of it has to do with the cinematography and editing as well (most of the trademark Greengrass shaky-cam is gone this time around)

All in all, it feels nice to know where some of these talents and skills are coming from.Now on to the actual movie
It's slow, but fast

I know that's a weird way to describe it, but it really is

When I say "slow," I mean the pacing is at about the same speed as The Bourne Identity

Throughout the film, you're given pieces of the plot, the occasional flashback to fill in some of the gaps or to develop Cross, and it all slowly builds towards a climax

And when I say "fast," I mean that I was so engrossed in trying to fit the pieces together, by the time I knew it, the movie was over
It's odd that for barely over 2 hours I was really wanting to know more about Cross' and Byer's pasts, what the true scope and reach of the genetic engineering project was, and just how many of these black ops programs really existed
And then there was this big chase sequence at the end, and it was done
I will say that if you go into this expecting a similar style to Identity, you'll be disappointed


The amnesia thing for Bourne was unique and his working backwards to find the truth was even more so
It was a plot of mystery and intrigue that was kind of pre-established already and Bourne just had to pick up the pieces

That's not the case here with Cross.As a character, the flashbacks work as a device to build him, slowly and thoroughly, but he already knows who he is


I firmly believe that if this film is financially successful enough that they'll continue to try and develop his character forwards, instead of backwards

I think that if they're smart enough to write a good story arc for his character, they'll include more and more flashbacks working their way up to a realization of what he can or does become
And to achieve this, I'm a little on the fence about the inclusion of Shearing
As talented as Weisz is, her character felt a tad over-reactive and panicky at times, which added a little too much of a "damsel in distress" quality to the rest of the film (i.e
makes her look weak)

I suppose it makes sense to mimic the male-female coupling for the search of truth so they can rely on one-another


But like Franka Potente said about playing Marie, her character wasn't as clich&eacute; and the chemistry between Bourne and her was purposely sporadic


I just hope the relationship between Cross and Shearing doesn't become too melodramatic at some point
Then again, they could always kill her, too.Picture-wise, I saw this on a digital projector at my local Cinemark

The movie itself was shot on 35mm and processed digitally and looks pretty spectacular

As much as I loved the documentary shaky-cam aesthetic Greengrass employed in his films, the one drawback to it was that the picture never really stayed still long enough for you to just look at something in a still frame and enjoy it, aside from the occasional scenic overhead shot of a city that lasted for all but 2 or 3 seconds until it zoomed in and cut to the next shaky shot
Here, Robert Elswit's photography has a much wider lens view, and yes, more static shots


Elswit also worked on Mission Impossible 4, which also starred Renner, ironically, and I think that may have influenced the wider shots after working with the IMAX cameras for that one
In terms of editing, the task is performed by Tony's brother John, and is also a lot less kinetic
Closeup shots are used about as much as they had been in the other Bourne films since the dialogue is so important, but I like that even without the quick cuts during action sequences, it sacrifices intensity for appreciation of the actual choreography


For the stunts, they brought back Dan Bradley who directed all the stunt work in the previous films, and the fights were coordinated by Jonathan Eusebio who was an assistant in the fights of Ultimatum and the lead choreographer for Haywire (really love the fights in that movie).Music-wise, James Newton Howard takes over for John Powell


I will stress that I absolutely loved Powell's work for the first 3 movies and that Bourne's main theme and the pulsating drums of his action pieces are one of the best sounds I've heard for any action movie outside of Hans Zimmer


Howard doesn't quite capture the same essence, but again, this is a completely different cast of characters

Thematically, he does manage to sneak in a little bit of Bourne's theme into some of his pieces, but only faintly and probably as a reminder that this movie is part of the franchise
The overall sound, however, is a lot more contemporary and even has some electric guitar in it


The more upbeat percussionist pieces used for the action sequences also carry a similar beat akin to Powell's, though are a little more variant with other instruments around it

In listening to the soundtrack, there doesn't seem to be a central theme or motif within any one piece to represent Cross' character, which is a little disappointing

As a whole, though, the score makes for great ambiance


And hopefully, if any sequels are made and become more action-packed, Howard will reach into his bag for some more up-tempo tricks.Overall, my expectations weren't set too high, but I was pleasantly surprised at this new character

The story has less mystery and intrigue, but instead a more linear approach to it, with Jason Bourne only being a reference point


The "Legacy" is more so about the super-soldier learning to think for himself and bailing a corrupted system as per Bourne's example

Even Greengrass stated in his commentaries that the villains weren't really bad guys, they were just part of a bad system


And with the potential to take the franchise in, hopefully, a newer, even fresher direction with Aaron Cross, something will come of it, be it Gilroy returning to write, direct, or whatever


Nowhere left to go now, but forward.Overall: 3.5 / 5.0

$review_text.: You don't often see a film that makes you want to stand up in your living room and start applauding.  SEVEN SAMURAI is, bar none, one of the greatest films I have ever seen.  From the film's captivating opening, to its in-depth character studies, from its magnificent battle sequences, to its emotional ending, this film is perfect from start to finish.  "Perfect" is not a word that I like to throw around that often, but SEVEN SAMURAI deserves it: what flaws there are in this picture are so massively outweighed by the film's achievements that they render them innocuous.What can one say about a film that has been commented on so thoroughly?  I will only bring up one theme in the film that peaked my interest.  While others have commented on the film's portrayal of duty versus love, I would like to mention the film's endorsement of some form of humanism, weak as it may be (particularly in a film that is supposed to be a period piece of 16th century Japan).  While I traditionally think of "samurai" films depicting traditional values, such as honor and just revenge, this film takes a detour from such themes.  We see the leader of the samurai turn his back on the villagers when they exact their just revenge on a captured bandit.  "He's a prisoner-of-war, he has begged for mercy, we can't kill him," shouts the leader.  But his words, surprisingly modern, fall upon deaf ears.  We also see a classic "class" struggle in the film, when one of the samurai falls for the daughter of a peasant farmer.  While it may be just a subtle voice in the film, Kurosawa manages to weave it in amidst the traditional values, suggesting a departure from traditional ways and thinking.Two other things warrant mentioning.  First of all, the character development in this film is remarkable.  Don't get hung up on the subtitles: we all know how much is really communicated with body language anyway.  You won't have trouble following these characters, even with their complexity.  Kurosawa has not delivered us a story of a virtuous village, protected by virtuous samurai, who are brutally assaulted by vicious bandits.  There are few cardboard characters in SEVEN SAMURAI.  Instead, we have a village full of self-interested, greedy, and cowardly persons.  Some are kind, some are not.  Our samurai are not spotless either.  They, too, are searching for peace and their home.The second thing worth mentioning is Kurosawa's skill behind the lens: he really knows how to get his shot.  From his marvelous deep-focus shots, to his great sense of pacing (the battle sequence is one of the best "cut" shots I've ever seen).  Everything in the film is paced correctly leading up to the climax of the film.  The B&W; is beautiful and this DVD transfer does it justice.If you haven't seen SEVEN SAMURAI, then you are truly missing something.  After watching this movie, you get the sense of how everything after this film had to respond to it in some way.  You'll never look at Westerns the same way again.  This is great storytelling, great characters, and great filmmaking all rolled into one.  Buy it today.  It is worth every penny.
$SUMMARY.: Spellbinding: You Owe It to Yourself to Watch this Film.

She was found in the water but clearly did not lose all of her blood there.  There are two men she was seeing, a married middle-aged cardiologist and a young oyster shucker bartender.  She dumped the later and was still seeing the former at the time she died.The usual cast of characters has to figure this out.  The older male detective has an expectant wife so is driving everyone crazy finding the derivation of names for babies.  The younger detective, assigned to Meghan's office, is admired by a new forensics tech who is in turn admired by the young nerdy doctor working for Meghan.  His big (literally) buddy and he, when out on the job, are the funniest part of the show.There is continual unraveling of the personal lives as well which reaches a conclusion as to one facet...and I was very glad to see that story arc come to an end.

$review_text.: I read the other reviews and am left wondering if I was watching the same movie.  Close was so ridiculously not a woman that reality had to be suspended  similarly to watching males act as females in Shakespeare.  Close performance mimicked Cloris Leachman's in Young Frankenstein. I expected to hear horses neighing in the background; ridiculous, to the point of being almost funny, it was pathetically bad. Perhaps I would have bought it but for the fact that Janet McTear carried off her disguise as a female so incredibly well.  She should be given the accolades.  Her performance was not absurd.  Perhaps Close' performance, being so outrageously fake, concealed McTear's true sexual identity more, but I think the writers and directors were not that smart. I guess Glenn Close can get away with anything these days; even this unbelievable performance.  McTear's part in this movie was perhaps not large enough to be awarded, but she saved a movie nearly wrecked by the "star". So I gave it two stars for her good work.  If she had had the lead, perhaps it would have warranted the 4 star rating.
$SUMMARY.: Mctear carried it off; Close was not close.

$review_text.: America, I mean the United States of America are changing sides, from Hollywood to Bollywood
They have to answer that unfair competition from the deprived Indians and go directly on their turf, since we can't really speak of a lawn, and bring the biblical truth to those pagans
That's what I found most fascinating at first: the image of the USA seen through the filter of Mumbai
First, make some simple questions fuzzy and difficult to capture
Moslems and Hindus are sure there but we don't know who is who


They speak the same language

No more difference really between Urdu and Hindi


Only the names of the main characters sound Moslem, that's all and the anti-Moslem pogrom or riot is just an unclear detail, especially since the dregs of this society are them, the Moslems


First serious blurred issue


The second is of course the problem of the Untouchables, the Dalits
They cannot be Moslems since they are a Hindu caste


And sure enough our characters who are living in the "slums" or shantytown, on the pile of garbage, are not Hindus, hence are not Untouchables
Then we are surprised because taking care of toilets is one of the tasks of these untouchables, or doing the washing for the fortunate who can afford that kind of service


So where are they? Invisible of course, but not in a city like Mumbai where there must be several millions of them
The episode of the little kid jumping into the toilet hole is just unthinkable for a Moslem child


If we go on with that fuzziness, we find out that the orphanage must be on the side of evil, since exploiting the Moslem orphans, hence Hindu


And the gangster who recuperates one of the boys when they are running away from the orphanage people after saving the girl and killing the main organizer of that begging and whoring ring, since he defines himself as the friend of the enemy of his enemies, must be Moslem
All that is unclear and that is done on purpose and it keeps some ambiguity about the Moslems in India without giving the slightest real knowledge about the real situation in India

But then of course we can speak of India itself and of its emergence from the mud-pit of the world

The picture that is given there is this time a reflection of and on what the West was fifty years ago, and some will say still are


Anything is good for these super poor people to do something to improve their lot, essentially by using any kind of opportunity that comes along that is half honest and half dishonest, like borrowing something that has been left somewhere like shoes at the entrance of a temple, but with the firm intention of not bringing them back and of making them circulate further for a little profit


This great poverty is not at all nurturing resignation but all the opposite, determination and the will to gamble everything to get up at least one step if not two


The film is entirely centered on a TV game, Questions and Answers that can lead the winner to 20 million Rupees
A game of punctual knowledge for a lot of money and nothing else

And yet out of that game popular fame is produced, the conviction that you can never keep people down longer than they will decide, that the survival instinct is nothing because it leads to killing, but the instinct to improve one's lot is a lot more stronger because it is supposed to lead to improving your lot in society itself
Then the story is of course a comedy because of the love affair that is intertwined and entangled in that story and the rewriting of Stephen King's "Running Man" (with Schwarzenegger) has become pleasant and even funny and not the gruesome drama of the model
The final scene is a typical Bollywood scene with hundreds of actors and actresses dancing in Mumbai's Victoria Station and it is some kind of cherry to top off the ice cream
This film will entertain you deeply if you try to use your brain to see the social discourse that is hiding behind the flashy and colorful surface.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

$REVIEW.: Producing a sequel to a unique horror film like "Phantasm" had to have been a challenge, but somehow writer/director Don Coscarelli managed to strike gold twice. Arriving nearly ten years after its predecessor and in a decidedly different climate, "Phantasm II" shifts gears from the creepy, dream-like original to a unique action/horror hybrid and passes with flying colors. While the tone is noticeably different from the first, most of the elements that made the original so special are re-arranged to make something altogether different and ultimately, well, fun.Picking up where we left off in the original, Reggie (Reggie Bannister) and Mike (re-cast from Michael Baldwin to James LeGros) effectively send the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) packing. Unfortunately, after spending a number of years in a mental hospital, Mike starts having visions of his foe as well as a mysterious young girl (Paula Irvine). Together with his surrogate big brother, he goes on a cross-country quest to track down the Tall Man and defeat him once and for all."Phantasm II" is a rare case of a sequel breaking away from the format of the original and succeeding in its own right. The film makes nods to horror movies of its time -- there's a bit of "Elm Street" and "Evil Dead" sprinkled throughout -- and it's remarkable how well it comes together. Coscarelli does an excellent job of keeping the pace going while balancing ambitious ideas and bizarre special effects. It's not quite as challenging as its predecessor, but that's part of the film's charm. Bannister is as game as always as the loveable Reggie, while LeGros steps into Baldwin's shoes effortlessly. The two have excellent chemistry together and the journey they take is every bit as fun and the frenzied finale the film offers.From front to back, "Phantasm II" is good old spooky fun from the late `80s as only Coscarelli could deliver. And if that's not enough for you, there are still two more enjoyable sequels to plow through. "Phantasm II" is but a landmark in one of the most bizarre and unique horror series of its time.

$REVIEW.: GREAT 1950's horror/adventure double feature

 Monster from the Ocean Floor is about a girl on vacation in a village in Baja California who gets hooked on the stories of a sea monster that has been causing strange disappearances for years

 The monster is silly when you see it

 A giant octopus with one huge eye that occasionally comes out of the sea at night to hunt land creatures
 Even so, despite the silliness those moments have an eeriness to them


 The locales, no matter where they were filmed, seem authentic


 The picture, for an extremely low-budget film, looks good and the black and white photography is crisp and clear
 Serpent Island is about a young woman after gold her ancestors once stole that's on a Caribbean island

 She hires two seedy characters to help her and only one has any positive character
 They end up on said island where the gold is hidden, but the local voodooists take exception to interlopers looting their treasures
 The quality of the picture is pretty OK and probably about as good as it is ever going to get
 Fun pair of low-budget bad-movie flicks
 Highly recommended for fans of these genres.

$review_text.: PARIS WHEN IT SIZZLES. . . I knew when I ordered, that this was an oldie, so I did not expect an outstanding story. I have always admired both Audrey Hepburn and Bill Holden. (What ever happened to his career.?)As expected the story was somewhat improbable, but still enjoyable if you didn't try to analyze the script.This is another one which I will dust off after another five years. Worth keeping in the collection simply to remember what movies were like in the 60's.

$REVIEW.: First, I want to state that I did not watch Nikita on television, so my comments are limited to my viewing the Season One box set.  Second, I find it sad, but not surprising, that recent reviews have panned the show or the dvd quality.  In an entertainment world over 10 years later, Nikita lacks the "luster," the "non-stop explosives," and the "mindless CGI effects" that viewers today take for granted.  Moreover, since Nikita has a more "cold war" feel to it, I am sure those who didn't live during the cold war or did not learn their history lessons, may find it hard to understand that "terrorism" existed in abundance prior to our country's current activities.  Third, like many, I wish the show was in wide screen formate, but if reviewers and buyers read the description (and do a little research), they will learn that the show was not filmed in that formate.  Fourth, and most important to me, I take exception to reviews that pan the show for "poor storylines, poor acting, poor production."Sadly, I purchased the Alias series--which I really like--first, so I found myself dismayed at the "copy cat" nature of Alias.  Nikita is truly a much superior show: the writing is tighter; the directing and editing excellent; the themes and story lines are fuller and more realistic; and, perhaps most importantly, the look is genuine--the producers utilized Toronto very convincingly; (I almost always felt like they were really on location, having lived in Europe for three years).  Peta Wilson was perfect for the show, her performances were generally outstanding, and over-all, award worthy.  While I personally did not care for Roy Dupuis' character, the actor's portrayals should not be confused with the character.  And Roy's portrayals are very commendable.  Together, Roy and Peta had great "chemistry"--as they say.  Thus, I can state, with all due respect, that in my opinion the show does in fact have great story lines, superb acting, and amazing production (which was on a "shoe string" budget, even for the time).All of that said, what really distinguishes Nikita is the fact that I find the episodes to be about relationships, not spies, sci-fi, terrorism, theoretical "ultra-secret" governmental agencies (albeit, I am sure the Bush administration would really enjoy the freedom of Section One), or any thing else.  It is a microscopic look at the way people interact (both in 1995 and today).  That is, through the established structure of the fictional Section One, relationships between people are highly controlled and well defined.  One wrong move and you are "dead;" figuratively or (from the view point of the show) literally.  One misunderstanding between two people can cascade into all sorts of outcomes.  Lies and truths are intertwined (granted, in exaggerated excesses), driving the various relationships.  Trust is a commodity that is elusive and even harder to maintain; games are habitually used.  And POWER is the key to all relationships, interactions/actions, and motivations--either directly or indirectly; with or with out awareness.Watch Nikita, and look for yourself in the mirror that it holds up for us to look at our own lives.  I truly doubt that the creators and staff of Nikita intended to create a reflection of how relationships work, and I am not one to claim I know how they work.  However, having a Ph.D. in both Sociology and Anthropology, it is my opinion that this is the strength of the series, Le Femme Nikita.  For those interested in readings that influence my professional position, I recommend the following books in particular: The Homeless Mind: Modernization and Consciousness by Peter Berger, et al; Valuing the Self by Dorthy Lee (not available from Amazon); From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology by Max Weber (or any of his other works); Mind, Self, and Society by George Herbert Mead; and The Power Elite by C. Wright Mills.As one final note, I would like to present MY personal opinion and position concerning the topic of Nikita: terrorism.  As a former military officer with considerable experience in security, intelligence, and anti-terrorism in mid 1970s, I believe that Nikita's portrayal of how terrorism must be dealt with is much more realistic than our so called "War on Terrorism."  Terrorists must be fought with terrorists: not hard working, patriotic soldiers of our fine military.  Terrorism is NOT war; and rhetoric cannot change that.

$review_text.: Not Your Typical Bigfoot Movie is not a great film nor documentary. It is not particularly deep on the plight of the downtrodden and disenfranchised (both examples being white, middle aged males, no less), and it certainly has little to do with Sasquatch research. But it has something. In fact, it has two things that many films that are leagues above it in all qualitative ways do not have: that is empathy and hilarity. Think of films that have one of those qualities. They almost always lack the other- be they documentaries or fictions. Most comedies nowadays tend to be hip, snide, superior, whilst most films that show compassion seem to be relentlessly dry, PC, and `serious' (emphasis on the quotation marks about serious). Think of any film in the last 20 years that is great in one of these categories and, again, it will almost always lack the other, in spades. But this film does not. Just when you want to cry and feel sick over how idiotic and gullible these men are, Wayne will start sucking on a rotten apple, comment on it, then suck it some more. Or Dallas will start pointing to a dark spot in a photo and insist that he sees a head or arm or something Bigfootian. So, the fact the film has loads of these two qualities makes it not great, but exceedingly likable. And, upon further review, also quite a good documentary. One may not be so moved to get to know the two idiots any better, but the chances are you will not regret having watched this film. I don't.

$REVIEW.: I might as well start by saying that the use of dead languages in the movie was amazing
That is the only reason I rate this movie 2 stars instead of 1.Now, where to begin? Why did Gibson make this movie? Well, Christianity is the largest religion that is currently in existence

If you create a movie that has 40% of Christianity buzzing, the other 60% will take notice


Would you believe that Sunday school children were actually taken to see this drivel? I can, know why? Gibson created one of those movies that make a whole group of people feel they have to see it


You ever see how many star wars fans lined up to see episode 2? That's because they felt they had to see it, no matter how bad it is.Another thing that people blow out of proportion is how Gibson used his own money to make this movie


So what! He makes a couple million each movie he makes! And don't you think he kinda knew that it would be a box office smash? I mean a movie about Jesus created by Mel Gibson?! Cha-ching! If Gibson had donated the money to the Christian Children's Fund, then that'd be something.Did you know that the Bible says very little about Jesus' death? It doesn't go in-depth like this trash does
What you basically are presented here is a snuff movie that shocks the moviegoer into paying attention.The basic idea behind this movie is that Jesus died for our sins; a theme that Gibson pounds into us as much as possible


He tries to display, as graphically as possible, the passion of Christ
This leaves many Christians open to saying things like "how can you still be a (non-Christian religion) when you just saw how much Christ suffered for you?" The ultimate guilt trip.A person shouldn't be forced to believe in something just because of how horrendously the "prophet" died


They should follow it because of what they taught

The fact that people went in droves to watch this filth is a real disservice to Jesus
Jesus taught love, forgiveness, and compassion
Why do you need a 3-hour movie to remind you of his teachings? Why do you need to be shocked into following his examples?Let me also remind the reader that the passion has existed since the Middle Ages

Do we really want to go back to a time of fire and brimstone and all that jazz? Why drag an old, tired play into the 21st century?And finally, I would like to close by saying this: I am not a Christian

I'm sure I made that abundantly clear
I was raised catholic but have since converted
I am a spiritual man and I am very open-minded

I believe in love and kindness and forgiveness


What hypocrites some of these reviewers are when they create reviews with titles like "A TRUE MASTERPIECE !! SHOWS HOW STUPID NON BELIEVERS ARE" That review was created by a person called "S.D.S" Look at his other reviews, he calls Dale Earnhardt some pretty horrible things

If you were a true believer then you would not judge him, since you are not God
And even if you were God, YOU'D FORGIVE HIM!As long as you live a good life, as long as you love your neighbor, as long as you forgive he that hurts you, you are living for the Lord

And you don't have to watch this movie to prove how much of a believer you are

So instead of wasting time to watch this horrible movie, why don't you volunteer at a homeless shelter, or donate the money you would have spent on this movie to a charitable organization?



$SUMMARY.: Donate your money, don't waste it on this!

$review_text.: I thought Planet Terror was awesome and the better of the two Grindhouse movies! We first meet Cherry Darling doing a sexy go-go dance, but she wants to quit. During this time, some Military men are meeting at a Military base with a scientist named Abby. The Military need a huge amount of deadly biochemical agent called DC2. When the deal goes wrong, Abby shoots the DC2 and it all fills the night air and infects some of the town's residents. Then we meet Dr. Block and his wife, Dakota. They work the graveyard shift at the hospital. Meanwhile, Cherry runs into her old boyfriend, El Wray. During a ride in his truck, they run into some trouble with zombies! Cherry loses her leg, and Wray takes her to the hospital. At the hospital, the bodies keep rolling in, and the zombies take over. Cherry, Wray, Dakota, and the sheriff all meet at the sheriff's brother's BBQ place called The Bone Shack. They try to figure out how to survive the zombie outbreak, and get taken to the military where the final battle between the living, and the dead! There were a lot of awesome gore scenes! If you love zombies, and action, you'll love GRINDHOUSE PRESENTS: PLANET TERROR!!!

$review_text.: This film, while it may be regarding every boy's life growing up in whatever period of decade, not necessarily the nineteen-fifties, it can really relate to anyone. Not only does it voyage into Sonny Burns' yearning for sexual fulfillment, but it also concerns the mothers of these individuals, who just don't know when to let go, and it also voyages into the power of friendship, into the bond of two young men-one of whom being Sonny-returning home from the Army to discover that their attitudes on life, love, and the town in which they grew up in have altered in this bittersweet coming-of-age drama. Their chemistry was natural, and together they visually generated an improbable coalition rather than some silly contrast. Both men are circumscribed and callow, their inducement is focused on their genitals, and yet they burn with idealism, with fevered fantasies of their own eventual triumph (. . .)The theme which caught my attention most was that of Sonny's sexual frustrations and afflictions with his parents, whose religious beliefs are a matter in which they still assume he opts to follow, or rather neglect to face the fact that he just may no longer want to, like many individuals emerging a certain age, who'll depart from the past and take their own path to whatever life and career that awaits them. But it's not that Sonny necessarily was growing out of the whole scene of going to church every Sunday morning and saying a prayer before going to sleep. It's more that, as detestation grew within him over the years, he has grown to hate God for never bothering to give a helping hand when needed one to pull him out of all this wretchedness, the misery of waking up each morning knowing that he is trapped inside the same slender, opprobrious body and enduring the same life that seemingly never really has any light shed upon it (. . .) I was utterly moved and empathized such tortured souls, for I am quite similar to this character, thereby this very genuine film opens a tremendous amount of interest for its viewing, for I, every time I watch it, feel as though I was watching myself-resemblance between us is that great. I'm not so much proud to admit of the fact, but it's nice to see a film that doesn't concern the usual farfetched subject matters regarding the most inane things, and one that rather concerns issues which can resemble amongst many others out there, such as myself, for instance. Jeremy Davies was terrific depicting this character, capable of delivering both humor and great poignancy to the screen like the natural that he is.After having to deal with well over fifty actors whose goal was to obtain the roll of Sonny Burns-which essentially exemplifies how many others relate to this character and would like to express their feelings of rage, if you will, on screen-Jeremy Davies impressed the filmmakers with his uncanny take on the character; his brooding, indistinctly-uttered performance ideally captures Sonny's underlying indignation, confusion, and insecurities (. . .)While this synopsis may seem like the premise of a nineteen-fifties feel-good movie, Going All the Way emphatically subverts in any evoked nostalgic feelings. Its twisting narrative veers from relatively straight-although ennui-laden-jesting boy talk to surreal trips into Sonny's disturbed inner world, culminating in a profound and painful moment of sexual humiliation. So while it may seem as a direct comedy, it really isn't, as such a character's deepest desires disintegrate and are clear that a mere "fantasy" is all they'll conspicuously be. Besides, since when has a film that features graphical scenes of those in the progress of slitting their wrists in an attempt to use such unusual actions as a method of rehabilitation, been humorous by any means? Since when, huh? My advice to you would be to ignore the ostentatious synopsis on the back of both the VHS and DVD package, which bluntly describe the film as a "romantic comedy."

The new Pound Puppies is a totally different animation of the puppies but still cute.  With talking animated dogs you really can't go wrong!  The episodes are fun and the dogs made all of us laugh.

$REVIEW.: Richard Linklater wrote and directed this tribute to his mid-1970s  high school days. "Dazed and Confused" follows the exploits of a group of students on the last day of school in 1976. Randall "Pink" Floyd (Jason London) is a handsome, amiable quarterback who gets along with everyone: jocks, stoners, nerds, but is reluctant to sign a no-drugs-or-alcohol pledge that the football team requires for the next season. New seniors haze the incoming freshman from the junior high school, led by a bully named O'Bannion (Ben Affleck), who is determined to wallop young Mitch (Wiley Wiggins) in particular. Pink takes Mitch under his wing, and they all spend the night cruising around, boozing, smoking pot, and bashing the occasional mail box.Not a whole lot goes on during this night of revelry and mayhem, but "Dazed and Confused" does as much to capture suburban teen culture in the 1970s as "American Graffiti" did for the 1960s. This was the tail end of the Baby Boom generation, caught between the idealism of the 1960s and the materialism of the 1980s, feeling that they missed out on anything meaningful. Tired of thinking of the present as "some minor, insignificant preamble to something else", they go about living life as it presents itself, to a 1970s soundtrack of more than 30 songs. The film was made in 1993 with an ensemble cast of up-and-coming stars of the 1990s decked out in 1970s attire: Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Parker Posey, Mila Jovovich, Matthew McConaughey. It's a fun and fond trip back in time to a more laid-back America.The DVD (Universal 2004 Flashback Edition): Bonus features include 9 deleted scenes, an assortment of period ads and public service spots, and production notes. "The Blunt Truth" (4 min) is an anti-marijuana film that claims pot causes insanity. It looks like it was made in the 1960s. "Retro Public Service Announcements" (2 min) include one about venereal disease and the famous "crying Indian" spot about pollution. "VANS" (30 sec) is an advertisement. "Production Notes" (text) talk briefly about Richard Linklater's intentions and inspirations for the film. The disc is a DVD-ROM for Windows only. Subtitles are available for the film in French, Spanish. Captioning available in English. Dubbing available in French.

$REVIEW.: There are two reasons I refuse to watch this movie.  First: it got far too much hype.  It's been my experience that recent movies of such immense popularity usually fall into the &quot;Incredibly Overrated&quot; category  (Forest Gump, Braveheart, etc.).  I attribute this phenomenon to the  ridiculously low standards of the average schmuck.  The second reason I  won't watch this film: Mr. Leonardo Di Caprio.  It wouldn't bother me that  chicks really dig this guy if he was really worth the fuss.  A young Paul  Newman or even Tom Cruise are a lot more handsome than this lightweight  pretty boy.  I can only hope that most of us will someday wake up and  realize what an atrocious actor this punk is.  I liked him a lot better  when he was on Growing Pains;  At least then I could take pleasure in the  fact that Di Caprio was constantly upstaged by another atrocious actor,  Kirk Cameron.

$REVIEW.: There are things about this movie that were great. But then there were things about this movie that were just not so good or at least could have been much betterThe GoodThe acting: Hemsworth did exceptionally well. He was really the best thing about this entire movie. Theron did a very good job as the queen as well and the majority of the other actors (especially the dwarves) had a very good performance as well.CG: The special effects were great. From the phantom armies to the environment, this movie did a great job of portraying a mystical land full of danger and beautyEnvironment: Costumes and landscape were great. From the merky dungeons, to the ugly castles, to the dreary towns, dark forest, sanctuary, animals, everything about the environment was just great. They probably could have done a little more with the black forest but still, what they did do was great.The ok but could have been much betterBattle Scenes: So the previews led me to believe this movie would be a braveheart style movie with a heroine and in the land of mysticism. It wasn't. There were a few battle scenes that were good but most were rather boring and no where close to epic. The very last confrontation was the best and did get you into it but every battle scene leading up to it was lack luster.Story: Now the story is the story that we have all heard before. So I'm not complaining about THAT story, but really they didn't do enough with it to warrant me shelling 20 bucks for me and my wife to go sit in a theater to watch it. If you are someone that just ABSOLUTELY loves the story of Snow White then maybe you probably won't care but all the glitter and glam they added to the story, still fell short of being worth it and taking it from the old old story I've grown up hearing.The badThe acting: Kristen Stewart. I'm sorry but this was either not her movie or not her performance. I liked her in adventureland. But her acting skills either weren't strong enough for this role or she just wasn't the right match. She just fell short unfortunately.All in all it's a decent movie worth watching. Is it worth shelling out 10 bucks a person to watch? No probably not. Is it worth a buck at redbox? Definitely. The beautiful environment and classic story are enough to bring you in but the lack of originality, boring battle scenes, and uneven acting is enough to give you pause.

Made long before special effects became merely technical matters, the mountain climbers in this film were the real thing, and the risk-taking boggles one's mind
Cujones for sure!

$REVIEW.: This review is for the 3D version of the film "I Robot". Just got mine,(on its release date),and all I've got to say is, this dvd has got some of THE best 3D I have ever seen. BAR NONE! I understand it wasn't shot in stereo, however, some of the 3D is actually better than some that were. Coulda fooled me. All other studios with your massive catalogues of dvds take notice! This is no joke. I'm thinking with most of the 3D films out there done in post anyway,(not shot with stereo cameras ),this is a no-brainer. "I Robot" looks as though it was planned shot by shot for 3D, filmed in 3D, and distributed in 3D. As my 24 yr.old son and I watched this dvd on my 65 inch LG 3D set,he said to me, "There's no way you could convince me this dvd wasn't originally in 3D if I didn't know it for sure already."So, all you other studios need to get on board with this. It's gotta be a money maker. I mean, it's not like you don't already have the property. Yes?Maltz

It left it open for more, but I think it's fine where it closed...In other news...thank goodness they didn't use the original artwork for this box set that they had planned to use!  At least the fans' voices were heard and they made it more like the traditionaly OC DVD sets...thank you Warner Bros

$review_text.: Finally, with "Fahrenheit 9/11," a bright and unavoidable light has been shined on things done in darkness. Any true American should shed tears when this important film tells how many legal Florida voters in democratic counties were disenfranchised on election day 2000, and how the subsequent wailings of leaders concerned about the damage done to our great democracy by what went down in Florida, fell on deaf ears in D.C. Something stunk that night in the sunshine state, and stinks to this very day, but, I guess it was clear early on that the we were entering a time when dissenting or questioning voices would be drowned out or silenced.Fortunately, Michael Moore's voice could not be silenced and the Bush family power structure had no way to manipulate the results. That's right, Moore's pack-of-lies movie did make it into theatres and played to packed houses for weeks and weeks, and became water-cooler, lunchroom, chatroom, cellphone, email and dinner conversation all over our great land. Now the pack-of-lies is coming to DVD, and to the DVD audience, I say, welcome to the light.

Even though this doesn't even come close to the original, it's not a total loss. The special effects and even some of the CG are impressive. And just the look of the massive ship both before and after the tragedy are awesome to watch. But the acting is rather bland, and that totally surprised me considering the cast. Also, Wolfgang Petersen made The Perfect Storm, which was a great movie, so I know he knows how to do wave effects, but the 'Rogue Wave' that turns the Poseidon looks lame and cheap, not very exciting at all. Not too mislead anyone, since I graded this a C, it actually deserves 2.5 stars, mmmkay?

$REVIEW.: Matthew Bourne's version of the Nutcracker has a storyline that begins in a Victorian orphanage, where Dr. Dross (Drosselmeyer in the traditional version) and his wife are portrayed as pompous meanies who intimidate the kids.  Further contrasting with the original, the Dross children are ungrateful, spoiled brats, and act true to form during their visit to the orphanage.  The Governors arrive to inspect the ward, but there's more bickering than revelry, and the presents they've brought for the children get taken away as soon as the "festivity" (read commotion) is over.  Come bedtime, Clara dreams that the Nutcracker doll (who's a dead ringer for a puppet from the Howdy Doody Show; hilarious!) comes to life, breaks apart the walls of the orphanage, and whisks her away to a snowy paradise.  The second act takes us to "Sweetieland," where everything (and everyone, apparently) is made of candy.  When Clara falls in love with the Nutcracker Prince, a love triangle(!) results when the Sugar Plum Fairy also makes overtures to the prince.  After the requisite series of theme dances we're back at the orphanage, where Clara wakes up to discover that her "prince" is actually one of the boys in the ward.The unique mix of characters and storyline held my attention throughout, with help from the original Tchaikovsky score that enabled me keep my bearings from beginning to end (i.e., "so this music occurs when this character . . .").  The more one is familiar with the traditional Nutcracker story, the easier it will be to make the leap into Mr. Bourne's fantasy, as comparisons between this and the original interpretations will be more interesting and enlightening.  [I would definitely NOT recommend this for anyone's first viewing of the Nutcracker]The dancers/actors display over-emoted gestures and facial expressions, but this is necessary to convey a much more comical and spirited production (the performance was filmed before a live audience).  As expected, the choreography also strays from the traditional, incorporating a mix of modern dance, swing, and even folkloric elements.  I like this a lot.  You will see a hint of more traditional ballet steps, although, without pointe shoes the "ballerinas" are more free to execute the diversity of movement.  The choreography is amazingly tight, and even the curtain call has the cast taking positions on cue.  The costumes are anything but traditional, ranging from the dull, threadbare orphanage clothing to the wild, feathery, colorful (pink dominates) outfits in Sweetieland.Some clever elements incorporated into Mr. Bourne's storyline are the allusions to movies ("One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" for one) and some bits of playful sexual innuendo-Sweetieland characters licking each other as well as the candy (children will likely remain unaffected).  Also, the ending dance suite involves many highly self-absorbed personas who, when not watching themselves in mirrors, seem to be playing out a game of one-upmanship from dance to dance.  Very fun to watch.The sound quality is fantastic:  clear, bright, and well balanced.The camera work made excellent use of both traditional and oblique-angle perspectives, but had many instances of image framing where the performers were cut off at the waist (my pet peeve), thus depriving the viewer of some excellent footwork and body language.  The run time of 80+ minutes zipped by pretty quickly, and I would have enjoyed seeing some scenes played out a little longer.  Still, it's a good show, and I'd recommend this performance to anyone but first-time Nutcracker viewers or ballet traditionalists.

$review_text.: The 1930s Agatha Christie novel AND THEN THERE WERE NONE was a sensation: ten unconnected people are invited to an isolated resort only to discover  they have been lured by a hidden psychopath intent on bumping them off one by one in retribution for crimes they have committed in their pasts
 Nothing like it had been seen before, and Christie adapted the novel to the stage where it proved equally popular


 A 1945 film version of the stage adaptation by director Rene Clair was also extremely successful with both critics and the public
 But in the 1960s Christie sold the film rights to a number of her novels, and the result was string of low budget films starring Margaret Rutherford as Jane Marple

 Christie openly despised these films, but Rutherford's enjoyable comic performances made them very popular at the box office, and a remake of AND THEN THERE WERE NONE became inevitable.Director George Pollock, who worked on Rutherford's Jane Marple films, was also responsible for AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, which was released under the work's American title TEN LITTLE INDIANS
But on this occasion Pollock bit off a great deal more than he could chew, for the plot of TEN LITTLE INDIANS cannot be reduced to a single comic turn; to be effective it requires an ensemble cast, and in spite of one or two worthy peformances Pollock's tampering with the story's details and dumbing-down of the plot renders the whole film extremely flat
 The only enjoyable performance in the film is by Wilfrid Hyde-White; the rest of the cast is either impossibly over the top (Daliah Lavi), tiresomely wooden (Shirley Eaton), or embarassingly bad (Fabian.)The direction, script, cinematography, and art direction range from the merely serviceable to the absolutely unimaginative, and the absolute best that can be said for the whole thing is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity.Even so, Christie's basic premise gives the film enough interest to keep you watching--and along the way something happens: the movie becomes entertaining in a cult-film sort of way


 Much of this is due to the film's extremely inept effort to cultivate a &quot;swinging sixties&quot; tone, which combines very oddly with its utter lack of inspiration and the very weird range of performances
 It all adds up to something faintly ridiculous, faintly &quot;hooty,&quot; and that alone makes the film the whole thing oddly enjoyable


 Even so, I wouldn't go out of my way for this particular film: you're better off catching this on the late-late show than actually buying it


 (And you should absolutely, positively avoid still later remakes, which are truly sorry.) Save your money for the 1945 Rene Clair version--which is, by the way, now available on DVD as well as videotape.

$review_text.: This is probably one of the better films for suspense I've seen since Wages Of Fear.If you think that a film that takes place inside a seven by three foot box would be dull - you are wrong.I don't understand how anyone could give this film one, two or even three star reviews accept that some folks could not take the propaganda, the subject matter or the very dark black aspects of the film.  And if that is the case - I can understand why.The plot - a contractor is held hostage in Iraq - buried underground in a coffin sized box with a lighter a crappy flashlight and a cell phone with a dying battery.This is grueling, suspenseful, and technically brilliant film making and a least the flms star should have gotten an academy award nomination if not the director.I wondered if the film makers were sometimes aiming for black comedy ala Hitchcock - think along the lines of Frenzy, Psycho and Life Boat.  If so - they should have also listened to Hitchcock describe the cause for his box office flop Saboteur.Buried also reminded me of some of the better aspects of two other clustrophobic trapped people films Shuttle and Open Waters - Spoiler here - both with extremely dark down endings.Buried is a must see for any film maker or aspiring film maker or anyone who craves clever film making and good suspense.  If Hitchcock had made a movie from this script - It could not have been any more suspenseful but if Hitchcock had made it - he would have cut out the propoganda tweaked the ending and maybe his film might not have flopped.Now for the propaganda - and this is not meant to take anything away from the film-making aspects which were all top notch. There is allot of anti-west propaganda in the script for Buried.  For example - There is sympathy for an extremly cruel murdering kidnaper described as "He's just like you, his family is starving - what would you do on his situation?" hmmm. And then painting every western company, government agency or person with an American or English accent as either cold blooded or inept or both.The American victim is a very unsympathetic character. He seems to be the cause of his own problems both outside and in the box. (I almost wondered if the film makers relished giving him what he gets - I for one was not on their side) Buried paints the victim as a not to smart American mercenary who drinks, takes anxiety medicine, is an abusive x-husband and is cheating on his present wife and mother of his kids.Had Buried not been so clever, well made and well acted I would have given far less stars for interjecting crappy political propaganda.  Hey - I don't mind when a writer or director are up front about their politics - but please don't sneak it in your film.  It's darn boring and you are toying with making a box office flop - and in this case it is what happened.Otherwise - with some reservations - it's still great film making.
$SUMMARY.: Great film if you love suspense - but beware the propanda

A-PLUMBING WE WILL GO has the Stooges wrecking a society party (this is the one where the startled cook cries, &quot;This house has sure gone  crazy!&quot;). VIOLENT IS THE WORD FOR CURLY is not as violent as the  title; it's a collegiate comedy in which the Stooges sing a charming  musical number called &quot;Swingin' the Alphabet.&quot; And PUNCH DRUNKS  is the famous, early comedy in which pugilist Curly goes crazy every time  he hears &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel.&quot; An excellent sampling of Three  Stooges slapstick, and film buffs will notice the different directors'  approaches to the material. Great examples of short-subject comedy.

$review_text.: The HOUR OF THE GUN is a remarkable achievement for its time, following the exploits of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and company AFTER the gunfight at the OK Corral ... and it's fascinating.Jason Robards plays a wonderfully subdued Doc Holliday, almost to the point of trying to remain Wyatt's moral voice.In a surprising turn, James Garner turns in a dynamic performance as the stiff-laced Wyatt, who won't rest until justice for the death of his brother has been avenged.This film serves as a companion piece to THE GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL (wildly inaccurate in most of its depictions), and it succeeds admirably in attempting to set the record straight.But, there's still the Johnny Ringo bit ...While a VHS purchase may work well for some Wyatt and Doc purists, I'm holding out for a DVD widescreen version, hopefully with some extras for those of us who believe good things come to those who wait.

$REVIEW.: Apparently, this film didn't do that great at the box office, but I absolutely LOVED this movie.  Janeane Garofalo is such an under-rated actress! She's so damn funny and cute, I don't know how anyone could not like this film.  It takes place in Ballinagra, Ireland (actually the town of Roundstone, Ireland) during a Match-making festival.  It's a charming small town with locals that are full of piss and wind - as are most Irish towns.  If you ever have the chance to visit Roundstone, I highly recommend it (I spent my 30th birthday there just because of this movie!).  Anyway, the chemistry between Marcy & Sean is tremendous! If you're looking for a funny Irish movie, look no further.  Great one liners and Irish charm throughout the entire flick.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time.

$review_text.: I am a fan, I would have been happy with 2 hours worth of Mulder and Scully doing absolutely nothing in the screen, as long as they were back. But, we have been given a lot more! Chris Carter has given us a thriller and a pretty good one at that.The film follows FBI agents in their search for a missing agent. They are aided by a man, a priest of questionable morals, who has visions. They bring in Mulder and Scully, now a surgeon (since when?!) to help them in their investigation. If Mulder helps, all will be forgiven (a bit of a stretch since he was charged by the military for murder after all). Regardless, our favorite couple discovers a sinister plan that will make you cringe.Amanda Peet is the FBI Agent that brings Mulder in. Her character could have been better used. Skinner makes an appearance!The movie was sinister, evil, spooky and just plain wrong. It was great! To top is all off: Mulder and Scully. There is nothing bad we can say about their acting and their portrayals...they own these characters, they created them, and made them the memorable characters we like. The direction was excellent, with amazing long shots and beautiful photography. The great musical score was done by Mark Snow, who else would have been better for this?!For the X-philes (fans): oh, this will be fun, sunflower seeds, "I want to believe" poster, pencils in the ceiling and a whole lotta Mulder and Scully talk. Priceless. Did you see Chris Carter in the scene at the hospital, sitting down?For the X-shippers, you will be happy. Mulder and Scully, what has happened will be answered and then some.For the non-fan: it was very easy to understand, there is not that much mythology, just some references here and there that are not necessary for the understanding of the plot.The movie is very good, and spooky, it talks about morality, about persistence and about beliefs. The movie once again, as the entire series of the X-Files did, challenges both Mulder and Scully in their beliefs along the way of solving yet another sinister crime. There are tons of plot holes and far fetched things though. Yes, there have been better episodes. But still, a great addition to The X-Files.Now for the big question: to buy or not to buy? Is there another special edition coming????

$REVIEW.: After watching TWINE for the 1st time, I was under the impression that it was one of the best in the Bond series

Then I bought OHMSS, and I got a true taste of what Bond adventuring is really about


I must admit I love  George Lazenby as James Bond, and wish he could have gone on to make a few  more films in the series

Not only does he carry the charm and charisma of  Bond, his fight scenes were also realistically done and are exciting to  watch- the desperation in his punches makes you feel that a real fight is  going on and not a fancy cheorographed sequence

Lazenby also does a good  job with the emotional aspect of the movies, something that the other Bond  actors couldn't have pulled off so well, mostly because they established  their images as womanzing, laid-back, and serious (Connery, Moore, Dalton)


 Besides all this, the movie also includes the very exciting ski chase,  which will spawn many different rehashes in future Bond movies

John  Barry's OHMSS title song is exciting, and Louis Armstrong's love song  &quot;We Have All the Time in the World&quot; is a charming secondary theme  for the movie


OHMSS is slightly long at 2 hrs and 22 min, but the fast  pace of the film will make you forget about that
My only complaint is that  the film quality of the pre-titles sequence looks dated and unremastered  compared to the rest of the film

Hopefully the DVD version corrects this
 All in all, highly recommended for those who want classic Bond action and  not formulaic stories.

$review_text.: I own 'The Big Green' on VHS and it's a great movie. It's about this really small town with nothing to do (they don't even have a pizza hut!) called Emma, Texas where the 'big kids' are used to taking the 'laid-back' approach on school. All of them at the begining have bad attitudes toward their new teacher Ms. Mountgumry (i know thats spelled wrong) a young teacher from England that tries to inspire and modivate the kids but at the begining doesn't have very much luck.While trying to teach Geography Ms. M decides to try to get the kids attention by breaking the globe on her desk and begin to do a soccer 'trick' the kids are very impressed and this begins the story line for the rest of the movie. She decides to form a soccer team with Sheiff Tom helping her couch (but at first the only reason he's there is because he's smitten with Ms. M) although the kids hate the idea.Ridicously they have their first game against an all-wining but snotty team 'the knights' with an a hole for a couch (couch Jay) who takes an interest in Ms. M. and grew up with Sheiff Tom and constantly puts him down.Of course, they get slaughtered and humiliated. After this the kids are ready to forget the whole thing.But Sheiff Tom and Ms. M pushes them to keep trying, they get their team name 'The Big Green' and keep trying even though they still suck.Their luck changes when the new kid in town and in class Duan moves with his mother and although he's very quiet and they tease him in class at first they come to find out he's an extrodinary talent in Soccer. After begging his mother to let him on the team, he's on the team and they start getting better more encouraged and start winning games.Everythings good until a family situation threatens to drive Duan out of town with his mom right before the final game against the team that slaughtered them before, The Knights.(Ms. M and Knights Couch Jay makes a bet that if the knights win Ms. M will kiss him, but if The Big Green wins he has to kiss their mascot ernie *a painted green goat*)it's a funny and sometimes touching ride that I recommend watch when your relaxing at home and need something to watch. It's for all ages something you can watch with your family or even by yourself.

$REVIEW.: I've seen so many clips from FRANKENSTEIN on television and in various film classes in college that I could never be 100% sure whether I'd actually ever seen the whole thing.  So I decided to make it one of my Halloween films this past October.  I'm pretty sure that I had never, in fact, seen the complete film, since I caught myself saying things like, "Oh, so that wasn't just a Mel Brooks gag! The assistant really DID steal 'Abby Normal's' brain!"  It seemed a little odd to be playing cinematic catch-up after all these years, but it speaks to the ubiquitousness of the 1931 classic in our popular culture that I even had to ask myself whether I'd ever seen FRANKENSTEIN in its entirety.Growing up in the 60s, you almost certainly had to have seen at least aware of the cultural impact of FRANKENSTEIN. The monster movies of the 30s and 40s were already embedded in the culture.  You watched THE MUNSTERS or read horror spoofs in MAD magazine, you absorbed the references even indirectly.  And somewhere along the line you were going to catch a clip of Colin Clive yelling with demented glee, "It's alive! It's ALIVE."  Or the scene where the monster, run fresh out of flowers to toss in the lake, throws in and inadvertantly (significantly) drowns the young girl who gave them to him in the first place.  On some level, seeing the film this late in life (in my 60s) seems almost redundant.Then again, it isn't.  At no point in my viewing of the film was I truly scared, but at some point in life you develop enough of a critical sense that you can fully comprehend why audiences in 1932 might well have been.  They hadn't seen the spoofs: nor had they had their critical sensibilities bludgeoned by computer generated special effects.  The creepiness stemmed mainly from director James Whale's moody, Expressionistic sets and--of course--from Boris Karloff's wordless performance.  Yes, Karloff will, at moments, call to mind Phil Hartman's imitation on SNL for many a contemporary viewer, but whaddya gonna do? Boris Karloff may not be quite as intimidating these days, and like anything else in pop culture, he's eminently spoofable.  But he had undeniable screen presence here.  Countless comic take-offs, cinematic or TV remakes and nearly 70 years of further cinematic technical developments can't alter that basic fact.  He IS Frankenstein's monster.How well did the film actually address what the narrator in the film's opening moments refers to as "the two great mysteries of creation: life and death?"  Well, that could be the source of endless debate.  By all accounts, Mary Shelley's novel really was about ideas.  The movie is really something of a muddle in that department.  Yes, the "scientist playing God" conceit is explored to some degree--as it would have to be--but as good as Colin Clive is in the role of Dr. Henry Frankenstein (cf. the novel's VICTOR Frankenstein), his character's vacillation from fairly mad (when you get down to it) scientist to callow young bridegroom is not really convincing.  His return to home, hearth and the love of a good woman is almost too abrupt and contrived.  That kind of obsession doesn't yield THAT easily to the entreaties of even the most loyal and saintly of women.  Except in the movies.Then there's the matter of that criminal brain.  The most intriguing aspect of the monster, as conceived by James Whale and embodied by Karloff, is his NON-criminal mentality.  He is, simply put, a child in an adult monster's body.  Why give him the brain of an evil man, implying as it does that the havoc he will wreak is the result of same, when a monster THIS grotesque would likely have created just as much chaos with the brain of an altruist?  Was Whale just a "bleeding heart liberal" who felt that die-hard criminals were just "misunderstood"?  Pretty prescient, considering it anticipated a debate that's been raging in this country since the mid-60s.Muddle notwithstanding though, this is great stuff.  Who cares whether it delves into life-and-death matters deeply enough?  There are plenty of very legit reasons why FRANKENSTEIN isconsidered a classic: the look of the film being but one of them.  I'm glad I  can finally lay claim to having seen it in its entirety.

$review_text.: Loved this movie, and would reccommend it for family veiwing.  It has everything that makes it charming for children, with just enough "spice" and literary depth so that adults can enjoy it, too.It is kind of quirky and sometimes a little scary feeling, but not intensely so.  I have 7 and 5 year old granddaughters who enjoyed it without having trouble sleeping afterwards.  It has humor, spookiness, sadness, romance, symbolism, and fantasy all rolled into one.  The ending will positively give you goosebumps!Since there has been so many reviews that compare this movie to Mary Poppins, I cannot resist the temptation to add my 2 cents worth.  Even as a child, I didn't care for Mary Poppins.  I know that a lot of people love it and it is a classic, but in my opinion is is just TOO syrupy sweet.  Nanny McPhee just doesn't come off as one dimensionally sugary, and is genuinely interesting to me.  There are some similarities in the message, but in Mary Poppins, the children are simply perfect and misunderstood while the parents are neglectful and need to be taught a lesson.  In Nanny McPhee, everyone has lessons to learn, and the children are depicted with as much to be corrected as the parent.  The result is a story that is so much more interesting and has a more truthful ring than Mary Poppins.I especially liked how Nanny McPhee's physical appearance functions much like a mirror to the people she is helping.  When she arrives, she is hideous - because THEY are hideous, but as the hearts of the family expand and grow, her appearance alters to reflect that.  By the end of the movie, Nanny McPhee is as beautiful as the family has become.  Love It!  It reminded me of the Bible verse that says, "All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness."  (Hebrews 12:11)  Very insightful message in my opinion.  I also thought it was interesting that not EVERYONE in this story is helped to be a "better person" - some of the characters are genuinely blind, greedy and evil.  The characters remain so until the bitter end and nothing can help them.  Nanny McPhee is sent only to people who have hearts that are able to change.  There has been some discussion among religious people over whether "Nanny" is a devil, but I think she is an angel.  Even God Himself can look ominous to people who are in a degraded state, and I have no problem with how she appears at first.  It is simply an indication of the state of the people who view her, and actually quite aptly drawn.I always thought that Emma Thompson is one of the most talented performers I know, but now I regard her as a bona fide genius, who can write as well as act.  I am not a star struck woman, but this is one person I wouldn't mind meeting some day.

$REVIEW.: The cinematography in this film is confused - - it switches between movie and documentary style, at will.  It didn't make me feel like I was watching a documentary or a movie - but it also wasn't a well done combination, in between.  I was more frustrated and distracted by the film making, than the ethics, topics, and situations of this film.The film had great ethical dilemmas, was a great political commentary, and profile of humanity, but I wasn't able to connect with any of the characters.  The human characters weren't very believable, especially the main character.  The doddering main character was in a position of power, but had no control over his trigger happy cohorts.  Perhaps this was commentary on our actual state of world affairs, when this was filmed, but it just lacked the punch or present context to make the character work.The main character is a flaccid nerd with no ethic or depth.  His fate in the movie was to develop that, but his redeeming moments were powerless, and his character does not invoke any inspiration or self reflection, in the audience.  Those who are going to see the nuance in this character's purpose are the people who are already aware of the state of humanity, politics, etc.  The point that is made with this character is so subtle and powerless, it won't affect the people in society that need to be affected in this way.You'll probably find yourself siding with the aliens, in the end, and realizing the entire film is an analogy for cases of cultural clashes and immigration, across the world.Otherwise, one extra star (bringing it up to three) for being a pretty cool sci-fi flick, with some great, and realistic animation.

$review_text.: This is a very moving film about the clash of two radically different cultures.  The young Jesuit priest, Father LaForgue, although very rigid in  his belief system, sincerely wants to help the Native Americans by bringing  them the Truth.  But his message of paradise has no meaning for the  Alogonquins, Hurons, and other tribes that he comes into contact with. They  cannot understand why he has no woman.  They fear him as a demon because he  reads from books and makes strange signs (of the cross).  He, in turn,  believes they are living in darkness and must be saved. He is fearful of  the vast forests where the devil reigns. There is a great deal of  complexity in the character of Chomina, the Algonquin leader who fears the  Black Robe but who feels honor bound to assist him. Father LaForgue is a  tragic figure, so lonely and confused in the vast expanses of 'New France'.  Why is he here, so far from his mother's comfortable drawing rooms? What  does he hope to accomplish? The film is beautifully shot on location. A  warning to the faint-hearted: there are some gruesome scenes in the film.  Black Robe is a moving, balanced film with a profound spirituality.

 I LOVED this movie and so does my husband, mother, and 4 and 2 year olds


 I never get tired of having it on when they want to watch it


 This movie will make you feel better about who you are than anything I have ever seen

 A must-see.There are about three or four very mild curse words that offended a few of our more strict friends, but it is less than what you hear on one TV show
 The message the movie gives, time and again, far outweighs anything else
 Every child cant be a princess or marry a prince or have a fairy godmother, but they can be loved for who they are.

$REVIEW.: Quentin Tarantino has been working on this World War II script for many years, and what is ostensibly a revenge film with moments of terrific dialogue and parallel subplots is a bit undone with untidy displays of violence and a fantasy denouement
 Nevertheless, the play is the thing and few writer/directors could fashion such an entertaining if mean spirited film like Inglourious Basterds with bravura performances particularly by Christoph Waltz as a most charming and lethal Nazi.Once upon a time during World War II a French man is questioned about the whereabouts of local French Jews by a polite German SS officer, Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) whose silky, sinister approach gets remarkable, deadly results from which one teenage French girl barely escapes.Next we meet Lt


Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt giving a Chad Everett by way of Clark Gable impression) who has recruited Jewish soldiers to hunt down and terrorize the Nazis in an Apache Indian way
 Any survivors do not escape unscathed but have a Swastika cross carved into their foreheads, their mark for life.In 1944, a young French woman, Emmanuelle, owns a movie theater and is wooed by a German war hero, Fredrick, whose  film, Nation's Pride, is premiering in Paris
 Fredrick gets Joseph Goebbels, head of German Propaganda to move the premiere to Emmanuelle's smaller theater
 She is in fact the young French girl (Shosanna) who escaped a massacre and is plotting to take revenge by killing all the Nazi attendees.At the same time, British Lt


Archie Hicox is sent to meet a double agent in France and, with Raine's men, attend the Nation's Pride premiere to blowup the theater and kill high level Nazis including Hitler

 Hicox meets the agent who is a famous German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger is glamorous) in a basement cafe
 German soldiers and an SS officer complicate things, and a Mexican standoff ensues with explosive results

 Having to alter plans, Raine substitutes himself and the surviving Basterds into the mission.At the premiere, as head of security, Col

Landa discovers the Allied plot, and Raine is arrested and interrogated in another building


 There, Landa makes a startling proposal even as Emmanuelle plots to ignite the film nitrate stored in her theater and the other `basterds' in the audience execute their part of the plan

 Seemingly spared the finale at the theater and having manipulated his own fate, Col
Landa and Lt
Raine have a day of reckoning.The usual Tarantino touches are here including excruciating scenes with gunshots, scalpings, stabbings, and bat beatings


 The film is structured in five chapters, and his love for movies is evident in references to German cinema icons, and, no doubt, major filmic influences from The Dirty Dozen (especially in the recruitment scene and the high octane finale), Where Eagles Dare, and any number of spaghetti westerns
 Imaginative use is made of fluid camera movement and rapid edits.While the cast is in fine form with Til Schweiger as a Charles Bronson-type, director Eli Roth as the Bear Jew, and M&eacute;lanie Laurent,  radiant as the haunted Emmanuelle, the standout is Waltz
 Pitt is a hoot as Raine (whose name is a play on actor Aldo Ray), and when he tries to spout Italian phrases, it is outrageous


 Veteran Rod Taylor and comedian Mike Myers have fleeting cameos.Some criticism of the film is warranted
 Infamous figures get killed at the premiere; if you are going to rewrite history even in a fable, don't take something that is so ingrained as to make an utter mockery of it

 Also, any sympathetic characters pretty much go out the window, so don't get too attached to anyone.No Tarantino film would be complete without wonderfully written set pieces especially the one in the basement caf&eacute; that is very reminiscent of the final standoff in Reservoir Dogs


 While his words are sublime and he is adept at setting up such scenes, he does not take full advantage of the possibilities of others which are given relatively short shrift like the arrest of Raine and the confrontation of Bridget by Col
Landa.For fans of the talented director, this one is a must, but for the average moviegoer, the snappy screenplay may not be fully appreciated in the overall context of an entertaining story that drips a bit too much blood
Two things are for sure: A glass of milk will never seem the same again, and Brad Pitt looks fabulous in a white tuxedo.

$REVIEW.: I was in Colorado in 1975 and picked up a Colorado Springs newspaper and saw they were filming this movie near Canon City. Well being a Charles Bronson fan, I had to go check this out. The Ramada Inn had a welcome sign for the crew. I went in to the hotel and they gave me the location where they were filming. My wife and I drove out to Red Canyon which was probably twenty minutes away and there we came upon the set. We saw Bronson, Warden, and Will Sampson. Bronson had long white hair which surprised me when the movie came out. The weather was great that day in April and I watched the scene where the indians were all standing across the canyon yelling on the rocks while Bronson and Warden stayed low across from them.The next day, we went back and it snowed like crazy and I guess that is when they filmed the snow scenes. I was glad to see Clint Walker in a film since he hadn't been in one for awhile. We never bothered any of the cast. Warden, Sampson, and some Indians came over and spoke since we were the only ones there that weren't part of the crew. Bronson would just stare at us from a distance probably because we were staring at him. He is a small man but he has the prescence of a real tough guy. His children were playing around in the rocks while he acted.Okay, now the movie review. It was entertaining but the buffalo, which was filmed in the studio, was poorly done and unconvincing as real.Hopefully, I didn't ruin anything for you because the movie is worth watching.

$REVIEW.: Before I review this DVD, I'd like to give some personal background first.Since October 2007, I think WWE has been on a very strong roll.  Rivalries were built steadily, and delivered come PPV time.  We were getting a good dose of comedy, violence, and technical wrestling.  But then the WWE Draft happened...not only were the roster changes shocking (and not in a good way), but they put a strange spin on the NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS PPV.  To add insult to injury, Vince McMahon decided to get incapacitated for the 2nd consecutive Draft.  His "injury" was not only a sick anniversary joke, but it was a premonition: The consistent cycle of good WWE product was about to end.NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS 2008, while successful in some areas, is the PPV marker of when things have gone sour.1) WWE Tag Team ChampionshipsJohn Morrison & The Miz (champions) v. Finlay & Hornswoggle---If you're expecting a tag classic when one of the competitors is a dwarf, you're missing the point.  From the opening bell, the match maintained a good pace, with some midget spots, smart teamwork, and crowd-pleasing maneuvers.  Is it a great match?  Certainly not.  But I was entertained from start to finish."6.5 / 10"---------------------------------------2) United States ChampionshipChavo Guerrero v. Matt Hardy (champion)---This was a tough one to call.  I love both of these guys, and I admired this particular match because both men look like they were  always trying to win.  There were no unnecessary high-risk spots or flashy counters.  The two engaged in a smart contest with quick pinfall attempts and submission holds.  What held it back for me was a ton of little things.  The occasional weak clothesline, or those few punches that didn't connect, or that predictable counter...you know, just small stuff that added up after a while.  Worth a watch, but kinda sloppy considering the talent involved."6.5 / 10"---------------------------------------3) ECW ChampionshipMark Henry v. Big Show v. Kane (champion)---Boy, this turned out way worse that I thought it would.  While I don't usually like "big man" matches, I understand they appeal to some.  But frankly, judging by the Dallas crowd, it's gotta be a small demographic.  The whole affair was a slow, plodding affair that had very little excitement.  Kane's not even in most of the match!  Maybe he was legitimately hurt, but you wouldn't know it after he got involved in those pseudo-exciting last few minutes.  If you're still pining for the old ECW, you better move on quick."3.5 / 10"---------------------------------------4) World Tag Team ChampionshipsHardcore Holly & Cody Rhodes (champions) v. Ted Dibiase & ???---Even if I paid the $40 fee to watch this, I'd still think it was worth my time.  The whole scenario was so well-executed.  Dibiase's music, entrance, and delay tactics were perfect.  The "match" was quick, as wrestling double-crosses should be.  Yes, I'm disappointed that there was no actual match.  But Dibiase needed this moment to get on the map.  The new World Tag Team champs are better off because of this PPV moment."No Score"---------------------------------------***Right about here, JBL cut a promo from his luxury skybox in the arena.  Interestingly enough, I found this to be one of the PPV's highlights.  I'm not a fan of JBL's in-ring skills, but on the microphone, few are his equal.  He berated Todd Grisham and the fans for not being considered a champion.  Throw in a spectacular camera angle where JBL towered over the background arena, and I think WWE deserves a few bonus points.***---------------------------------------5) Intercontinental ChampionshipChris Jericho (champion) v. Kofi Kingston---After our cocky IC champ cuts a promo to further his Shawn Michaels feud, "The Jamaican Sensation" reveals himself to be the mystery opponent.  Sadly, I can't believe this match wasn't better than it turned out to be.  Jericho is one of the all-time greats in professional wrestling, and Kingston is so unorthodox in the ring - I was really looking forward to this one.  Like the U.S. Title bout, there are so many moments where things were just off.  Again, little things missed strikes or unimpressive high-risk moves.  There was even a "BORING" chant in the middle somewhere.  The last couple minutes were exciting with nice counters and close pinfalls.  Plus, the aftermath involving HBK was intriguing if a bit weird.  All in all, this one looked better on paper."6.5 / 10"---------------------------------------6) Women's ChampionshipMickie James (champion) v. Katie Lea Burchill---At this point, NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS has reached it's hour-and-a-half mark.  Thankfully, for the next 70 minutes, the event will be worth your time.  I've been really into the resurging women's division for months now, and if this one doesn't impress you, nothing will.  I don't know much about Katie Lea, but after this impressive showing, I'm gonna do some research.  Mickie James is one of the most reliable Divas, both in character and in-ring performance.  The match includes some nice counter-wrestling, and very good submission-storytelling.  Good wrestling, good length, good pace, good match."7.0 / 10"---------------------------------------7) World Heavyweight ChampionshipEdge (champion) v. Batista---Yes, these two had an almost identical scenario at last year's NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS.  However, that also means Edge and Batista had one of the evening's best matches.  Edge is so gifted that I will never get tired of him being involved with the championship.  Batista has come a long way over the past year or so, and Edge complements him as well as anyone (even Undertaker).  The best part about this contest is that it never slowed down too much, meaning both men got a good amount of time to control the pace.  The match did feel a little short, and I'm not 100% satisfied with the screwy finish.  But rest of the match featured a nice slow build-up, and some new tricks that these hadn't shown me before.  Overall, a very good showing.  I'd love to these two go at it again."7.5 / 10"---------------------------------------8) WWE ChampionshipJohn Cena v. Triple H (champion)---As most have probably said, this main event was similar to the WRESTLEMANIA 22 showdown.  The contest was very slow-paced and methodical.  The focus was on the reversals and psychology, and not so much on the physical action.  If that's not your cup of tea, then pass the DVD up.  As for myself, I sat back and went for the ride.  There are a couple of reasons why this match works, where other similar angles fall flat.  Triple H, like him or not, is one of the most prolific WWE superstars; this 12th run as champion is arguably his most successful.  John Cena has been criticized for his "lack of talent."  I disagree there, because Cena is an amateur wrestling champion, which he demonstrated during his first few months on WWE TV.  Instead, Cena loses me when he overplays his underdog character.  But on this NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS showdown, the fight is more evenly-matched.  Both men made each other look good, and even though Cena still didn't use a lot of moves, he kept the match going.  What's most remarkable is that this rematch makes the WM 22 encounter better.  I don't think I understood the Chicago storytelling at the time (partly because it wasn't the "true" main event).  But now, like a good sequel, I can appreciate the original.  To my astonishment, my favorite match of the PPV."7.5 / 10"---------------------------------------OVERALL---NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS 2008 might be worth a peek for some fans.  It's full of surprises that still work, and has a good overall feel to it.  The Dallas crowd was reacting to the matches, the production crew used some good camera angles, and the last three matches delivered.  But fans who are into physical wrestling more than the "E" in WWE better look elsewhere.

$review_text.: This film has an all too rare combination of tight scriptwriting, great scenography, intelligent and powerful acting and an understated yet impeccable directing.The atmosphere of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire (re-created, if i read the credits correctly, in Prague) with its officious and fussy officials and confident courtiers convinced of their superiority, with great cities and remote hunting lodges, brings to us an era that even most Europeans have forgotten about
The film plays with contrasts - social contrasts between a lower class upstart, a middle class policeman and aristocrats; 'epistemological' contrasts between positivists, professional magicians and believers in spiritualism; contrasts between romantic passion and status..
 and above all, in what is a version of a Clint Eastwood riding into a dusty town,  the ultimately romantic twist of a stranger appearing in Vienna with nothing but a bag of tricks.The plot is tight, with many surprises and I enjoyed every minute of it
It is a smart and suspensful, but also funny and romantic, movie

It reminded me of 'Back to the Future' Scott/Santa is having a tough year because his wife is pregnant, his in-laws are visiting, and Jack Frost is causing trouble at the North Pole. When Frost becomes Santa in the past, Scott has to stop him in the future. (It's kinda difficult to explain.) If you like the other ones, you may like THE SANTA CLAUSE 3: THE ESCAPE CLAUSE!!!

Tennison, played by the very talented Helen Mirran, is a woman that could be a role model for many. Not only does she battle her way to the top of the British Metropolitan Police, she deals with some terrifying crime scenes and a few of her own secrets. Time and time again, she overcomes her own demons and the brutal sexism she faces on a daily basis.The series starts off with Tennison getting a big promotion and finds herself in the middle of a botched investigation. After she straightens things out, she gets most of her staff's approval, but that doesn't mean it's going to be an easy ride. The show takes you through baby abductions, bad cops, and some really gruesome murder scenes. Later in the series, you get to see some more personal aspects of Tennison's life. Her father loses his battle with cancer and this seems to be a catalyst for her drinking. All in all, a realistic look at British crime that leaves you on the edge of your seat through every episode.If you watch one season, you'll want to watch them all. This fantastic box set is a great value for your money and a wonderful way to get all seven years worth of episodes for one low price.***Complimentary copy received in exchange for an honest review***

$REVIEW.: Ok, Zach Braff is one of the most talented actors there is. He is one of the most versatile people there are.The Last Kiss is a story of a couple getting married because of a pregnancy. But, they are deeply in love, and cute together, the all-american couple. All of the decisions made, and their lives before them Braff's character gets nervous and starts a flirtation with a girl. After spending a night with her and kissing her he confesses and breaks the heart of his fiancee. After the fight he goes back and sleeps with her, the girlfriend played by Rachel Bilson.There are other moving parts, as all the characters are multi-dimensional. The movie includes stories within the stories of the things going on with his friends, their story, and love lost and found.Eventually Braff and Barrett fight it out, and by waiting and not giving up Braff is able to get Barrett to break down her barriers. Normally this would just piss me off- infedelity, yet her is forgiven- but it's what I like about the movie. It's different- and the forgiveness is the paramount of the love story. Is love stronger than what our morals and values tell us are right? Many people make the decision everyday to stay together. Interestingly enough- Braff get's amazing advice from Barrets father that helps him keep her. He's been the victim of his own wife's infedelity. It's amazing that the movie is very real. Some couples can get over infedelity- while others having never strayed just come to find they don't love each other, and a child is not enough to keep them together. You can't overcome the people you've grown to be sometimes. A lot of my friends were very disappointed- but I guess I like the movie because it's different. Never having been in the situation I hold firm that infidelity is where I cross the line, to me it is unforgivable. But, here you feel for Braff and want him and Barrett to be together forever, and see that his straying was only a lapse....Still, I am glad for the ending. It shows a new love story in a new light, and breaks all the typical cliche's.

$REVIEW.: Star Trek Next Generation had some good episodes in its run. (Season Four, for example, had a number of tight, well written, well-directed and acted episodes.) But many of the episodes in season two were pretty dismal. Some were okay, but the bad ones were so bad, they almost sunk the series.For example, consider "Shades of Grey," an episode in which Riker is bitten by a bug, then lies around for a few days in a coma remembering (dreaming) pointless vignettes from previous episodes. Deanna Troi and Doctor Polaski stand around his comatose body making weird cartoon-sad faces, and delivering truly horrific soap-opera-quality dialogue.I found this episode so appalling, stupid, poorly written, directed and acted, that I did a web search for online reviews to see how others felt about it. I found the following comments from the show's creators. Even the writers and producers were aware that it truly stunk. I had to edit them to take out the profanity, because there was so much of it in the quotes that Amazon deleted my first attempt at a review!'This episode is thought to be one of the weakest ever made. Maurice Hurley, who co-wrote the episode, commented, "Piece of s ***. It was supposed to be a bottle show. Terrible, just terrible, and a way to save some money. I was on the way out the door." (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages)''In 2012, Peter Lauritson recalled the episode, saying "It was just... we learned from that. I think, probably the worst we ever did. It was like "Never again." "Shades"... I don't even want to remember it." Likewise, David Livingston also commented "It's very cheesy and the fans didn't like it.''Ronald D. Moore called it "embarrassing". (AOL chat, 1997)'It's nice at least to read their comments admitting what a piece of garbage the episode was. God, it was awful. Uck.If you're looking for the "good" STNG episodes, start with season 3. And definitely get season 4. But skip this one. Some episodes, like "Shades," are horrific.
$SUMMARY.: Not their best season... some poor and borderline episodes.

$REVIEW.: The annual trek over the mountains to exchange salt for grain splits a community between its elderly chief and a rebellious young aspirant. Old customs vs. new thinking supposedly conflict; actually, neither is omniscient. The tale told also has hidden, unexplained inconsistencies. Nonetheless, the film is worth watching for the excellent photography that covers both the scenery and the lives of Tibetans living high in the Himalayans.

$REVIEW.: First, I am forever grateful to MPI for producing the entire series of Dark Shadows, initially in the VHS format, and now in the DVD format


It was a bold move to release an entire 5 year long soap! However, if this new complete series boxed set is going to give us the exact same quality as the previously issued DVD sets, I have to point out that starting with episode #442, which depicts the walling up of Rev

Trask by Barnabas, there are frequent and irritating loud sound glitches throughout many of the subsequent episodes

For those of you who have both the VHS and the DVD MPI products, compare them


Fast forward the VHS tape containing episode #442 to the scene when Trask is in the Old House drawing room and listen carefully to when he screams


Also, listen to when he screams towards the end of the episode when Barnabas forces him into the alcove


Then play the DVD version


You will hear a loud, hideous, echoing sound glitch which draws out both screams several seconds longer than the VHS! From then on, these sound glitches occur in later episodes, most often during the end-of-scene music "stinger"


Now, regarding the bloopers


MPI is promoting the new set as including a blooper cut out when the DVDs were first produced


The blooper occurred in the episode where Bathia Mapes attempts to exorcise Barnabas
MPI does not mention that there were other bloopers cut out

I can point out one, an episode where Burke, Vicki and Julia are talking about the murder of Dave Woodard

Julia leaves the drawing room and Burke and Vicki continue talking

Then an off-screen sneeze can clearly be heard..

on the VHS MPI tape only

This blooper was cut from the DVD release
There are several other bloopers cut also but fortunately, MPI got complaints from the fans and this practice of cutting the bloopers stopped


However, there are MANY of those above-mentioned sound glitches
My three star rating reflects not so much the product but MPI's failure to correct previous defects.

$REVIEW.: Kundalini Yoga for beginners and beyond with Ana and RaviFirstly a little about my journey so far. I discovered Kundalini Yoga just over a year ago now and prior to that I had a regular practice of Hatha yoga (a beautiful practice). When I commenced Kundalini Yoga I resonated with it completely, it was what I had been looking for, I felt like I had 'come home' and something 'clicked' into place. I practice daily in a morning and benefit greatly throughout the day. I have a good library of DVD classes by Ana and Ravi and they are all wonderful to work with. I have also developed a small library of books including some by Yogi Bhajan which I find very inspiring.Now to the reviewBliss.. Ecstasy.. Tranquility.. Grounded.. and yet Energised...........BeautifulThis DVD was everything that I hoped that it would be and more.The production is good quality, attractive scenery in the background with greenery, seascape, lotus flowers, bhudda statue and then the area in which Ana demonstrates. The sound quality is good and the music I found so beautiful and uplifting.Ana demonstrates the postures and meditations beautifully, she looks so calm, peaceful and radiant and that is how I feel when I am working throughout the class.There is a very good selection of chapters and you can also do presets or design your own class depending on your own situation for time etc with the matrix option which is easy to use and has a demo section on how to use it.The instruction is clear by Ravi and Ana and there is explaination throughout about the methods, how they work and the benefits they give. I felt like I went deep into meditation whilst working with this DVD, it was absolutely lovely and I feel blessed to have the opportunity to work with it.The class starts with Tune in via mantra. Then the choice is yours.There are so many options for whatever you wish to work on eg:Meditation for tranquility,Breath purification,Eliminate stress and self bless,Opening the third eye,Rewrite the book of your life,All and everything meditation,Meditation for total regeneration,Meditation into deep stillness,A beautiful healing mantra 'Ra Ma Da Sa Sa Say So Hung' this was total bliss!.The presets include one for beginners and also there is a section on the breath primer for those who are new to Kundalini Yoga so that you can learn the long deep breathing and Breath of Fire before you do the chosen meditation.There is a lovely guided relaxation lying on your back in Savasana.Then class ends with a final prayer and Tune out via mantra.I will be working with this DVD regularly and especially on a Sunday as that is my rest day and I focus on Pranayama and Meditation on this day so this DVD is just what I was looking for and it is just bursting with options.I am truly grateful to Ravi and Ana for producing this DVD, I feel just wonderful during and following the class...this is a treat.Sat Nam x

$review_text.: The Caine Mutiny was adapted from bestselling novel of the same name published in 1951, coincidentally the same year Nicholas Monsarrat published The Cruel Sea, which was also made into a film and released a year before the &#8216;Caine&#8217;.  Both, of course, dealt with similar subject matter; life on a small naval ship in combat during World War II and the trials and considerable tribulations of the officers and crew.  And both feature very strong central performances from the actors playing the ships&#8217; captains; Humphrey Bogart, in the case of the Caine, and Jack Hawkins, in the case of Compass Rose in the Cruel Sea.But to focus on the Caine, although it is through the eyes of young Ensign Willie Keith that we witness the gradual disintegration of the ship&#8217;s captain, it is the performance of Fred McMurray playing communications officer, Lieutenant Tom Keefer, which really catches the eye in this film and is central to all the action that subsequently unfolds aboard the ill-fated USS Caine.  It is Keefer who first gives voice to the suspicions that the officers and crew are beginning to have about the increasingly bizarre behaviour of their captain and it is Keefer, who, expert in the role of agent provocateur, and ever so subtly at first, incites executive officer Lieutenant Maryck (Van Johnson) to forcibly assume the role of ship&#8217;s captain over the objections of the officially appointed skipper, Lieutenant Commander Queeg (Bogart), when the latter seems certain to sink the ship in a typhoon when he &#8216;freezes&#8217; under severe stress.The only literally discordant note in the entire production is, unfortunately, the dreadfully inappropriate triumphalist score by Max Steiner!

$REVIEW.: I suppose if you still use training wheels, and you have never actually owned a "fast car", movies like Driven (all computer generated imagery) and Days of Thunder (OK, but really a star vehicle, not a racing movie) will thrill you.What separates the men from the boys in racing is the ability to finish a race, and win because you and the machine are one.This is the real thing. Filmed in the early 1960's, this was a major engineering accomplishment, which is also an aesthetic master-work. A lot of scenes look almost quaint by today's standards: the population of the world was only half what it is today, and places like Monaco were not overrun with degenerates like they are today.  So you don't have the human swill of "XXX", nor the street punks of "Fast and the Furtious". Instead, you ahve serious professionals: business people and drivers who engage in ruthless but still gentlemanly competition.The explosions and crashes in today's CGI movies are spectacular, but nowhere near as terrifying as the actual crashes shown in Grand Prix.  There is nothing like the real thing, baby, as an old song goes.GRAND PRIX is the real thing.

$review_text.: You could create an entirely new series out of all the logical inconsistencies in this one, but an entertaining and well-written show all the same. Ellen Muth plays George, a pitch-perfect disengaged girl who learns more about living after her death than she ever cared to while alive. Surrounding her are several other misfit refugees from the once-living, all lead by Rube, the immediate supervisor in their grim-reaping responsibilities, played by a relentlessly no-nonsense Mandy Patinkin. Parallel to their story lines, the series follows the splintering (and growth) of George's family along existing fault lines in the aftermath of her death.Sharp writing and excellent acting make this an enjoyable and worthwhile series if you enjoy the premise. Just don't squint too closely at some of the ongoing plot details about the co-existence of the dead and undead.

$REVIEW.: "Rio Rita" is a 1942 musical comedy starring Abbott and Costello with Kathryn Grayson and John Carroll as the romantic leads. The 1929 musical comedy, based on the 1927 play of the same name, also takes place in Mexico, but has little in common with this film, although Kathryn Grayson appears in both.This film is one of those rare comedies made about World War 2 (e.g., "To be or Not to Be", "The Great Dictator", "The Goose Steps Out", "Once Upon a Honeymoon"), although the use of "Nazi spies" is merely a convenience.Bud Abbott (1895-1974) and Lou Costello (1906-59) were comedy giants for two decades, wowing the public on screen from 1940 to 1956 and on TV from 1951 to 1953. They were the true successors to Laurel and Hardy. "Buck Privates" was their second film, and the one that propelled them onto the A list. They followed this with nearly 40 films, the best of which were such classics as "Hold that Ghost" (1941) and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). The "A & C Meet..." films alone spawned 7 films. By the mid 50s the comedic style of Martin and Lewis gained the upper hand and personal disputes between the partners brought the comedy to an end. As they had eclipsed Laurel and Hardy, Martin and Lewis stole their thunder, but even today one can't help but laugh at the gags.The current film is standard fare for the boys. The slapstick and patter that you're accustomed to is on display, and Lou is a little more animated since this is 1942 and he was still in good shape.The musical numbers are fine - both Grayson and Carroll were good singers and performers - and there is a Brazilian dance number that is better than average.1942 was a good year in films - "Yankee Doddle Dandy" and "Mrs. Miniver" were the clear Oscar winners and at the box office. Other popular films included "Casablanca", "Woman of the Year", Alan Ladd's "This Gun for Hire", Gary Cooper's "Pride of the Yankees", and "Road to Morocco"Fans of the boys will enjoy this film. But I'm not sure that it has broader appeal.

If it had been on a regular cable channel or HBO, I think the show would still be going.The show is very witty and very refreshing. It has a comical perspective that you generally don't see in shows on today. I love its unique aspect of being from the perspective of a grim reaper.

$REVIEW.: This movie is set in a period where emotions are banned due to them being unpredictable and often causing unfavorable results.  What follows by banning emotions and all things that would lead to emotion is a very oppressive scenario indeed.  People are ordered to take a drug to drown out their emotions, and all objects (including music and books) that could lead to emotion are destroyed.  As I said, very oppressive.  After missing a dose of his emotion-blocking drug, Christian Bale's character sees the light, both literally and figuratively.  What follows is a suspenseful action-packed plot, and ultimately a good ending.  Glad our government is not like that.

$review_text.: All the internet chattering aside, LAW ABIDING CITIZEN is just what it sets out to be - a thriller that keeps the viewer involved in the mind games of a passionate man right up to the end (uh, well almost - except for the needlessly sugary revolting Hallmarky last few frames meant to clean up the mess the movie suggests...)Kurt Wimmer wrote this 'taking justice into our own hands' story with a good deal of imagination and gadgetry and F. Gary Gary keeps the momentum of the story going along at a breakneck pace.  Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) opens his home door to face two thugs who beat and kill his wife and daughter and injure him substantially.  Shelton seeks a good lawyer and finds himself in the hands of smarty guy Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) who sets the film in motion by accepting a plea bargain on behalf of the killers - one will be sent to prison with the death penalty and the other just gets a little time. Shelton is distraught at this abuse of the justice game. Jump forward 10 years and the one killer has a botched heinous execution while the other, now free, is is laughtered hideously - both by Shelton.  There is a plan in Shelton's head to destroy everyone who allowed justice to misfire and the rest of the film is how the genius mind of Shelton (jailed after his slaughter of the killer) manages to wipe out everyone involved in the court system that instigated the terror.Butler and Foxx make a good sparring pair and there are some excellent cameos by Colm Meany, Viola Davis, Bruce McGill et al.  Yes, this is a violent film, and not for the squeamish, but it does make us look at the judicial system with different eyes.  If only the director hadn't glopped on the sloppy goodie-two-shoes happy-wappy scene that ends the film and feels like a purging cathartic....Grady Harp, February 10

$review_text.: Hilary Duff stars in this movie as a girl whose father dies in an earthquake. Because there is no will left her stepmother gets everything, including Sam (Hilary).The movie picks up 8 years later where Sam is a senior in high school preparing to go to college at Princeton (that is, if she gets accepted). High school isn't exactly a happy experience for Sam as she has only two friends. One real, one an email friend that texts her constantly. To everyone else in the school she's know as Diner Girl.Home isn't any better, as she is forced to live in the attic, do all of the chores, wait on her stepmother and sisters constantly, and work seven days a week at the diner owned by her stepmother.Since I saw the previews of this movie I thought it looked funny. I've been looking forward to it since the first preview. However, now that it's out and I read the reviews I was nervous. Luckily my fears weren't realized. This movie ended up being a sweet, family friendly, romantic comedy. Duff does an excellent job of portraying Sam. She truly is an excellent young actress, the pep rally scene is proof of this.While this movie wasn't really laugh out loud funny, it was funny at times, but more than that it was sweet and, for lack of a better word, cute. The direction was really nice. It wasn't super artsy, but it was well done and added a certain beauty to the film.Cinderella Story ended up being a really sweet movie that deserves a better reaction than it recieved. Great acting, a clever update of an old fairy tale, an awesome soundtrack, and a likeable cast makes for a great afternoon at the movies.

$REVIEW.: Dr. Meredith Grey: "Sometimes reality has a way of sneaking up and biting us in the ***. And when the dam bursts, all you can do is swim. The world of pretend is a cage, not a cocoon. We can only lie to ourselves for so long. We are tired, we are scared, denying it doesn't change the truth. Sooner or later we have to put aside our denial and face the world. Head on, guns blazing. De Nile. It's not just a river in Egypt, it's a freakin' ocean. So how do you keep from drowning in it?" Ellen Pompeo plays  Meredith Grey, a surgical intern, new to Seattle and Grace Hospital.The shows title is a reference to the famous anatomy book "Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body" by Henry Gray. Well known by all in the health care field, and very well memorized by all medical students. The music from each show is well worth listening to, most of it is new and on the top of the charts."Greys Anatomy" can be a play on words. Meredith is finding herself, not only in the surgical world, but in her personal life. Her mother is a surgeon suffering from Alzheimer's, her father is dead. She falls in love with the handsome Chief Neurosurgeon, Dr. Derek Shepard played by Patrick Dempsey. She later finds out he is married to a pediatric surgeon. Her new roommates are all surgical interns: T.R. Knight as bumbling, inept, George O'Malley; Sandra Oh, as  Cristina Yang , one of my favorites, and Katherine Heigl as Isobel "Izzie" Stevens. Cristina Yang has a one night affair with the hunky,Chief Surgical Resident, Preston Burke; that moves onto "true" lust. They are so diametrically different that the old saying" opposites attract" is, oh, so true.  And, then, there is "The Nazi",Chandra Wilson as Dr. Miranda Bailey. She whips the new interns into shape and keeps them on their toes. It turns out she has a heart as big as Kansas, but then, don't they all?The show is funny, has lots of drama, unrealistic at times and then more than real at other times. The workings of a real hospital? I will leave that for you to decide. The drama of every day in  the life of a surgical intern. Too much work, too little time, but these interns always find time for the personal stories of their patients and, this is where the shows true colors come shining through. The humanness of physicians and the people they care for; the love and dedication it takes to help someone become well, and the sadness and gloom of a death.  The open heart surgery in an elevator by a first year surgical intern is hard to believe, but somehow it works.  This is a TV show that works as well. The personalities ring true; we like them, we want them to succeed. Highly recommended. prisrob

$review_text.: It's so wonderful to be able to have DVDs of one of my favorite shows, "The Avengers." This is 2010, and I just heard there's a new movie coming out titled "The Avengers."  Imagine my disappointment when I found out it's about a group of comic book superheroes, and not a replacement for that horrible, miscast Avengers movie they made in the '90s


At least with these DVDs, I can still have fun with the Avengers I know as friends.Unlike some, I like all five women in Steed's life: Cathy Gale, Emma Peel, Tara King, Lady Diana Forbes-Blakeney, and Purdy


I can still see Tara King assuming a stance in miniskirt and boots, blasting away with a machine gun
But no doubt Emma Peel is the best remembered, especially by Americans since she was the first Avenger we saw


All of Steed's women had respectable British properness, but underneath all that was this element of delicious mischief


To my taste, they were some of the sexiest women to ever walk the earth.One of the main reasons is that their sexuality was never overt, but always hinted at


The Amazon.com reviewer mentioned one example of the sexy banter between Steed and Mrs


Peel


Another one I remember quite well was in one of the black-and-white episodes when Mrs
Peel, wearing a somewhat low-cut evening gown, is going to visit a phrenologist (a person who reads character by the bumps on your head) to get some information out of him
Steed remarks, "If that doesn't work, just show him your bumps." Her mind elsewhere, she looks at Steed blankly and says, "Hmmmmm?"

$REVIEW.: More impressive than the photography, soundtrack and editing to me are the characters in this film. Their relationships are so achingly well-realized I can't take my eyes away. In all the scenes between Cage and Arquette you  can see how desperately he's fallen for her, and how coldly she turns him  away. There's a love story in this film as tender, realistic and honest as  &quot;Marty&quot; (1955). For me the most touching example of this is when  Frank rather pathetically lifts up a piece of pizza and offers it to Mary,  and looking down, she says &quot;I'm not hungry&quot;. He puts it down and  as she starts to talk again, without even thinking she picks up the slice  and starts eating it. Arquette's performance in this film is highly  underappreciated, but then again,  that goes for everything about Bringing  out the Dead.

$REVIEW.: I went into this movie expecting to see something I hadn't seen.  There are alot of cool actors in here, so I was expecting some good characters too.  Well, there is nothing in this movie you haven't seen before.  There is absolutely NO visual style at all.  There is no soundtrack.  Every shot is hand held.  This would make a good HBO movie, but it's pretty average.  Who are we supposed to root for?  I don't think we're supposed to root for the Nazis.  How can we root for the Jews who are fighting against the other Jews to get "special privileges"?  There is really no character development, I never learned anyones name and it was sort of difficult to figure out what the plot was about.  With only 2 powerful scenes at tops, this movie can't dig itself out of the average pit.

$REVIEW.: This is the perfect Christmas gift to get any member of the group of free-loading moochers you call your friends

 It's the perfect excuse to have a movie night at THEIR house, and make them ante up some wine, cheese, grapes and lots of chocolate, then hunker down for an evening of cornball romantic comedy with a difference.Chances are, with Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman on show, you won't even notice that the storyline is hardly Pulitzer Prize material, but you do stand the chance of busting a seam when Hugh does his Footloose/Saturday Night Fever/Risky Business impression at Lot 10 Downing Street, and Bill Nighy makes like Robert Palmer for a video shoot of the worst ever chart topping Christmas song
 There's also the incomparable Rowan Atkinson, making like Mr.Bean at appropriately inopportune moments.In case you think it's all about the guys (it is - but one can't take sides) there's a brilliant performance by Emma Thompson, and also Laura Linney, who has the worst cell phone ring tone ever invented

 Keira Knightley is more "Bend It Like Beckham" than "Pirates of the Caribbean" in this one, feigning wide open surprise a little too often

She's cute though, even if I always get her mixed up with Natalie Portman, the Amidala girl.There are enough love stories and love disasters here to sink a luxury liner - and yes, there are "Titanic" references too

 Even though the couples are for the most part separate little stories, there's a connection running through the movie that really ties them all together.The music is great, the movie is funny, and your friends will have to entertain you at their expense - what more could you ask from a movie?  Did I mention it has Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Alan Rickman?Amanda Richards, November 17, 2004

$REVIEW.: Like all works of art that have dared to push the boundaries of their respective mediums, Dancer in the Dark is a film that is just as widely hated as it is loved. Some critics have lauded the film as a work of brilliant originality, while others have denounced it as pretentious and self-indulgent. Admittedly, this controversy was one of the reasons I was eager to see the film for myself. Well, by the end of this two-and-a-half hour musical-drama, the handful of men and women sitting with me in the small art house theater were either too stunned to speak or so overwhelmed with emotion that they were reduced to fitful sobs. When the credits hit, there was a guarded applause.Sure, von Trier's post-Dogma 95 film still adheres to many of the tenets of that minimalist movement of which he was a cofounder, and in doing so, there are moments in the film that reek of artistic self-importance. But even the most hardened cynic cannot walk out of this film without being affected by the shattering power of Bjork's performance or the ingenious directorial artistry that von Trier evinces in telling her story and, more impressively, in making us care about it. As Selma -- the Czech immigrant factory worker who is slowly losing her eyesight -- Bjork is able to surpass the melodramatic tendencies of the script and piece together a human portrait so honest and poignant that it is nearly impossible to walk out of this film without being haunted by it.Sure, the film deals with tough subject matter and is often quite sad, but I wouldn't call it depressing. For me, the term &quot;depressing&quot; applies to a situation that is devoid of hope or is burdened by the overwhelming weight of hopelessness. Though Dancer in the Dark is about a woman laden with miserable circumstances, which increasingly worsen as the film progresses, von Trier always makes it clear that Selma is actively in control of her destiny. She consciously makes the decisions that lead to the state that we leave her in at the end of the film, and knowing this makes her fate somewhat more bearable.It seems that as the art house/indie film world is gradually blending into the mainstream, and filmgoers are becoming more and more savvy and are expecting more from cinema than just entertainment, people are also becoming overly critical of films to the point that the emotional magic of the movies is slowly being phased out. Dancer in the Dark is a film that is unabashedly outright in its artistic extremes and disarmingly honest in its emotional manipulation, but in the capable hands of gifted, compassionate artists like Lars von Trier and Bjork (who composed and performed the astonishing soundtrack), it is a film that obliterates the restrictive floodgates of contemporary cynicism and allows one to both weep and revel at the delicacy and the intricacies of the human condition.

$review_text.: Antonio Banderas plays Ned Cruz a gumshoe who is hired by a Russian boxer, Anton 'The Pro' Protopov, (Robert Maillet) to find a stripper

Banderas does the typical gumshoe first person narration which turns out really sad due to his accent


In a comic boxing scene Anton crushes his opponent in the boxing ring, then suddenly remembers to take a dive
His quest involves a twisted plot which includes the porn industry which is shooting a movie called "The Black Hole" in a building called "Schrodingers", and a string of murders which follows Banderas as he searches for Lexie (Sienna Guillory).Eventually Bandaras travels to New Mexico from California (was that the sunset he was driving into?) and goes to a restaurant called "Planck's Constant" (What? No Beta Bar?) Clearly if you haven't had a little atomic physics in your life, you are not going to get the little subtleties


The search for the missing person becomes metaphoric as searching for a theoretical particle

However if you can't figure it out, the movie explains it you.The comical lines spoken by Banderas were good, but it was like having someone who can't tell a joke tell you a real funny joke
Someone like a younger Bruce Willis needed to play that role

If you are going to create a movie which is a metaphor, don't explain it in the movie

The audience is supposed to figure it out for themselves


Sam Elliot was good
This could have easily been a cult classic in the style of Tarantino, but having Banderas as the lead and explaining the metaphor in the film ruined it

Ending was good.Autumn Reeser from "World According To BARNS" plays a waitress
(Sorry, I had to add another nuclear physics reference.)Contain F-bomb, a physics lesson with sex and nudity

And a lesson from the film: Never film yourself having sex with an albino dwarf.

$REVIEW.: Of the several DVDs of the five-act Italian DON CARLO, this 2013 Salzburg Festival contribution to the Verdi bicentennial is easily the longest at 237 minutes. The following textual variants and rarities appear: (1) As in the 1980 and 1983 Met performances of the Dexter production, also featuring a generous edition, the opera begins with the introduction and chorus, the scene among the war-deprived French people, and Elisabetta's act of charity. (2) Rodrigo's description of the conditions of Flanders is spliced into his first scene with Carlo. (3) Act III begins with the costume exchange for Elisabetta and Eboli. The ballet is not performed; Eboli's reverie leads seamlessly into Carlo's "Mezzanotte!" We thus lose Verdi's lovely prelude for this act, most often heard in Italian five-act performances. (4) In Act IV Scene 2, there is the episode for tenor, bass, and chorus in which Carlo and Filippo mourn Rodrigo to a melody Verdi reused as the Lacrimosa of the Requiem. (5) When the people storm the prison and demand the Infante, Filippo challenges them at greater length. Eboli does not appear and tell Carlo to flee in this version of the scene; indeed, Carlo remains hunched over the dead body until the curtain closes. (6) When Carlo V pulls his grandson behind the grate, the opera ends with its hushed orchestral/choral variant following Elisabetta's scream. The familiar fortissimo orchestral reprise of the monks' melody is not heard.This is conductor Antonio Pappano's third DON CARLO/S DVD, the first from the Chtelet in 1996, the second from the Royal Opera House in 2008. The first was sung in French, the later two in Italian, and each of the three differs from the others in performing edition. At Salzburg in 2013, he has attained mastery of the score -- its colors, its shapes,  its gait -- and the response of the Vienna Philharmonic is breathtaking. This is truly festival-level playing, and pungent detail is everywhere, from the brilliance of the principal cellist's reading of the solo atop Act IV, to the terrifying rumbles and whispers of the accompaniment to the Inquisitor's scene, to the sting following Eboli's confession of her greatest sin. The outburst following Posa's intemperate "Orrenda, orrenda pace! La pace &egrave; dei sepolcri!" sounds like more than the score being rent asunder; it sounds like a seismic cataclysm. Without intended slight to the distinguished cast, it is Pappano and his players, and the equally superb chorus under the direction of J&ouml;rn Hinnerk Andresen, who are the true stars of the event.Both Jonas Kaufmann and Anja Harteros take some time to get into very best form vocally, and I suspect they were husbanding their resources in consideration of their unusually lengthy assignments. Kaufmann has one of the world's great operatic voices at this time, and as usual there is much hypnotic soft singing. He approaches high notes cautiously in the Fontainebleau act; by Act III Scene 2, challenging Filippo, he is singing with abandon and panache. His acting is alert to Carlo's instability and psychological fragility, and there are some bold choices in the garden scene (he appears on the verge of cracking up when weighing the possibility of giving his papers to the King's favorite). Harteros has neither the glamour and the aptitude for detailed acting of Marina Poplavskaya (ROH) nor the stylistic and linguistic Italianate sureness of Renata Scotto and Mirella Freni (the two Met DVDs), but she has more of an Elisabetta voice than any of the three, and although she flies sharp occasionally, it is a pleasure to hear her envelop these phrases with her grand musical manner, her beauty of tone. She can also be quite affecting in her stillness, her regal poise, her gentleness, her tranquil yet deeply sad gazes. She is moving for doing less.Ekaterina Semenchuk's Eboli is promising, and delivers on much if not at all of the promise. There is enough, in other words, to suggest a great Eboli in the making, but still in early days. Once past a Veil Song that is very careful and not ideally flexible, one begins to warm to her. She has an alluring presence and a voice of fine quality and impressive scale throughout the range; both the garden scene and that in the King's study feature formidable singing. However, she was more of an authentic spitfire singing in her native language as Marina in the Met's BORIS GODUNOV. Here, as an actor, she has not entirely shaken off a certain studied blandness. There is nothing bland in Thomas Hampson's Rodrigo. He never was or will be a classic Verdi baritone in the manner of Merrill, MacNeil, Bastianini, or Cappuccilli, and the years have taken some of the nap off a once-beautiful sound -- he resorts to raw shouting a good deal in order to achieve the volume. Still, his long experience has led him to viable ways of putting the character across, and one cannot but notice the intelligence and the intensity with which he applies himself to a complex figure. There is a fierceness that keeps the character in focus, and it contrasts well with Kaufmann's equivocations and preoccupations in the title role.The veteran Matti Salminen, here Filippo, has also given many years of service, and one hears this in a strained top and a loss of dynamic finesse and color. He is a hulking figure on the stage, and in public scenes a bit of a bully. Ghiaurov, Furlanetto, and Van Dam (all on video) got more dimension and poignancy into the character, and all seemed to me to confront the music with more suitable voices. Salminen is not terribly dynamic physically either, or is not directed to be, sitting at his desk and barely reacting when his young wife runs in demanding justice, and smirking when confronting her with the jewel casket. Salminen is not a total writeoff, being convincingly "senior" as well as convincingly intimidating, but one may have the feeling that King Marke or Hagen has wandered into the wrong opera. Eric Halfvarson was the Grand Inquisitor on both of Pappano's previous DVDs, and returns here, as does Robert Lloyd as Carlo V (from the ROH DVD) -- both are assured and professional and do not surprise. From among smaller roles, Benjamin Bernheim may be the best Count Lerma/Herald I have ever heard; I found myself sitting up and taking notice.Peter Stein's production follows the modern trajectory one can trace elsewhere in the work of Luc Bondy (Chtelet) and Nicholas Hytner (ROH, later seen at the Met). Ferdinand W&ouml;gerbauer's set designs are spare and utilitarian, probably created in part with an eye toward ease and speed of scene changes in this long work. The lavish shows of Visconti, Dexter, and Zeffirelli (all of which are on DVD, the Dexter twice) seem of another era. Even with that allowance made, the production does not strongly suggest a time and place, and the only scene that is really striking to the eye is the beginning of II/2, for Eboli, Tebaldo, and the women, subsequently joined by the Queen and Rodrigo, which takes place beside a decorative pool, the dominant color a soothing sea-foam green. Stein makes some choices I question (why are three ladies-in-waiting visible chatting in the background of the fraught confrontation between Elisabetta and Carlo, when Elisabetta having been left unattended is a major plot point?). It would have been fair to expect more distinction in the handling of the personalities from the director, considering his experience and reputation and the eight weeks of rehearsal he had with the cast, but this is efficient work that does not get in anyone's way and lets the opera make its points. Joachim Barth's lighting is expressive, and the video direction of Agnes M&egrave;th gives us many welcome wide shots of one of the largest indoor stages in the world.The second of the two Met DVDs, the 1983, provides an opulent traditional production, superbly played under James Levine, with several great 20th-century singers in roles with which they are closely associated. The ROH 2008 cannot be easily overlooked for the moving performances of Furlanetto and Poplavskaya as the royal couple. But the new Salzburg provides more music than either, and while it does not score in every specific, it is as good a DON CARLO/S DVD as we have had or are likely to have.

$REVIEW.: Well when I was a kid I couldn't get into the film...However this cartoon makes up for all the questions I hadOne when you die, why can't you leave your house but go to sandworm land and so on and so forth.  Besides Beetlejuice was hardly in the film.  Here in the cartoon he was finally the star, Lydia was aged down to 12 and looks like the character from Frankenweenie.  You get a better idea of the neither world, and I loved the characters Ginger the tap dancing spider, Jock La Lean the skeleton obsessed with working out, The monster across the street (who looks like Gossimer from Looney Tunes...all in all loved the cross between the living and the dead.  Cons, no Adam and Barbara Maitland, no special features.  Pros you get four seasons of a toung in cheek 80's/90's cartoon that made up for the film.

$review_text.: This movie starts out OK. It's well filmed and has a bunch of solid British actors, some of whom were quite young here but went on to great things.The plot is also intriguing, there aren't many movies about the activities of the Long Range Desert Group.But the downside? The music, what there is of it, is the worst of British military movie music. There is one tune, and it sounds like a march played on a parade ground. Fortunately they don't play much music in the movie.The real killer is that you've seen this movie before, in bits and pieces. Every imaginable cliche from every lame WW2 movie is included here, with very little variation. The result is very unsatisfactory.By the end of the movie you will feel you've wasted a perfectly good hour or so. You will wish you'd watched "Ice Cold in Alex" for the 100th time rather than this potboiler.

$REVIEW.: These movies are great fun, the sequels are sort of weak story wise but still get the job done entertainment wise. I think for the 4th one that here Spielberg might be doing, they need a fresher story. I think they should just go ahead and make Jurassic Park an actual theme park already and dump the whole &quot;I hate this island but I'm here anyway bit&quot;.  The whole theme park thing would be cool and would allow just regular people there and not just scientists or hunters like in the others.  Of course one or 2 actors from the original or sequels should return but I think it should be a less known character, like Vince Vaughn's from the Lost World. Could possibly even have one of the kids from the original return as a grownup.Well anyway, anybody that's into  Dinosaurs should love these films, it has every type you can think of.  Plus even if you're not you should still enjoy them, they're just flat out fun pop-corn movies.

$review_text.: Can you deal with the Coen Brothers hitting the mainstream? If yes, you will probably like this movie

If not, you may be a bit dissapointed

This isn't my favorite Coen brothers movie, but it is worth seeing

 It has a lot of the trademark Coen oddities in characters, dialogue, wit, and dark, biting humor, but it moves into a realm left relatively untouched by the Coen's by introducing more elements of the traditional romantic comedy than seen in their previous works


Not to mention the casting of high profile stars (though I seem to remember a film of theirs starring Holly Hunter and Nicholas Cage...hmmm) and some transparency in plotline


That being said...I liked the film

It was one that I had no expectations of and found myself having fun watching it


If you want a straight up Coen Brothers original this won't be the movie for you
If you want a romantic comedy that has obviously been crafted by the masters and are willing to let some things go with regards to style points...you'll really enjoy this movie.

$review_text.: The opening moments of this film are some of the most simple, gripping, shocking camera shots ever devised. Seeing New York city overrun by nature with absolutely no hint of human life definitely struck a nerve with both me and the audience, and the best part is that the camera never tries to show off the impressive visual effects (most of which are entirely invisible). The focus is on the main character, as it should be, as well as how the outbreak happened and how he struggles to fix what he started. Millions of "Virus Outbreak Mutation" films have been devised over the past few decades, which makes I Am Legend even that much more impressive. It never feels like it belongs in the genre due to the multi-layered nature of the piece, as well as the clever progression and documentary-like feel.Francis Lawrence made an impressive debut with Constantine, and I Am Legend proves that he's on track to becoming one of the defining filmmakers of our generation, just as Spielberg and Scorsese defined their's.

$REVIEW.: Consider this a warning beacon.Imagine yourself aboard the Nostromo, the big humongo spooky ore-freighter from the first Alien movie. The crew of the Nostromo---Dallas, Ripley, the union guys who keep ragging about the 'bonus situation, the cat---get a distress beacon to a hunk of blasted rock in deep space with an atmosphere of howling battery acid. Cheery place.They go visit & get all touristy---you know, bring back trinkets, drink the water---and come back with a real nasty stomach Bug that even Pepto-Bismol couldn't get rid of.Now: if they had a warning beacon, they would have stayed away. They would have lived. So this is my WARNING BEACON: stay away. Live. Raise children. I saw this movie. My brain melted down & suffered heat death & got all runny & wilted like a pancake in Death Valley, so *yours* doesn't have to.Be warned: this movie will destroy brain cells. If you ignore my warning, & watch this flick, you will actually feel yourself getting stupider (a word that, while not grammatically correct, does indeed apply to "Cemetery Gates").OK: Take a good look at the cover of "Cemetery Gates". Pretty cool, huh? Big, hulking, shadowy thing with red eyes lurking outside the gothic gateway to an old Victorian necropolis. Again, take a good look: that's the only time you're going to see that scene anywhere near this flick, or anything else that's even remotely cool.Basically, "Cemetery Gates" is about what happens when a film crew shooting a horror flick in a cemetery run into a giant mutant Tasmanian Devil. I've always wondered how an encounter like that would work out, and this flick provides the answer.Suffice it to say that the Tasmanian Devil, who looks like a rotting Snuffleupagus, isn't there to discuss the fine points of bilateral diplomacy. Blood flows. Cheap special effects flow. Booze, if you're lucky, flows. Film crew takes a bunch of dirt knaps. The 7th Trumpet of the Apocalypse is Blown from making a flick this consummately [EXPLETIVE], & Hell is unleashed upon the Earth.Bummer.If I've made this flick seem interesting, or even mildly watchable, then consider this: I'd rather see outtakes Abe Vigoda doing nude break-dancing than watch this thing again.The acting is non-existent: the entire cast of characters acts with about half the collective IQ of a brain damaged lemur. Reggie Bannister, who has done more tours of duty in horror flicks than Frank Castle did in Vietnam, proves he would be willing to sell his grandma into white slavery if they paid him.That said, this flick does merit 2 stars, because in the final analysis it has three things going for it:1) the mutant Tasmanian Devil. Imagine what would happen if Snuffleupagus were bitten by a zombie, and you've got it. Its hairy, retarded, scrofulous backside has that same molted reddish-flanged carpet texture the Snuffleupagus had. Really took me back.2) The filmmakers spend a lot of their time capturing the Tasmanian Devil not only savaging its prey, but then expelling it in a steaming dump, followed by other characters commenting to the effect that something smells bad. For a simpleton like me, every time this happens it's just like dwarf tossing: never ceases to amuse.3) The Killer Snuffleupagus has this singular battle tactic it keeps using over & over (don't mess with success!): it charges you, knocks you down, gets on your chest, and (I jest thee not) starts scratching frantically. Yes, yes!: it scratches you to death. Like a nasty, furry, unhappy cat with a bad case of mange. Or a killer zombified Snuffleupagus.And then it poops you out, once it has had its intestinal way with you. And someone complains about the smell.Better title for this flick: "Snuffy".Better idea than watching this movie: Death.JSG

$review_text.: Any fan of Styx and REO should know, these great bands have toured together for a couple of decades
They alternate being the opening act

My wife and I caught them a couple of years ago
REO opened at an outside fair grounds and Styx followed

Just a few minutes into Styx set, a storm blew in and the sound board was "toast"

They tried to complete the show, but mother nature wasn't going to allow it
They tried to let the show go on by using the stage monitors and acoustic guitars


Luckily, we were in the front row and could hear them, but no one in the bleachers heard a sound and the band finally conceded that the  concert was over.This is a very good concert, but I felt like they should have made this program a two DVD set, so more of each bands material could have been added
My biggest regret is that Styx didn't get Crystal Ball included
Again, other than not covering more songs, this is a fun DVD to add to your collection.

$review_text.: Turning from his comedic work at Britain's Ealing Studios to direct this noirish, all-American masterpiece about greed, ambition, and the perversity of power, Alexander MacKendrick relied on estimable playwright Clifford Odets and writer Ernest Lehman for their scripting talent. What resulted was one of the most cynical, caustic films ever made about the sleazy underbelly of Manhattan show business, featuring blistering performances from Lancaster and a young Curtis in his prime. "I love this dirty town," proclaims the Walter Winchell-esque Hunsecker, and you never once doubt him. Sinister, tawdry, and burnished with a tone-perfect jazz score by Elmer Bernstein, "Success" was never this twisted.

He's a grittier and nastier version of Rooster.  Matt Damon is so much better than Glen Campbell was in the role of the Texas Ranger, and the young girl who plays Mattie is an absolute revelation.The Coen brothers have remade a classic and iconic film, and this remake will itself become a classic I am sure.  It's realistic, dirty, violent and harsh, as life really was for people who lived in the "wild west" during that time.  But it also has at its heart the story of young Mattie whose unwavering devotion to her father and true grit of her own lead us all on an unforgettable adventure.This movie gives us a little more of an ending than the original even showing the grown up Mattie and letting us know what became of Marshall Cogburn.For fans of westerns and especially fans of the original True Grit, you shouldn't miss this movie.

$review_text.: Part of me really hates Adam Sandler.  It's a pretty big part, and yet this little part that keeps kicking me in the ribs tells me that he has his moments and when he has them they are really good.  Sadly, outside of '50 First Dates' (which rested largely on the capable shoulders of my beau Drew Barrymore), Sandler hasn't gotten anything right since the late 90's (remember with fondness when his goofball shtick was new and cool and produced hilarity like `Happy Gilmore' and `Big Daddy').  While this borderline train wreck is no where near as atrocious as `Little Nicky', it is far less inspired and far duller by comparison.  The gags are hit and miss, and when they hit they barely register with a chuckle.  In fact, I remember laughing out loud ONCE in the theater (during the `mo fo' instant message) and upon reflection it's really not that funny.  Sandler plays his usual buffoon with a heart of gold and Winona Ryder is as clich&eacute; as they come (she needs to make a REAL comeback soon, before everyone forgets she ever existed and her clone, Natalie Portman, takes over completely).  Everything about the foot fetishist butler is cringe worthy (I mean AWFUL).  This is a snooze, but whatever, it's Sandler...you kind of have to expect to hate most of what he does by now.

$REVIEW.: Just commenting on the sun-salute --Sara Ivanhoe does a great job. She does more of a modified sun-salutation, but fine. I think she enriches it.She models it for you, and you follow her. My only pet-peeve, is that she doesn't explain, at all, what it is. If it were more clear, perhaps it would be more meaningful.The book, Yoga for Dummies, by the way, is great. They explain, that the sun-salutation is a 'dynamic posture,' meaning, as I understand it, a series of moving stretches, like, a flowing stretch routine.Flowing stretch routines are really good if you want to build strength and flexibility. The Sun Salutation really helps me with that. This workout is really good for your spine and lungs.Back to the yoga book, (bear with me here) we benefit from the sun's life-giving powers. (Like, no sun, no life) Feuerstein and Payne say remember that your body is condensed sunlight! So, from a spiritual viewpoint, the light in you (your spirit) salutes its own provider, the sun itself.As far as the ''workout'' goes, it is 5 min. of warm-up, that she flows into the sun-salute. She presents the sun salute, adding the components, piece by piece. It is about 15 min of more strenuous reps. She does about 10 minutes of cool-down, including spine-twist seated-stretches (you have to see it).Great video. I do use it all the time. It is applicable to all levels. For a beginner, this is a total workout. For the expert, it is an interesting variation of a very established set of postures.

The animation obviously won't appeal to some anime fans especially those who have become used to the CGI animation and effects of the last ten years or so.  Still the price of the set is very affordable especially how hard this series was to get a reasonable price before Funimation re-released it, so for any fan who likes the harem sci-fi comedy anime here's a great one to look at but please do yourself a favor and just listen to the series subbed while it might annoy having to read the subtitle trust me it's a better option then listening to the atrocious dubbing and never quite able to forget about again sadly.....

Now come on that is a pretty dumb thing to have, is one widescreen copy, and a few copies at least 2 copies I believe in full screen
But soon, I hopefully will have it in my dvd in widescreen, and one of the ones that could add me getting in full screen, if somebody gives it to me as a gift, but in full screen


But I now plenty of on-line stores like this one, will have this movie in both formates, in their invetory, and very rarely do I get, if at all that I buy a movie on-line, that it is not in the screen, or wrong idems I wanted

It is 1995, and Stan Ross (Bernie Mac) is playing the Bostn Red Sox in a game, and hte Red Sox pitcher keeps saying that won't be the guy he will get his 3,000 hit off of, but he does, and then he makes a sudden/unexpected annoucememntr, that he plans to retire right away from the game of baseball

Now it is 9 years later, Stan owns a bar, and a mall, with the name Mr


3000, and then he gets a freind to talk the Milwaukee Brewers into retiring his number, even though of un popluar he was when he played

But after the ceremony, it is disovered that Stan has only 3 hits shy of 3,000 hits, and stan makes a decison, even through he is now 47 years old, to sign back with the Brewers, even through how much the team's president (Chris Noth), wants not her from him again, agrees to re-sign, and a reporter from ESPN is picked to cover this story (Angela Bassett) who knows him well, and just asks him what if he doesn't get his 3,000 hit.

$REVIEW.: I like new movies with special effects as much as the next girl, but there is something about live theater that always leaves me breathless.  Whether its the enchanting music of the "Phantom of the Opera" or a rendition of  Shakespeare's prose, I almost always find myself in tears at the end of a stage performance. And there is something that makes Shakespeare even more endearing when its preformed with an authentic English accent. So I was excited to get the chance to review the "Discovering Hamlet" DVD ."Discovering Hamlet" takes you behind the scenes at the staging of Hamlet. Back in 1988, rising star Kenneth Branagh had just landed the role of the Prince of Denmark with the help and guidance of Emmy winning actor Derek Jacobi. He eventually earned the  title of the "best Hamlet of his generation" by the New York Times. He eventually brought Hamlet to life on the silver screen. This exciting documentary, narrated by Patrick Stewart,  lets you follow the cast and crew through four weeks of rehearsals all the way through to opening night. You learn about costume design, text advisers and more.  You will find exclusive interviews, behind the scenes footage, and even learn about the history of the Renaissance theater. You will get an inside look at the work involved in bringing a play to life, which will give you even more appreciation of this amazing art form.***Complimentary product received in exchange for an honest review***

$REVIEW.: To quote John Mellencamp, this "little ditty `bout Jack and Diane" called "Something's Gotta Give" is somewhat of a sleeper comedy nowadays but still managed to give Diane Keaton a Golden Globe for Best Actress (as well as an Academy Award nomination) in 2004.  Co-star Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Golden Globe as well for his performance and these are two of the best reasons to watch the film.Keaton is Erica Barry, a divorcee and accomplished playwright who decides to spend some time at her beach house in the summer with her sister Zoe (McDormand).  When she arrives, she is shocked to find a man digging around in her fridge, clothed only in his oxford shirt, boxers and dress socks.  With Erica threatening to phone the police, the man quickly introduces himself as Harry Sanborn (Nicholson) and explains that he is there with her daughter Marin (Peete) for the weekend.  Embarrassed that he has been caught in his skivvies, he insists that he will leave but Zoe pipes in, suggesting that all four of them spend some quality time.  This is where the fun begins.Over dinner that evening, Erica quickly learns that Harry is a chauvinistic playboy, Marin another notch on the belt of his quest to desperately cling to his youth.  Harry senses Erica's disdain not only for his capricious behavior but also her disapproval of his relationship with Marin and reciprocates the hostility, quite certain that they will not get along no matter what happens.  What neither of them bank on is keeping up the venomous front for several weeks while Harry recovers from a heart attack he suffers that night.At the urging of his doctor Julian Mercer (Reeves), Harry recuperates close to the hospital, Erica reluctantly providing hospice.  Born out of what is at first an irksome period is a surprising camaraderie and eventual love affair, one that turns Erica's world upside down.  Aside from her exhilarating dalliances with Harry, she is simultaneously squired by the handsome Julian, a man nearly half her age.  Erica's once ho-hum life is thrown into an emotional upheaval, her heart quickly set aflame and just as quickly extinguished by the wayward Harry.  Not one to let a broken heart disrupt her life completely, she uses her romantic foibles as the primary tool for penning another successful play, one which more or less tells the entire story of her brief romance.Screenwriter and director Nancy Meyers wrote the parts of Erica and Harry with Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson specifically in mind to play them and they are smart casting choices indeed.  The best pairing since Nicholson himself and Shirley MacLaine in 1983's "Terms of Endearment", Erica and Harry are that couple least likely to succeed but when they fall for one another they fall harder than one would care to predict, despite their vastly different personalities and ideals.  Keaton prevails with the comedic timing she possesses in spades whilst Nicholson is the wry and strangely sexy older man that he's so fond of playing.  Reeves, normally armed with the dramatic prowess of knotty pine, is surprisingly looser and warmer here, the most natural and enjoyable performance I've ever seen; for such a minor role, it's without a doubt his best so far.Bottom line: It's obvious at first glance what the film's strong suits are (screenplay and lead actors) and both are in top form here.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a reason not to see two film veterans at the top of their game in one of the better romantic comedies of 2003.

$REVIEW.: I must say that I really don't like movies made in the 70' because I a child of the computer generated film.  However, that said, this movie is breathtaking.  I think this movie insipires a side men that has been lost since WWII.  Of all the genre of war I like this movie the best.  I was overwhelmed by George C Scotts potrayal of Patton.  His facial expression and eyes seemed war torn and battled.  I think the cast director deserved an oscar.  Scott's acting is awesome.  One of my favorite scenes is the contrite patton beseeching the Lord for another command.  I must say that is the best of Hollywood.As the movie says Patton was made for war.  My favorite line of the movie..&quot;God help me I do love it so...&quot;.  That has to be the overall tempo of the movie a man who loved war for simplicity of war itself.  In short this movie is well worth 3 hours.  If you like war, WWII, or historical movies this is a must.I could watch this movie every week.
$SUMMARY.: Awesome

For some reason Disney doesn't think there's much of a market for 3d animation here in the states. It was a mistake to test this hypothesis on this film. Good musical featuring the powerful voice of Idina Menzel. Your kids will love Olaf the Snowman and Sven the Reindeer. If you can, get the 3d version or in any case just get it.

$REVIEW.: Wow, I give this movie 5 stars. Steve Austin performance was Amazing for him to do. Usually, we see him in these beat em' up movies and his character is quiet and doesn't talk too much. But, wow, this movie give him a chance to show off his true acting skills and he pulled it off.Maybe the other actors weren't as amazing, but Steve made them better. The story was good as well. With Steve in the movie, he managed to pull together a great movie, where you believed he was trying to help a kid to become a winner. Everyone else was telling the kid to quit and do something else. But, Steve was there to picked him up, helped him out of real trouble, and pushed him to "just go for it!"What I learned from the movie is that's Real Fighters don't run away, they stands tall and Fight! It's okay to be afraid, but what you do about matters. Even if you lose, you stilled tried. If you don't try, you lost already. Steve said these things and I believed him. :)

Sure, this film "borrows" from many predecessors, but still hits the mark with its message.  Garner convincingly plays a girl who wishes she was 30 on her 13th birthday.  After some "Wishing Dust" sprinkles on her...you know the rest.  Ruffalo gives an excellent performance as "once friend" Matt, who helps her rediscover herself in her most desperate hour.Things could have been a little more "clean and punchy" in this movie, but overall a pretty good job.  I might even buy this one because it is a definite "Feel Good Movie"...and we all need those!

The picture quality on the DVD is magnificent and there is no logo. If I had a complaint, it would be too many episodes on one disc. Sometimes that makes discs get scratched sooner with more handling. But then again, the number of discs sometimes determines the retail price and this set is under priced.

$review_text.: After the publication of Michael Ondaatje's Booker-Prize-winning "English Patient," conventional wisdom soon held that the novel, while a masterpiece of fiction, was entirely untransferable to any other medium: too intricately layered seemed its narrative structure; too significant its protagonists' inner life; too rich its symbolism

Then along came Anthony Minghella, who reportedly read it in a single sitting and was so disoriented afterwards that he didn't even remember where he was - but who called producer Paul Zaentz the very next morning and talked him into bringing the novel to the screen
Two major studios and several fights over the casting of key roles later, the result were an astonishing nine Oscars (Best Picture, Director - Anthony Minghella -, Supporting Actress - Juliette Binoche -, Cinematography, Editing, Art Direction, Costume Design, Original Score and Sound), as well as scores of other awards."The English Patient" is an epic tale of love and loss; of ownership, belonging and the bars erected thereto
It unites the stories of five people: Hungarian count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), mistaken as English by a British Army medical unit in Italy after professing to have forgotten his identity; Hana (Juliette Binoche), Almasy's Canadian nurse; Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas), his erstwhile lover; Kip (Naveen Andrews), a Sikh sapper and Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), an ex-spy and thief

All outsiders, they are struggling to come to terms with their lives: Almasy, on his deathbed, reflects back to his life as a North African explorer and his affair with Katherine; Hana believes herself cursed because everybody she cares for dies (in the movie her fiance and her best friend; in the novel her fiance, her father and her unborn baby), Katherine is taken to an all-male company of explorers in Cairo by her husband Geoffrey (Colin Firth), Kip, like Hana, is far away from home (the only Indian in an otherwise British and Italian environment) and Caravaggio lost his livelihood after his thumbs were cut off in captivity by the Germans, on a sadistic officer (Juergen Prochnow)'s orders.Like the novel, the movie's story largely unfolds in flashbacks: After Hana convinces her superiors to let her stay and nurse Almasy in an abandoned Tuscan villa, she and new arrival Caravaggio, who holds Almasy responsible for his fate, extract the details of his life in Africa and the truth about Katherine, Geoffrey and the events uniting him with the Cliftons and Caravaggio from Almasy in a series of conversations

But at the same time, the story is anchored in the present by Hana's growing attachment to Kip, which shines a different light on the themes also driving Almasy and his relationship with Katherine


The film's outstanding cast, which in key roles also includes Julian Wadham as Almasy's friend Madox and Kevin Whately as Kip's sergeant Hardy carries the story marvelously: Probably their biggest award loss (besides Fiennes's and Scott Thomas's Oscar and other "best lead" nominations and Minghella's screenplay Oscar nomination) was the 1997 SAG ensemble award, which instead went to "The Birdcage."In his screenplay Minghella made several changes vis-a-vis the novel; the biggest of these doubtlessly a shift in focus from Hana, Caravaggio and Kip to Almasy and Katherine, and the fact that the film is much more explicit about Almasy's identity than the novel

Both were wise choices: Hana's inner demons in the novel are largely exactly that - *inner* demons, moreover, substantially grounded in the past and thus even more difficult to portray than Almasy's and Katherine's
Similarly, once the focus had moved to the latter couple, Kip's back story would have extended the movie without significantly advancing it; and the same is true for the intersections between Caravaggio's path and that of Hana's father
Secondly, mistaken *national* identity is overall more central to Almasy's character than identity as such; so the novel's intricate mystery about his persona might well have proven unnecessarily distracting in the movie's context

Indeed, once Almasy had become the story's greatest focus, much of its symbolism virtually even required that there be no real doubt about his identity.But in all core respects, Minghella remained faithful to Ondaatje's novel; particularly regarding its profoundly impressionistic imagery, as shown, for example, in the curves formed by the Northern African desert's endless sand dunes, which in John Seale's magnificent and justly awardwinning cinematography resemble those of a woman's body as much as they do in Ondaatje's language, thus uniting Almasy's two greatest loves in a single symbol.Doubtlessly the most important image is that of maps: Guides to unknown places like those drawn by Almasy and his friends during their explorations, but also tools of ownership like the cartography of Northern Africa made possible by Geoffrey Clifton's photos, and ultimately symbols of betrayal, as Almasy surrenders his maps to the Germans in exchange for a plane after he feels deserted by the British


And while Kip, who spends all day searching for bombs but wants to be found at night, guides Hana to himself by a series of tiny signposts in the form of oil lamps - but still never tries to expect her, in order not to get too much attached to her - Almasy, the perpetual loner who declares that he hates ownership more than anything else, gets so attached to Katherine that he claims her suprasternal notch as his exclusive property and later refers to her as his wife, which due to her marriage to Geoffrey she couldn't truly be in life and could only symbolically become in death

- The final word on maps, belonging and ownership, however, is part of Katherine's legacy to Almasy (and I still prefer the novel's language here):"I believe in such cartography - to be marked by nature, not just label ourselves on a map like the names of rich men and women on buildings
We are communal histories, communal books
..

All I desired was to walk upon such an earth that had no maps."Also recommended:The English PatientSecret Life of Laszlo AlmasyWind, Sand and StarsNight FlightAnil's Ghost: A NovelThe End of the AffairUp at the VillaChocolat (Miramax Collector's Series)The Histories (Penguin Classics)

It stars Henry Thomas from E.T. and Dabney Coleman from Nine To Five, they were both great and so was Christina Nigra who played Kim. It was nice to see Dabney Coleman playing a nice likeable character other than the obnoxsious, arrogant characters which he is most known for. Cloak and Dagger is very highly recommended and I hope they release this on DVD!

$REVIEW.: A highly popular date movie in the mid sixties, Claude Lelouch's Oscar-winning "A Man and a Woman" may owe its innovative visual style to the French New Wave, but at its heart is a very simple love story, as the title implies
Flashing back and forward in time, switching from color stock to black-and-white, Lelouch tells the tale of these two lovers with stylistic panache and a dizzyingly romantic tone underscored by Francis Lai's lilting, memorable score

Love, as only the French know how to do it.

$REVIEW.: Like a freight juggernaut carrying the poisoned cargo of a screwed-up past coupled to a temptation-filled present - ex convict Jack Jordan is a train wreck waiting to derail yet again - only this time in spectacular fashion


At least at the hands of Preacher John (the ever stunning Eddie Marsan) Jack has discovered God and this has given him strength ("Jesus gave me that truck...")


But he still seems to be heading for that mental meltdown no matter how hard he believes and the inevitable loss of his freedom, his job and his family.Mexican Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu had made the brilliant "Amos Perres" in 2000 and it went a long way to drawing in huge talent like Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and especially Benicio Del Toro (as Jack Jordan)

Not conventionally structured - 2004's "21 Grams" uses the device of back and forward in time flashbacks to offer up a story of accidents and loss and extreme pain and how ordinary people cope with it (or not as the case may be).The structure is odd and at times grating - but it brilliantly unfolds the story so you slowly twig what's happened and to whom

One minute Jack Jordan is clean-shaven happily waving to his friends by his pick-up - the next he's in a prison shower again with a towel around his neck (and he isn't trying to clear up his zits)

Sean Penn's character Paul River's is wheezing on a ventilator while he sneaks a cigarette from a pill bottle stash in the bathroom in one scene - then is healthy and immaculately suited in the next scene as he ogles a woman in a swimming pool (Naomi Watts) he seems overly interested in for a married man


One moment he's raising a glass of wine with his friends celebrating an organ transplant that has literally saved his life - the next Paul is lying in a hospital bed looking battered with tubes in his mouth - ruminating on the size of the bodyweight you lose when you die (the film's title).In between all of this we keep returning to a father (a brilliantly subtle Danny Huston) on his mobile to his wife

He is clearly not paying enough attention to his two young daughters giddily chasing a bird on the footpath ahead of him
As the three pass out of shot - leaves are blown ahead as a familiar-looking truck races past - and a few moments later (still out of shot) there's an ominous screech of tyres...While Sean Penn is typically magnetic - the movie belongs to Benicio Del Toro who straddles it like a malevolent colossus

In the 'Making Of' the Director says you need only point the camera at him and magic will happen - worlds going on behind a glance

Yet somehow (and there are repulsive scenes with his family) Del Toro fills his tattooed enraged Jordan with such gravitas that you empathise with his gradual loss of faith rather than judge him
In one scene he begs a startled man to kill him - end his torment - and you don't for a second think that he doesn't really mean it.But special praise should also go to the women who are simply astounding and in some cases act the showier male names off the frame
Charlotte Gainsbourg plays Sean Penn's wife Mary Rivers obsessed with having a child even if their relationship is disintegrating - while Melissa Leo plays the wife of the God-obsessed Jack Gordon trying to keep him out of jail and her family together (both are simply superb)


But it's Naomi Watts who blows you away
There is a scene where she has to go the hospital to check on her husband and two daughters only to be given unfathomable news
As a parent you physically shake and ache with her harrowing disintegration (she's that good)
The only other times I've ever seen this sheer acting power is in "Bright Star" about the life of poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne that has Abbie Cornish give the same kind of mind-blowing performance (see review) and Marion Cotillard's unbelievable performance in the Edith Piaf biopic "La Vie En Rose".With a 1.85:1 Aspect Ratio (the full screen is filled) 'adequate' best describes the BLU RAY picture quality


It isn't great by any stretch of the imagination featuring many indoor and night scenes with an ever-present pallor of grain
Shooting was all about feel and immediacy - and prettily framed suburbia was never going to be part of the equation
But I'd still say that the power of the watch quickly dissipates any qualms on that front


The only subtitle is English for the Hard Of Hearing.There's also a great "In Fragments" Making Of where the Director gets all the cast and crew to throw red roses in the air at the start of shooting and white roses when they finish

Each of the principal actors get spots and they're praise and love of the work is palatable
Icing on the cake is Gustavo Santaoialla's stunning score of electric and acoustic heavy guitar strums (like a Mexican Ry Cooder)
Gustavo also embellished "Babel" and "The Motorcycle Diaries" with the same emotion-tugging power.Nominated for 2 Oscars and 5 Baftas - "21 Grams" is visceral cinema peopled with a plethora of actors giving 1000% to a script they know is hard-hitting yet somehow real world redemptive


Inarritu would go on to make the equally brilliant "Babel" and the seriously harsh "Biutiful".In 2014 you can pick up the stunning "21 Grams" for 10 bucks on BLU RAY - and that's a ten-spot well spent in my book...

With their humor and insights, they bring the war home much better than interviews with generals or professional commentators could have done


I recommend The Thin Red Line by Terrence Malick for a lyrical treatment of the battle for Guadalcanal.

$REVIEW.: If Travolta & co

sought to pack a movie so full of plot contrivances, stupid dialogue, useless characters and pitifully bad special effects, that Ed Wood would be turning over in his grave, well then...I think I hear the sound of a coffin doing the watusi

 In plunging headfirst to a completely new standard of big-budget badness, this movie fails utterly on so many levels that it robs the viewer of the simple pleasure of camp

 Travolta plays the alien "Psychlo" known as Terl
 Terl is essentially the same obnoxious Vinnie Bah-ba-rino character from "Welcome Back Kotter", albeit with more meticulous anunciation and perhaps slightly grander designs
 He is so artificially smug that you want to smack him every time he apears on the screen

 (Unfortunately that happens to be a lot.)  Forrest Whitaker and Barry Pepper, who at least in principle appear to be reputable actors, do their best to attempt to provide subtlety and some charisma to their characters but can't do much with the godawful script


 It says something when the mind-numbing repetition of "rat brain" passes for wit

 There are countless other nameless actors who show up and quite often die in seemingly heroic ways; I found myself often comparing their friends various methods of overreacting hilariously to their comrades' deaths

 They were probably terribly agonized that it wasn't their character who got to die.The director, Roger Christian, who may or may not have been handing out flowers in an airport lobby before floating this us this turd, seems to have picked up several quirky camera tricks from other directors - and then chosen to overuse them hideously

 Truthfully people, i've seen porn that is more competently directed and edited than this


 I have to wonder if another hour of this hackneyed drudgery lies forlorn and neglected in some back studio room

 (If so, let us pray it never be found)
 Why use the same patented George Lucas screen wipe every single time?  Why the need to do every other scene in excruciating slo-motion?  And why film every other scene not in slo-motion with a tilted camera?  Remember the Taco Bell commercial where Shaq's neck permanently becomes crooked from eating tacos?  You get the idea...The production design varies from decent to cheap and kludgey, starting with the Psychlos, who look like a combination between a Klingon and a street pimp
 Extend that to the unconvincing mattes of decaying cities and various other soundstages, which make the film look convincingly like it was filmed on the backlots of a real studio when no one else was looking
 At least the ship effects look decent, although they are only marginally better than your standard FMV intro to a Playstation game.Sadly enough, I found myself trapped into watching highlights a second time (darn roommates hogging the remote!), I didn't react with nearly the amount of rising bile that the first viewing inspired

 I wondered briefly if the movie wasn't really all THAT bad, but instead I came to realize more that actually that it was the effect of defensive apathy for my life slowly draining from my body; losing forever yet another two hours that could have been far, far better spent.

$review_text.: This movie is outstanding in so many areas.  The story itself is intriging, the setting is surprising, the cast is superb and the direction and innovative use of what was then a new technology, Technicolor, has surely never been surpassed.  Learning that the entire film, set in the high Himalyas, is, in fact filmed in the studio is mind-blowing.  The sense of height, depth, distance, and perspective is just authentic-appearing!  The only scenes not filmed in the studio are two or three in which people are riding horses or something along an outside path, and they were filmed near the studio, not in India.  Yet people from India thought they recognized settings!  I consider this film a treasure in my DVD library and have already watched it several times.

A lot of detail rounded into 20 minutes. Also, using the Rome Total War graphic engine is better than using re-enactors.I think the special features section merit mentioning as you learn more information about Egyptian and Greek life.

$review_text.: There are a lot of different editions reviewed here, but as of now, the only DVD or Blu-ray with the original ending is the Sky Chrome edition which was released in 2012. There is also at least one VHS tape edition with the original ending. Most editions end before the original ending that had been lost for years.  My review is about the Sky Chrome Blu-ray edition. Though the 1957 production of Casino Royale was included as an extra in MGM's 2002 DVD release of the 1967 spoof Casino Royale (it was not included in the later 2008 40th anniversary DVD or Blu-ray release), and though I own that 2002 DVD, I decided to get the Sky Chrome edition of the 1957 production to have the complete show with the original ending. Not only does the Sky Chrome edition include the original ending, but the picture is so much better. It is an amazing restoration. The Blu-ray is very clear. I only saw the Sky Chrome Blu-ray and not the Sky Chrome DVD, but I would guess the DVD looks excellent, too. Due to its aged Kinscope source, the original ending is not as clear as the rest of the show, but it isn't bad, and it is worth having.Don't expect a slick action movie. This is a black-and-white live TV show from the early days of television. The action unfolds more like a play than a movie. The plot is based closely on part of the original novel. In this, the James Bond character is an American spy known as "Card Sense Jimmy Bond." The great Peter Lorre is excellent as the desperate villain Le Chiffre. Linda Christian, the Bond girl, is hot, but this is television from the 1950s, so don't expect to see her in a bikini.

$review_text.: I bought a Blu ray player a few months ago.  At 39 years old I was really hoping to see some of my favorite movies in this new HD format.  Some movies seem to really benefit from this format (Kubrick's re-releases, Fifth Element, etc.).  And some movies don't seem to take full advantage of the HD format.So it is with great pleasure that I say that this edition of Close Encounters of the Third Kind is quite simply "amazing!"  Yes, the film is 30 years old.  And some grain is to be expected.  But wow, what a transfer!  The colors pop off the screen.  The contrast is nice and sharp, but not in a bad way.  The dark scenes are virtually flawless.  The color tones and overall look of the entire film is breahtaking.  The audio easily makes this a reference Blu Ray disc and will really test your system.I'm not sure how much of the look of this film is due to the recent digital remastering and how much is simply due to the HD format, but the end result is enough to give you goose bumps.The movie may be 30 years old, but this transfer makes it look as though it was released this year.Worth noting is, thanks to the Blu Ray format, this release is just two discs (not 3 discs as in the standard def format).  All three versions of the film (original Theatrical release, Special Edition release, and the edition for this set, Director's Cut) are ALL on the first disc.  Disc two contains all the special features.  And there's hours of non-filler, must-watch stuff on this disc too. A 2007 interview with Spielberg and cast talking about the versions, an almost 2-hour documentary from Collector's Edition release, 42 minute "Making of" documentary.  After watching all the special features I want to go back and watch the film again.The Director's Cut seems to be the one to watch since it is Speilberg's idea of the how the movie should look.  Worth noting is the deirector's cut of the movie removes the scene inside the mother ship.  Wich Speilberg admits in the special features was a compromise with the studio to fund a few extra scenes for the Special Edition.  (The "Director's Cut" is a combination and re-cut of the original release and the special edition.)In colclusion, a fantastic release that seems to embrace the benefits that the Blu Ray format offers.  A stunning and breathtaking transfer of an already great movie.  The transfer is so good that you'll feel like you're watching it for the first time all over again.  I suspect this release will be in most Blu Ray owner's libraries.

$REVIEW.: Blake Edwards had a unique style of film; all the films seemed to have a certain atmosphere while each maintaining an individual character. Of course, Julie Andrews was a frequent actress in his films - Edwards and Andrews are married, and have been since 1969, an astonishing longevity for Hollywood.In 'Victor/Victoria', Edwards returns to a Parisian settings familiar to fans of his work in the Pink Panther series - there is some minor elements of slapstick (the clutzy waiter, the bumbling detective, perhaps a nod in the direction of the Pink Panther films), but the real narrative plot is drawn along by the stylish comedy of Julie Andrews (Victoria Grant/Victor) and Robert Preston (Carroll Todd), in one of his last films.The film is actually based on a much older piece, from 1933, written by Reinhold Sch&uuml;nzel, a German actor and writing, known in Europe primarily from the 1920s to the 1950s (perhaps English-speaking audiences would know him best from his role in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Notorius'). This was not the first, nor the last remake of this piece.Preston plays an aging, gay, musical theatre man-about-town, who we take it is various a performer, talent scout, and director. Through a strange set of circumstances, he happens to be in a restaurant with a down-on-her-luck singer, who has just flopped at her last audition, and was willing to sell her virtue to the hotel manager for a meatball. She has captured a cockroach, and intends to plant the bug in the salad, thus avoiding payment of the bill - Carroll Todd ('Toddy' to his friends) and Victoria escape the restaurant, and come to share a room together while figuring out what to do.Toddy comes up with the idea of dressing up Victoria as a man to then present her as the greatest drag queen, with the absurd name of Count Victor Grezhinski, a gay Polish count. 'Who would ever believe it?' Victoria protests. 'A woman pretending to be a man pretending to be woman.''It's perfect!' Toddy insists.'Everyone will know he's a phony,' Victoria insists.'Exactly! Everyone will know HE's a phony.'Victoria as Victor auditions for Andre Cassell (John Rhys-Davies), the greatest talent and booking agent in Paris. He schedules Victor to open in a grand venue, and the deception seems complete. That is, until King Marchand (James Garner), a Chicago gangster and nightclub owner, arrives, complete with bodyguard (Alex Karras) and moll in tow (Leslie Ann Warren). He doesn't believe the act, and is determined to discover the truth.While Victor/Victoria is not a musical in the sense of 'Cats' or 'Showboat', it does have some really stunning musical numbers, as one would expect from a Julie Andrews production. 'Le Hot Jazz' and 'The Shady Dame from Seville' are excellent numbers (Preston does his own reprise of 'The Shady Dame' for the big finale), and other numbers are fun; Leslie Ann Warren does her own over-the-top tribute to Chicago. The original music is done by Henry Mancini, and thus another Pink Panther connection.The costumes (done by Patricia Norris, a very experienced and wide-ranging costumer) are perfect, both for the stage production numbers (dramatic and with flair, as might befit a drag queen, then or now), and off the stage - the period setting of inter-war Paris, with the genteel poverty of some and the opulence of others side-by-side is very well done.This is the first film in which I recall major gay figures - it was a popular film in part because the primary actors were well know, and the issue of gay life was presented both in a distant and a non-controversial manner. If there are politics in it at all, it is that sex shouldn't be a political issue. King Marchand, a bit upset at being identified as someone who might date a man (Victor) has one scene in which he re-affirms his masculinity (by going to a seedy bar and picking a fight), only to discover that people aren't always what he thought they were.This could be a theme throughout the whole film - people are never what you think they are, and life never turns out as expected. The tone of the film is rather lighthearted throughout, and the situations play very well. Does King Marchand get the girl/guy? Does Carroll Toddy become the toast of Paris? Does Chicago get an airport?? See the film and find out.

$REVIEW.: By "fun" I mean "worth the price of a rental," but by stupid I mean, "make sure you've got some alchohol handy, or possibly a bunch of friends who are in to amateur MST3K."This is not to say that the movie is altogether without merit, because that's not the case.The cinematography is pretty good, the settings are grand, and the costume-director deserves a shrine. Even the acting improves once the girls warmed up and the danger-factor was cranked up. There are more than a couple of scenes that qualify as scary visual gold, and there's a lot of atmospheric detail if you're willing to look for it. All in all, this flick wasn't THAT badly made or badly written ... but that having been said, it still felt like it was missing something.I never did fully understand what the native prophecies had to do with anything, and I never came to terms with what the Mysterious Old Woman's Cryptic Message of Doom&trade; meant. I understand that the girls misunderstood her intent, but if the correct core of her message was "kill the dog-boy before he bites you," she may as well have given them some practical information instead, like -- "Your horse went that way." "Here's a freaky dead animal necklace, and for the love of all that's holy, stay away from crazy British men in swishy coats." "Buy low, sell high." Really anything at all would have been more helpful than spouting a goofy riddle about murdering your sister.I don't know. I found a surprising number of things to like about this movie, and I wouldn't mind picking up the first two now (I freely admit that this was my first foray into the franchise); but I'm going to keep my hopes in the low-to-mid range and wish for the best.

$REVIEW.: This is undoubtedly the best sci-fi on film-- ever!  It gives a glimpse into what we were, are, and may become.  The genius of this film was that it was able to objectify human behavior by clothing it in ape's fur.  The  character development and acting is first rank (perhaps with the exception  of Charelton Heston, who gives a very slightly contrived performance).  The  actors playing the apes deserve most of the praise, for obvious reasons,  but there's not much to complain about on the human side.  If this film  were a woman, I would make passionate love to her.

 One of the greatest, ironic, moving, and dramatic ideas in a story/movie that I can think of.THE MOVIE:  The movie wasn't as good as it could've been, it being an indepenent film with limited budgiting can do that


I found it blah at times.RYAN GOSLING:  Ok, this guy is now on the scene as the new hot star in hollywood

 He is young, thin, good looking and can say a line which is good enough to become a star these days in hollywood

 Hollywood needs an attractive male hero in every generation and it seems they are making Gosling just that for this one

 However, i'm not stupid and I don't fall for the hollywood hero that they create for the public
 I DON'T think Gosling is that great of an actor and I KNOW he is overrated


 The only role that I can give him SOME credit for is of course "The Believer" for which this review is for


 But, for the most part He just doesn't sound real to me, as if when he says something, it is fake

 Maybe it's his accent or the sound of his voice but whatever it is, I don't see this great actor that holloywood makes him out to be and what other people think he is - mostly girls who think he is "hot" and "love" him
 Lol, thinking an actor is hot and loving him is fine, but that doesn't make him a great actor
 They just think he is sweet, makes them horny and that's it, lol

And i'm not just pointing out Gosling here, I can name other actors that STINK but are famous or are getting famous because soley of their looks:  Brad Pitt, Viggo Morteson, Josh Hartnett come to mind
 I mean, just watch these people act, there is NOTHING great about these guys...just their faces and lean bodies, which has nothing to do with acting and making a character believable
 Give me an actor, good looking or not good lookng that can ACT, i'll praise him/her
 I will not praise pretty boys in hollywood because that is all they are, pretty boys

 Back to Gosling, he fits the mold of this category, he is better than josh hartnett but he still is in there unfortunetly.ACTORS THAT DESERVE THE TITLE "ACTOR":  Kathy Bates, Tom Hanks, Edward Norton, Orson Wells, Betty Davis,

$REVIEW.: Here are a few thoughts on three of the Civil War Shorts in this package."Swords and Hearts" is the last and the best of the seven Civil War shorts Griffith directed over this three-year period. This group nicely illustrates his tracking along a very steep learning curve as he becomes ever more technically and creatively proficient with the new art form of film-making. "Swords and Hearts" is billed as a wartime story in old Virginia and entertainingly alternates between domestic and battle sequences.The chapter captions pretty much tell the story: 1. Hugh Frazier (Wilfred Lucas) son of a wealthy tobacco planter 2. His neighbor-Irene Lambert (Claire McDowell) beautiful but calculating 3. Jennie Baker (Dorothy West) and her father (Francis J. Grandon) of the "poor white class" 4. Promise me you will be mine 5. To join his company in the confederate army 6. We shall marry when you return 7. Months later, unknown to Hugh, Jennie's chance to prove her love 8. To steal a visit with Irene 9. Old Ben (William J. Butler) anticipates the bushwhackers' attack 10. Defeated in war, rejected in love 11. Hugh realizes her loyalty and worth.The story incorporates Griffith's favorite themes, the superior virtues of the poor whites and the loyalty of the Negro slaves to their masters. It is quite ambitious as at times Griffith cross-cuts between three different events occurring simultaneously. Unfortunately the use of white actors in black-face in several scenes is disconcerting.Dorothy West was arguably the most contemporary looking and natural of all the silent film stars. Consequently her films from 1910-1917 have held up better even than stuff made years later at the end of the silent film era. West combines the seemingly contradictory qualities of adolescent femininity that fascinated Griffith; a virginal unworldliness and a plucky practicality. In the film's best action sequence Jennie demonstrates her practicality by taking Hugh's uniform and horse, then leading the Yankee cavalry away from her love (during his liaison with Irene). An accomplished rider, West does her own stunts and even shoots a Yankee from horseback."In the Border States" is another of  Griffith's Civil War shorts. Although filmed in the wilds of New Jersey (Delaware Water Gap), from the title the likely intended setting is western Maryland, West Virginia, or eastern Kentucky. A border state would have sent units to both armies but this short features the home of a departing union soldier.Shortly after he leaves with his regiment an unarmed Condederate arrives at the soldier's house and his youngest daughter (played by Gladys Egan-Mary Pickford has a smaller part as the older daughter) hides him from a Yankee patrol. He tries to kiss her in appreciation but the little girl is too patriotic to allow this. A few days later her wounded father stumbles home pursued by a Confederate patrol. The Confederate she saved is detailed to search the house and he returns the favor by not turning in her father. The little girl again refuses his kiss but they compromise and salute each other.This is a cute little home front story in the standard silent film style of acting, much more like stage acting than acting for the camera. Some of the scenes are captioned but it is largely unnecessary because you can follow the pantomime without any trouble. Griffith inserts a couple of then revolutionary edits (match cuts) into the film, as actors are going though a door and then coming into the room on the other side. Watch for one of the first continuity problems ever, as a solder with two chevrons on his sleeves goes into the house and in the cut to him from inside he is wearing a uniform with no chevrons.Griffith manages to incorporate some nice scenery into a couple exterior shots that are staged to take advantage of the scenic background."The Fugitive" is a surprisingly moving D.W. Griffith Civil War short with a focus on the home front. Two sons named John (one from a Union family and one from a Confederate family) go off to war leaving behind their mothers and fianc?es. Their respective foraging parties encounter each other and exchange fire, and the Union party runs into the woods near the home of the Confederate John. During the pursuit the two Johns fire on each other and Confederate John is killed. Union John (Edwin August) seeks shelter in a nearby house and persuades the mother (Kate Bruce) of the soldier he just killed to hide him. She continues to conceal him even after learning that he killed her son, basically to spare his mother the grief that she is experiencing.Griffith shorts frequently emphasized this "brother against brother" theme of the war, probably because he came from the border state of Kentucky which furnished units to both armies.Note that the confederate home has a portrait of George Washington on display. Also note the almost contemporary look and manner of Dorothy West (who plays the finance of the Confederate soldier), she looks and acts little different than a typical 2006 high school girl with acting aspirations.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

The 'two-parts' use of time satisfied for revealing the depth of events maturing the characters and relationships (teen marriage, at-risk pregnancy, reluctant (albeit immortal) teen father hangs in there, heroically through childbirth and death)..


loved the 'wink' visual storytelling allowed the writer, director, et.al to play as the fantastic battle scene

Jackie Chan's character was wise but humble, skilled but humorous, and connects with the viewer. If you like medieval Chinese historical fiction action movies, then I highly recommend this one.

$REVIEW.: Those are the immortal words of the mystical Jeweller in this film, played wonderfully by Burt Lancaster. Based on the international best-selling book by Pope John Paul II, this film has an excellent cast of Lancaster, Olivia Hussey and Ben Cross. It gives a realistic portrayal of the struggles and the triumphs in the marriages of three couples, showing that the the union of man & woman in marriage is that mysterious mix of freedom, love, sacrifice, and grace. It is a touching and lovely film, while still portraying the sorrows and challenges in married life. The Pope had some very positive things to say about this film. It does make one want to go read his book, which I have read, and it is a little jewel itself. This is the second to last film for the legendary Burt Lancaster.

$REVIEW.: I have enjoyed these DVD's very much and watch them over and over. They are inspirational and very much worth the money. They followed the scriptures to the letter. The one disappointment was that The Gospel of John did not show the scripture verse by verse. Even though it was not NIV I followed the version used in my Bible and it was the same except for a word her or there moved. Acts I was enjoying but It locked up on Chapter 22. It completely locked up the system and was hard to shut off. So I didn't get to watch the end of it. I did try again but it did the same thing in the same spot. I think there was a flaw in the DVD or the filmig itsself. The acting in all three was very good also.

$review_text.: Seen as one of the weakest Bond films ever made, A View To A Kill is not as bad as one might think


 Roger Moore is over the hill in this one, and the Bond girls are about as annoying as ever


 The action is toned down compared to some Bond films, but the lead villain and his interesting henchwoman make up for the loses, as well as an exciting climactic action scene that is must see.Christopher Walken steals the show in this one
 He plays the psychopathic villain named "Zorin", who is out to destroy the supply of microchips in Silicon Valley, California by creating the largest earthquake ever known

 He hopes that the destruction of the Valley will place the silicon market in his favor
 The man comes off as interesting in the beginning of the film, and ends up as a complete psycho - betraying nearly all his people and shooting them down in a rampage


 Christopher Walken delivers the lines with such originality and flavor, in a style that is, well - Christopher Walken

 You can't help but love this guy (as far as excellent villains go)

To add even more spice, he has a henchwoman named "May Day" who is easily the strangest villain ever seen in a Bond film


 Her choice for attire and hairstyles is quite unique to say the least, but she is an expert in martial arts and other skills as well, so to speak.The story and suspense were something to expect from a Bond film, but toned down overall, and slow at times
 Zorin, being an ex-KGB, keeps Russia involved in the mix - something that has been a consistent for the Roger Moore films
 I was hoping for more action than there was, and the film could use it
 Most of the scenes weren't too exciting, but a few did stand out
 Specifically, the exciting climax of Bond hanging onto Zorin's air blimp while it goes straight into the Golden Gate bridge, followed by an exciting fight at the top

 There is also a chase scene where Bond and Stacey (the annoying Bond girl) steal a firetruck and are follwed by cops


 It would have been more powerful if the villains were involved in the chase, but the lack of made the action scene a bit unnecessary.Locations are also more toned down too


 The film begins in Paris, and there is actually some action on the Eifel Tower

 Then the action shifts to Zorin's massive estate (and if you love horses, this is a treat.)  The last half of the movie takes place in California, mostly in San Francisco and an underground mine in the valley.It was probably time for Moore to retire before this film, for his age kept a lot of spice from his performance - and kept other elements of this movie stale as well

 But overall, this will still please to the die hard fan


 The villain is worth the price, as is the final scene on the Golen Gate bridge.Acting - 3.5Action - 3.5Characters - 4Story - 3.5Overall - 3.5

$review_text.: This movie had a Dr. Suess feel. It had that rhythmic rhyme, and the main character is born from an oddly animated machine, not spooky, just very Suess. The main character, Snoodle Doo, feels like he isn't very good at anything. All the other Snoodles add to his poor self-image, by drawing negative pictures of him and sticking them in his back pack.He finally comes across a cave where he meets his Creator. It is such a warm and golden moment, filled with love and hope, it warms the soul. At first he doesn't realize who he's met, and just explains how inadequate he is. Then his Creator draws him a picture showing him how He sees him. He looks like a Super Snoodle, very grand and flying through the air. Snoodle Doo has difficulty believing it until his Creator explains that He can see all Snoodle Doo is capable of, because He created him. Snoodle Doo leaves with renewed faith and hope in himself, and the rest of his world.I was moved by this movie. While I find it difficult to watch the build-up, where the other Snoodles are being so mean, the ending is worth it.

$review_text.: This movie was great!  This family was living the American Dream but it was built upon the sand.  The film portrayed so accurately the state of this country and the excesses by which we think we need to live.  All we need to do is look around our neighborhoods and we see foreclosed homes because people were trying to live out the dream and the truth is, the &#34;dream&#34; is not tangible goods, it's allowing Jesus to lead the way and teach you what is important.  The attitude of entitlement of each one is way too real.  But it was also very real in watching the transformation in each one as they began to see what life was truly about.  They became a real family and showed hope to those who may have fallen into the same financial trap.  It's real, it's family oriented, it's Christ centered and it is great entertainment that won't let you walk away without taking an inventory of yourself.

$review_text.: This movie was a riot!  I mean, it's pure crap, but you all know that.  Just look at the Rapid Heart label.  It should tell you two expect three things.  1) Predictible and yet Servicable Plot 2) Not So Great Special Effects and 3) Lots of Young Guys in Their Undies/Speedios/anything tight fitting.  So if those three don't scare you away, than get this movie.  I never stopped laughing the entire time.  It's just so bad its good.  It has a decent soundtrack, decenct cast (talent wise) and amazing cast (looks wise).  Plus the leaches look pretty cool for being nothing more than hand puppets.  Pick it up!

$review_text.: I just watched this last night and although I haven't seen every bit of it, from what I've seen so far, it's hot.  All the divas are posing in lingerie and it's basically just like the other WWE divas dvds.  The girls talk about how they are(some of them do kind of act in character from tv, Melina talks about her "paparazzi," Candice talks about being too hot for tv, etc)  and while they're doing that, they show clips from tv and sexy poses from the girls.  The girls also talk about some of the stuff they wear and then they show them wearing it and it's really hot.  If your a WWE diva fan, all the girls are hot looking, but most noticeably you should check out Mickie James, Melina, Candice, Torrie, and Trish.  The extras are decent too, one of them is the Stacy vs Christy lingerie pillow fight from Smackdown, another nice extra is this one where Lita talks trash to Matt Hardy and she unzips her jacket and reveals this shirt that you can pretty much see most of her boobs.  They also have some behind the scenes stuff from Stacy Keibler in Stuff Magazine, as well as behind the scenes photoshoots for when the divas appeared for Raw & Smackdown magazines.  They also highlight the 2005 diva search, if anyone's interested.Overall, I think this is the second or third best WWE divas dvd.  The best ever was WWE Divas Undressed and this is tied with WWE Divas South Of The Border.  This dvd is much better than last year's shoot and I highly recommend getting it.

$review_text.: A slow-paced but gripping thriller about what people will do to protect their family.  Set in New York's Hell's Kitchen in the 1980's the film has a gritty feel which suits the story of the two Irish-American brothers, played by Elijah Wood and Edward Burns, perfectly.  The movie begins on Ash Wednesday when Wood's character hears three members of an Italian crew saying they're going to kill his brother over his gambling debts.  He kills them before they have a chance than disappears from town, presumed dead.Three years later, also on Ash Wednesday, Wood's character is spotted in town which sets the dominos falling.  The rival gang leader wants his pound of flesh and Burns is in the crossfire.  In the meantime, Burn's character has fallen in love with his brother's wife, who thinks her husband is dead.Overall, I found the movie to be very enjoyable.  A good story and some good acting really brought the characters and the time and place alive.  I'd recommend it.

$review_text.: &quot;Thirteen Days&quot; re-created the Cuban Missile Crisis, elevating the Kennedys to virtual sainthood while painting Curt LeMay as an advocate for nuclear holocaust. It was a fantastic picture, like many of them, but in it is an interesting scene in which Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, tells a Navy plot to lie to LeMay about being shot at, because LeMay would supposedly have ordered a strike if he had been. The film paints this lie as the right thing to do because it advocates the Kennedy's position, which was to maintain level heads and a calm demeanor. However, in 1987 Ollie North was excoriated by the Left for lying about the funding of anti-Communist guerrillas, which was Reagan's position.

$review_text.: I was disappointed in the DVD

 I was hoping to get a film or video of the Cirque du Soleil show with all the music from show intact and the stage numbers that went with them
 NOOoooo


 You get mostly talk and talk (interesting the first time through but not for repeat listenings!) of the inception and preparation of the show and soundtrack

 It was like buying a DVD of a feature film that you had seen in the movie theatre or wanted to see and then getting the Special Features section of the DVD instead with mostly talk about the show and not the show itself

 Very few of the music numbers are even complete, most just are snipits and sound great but I felt like I was watching the Special Features from my other DVD's and was hoping for the whole show and the whole music from the show
 I was very unhappy with what I got, although as stated above worth watching ONCE

 Makes me wonder if the CD version I saw has snippits also or the entire music numbers


 Looks like it has 26 tracks but maybe they are only portions of 26 songs.

 Did Lucas say &quot;forget plot, lets just focus on special effects,&quot; or did he dumb it down because he thought nobody would understand

He may have been mentally disturbed before that, but we aren't shown enough of his background to make that determination.We are shown something of Quell's attempts to hold down a regular job -- he seems to have a gift for photography -- but he's quick to anger and attacks one of his customers without apparent provocation


He's also an alcoholic, and we see him drinking all manner of questionable substances, some of which appear to be potentially lethal
When he's accused of poisoning someone with one of his concoctions, he seeks refuge on a ship.This is where the film gives the audience a glimmer of hope that it will develop into something interesting
This ship is run by Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), who claims to be a writer, doctor, nuclear physicist, theoretical philosopher, and a great many more things
Dodd is fascinated by human beings and psychology, and wants to understand Quell and help him with his obvious anger issues


Dodd has his own way of doing things and his psychoanalysis produces the most memorable scenes in the movie.Dodd is married to Peggy (Adams), but she's just as unpleasant as the rest of the characters


She barely had any lines, and most of the ones she did have were obscene.Quell frequently fantasizes about women, as outlined in an early masturbation scene on the beach with a girl fashioned out of sand

This theme is continued when he pictures women naked at a gathering.If this were a story about Dodd's quest to heal Quell, I might be satisfied with it, but the plot meanders along without any obvious conclusion.I consider myself a patient viewer, and I appreciate all manner of films that have slow plots, hidden messages, and flawed characters
Unfortunately, The Master left me disappointed.The final 30 minutes were thought-provoking


I found myself thinking whether I should walk out, and whether anyone would mind if I were to take off my right shoe and scratch my foot

I also wondered whether time was moving differently all of a sudden, and if this was the same Paul Thomas Anderson who gave is There Will Be Blood and Magnolia.The individual components of the film were mostly in place; the acting was fine, the cinematography and score worked, and Anderson presented a convincing picture of New York in the 1950s

What wasn't present was a coherent story or a reason to care about these miserable characters.I doubt that Amy Adams will ever work for Disney again after some of the words that came out of her mouth.

This documentary presents the concept of sound in a way those of us who can hear don't usually think about
Evelyn Glennie is a percussionist who is deaf - something you don't normally see

This video captures her work, her philosophy, her style in an easy to follow format

While deaf, Ms
Glennie can speak quite articulately, and one has no difficulty following what she is saying
Her love of her work is quite evident, and will, oddly enough, open your eyes to what our ears so often miss.Children of a Lesser God

$review_text.: This movie is both too brief and too long, wildly exciting in places and boring in others, well acted in spots and cheesy elsewhere, the kind of movie that everyone says is good, so it must be good.Is it good? Yes it is
Good, but not great.Many others have already summed up the plot of this film so I won't waste your time here, but if you're anything like me -- a person who didn't have a definite idea of what this film was about but is a fan of both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis -- then this film should admirably fill a couple of hours of your day.You could do a lot worse!Anyway the movie seems a tad melodramatic, almost like it's taking itself too seriously as if it's a high art house film or something like that, and the aftertaste of this pretentiousness works against the film in my opinion, as a casual viewer.If you're into ballet and the world of dance troupe politics then there's a lot of insider stuff to be enjoyed, and even if you're not an expert on this art form the film does a good job of drawing you in.But the slowness of some parts rather than highlighting the exciting ones just gives the movie a "could have been better" flavor.Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis are SO beautiful though

I'm Jealous, definitely.

$review_text.: In this series by the creators of Babylon 5 (which I liked much less than Jeremiah), Luke Perry plays Jeremiah, a kind of lost, disaffected mid-20s guy who 15 years earlier lived through what's come to be known as the Big Death - a bioweapon hormone-based virus that 15 years earlier wiped out everyone who was past puberty. So it was that civilization was totally engulfed in post-apocalyptic chaos, since the only people who were left living were the children.Things haven't changed much in 15 years. In fact, with supplies from "Before" rapidly waning, things may actually be getting worse. There's no electricity or running water or long-distance communication any more, batteries and gasoline are worth their weight in gold, food is hard to come by, and society is basically total anarchy. They're living off the scraps of the world "before."In the midst of all of this, Jeremiah's on a quest to find the place that his parents told him they were heading to for safety before they disappeared 15 years earlier. He assumes they're dead like all the other adults, but still wants to know "how their story ends."In the pilot he meets Kurdy, who is played to pitch perfection by Malcolm Jamal Warner as this slightly younger, very lonely guy and they sort of form a team, realizing there's strength in numbers. He's looking for something too - he just isn't sure what that might be yet.The series is about the really gritty, harsh world they live in, the political battles between the various factions that want to take over, and the hope of a better tomorrow. The story telling is very intimate.  The scripts are often punctuated by quiet, revealing moments for the characters, and the show makes no bones about how much the inhabitants of this world constantly suffer, so it's really harrowing at times, but the characterization and acting and plot are extremely gripping.I originally caught this when it aired on Showtime and bought the season on DVD, and I wasn't sorry.  The world of the show is very realistic, and the dialogue is fascinating, because none of these characters went to school much, and they all talk and act like you'd expect people whose world ground to a traumatic halt as children to act. They're bratty, selfish, manipulative, never stupid (survival skills born of necessity and all that) sometimes painfully naive, and always hopeful that things will return to the way they were "before."The DVD has hours of extras that show exactly how much thought has gone into building the mythos of this show.  Showtime is just now going to start airing the second half of S2 in September 2004 (the last new episode aired November 2003) and no one is sure about a third season. But this is modern sci fi at its best and most gripping, and while the price is a bit steep at nearly $80, it's well worth it for the quality.  Who would have thought that a show starring Dylan from "90210" and Cliff Huxtable's only son could be this good? =)

Great story also.Content is low on anything sexual or profane, but it has a good amount of the typical violence found in a superhero movie --- along the same lines as any action-packed film that has digitally-created creatures of all kinds and superhumans fighting them and each other.

$REVIEW.: We are in the Golden Age of television, with great shows of all kinds--Horror, Political intrigue, Action, Romance, and yes, Comedy.  The extended story arcs of shows now allow all kinds of developments of character that were impossible in the old episodic formats that network shows followed so rigidly in the past.  And so, ironically, with Episodes.  The first season moves like a particularly funny Greek tragedy right into the final show; the second does likewise although a little less effectively.  The writing, by  David Crane and Jeffrey Klarik, is superb--a fantastic mix of hilarity and pathos, really smart humor and crudeness, all with powerful plot lines and terrific characterizations.  Although Matt LaBlanc gets top billing, the show is really about Stephen Mangan as Sean Lincoln and Tamsin Greig as his wife Beverly, and these two actors have superb comic timing.  Tamsin is the queen of the aside delivered after a beat, and Sean can deliver even a single word with brilliant comedic inflection--as, in the second season he enunciates the word 'date' like it's physically painful to say.  LeBlanc, far from my favorite character in Friends, proves he can act--he's not just the friendly but clueless Joey here--although he is indeed that--but also at times caring, pathetic, remorseful, sarcastic and more...especially horny.  Although 'subtly nuanced' might be inappropriate, it's a much richer, more complex and realistic character than Joey.  The ensemble is full of brilliant supporting actors, too.  Many have written of John Pankow's brilliant turn as Merc Lapidus, the viciously evil TV producer, but my favorite is Kathleen Rose Perkins as Carol Rance, his executive assistant, who makes every line drip with heartfelt insincerity.  And I have to mention Joseph May as Andy Button, whose silent departure after being fired is one of the great moments of physical comedy.  Episodes is brilliant through and through, and although the second season isn't quite as strong as the first, it is definitely worth your time.  Most highly recommended.
$SUMMARY.: Brilliant writing and acting!

$review_text.: NOTHING LIKE THE HOLIDAYSWhen watching this movie I noticed something crazy going on and it hit home with me a little, well more so than that. This movie more or less is actually happing to me right now, so that may affect how much I like or dislike this film. This may be a spoiler so you may want to turn away now if you don't want to know. But as of now during Christmas my family has come together up at my mom's in Maryland. Nextly and to add to the time period comparison is that this film about a Latin family is true with me as well since my brother, sister, and girl all are at least half Latin of some kind. And lastly much like the father in this film my mother has cancer; she will beat it no doubt as she has before [twice]. So I can relate with this film in many ways and thusly appreciate it a lot more.The Rodriguez family is finally all going to be home together as all members from direct to family friends will all be coming back to Chicago. Of course some are still there like the parents and family friends, cousins and such. But one son and wife are coming away from their big jobs, the daughter is coming home from Hollywood, and another son is coming back from serving time in the military over in the war. Of course the parents could not be happier and the family business is going good but a lot of tension and jealousy is bubbling underneath the surface. For the parents the husband is getting mysterious phone calls that are putting a strain on the relationship, potentially leading to a divorce. The married son is having marital problems of his own since his career driven wife does not want kids like he does, and the famous movie star daughter is not as famous as she says. In fact she is still waiting on a call from her agent that could lead to her biggest role yet. And then there is the war hero son that is not so proud of what happened over seas that lead to his return home and the pressure put on him by his father to take over the family business is crushing him. Add in a bitter ex girlfriend who has moved on with someone else and you have the makings of the typical family Christmas.We open with nothing more than good times as war hero son Jesse Rodriguez [Freddy Rodriguez] is being picked up by best friend Johnny [Luis Gusman] and Ozzy [Jay Hernandez]. Good times are had after as all of the family makes their way to the parent's house [Alfred Molina & Elizabeth Pena], son Mauricio [John Leguizamo] and his wife Sarah [Debra Messing] arrive as well. Their acting sister Roxanna [Vanessa Ferlito] shows as well of course and the family is all together once more for the first time in forever apparently. Still the good times role even after Jesse's ex and her new man show up, as the family gathers for a huge meal the fun kicks in. It is at this point that all is revealed and the family starts to fight like only a family can. We all know how that works out since your family can throw all kinds of personal hurtful stuff out there.Of course the film not only deals with the family's problems but with the friends as well and Johnny wants to kill the man that killed his brother and is now free on the streets. That is explored as far as it could be and results in a good moment. Of course as mentioned before the father has cancer and is battling that through the holidays. This is the par that hits home with me the most as it is happening right now with my mama, I love my mama. This story arc got especially emotional for not only me, my brother, and sister but mostly for my grandparents [her parents]. My grandmother in particular has she cannot stand what is happing to her baby. But much like the father in this my mother is strong and will beat this without a doubt. She will be the three time defending champ against cancer after battling and beating brain cancer since that tumor was supposed to kill her. Then there was a separate non related cancer in her uterus, and now another different non related cancer that attacked many different parts of her.Aside from my personal stuff going on there is also wonderful performances and such from all. Alfred Molina is brilliant as the father in this film giving a wonderful performance, his battle with cancer hits home. His wife played by Elizabeth Pena is very strong and should be noted that she steals scenes easily. Freddy Rodriguez is great as the son who returns home after being injured in the war, he also is scared in more ways than one. Luis Gusman and  Jay Hernandez are great as well as the two friends that are there to pick him up, one is really funny and the other is a little more deep. Vanessa Ferlito is wonderful as always as the sister aspiring for an acting career.  John Leguizamo and Debra Messing are absolutely perfect as a married couple who are having problems in deciding if they want a baby, add in Debra is white in an all Latin family and you have real fun then. Alexander Bautista, Melonie Diaz, Ramses Jimenez, and Manny Sosa all turn in great performances as well. Turns out to be very wonderfully acted, of course it is all in how much you relate.To be honest I may have enjoyed this more so than the average viewer but I would still recommend this film. Check it out as a rental at least because it is a good movie regardless. Director Alfredo De Villa and writers Alison Swan, Rick Najera, Robert Teitel, and Rene M. Rigal all did a good job with this film. The film is funny at times and a little more dramatic at others, there is something for everybody in this. Does this film have problems, to be honest it probably does but I liked it. Maybe the situation affected my judgment but isn't that the point of a review.

$review_text.: Every few years since the early 1970s it seems we get a year when the "rebirth of the western" is touted, because of one or two films that are seen as somehow predictive of a return to glory - either through good box-office, awards, or both. Somehow it's never quite really happened, despite "Dances With Wolves" and "Unforgiven" both being huge box-office hits and Best Picture winners in the early 90s, and neo-western "No Country for Old Men" repeating in 2007. Ah well, the western will probably never get back to where it was in the early 1970s, let alone the 1950s, but the pundits have to keep trying...One of the first times I remember such comments being made was in 1985, the year of Lawrence Kasdan's 'New Hollywood' western "Silverado", and Clint Eastwood's third essay in the genre as director (and first in 9 years), "Pale Rider". I remember the Kasdan pic having a slightly higher profile at the time, and it's the one I saw first - I never caught the Eastwood in the theater nor for years afterward, and I just got around to giving it a rewatch this past week. "Silverado" seems to have something of a cult following, and I always just assumed it was a bigger hit, but it turns out that the film grossed about $10 million less than "Pale Rider" and cost about $20 million more - it may not have been a flop, but it was an expensive effort at a genre that most thought dead, and I'd imagine Eastwood's film must have been seen as an exception because of it's star/director.A small mining community, somewhere in the west in the late 1800s. Terrorized by a wealthy landowner who wants them to leave so that he can steal their land, Hull Barrett (Michael Moriarty), his wife-to-be (of sorts) Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgrass) and her teenage daughter Megan (Sydney Penny) are among those who are praying for a miracle, which comes in the shape of Preacher (Eastwood) who rides into the nearby town just as Barrett is about to get beaten to death by four of landowner Coy LaHood's (Richard Dysart) thugs. "Nothing like a good piece of hickory" he exclaims after beating the tar out of the four with an axhandle. From then it's just a quick couple of scenes before both Wheeler women are falling in love with him and he's urging the miners to stick up for themselves. It becomes pretty clear that he's no ordinary man of God, if he's one at all and that any lessons in self-reliance he can teach these people will run secondary to Clint Eastwood badassery with a pistol, which comes at the end after LaHood has hired guns led by Stockburn (awesomely cold-eyed John Russell) in cool cream-colored dusters take on Preacher in a classic showdown. "Shane", anyone?"Pale Rider", like most of Eastwood's films, improved somewhat for me on this second time around - but not all that much. A couple of basic problems are present from the outset - first, that Eastwood is essentially replaying not just "Shane", but both his character and the storyline of "High Plains Drifter" as well - with most of the metaphysical and allegorical/symbolic material removed or heavily muted (despite his character being called, and dressing as, a Preacher), so it has a rather generic "man with no name rides into community to save the little people from the bad greedy corporate villains" storyline without nearly as much stylistic strangeness to make it interest. He even has a back scarred with bullet holes - in the same pattern which he'll shoot into one of the bad guys at the end. And second, there are a fair number of just badly or sketchily put-together scenes, a problem I think more with the screenplay (an original by Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack) than Clint's direction - the Preacher's relationship with Carrie Snodgrass' character who apparently falls in love with him right away though it's pretty hard to tell, and the scene where Preacher and Barrett ride into the main LaHood mining camp and lay waste to it with dynamite, completely unopposed. And beyond the similar aspect to his own earlier film there are also a lot of parallels with ShaneBut on the plus side, it moves along nicely - at less than two hours it's relatively short for Eastwood - the acting is all pretty solid, with Moriarty a standout, given a nice little speech by the fire exhorting his fellow miners to stand up to LaHood - and the technical aspects are all first-rate, especially considering the under-$7 million budget (can that really be correct? seems cheap even by Clint's modest standards). I love the typical contrast in the photography between piercingly bright winter skies and the very dim, naturally-lit intereriors and there really is a sense of hardness to the life depicted here in this rugged mountainous terrain. Lennie Niehaus' music is fine, if not one of his best scores, though it has a couple of nice "Josey Wales" references at one point. And there's a spareness and simplicity to the dialogue (except for some of Moriarty's longer parts) that fits the somewhat minimal and stripped-to-essentials feel of the film as a whole.Still few of the westerns made in the next several years seem to have taken much from Eastwood's classical style or tight, cheap and lean filmmaking - and none of them were even remotely as successful. Not only can you not teach an old dog new tricks, you can't teach a new dog old ones, it seems.
$SUMMARY.: Derivative and fairly simple, but nonetheless great fun as usual from a master

$REVIEW.: I was going to rate this a "4" because the yoga instructor (Adrienne Reed) doesn't have that "mystical-spiritual-yoga guru thing" going on -- she's more like a peppy work out instructor.  However, this dvd is such a dang good workout that I had to give it 5 stars.  What I really like is that there are 3 separate workouts -- 20, 40 and 60 minute workouts -- and each one is a different workout.  Also, there is a lot of upper body and ab work involved (attention women with wimpy upper bodies!  This one will fix that).  The svasanas (relaxation phase) are good, too (I guess that would be the "spiritual" part) and they are separate/in addition to the workout, so a given workout is not 40 minutes INCLUDING the svasana, it's 40 PLUS a 5 or 7 minute svasana (or 20 minutes or 60 minutes).If you are looking for good "workout" yoga, I recommend this dvd.

$review_text.: This is much better than the cheeseball packaging would suggest.  As other reviewers have noted, it IS all archival footage, but it's stuff I've never seen before, a lot of it is in color, and it comes from high quality prints.  Admittedly, the narration and the image don't always match up very well, but there just isn't that much footage of Nazi occultism.I'm no expert, but I disagree that the content is "not just wrong, but inaccurate."  I thought the content was basically the same as in Goodricke-Clark's book.  And this movie predates that authoritative work by 5 years, so the filmmakers were doing pretty well.Predictably, the narrator is English and he does use the word "madman" a lot.  Hey, there are admittedly a lot of madmen in this story, but the people who make these WWII docs could still benefit from a thesaurus.If there's problem with this series, it is that there just isn't enough information.  It isn't until six minutes into the first episode that "the occult" is even referenced, and the third episode -on Himmler- doesn't mention his name for the first twelve minutes.But this set still exceeded my expectations on all fronts and  -at 209 minutes- it was well worth ten bucks.

The acting is distinct, the plot clear and you don't always feel like the characters are constantly running through the Canadian forests.  I would actually recommend that the entire family watch this one together one Saturday afternoon with a large bowl of popcorn.  There is enough fact-based meat to perhaps engage young children to ask about the mysterious wonders already here on earth.

$review_text.: This is a very stylish story of a young Irish girl's affair with an older man. Part sad, part whimsical, and all around very refreshing, the film winds up being more light and fun than dark and tragic, as one might expect.The film is wonderfully photographed in glorious black and white, both in a documentary format and a dash of a somewhat "New Wave" style. It's an interesting mixture, anyway. In fact, the entire film appears to have been shot on location in Dublin and the surrounding countryside, lending even further creditbility to the documentray styling.The well-written dialogue is full of engaging double-meanings, and may remind one of "The Prisoner", as the lines can be both cryptic, yet very deep and telling. The actors all deliver, too.The film is very much a product of its time, and captures the feeling of what it must have been like to be a youth in 1963 Dublin. It very much conveys the atmosphere of a "slice of life" during the era, as the young girl comes of age.This is a little-known gem that aspiring film students may find inspirational. Lynn Redgrave's debut film.

$REVIEW.: Best:1) Bruce Willis was very cool as the aloof assassin, as was Richard Gere in the non-standard role the Irish ex-IRA soldier tracking him.2) Many scenes were suspensful and exciting - especially the ending. There's also a twist about who the assassin is really targeting.3) The specially-built hardware the &quot;Jackal&quot; used was extremely radical and watching him practice was quite a sight.4) There's a director commentary track, interviews and a behind-the-scenes feature.Worst:1) It falls short of being a worthy remake of &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (but it delivers on simply being a good movie that uses the same premise).Recommendation:If you like movies that are mostly suspense, then you'll probably like this cat-and-mouse thriller. The action scenes, although brief, are pretty intense. Get this one and enjoy seeing the ever-joking Jack Black getting his just deserts - over and over again (ha).

$REVIEW.: Kate Beckensale might be best remembered for her role in PEARL HARBOR, but I first became aware of her in EMMA.  I am very happy to see that CCF has finally been 'uncoupled' from the porm film one used to find for sale with it. I have been replacing my lazer disks one by one as films become available on DVD and had waited for a long while for this DVD.The film is a gem.  Joanna Lumley makes a rather brief appearance although she is pictured on the DVD cover.  I suppose Universal Studios thought we Americans might recognize Lumley before Eileen Atkins, who also plays in this film although she was recently seen in COLD MOUNTAIN as the 'old goat woman' or Ian McKellen who played Gandalf in the Ring triogy, or Stephen Fry who played Jeeves in the JEEVES AND WOSTER series.CCF is funny and sentimental in a British sort of manner. Who else but the British could envision the salvation of one of their own farm oafs as an offer from Hollywood to play in what undoubtedly will be romantic film productions. (Hey, we aren't all boobs who shoot from the lip!!). And, Joanna Lumley is superb as a slightly weird single girl who spends her down time fondling mannequins.In spite of the tongue and cheek sexual innuendo, I think this film is suitable for family watching.  The sly sexy humor is probably over the heads of most American kids. But what do I know, I don't watch American tv, I watch BBC America.

$REVIEW.: I was really impressed by the update concerning Religion and Religious participation.  The Curate in the book had weak faith and was a coward.  The majority of characters in the book had strong faith, was brave in the presence of the Martians, and gathered in various churches and prayed for a miracle while under attack.  The Martians dying in the city near the churches with the presence of religion against an enemy that we could not defeat with our technology and weapons reinforced the fact of the novel that they were defeated by God in his wisdom.

Although the second series is a continuance of the story, there is a few disjointed parts to the story such as the girl returning from France after two years of study there [we didnt know from series one that Selfridge sent her] and some of the actors changed. It is still a compelling story to watch.

$review_text.: KUNG FU HUSTLE is clearly one of the silliest, funny, genuinely well-produced comedies to come around for a long time.  It is so very refreshing to lose yourself in this farce knowing that the entire purpose of the film is to entertain.  But as in all good comedy there is also a message.Talented director/writer (with Tsang Kan Cheong)/star Stephen Chow has the whole concept of Kung Fu as entertainment down pat.  With the brilliant choreography of Yuen Wo Ping as partner, Chow tells a skeletal tale of two wannabe criminals (Chow himself and his obese sidekick Chi Chung Lam) who will stop at nothing to become members of the Canton mafia Axe Gang. They blunder into a hick town run by a smarmy landlord and his bellicose wife  to find someone to kill, as that is the only way they can join the Axe Gang. But this sleepy little town is unafraid of gangs, why? - because they happen to be the home of some expert Kung Fu practitioners.  After some absurd events the Axe Gang happens into the town only to come up against impossible odds and a lot of hilarious surprises.The choreography and setting parodies everything in the Hollywood repertoire: the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, High Noon antics, Busby Berkeley type staging, Keystone Cops zany shenanigans, Marital Arts films - name it, the film takes a shot and the shot outdoes the original!  The color and cinematography are terrific, the musical score (to which Chow also contributed!) is a little masterwork of ancient Chinese instruments garnished with contemporary sounds, and the actors, when not engaged in the nonstop fighting sequences, just seem to be having the best time being silly.  For pure diversion and giggling entertainment, spend an evening in the  company of Stephen Chow and crew.  Recommended, even for serious movie aficionados!  Grady Harp, January 06

$review_text.: Although Universal has released a beautiful print of Shanghai Express (1932) on DVD in Europe and Australia in Region 2 and 5 in PAL format, they have never released a Region 1 DVD in the U.S. Why not??? (Fortunately, I have an all-region player so this wasn't a problem for me.) This is an exquisite film. Marlene has never been more beautiful as a woman of dubious reputation who will go to any extreme to protect the man she loves, even if the little reputation she has takes a direct hit as a result. Though melodramatic in a fun way, the direction by Von Sternberg is magnificent in this tale of the Chinese Civil War and an-ill fated train trip to Shanghai.  Rich with texture and contrast, the film features Marlene Dietrich at her most sultry (and beautifully dressed and coiffed), ably assisted by Anna May Wong at HER must sultry. Two Hollywood bombshells for the price of one! How great is that? What's more, out of the many thousands of movies I've watched over the years, this one has my all-time favorite movie quote -- from Marlene: "It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily."

what keeps this story "bubbley" is that the film features stars with such prescence...


they all seem so light-heartedly immersed in the project that their acting is fun to watch  - almost like an snl skit, at times, at its contagiously mirthful best
i dare anyone not to laugh during the scene in  which the "monster" comes out of the ceiling as gene wilder is trying to sleep

i have seen this movie three times, and i have laughed and laughed at that scene, every time

gene wilder simply knows how to strike the proverbial universal chord.

$REVIEW.: This is a great tape. It was the first bellydance-oriented tape I bought, and it was after I hadn't worked out in any capacity for a good three months. I popped this tape in one night, found it very managable and pleasurable and was left feeling exhilirated - so much, in fact, I rewound it and did the moves again. After that I was hooked. The moves in this tape are not strenuous - stretching, some very mild aerobics, and so on, with a bit of bellydance tossed into the mix - snake arms, hip circles, Egyptian folk dance moves, head slides and so on. It is an excellent foundation tape, good for limbering up, and the twins demonstrate everything clearlyp; plus the camera shows the full body or zooms on on legs, etc. to give you a clearer example of the moves. Some people could do this tape without breaking a sweat, myself included, but it feels great to wake up the muscles with this tape. Excellent for the beginner, a warm-up or a quick 30-minute pick-me-up.

$REVIEW.: "The Magnificent Yankee" is an acting tour-de-force by Louis Calhern, whose long, distinguished career began in 1921 as a matinee idol and culminated in his masterful character roles in the years before his untimely death in 1956. A Shakespearean actor whose work on the legitimate stage was lauded by fans and critics alike, Calhern portrays the estimable Holmes with a measured balance of wit, sensitivity, and intellectuality. Calhern's silky voice, debonair demeanor, and commanding presence are legendary, and were used to particlularly grand effect in this great film. Highly recommended---I hope it will be transferred to DVD. It's a shame so many young people nowadays have no clue about such master thespians as Louis Calhern. Since his films were devoid of blatant sex and vulgarity, and their plots required actual thought, I fear "The Magnificent Yankee" may never be transferred to DVD. There is probably not enough interest among the "deep" and "sophisticated" movie fans of contemporary popular "culture." However, for those of you who still appreciate great films and truly talented actors, purchase this classic film. You'll be glad you did.

$REVIEW.: When my granddaughter heard that MONSTERS VS ALIENS was opening here in Australia on her eighth birthday, she wanted to go. So after a morning at the mall and a festive lunch, off we went to collect our 3D glasses and settle in for the big show.DreamWorks Animation dishes up a terrific family movie with MONSTERS VS ALIENS. The story is a bit thin but who cares? the characters rock. Susan Murphy gets hit by a meteorite just before her wedding in Modesto, California, and she grows to an incredible 49 feet, 11 inches in height. The U.S. Army "captures" her and incarcerates her in a secret monster facility underground, where she meets her fellow monsters: a smart mutant half-cockroach helpfully named Dr. Cockroach, a blob of blue protoplasm named B.O.B., the fishy Link, and the giant Insectosaurus.Susan (who has been given the code name Ginormica) and the rest of the monster crew are released and commissioned to defend earth against a gigantic evil robot--and after an epic battle, they are victorious. Too bad about the Golden Gate Bridge but it can be built again better than new, surely? Susan tries to settle back in to her old life but at just under 50 feet tall, it really doesn't work out for her. Her sleazy fiance dumps her to focus on his career in broadcasting, and Susan realizes that she has true friends among the monsters and takes pleasure in her power. When the alien threat to Earth reappears ("I come in peace. Most of you will be killed ... but I come in peace") Susan and the crew save Earth.The 3D graphics are superb; this is a movie that entertained all of us from the five-year-old on up.  The voice casting generally worked well, especially Reese Witherspoon as Susan and Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach. I was dubious about Susan when I first saw her Barbie-like looks and shape, but this is a girl who gets by on her brains and power, so there was no damage control necessary with my granddaughters. (Who knew that getting hit with a meteorite on your wedding day and growing to 50 feet tall could turn out to be good luck?) As for violence, you can't expect monsters and aliens to clash without somebody getting hurt, but mostly there was a lot of spectacular roaring and blowing up and nothing to speak of in the way of gore.I can see that I've been missing out on a fine treat by skipping these DreamWorks productions. Count me in! Kid or no kid, if this bunch of lovable monsters goes on the road with a sequel, save me a seat.Linda Bulger, 2009

The verbal slugfest with Adam Baldwin&#8217;s Animal.The music that accompanies is a survey of sixties and seventies rock. Joker&#8217;s Buddy Cowboy may be from Texas but he lacks both the height and physical presence to assume command and when it falls to him he lacks the respect of his men who disobey his orders and waste copious amounts of ammo out of frustration with no enemy in sight and eventually get him killed. The singing of the Mickey Mouse Theme at the end seems only appropriate. Both a comment on the war and an expression of joy at still being alive having beaten the odds.

$REVIEW.: KUNG FU PANDA 2 (2011, 91 mins. SPOILER ALERT....) was quite the exhilarating experience ... but not the experience the original 2008 film was. Though this film was spectacular CGI (I expected nothing less) and terrific performances, it is lacking in the good subtle nuances of the first film. The one-liner humor, as brilliant as it is, is simply too thin. All right, so enough of the kung fu practice on the poor thing. Here is what is best about this:Po (Jack Black) and the gang (The Furious Five whom we all know so well) go after Lord Shen (a silky smooth Gary Oldman, who's lost none of his vocal talents). Shen wishes to take China by force with something he has invented: the cannon. Faced with a prophecy that a black-and-white warrior will bring him down, Shen makes certain the pandas don't survive ... and that brings us to Po's discoveries about himself.All good and well for a thrilling sequel; the trouble is things are half-baked. There was nothing in the film that confused me, but then I do have decades of Chinese kung fu films and the best comedy in the world to bolster my perception of the hidden stuff, the shining homages. What about the kids? Well, aside from cartoon violence and a scary cannon brigade, nothing is offensive, but I doubt they'll get half the delight out of it that I got.Especially the very deeply embedded anti-communist message among other things.I can only say that the movie is the height of the art form. Oh, it is a sequel in a new franchise, wide open for the inevitable third film. If it is made, it will be a fine trilogy of animation's summit - if not, well, then the two films combined still rank with Buster Keaton's/Jackie Chan's comedies, Run Run Shaw's/Akira Kurosawa's Asian action, and with Disney's finest.It's just a pity there wasn't more to it than this. I've never heard Jack Black fall this flat, but then he had all of three or four lines. They must have recorded him on the fly, back when they finished the 2008 original.Including the vocal talents of Dustin Hoffman, Jean-Claude Van Damme (as adornment mostly because they hardly speak), splendid work by Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Michelle Yeoh, David Cross, Seth Rogen, and inspired performances by the immortal James Hong, Dennis Haysbert, and Victor Garber.

$review_text.: If Imax is now the best quality available on dvd and Anctartica one of the  unexplored wonders of our world, you could expect a visual masterpiece.  This isn't. Nevertheless, it's not terrible either. The problem here is the  lack of empathy that this documentary brings. Yes, penguins look stunning  and glaciers also do the trick, but if you're going to go to a place so  hostile, yet so diverse, as Anctartica you should expect more information,  more soul put into it and, of course, the magic that other documentaries  such as Africa-The Serengeti, Imax-Alaska or The Living Seas display. Buy  it only if you want to complete your Imax collection.

This particular production does as many Shakespearean adaptations have done and reset the play somewhere else.  It took me a bit of time to figure it out, but once I realized Macbeth was supposed to be Josef Stalin, the connections fit right for a rather ingenuous take on an old classic.

$review_text.: Chris Van Allsburg's brisk, haunting storybook is turned into yet another Robin Williams vehicle about getting in touch with your feelings. Williams stars as Alan, a guy trapped for 26 years in the magical board game  Jumanji. When orphans Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce find the game and  roll the dice, they release Alan as well as various marauding beasts that  flatten the sleepy suburbs. The movie gives Alan a cold father who comes  back to haunt him in the form of a psychotic game hunter (both are played  by Jonathan Hyde). The hunter, one can't help noticing, has a big gun.  Freudians should have a field day with the movie: It's crammed with  phallic/vaginal threats, plus constant images of cathartic violation. The  animals, demolishing suburban propriety, are primal therapists.Bonnie  Hunt turns up as Alan's now-grown-up childhood sweetheart, who must spell  out the movie's subtext: The stampeding beasts, and Jumanji itself, are  manifestations of Alan's repressed anger at Dad. Why spend $65 million and  thousands of hours sweating over computers to make a banal fable about the  hazards of bottling up your anger? The animals do put on a show, but some  of them -- particularly the lion and the monkeys, the ones with the most  articulation in their features -- look jerky and plasticized. In format,  &quot;Jumanji&quot; is a mild retread of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (the  director, Joe Johnston, is supposed to direct the third &quot;JP&quot;),  complete with the nuclear family of the guy, the woman, and the two  parentless kids who all come together while fighting or fleeing from  computer-generated critters. It was said to be too scary for kids, but the  scariest thing about it is that it took three guys to write a screenplay  this repetitive and psychologically glib.

$REVIEW.: This Hammer Studios version of the "Hound of the Baskervilles" was filmed in the tradition of creating a colorful, exciting and always action packed movie. Peter Cushing was very properly cast as the great Sherlock Holmes and Christopher Lee starred as Sir Henry Baskerville. It was first released in 1959 and I am sorry to say that I never saw it on a full size theater screen. It is my second favorite release of the "Hound..." relative to Universal's, however, one I was very happy to have discovered on Amazon.com.I enjoyed the lengthy interview with Christopher Lee in which he reported that he and Peter Cushing had become close over the many years of their screen relationship. Many interesting and personnel facts were revealed during this interview, including the fact that Christpher Lee enjoyed playing the part of Sir Henry and especially enjoyed the romantic aspects of this role which enabled him to work closely with a then very popular model of the 50's.I could be wrong but I could swear that some of the sets for Baskerville hall looked very much like redressed versions of portions of the Horror of Dracula set. This excellent DVD transfer will be enjoyed by all fans of Hammer films.

$review_text.: This is one of those films (such as "Lawman") that's slipped under movie-lovers' radars -- and might wind up eventually slipping into non-existence, given the apparent poor condition of most of the prints
I first saw it almost 30 years ago (in a perfect print) after having taped it off a late-night movie show


The VCR's timer had a coding quirk that caused it to stop recording at midnight, so it was a few years before I found out exactly how it ended.It's fair to say "they don't make them like this anymore"

It's a smart, sharp satire of game shows, with Ronald Colman as an out-of-work genius who, insulted by the owner of Milady Soap, decides to bankrupt the company by repeatedly winning on Milady's quiz show

The ending is nicely malicious (anticipating the quiz-show scandals of a decade later), with both Colman and Price getting what they want.Unhesitatingly recommended

If you like bright, intelligent comedies, don't let this one pass by.

 If you want to know more about the show itself, take a look at the reviews of the DVDs.These episodes appear to have been taken from good quality originals

 The show was filmed live, so you have to make some allowances, but there aren't too many defects in the image and the digital conversion doesn't seem to have introduced any new problems.The original commercials are intact


 The show was filmed around the commercials, so cutting them out is not very smooth, although some of the DVD versions have apparently done so.Almost forty episodes for just under $9 seems like a pretty good deal


 I've only watched a few of them, but I will follow up if the quality changes in later episodes.

$review_text.: Stuart LittleScore: 64/100He's clever

He's enthusiastic

He's a can-do little guy with an attitude
And he's a mouse

From the co-director of The Lion King and the writer of The Sixth Sense comes an entertaining family film from classic American author E.B

White
It's surely a star-studded crew there, and there's not much a family of four could white other than a couple of talking mouse's and many exciting scenes


Even though Stuart Little falls flat from a few flaws, it's still a fun children's comedy, that will be worth your time, depending on your feelings towards movies like this.In a cosy house near New York City's Central Park, Mr


and Mrs

Little (Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis) bring home a surprising addition to the family...Stuart (voiced by Michael J

Fox), and he's a er...mouse
Despite the urgings of Mrs


Keeper at the orphanage to adopt within their own species, the Littles beam with the pride of new parents
At home the little guy with a big heart (not to mention whiskers, a little pink nose and a really dapper wardrobe), searches for a sense of belonging and a place to call home in the decidedly supersized world
When Stuart is adopted by the Littles he embarks on an adventure with a variety of characters - including his nemesis, the cat Snowball (voiced by Nathan Lane) - and learns the true meaning of family, loyalty and friendship
The Littles, in the meantime, each discover there is a Stuart in all of us - the spunk, spirit and courage to be true to ourselves and follow our dreams despite the odds.Stuart Little is a good movie, but it suffers majorly from an over-corny note

It's big smiles and drowning frowns all the time, none of the characters ever look normal

Their expressions are practically drawn in, and none of them have much originality about them apart from Stuart, of course
Still, the film provides plenty of entertaining scenes, including an exhilarating cat chase and a superb boat race


It may have a sense of bore in some parts of the film, but overall, it's a very bearable movie that will silent children and, surprisingly, adults for a rainy day
It's a film that combines live action with some groundbreaking visual effects by artists and innovators who have taken digital character creation to a bold new level with the birth of Stuart
The visual effects are the most plausible thing about the film, they are truly memorable, it's some of the most amazingly done animal-talking done since Babe.Not as good as it could've been, Stuart Little is still watchable fun, a film where you can really expect the whole family to enjoy it.

$review_text.: As other reviewers of Set 14 of Midsomer Murders series have noted, its arrival on this side of the pond is well worth the wait.  As has been the case throughout the long run of Midsomer Murders, there are enough red herrings (although, I guess the term should be "blue herrings," in Midsomer) that the viewer's suspicions are cast around the entire ensemble of quirky characters.  The tradition of villages filled with sexual deviance, characters with bizarre affectations, and multiple murders for reasons that are not clear until the final 5 minutes of each episode continues.  So, why not 5 stars?  Some of the energy is missing in Set 14, the image of DCI Barnaby in a suit in sharp contrast to some of the residents of the villages mysteriously vanishes, and the production company's use of actors from previous years is not as satisfying for long-time fans as using new actors might have been.  For example, the image of a obsessive bell ringer and a somewhat-Gothic-looking innkeeper with a buried history of serial murder are so firmly etched on long-time fans that when the actors who portrayed those characters in past seasons are cast as members of an ultra-conservative camera club in Set 14 it just doesn't work as well as it might have.  Still, Set 14 is strong, and it redeems the series from the Set 13 episode, "The Axeman Cometh," one of the least successful episodes in the entire run of the show.  Midsomer Murders is required weekly viewing in our house, and we're looking forward to seeing Cully's wedding in Set 15.  By the way, as John Nettles' run as DCI Barnaby comes to a close, one of the major regrets of the entire Midsomer Murders series is that Caroline Graham's book "A Ghost in the Machine" was never produced for the television series.  The Long and the Tall (for all you long-standing Midsomer Murders fans...): fans should buy Set 14; it is not, however, the strongest set in the run of the series.

$review_text.: I knew this movie was being made long before its trailer hit theaters. Not knowing who the cast, writer and director would be, I was very afraid of a repeat attempt at the kind of Batman that 1997's "Batman & Robin" punished us with. As soon as more info came in and I eventually saw the film. I couldn't believe it. Not only is this a dramatic improvement over the last Batman film, its arguably the best comic book-adaptation film ever made. Being treated like a credible film, you sometimes get the impression you are watching a creepy, gripping psychological drama rather than just a comic-film. Rather than its special effects, stunts, or over-the-top music that drives it; this is helmed by a superior cast and a great script to match. Not to mention the perfect portrayal of the story by director Chris Nolan. Christian Bale simply IS BATMAN! This is Batman the way that Bob Kane originally intended. It is the most exciting, dramatic and emotionally gripping of any of the more recent comic book films, certainly of all of the Batman movies. If you must judge what the Batman character was really meant to be from a movie, make it this one! I'm sure glad I've all the other films first, or this one would make them look like a let-down. DO NOT RENT IT! BUY IT! By, the way, the special features will keep you up watching for hours also. They pretty much hold the same structure as the rereleases of the first four films.

$REVIEW.: The Firebird and Les Noces, two disparate ballets by Igor Stravinsky, are skillfully danced by The Royal Ballet of Covent Garden on this DVD recorded in 2001

The Firebird is a revival of the original Mikhail Fokine choreography
Bronislava Nijinska's Les Noces (The Wedding) is also faithfully reproduced


The scenery and costumes of The Firebird are striking and lavish, while they are plain and austere for Les Noces.The Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, under the able direction of John Carewe, beautifully performs the unabridged score of The Firebird


Before the curtain rises, an on-screen plot synopsis accompanies the first few minutes of music


From start to finish, the well-mannered British audience (as opposed to the typically clap-happy American audience) does not needlessly interrupt the dancing with inappropriate, annoying applause

In the opening scene, Leanne Benjamin, the Firebird, flits across the stage with bird-like jumps


Prince Ivan, Jonathan Cope, appears next, hopping down from the wall that encloses the enchanted garden of the immortal and evil sorcerer Kotschei

Ivan hides, lying in wait to catch the Firebird and seizes her after she steals an apple from the magic tree


What ensues is a captivating performance by Ms Benjamin

Her acting is first-rate but her dancing is inspired, arms waving and hands fluttering

She is the firebird


Her leg work, turns, and jumps (developpes, chaines, and jetes) are marvelously executed
Jonathan Cope's partnering shows sensitivity and deftness

He and Benjamin dance as one, his lifting very silky and effortless


Cope's facial expressions and body language demonstrate fine acting


David Drew as Kotschei is deliciously grotesque: long fingernails, black skeleton costume, flowing cape, humped back, and scraggly beard


His grotesqueness, however, is tinged with humor

Genesia Rosato, the beautiful Tsarevna, is suitably demure


She and her 12 princesses play catch with apples taken from the enchanted tree (not great dancing, but an interesting diversion)
Watching these attractive women in their long nightgowns prancing around the stage provides pleasure


The finale, full of pomp and circumstance, is emotionally and visually satisfying, intensified by a succession of full orchestral chords.In Les Noces, the two principals--Zenaida Yanowsky as the bride and David Pickering her groom--are nice to look at, but they do little dancing
The real stars in this dance-cantata are the men and women (especially the women) of the corps de ballet
Because this is a tricky ballet, full of changing beats and irregular tempos, dancers can easily lose count and make errors

Fortunately, they never do

Nijinska's choreography is just as fresh and modern today as it was when it was first performed in 1923
But the music (composed for four pianos, percussion, small chorus, and four soloists) is what makes this ballet-cantata a masterpiece.These two performances are emotionally and intellectually stimulating
Anyone who appreciates Stravinsky will be rewarded with the purchase of this DVD.

$REVIEW.: Mel Gibson plays Tom Craven, a Boston police detective in this brilliant (and topical) political thriller. This movie is like a sock turned inside out from the original BBC production. In the original, it's a British detective who solves the mystery of his daughter's death with the assistance of an American agent, played quite ably by Joe Don Baker. This one exhibits an American police officer and an emotionally complicated British agent (Ray Winstone).Of the two, I find the Mel Gibson one to be much better. That probably shows my American bias, but the original was a 6 hour miniseries. I can't watch cricket either. I also encourage everyone to watch the original. The complicated relationship between Baker and Peck gives us a deeper insight into the human condition, asking the question "What is right?" Both characters have deep cultural bonds, and both carry out their actions for different reasons. One for simple revenge, the other becomes a dangerous idealist. The ending to the original is slightly different, much more poignant.Both have similiarities in story line, though the American cop has many more action-oriented scenes than the original. Mel Gibson gives us a stunning and brilliant portrayal throughout the film. His Boston accent is perfect, and the supporting cast does a wonderful job, particularly the witty yet sparse banter between Gibson and Ray Winstone. Unlike the original, however, there's not much time to show how their relationship changes both of them, the American and the Brit, the agent and the policeman. I enjoyed the end scene with Ray Winstone. It's surprising. But both films offer wonderful scenes of the main character having conversations with his dead daughter, sometimes tender, sometimes conflicting.I put this movie on the same level as almost all of Mel Gibson's work: well worth watching.

$review_text.: Received my DVD copy last night. My scoop of the day: a) sound effects were above average  (they got an Oscar for it);sounds are precisely located so they match the visual effects in terms of location of event and  distance; b) low-freq sound effects are quite exceptional; particularly,  the far-away rumbles;  c) picture quality is much better than the VHS  (that's expected) d) trailers are the worst ones that I've ever seen.  Unlike other trailers, which tend to over-represent the movie, this one  actually under-represented the movie. Not bad for a collector's edition,  although, I expected the picture quality to be more crisp, considering it's  DreamWorks production.

$REVIEW.: I think people are missing the point of this film when they focus on the action sequence. The underlying theme of the entire movie is one of self sacrifice for what is right and just. It is wrong to conclude that main the character (clint eastwood) pits the two gangs against each other for the money. If that is the case, then why does he give it ALL away to Marisol, to whom he owes NO obligation or favors, at the risk of his own life? Fortunately for the viewers, Marisol does ask why. His answer is "..because...I used to know someone like you..and there was no one to help.." (probably referring to his own mother whom he was powerless to rescue from the raping bandits). That one line says EVERYTHING about his past, his motivation, and the theme of the movie. The director goes to great length to convince the viewer the "man with no name" has no morals. In fact, he seems downright evil and greedy, as he constantly says "I don't work for cheap" and seems to be ready for hire for any sordid duties asked of him for the right price. Only in the very brief and defining moment of the movie (when he rescues Marisol, her son, and her husband) we see him as he truly is. Unlike most westerns, the man does not waste words preaching righteousness, he lets his actions speak for themselves. It is the moral subtlety of this movie which makes it great.

$review_text.: For murder mystery fans who don't mind plots that wander well beyond the realm of credibility, this who-dun-it will keep viewers puzzling over the clues right to the end
Not just a who-dun-it but a what-was-it, the film begins with two violent deaths and in a series of flashbacks reconstructs the series of events leading up to both of them.There's a bit of Jane ("Prime Suspect") Tennyson in Cecilia Roth's portrayal of the investigating magistrate as she pieces together the details of the case, determining how and why three men, all brothers, would confess to the same murder


Entertainingly far-fetched, the film introduces us to a life-celebrating family of Greeks in modern-day Buenos Aires who get mixed up with a sexy femme fatale and the usual corrupt suspects.

$review_text.: This Star Trek version offers a view of a youthful Captain Kirk.  One thing I have to wonder is how did one so young (maybe 32 or so) get to be the Captain of the Enterprise.  He must have been one really extraordinary young man to take the lead over so many others in the Federation who were more mature.  That being said, it requires little time to be captured into the mystique of space travel in a Star Trek episode and this one is no different.  Fast moving and changing plot, exciting scenes, and really only one main antagonist, which is unusual.

'Swamp of the Ravens' IS NOT A ZOMBIE MOVIE!! Beware of the misleading description & reviews! I don't know who's watching what, but there are no undead in this film

It's a rather stupid, boring, nonsensical movie, like most Euro Horror offerings

The storyline is akin to 'Re-Animator', but with most of the storyline missing
Our Dr


Frosta is apparently run out of dodge by his medical board, yet somehow still retains his job while conducting secret experiments at his villa near a swamp


What the experiments are we never really know, but there is mention of an 8-minute time period after brain death where something is supposedly going on


Anyway, the Doc dumps his failed test subjects into the swamp behind his shack, and that's about it
They aren't zombies, they aren't undead, and they certainly don't rise from the grave to seek revenge on Dr


Frosta

They just kinda bob up and down in the water, that's about it
It isn't very creepy imagery at all, it just looks like actors standing in water up to their necks

One victim was a leper, so the face looks pretty rough, but the rest look like mannequins.A very stupid movie that ruins a good horror concept


It would've been great if Dr
Frosta's failed experiments rose out of the swamp and stalked him through his villa, but why do that when you can make a completely incoherent mess of a film that makes no sense whatsoever? I'd much rather see a bad lounge singer (is that an oxymoron?) croon about his robot lady than watch waterlogged zombies rip a guy's heart out
That's what you get with 'Swamp of the Ravens'

How some films get published is beyond me.

$review_text.: Though my opinion may not reflect that of the populous, I must say that I was gravely disappointed with Cameron Diaz's performance in this film. It was strikingly absurd.She, of course, looked wonderful, which may have been a big part of the problem. Diaz tends to look as if she is thrilled even when she is supposed to be a woman repressed. I would assume she could not bring herself to believe the character. Perhaps that is the cause of her stumbling portrayal of A--You see? I just finished watching the film and have completely forgotten the name of the lead.The perennially bubbly Diaz, who may have very well fallen in love with the rambling script, was unable to translate the innumerable complications of the character for which she was cast, leaving this humble viewer at a loss. This storyline would have been better served had an unknown been in her place.There were some very moving scenes that bear viewing- about 1/20th of the film's content.I could charge the director, who rightfully should be made to shoulder some of the blame, or the cinematographer, who oafishly ground several scenes into a clumsy mass, but I won't.Jack Black played his pseudo-type well. Kate Winslet was able to deliver the fine points of Iris' conflicted woe. Eli Wallach erased the seams between personality and self and Jude Law fought graciously to maintain professionalism as he played against a cold fish. (If you look closely, you may be able to detect a tinge of frustration.)I know she could do better.But wait... perhaps I could post a big box of blame to the writers, who numbly delivered a working script full of lame attempts at realism. Nearly, nearly... not quite so. It's a feel-good gone bad, or a mediocre dream gone worse.And thusly, 136 minutes of my sad life gone-- not to mention the expense put towards what became a tortuous non-event-- never to be regained.Ok, so the character's name was Amanda. I admit I remember. Nevertheless, if you're thinking of renting or purchasing this film site-unseen, let me dissuade you. Do not walk the dark path I have walked in order to say you've been there. The journey is just not worth it.Instead, test this alternative trite love flickMusic and Lyrics (Widescreen Edition).You could do worse.

$REVIEW.: This is the performance that introduced this legendary rock band to a new generation in the late 1990's
This is Fleetwood Mac's first performance together in over 10 years, since Lindsey left the band in 1987, filmed live on a LA soundstage before many of Hollywood's elite


The entire band rocks out on every single song - there is not one bad performance on this DVD

The sound of the band and the quality of the DVD sound is EXCELLENT
Above all, the interaction between band members, particularly Lindsey &amp; Stevie, is PRICELESS


As Stevie Nicks said of this performance &quot;As magic as it gets, it was.&quot; Stevie Nicks proves her standing as The Queen of Rock on every song, turning on all of her trademark moves, not to mention looking and sounding incredibly beautiful


Christine McVie, equally as graceful and beautiful, treats the audience to a few of her Fleetwood Mac hits, and Lindsey proves that Fleetwood Mac just isn't the same without him
The audience is treated to a few surprises, including an emotional &quot;Landslide&quot; (the version you hear on the radio was taken from this performance) which shows clear reconsiliation between Lindsey &amp; Stevie, a visit from the USC marching band on &quot;Tusk&quot; (they also played on the &quot;Tusk&quot; album)and an AWESOME performance between Lindsey &amp; Stevie of her Grammy nominated &quot;Silver Springs&quot;

The album version of this performance was nominated for a Grammy &amp; went to #1 on the charts - you'll wonder why it didn't win an Oscar for best real-life drama after you see this one! The only set back is that &quot;Stand Back&quot; and &quot;Little Lies&quot; are not included on this performance, yet you couldn't ask for more after you finish watching it! This DVD proves why Fleetwood Mac is one of rock's most legendary bands! You'll watch it over and over again!

$REVIEW.: This old classic (with photographer James Stewart confined to his apartment with a cast on his leg and his girlfriend Grace Kelly providing legs for their sleuthing) never fails to satisfy. And it's really, really scary, especially the scene where the suspected murderer (Raymond Burr with menacing gaze and heavy brow) sees Kelly twiddling her finger behind her back, glances out the window and up, up, up to where Stewart is framed in his apartment window across the courtyard. Ridiculous, but even as I type this, I'm getting goosebumps.The beauty of this film is the way it plays on the role of the voyeur. Stewart amuses himself by spying on his neighbors in the apartment buildings that surround his Greenwich Village courtyard - and we, the viewing audience, get to peek over his shoulder. It's incredibly titillating - until Burr's invalid wife goes missing.Terrific cure for boredom, both Stewart's and ours, especially with the truly terrifying conclusion.

$review_text.: A lot of people I know compare this film to `American Beauty', and I totally understand why.  Both films explore suburban family life in a way that is honest and flawed and completely exploitive without ever appearing overdone or, well, exploitive.  I completely adore both films, but while `American Beauty' excels in really capturing the insecurities and eventual demise of the middle-aged man, `The Ice Storm' takes a different route (albeit similar circumstances) in that it exposes the moral breakdown of the average family.Both films involve a family unit, complete with children, and both films expose a marriage on the rocks (complete with an affair) as well as childish rebellion and self discovery on both sides of the spectrum, but to be `The Ice Storm' works a little more in that it actually feels invested in every character.Outside of Spacey, `American Beauty' loses some footing.Ben and Elena Hood are seemingly happy parents with a daughter at home and a son off in school, but when their son Paul comes home for a visit they begin to visibly unravel.  Both Paul and his sister Wendy are beginning to explore their own individuality, which as per usual involves some sort of distorted intimacy, and this coincides with their parents beginning to acknowledge their own inadequacies.  Ben has been fooling around with Janey Carver, the mother of Mikey, Wendy's current flame.  Elena is most likely privy to the affair, even if she refuses to admit it to herself, but what is even more pertinent is that the children here all know and understand far more than the parents want to believe.What is so beautiful (tragically so) about `The Ice Storm' is that it exposes the messes we parents make while we falsely believe that our children are too young to understand all that they are witnessing.Sigourney Weaver's character Janey is the perfect example of this very idea.Across the board the film is filled with stellar performances that really ignite on contact.  Kevin Kline has rarely been better (and when you consider that he also starred in the uproarious `In & Out' this same year you really have to hand it to him) and Joan Allen is all sorts of stellar as Elena, giving her a true sense of uninformed (or should I say unacknowledged) dread.  Tobey Maguire, Adam Hann-Byrd, Christina Ricci (OMG amazing here), Elijah Wood and Katie Holmes all astound in their roles (some great child acting here); but it is one name that resounds loudest and that is Sigourney Weaver.  Her understanding of the unaccepted flaws of Janey is just marvelous.  That final scene, after the party, alone in the house and then suddenly aware of the truth; it's just a heart-stopper.In the end I must say that `The Ice Storm' is one of the most sublimely done films on family tension I've ever seen, exposing the heart of human frailty without coming across as preachy, contrived or clich&eacute;d.  It is honest, dark and surprisingly inspired, and the final moments (where eyes are opened for the very first time) add a layer of hope that is much needed in the world we live in today.Bravo.

$REVIEW.: I got this after watching a few episodes on t.v. it was truly a very interesting series and story concept.  The one thing I feel for myself that is a little irritating is that unlike most Anime series this show doesn't give you a true bad guy to really hate.  Some would say the character Light is bad but I disagree yes he is a megalomaniac but in his view he isn't trying to just rule the world he wants to make it a betterworld without the crime and hatred he sees in the current world order.  Just as there isn't a true villain I really didn't see to much of a true hero either except maybe the detective character L and one or two others but most of the other characters either side with Light(Kira to the public)or just doing what the political bodies of Japan and the United States want them to do.  So All I say about this is if you like a gooddrama/supernatural anime with a good storyline get this dvd but if you like the kind of series that have a discernible villain or hero this series would probably be not for you

$review_text.: A lot of the times as a filmmaker's career goes on there comes a time when their movies sometimes start to lack. Of course there will always be exceptions. Some filmmakers can remain solid through their career, some make decent flicks later in their career and there are others who make mostly bad movies late in their career and sadly, Fulci falls into the latter.By the time Demonia was released Lucio Fulci was far past his prime and most of his movies around the mid 80s really weren't very good. Even his better movies from that era weren't very well made, but might have worked on the so bad its good level like Zombie 3. With Demonia Fulci tries to go back to trying to make a more suspenseful flick added with some of his trademark gore. The good thing about Demonia is Fulci goes back to his visual style that helped make some of his movies better than they should have been, but despite that Demonia doesn't quite work, while it does have it's moments it's also a little too slow paced.The screenplay was written by Lucio Fulci and Piero Regnoli and it really wasn't very good. In the horror genre you can get away with a sub-par script, but sometimes you can't. Most Fulci's movies didn't have very good scripts; often the characters would say and do some rather idiotic things. But he was able to get away with it. The screenplay pretty much lacks any logic, which was typical of Fulci in the 80s.Fulci was able to write some good screenplays, Don't Torture a Duckling is proof of that. But this time around the screenplay lacks logic and is never really interesting with the exception of a couple moments. Piero Regnoli wrote the cult classics Nightmare City and Burial Ground, but Regnoli and Fulci for the most part don't get much going. Though of all the Fulci flicks I have seen this isn't the worst written, that honor goes to Touch of Death.Again by this time Fulci was far removed from his prime, but he was still trying to hold on and capture his past glory. He changed his style during the mid to late 80s and if not for his name listed as director you would never know since there wasn't much of his style shown. Here, in Demonia the camera shots are very Fulci and his close up of the eyes is done a lot here.For the most part Demonia though lacks any real suspense, while he is able to craft some fairly decent scenes, most never really go anywhere. Had Demonia been made 7 or 8-years earlier it probably would have been one of his more solid films. Demonia was done by a director who had seen better days, but for what it's worth, Fulci's visual style makes this movie slightly better than it should have been. Though you know things are bad when you resort to knocking off your own movies. The first few minutes remind me of The Beyond and City of the Living Dead.The gore level is fairly decent, but some of the F/X are a bit weak, but overall are enjoyable, but it does take a while before we get to the good stuff and the payoff isn't as good as it was back in the early 80s. Though the human wishbone scene was kinda cool, but not as good as it could have been.The final act is quite idiotic; while there is at least some action it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but than again most of Demonia doesn't make any sense. It seemed like a good idea, but somewhere along the way it never really works well. In some of Fulci's movies things happen and we never really are told why and same thing happens here. Demonia is rather incoherent, which was something a lot of Fulci's movies were, but due to the suspense and gore it worked, but in Demonia it's rather annoying.The cast was rather weak; Fulci again teams with Brett Halsey who was far better here than in Touch of Death. Fulci, regular Pierluigi Conti best known to horror fans as Al Cliver appears in a small role under the name Al Clever. I wonder if that was a spelling mistake. Meg Register while nice to look at gives a rather forgettable performance.The man himself Lucio Fulci appears as Inspector Carter; Lucio Fulci made a lot of cameos in his movies, but this time around his role is actually fairly decent. He enters the movie around the 40-minute mark and has a couple of scenes instead of the typical cameo.Demonia is one of the last movies Lucio Fulci would make before his death in 1996. I have seen different listings for the release and he did either 2 or 3 more movies depending on which is the correct release date. Demonia is only for the hardcore Fulci fans. Anyone else it's best to skip this movie.In closing, Demonia isn't the worst movie Lucio Fulci has done, but it's nowhere near one of his best. Demonia has some fairly decent moments, but overall it never quite works.

 Sure, he had problems professionally and in life like the rest of us, but you know what?  The essence of this man transcended all of that, and I believe that is why we are all so drawn to his films today
 Not only that, but this film takes place when the movies were  leaving hoofers (tap dancing) behind, and moving into the realm of modern dance and ballet
 Even in those territories, Fred holds his own


 It is my belief that the decline in the producing and popularity of musicals from the late 40's and 50's to this day is because we left tap dancing (primal rhythm) behind for a mode that was too effete for most people to be affected by.As for the film, great!!!

$REVIEW.: Based on H.G. Wells' book, "War Of The Worlds" had everything it needed to be a superb film, but it was as dull as the thud of the alien tripods' feet.  The film started out very well, with plenty of build-up to prepare the viewer for what was to happen.  The relentless alien attack was very tense.  There was plenty of pop and fizzle to grab the eyes.  Even in the basement, this film was very tense.  However, the conclusion to this film was wretched.  It totally killed any and every ounce of anxiety that was built up throughout the bulk of the film.  Unlike M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs," in which the conclusion was both clever and unexpected, I knew all along what would kill off the aliens.  Unfortunately, I was hoping very terribly that I was wrong.  Whether this was true to the book or not, this was a horrible ending.  Besides, it's called a "War" and there was little of that going on.  We are mostly shown thousands of people running for their lives, screaming in fear, with no clue as to what is going on.  When we do see the military, they are getting creamed by these big, bulky tripod vehicles piloted by aliens that look like a cross between the "Independence Day" alien and the man-eating plant from "Little Shop of Horrors."Though I won't reveal exactly what kills the aliens (admit it, you know humanity prevails, so I'm not spoiling anything here), I will say that I hoped for it to at least be pollution or Barbra Streisand.  There aren't any brilliant scientists who figure out that rum combined with Coke proves to be fatal or even a computer virus as in "ID4."  Instead, we are given one of the most anti-climactic endings I've seen in years.  It's as if Spielberg was thinking, "Okay, we've offed enough humans and sprayed enough red vines, let's kill off the aliens with....."The special effects, for the most part, are very impressive.  However, in one particular scene, when Tom Cruise crawls out of a basement, the setting is so obviously a studio stage that it's pitiful.  In fact, when Cruise came out of the basement, it looked as if he stepped into the forest where Dorothy found the Tinman in "Wizard of Oz."  It was totally laughable and killed the movie's tension abruptly.As far as acting goes, I just couldn't believe Cruise as a down-on-his-luck average joe with a busted family.  He was okay, but he just didn't work as Ray Ferrier.  Dakota Fanning was pretty good in the other movies I've seen her in, but all she did in this movie was scream and annoy the fire out of me.  In fact, the only likeable character in this whole flick is Cruise's son Robbie (Justin Chatwin).  Tim Robbins plays a man who saves Cruise and Fanning, but totally wigs out as his time in the basement moves along.In all actuality, I should give this film only two stars, but the film is so good up until the last twenty or thirty minutes that I do believe it is worthy of at least one viewing.  Also, the special effects really are excellent excepting the silly "Oz" set.This is definitely a rental.  I would not purchase this flick unless I was a die-hard Spielberg or Cruise fan.  If you're wanting to see aliens and man go toe-to-toe, watch "ID4."  It isn't half as intelligent as this flick, but at least we kick a little more butt than this dud.

$review_text.: I love Vincent D'Onofrio and that is why I bought this movie and I have to say this was one of his best performances I have seen. The movie has little blood and guts in it but the implied horror that takes place left me scared out of my wits. I had trouble sleeping. If you like Vincent or a good murder mystery, then you have to get this movie. I promise you, you will not be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd have made their share of trash, but this Cold War spoof isn't half-bad.  When supported by a solid script, or at least a promising set-up, Chase can be hysterical.  And this movies gives him a lot of material to work with.  The classroom scene might be the single funniest moment in Chevy's career.  With the exception of Caddyshack, his timing has never been this pitch-perfect.  Aykroyd, as usual, plays the slightly quirky straight man.  Nothing wrong with that, since his better film work usually consists of fulfilling this role (Ghostbusters, Trading Places).  Spies Like Us won't blow you mind, but it does have moments of inspiration.

$REVIEW.: I sometimes wonder whether Fox Searchlight is a term meaning indie stuff that Steve is quite likely to enjoy. It's amazing how often that's true. My favorites from Fox Searchlight include The Descendants, Juno, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Darjeeling Limited, Slumdog Millionaire, Thank You for Smoking, Once, 127 Hours, Black Swan, Little Miss Sunshine, and Martha Marcy May Marlene.The movie immediately grabbed my attention during the opening credits which contain the following message:AUTHOR'S NOTE: The following is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to any persons living or dead is purely coincidental.Especially you Jenny Beckman.B*tch.Yes, (500) Days of Summer is deliberately quirky. It tells the story of the relationship between Tom Hansen (Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Deschanel). Because the majority of the events have already happened, the story is told in a series of flashbacks from Tom's viewpoint. To muddle things further, it jumps around at random, using title cards to show which of the 500 days of the relationship is being remembered. This has the effect of keeping us off balance; one moment we are sharing Tom's hope that he will end up with Summer, and then we see the relationship already established and about to fall apart. If it had been told in a strictly linear fashion, it wouldn't have worked so well.Other storytelling devices involve the use of a sarcastic narrator, a split screen showing Tom's expectations and the reality, and his discussions with his sister, Rachel (Moretz), who is about 11 years old. I particularly liked Rachel's character. Although she's just 11, she makes a lot more sense than her older brother. She's deliberately portrayed as being wise and intelligent, and her simple advice seems so obvious that we wonder why Tom has made his relationship with Summer as complicated as it is.Why is it complicated?Summer doesn't like to label things, so she doesn't want to be thought of as Tom's girlfriend, insisting that they are friends. Tom feels insecure without that defined structure, and wants to know where the relationship is heading. He thinks that two people who regularly have sex must be more than friends. Summer insists that she doesn't believe in true love, and just wants to have fun.Many of the scenes are genuinely funny. Tom works as a greeting card writer, and his failing relationship starts to bleed into his work. I can't reveal exactly how, but you'll laugh when you see the scene. Another strong element is music. Tom is portrayed as someone who grew up listening to sad British punk bands, and I smiled when he's shown wearing Joy Division T-shirts. He first attracts Summer's attention by listening to The Smiths when she bumps into him in an elevator. There's also a good scene which takes place at a karaoke bar, which showcases Deschanel's singing ability and has Tom performing a passable version of The Pixies' Here Comes Your Man.Apart from wanting to be in a serious relationship with Summer, Tom also dreams of being an architect. One of his favorite spots to view buildings sets the scene for several of his memories from the 500 days. Summer is an administrative assistant at Tom's company and apparently doesn't dream about doing anything else with her life.Relationships are unpredictable, and I think that the movie is using the unconventional narrative to stress that point. It's not something to be taken seriously, but there are a few truths revealed along its meandering journey. I've watched it several times, but I have to be in the right mood. It's the sort of movie that might be annoying if you are looking for something with a definite message.The $7.5 million budget seems tiny in comparison to director Marc Webb's next feature, The Amazing Spider-Man (estimated at $230 million), but it's a good first effort.Zooey Deschanel seems ideal for these kind of roles, whereas Joseph Gordon-Levitt has shown that he can mix comedy with serious drama. If you want an example, look no further than the excellent 50/50.If you're in the mood for quirky comedy, or like the actors involved, (500) Days of Summer is worth checking out.Overall score 3.75/5

$REVIEW.: This review may be construed as containing spoilers. But they are mild ones, because while I will be hinting at specifics of content, I do not aim to steal the thunder of the films makers. I think the episodes of this film that you'll want to keep -- and which I doubt you'll be able to get off your mind in any event -- are the middle two.The first and last episode feel somewhat like preachments, whether or not one agrees with them (and they do enlist your sympathy as well as they could, setting politics aside, for being so well made). The first episode is marred by an unconvincing, stereotyped portrayal of the tourists. This is the most awkward epsiode of the four, and that's a little sad because the core story it tells -- of a good woman reduced to the practice of the oldest profession in order to survive -- is credible and involving. Awkward moments or no, episode 1 is shot with a genius eye, and movingly acted in part. The female lead is good. So are the unprofessional "faces" that fill out the background. And the ending is just the right finish for the piece -- tense and sobering.The last story hooks you and holds you for a good while with the story of a rural mountain family held in primal struggle with survival. But at fade out of this interlude, the escalating giddiness of the episode climaxes in shots of comrades with their arms locked around each other's shoulders, enveloped in the poetic swirl of the smoke of battle, waving flags and swelling Russian patriotic music. It is hard to see this sort of scene at this point and not think of a tv commercial (with its over-the-top foreshortening into "big moments") or outright parody. Still, one hesitates to dismiss the episode because for the first half its length, it is engrossing, and you do become deeply involved in and care about the proceedings.Now, to the perfect parts of I Am Cuba. The second story, the one about the old-before-his-time sugar cane planter, plays like a short story from William Faulkner. It's not overstating it to say that this is crafted from the purest material of the human spirit. It leaves volumes unspoken between the lines of it's visually lush yet expeditious narrative. I don't want to spoil it for you, so I won't give too much away. But I will alert you to watch for the telescoping of the farmer's young life into an impressionistic collage early in the episode. It's brilliant.The third episode relates the vascillations of a revolutionary youth perhaps too burdened with conscience for what he is about, and the consequence of his hesitation, with the utterly devastating irony of de Maupassant. I have never seen the lead actor here in anything else, but he is perfect in this. Great casting. As a true antihero, a man whose courage fails him at a critical moment, he feels like the genuine article. The episode dovetails into something patriotic and somewhat overblown, but what goes before that ending is nothing short of great film making. Deeply felt. Insightful. Indelible.The thing that sold me on I Am Cuba is the fact that Cranes Are Flying, by the same director, Kalatozov, is one of my favorite films. In that film, too, Kalatozov gambles with going too far for the chance of tapping into huge, operatic feeling. I think it works. It is an emotionally overwrought and somewhat sentimental approach. But one accepts the approach because you sense that Kalatozov believed in it himself, and hadn't been prodded by someone else, with a more mercenary eye, to turn on the waterworks. Kalatozov is often compared in some way to Eisenstein. In terms of material, especially, I suppose this is apt. But to me, a more apt comparison might be to Frank Capra. If you aren't completely on board with this director, he may seem emotionally manipulative or cornball to you. If you are, you'll be swabbing away the tears a few times during his films, at moments of filmed life that you'll never forget.Five stars, highest recommendation.

$review_text.: I am sorry to say that the 'new' version of Peter Pan does not leave out the terribly racist scene depicting Indians as redmen unable to speak in complete sentences, willing to make anyone a member of their tribe and hand out eagle feathers to anyone who comes around. I am surprised this flies now a days, but apparently people aren't bothered by racism when those offended are fewer in numbers. It would be interesting to see what the backlash would be if this were another minority group.If you wish to raise tolerant children, pick another movie.

$REVIEW.: John Tyree (Channing Tatum), a sergeant on leave, meets a college student Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried) on spring break in his hometown in North Carolina. Knowing that they have to go back to their life in two weeks, they fall in love with each other. But John and Savannah maintain their relationship through letters, and John will soon leave the army so that they can live together, but things turn out not the way they planned."Dear John" is based on a 2006 book written by Nicholas Sparks, original author of such romantic dramas as "Message in a Bottle," "A Walk to Remember," "Nights in Rodanthe" and yes, "The Notebook," but the film somehow lacks the emotional charge of the Ryan Gosling / Rachel McAdams romance. It seems director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, known for "My Life as a Dog" and "The Cider House Rules" is trying too hard to make everything so sweet or so bitter, without allowing us to know the central characters John, John's father, Savannah and her neighbor Tim (Henry Thomas).In "Dear John," most characters are nice (like in any Nicholas Sparks adaptations), but their motives for takings action are not always convincing. To explain the decision made (one that is hard to do), one character says, "I had no choice." Sorry, but I just don't believe it. The consequences may be heartbreaking, but they are contrived. The final act is rushed, as if several key scenes are deleted. The subplot about John's quiet father (Richard Jenkins) and his childhood memories don't add up to much.Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried are doing their best, injecting some much-needed passion into the characters they play, but under Hallstr&ouml;m vapid direction, they have no chance. "Dear John" is an unabashed tearjerker (and that is not a bad thing), that needs a better storyteller.

$review_text.: and you'll think this is a better-than-average made-for-TV (even though it wasn't) movie, and you'll appreciate the book even more.Let's start with the cons:  The book was set in the late 1950's (around 1957, I think, and I know I'm comparing to the book, but bear with me), whereas the movie is set in present-day.  This presents many problems.Just an aside:  "A Walk to Remember" by Nicholas Sparks was set in 1958 and when it was translated to the screen, it lost a lot of its charm because it was set in the present.  There's just a certain charm about time past that cannot be duplicated in the here and now.Anyway, fast-forwarding the book about thirty years, it lost something.  The children would have been much more innocent, but then again, Jeb Stuart Adams and Kristy Swanson were MUCH too old for the roles.  I know they were supposed to be older going into the attic than they were in the book (I am guessing Chris and Cathy are the same age going into the attic in the movie as they were coming out in the book), but Jeb Adams was twenty-seven, and he looked it.  And am I the only one who noticed the children more resembled displaced Amish children (Chris wears suspenders and what was with Cathy and those dowdy dresses?) than the Dresden dolls they were supposed to be?These children did not look Aryan enough--yes, they had blond(e) hair, though I didn't notice any blue eyes, and Cory's curly hair made him look Jewish (which would have been fine, if this was a story about Jewish children, but it wasn't), neither were any of these children stunning; they were all rather ordinary looking (Kristy Swanson was somewhat pretty, at least before her hair got chopped off).  Though Victoria Tennant is elegant and attractive (but not as) in a Grace Kelly sort of way, she looked a bit tired.  As for the father, well, I imagined a much handsomer man (think Jeffrey Hunter with blond hair), but oh, well.But it was the children's ages that were worse.  The twins were fine, but Chris and Cathy were post-pubescent in the movie, as opposed to pre-pubescent in the book (though Chris is fourteen in the book, he doesn't start growing hair in certain places until later), which explains why the children in the book held out for as long as they did before escaping.  It is much easier to control a fourteen-year-old boy than a boy old enough to serve in the military.I think the worst scene of the film was when Chris and Cathy are on the bus in the daytime and Cathy is going on about how they never had a pet, about how they should have had one so they could get used to death, or some such nonsense as that, so that she would know that fathers die, even handsome, wonderful ones, too.  It was so totally pointless.I also think the fact that they arrived at Foxworth Hall during the daytime and through the front door instead of in the dark of night through the back deflated some of the mystery.  The cinematography could have been darker in some places, lighter in others.  Instead, it always seemed like it had just rained.We are given just a glimpse of what life was like, how sunny yellow it was, before Chris Sr.'s death.I didn't really mind the ending with Corinne dying, being hung by her wedding veil, because I really do see a book and a movie made from it as two separate works of art.  That's how Margaret Mitchell felt about "Gone with the Wind".  Though I read somewhere a sequel was planned, I am not sure how they would have went about doing that as "Petals on the Wind" focused not only on Cathy's exciting and versatile love life, but on getting revenge on her mother.Cathy's character was just totally different in the movie (and so was Carrie's--Carrie was a little spitfire in the book) and in leaving out the incest between Chris and Cathy, it lost something.  Chris was just blah and Cory was cute and all, but not much else.  The female characters dominated this film.Overall, the movie was just a low-budget, lackluster production.Now for the pros:  The haunting, chilling score (I'm still not sure how I feel about Cathy's narrating), and Louise Fletcher was perfect as the grandmother.  This flick is entertaining enough because when I watched it before I even knew of the book's existence, I was intrigued.  I've watched it twice since then and have the same opinion I've had since reading the book--that it could have been so much better, but better had it not been done at all.  What's in my imagination is better than anything they can put on film.  I've found the best movies are made out of bad books.Watch it once or twice, maybe even a third time with a friend, but that's about it.  The book has much more readability.
$SUMMARY.: Watch the movie first...

$REVIEW.: There stands Jeff Daniels, holding a shovel, ready to strike at the predators that would do his family harm. Only minutes before, his family is running up the stairs, as if trying to escape something massive and deadly. What's ironic about the situation in &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; is that there are no gruesome monsters or devilish people running amuck in the small town setting, but instead, a simple fear is given a whole new name as innumerable tiny spiders begin a rampage that makes for one of the best movies of 1990.&quot;Arachnophobia,&quot; which, appropriately defines a fear of spiders, presents us with a plotline that pits man again nature, calling attention to the horror movies of the old days while taking its title and creating an immense amount of tension and suspense with unique story twists and some nicely added comic relief. I did find the movie to be predictable in places, but that didn't stop me from having an enormous amount of fun with it.The movie begins in Venezuela, where an expedition into the tropical forests leads to the discovery of a previously unknown species of arachnid. A photographer along for the ride is bitten by the spider and dies of convulsions, yet the cause of death remains unknown to everyone else, and so the body, along with the stowaway spider, is shipped back to his hometown of Canaima, where a new doctor is also moving in.Having moved from San Francisco to begin a practice in the small town, Dr. Ross Jennings, with his wife and two children, is dismayed when he learns that the previous doctor has decided not to retire. Beginning a practice of his own, he starts out with one patient, who is bitten by a deadly spider which was spawned in the barn in the backyard of Jennings' house. This, along with many other deaths, raise questions about the circumstances of the deaths, and as the facts are slowly revealed, the tension becomes increasingly delicious as the arachnids begin taking over the town.The mark of a truly good film is its ability to stay in touch with a certain message in its title in order for it to make sense. &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; is magnificent in its achievement of this goal, taking the minute fear of spiders and turning it into something quite suspenseful. This is done by placing a spider in almost every scene, and centering that specific part of the story around something that has to do with it, or them. One minute we see a lone creature, and the next there are thousands of them crawling across dry grass, up walls, and sometimes, on people.And these aren't the textbook spiders who merely hunt their prey from their spun webs and await some unsuspecting insect to fly into their trap. These arachnids are hunters, out for a taste of any kind of blood they can lay their fangs on. They are fast and unrelenting, vicious and brutal, and altogether extremely scary.The story is a well-spun (pardon the pun) piece of work which presents its elements well. The beginning takes things in stride by introducing us to the characters fluidly, and then slowly builds up to a heightened amount of suspense by placing those characters into extreme situations. We can care for what happens to the characters because we know who they are: Jennings' fear of spiders is presented, which comes into play with his confrontation with the spider.The spider makes a truly marvelous enemy, and Ross Jennings is an equally engrossing hero in the final act. Played by Jeff Daniels, his stand-off with the queen spider is just as good as any modern-day action sequence you'll see. We have a slight idea of what is going to happen, but Daniels' acting not only brings out the immense fear in his character, but keeps us at bay, wanting more until the climax reaches its peak. And to allay some of the tension comes John Goodman as an extremely hilarious exterminator who jumps in to save the day in his own little way.&quot;Arachnophobia&quot; does many different things for me: it certainly makes me think twice before reaching into my popcorn bowl, putting on my shoes or a football helmet. But, it also is a great ride, with lots of thrills and even more chills to please all. Fear will never be the same again!

$REVIEW.: If like me, you saw the film in a theater last year and weren't sure you wanted to buy the DVD outright, don't think twice.  It's a `must have'!  Amazon doesn't list it, but there's 75 MINUTES OF OUTTAKE INTERVIEWS (!), all of which are as compelling as those that are shown in the film.  There's even some stuff that the filmmakers tacked on about the 2004 election results that detail the contradictory nature of the exit polls and the conflict of interest (if you are a person who believes in democracy) regarding the voting machines.  It's no accident that in the past couple of years, there's been a deluge of documentaries regarding the corruption of our government at every level.  If the media really was fair and balanced and practiced real journalism, films like this wouldn't have to be made. Some may scream `liberal bias', but one would really have to be in a major state of denial to not question why the media doesn't investigate itself in regards to any of the issues brought up in this film.  What are they afraid of?  This film supplies you with ample evidence that will explain why the media will never dig beneath its own very superficial surface.  I'd say that this film, "The Corporation", "Mark Crispin Miller's 'A Patriot Act'", and "Hijacking Catastrophe: 9/11, Fear & The Selling of American Empire", are extremely vital films to be passed around to everyone you know.  Think of Winston Smith, scribbling away in a corner.  Keep that flow of information alive!

Something goes awry, and suddenly Wahlberg's character (Swagger)is a fugitive. There is a nice plot here with a well-timed twist.  There is also plenty of action with car chases, gun fights and explosions galore. It ends in a most satisfying way. Danny Glover and Michael Pena also star, and give solid performances.

$REVIEW.: I was in the Marine Corps, (Viet Nam) and while it seems like such a bunch of drunks, in reality, we did work hard, and &#34;played&#34; hard. I remember a couple of marines who were gung ho, and very similar to &#34;Santini&#34; in the movie.  It was touching, and sad, funny, yet realistic.  We all should remember there are many such veterans, (and their families) who never really have a home, just a house.  They move, and are separated about half of a career marine's tour.  They all sacrifice for the safety of our country, and we own them the security of our freedom.
$SUMMARY.: A must see movie, even if it is a little "dated".

$REVIEW.: How can people love Braveheart and then turn around and call this film tripe because it's not historically accurate?  Oh, please.  Braveheart was a great movie, I love it, but history it ain't!  Whether Arthur the King is or is not faithful to the legend - WHO CARES?  Was any version that has been done on the round table accurate?  I sincerely doubt it.  None come to my mind!  Most Arthurian Legends come from the faerytales of Camelot written in the Middle Ages, by an author who dressed the knights and ladies according to that period.So take a deep breath, sit back and watch the film without hanging onto the romantic images like Linus holds onto his blanket and really watch great storytelling - key words STORY TELLING - in action.  This movie is beautiful filmed, grimly realistic - as Hollywood generally can get.  The wide screen version of the directors cut is magnificent.I really don't see why you have to compare apples or oranges.  I happen to love them both.History it ain't - same as Braveheart, same as Excalibur, same as every Hollywood historical film ever lenses.  When so few historical films are done, its great to see one filmed with such passion, quality and eye for detail.If you want historical Arthur - go seek ye yond history book and MAYBE you will find a trace of him.  Other wise, don't whine this is not accurate.Just enjoy fine storytelling.

$REVIEW.: The first and maybe most realistic vehicle for Chevy Chase as his family attempts to traverse most of the country in search of a theme park. The characters, the situations are all easy to watch including that old trooper Imogene Coca who I remember from my youth. It is hard to imagine anyone in this country at least, not finding something to latch onto as the Griswolds make their debut. If all movies were like this one it would be too much to handle but a little diversion is always nice.

$REVIEW.: Get Him to the Greek is the latest Judd Apatow-produced comedy, a semi-sequel to Forgetting Sarah Marshall that allows scene-stealing rock star Aldous Snow (brilliantly played by Russell Brand) to take center stage


Get Him to the Greek is consistently funny with likeable, down-to-earth characters and though much different in tone from Forgetting Sarah Marshall it's one of the funniest comedies I've seen in 2010.Aldous Snow was a successful rock musician with seven years of sobriety under his belt last time we saw him

Now, after his new record is a disastrous flop, he retreats from the music scene and returns to a life of rock star excess
Jonah Hill (who played an obsessive fan of Snow's in FSM) plays Aaron Green, an aspiring record executive at Pinnacle Records
His boss Sergio (Sean "Diddy" Combs) assigns Aaron the task of escorting Aldous Snow from London to Los Angeles for a 10-year-anniversary show at the Greek Theatre within 72 hours

Obviously, hilarity then ensues...Writer/director Nicholas Stoller gives us a pretty simple setup but also incorporates elements of drama in the same way FSM did

Some of these dramatic scenes work; others feel uninspired and rushed
That aside, I would award the film five stars if not for the last thirty minutes, where the film suddenly loses steam and even sways toward the generic a bit


The threesome scene is particularly notable as being a joke that begins as amusing but quickly wears out it's welcome and is dragged on just a bit to long


The humor here will appeal to a broad spectrum of comedic tastes as it's both intelligent and immature, but the jokes come so furiously that when one brings the film down, another is there to pick it back up


I can't think of a scene from a comedy this year that is as funny as the Las Vegas/"Geoffrey" scene in this film; the scene is an absolute riot, brilliantly scripted and performed


This film is also home to some of the year's most terrific throwaway lines ("It's Kubrickian," "Randy Quaid maybe," etc.).As with any Apatow produced film, it's the actors that really carry the film though


Russell Brand and the character Aldous Snow obviously share many similarities, but that doesn't take away from how brilliantly well Brand portrays Snow


Humor aside, he is very convincing in the emotional scenes and when he has to perform music he does it with just the right amount of bravado

Incredibly, Brand proves to be a talented singer and it's believable that Snow could actually be a successful rock musician

The reason this film was made though and what really keeps the film moving is the chemistry between Brand and Jonah Hill


Both have a very different comedic styles (Brand being more flamboyant, Hill being more deadpan), but they complement each other perfectly and it's a joy seeing them share the screen together again

Main stars aside, the film's rock star/celebrity cameos and Apatow regulars turning up in bit parts also work very well

Lars Ulrich has a surprisingly amusing cameo that doesn't feel forced and out of place and the appearance of Tom Felton of "Harry Potter" fame is not wasted.While it is Brand and Hill's film much of their thunder is stolen by a rather surprising contender in the form of Mr

Sean "Diddy" Combs


From the first moment he appears onscreen, Combs completely steals the show from everyone


It's hard to imagine that the artist formerly known as Puff Daddy could make such an impression, but playing an eccentric record executive seems to have put Combs in his element as his character has some of the most memorable, hilarious lines

It's no exaggeration that Combs puts everyone else he shares a scene with to shame

It's a terrific performance that will have you clutching your stomach with laughter at times.Get Him to the Greek is not a perfect film nor is it a perfect comedy, but much of it is brilliant


It is one of the most pleasing and enjoyable comedies of the year
I would welcome a sequel to the film and, while it lacks the depth of FSM, it's arguably just as funny.The double-disc edition of the DVD is definitely worth purchasing


As usual, it contains both the rated and unrated versions of the film and the bonus features aren't anything "new," but they are insightful and hilarious


There are three, fairly extensive behind-the-scenes documentaries talking about the film and the music that drives the film
Of course, there's also gag reels, deleted scenes, alternate endings, etc


I typically ignore these features on a DVD, but these features are really funny and worth watching.MOVIE: BDVD: A-

Even Harold Lloyd tried helping his career, so he had some great pals helping him.In the DVD it is said that Chaplin had one star that intimidated him;it was Langdon. That's how strong a star he was.For Langdson afficionados, I was impressed of films I've tried to see for 40 years but was never recovered, here in this package INCLUDING an 'infomercial' for GOODRICH tires that was never put in his filmography till now. The commentaries were excellent,except for one who got so technical about film stock that it was boring(HIS FIRST FLAME).At least his son, Harry Langdon, the famous LA photographer is doing well. Too bad that they didn't interview for this package BUT highly recommended for ANY comedy fans to check the evolution of great comedians. Thanks Harry!!!

$review_text.: It is amazing to see the film made in late 50s and realize that this film has caused a stir all over the world, US included.  In the Midwest, this film was considered obscene and it is the Supreme Court that granted this movie not be equaled with pornography.  Made in black and white, this Malle's film is even more artistic in today's era.  Story is about a upper middle class married woman who lives in provinces (Dijon) with her newspaper editor husband.  She lives seemingly comfortable life in a large house, with full time nanny and servants.  Her husbands pays her very little or no attention, he is cold and emotionally unavailable.  They sleep in separate bedrooms.  To find some amusement, young wife Jeanne goes to Paris to visit her married childhood friend who mingles in high society.  It is there that she finds a lover, well-to-do polo player who she sees regularly until one day her husband decides to put a stop to her trips to Paris and have his wife's "friends" come a visit for the weekend.  He is determined to re-establish his dominion over his household and of course, his wife.  It is in preparation of this weekend, that Jeanne's car breaks down on the road and she gets a ride from the handsome, young stranger to her home.  As a token of gratitude, young man is invited for a supper and to spend a night in the house before he takes off to his destination the next day.  Frustrated that she cannot be with her lover, and outraged by her husband's possesive behavior, Jeanne wonders outside her bedroom at night, in the garden, where she and her mysterious savior find each other.  Before long, they realize strong attraction between them and make love in the garden and her bedroom.  Jeanne is sure she has found her soulmate and decides to leave everything behind: her young daughter Catherine, the big house, jewelry, clothes, everything.  In the dawn of the new day, as house guests are getting ready for the fishing trip, Jeanne and her lover leave house never to return again.  I do not believe that it is lovemaking scenes alone that made this film scandalous at the time.  This woman is almost like D.H. Lawrence's wife, who left her comfortable upper-middle class life of a wife and a mother for the big unknown with a much younger man.  All she is certain of is that she wants to be with a man she has met and there is no price to it.  She will sacrifice everything for her own happiness no matter how short, or long that happiness will last.  I have enjoyed watching interviews from a film director, actors and screenwriter and find film utterly beautiful and powerful, 50 years after it was made.  It is a film that celebrates woman's sexuality and her power to make her own choices.

$review_text.: AMAZON CUSTOMERS: Since I have been asked repeatedly by fellows here on Amazon, and I happen to know from the sellers of this edition - this DVD is in Spanish with English subtitles only
It is, I believe, a Mexican market release, but will play in NTSC Region 1 since it is designed that way
Well, from their lips to God's ears, because I'm not risking it even though Spanish is my native language!Be warned: the PAL version of this herePope Joan (Die P&auml;pstin) (La papessa) [Region 2] (2009), which is probably an Asian release (see my review), boasts English language but it is a PAL version
The "all region" part is misleading, because that will not play on ANY U.S


DVD player

It will only play on a PAL all-region player! A PAL all-region is not the same as an NTSC all-region player

Also be wary of what I believe is yet another PAL version that says it's all-region ..

please remember it has to be NTSC no matter how many regions it says it plays.This was filmed in English and even though it has terrible dubbing ("looping") probably because it was intended for multiple language releases, I want it IN ENGLISH!! And it isn't available that way!POPE JOAN (dir
S&ouml;nke Wortmann, 2009, in English) just aired on a channel called REELZ

My wife said we had to see it, since she's a big fan of the original novelPope Joan: A Novelby Donna Wollfolk Cross, on which this film is based

I was most anxious to see it too

It was deeply rewarding for us both

The closest thing to it is the compellingAgora


This film is nothing like any silly Joan of Arc story, so don't believe anyone who says it is.Do not confuse this with 2003'sPope Joan
In fact I see this film is all over the place and not really released in America properly


While I am reviewing the Latin American release (the only NTSC Region 1 release) I see the PAL version here:Pope Joan (2009) [Region 2],Pope Joan (2009) ( Die P&auml;pstin ) ( La papessa ) [ Blu-Ray, Reg.A/B/C Import - Netherlands]


You have been warned about getting anything in PAL since this is America.In brief, this is the imagined biography of 'Johanna von Ingelheim' (Johanna Wokalek), the German girl who was to become the mythical Pope John VIII (but there was an actual Pope John VIII so please be aware of that).Starting with her difficult birth, to her stealing her brother's identity in order to pass as a man, at the halfway mark it delves into the relative ease with which Johanna found herself elected pope

The great David Wenham is Count Gerold, who takes her in when she first goes to study
I love John Goodman as Pope Sergius, the man who gives Johanna her place of power and the final stepping stone to the papacy.The sets are lush, the locations stunning


This film really gives chills, because it is the Dark Ages, incarnated better than I have ever seen onscreen

Its realism and the attendant sadness is no mean feat for any director to realize

While thin on history, which I expected from a movie about 9th century Europe, it gives an impressionist taste of the whole thing


Even the crisis in the papacy, in which there was a new pope about every other year and some of the popes were brutes, is beautifully clear.The acting is what I sometimes call "quackting" (my term, do not steal it)
The actors are either green, nervous or simply got shot and printed on the very first take

That often happens with European film, and the fact that the whole soundtrack is voiced-over is little help


Even the charismatic and booming Goodman re-recorded all his lines, line-for-line
I know there are reasons for this (foreign market releases), but I hate it all the same.Most especially because this film was filmed in English and English is what they are meant to be speaking.The director knows how to frame a killer shot

The crowning of Johanna is awe-inspiring: the key shot is a majestic close-up, an idea taken directly fromThe Queen
In fact we talked about Wokalek's resemblance to Helen Mirren

Then there is the slowly rising bird's-eye shot of Pope Joan as she collapses and lay dying


I can honestly admit it made me weep.This is a fun, humorous and 'natural'-feeling film
Were it not so brutal at certain moments, I'd recommend it to the entire family
It is better than similar works such asThe Pillars of the Earth, which in my opinion had value but was overall drivel


There is no other Dark Ages film with which to compare this.It is light on Church details, compared to the heavy but excellentLutherfor example; it is light on world history too, so I have seen reviews of this referring to it as "Carolingian"

Close, but not quite: it's a little set in Germany and then in Rome, not in France


Mostly it's set in Rome, and I'm sorry but Rome was never Carolingian, Merovingian or any other kind of vingian.Still, this movie gives us all we need to know - almost all we can know - about that era

Anyone's guess, or myth, is as good as the next
This one is so good it is instructive and I almost dare to say comprehensive.The stunning old bishop who both introduces/epilogues the story - whom I mistook for Pope John VIII and I'm sure that was intended - looked fascinating
This actress' character, whose name I cannot discover, was apparently the anonymous compiler of the Medieval list of popes


She is meant to be not just a high-ranking bishop, but also to invoke man, woman, and from what I can tell, three different kinds of gay people ("100% gay" male, ditto female, and bi) plus POSSIBLY a transgendered person.Lovely! Quite the stunning accomplishment, it moved me deeply, and I wish there had been more about this real-life bishop - whom, it is said, placed Pope Joan back into the official list when the name had been ditched


However, if you can tolerate the Spanish and don't mind subtitles, you must see this

And yet, the buyer needs to ask whether it is worth it
I find that it is, but this galactically stupid strategy of NOT releasing this in the language it was filmed is unforgivable.

$REVIEW.: This film version of the wildly popular musical was very nearly scrapped, but the intervention of Francis Ford Coppola gave it a limited release on the big screen followed by the video release. Is it any good? Well, yes and no.The plot concerns the machinations of two next door neighbors who pretend to have a feud in the hopes that their children will fall in love (the lure forbidden fruit and all that). They enlist the help of a strange traveling circus to aid them in their plan. The first half of the movie is quite decent and somewhat sweet, and I enjoyed it very much. And then, for some reason, the movie completely derails, gets flat out bizarre (and earns its PG rating) before ending on a weird note.If you are a die-hard fan of the original musical you will probably hate this movie, because the music has been basically butchered. The performances range from good (Joel Grey) to lame (Joe McIntyre) to inexplicable (Vegas magician Teller). But then there is Jonathan Morris. I've never seen him in anything else, but he has an incredible, mesmerizing presence. The script changes his character completely halfway through the film, which is annoying, but his performance continues to stay with me, especially his gentle rendition of "Try to Remember" (which, despite being the most famous song in the musical, is given about one minute of screen time. Grrr.). He made the movie worth seeing (once) for me, but all others beware.It's really too bad; there was great potential here but the filmmakers muffed it. Maybe they'll try again someday, but until then you can check out the original Broadway soundtrack to see what all the fuss was about in the first place. I give this film version 2.5 stars, which I rounded down to two. Morris is really the only reason to catch this one.Movie Grade: C/C-

But this year, there's something more to worry about than hangovers and complaints from local old timers; A new type of terror is about to be cut loose on Lake Victoria. After a sudden underwater tremor sets free scores of the prehistoric man-eating fish, an unlikely group of strangers must band together to stop themselves from becoming fish food for the area's new razor-toothed residents.The cast led by Elisabeth Shue (as Julie Forester) & Adam Scott (as Novak) is great!

This is a great remake that is faithful to its original without taking away its spirit. Alexandre Aja has got another remake hit on his hands. This is one of the best horror movies in years and one of the best horror remakes in years.

$REVIEW.: Finally! After much time, and many installments in both the Nightmare on Elm St. and Friday the 13th series, the fued has come. Recent Jason films have been given more thought than the Freddy films which steadily lost steam around the third movie. This was the breath of life that Freddy needed (Although, I must admit, I am more of a Jason fan myself!) I this film we see Freddy return as more of a frightening slasher than a killer comedian. Initially, the humor failed to satisfy me as I felt Freddy should have been more of a silent killer such as Jason or Michael Myers. As his films became more comedy than scary, I lost interest. Jason, of course, after his trips to hell and to outerspace returns once again in his terrifying form. I was overall reletively pleased withi this film, the acting, the suspense, and the atmosphere. I give this film 4 stars, and highly recommend checking it out!

$REVIEW.: Great movie and superb acting. The aircraft used was unbelieveable. The instrumental. "Aces High" was the best modern march I have ever heard. It would have been very popular back in Germany during its time. In Europe it is also known as the "Luftwaffe March".But what happened to the rest of the movie?? There should have been atleast 20 minutes more as in the movie theaters when it first came out. Very dissaapointing especially when DVD companies seem to do this on a regular basis with movies.Keith T. Kalkanoff

$REVIEW.: Yes, I am a classic and modern day fan of the Disney Animated films. The concept of a live action version of one the most evil and menacingly drawn characters in history, such as Maleficent, was really something I was looking forward to. Walt Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Maleficent&#8221; fell short in many ways for me &#8211; but really shines for Angelina.Robert Stromberg held the reigns of directorship on this project and coming from a visual effects supervisor background, makes his directorial debut with this film. &#8220;Maleficent&#8221;, with the screenplay written by Linda Wolverton (Alice In Wonderland, Beauty and the Beast) from the original Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm brothers tales and loosely from the adaption of the original animated film by Erdman Penner (and six others)&#8211; is a film takes a very long start to get to the meat of the story and then rides fairly smoothly.Let me explain what I enjoyed most. Angelina Jolie (Changeling, Salt). Watching her as the innocent and caring fairy in the beginning and then her subtle but powerful glares, smirks and smiles she conveys evil and a heartwarming concern to such perfection that you cannot help but be engaged every moment she is on screen. She is beautiful and dark and inviting and terrifying all at the same time. Her range for the characters is sedate and strong yet so charge with life and energy you will find it very easy to relate to why she became the way she did.Elle Fanning (Super 8, We Bought A Zoo) plays Aurora with a soft but non-threatening demeanor. Almost as if she is not afraid of anything and unrealistically accepting of everything around her. If fact, the first third of the movie is her as a baby and growing up to be sixteen which overall, was very slow and dull &#8211; minus the wonderful visual effects of course.Sharlto Copley (Elysium, District 9) is playing Stefan. He is the reason Maleficent becomes who she is known as and why she seems to be bitter and angry toward everything. His performance is rather scattered as he fools Maleficent into thinking one thing with the goal of proving himself worthy of his dying fathers throne. Then he snaps and goes crazy apparently for no reason &#8211; it was just a strange switch in attitude for me to understand why he eventually does what he does.I did enjoy the three helpful fairies who were hysterical and played by Lesley Manville (Another Year, Secrets & Lies) as Flittle; Imelda Staunton (Harry Potter, Chicken Run) as Knotgrass and Juno Temple (The Dark Knight Rises, Atonement)  as Thistlewit. They have some Three-Stooges style of humor among them and it is funny and charming.Another nice performance came from Sam Riley (Control, On The Road) as Diaval who was once a black raven but is used as Maleficent&#8217;s eyes and ears when something happens to her. (No spoilers here!) Sam was smart with his reactions and honest with his expressions after having been rescued by her. He surprisingly teaches her a level of tolerance and patience. Sam and Angelina had great chemistry together on screen as well.Also, sweet, short and full of innocence, Brenton Thwaites (Oculus, The Signal) who plays Prince Phillip and is very heart-warming to watch. He and Elle look great together on screen, but unfortunately the screenplay didn&#8217;t give them much time together and when they were, it was rather non interactive and long drawn.I also enjoyed the amazing visuals. The creatures, both animal and plant were visually stunning and beautiful. Not many of them had a purpose it seemed or a function but they seemed to all live together well. This is a nice large scale movie and has some notable, if not very good, performances, but it just seemed to drag on in several places. &#8220;Maleficent&#8221; is really Angelina&#8217;s movie and I wish she was given more to do, but the finale with a dragon and a few other surprises does make it an interesting film &#8211; if you can wait that long to actually get there. Good for the whole family, but I don&#8217;t think everyone will come out enjoying it the same way or at the same level. Lorenzo of the [...] says you should go, if you don&#8217;t want to see anything else a little bit more. (Wink.)

After it had ended, I had known that it was pretty good, but I still felt like I had  missed something.  After just seeing it a second time on DVD, I can say  that I understand it a lot better.  I'm more of a fan of the first half  than the second half of the movie though because the first half was more  involving and thought-provoking in my opinion.  The acting by all is good  and the special effects are excellent.  The Matrix is not a classic, but it  no doubt is still quite cool.  Worth a watch.

It was tolerable, but I had difficulty with their speech

It is set in Ireland and they used local actors I assume? The acting was ok, no real complaints there


The movie was engaging, but some parts were just too off the wall and left me shaking my head


If it wasn't for the cow (you have to watch it to know what I mean), I think I may have liked it more
The ending left something to be desired
It was ok, for the price, you can't really go too negative.

$review_text.: *Yawn* Fairy tales again got skewered as, once upon a time, there was an inconsequential animated film titled HAPPILY N'EVER AFTER, which nipped like a famished chihuahua at the heels of the SHREK series and even of HOODWINKED. Unfortunately, this one's not even as passable as HOODWINKED.The plot: In Fairy Tale Land, high up in a castle, in the Department of Fairy Tales, a wizard carefully maintains the balance between good and evil, ensuring that all fairy tales continue to have their happy endings. But when the wizard goes on holiday, he leaves his all-important task to his two incompetent assistants, who naturally flub it. Cinderella's wicked but curvaceous stepmother (Sigourney Weaver) manages to gain control of the Department of Fairy Tales and swings the balance in favor of evil. Soon, the classic fairy tales begin to have their strange permutations. Thus, Sleeping Beauty never wakes up, Rumpelstiltskin collects the baby, and midnight arrives too soon for Cinderella. Speaking of Cinderella (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who is absent-mindedly referred to here as "Salmonella" and "Mozarella," it ultimately falls on her and her friend Rick (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), the lowly palace servant and Royal Flosser to Prince Charming, to save the day.I guess it's worth mentioning that the brave and clever Rick is in love with Cinderella, who, in turn, is in love with the simpleton, Prince Charming. I wonder how that turns out?There is such a thing as being too hip and flip, to the point where the story becomes undermined and the viewing audience stops caring. This is the sad case with HAPPILY N'EVER AFTER. Most of the voice actors try too hard or not hard enough, and there's an unpleasant influx of snideness and unwelcome contemporary in-jokes (unwelcome because they're unfunny). Certainly the two leads, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze, Jr. are unmemorable. The only performance worth noting here is Patrick Warburton's, who has a very good showing as the handsome dullard Prince Charming. Oh, and I guess  Michael McShane, who voices Rumpelstiltskin, has his moments. I did like that, as time went on, the baby reduces Rumpelstiltskin to a typically frenzied parental unit of sorts.The animation is adequate. The songs? Suck. The pace of the film lags in many spots and just plain fails to hold the interest of the viewer. The adult viewer, that is. Kids might enjoy it, although the more discerning tykes just might decide to put in a better flick (like SON OF THE MASK or BOLERO). Again, the film does a disservice to the audience by thinking itself too clever as it presents an aggravating plotline and a jaded and overdone sense of hipness. Ultimately, in my irritated opinion, HAPPILY N'EVER AFTER is strictly rental fare.

$REVIEW.: "The odds of this kid ending up on your doorstep...it's a sign."  Mike Flaherty's (Giamatti) law practice is failing.  Running out of money he decides to risk his practice by agreeing to become the guardian of a wealthy client.  When the clients grandson shows up to stay with him Mike takes him in and is amazed at his wrestling skills.  When his mom shows up the entire plan, and family, is thrown into turmoil.  This movie is very, very good.  The acting is excellent (with Giamatti that's kind of a given) and the writing is great.  The movie follows Mike and the decisions he makes that effect more then just him or his family.  Much like the movie "Gone Baby Gone" it deals with the scenario of if a kid is better living with a stranger then his own family.  At the same time this movie is very funny, moving and thought provoking and is a great choice to rent for the night.  The biggest problem that this movie has is that the family turmoil that is in this movie is overshadowed by "The Beaver" and the awesomeness of that movie.  Overall, a very, very good movie with great acting and heart. This movie will not dissapoint.Would I watch again? - I think I would.*Also try - Little Miss Sunshine & The Winning Season
$SUMMARY.: A great movie about what is right for kids that is filled with great acting and heart.  Giamatti is great as always. I say B+

What I like about this guy and this band is their open and sincere and high approach to music and culture and us as listeners (shows in how they relate to the audience and how they price this DVD).This recording is well if modestly done. Nothing flashy here, just 6 guys playing well together. I was a bit surprised to have the show start with a few short interviews introducing the band and their approach to the music. Then for the next 2+ hours we get the full uninterupted concert. And I loved the show! And I was also glad to have had the reminder of the intention behind it.I'm a big fan of Trucks but was more impressed by the rest of the band as well, the varied selection of tunes, the skill they played and interplayed with, and the general way they approach their task. As Trucks says in the intro these guys play as it is their church, and that includes us and the collective intention of the best the world has to offer.This is the way to approach music; from the sacred, with humility, playfulness, joy, inclusiveness, and the love of doing it right.

$REVIEW.: I would unreservedly rate Impromptu five out of five after two viewings, the reason being it's the most successful period drama I've watched that combines history and farce in a most effectively entertaining manner.Each of the main characters (practically everyone has a distinct voice) are imbued with nothing short of humour and definitive caricature - a steadfast George Sand, a neurotic Chopin, an irreverant Musset, a virile Delacroix, a hyperbolic, quietly intellectual and mild Liszt, a haughty, spiteful and duplicitous Marie D'Agoult and a hysterical Countess who has been so effectively parodied as the patron of minor talents but huge inheritance.As with countless of historical dramas, Impromptu has not been spared a degree of measurement with regards to historical accuracy
I feel that a certain dispense from the facts is acceptable, so far as they remain relevant, and conducive to the development of the story and in this case, the humour.Emma Thompson has proven time and again, her mastery of period drama and her multi-faceted talents.Judy Davis and Bernadette Peters are truly brilliant and entertaining in their convincing and riveting portrayals of Sand (whom you love to emphatize with) and D'Agoult (whom you love to hate), eventually placed at loggerheads.The DVD also comes with a French voice-over not found in many films of French background filmed in English

The dialogue is much more hilarious than the original in English! (especially with George Sand and Marie D'Agoult's parts)..


A boon for viewers who wish to improve on their non-native language.The soundtracks are strung together in a most admirable fashion, beginning most lightheartedly with Chopin's fleeting-paced but good-natured Impromptu in A flat, the theme of Sand's "romantic calling" in Chopin's first Ballade and the Fantasie-Impromptu near to the end of the film, which should be familiar to almost any viewer.Lush orchestrations have been "mixed" in certain parts with the original solo piano excerpts to enhance the dramatic flow


Musical purists need not be overly concerned with this mild cosmetic effect.Overall, it is a film I would recommend without hesitation to  lovers of classical music, historical drama and comedy.

$review_text.: When "Interview With A Vampire" was about to go into production, Anne Rice was right there, supervising and making her opinions known. Tom Cruise might never have played Lestat if she had had her way initially, which would have been tragic. However, in the end, not only was Rice pleased, but so were the rest of her fans.Where was Anne Rice when this fiasco went into production? For one, Lestat in this movie, played by someone who really doesn't matter, stunk. He lacked all of the finesse and style that Cruise put into the role, making Lestat a lackluster character in this feature.Aliyah turns out a suprisingly decent performance (her last), but she was never a strong enough actress to carry a movie and could not be expected to save this idiotic film.The characters we come to know and love in the books are completely compromised. Quite frankly, if they were going to consolidate and change so much of the original story, they should have just scrapped the project, or taken the time to do something more along the lines of "Lord of the Rings", splitting up the movies in order to make them more true to the books.This movie almost turned me off of the book, and I am sorry I ever watched it.

$review_text.: A lazy afternoon of fishing suddenly becomes a life and death struggle that will propel a governor to prominence and head a short list of vice presidential candidates to replace the one that just died
But the next surprise is the one who is actually given the nod, a senator from Ohio, Laine Hanson, played by Joan Allen.This triggers a visceral reaction from Republican Senator Shelly Runyon of Illinois, played by Gary Oldman, who wants to see the passed over candidate, Governor Jack Hathaway, played by William Petersen, get the nod instead of her


As the chairman of the confirmation committee, there is only one thing for him to do--destroy her
Along the way, he enlists the help of a junior Democrat Congressman, Reginald Webster, played by Christian Slater who opposes her nomination for more idealistic reasons

The hearings provide the drama, and the camera takes us to the president, the hearings, the investigation by the FBI, and back to the hearings again

This keeps the story moving at a decent pace, and builds the suspense.What makes this so good for me is that there are many scenes that I would be willing to see over again, but not all

After all, this is not "The Godfather." Should you see this, please go back to the beginning and note the governor's behavior and movement, and what the first woman in the story mouths to him.The acting is superb
Senator Runyon reveals a sinister character who has fallen somewhere in the past from the idealistic and moral person his wife married
She sees, with dismay, the change that he does not realize
He plays his part with precise timing, speaking, halting, looking, waiting, baiting, only lacking the accent so identifiable of his home state


Joan Allen is a master at showing a face of barely contained emotion and distress

Jeff Bridges, as President Jackson Evans, is a disarming character who doesn't appear easily vexed in spite of the revelations that come out in the hearings


He takes them in stride, as well as his slight disappointment being unable to catch his White House chefs off-guard or lacking the ingredients for a meal he requests

 His affability camouflages his caginess as he challenges once again the man he defeated in the presidential election, Shelly Runyon

A minor but thoroughly believable role was given to Kathryn Morris, playing Paige Willomina, a pony-tailed, cutsey, eye-glass-wearing, nerdy, almost ditzy FBI agent who is as sharp as a tack, and doesn't miss a word or nuance.The viewer might be unhappy that the noble characters are progressive or that Runyon and his minions are not
You can despise the character of Runyon, without concern for his political persuasion


You can admire Hanson without embracing what she stands for politically
That is the strength of this film


Nevertheless, the movie represents something that is not so far from present-day Washington on both sides of the aisle--putting partisan politics above the good of the country and winning at all costs


 Released in 2000, it might be a reflection of the White House and Congress of the last decade with some exaggeration, but ten years later, it might be a reality that no one thought would happen.Four stars because it will appeal to the political drama afficionado, but as I watched the feminine form on the love seat next to me drift in and out of consciousness, I was reminded that it might not be for all audiences, and she will probably get even by turning on "The Bachelor." That's a terrifying thought.This might be a story about democracy, but that doesn't mean it is practiced in this apartment.I vote, "aye" for "The Contender."

My children love puppies but I refuse to raise a puppy so when Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 came out - they enjoyed watching the Papi and Chloe's sweet puppies.Synposis: From the creators of Beverly Hills Chihuahua, everybody's favorite talking Chihuahuas are back in a comedy that's a pack of outrageous fun for the whole family. Puppy mayhem turns the lives of newlywed Chihuahua parents, Papi and Chloe, upside down when their playful puppies present onechallenge after another. But, when their human owners find themselves in trouble, the tiny pups will stop at nothing to save them--because in good times and hard times, the family always sticks together. Papi, Chloe and the puppies embark on a heroic adventure, proving once again that big heroes come in small packages.Bonus Features:DVD1. French & Spanish Tracks and Subtitles2.

Beverly Hills Chihuahua Challenge - interactive game show led by PapiMy Opinion: The movie started off with a wedding between Papi and Chloe but to be honest the beginning was really confusing with the focus mainly on best man and maid of honor.  After a few minutes, the dogs getting married was focused on.  Since my little ones would be the one watching this movie, I was not overly thrilled with the dress of the adults but their attire was normal wedding apparel.Then the puppies are born...these five little puppies are absolutely adorable.  I just love when all 5 puppies sliding down in the mud and Chloe comes out to admonish them.  She tells all 5 puppies how their father will hear about this and he will not be happy.  As she is stating this, Papi shows up the top of the slide, yelling loud,  encouraging his young ones to have fun, slides right into the mud splashing Chloe as well.Throughout the movie, Papi and Chloe learn how to be parents.  Papi must learn to properly train his children and to be a proper parent; whereas, Chloe has to learn to let up from time to time and have fun.  All throughout the movie, you see fun puppy antics.  This movie is definitely geared toward children and as an adult I had a hard time sitting through the whole movie.This movie has no swearing, a little bit of adult humor, and is definitely geared for children.

$review_text.: I was reminded of this little comedy through something I had read and recently obtained it for family viewing. Although very dated it is an amusing work in the great British tradition of fighting bureaucracy and government in general and poking fun at ourselves too.There are a few barriers to overcome first, for instance, living in the land of the plenty and instant gratification, as I currently do, it is hard to explain the concept of wartime rationing to children, or why it was that everyone flocked to Pimlico once there was the realisation that the normal rules no longer applied, to sell things. Similarly my children were horrified by the fishmonger wrapping up a fish in newspaper. They were even more so when I told them it was the only way to eat fish and chips (by which I mean fries).But anyway, on with the tale. This is an engaging tale of ordinary folks fighting for their rights and treasure against the Whitehall bureaucracy (the man in Whitehall knows best). By accidentally exploding a leftover bomb from the blitz, some children enable a treasure trove to be found which includes a lost document declaring Pimlico to be a fiefdom of the Duke of Burgundy. This in itself brought a wry smile. Parts of London, really a part of France. Funnily enough I had read earlier of the news that the 2007 Tour de France is to start in London! The plot proceeds in a series of moves and counter moves, each yielding some small victory to one side or another until at last one skirmish seems to have settled the game for the Freedom Fighters when the same victory appears to bring utter defeat. Just as they are about to concede, the great British public steps in to help the underdogs which even stretches to airlifts of milk, a comment no doubt on the Berlin airlift. Finally, in another great British tradition, a compromise is reached and they all live happily ever after.There is a great deal of social commentary in this movie about the very slow end to rationing after the Second World War had ended and how resilient the British people were. The enemy were no longer the French or the Germans but our own civil servants. Many would consider things to be no different today. There is a relatively brief appearance by Margaret Rutherford, better know for her Miss Marple role, who enlivens the proceedings. All in all an interesting and amusing movie where things were much more simple and relatively quick action could achieve so much as opposed to endless chattering in committees and boards which has become the hallmark of modern industrial societies.On to more Ealing comedies...the Carry On series beckons...

$REVIEW.: There can be no denying that the ethereal other-worldniness of this astounding fantasy series has been captured so wonderfully on film.This seemingly unsurmountable task has actually been overcome! The characters could not have been better chosen, especially those chosen for Gandalf, Boromir, Frodo, and...let's face it, there was not a bad choice there!Of course, the film does translate better if you had actually read the books

However, my wife (who has never read the books) was completely enthralled and asked me questions about several aspects of the film
Yes, the film does not answer all, but her enthusiasm and interest had been completely captured by the wonderment of story, character, setting, and drama

This film lacks NOTHING in these departments.Oh, and one special note


For the review stating something akin to "Tolkein is rolling in his grave," I just wanted to note that I have actually met his daughter, Priscilla Tolkein

I, for one, can attest to J.R.R

Tolkein's love for his story and to the ones that he told it to

In all fairness, I never have met J.R.R
and cannot comment on his possible reaction to a rendering of his work, but I can say this in defense of his family: could we please have a little more tasteful respect for the dead? Enjoy this film for the adventure that it is and stop putting words in other people's mouths.There are some frightening moments for kids, but I believe it will be a joy for those who have read the books.Two Towers...here we come!!!

I will buy the Amazon dvd with the extras for the simple reason that the movie isso good, so much fun to watch, so well done, that I'm interested in and want to watch the extras, as well as own the movie.Now, if you are looking for the biggest boobs, the most death, mind blowing special effects and various other contemporarycome ons, look not here.But, the visuals, the acting, the dialogue, all the ingredients of film art, those are here.It will draw you in, you will care about the characters-even as you wonder what exactly they are made of-and you will lamentand rejoice at their losses and successes.What could be cliche', easily, in many movies, is not. Watch the police for an example of that, but there's more.It cruises right past those things leaving them as they are, or as they would be to the people experiencing the situationsand characters that act upon our three.. shall we call them heroes? Yeah, I think so.Man.. I hate to post this, because I'm not a critic, not an expert, and I'm being a lot more wordy than I like.. and I hope not to putanyone off.This is not an 'art' film, --god, am I gonna say per se????--it's just art. It's not something you have to discuss for an hour, orsomething that only 'true lovers of' can understand or appreciate.3.00 for crying out loud.. 3 lousy bucks and you'll tell your friends.It's like one of the many paragraphs of a Kurt Vonnegut novel-the ones you have to resist calling your friends on the phone and reading to them.

$review_text.: Oh wait, did I enjoy the first one? I didn't think much of it that's for certain. And along with this one, they're both alright. Not excellent. Not really, really bad either. Having heard this was better than the first, and the CGI was better, I went off to see it. Now lets face it, I could have seen many other films, among them Catwoman, or King Arthur (although it's done by Jerry Bruckheimer, who did Pirates of the Caribbean, and since that was utter clap-trap, I've kinda gone off the idea of begging around to see who would chum me)To start with, I was very unimpressed by the credits, which are highlights from the first Spiderman. It was Sam Raimi trying to be smart, and it fell flat with me. Very artistic to look at, but I want to see a film, not a bunch of people's names. If you're interested in seeing that, you watch it at the end of the movie!The CGI was loads better than the first, which had an almost computer game quality to it. Some shots were still a little iffy, but if you're watching for that, then you should really get a life.I'm still not keen on the casting of this. Tobey MacGuire does nothing for me. The faces he kept pulling, especially when he was exerting himself, were just downright ugly, and he looks too much like the eager boy in class, who knew the answers to every question. Kirsten Dunst can be reasonable, but her hair colour seemed to change continuously, and from what I've seen *ahem* I thought she was a vivacious red head. Not a whiny, practically blonde, oh-I-like-two-guys-I-can't-decide-which-one little girl.I preferred Doc Ock to the Green Goblin from the first. Dr. Otto Octavious was just a man who loved his wife very much - his face says it all when his wife gets killed, partly by him. He was just a little too into his work at times.I found this movie to be extremely tedious, and even if I looked away, and then looked back, I hadn't missed anything important. There seemed to be too much talking, and too little action, which I seem to find a common problem in these movies. The only bit of excitement I had was when my Dad whispered in my ear that Bruce Campbell was on the screen, and I leapt out of my seat - but by that time he'd gone off the screen. (He's credited as playing the "snooty usher".)This would have got a much lower rating if it hadn't been for the ending, cos I was about ready to give up all hope of ever getting out of there alive. The ending is really spectacular, and therefore, upped my rating of the movie. It's amazing on the big screen, and Mary Jane features pretty big in the finale - come on, you're all rooting for her to decide on the right person. But you don't do it in your wedding dress or with a very big engagement ring on your finger darling! There are also a lot of hints about a Spiderman 3, so watch carefully. I'm reckoning the next one could go two ways. Two possible bad guys? Maybe not, cos it could rehash this one. But then the other one could rehash the first one. Oh heck, I'm confusing myself now.Another thing I didn't like was Spiderman taking his mask off, excuse me, but what the heck was the point?! It just didn't ring true. Of course, MJ sees him without his mask on, and suddenly realises she knew it was him all along. Yes dear, whatever dear.Despite not liking (hate is too strong a word) most of this film, I did enjoy the ending, and it will be interesting to see what they do with the third, without rehashing the first two. And a note to Sam Raimi: please transform Bruce Campbell back to the way he looked in the Evil Dead movies - I'll definitely notice him on screen that way!

$REVIEW.: Viewed: 11/13Rate: 911/13: This is Mickey Rourke at the top of his game in Barfly. If there is any doubt about his acting ability, it can be laid to rest by seeing this one along with his other brilliant performances during the 80's in Rumble Fish, 9  Weeks, Angel Heart, Year of the Dragon, Johnny Handsome, and Wild Orchid (sorry, I am not too much of a fan of The Pope of Greenwich Village). Mickey Rourke steals the show from start to finish in Barfly and is able to outshine Faye Dunaway in every scene who is a highly respectable actress. What helps the film the most is the writing by Charles Bukowski to make the cynosure alcoholic a tolerable character because films like The Lost Weekend and Leaving Las Vegas fall apart since they feature uninteresting, unsympathetic drunks. There is plenty of character in Mickey Rourke's drunk, and he seems to view life through a different looking-glass. If one would look at Mickey Rourke in other films in terms of how he acts, walks, and behaves, there is a dramatic transformation in all aspects in Barfly. Hence, it is a shock he went from John in 9  Weeks to Henry in Barfly one year later. That's why Barfly may as well be the best work Mickey Rourke has ever done in his career although his John of 9  Weeks and Randy the Ram of The Wrestler are of worthy mention. All in all, Mickey Rourke shows in Barfly why he is almost in the same class as Marlon Brando.

Finally in May of 2010 it prospered and continued on with honors! I was going around and telling my friends and family about it. Trying to keep the sales strong and luckily it did for the 6th and final season came out in April of 2011. Almost a year after it's 5th season release. This is the kind of respect that I hope I can see for "The Wayans Bros.", "Murphy Brown" "The Jamie Foxx Show" etc real soon. But bottom line "Fresh Prince" is a great classic show. Will Smith is the man.

$review_text.: I see a lot of five star reviews for this film, and I wonder if you have to be a fan of horror movies to appreciate this movie fully. I will say that is not nearly as "twisted" or "original" as some reviews have stated' in my opinion. It sticks pretty close to most cabin in the woods plot lines, but it also tries to explain the genre as well. It is here the movie falls WAY short of being a five star classic, for every "answer" the film provides there are ten more questions raised. Also for the people who dont want to give anything away or cant stand spoilers, the movie breaks its own fourth wall about ten mins in. This is a fun movie and I think can be enjoyed by horror fans and film fans alike, but it's no Evil Dead. I mean what makes a horror movie great is what a good director can do with limited resources, that is not happening in a multi million dollar A list movie  soooo some of the fun is missing and the filmmakers here do seem to think they are very clever, and maybe they are but Raimi, Carpenter, and tobe hooper have all made better horror movies for less money and with more feeling.  Update 01/14. Have re watched this film many times, and it gets better with each reviewing! I must give the film maker credit, he does add many fresh details to an old story, and there is enough of a twist that you feel rewarded after further viewings. If you have seen it once and thought it was ok to good, I highly recommend watching it again.  very Solid Cast, all around!!!!

So much has already been written about Miss Taylor's performance  that I'll just say this, it is her greatest performance and certainly one of the greatest performances of all time. Mr. Burton is heartbreaking as her down trodden husband and deserved the Oscar. George Segal! ah, he really could act, once upon a time! Sandy Dennis! She broke my heart in this one!

$REVIEW.: As soon as a movie starts, I start thinking about how I'm going to review it. For the first 40 minutes, I thought I was going to throw this movie in the gutter where it belonged when I reviewed it, because for all that time there's practically nothing but revolting Nazi crap. It's very, very hard to sit through. The first scene is the violent beating of a cruising gay man by a skinhead who had come on to him and told him how beautiful he was before calling out his gang to beat and kick the guy to a pulp (an incident that re-enters the story significantly near the end).After that are long scenes of the ugly Nazis (the men are physically as well as morally ugly) spewing their toxic garbage into my ears where it was not welcome. But then... ah, then... at about the 41-minute mark, Lars and Jimmy start looking at each other in a new way, and EVERYTHING changes. The first 40 minutes of hateful garbage are well worth suffering through to get to that exquisite tenderness and passion.Thure Lindhardt as Lars is a gentle, enormously attractive beauty from his first scene to his last, but the character is pretty flat: steady and strong but not very interesting. David Dencik got the meaty role in Jimmy, and he pulls it off brilliantly. He is completely believable both as the bitter, arrogant, brutal Nazi homophobe and as the sweet, gentle, deeply vulnerable and passionate man who eventually emerges from that hateful shell. If the first third of the movie had not been so revolting, Jimmy's emergence from that horrible world would not have been so marvelous. And it IS marvelous, some of the loveliest acting I have ever seen.Raw, naked, totally defenseless vulnerability is something rarely seen in movies, particularly from male actors. In fact the ONLY previous example that comes to mind is Jane Fonda fairly early in her career - inKluteand even more powerfully earlier inThey Shoot Horses, Don't They?Fonda, in both those roles, had been beaten down by a cruel system she was helpless against; but Dencik is breaking out - against his own will - from within an even more brutal system in which he has been on top and on which he has been completely dependent for his identity.He discovers that he's just like the guys he's been attacking, and that discovery shatters him. It shatters him, but it finally begins to set him free to be himself for the first time. It's a very great performance that makes an otherwise mediocre movie (deeply offensive when it's not simply unbelievable) well worth watching. The transformation just in his eyes is astonishing. All four stars are for him.

Originally titled "The Brave Young Men Of Weinberg", MAD magazine entered the picture early on and bought the rights and titled it "MAD Magazine Presents...Up The Academy".  This movie was filmed in Salina, Kansas at an actual boys military academy and I was an extra, in the bleacher shots during the soccer scenes.  I met Ralph Macchio, and this was his first movie, and he was quite excited about it.  He was discovered tap dancing in a laundromat....  true story.  This explains the no-reason scene of him tap dancing in the barracks on his way out of the room. Anyway, he went on to be the new cast member (a rebellious teen character) on EIGHT IS ENOUGH, before taking off in films like KARATE KID, etc.  I still have the copy of the check I was paid for my 3 weeks as a stand-in/extra.  Ahhh, those teenage memories,lol.  True, this movie would never have won any awards, but sometimes teenage movies are made for teenage minds.  And this is one of them.

$review_text.: This film came highly recommended so I checked with our local library to see if they had it and, lo!, they did..with one catch: There was a waiting list of 35 (unprecedented in my experience) waiting to get it


I added my name; months later I got an email saying my turn had come

I approached the movie with high anticipation considering its simultaneous popularity and (to me) obscurity.I have to say I was very disappointed

None of the movie rang true except perhaps the most basic of premises, i.e

a bunch of underdog students trying to better themselves.The friendships between the "boys" did not seem real, nor did the student/teacher relationships, or, for that matter, the teacher/teacher relationships
The frank sexual interactions between the faculty and the students was not convincing, either, neither in the way it was portrayed nor in the way it was dealt with by the other faculty/students once "discovered." It seemed more like wish fulfillment-and disturbing wish-fulfillment, at that--on the part of the playwright/screenwriter.Melodramatic, theatrical (in the bad sense of the word), forced...these are the words that come to mind to describe it

Fortunately, they assembled an excellent cast, the film's most redeeming quality


If they'd had better material to work with, it could have been an excellent film.

$review_text.: When i first came to notice this I thought this film was a chick flick. I'm a guy and I don't really care that much about family-oriented films, but I got to say this is GOOD! There I said it. I saw this filme with my mom and we enjoyed it. The basic plotline of this remake of the original has Mom(Jamie Lee Curtis) and daughter switching bodies for a day. Mom is hard-working and quick-witted woman and her daughter is a rebellious and uptight girl who plays in a rock band. Same plot as the original, but different backgrounds for the characters. It works well. I liked the psychical work from the characters. Curtis, from the body of the teenager, dresses hip in order to in with the crowd and the daughter's crush is falling for her! Curtis and the young actress Linsay Lohan give heartwarming performances and make the believibility of a real life mother and daughter seem real. The only slight negative thing about this film is the subplot of the fortune cookie being the basis of the mom and daughter's switch. Otherwise the film is a standout.

$review_text.: I first saw this movie at Best Buy's Magnolia
They used it to show the 5.1 surround effects of the scene of the "Drum Dance" in the begining of the movie.Well, the audio quality is now amazing (5.1 uncompressed), and the video quality - WOW!!! - The movie shows as good as it sounds
Beautiful cinematography, amazing colors, brilliant scenery, very detailed constructions, wardrobe
It is a delight to watch.It is a feast for the eyes and ears
Indispensable to show off the capabilities of your Blu-Ray equipment and your Audio equipment

Plus, it's a great story, worth watching over and over.

$review_text.: This is one of the finest crime dramas of recent years
Harkening back to another great film, 1971's Get Carter, Terrance Stamp plays an ex-con, Wilson, who has comes to America to discover the causes of his daughter's death

I found this a great film for many reasons:Steven Soderbergh's direction was fascinating
He plays with time and images in a very interesting way, mixing up sharp close ups and long shots done out of time (some in flashback, some looking into the future)
While this smacks hard of arty/indi filmmaking, I think with this film it really worked to tremendous advantage
There are several shots of Terrance Stamp in extreme close-up, focusing on his strange, pale blue eyes, while sun and shadow play across his face

I found these shots oddly moving, and after a second viewing I figured out why: in these shots the sunlight passes over his face like the rising and falling of the sun - like the passing of time


Soderbergh's direction is very tight throughout, and his shot selection is always excellent.I love the casting of this movie

Terrance Stamp could not have been better, cast as Wilson, the cockney career criminal that has come to the plastic world of California looking for some very hard answers
His Wilson is a once-in-a-career creation, much like Clint Eastwood's, William Munny from The Unforgiven
Stamp really makes Wilson jump right off the screen in every scene he is in

Several good to great actors find their finest moments on film here, always playing against type
For once Lesley Ann Warren is NOT a bubble-headed sex starved vixen, but instead a woman with depth and intelligence

For once Luiz Guzman is NOT a slightly comic, second banana bad-guy Hispanic but instead a decent, complex man that proves his metal during the course of the film.Peter Fonda plays a music mogul named Valentine with a heart of corruption beyond his melancholy reminisces of the 60's (who, in an offhand moment, explains the 60's perfectly in about 5 or 6 lines of dialogue)
Barry Newman seems to come out of nowhere with a pitch perfect performance as a suave head of security for the Valentine empire.Finally, watch for the two-man hit team of Nicky Katt and Joe Dallesandro, who are hired to kill Stamp


Nicky Katt gives a real, real creepy performance, nearly worth the price of admission by itself, and it was just great to see Dallesandro mixing it up again (Dallesandro comes out of the Andy Warhol factory and was Warhol's beefcake boy in several of his movies).All in all, a film that will easily stand up to repeat viewings.This is one you should have in your collection.

$review_text.: This was one of the first films I ever saw and parts of it stuck in my imagination for 43 years

 So, sitting down with my kids, I was very curious as to how I wd find it


 In a nutshell, it is great.But the most rewarding thing was how much my kids loved it, in particular my son
 At 6, the whole story to him was fascinating and got him to ask me all sorts of questions, like, why are the Lilliputians arguning about such silly things and why are the giants so dumb?  That is exactly what Swift was hoping to do with this tale, which espouses many of the theories (rationality, the uses of science in human society, etc.) that were becoming popular with the enlightenment
 What a delight to discuss these issues with my kids!!  THen there are the characters, such as Gulliver's naivte, which leads to some life-threatening situations
 Finally, there are the wonderful special effects - Harryhausen had a certain genius for his time - which are crude by today's standards by still enthralling.Warmly recommended for the entire family


 (Note:  I got this as part of the 5-film package deal of Harryhausen films, which cost just 1/3 more than this stand-alone version and lacks the documentaries, which I don't think are worth the difference in price.)

$REVIEW.: The stories of the 99th and the 332nd, the Tuskegee Airmen, are ones that should be heard by all Americans. As the subtitle states, they did fight two wars. They fought against the Nazis and they fought the civil rights war here at home.This is a well done documentary that presents the story of the Tuskegee Airmen. Topics examined include the prewar state of affairs of black servicemen, their training in Tuskegee, Alabama, their air campaigns in North Africa and Europe and their less than triumphant return home after the war. At each step of the way, they had to fight individual and institutional racism and they did so in the best possible manner. They fought bigotry with sheer excellence. They remain the only fighter group never to have lost one of the bombers they were charged with protecting to enemy fire.Participating in this documentary are some of the original airmen and their poignant recolections and anecdotes bring a very human face to go with their legendary exploits. These people include both pilots and the aircrews who kept them in the air. Ossie Davis provides narration and does a commendable job.This documentary should be of interest to people interested in military history. It should also appeal to those concerned with the civil rights struggle. More than either of these, it should appeal to anyone who wants to see a true profile in courage.

$review_text.: I'll just start off by saying this is the worst Vince Vaughn comedy I've seen. Not that I'm trying to put it all on him, because I think the writing and directing were probably the culprits, but I made an effort to see this film because he's one of my favorite comedy actors and has played some great roles. But this movie is more than forgettable, it just ain't funny! I thought the movie tried too hard to be visually funny rather than delivering funny lines per say and for me it just didn't work. Sure there were a couple of chuckles here and there, but basically the movie was very flat and sappy at times as well.Final Grade: C-

$review_text.: I adore this movie, flaws and all.  Yes, there are errors in the plot sequence and the filming.  Yes, there are obvious cheesy characteristics that don't seem to belong in a Coppola film; however, this is an endearing film that I have watched many, many times.  It never gets old for me.The retro styling of this film is just part of the draw.  I also love the undertones of the film's theme:  what if?  I think most people look back at all of our stupid adolescent mistakes and wonder what would happen if we could go back and relive it.  Peggy Sue gets the chance, and finds that the choices that she originally made were not necessarily bad ones.  She and Charlie were drawn each other as teenagers, and even when she relives her high school years, she finds that the same is true.  She knows that he's flawed, and she also knows what the future will hold for them, but she couldn't deny that at that point in time, they were drawn toward each other for a reason.Do things happen for a reason?  If Charlie would have sung a Beatles song, would it have been as popular?  Peggy Sue tried to alter some of the aspects of her life, but she also seemed to find that she was powerless to alter the major parts.  She could chase the "hip thinking" poet, but could she truly be happy with him?  Could she walk away from Charlie and find happiness with someone else, thus altering what she knew to be her future?The plot is a bit hokey, but it does get you thinking.  If you did get a chance, would it really be all that different?  On one hand, you want to say yes, while on the other hand, we all know that time distorts our perception of things.  Would we really do it all differently if given the chance?  Perhaps not.  It maybe for this question alone that you'd want to watch this film with good friends and ponder that question.

Yet people rushed to the cinemas to watch and hate this film because of the man.  This film is  excellent.  Nicely written and acted by all.  One of the few films made  these days where the effects serve the story and not the other way round.  So, if you don't like Keanu, don't see the film and spare us the  complaints.

The film fits into almost every suspense  cliche I can think of;  the most prominant being the stale story of the pretty girl who marries the fat,unattractive man for his money, then finds a young stud who helps plot and execute his murder.The twists are tired and easy to predict, and while the camera work is skilled & occasionally quite fun to watch, it doesn't make up for the plodding storyline and silly theatrics.And could someone please tell me why everyone is speaking in French except for Rod Steiger, whose mouth is moving over words in English, yet dubbed and subtittled in French?If you're looking for quality suspense, keep looking.

$REVIEW.: This film started out great and it looks great. If it only had a plot or gave some hint of why a big triangle rock in space would want to kill all the humans on planet Earth. Why would Morgan Freeman and a band of rebels dress up like the Predator? Because the space rock in the sky sent out droids to kill humans and Scavs. Why wear the sweaty helmet? The clone thing was odd. So, Jack and his copilot on the space mission let the passengers escape when they flew into the big space rock. They must have been the only ones ever to make it because the space rock cloned them. Then sent them out to find downed droids on planet Earth. This movie is pretty to look at but, it left me with a lot of questions. If one clone gets blown up am I really happy another clone comes back? Jack loses his copilot/dispatcher for droid repair but finds his wife from his Earth life. He moves on rather quickly. Then she returns the favor by going through the original Jack, one clone, and another clone at the end. Kinda crazy.

$review_text.: This is an above average cop drama. In addition to the typical murder plot and good guy vs bad guy theme, the primary focus is on the intense and tumultuous relationships between a few finely developed characters.The guilt, regret and heartache of DeNiro's character do not allow him or the film to be be humorous however a few scenes generate an unexpected laugh. This film is virtually all drama. The relationship of Deniro's character with that of McDormand's and Franco's, richly illustrate man's ability to confront all of the grief and anguish of his past. Robert DeNiro, Frances McDormand and James Franco are all excellent in their acting.Because the relationships are so intense and the characters so richly developed, you can't help but to empathize with every one of them. The twists and turns in the plot make you wonder how much DeNiro's emotionally closed off character can handle before something changes. This movie makes you sit with the discomfort of each of its characters.City By The Sea was filmed in the decayed ruins of the shore town and boardwalk of Asbury Park NJ. The Atlantic Ocean and the dilapidated remains of the boardwalk and vacant buildings provide an excellent urban yet coastal set for this story which takes place in the seaside NY town of Long Beach just outside NYC. There are also a few excellent and vivid images of the Twin Towers in this film which only add to the emotional experience by reigniting more feelings of anguish and loss. The Dolby Digital background sound effect of the ocean surf in a few scenes adds a sense of tranquility to this drama.Although the movie includes the typical shooting and violence scenes, this cop drama is more about real relationships.

$REVIEW.: The first impression of the film from DVD was everyone looks ugly, aged and worn out.It was partly due to the 70' look and the lighting by the cinematographer.As the movie proceeds, I kept on expecting something moving, meaningful and rewarding.Is it a biopic? a social satire? a comedy? a drama?Or all of the above?I endured to the end and I was angry.Why would Taylor Hackford made this film and asked his talented wife to take this role?Any time a husband/wife team get involved in making a film takes an unnecessary risk toundermine the value of the film.It is not even a good soap opera.  The storyline is pedestrian.  The characterization is superficial.Helen Mirren was miscast.  The love scenes between her and the young boxer were uncomfortableto watch and unconvincing.  The boxer with a steel plate in his head and could go on with 4 roundsof fight is ridiculous, not to mention his miraculous recovery from ICU overnight.Joe Pesci made good effort, although he can only play a variation of his character for every moviehe's in.A very disappointing viewing experience.

$REVIEW.: Riccardo Muti returns to the Berliner Philharmoniker after 17 years with this live recording of the Europe Concert 2009 at the beautiful Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. The concert is captured in very good sound (hardly compressed) and film. Verdi's blockbuster La forza del destino overture is presented with aplomb and finesse. I had not heard Martucci's song cycle La canzone dei ricordi before, but it is a gem to be explored further. Soprano Violeta Urmana performs these delicate late-romantic pieces poignantly and shines out within the expert support of the Berliners. I find Schubert's "Great" Symphony in C major the concert's high point. The work is long and somewhat repetitive, and it can badly drag in the wrong hands. I listened spellbound with a smile from the first bar to the last and marveled at the sensitive, inspired and strong reading. Muti often steps back and seemingly lets the Berliners play on their own accord. This is touching to watch, as he is apparently not in good health and, at the same time, living down his reputation as a severe taskmaster. A winner.

$review_text.: The original Battlestar Galactica is very nostalgic to those of us who grew up during the late 1970's. It is still special watching it over again, despite some of its cheesy parts. The great chemistry of the cast, well developed characters, and religious and mythological themes bring universal appeal to viewers of this series. It is full of hope, some episodes have great twists, and the acting is great and convincing.The Highlights: (ones not focused on by other reviewers)-The emotional struggle Lorne Green, Richard Hatch, and Dirk Benedict portray brings depth to a story of a people that see their civilization destroyed.-by watching each episode one after the other in their proper order, you can enjoy the proper chronology of the voyages of the Galactica (as opposed to seeing bits of it during Galactica marathons on cable).-family friendly characters and storylines (unlike the new, adulterated remake!)-Hatch (Apollo), Benedict (Face--er, Starbuck!), and Jefferson's (Boomer) commentary of the pilot episode.-Interviews with these three and other cast members (I can't believe that the guy who played Boxey is over 30. Yikes, I'm aging!)-The last episode is NOT the stupid one where there's this five year old professor, where Lorne Green has a Santa beard, and where Apollo and Starbuck are replaced by two look-alikes that are rot-gut actors! Thank "The Lords of Cobal" that this series ends with Apollo and Starbuck making a daring infiltration of a cylon base ship!The Negative Side:-Anyone who grew up watching sci-fi shows with CGI graphics will be disappointed by the dated special effects of this series. REMEMBER: Galactica's special effects were as high tech back then as the original Star Wars. John Dykstra worked on both Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica.-Speaking of special effects, how many times must the same Cylon fighter get blown up on the right corner of the TV screen? It get's annoying sometimes!!!! Knowing that each episode cost about a million bucks (lots of money back then) I don't blame the producers too much.-When I see the "space-aged" dancers and hear their retro disco music during some Galactica episodes, I CRINGE! How did pop-culture survive the era of poofy hair?-Those Triad (a game that's part volleyball, part indoor soccer) uniforms are HIDEOUS! If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch the episode "Murder on the Rising Star."This one-season show made a huge impact on millions because of the universal themes and fun characters. The stories are exciting and creative. After all these decades the original Battlestar Galactica still has got the magic.

$REVIEW.: Do not waste your money renting this pathetic excuse for a movie. My husband loves special effects and CGI, so even though rottentomatoes.com rates this movie poorly, we rented it. Big mistake. The acting is wooden. The script is contrived. The direction is nightmarish. The story plods along as if it's moving through a thick fog. I fell asleep a couple of times and finally quit watching halfway through. My husband watched the second half of the movie the next night, hoping it would get better (hello?), and I could tell from the next room, just listening to bits and pieces of the dialogue, that it only got worse. He agreed. Seriously. This movie is one of the worst I've seen in a long, long time.

$REVIEW.: This review refers to the sub version, for my dub review look at theNeon Genesis Evangelion - Perfect Collection.After seeing Eva for the first time about four months ago, I wrote a review and gave the series three stars, stating many reasons why it was and wasn't good (you can still read that review for the Perfect Collection). The review for the most part was quite neutral, but I received many comments asking me to give it another chance and watch in Japanese instead of in English. Eventually I caved, and now I'm glad I did. Although the series still suffers from some glaring flaws IMO, it is a whole lot better and easier watching it with the subtitles on than with the dubbing. The characters are presented much better and the acting is spot on. I didn't feel like strangling the main character every five seconds like I did with the dub and that in itself made the series better.---THE GOOD---The Characters in the sub are WAY better than their dub counterparts. In the dub I wanted to strangle the characters, or throw them off the cliff in annoyance and disdain. Shinji was just such a wimp I felt absolutely no sympathy for him and actually rooted on his demise (which never came). Misato was nothing but a slut, Auska a loud mouth brat, and Rei a pent up introvert.Although the characters in the sub are, on the surface, more or less the same, the way they are presented is completely different. Shinji, although still a cowardly weakling, take a dramatic change after the first volume and starts to open up to the people around him for the majority of the show. from volume 2 on to volume 6, his character is somewhat likable in the way that he starts competing with the others and relates to them as a normal human being would. In volume one, he's completely unlikable, and then slowly changes into someone who the viewer can have an easier time relating to.Rei is just the same in the dub and the sub alike. Her character is still a pent up introvert who refuses to open up. Really, she is one of the glaring flaws in this anime series. Her character never gets much attention at all, which is a shame because she could have been a very interesting character. She shows some signs of opening up in volume two, but after that all attempts at establishing her character are dropped. She exists in the background for the rest of the show, never doing or saying much of anything.At the same time, upon second viewing, the mech battles aren't nearly as bad as I remember them being. Although there is still a problem with repetition, the problem isn't as annoying as it was when I first saw it. There was considerably less yelling in the sub version which made the otherwise cheesy battles quite tense. In the dub, everything seemed centered on the angel battles, but in the sub version, the angels are more of a back-story, a side show to the characters story.Overall, almost nothing in the sub was quite as bad as it was in the dub version. The battles were better, the characters were better, and the overall mood of the series was better.---The Bad---At the same time, parts I remember as amazing were quite as good in the sub as they were in the dub. While watching the English version I remember volumes 6 and 7 being among the best episodes I've ever seen in anime, but when I watched them again, they didn't hold the same power they did when I first watched them. Auska's, Misato's, and Shinji's decent into depression all seemed to happen all at once. One episode everything's pretty much okay, the next everyone's thinking about suicide. I understand why everyone gets depressed, they all have their reasons and they are all understandable, but it didn't quite have the same power as it did in the dub. for other shows, likeNow and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set), the drama was always better in Japanese, but here it seems that just for certain parts, the dub version holds more power.Also, the ending, although a little better the second time around, is still a piece of garbage that should never have aired on TV. It seems the creator of this show though we couldn't figure out why the characters were depressed by ourselves so he created episode 25 to spell it out in minute detail and cover every single little thought they had. Was this really necessary? I already know why they all hate themselves; episode 25 is just throwing every ounce of subtlety away and spelling everything out for us in a really long and boring way. the music doesn't help out any, driving the viewer more towards sleep than interest, and the animation is, for the most part, just some character sitting in a dark room while his/her younger self talks to them in a monotone voice.Episode 26 is a little better, but not by much. If you like hearing people talk to themselves, than maybe you'll like this, but otherwise this episode will have you falling asleep. The whole episode is just psycho babble, Shinji telling us (again) that he hates himself and everyone asking him why. At the very end we get a glimpse of an alternate world where the angels never showed up, and all the characters have very different personalities. This is near the end, and from that part up until the closing shot it's pretty decent. Overall, the ending is just too needlessly boring. its the kind of "artistic" ending that a college film student will make and his teacher will praise, but everyone else in the class will fall asleep while watching. it may be "artsy" but its boring and peointlesly complicated and doesn't finish the stoy in any way.Also I have to point out that the music for this series is for the most part pretty awful. Although the opening song is quite catchy the background music and closing theme do not in any way inhance teh feel of the show. Its the same song every time an angle shows up, the same song every time something sad happens, and that's about it. The ending song, as is normal in anime series, is less than noteworthy.If you are thinking about watching this series, please for the love of god, watch it in Japanese. Do not ever bother with the English version, it sucks. If you read this review, please leave a comment.Replay value; High.

$REVIEW.: I agree with the reviewer who noted the historical innacuracies in the Tudors series. While some of these innacuracies can be condoned on grounds of poetic license, some appear to be egregiously gratuitous (i.e., having Henry's sister Margaret not only marry the King of Protugal--which never happned--but then have her murder him!) There appears to be no dramatic reason for that kind of historical innacuracy which is truly unforgiveable. On the other hand, I am more forgiving of the Series having Wolsey committ suicide rather than dying of natural causes inasmuch as there was some speculation at the time of his death that he did indeed commit suicide given that he was facing the curel justice of a vengeful Henry.(And certainly if Wolsey did committ suicide, Henry would have every reason to cover it up in a way that the historians could not access). A more serious criticism is that the Series apparently made no effort whatssoever to represent Henry even close to how the paintings of the day depicted him. Arguably the "young" Henry--depictions of which are quite rare--could have looked something like the actor in the Series, though the dark slicked back hair of the actor is hard to reconcile with the descriptions of Henry as more blond and stocky. And certainly the marine crewcut styles are even more difficult to reconcile with the images available. But perhaps the worst failure is to not have Henry age at all over his entire reign, especially given the numerous historical sources which all agree on his ballooning obesity and deterioration in his health. This failure is all the more stark given the near perfect depictions of Ann Boleyn and Katherine of Aragon by the actresses.(Especially the depictions of Anne Boleyn which is so nearly on the money that it's almost scary). So why, given these obvious deficiencies do I give this Series four stars? Because I applaud every attempt by the dramatic arts to make history interesting enough to inspire an interest in history. Many of those who watch this series will go to the history books and read the real stuff (and hopefully discover that Margaret never married the Kind of Portugal, and never in fact murdered him). Indeed, had the Series at least made a half-hearted attempt to depict Henry according to the sources available, and not engaged in the most egregious of it's historical innacuracies (the marriage of Margaret to the Kind of Portugal), I would have given this polished, entertaining, and addicitive production a full five stars. (I appreciate very much the use of candlelight in the indoor night scenes).

$REVIEW.: The most remarkable thing about "A Christmas Carol" is the way the intrisic morality of the story keeps it evergreen.The film versions seems to refect the values of their time: the 1935 version on the double DVD seems somewhat stale reminder of the remote British Empire, while the 1951 Alastair Sim interpretation has much of the uplifiting cheer of the many English comedies in austere post-war Britain.The evergreen aspects of the film are also found from the 1978 Rich Little send-up of the famous and infamous of his day and the Christmas Eve 2010 "Dr. Who" version with Dr. Who playing the spirit of Christmas Past may become a cult film.Time will tell which Christmas Carol is the most enduring. The Alastair Sim offering, apart from the family feel good aire, has a touch of "Wall Street" about it as an 18th. century Gordon Gekko greed-is-good charater drives Scrooge's business partners to the wall. Scrooge and Marley coldly demand 51% of the firm to save it from bankrupcy.Sim is well able to use those trademark doe eyes to show an inner cruelty and meanace in a Scrooge on the verge of his lifetime downward spiral into bitter cynicism...an alienation from humanity sealed by the loss of his beloved sister; dying in childbirth as his own mother died giving her birth.Yet this is a story of redemption and Scrooge finds a grace denied Marley. Sim's portrayal of Scrooge makes believable that even the deadest heart may be brought to life.The restored version is well served by low-key black and white, but I didn't go much for the colorized version...the color seemed, to me, to destroy this very mood and a be a pointless gimmick to show how clever the computer technicians were. The main value the included 1935 version was to show the viality of the Sim film.A good DVD to collect.

$REVIEW.: Some people drift through life, moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye; others latch on to a cause, another person or a principle and remain adamant, committed to whatever it is-- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it.  But we&#65533;re all different, &#65533;Made of different clay,&#65533; as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting.  Some people are just plain crazy, though-- and maybe that&#65533;s the way you have to be to live among the masses.  Who knows?  Who knows what it takes to make things-- life-- work?  Writer/director Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one &#65533;gets&#65533; committed-- and obsession, in &#65533;Committed,&#65533; starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too.  Her name is Joline, and this is her story.Admittedly, Joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general.  She&#65533;s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what.  And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it&#65533;s forever.  The only problem is, someone forgot to tell Carl-- and 597 days into the marriage, he&#65533;s gone; off to &#65533;find&#65533; himself and figure it all out.  When Joline realizes he&#65533;s not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage.  Maybe it&#65533;s because of that &#65533;clay&#65533; she&#65533;s made of.  Regardless, she leaves their home in New York City and sets off to find him, which she does-- in El Paso, Texas, of all places.  But once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him his &#65533;space&#65533; and not even letting him know she&#65533;s there.  She considers Carl as being in a &#65533;spiritual coma,&#65533; and it&#65533;s her job to keep a &#65533;spiritual vigil&#65533; over him until he comes to his senses.  And while she watches and waits, her life is anything but dull, as she encounters a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; Carmen&#65533;s &#65533;Grampy,&#65533; (Alfonso Arau), who is something of a mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has issues concerning Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her.  For Joline, it&#65533;s a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about Carl, but even more about herself.There&#65533;s a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot.  And Krueger presents it all extremely well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining.  Her characters are very real people, with all the wants, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story.  We see it from Joline&#65533;s point-of-view, as Krueger makes us privy to Joline&#65533;s thoughts and therefore her motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold.  That, along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates, makes for a very effective piece of storytelling.  There&#65533;s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter, but Krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that Joline encounters.  And the result is a well textured, affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life.Heather Graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make Joline a character totally of her own creation.  She immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable, adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person, and one that is real.  And for this film to work, it was imperative that Joline be viable and believable-- and Graham succeeds on all fronts.  Her screen presence has never been more alluring, and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you in entirely.  it&#65533;s all a part of the character she creates; there&#65533;s an appeal to Joline that exudes from her entire countenance, who she is inside and out.  She&#65533;s a likable, agreeable person, and because you&#65533;ve shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is.  It&#65533;s a good job all the way around, beginning with the way the character was written, to the way Graham brings her so vibrantly to life.As Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is totally engaging, as well.  Her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character.  She has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth.  She is refreshingly open and up-front; you get the impression that Carmen is not one to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that, too, is part of her appeal.  And, as with Joline, this character is well written, and Velazquez brings her convincingly to life.Overall, there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (as Joline&#65533;s brother, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, who, with very little actual screen time, manages to create a memorable character.The supporting cast includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl&#65533;s Editor), and Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist).  A film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider The Big Picture-- reflecting upon who we are, where we&#65533;re going and what we really need-- &#65533;Committed&#65533; is an enjoyable experience; a ride definitely worth taking.

$review_text.: World War Z is a great zombie movie


I read the book before watching Brad Pitt's big screen version and although it wasn't the 3-hour epic I was hoping for, Plan B has left plenty of room for a franchise

I hope they have set dates to begin production on part 2 and I also hope they do not let this summers string of flops deter them from moving forward


This was a crazy summer for Hollywood across the board


Zombies continue to be hot and an early 2015 sequel would be nice, a Halloween 2014 release would be even better

I'm sure Brad Pitt knows that "The Battle for Yonkers" must be included in the next version, as well as the wealthy "Mansion" scenes


Including the downed pilot would also be a huge addition
I think they did a great job with the first one and hope they take it even further for part 2 with a 3-hour epic!

$REVIEW.: We purchased this set because the Acorn Media DVDs were so excellent.  Because the episodes were taken from short stories, those were padded a bit, but nothing essential was changed.  David Suchet is the definitive Poirot, so it's sad to see him connected with such poor adaptations of Christie's character.  Perhaps the viewers who liked this series have never read the stories and therefore are unaware of the deviance from the originals.  If you have nothing against changing the killer from one person to another or making nephews sons and cousins sisters or adultery where there was none, or changing the name and nationality of a murder victim, sex scenes not even inferred in the originals, and which mostly just add to the confusion,  well, sit back and enjoy this series.  Even if I could suspend my disappointment with the way the stories were so untrue to the originals, and after all, those have survived many decades without the necessity to gut them, missing in this series is the lightness, the warm interaction of Poirot, Hastings, Miss Lemon, and Inspector Japp.  I miss the twinkle in Poirot's eye.  Thank you, Acorn Media for your version of Poirot, and only yours will I purchase in the future.

$REVIEW.: Having owned the 20the anniversary DVD since it's release, I was a little weary of this on blu-ray. After all, a 16mm 1:33.1 shoestring-budget film shot almost 30 years ago, would be a hard-sell on high-def. But boy, I am glad I caved.A young man and his deformed Siamese twin, separated at birth, check into a seedy 42dn Street hotel. They soon plot their revenge against the doctors who separated them. All the while causing some other mayhem at the hotel. This a fun, trashy and gory flick. Made back in the glory of days of true grindhouse cinema, when old 42nd Street was 42nd Street, sleazy, rundown, porno theaters, etc, before the Disneyification. An accurate representation of that era in NYC's history.Lots of bloodshed in this one, gorehounds take note.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) A man ripped in half, a woman with scalpels in her bloody face are just a taste of what we get. Again, that wonderful ultra-sleazy atmosphere and feel. Pure guerrilla film-making at it's finest. Lots of good laughs as well,unintentional, well, yes, but that's all the fun of it. It's too bad they don't make them like this anymore.The blu-ray picture is as good as it's ever going to be. Fully restored to it's OAR of 1:33.1(when it was blown to 1.85, a lot of info was missing)and remastered from it's original 16mm negative, natural film grain abounds. Picture looks cleaner and more watchable than ever. Some blue scratches pop up occasionally, but they did on the DVD as well. Audio is the original mono track, so purists will be pleased. Very clear sound.Extra wise, we get a new intro by the director, the man himself, the great Frank Henenlotter. For two minutes, he explains why he did this for blu-ray and the long process of doing so. Very nice. Up next, we get the audio commentary lifted from the DVD. Very fun track as Frank and co. reflect on making this movie, it's reception, legacy and many troubles. They even mention how the great Joe Bob Briggs saved this film from being permanently butchered at the idiotic request of the long-defunct Analysis Releasing. Next of course, is the 15-minute feature In Search of the Hotel Broslin. Frank and a friend go to the locations they filmed, including the club they filmed some scenes in. Very interesting and informative. A very nicegallery of outtakes and behind the scenes footage follows. Brief at 5 minutes, but def worth a look. TV spots, trailers, radio spots and still gallery of art are the other features. Now, the blu-ray is missing two extras from the DVD: a radio interview with Terri Susan Smith and a segment showing clips from Beverly Bonner's old TV show,"Laugh Track". Not a big deal. I will hang onto the DVD as well.This is a must-see/own for horror/cult/grindhouse and of course a must-own for fans and Frank Henenlotter fans. Highly recommended.

The blu-ray looks awfully crappy: all my doubts during the grainy episode one were confirmed in the first scenes of episode two when some kind of grid of regular white scratches hovered on the screen ! I am very upset, because the DVD sets of the previous seasons never showed such distracting defaults. And I know for fact TV series on blu-ray can be stunning (HBO true blood's first season). I wish someone put an end to any attempt from blu-ray editors to sell such a bad product : they are the one that are destroying the market and they are doing it right now.

$review_text.: They finally got Batman right.  The other Batman flicks gave you a brooding, dark vigilante, but they never told you how he got that way.  This movie does.The title actually explains it all.  From the senseless murder of Bruce Wayne's parents through all the training he went through and why he donned the cowl.  Sounds boring, doesn't it?  Well, it isn't.  The story is very well told and kept me engaged throughout.I guess this was the movie where you could actually sympathize with Bruce Wayne.  You get to know the tortured man behind the mask.  This wasn't so much a "Batman" movie as it was a Bruce Wayne movie, at least in the first half of it.This isn't just a good comic book movie, this is a good movie period.  There's a plot to keep you riveted and plenty of action too.  You even get to see how Batman got his hands on all his toys, not to mention why he decided on a bat for his emblem.For comic book officionados, I'll say that this story isn't canon (you comic folks will know what I mean).  I think they tried to get away from maniacal or cartoonish bad guys (joker, penguin) and went with one that was more recent in the Bat World (I'm not telling who the bad guy is) but was on the more reasonable side.It's the best Batman movie because it's a story with a comic book hero in it and not a comic book story on the screen.At the end, all I could say was "WOW!"Only one warning.  The batmobile is cool, but it sure isn't what you're used to.Added note:  I've been reading other reviews that state that Michael Keaton was the best Batman.  Please stop.  You're cracking me up.  Yes, I saw it.  Geez!As for the lack of humor: IT WASN'T SUPPOSED to be a comedy or a satire.  You've learned about Batman through the Burton/Shumaker films, evidently  You want to understand The Batman?  Read the comics and graphic novels.

$review_text.: This movie goes beyond the ordinary WWII movies and it wants to explore another dimension of war: how people is willing to kill his own comrades to get promoted and obtain the highest war decoration: the Iron cross. For obvious reasons the writer and director avoided presenting the US army as having those kind of troubles and they have to select a different combatant. Of course they selected the Germans, the regular villains in all movies. But wait the movie is not about presenting the Germans as the idiotic and stupid monsters that we see in all movies but as real human beings good and bad. It brings a little more balance into WWII history and shows another reality that the Soviet troops were far from being angels. Let's avoid the argument about who killed more people if Stalin or Hitler. In fact in a war it is difficult to differentiate between good and bad guys because all have the same mission killing other humans beings. However the main character James Coburn rises above this awful environment and demonstrates by showing his humanity that is possible to transcend the degradation of war even if at the end he might died.

$REVIEW.: Reading the other reviews here, I think there are a lot of people missing the point of this series

It's pure entertainment, plain and simple


It's not entirely fair to compare it to the original "Bewitched", although there's a temptation to do so


The casting of Lisa Hartman as Tabitha, and David Ankrum as Adam, works because she resembles Elizabeth Montgomery, and he Dick York, enough to make you believe Samantha and Darren could be their parents


Keeping Adam a mortal was the right way to go, since he was mortal on the original show

The unaired pilot made him a warlock, which would have detracted from the show if he had been portrayed that way


It would have been great if the parents had made a guest appearance (Sandra Gould and George Tobias reprising their roles as Gladys and Abner Kravitz was welcome)
Robert Urich as an egotistical talk show host worked; he really looked the part

Karen Morrow was also terrific as Aunt Minerva, Tabitha's "guardian witch"


Anyway, this is a cute show that deserves a look
Don't judge it entirely as a "Bewitched" spin-off


Take it on its own merit.



$SUMMARY.: Not "Bewitched", not "MTM"; Let it shine on its own

$review_text.: Keira Knightley fans may get a kick out of this movie since she is topless for a split second. But for the movie as a whole, you may feel slightly disappointed or moderately pleased. Short plot snypnosis: four hormone-driven teens ditch a scheduled school field trip to party out in an abandoned bomb shelter, an event that goes terribly awry when they are trapped in this "hole," which gets gut-wrenchingly disturbing as days go by.Of course, sex, drugs, drinking, and just pure partying is what goes on in that "hole." But once they realized that they're locked in, everyone starts going insane, which leads to deaths. Only one person managed to escape the hell-hole. A girl named Liz (Thora Burch). You think I already gave too much away? You'll know right away once you see the first five minutes of the movie when we see her walking around, obviously tramautized. She then tells the story, which results in numerous flashbacks. But then things get a lil' twisted when another person argues that her story is completely inaccurate and false. For a good half of the movie, we are falsely informed of the event. Now our story gets rolling through pieces of flashbacks...The movie's theme revolves around obsession and one's desperate way to get what he/she really wants by any means necessary. Liz wants to get the attention of the boy she adores but can't seem to acheive such desire. She's like the "social outcast" type. The "weird" one... kinda like the other character she played in "American Beauty," only with a more demented mind and soul. You may love her or hate her, or express both feelings simultaneously, particularly in a scene where Liz is calmly talking to Frankie (Keira Knightley), who is just puking her guts out in a bathroom. Liz doesn't express any emotion and doesn't seem to care for Frankie. Man, talk about how horrible humans can be. The movie also stars Desmond Harrington(from "Wrong Turn" and "Ghost Ship") as Mike, the boy Liz has a deep crush on, and Laurence Fox as Geoff, Frankie's love interest. Altogether, they provide good acting as a group of friends trying desperately to survive.You'll be shocked, you'll be disgusted, but most likely, you'll at least enjoy this movie. I wouldn't consider it a psychological thriller since "To Die For" (with Nicole Kidman) also had a similar theme, but I guess what makes it a psychological thriller is that it makes us think and try to figure out what really went wrong in that hole, why the teens were trapped down there, and who would be so cruel as to leave them remained trapped there. Love it or hate it, you'll feel disturbed for quite a while. That's what I felt. I liked it, but at the same time I disliked it, particularly of the movie's weak plot, but it's still amazing that a good thriller came out of such a topic, even if it went over the top.The DVD doesn't have much extra stuff. Just some ho-hum deleted scenes and a commentary. And for some reason, on the back of the case, it reads "Widescreen (2.35:1)" when the movie is actually presented in a 1.85:1 ratio. I dunno... it could only be my copy.The tagline on the US reads "Once you get in, you can't get out," whereas the British version reads "Desperate to get in, dying to get out." I think the latter works much better since the first is kinda misleading.

$REVIEW.: It seemed like every 5 minutes somebody was making a toast in this movie.  I finally realized it was to hammer in the point that &quot;About Schmidt&quot; is really about communication, or lack of.  Jack's character can't communicate with his wife or daughter, nor can they with him.  The only people Jack can communicate with are either people he's never met (Ndugu, the child he is sponsoring overseas) or people he hardly knows (the couple he meets while trekking out to see his daughter).  This makes for a few funny moments, but I hardly think this is one of Nicholson's best.  If you enjoyed &quot;As Good as it Gets&quot; you'll enjoy this.  If you didn't, don't waste your time.

$review_text.: A lot of people I know criticize widescreen format videos and DVDs
They  say it looks like part of the movie is cut off
JAWS is the film I use to  convert them

I show them the video I own in pan-and-scan mode, usually a  scene where the shark pops out of the water when Brody, Hooper, and Quint  are on the boat

Then I show them the DVD widescreen version.What a  difference! In the first version, you can only see most of the shark's head  and one of the people on board

In the widescreen, you see everyone


 Spielberg has a terrific eye and knows how to compose a frame


And the  widescreen format is the only way to do justice to this fun and scary  film.The new DVD also has terrific and rich color
The sound is great  and will remind you why John William's soundtrack is famous 25 years later

 But you can also hear other sound effects Spielberg stuck in, like a muted  dinosaur roar when the shark is sinking at the end
This, along with many  other interesting tidbits, was revealed to me with a behind-the-scenes  featurette that comes with the extras on the DVD


There's interviews with  the cast members today, as well as a fun trivia game


I also found the  deleted scenes interesting, although I'm glad Spielberg didn't use them

 The extras gave me a glimpse on how a film is made


When I rewatched the  film, I had a new outlook to what went into it
The outtakes and the photo  gallery were useless, but don't let that stop you from buying this


If  you're a fan of the film, you will want to own this.

$review_text.: The initial concept of the Borg was chilling in its simplicity: they are a cyborg collective consciousness that consumes all
Everything they encounter is viewed as raw material to be absorbed and made Borg
The Borg are not interested in power or conquest or wealth


 They consider being Borg pretty much the pinnacle of existence

They want to "raise quality of life for all species," as Picard-Locutus insists

The way to do that, in Borg philosophy, is to make all species Borg.This was the pure idea of the Borg introduced in 1988 in the episode "Q Who" and continued on an epic scale in "The Best of Both Worlds," both stories featured in this excellent collection


While I think the idea of the collection is terrific and I bought it on sight, the episodes gathered here only highlight how the Borg concept became corrupted by writers who decided to meddle with the core idea in search of ways to explore well-trodden issues rather than confront the real problems thrown up by the Borg concept: what do you do with such an opponent? How can you win? Is there any chance of a negiotated co-existence? If so, on what terms and how to get there?The rot starts with "I, Borg," when we meet the cuddly Borg, Hugh
Hugh, once disconnected from the collective, turns to be just a nice kid, a bit pallid and prone to weaing silly black outfits
In a stroke, the writers butchered the pure Borg concept by making individuals of the drones

Now the collective Borg consciousness was cast more as a tyrannical ruler over coerced individuals, and not a single organism with multiple dependent parts (the drones)


The movie (not included) continued down this path by introducing the Borg Queen

They tried to make it seem like the Queen was merely a manifestation of the collective, but the tyrarnnical nature of that collective was only reinforced by its incarnation

The Borg became less chillingly alien and more familiar: they had power structures after all, an identifiable ruler with whom Picard could argue and win points of order.The nadir was reached with the dreadful two-parter "Descent," where we get fully individualized Borg, complete with names and bad attitudes
Now the Borg really were little more than pale blokes in black suits.The ST: Voyager stories compensate somewhat, esp
the epic two-parter "Scorpion." My main gripe here is that the post-movie Borg look about 50% as cool as the original ones introduced in "Q Who." The Borg outfits now look like jumpsuits with bits stuck on, there are far fewer tubes and mechanized limbs, their death pallor has given way to mottled skin with a greenish tinge, and they have menacing, snarling expressions


This makes the Borg malevolent and evil, when the beauty of the initial concept made them far scarier -- they were totally indifferent as they went about their Borg business and destroyed your way of life

The continued exploration of Borg Rehab with the individualizing of Seven of Nine in "Drone" underlined the mistakes made in "I, Borg."Finally, it was a dreadful mistake to introduce Borg into ST: Enterprise, a story that opens this collection (which is arranged by Stardate chronology)
This opened a series of glaring contradictions and discontinuities that go unresolved
If the Archer Enterprise encountered the Borg, photographed them, studied them, and fought them, why were they such a complete surprise to Picard's crew some 200 years later? Weren't they already in the Federation databanks? Hadn't the Federation been given a 200-year lead time to prepare for the inevitable invasion? If so, why the less than a year of thinking about them in "The Best of Both Worlds"? And if Archer encountered the post-movie Borg (with their injected nano-technology and green skin) why did Picard encounter pallid, non-nano-equipped Borg two centuries later?The Borg represent a great idea that was corrupted by uninspired writing


But you still have to have this collective, if you're a Borg lover


I give it five stars, despite the presnce of dross like "I, Borg" and "Descent."

$review_text.: The GoodThis DVD is packed with all of Peter Gabriel's videos from his very beginnings as a solo artist in the late seventies, right up to the present day. There are over twenty videos and each video serves as a marker in musical history and video technology. Most of the videos come with the option of viewing a brief introduction, which I highly recommend. "Father, Son" is a simple ballad of admiration that is simply Peter at the piano, mixed with home video footage of him and his father today. "Sledgehammer" harkens back to sixties soul music tonally, while visually reminds you how far we've come with stop motion technology."Blood of Eden" depicts the Biblical image of man and woman being as one. The intro to "I Don't Remember" is quite interesting because it shows Gabriel in the studio with the `high-tech' recording equipment of the time. The video itself is rather weird and the sound recalls early Duran Duran. "Big Time" uses more stop motion effects while Gabriel parades around as a cheesy salesman. Although the song is enjoyable, the is a deep meaning behind it. "Lovetown" uses a lot of computer effects, which must give great relief to Gabriel from the rigors of stop motion. "Red Rain" is what our failure to express emotions turn into according to Gabriel. The video isn't as over-the-top as most of his videos. It's shot on a sound stage with a lot of shadow lighting.To me, the only image the ballad "In Your Eyes" conjures up to me is John Cusak holding a boom box over his head outside of Ionne sky's window in Say Anything. The video does not apply to the movie in any way. "The Barry Williams" show is not a direct shot at the former Greg Brady (although he does make a cameo in the video), but it is a shot a Jerry Springer. The song and the video trashes his show and other shows like it for sensationalizing improper behavior for profit, when they should really get those people professional help. "Biko" is a split screen video where one half is a live performance and the other are clips from a movie that explored issues involving human rights issues."Kiss the Frog" is a computer generated video with some live action that was created to coincide with motion odyssey rides (the ones where the chair moves to the motion in the video). You the viewer witness the video from the point-of-view of a frog. "Shaking the Tree" is a simple video that takes place on the beach and explores African music and culture. During the introduction of "Shock the Monkey", Gabriel is at a junk yard trying to record smashing noises for effects on the track. There are several takes of Peter trying to smash a TV that's worth a laugh of two. The video must have been filmed around the same time as "I Don't Remember" because it is very similar to it. Gabriel goes back to his roots so to speak with "Steam". He uses the same director as "Sledgehammer", and the video has a similar look and feel to it as well, except with updated effects and graphicsThe extras a slim, but will appeal to die-hard fans for sure. There's a 2004 live performance video for "Games Without Frontiers". There's a 1977 video for "Modern Love" that has Gabriel dressed as a demented football player walking up and down an escalator without steps. The video for "The Nest That Sailed the Sky" has a Cirque De Soule feel to it. It's shot from high above the concert stage while footage of acrobats are layered over it. A trailer for a documentary that Gabriel's daughter shot on his 2002-2003 tour is included. It's titled A Family Portrait, Growing Up Live. The trailer is a behind-the-scenes look at Gabriel's relationship with his daughters who went out on the tour with him. There is also a trailer for the live performance DVD of the Growing Up Live Tour, and a trailer for the Secret World Live Tour. Both shows appear to be loaded with lots of great visuals, effects, and lighting.The BadVideos should have run chronological.The VerdictPlay: The Videos is the perfect time capsule for Peter Gabriel's career. Not only do you get to witness how Peter developed musically, you get to witness how music video presentation and technology has evolved. All the videos, in their own unique way, reinforce how innovative and ahead of his time Peter Gabriel was (and still is).

I love the way  this movie has aged -- its black and white New York, with a Macy's that you  can practically smell, paint a quaint, innocent time, and populate that  time with characters that still have a contemporary freshness to them --  Maureen O'Hara, who is deliciously self-aware, tells her little girl there  are no such things as fairy tales -- having a bitter heart from a man who  has obviously abandoned her.  It is her heart, and little Natalie Wood's  (who is amazingly precocious and adorable) that Edmund Gwynn must melt by  the time Christmas Eve rolls around.  The simplest of plots, with a lovely  cornball quality, tumbles forth with warmth and amusement.  And it is again  the things we do not see but imagine -- as when Kris tells Maureen outside  of Macy's, the 34th Street sign hovering above them -- that he must be on  his way; it is Christmas Eve after all -- that give it a special layer of  Christmas fantasy.  I dearly love this movie, and virtually every remake  pales in comparison.  Gwynn will make you believe -- he justifiably won the  Oscar playing Kris Kringle.

 I had never seen a Tyrone Power movie before, but I have to say that starting today I've become a fan
 Tyrone Power gives a sumptuous performance as Zorro
 The movie will keep you interested all along, and the whole cast is one of talented actors

 Better than "The Mask of Zorro" with Antonio Banderas, I recommend this movie to any Zorro fan.

$REVIEW.: Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the ClonesA long time ago a great director named George Lucas created a groundbreaking trilogy in the sci-fi/fantasy genre.  He called it Star Wars and told it as the second trilogy.  Now he is creating the first trilogy and since we are at the mid-way point of the story arc it is easy to see that George has forgotten what made the magic of the first series.The Phantom Menace introduced the audience to Anakin Skywalker, better known as Darth Vader, as a child.  We also were given glimpses of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and Princess Amidala.  Attack of the Clones brings us Anakin and the other characters 10 years in the future.  Amidala has become a Senator from her planet and Anakin is firmly entrenched as a student of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  They meet up again when Anakin and Kenobi are called back by the Jedi Council after a failed attempt on Amidala's life.Kenobi decides to follow up on evidence concerning a clone army being built while tracking the bounty hunter, Jango Fett, who launched the attack.  He reluctantly assigns his student to follow Amidala back to her home planet as a bodyguard.  Anakin is initially against this but realizes that his childhood crush on Amidala is becoming a more adult love so he complies.As Anakin and Amidala grow closer, Kenobi discovers all the information concerning the clone army and tracks the bounty hunter to his meeting with his boss Darth Tyrannous.  After Kenobi is captured, Anakin and Amidala decide to launch a rescue ahead of the Jedi Council team led by Mace Windu.We then see the might of the Jedi unleashed against an army of Droids and the arrival of Master Yoda at the head of an army of clones beginning the Clone Wars mentioned in the original Star Wars movie.This seemed to be very much two different movies.  The first half is a love story between Anakin and Amidala and the second half is a Star Wars movie.  The thing that worked so well in the original trilogy is the chemistry between the characters.  The three principals carried the movie and made you want to see each additional episode.  There is nothing like that in this movie.  The only characters that exhibit any chemistry at all together are C-3PO and R2-D2, which is a bad thing to say since they are DROIDS and contrary to popular rumor, this wasn't a love story about them.  Natalie Portman again plays Amidala and, while Natalie is a good actress, she has no chemistry whatsoever with her co-star.Hayden Christensen is cast as Anakin.  In the future Vader was an imposing figure.  Right now, Anakin is played as a talented brat.  True, the seeds have been planted which will facilitate Vader's fall to the dark side but right now he seems more like someone who just needs his behind pattled.  Hayden Christensen has absolutely no concept of the character and can't play any type of menace.  He sulks but that is about it.Perhaps it would be best to throw the blame also at Lucas as Hayden is mouthing the lines written and in that matter, Lucas has made major mistakes as the dialogue is atrocious.  It was almost agony to sit through some of the discussions between the characters, as everything seemed false and flat.While the dialogue was absolutely awful and the actors need some serious re-casting, this was a visually exciting movie.  The space scenes, the battles, and the backgrounds are all breathtaking on the big screen.  Unfortunately the special effects didn't carry the first trilogy and Lucas really needs to remember that.The last portion of the movie does save things somewhat as we have an all out Jedi battle, which is entertaining to watch.  Finally Lucas has released Master Yoda and, like the Droids, Yoda steals the show from the human actors.  Lucas has a lot to make up for in the final movie and hopefully he will be able to do so.  Right now things don't look too good for the trilogy though.

$REVIEW.: From the opening credits Final Destination sets the pace for what is an action packed bloodfest must see movie.  The film is based around one particular character (Devon Sawa) who is amongst a group of american school kids who are about to fly to France on a field trip.  Upon boarding the plane that is about to fly the kids to France, Devon falls asleep and has a premonition that the plane is going to crash.  Once awakening Devon causes a fuss and is instantly removed from the plane with about six other members from the party.  Once the plane eventually takes off it explodes leaving all the removed in shock.  What followes on from this is quite a good story line about death trying to catch up the escapees.  The people that were removed from the plane were the ones that were suppossed to of died so death has set up a new design for each of them.  So when the surviors are being killed off one by one (in some of the best death scenes i have ever seen)  they all group together to try and avoid being next on the grim reapers list.

$review_text.: The darkest of black comedies, and the best French film of 2000, &quot;WITH A FRIEND LIKE HARRY&quot; (Miramax, $33), arrives on DVD with a slight title change (originally &quot;Harry, he's here to help&quot;) and an English dub.  Going into too much story detail will spoil the viewing experience.Even a simple summary does not do justice to the dangerously wicked unfolding of the story that starts when two guys Michael (Laurent Lucas) and Harry (Sergi Lopez) bump into each other in the men's rooms of a rural gas station.  It seems they went to school together but haven't seen each other for at least a decade. Harry vividly recalls some good times that  don't seem to mean much to Michael.Harry and his fiance end up at the country home of Michael, his wife and two screaming kids.  Michael tells Harry, who is rich, about the pressure of helping his aging parents and problems with his scheming brother.  This is a slick, ironic, taught, cynical, intense and unexpected thriller, minimalistically written and stylishly directed by Dominik Moll. Finishing the implied title phrase (&quot;With a friend like Harry ... who needs enemies?&quot;) is not giving away any secrets because in actuality, scary Harry is only the id to Michael's ego. Watch it in French with English subtitles, it's even better.  Or worse.  Depending on your frame of mind.

$REVIEW.: A few SpoilersI really liked the transformation of Jean Grey in this film, it was cool to see the resolution of a strand in the series in which Grey was initially one of the weakest of the mutants (in the first film) yet all along was the greatest but was holding in her powers. The Phoenix is very well portrayed by the gorgeous Famke Janssen, when she gets mad her face appears alien and terrifying (hats off to the cgi team) and her powers exceed all others (which makes sense since full strength telekinises WOULD give her an advantage against anyone else).I also liked the deaths which occurred, it was good to see the back of cyclops whose laser beam talent was never effectively dealt with by the filmmakers over the three films and whose constant grumpiness was a turnoff. Xavier was always interesting in the series yet it is good when a director is not afraid to kill off the major characters. I wish they had not killed the Phoenix off the way they did though, then again she IS the Phoenix and if there is a new film she may be back!I agree with another reviewer that maybe Storm should have been the one pitted against the Phoenix, but would telekinesis affect lightning?Ian Mckellan puts in a good performance as the twisted Magneto, we see him all holds barred here, throwing bridges and cars around like they were toys and Pyro is an eye catcher as the human flamethrower. I still think Magneto and Pyro should have been able to wipe the floor with the opposition in the showdown at the end... I also think that some of the new villains were not interesting enough, their clothes and attitudes and powers were too similiar and perhaps the director tried to introduce too many new mutants overall, i mean... was Angel really necessary? In any event i hope the makers bring Phoenix back for the next film and also use Mystique again in some way.

$REVIEW.: Too many horror flicks today rely on special effects and/or sheer gore, at the cost of atmosphere, good acting and a true plot line.  This film takes you back to real shiver-up-your spine horror that builds, quietly, thoughtfully, inescapably, until you feel as trapped and doomed as the oil workers.  This is not a film that makes you jump in your seat and shriek.  This is the kind of film that draws you in, seduces you, and then leaves you shivering and thinking and shivering again for a long time.  Nothing in this movie is what you expect or anticipate.  There is no clear-cut monster or evil force or ghost or bad guy, just shades of gray, and that's part of the horror.  It contains a strong environmental overtone, but whatever your thoughts on climate change, after you watch this movie you'll never look at winter quite the same way again.

$REVIEW.: To a fearsome extent, this Zombie story has it's roots in reality. Hello, I have been a fan of zombies since I was a 12 year old who saw Day of the Dead for the first time. I've seen a lot of the Zombie movies since then, and although most were unattractive, this one in paticular fits right in there with Romero's series.And not just because of the gore, either. That's what a lot of people like the movie for, and even though I hate to ruin the mystery why the dead walk in this movie, I'm going to tell it in this review, since most people miss the reason when they watch the movie anyway.One word: Voodoo. A belief that most civilized people discard and ridicule. But uncivilized people, however, know better, espeacially if they are Haitian. Ever since the French enslaved the people of the country now known as Haiti, a darkness was given birth to the religious beliefs of the land's inhabitants, and though Zombification is only part of that evil, it's the most terrifying aspect of the religion. People here in America might fear Death-Row for their Criminal behaviors, while people there in Haiti, fear to be zombified. The Haitian government allows it. And Zombification is a lot scarer of a punishment than Death-Row in my opinion, due to the fact that you're not only dead, but your soul is enslaved by a Voodoo priest, who is now empowered to control your physcial mortality, that's supposed to be buired six-feet under.This movie is more and less about the same thing (except the Zombies that walk the graveyards in Haiti don't eat human flesh) but Lucio obviously got the idea from the old French-African resurrection of the dead. The island the people visit in the movie, is dominated by a voodoo tribe (throughout the last hour of the movie, all you hear is the tribe screaming in the background and pounding on their drums) but what's really disturbing, is that you never see the tribe, which is the main reason why I think a lot of people miss the answer to the question why the dead walk there. No, the island isn't Haiti, but just as primitive.We go through the usual blood splattering, throat slashing and gut wrenching terror that we enjoy when we watch any Zombie movie once the visitors of the island learn that it's true the island is infeasted with walking corpses. A praise-worthy attribute. And not to mention the horrible task of your mian Characters who are left with no choice but to kill their loved ones who have fallen victim to the Voodoo curse, and VISE VERSA. {{GRINS}} That's always nice to watch. And there's this impressing scene--never seen anything like it in a movie--where a Zombie is feasting on a live shark at the bottom of the ocean. Lucio should of made the JAWS movies, because this was a real Tiger Shark, not anything plastic. WOW! The acting is a little off, but as far as Zombies and fantastic scenes like the Shark-Scene, you're going to see believable and convincing footage throughout the film. It's not fake at all. I rate the movie four stars. If you're into SERIOUS, DISTURBING horror, this is a must see.If you're looking for a more FACTual depiction on Zombies, I suggest the movie, 'The Serphent and The Rainbow' which I believe was directed by Wes Craven.R.I.P.

$review_text.: As a film unto itself, this adaptation stands as a well made movie. The production values compare quite favorably with western mystery films (not being much a Russian film buff this was a concern of mine before getting the DVD). Taken as a film this is a well made, well acted and 'good looking' effort. I didn't even mind the subtitles (which usually drive me to distraction). The one 'compliant' I would offer is that the subtitle translations are a little stiff (for lack of a better term). The language is very stilted and often humorous, but they are done well enough that you get the gist of what the actors are saying --- especially if you have read the original book or seen any of the earlier versions of the story.Regarding the inevitable comparisons to the earlier adaptations of Christie's story ( I have only seen the 10 Little Indians from the 60's and And Then There Were None from the 40's), this version is much closer to the original story. This is a much darker adaptation then these earlier efforts and hence not as 'fun' to watch. This film demands more work from the viewer than those earlier, lighter versions. Where those earlier films provided some comic relief (in the person of the bumbling, drunken butler in And Then There Were None and the ham handed sexual relationship in 10 Little Indians) this film has none of that. This is a serious mystery with serious portrayals.One caveat I might offer (especially in this age of political correctness) is that the statues in this versions are of black children. I mention this only because some may find offense in this aspect of the film.Other than this I would highly recommend this film to any serious mystery buff or follower of Dame Christie's work.

$review_text.: that Universal had let Rock Hudson make this movie with Marilyn as he so badly wanted to!  One thing for sure, there would have been no extramarital affair, as reported, but the chemistry would have been most interesting  based on his performances with Doris Day

 As one movie critic noted, there  was too much sexual tension between the stars, and that would have been  fine in a more serious movie

 Still, it's always nice to see Marilyn


 And  for the reviewer who said she didn't look her best, check her out in the  corset-type showgirl costume in the Milton Berle scene, and the  almost-off-the-body dress in the Chinese restaurant where Montand's  character declares his love for her

 I know Marilyn is still popular, but  when will we get to see her many widescreen movies, such as LET'S MAKE  LOVE, amongst others in a letterbox format with decent sound

$REVIEW.: Good thing it's only for $6.99.  Our 9-year-old son loves dragons so I thought these movies would at least entertain him.  Well, they didn't quite live up to his expectations.  The special effects were good enough for young children but the fighting scenes were badly done.  It looked like they were taking turns to swing their swords.Dragonquest storyline sounded interesting unfortunately the movie and actors couldn't deliver.  Nobody could act and the nude scene in the beginning was completely unnecessary.  The young keeper's adventures in finding the precious stones to complete his task were boring.  During one of his so-called adventures, the keeper stood in a cave motionless, just to let a giant spider (or some sort) walk by him.  That's all he needed to do to obtain a stone. How thrilling was that?  The ending of the movie was a bit better because there's not much acting, just a lot of special effects.The acting of the Merlin and The War of The Dragons was better compared to Dragonquest though some of the actors and actresses sounded more like reciting a school play.  Worst yet, the camera constantly zoomed in on people's faces as a result most of the beautiful Welsh scenes were wasted.  You can't really see what else was going on other than the close up expressions.  After a while it became annoying. The dragons in this movie looked a lot better than the good & evil transparent dragons in DragonQuest, but the story development was not well connected and remained unexplained.  My two boys sat through the movie simply because they thought I would be offended if they didn't finish it.For Merlin and The War of The Dragons, I give it 3 stars.  But for Dragonquest I give it only 1 star.  That averages 2 stars for this double feature.

$REVIEW.: Emma Thompson and Mike Nichols team up to bring us a heart-wrenching adaptation of Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play. Emma stars as Vivian Bearing ("B-E-A-R-I-N-G")--a scholar and professor of the metaphysical poetry of John Donne--who is going through chemotherapy ("the full dose") for Stage 4 metastatic ovarian cancer ("there is no Stage 5").Emma is absolutely believable in this tough role. She brings the sickness to life while making us sympathetic towards an unsympathetic (and "uncompromising") woman. I bought it all the way. Also of note are Audra McDonald as Nurse Susie, and Jonathan M. Woodward as Jason, a former student of Vivian's who is now her doctor.Nichols and Thompson adapted the screenplay (teleplay?) and expanded the setting, making it a fuller experience. As this was made for HBO, they were not tied down by expectations of box-office success and were thus able to create the true film that needed to be made. This is one of those rare films that is perfect in every way.

I am sure this would receive an "R" rating from MPAA.At the beginning of the film, the Chinese girls (who actually are the best part of the entire movie) are inspected for their virginity. This of course has some nudity and other quick uncomfortable shots. The only thing that would have made it more gratuitous would have been a copycat scene from Basic Instinct. Ok I can get past that but clearly I would not let younger family members see this. The one scene I could not believe actually made the final cut is the running of the horses. As masses of horses are running toward the camera on the right you can see a horse turn upside down and get obviously trampled, I am assuming to its death. I was incredulous that a scene like that would be left for viewers. Any director would have to know that would color someone's opinion from then on. Obviously SPCA didn't certify that no animals were hurt during the making of this movie. I am sure the scene where horses fall and are killed showed even less mercy for the animals. I just cringe thinking of how many were injured during the production of this saga.Other scenes were disjointed. How Ritter knew that that the two men were carring diseases when they tried to cross the trail is beyond me. It would have made a great dropping on the editing floor. The rape scene is another great selection for droppings.If you are considering buying this, do not expect it to be a family western and do not expect to feel good afterward. This film lacked class and was NOT tastefully done. I got the feeling that only men influenced the production of this and I regret spending the money on a film that made money off of the poor treatment of horses. Instead of being an artfully done feel good western, this saga left me with a sick feeling in the middle of my stomach. At the end of the story, I really didn't care that a scroll of what happend to the characters rolled by. If it was based on a true story, I don't think the real people portrayed would be proud of this version of the true events.Just beware if you choose this "Western" that you are not getting a classic or even one you will want to watch again.
$SUMMARY.: Disappointing and distasteful, NOTa family flick

$review_text.: I got this movie orginally to see Vincent Gallo's schlong and that I did. That is why I did give this movie 2 stars. The story of this movie is very boring and it is a very dull movie all in all. The dialong is awful and it's actors are boring as well. I am sorry, but I will have to say don't even bother with this movie unless you want to see Vincent Gallo or Chlo Sevigny nude. Other than that, don't bother.

$REVIEW.: Buyer beware!This is interesting, BUT IT IS NOT THE FILM ITSELF.It is an interesting hour special about some of the gang fans in Chicago. It also has some interesting facts about Al Capone. It tells a bit about how he started out as a troubled child, how he worked his way up through the gangs, how he had to fight off the Irish mafia, how he gained control of his own gang, and then was finally brought to justice, and even a bit about his final years when he was released from prison.Is this an interesting dvd? Yes. But is it the movie as a reasonable person might believe it is? NO!This DVD might be worth having. But know that you are buying an interesting documentary, and NOT THE FILM.

$REVIEW.: &quot;Know, O Prince, that between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of...Hither came Conan the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandled feet.&quot;  At least, that was what was written in &quot;The Nemedian Chronicles,&quot; the faux ancient text referred to by Robert E. Howard in his stories about Conan the Barbarian.  Conan had been a pulp fiction hero in the 1930s and the stories had been republished in the 1960s with great covers by artist Frank Frazetta, with some unfinished stories by Howard completed by L. Sprague De Camp, and Lin Carter, who also wrote some adventures to fill in the gaps in the Conan chronology.  Then Marvel comics launched a comic book version, scripted by Roy Thomas and drawn by Barry Smith, with many of the stories being adapted from Howard's original stories about Conan and other sword and sorcery adventurers.It was with that literary lineage in the realm of sword and sorcery that &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; was released in 1982, although it ended up doing more for Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting career than it did for the character he was playing, since the film spawned only one sequel, &quot;Conan the Destroyer.&quot;  Director John Milius covers the early years of Conan's career, when he was taken from his home in Cimmeria as a boy by a raiding party of Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), and sold into slavery.  Eventually he began a trained gladiator and eventually earned his freedom, where he became a thief.  The script by Milius and Oliver Stone essentially created a new narrative for the film, although readers of Conan will recognize scenes and elements from to &quot;The Thing in the Crypt&quot;, &quot;The Elephant Tower&quot;, &quot;Red Nails,&quot; &quot;Queen of the Black Coast&quot;, &quot;The Mirrors of Tuzun Thune,&quot; and &quot;A Witch Shall Be Born.&quot;Schwarzenegger's acting experience was rather limited at that point.  Having appeared (dubbed) as Hercules in &quot;Hercules in New York&quot; in 1970, with the billing of Arnold Strong, Schwarzenegger had done a series of small roles in small films and television shows.  However, in 1977 he appeared as himself in the documentary &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; and showed himself to be a charismatic spokesperson for the sport of body building.  However, all Schwarzenegger was really required to do as Conan was flex his muscles and grunt a few lines.  The key thing here is that he did look good.  The showcase sequence of the film is when Conan and his companions, Valeria (Sandhal Bergman) and Subotai (Gerry Lopez), sneak into the stronghold of Thulsa Doom to rescue the daughter of King Osric (Max Von Sydow), who has joined the Snake Cult.  With some pretty good background music by composer Basil Poledouris, the trio of thieves set up a diversion and launch a quick attack.  There is a moment when Conan, his body painted with black stripes as camouflage, gets into position to begin a sword fight that simply looks great.  The actual swordplay is rather limited, more slashing that actual swording, but we do get a sense of the power of Conan.James Earl Jones seems a bit distant as the villain, but he was engaged in a weird acting experiment where Milius told him how to do line readings and he did it.  In the end, it is Sandahl Bergman who surprisingly provides what little emotional impact the film exhibits.  A trained dancer, Bergman's elegant and fluid movements contrast nicely with Schwarzenegger's raw power, and she has a great way of looking at him that makes it clear which one of them has the brains in the operation.  More importantly, Bergman's Valerie seems totally at home in the savage world that the film creates.&quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; is not a great film, although it is arguably remains the best sword and sorcery film made to date, although clearly the competition for the honor is rather sparse.  Despite the overall woodenness of the acting, it does have the virtue of taking its characters seriously without descending into camp.  If anything it is the reluctance to find humor (although Conan does slug a camel in an apparent homage to &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;), that keeps this 1982 film on the high road, relatively speaking.  Consequently, while Conan fans might have hoped for something better, they certainly had ample reason to expect something much worse, and thus were relatively overjoyed by the end product.
$SUMMARY.: The original &quot;Conan&quot; is still the best Sword &amp; Sorcery flick

$REVIEW.: The fact that Paul Haggis's "Crash" won Best Picture at the Oscars this year and Cronenberg's "A History of Violence" was almost completely ignored is one of those things my stepfather must've been referring to when he told me that in life, I wouldn't get an answer to every question I might have


This is probably my favorite movie of 2005 and with good reason


It gets better every time I watch it


The acting on all counts is really, really good


The story is simple on the surface but thought provoking and incredibly multilayered underneath
The music by Howard Shore fits incredibly well and is worth owning the soundtrack for (well, I'm an unapologetic Howards Shore fan and just about anything he does is worth owning to me)


 The cinematography is top notch and Cronenberg's direction is assured in his usual low key style


It's almost completely different from the original source material (which in itself is well worth a read) but the changes made are just right for the film.I'm a bit disappointed at the overall reaction to this film


I think this was one of the better releases to come out in recent times, yet many people scoffed at it's content

There's much to be said about this film but I think the best thing about it is like I said before, it gets better every time I watch it


Hopefully it will for you as well.NOTE: The DVD for this film has a great collection of extras
The picture and sound are well put together


Most notably, it contains an exhaustive documentary on the making of the film, covering everything from the pre-planning stages for the film all the way to its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, where it received a thunderous standing ovation


Well worth the price of the disc, which runs something like $15.

$REVIEW.: Sure - you may quibble that there are not too many entries in this competition, but when it comes to Great Zombie Comedies, it's a pretty short list.  "Shaun of the Dead" may have the edge because it came first, but "Zombieland" is a wondrously funny, violent and human send-up of the over-saturated Zombie genre.Ever since "Scream" burst on the scene, a calling card of a hip movie is to walk the viewer through The Rules.  "Zombieland" employs that cliche to great effect when we meet Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a twenty-something survivor of an unexplained zombie apocalypse - this introduction is found in close proximity to one of the most ingenious sets of opening credits ever devised.  Columbus - who could be Jonathan Cera's cousin - was never much of a people-person but now is desperate for human contact.  He finds it initially in Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a smash-mouth redneck who loves nothing more than shredding zombie faces.  Harrelson has that unique combination of sweetness and menace that makes him one of the most exciting actors in Hollywood - and he can play Southern as convincingly as anyone.  Tallahassee's rules are no less fixed than Columbus's, and soon they are bonding over zombie carcasses and the Quest for the Last Twinkie.Tallahassee and Columbus soon find two attractive, intelligent young women (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) whose dedication to self-preservation may be a little extreme but provides some good comic moments.  Despite some initial mishaps, the foursome is soon on the road together, seeking salvation in a zombie-infested wasteland.Thanks to a witty script, some pitch-perfect acting, and one of the most inspired cameos in all of film, "Zombieland" is a true delight.  No, this isn't "Casablanca" or anything close to it.  But for what it strives to be, it's hard to imagine a better effort.  High marks across the board.

$REVIEW.: The Good Things*Extras include a featurette and trailer.*A number of heart-warmingly funny parts (but nothing knee-slappingly hilarious).*A number of slick special effects.*Good production design.*Generally a good story.  Even though it has no really strong conflict, it is epic, classy, and as sci-fi, brings up some interesting ideas about robotics.*Very strong themes concerning the nature of humanity.*Excellent characters, acting, and writing.*Good music.The Bad Things*The story is driven entirely by the main character's quest, and thus plays out more like a biography (kind of like "Forrest Gump" or something).  It is a bit long, and without any major conflict to drive the story, it can be seen as tedious or dull.The Questionable Things*Video quality is generally not bad, but some parts have obvious amounts of film grain or particles.*Thematic elements may not be appropriate for children (rated PG).This is a cute sci-fi movie with occasional bits of touching comedy, romance, drama.  Not only is it heart-warming and intriguing, but it also encapsulates a certain essence that makes it comparable to classic sci-fi (like the works of Isaac Asimov, whose works is a basis for this film).  Some people may find this kind of thing boring.  But for most serious sci-fi fans (and perhaps comedy fans), it is quite worthwhile.

$REVIEW.: Here is a great case of a film being made and released at the wrong time


 Director Jerry Thorpe's 'THE VENETIAN AFFAIR'-1967 is a masterful tale of intrigue and double crosses but unfortunately had two things against it: 1) It's leading man ,Robert Vaughn, was acting in one of television's popular shows at the time 'THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.'-1964-1968 causing audiences used to the humorous air of the show to be thrown for a loop at the seriousness and lack of action sequences contained within its 92 minute running time; 2) there was an onslaught of spy/secret agent films flooding the theaters from Europe to the US following the James Bond phenomena so with the films credits, people were expecting a TV movie being released theatrically as some of the two part U.N.C.L.E

episodes were packaged for US and over seas at that time
 The film flopped at its release and seemed forgotten if not for sporadic showings on Turner Classic Movies
 Warner Archive has given it a well deserved resurrection preserving it as an underrated espionage thriller with some great performances

 Vaughn plays an ex-CIA agent turned journalist assigned to investigate a possible terrorist bombing at a peace conference in Venice
 Vaughn approaches the role of Bill Fenner in a cool mea-culpa tone with traces of his U.N.C.L.E

character Solo creeping in once in a while


He would continue his movie roles with Director Peter Yate's classic 'BULLITT'-1968 as the corrupt cop Chalmers; Edward Asner ,before his future successful television career ,is excellent as Vaughn's ex boss stopping at nothing to get to the bottom of the affair


 The lovely Elke Sommer plays Vaughn's ex wife who double crossed him in the past and would go on to grace Director Ralph Nelson's underrated spy film 'DEADLIER THAN THE MALE' the same year ; Cameos by T.V

actor Roger C

Carmel (known as Harry Mudd on two 'STAR TREK' episodes at that time), the venerable Boris Karloff as ,what else, a nobel scientist, and the beautiful Luciana Paluzzi who played the lethal Fiona Volpe in Director Terrance Young's Bond classic 'THUNDERBALL'-1965 as Carmel's secretary
 The scene stealer is Euro actor Karl Boehm as Wall, an enemy agent who wants Karloff's plans for his own
Boehm, known for his performance in Director Michael Powell's unfairly maligned and ahead of its time serial killer thriller 'PEEPING TOM'-1960,gives his role an incredible air of evil

Director Jerry Thorpe, son of Director Richard Thorpe, known for his massive T.V

movie and series works, seems to have helmed only two theatrical features in his career, this one and 'DAY OF THE EVIL GUN'-1968


 He keeps the film moving in a slow, powder keg tone throughout which enhances the elements of the script

 With a catchy lounge music score from T.V


composer Lalo Schifrin (one of his best), beautiful photography from two time Oscar winner Milton Krasner showing off the breath taking Venetian locales and a good screenplay by Producer E.Jack Newman based on Helen MacInnes's  novel,  'THE VENETIAN AFFAIR' can finally be appreciated by modern day audiences


 It has flaws but it has a timelessness about it hauntingly reminiscent of our modern day terrorist happenings


 Warner releases it in a beautiful 2.35 widescreen transfer with a US trailer its only extra.

$review_text.: A New Start is a fitting name for this disc, since it has no relation whatsoever to any of the previous Tenchi story lines. Much like the Tenchi Universe series, Tenchi In Tokyo is yet another radical retelling of the same story. And like Tenchi Universe, Tenchi In Tokyo really pales in comparison to the original and still the best OAV series. Although it falls short of living up its OAV heritage, it's not a bad series by any stretch of the imagination. It's still fun and goofy, but it lacks polish and scale that made people gravitate to Tenchi in the first place. Thankfully, there's the manga out there to continue the original story line.

The shots of the sharks are done very well and I love seeing real sharks in the water and NOT fake puppets or CGI sharks.I love the story itself, except for a few things. I don't get this one scene in the middle of the movie. There are a few people that go diving underwater at the middle of the night. They are looking for oysters and they find them. But later, a person gets eating by a shark. I don't see why that scene was needed at all. We already know sharks are killing people. This was shown from the begining of the movie, so that scene wasn't needed at all.Another thing I didn't like about the movie was when the picture would get too dark to see. At the end of the movie is the worse, you can't tell who is who. It's so dark that you can barely make out water a objects, but you don't know if that's a person or something else. When someone gets biten, you don't know who it was until they say who it was. When they go underwater, you really don't know who is who. They are all are wearing the same thing and you can't really tell by seeing just their eyeballs with their masks on in a total dark picture.People should not buy this movie at all, maybe just rent, if you want to see real sharks and Halle.

The final rampage was fantastic even though you could tell the spider isn't there when the cgi was used

$review_text.: In 1934 noted American playwright Lillian Hellman introduced her play  "The Children's Hour" to audiences around the world.  Over the next couple of years the play would become a substantial hit.  The central theme of "The Children's Hour" is what happens when two young headmistresses are accused of having a lesbian affair by a disgruntled young student.  Of course the charges are not true but that will not stop the powers that be in town to destroy everything the two young women have worked so very hard to create.  In 1936, producer Samuel Goldwyn and director William Wyler would bring this powerful play to the silver screen.  SInce something called The Production Code (a set of motion picture industry censorship guidelines)  forbade the subject of lesbianism to be broached in films, Goldwyn and Wyler decided to change the name of the film to "These Three" and substituted the charges of lesbianism between the two teachers to a heterosexual love triangle involving the two young teachers and a doctor in town who is the fiancee of one of them.  As it turns out these changes did not detract from "These Three" one little bit."These Three" (a rather odd name for a film, don't you think?) stars Merle Oberlon and Miriam Hopkins as recently graduated young teachers who come to town with visions of creating a school in a run down old house that one of them has inherited from her grandmother.  Shortly after they arrive in town the girls meet up with a local doctor named Joe Cardin (Joel McCrea) who embraces the idea of the school and vows to help them make it become a reality.  In the course of renovating the property Dr. Joe and Karen Wright (Oberlon) fall head over heels for each other.  Meanwhile,  Martha Dobie (Hopkins) also has feelings for the dashing young medic but vows to keep her feelings to herself rather than compete for his affections with her best friend.  Funding for the school was obtained by the generous donation of the town's most prominent citizen Mrs. Amelia Tilford (Alma Kruger) who promises to send her young granddaughter to the school.  Bonita Granville plays young Mary Tilford who is evil incarnate.  Most critics agree that it is Granville who steals the show in this film.  Mary is not at all happy in this school.  She is in an incorrigible brat who as Dr. Cardin observes at one point in the movie could use a good dose of the hairbrush.  It is Mary who conjures up and spreads the story about the alleged  love triangle going on within the confines of the school.  As one might expect the results are devastating for just about everyone involved in this unhappy incident.Throughout the  course of "These Three" my wife and I kept turning to each other and remarking just how fabulous this film is.  The acting is first rate by virtually every single person in this movie including several of the children.  A special hats off to Marcia Mae Jones who plays the part of schoolgirl Rosalie Wells.  You will also find a very young Walter Brennan as well as Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West in 'The Wizard of Oz") with bit roles in this film. My wife and I continue to be amazed at the quality of the films that were made in the 1930's and 1940's.  "These Three" is just another example of what happens when great writing and fine acting come together.  As I mentioned in the headline above, "These Three" certainly rivals anything that the great Alfred Hitchcock  ever made.  Highly recommended!

$review_text.: Having watched this film three times since 1996,I keep revisiting it hoping that maybe something in me would change to make me like this film more,but it hasn't!!!When a movie wins nine Academy Awards I think,maybe the "intelligentia" knows better.They don't!!!This film is positively plodding. The acting or the screenplay is not anything exceptional in any way.(No small wonder that Fiennes and Scott-Thomas were beat out!)I am a person who is usually moved by what I see,but the more I view this picture,the more I realize why the SEINFELD show dedicated a whole episode to their hate of this movie.When I revisit the nominees for 1996 I see what a weak field this film was up against,but certainly FARGO,SHINE,SECRETS AND LIES and even JERRY MAGUIRE were more compelling than this 3-hour bore.To each his/her own.You will either love it or hate it.I preferred the latter vehemently!

$REVIEW.: Robson Green is back in the sixth and from what I found out final season of the amazing Wire in the Blood series.  I have always preferred the UK crime/mystery programming over the bland U.S. shows.  Season 6 is just as gripping and tension filled as the previous five seasons.  The crimes are just as bizarre, violent and twisted as the previous seasons and I absolutely love it.  Green is perfect as Dr. Tony Hill and Simone Lahbib is great as DI Alex Fielding.  If you have see the previous five seasons of Wire in the Blood then season 6 will be exactly what you expect......one of the best crime series I have ever seen.
$SUMMARY.: Absolutely Great

$REVIEW.: (Spoilers)Dark Knight is to be applauded for its effort to transcend the genre. As a comic adaptation, Christopher Nolan tries very hard to retain the philosophical and social commentary that comic books often possess. There is a depth to each character, even if it is just a caricature. An evolution of each, with a cerebral reason for their existence, not just a physical presence but a intellectual metamorphosis.To put it mildly, just like people who wish for peace and all things good, there are others who want chaos and destruction. Enter the Joker. He has no socio-economic reason to be evil. Its not greed for money or power. Its not even his motivation to contest Batman. His sole aim is to see the collapse of civilization and for 'society' to face the brutal truth which is... (what he thinks) the buried primitive instinct of our humanity. If anything, he wishes his nemesis batman to be his spectator.This premise works for me. Heath Ledger is simply amazing. Not because he has passed away, but because his presence on camera is captivating. His interpretation leaves Jack Nicholson empty handed. I say this after I had previously said, no body can do Joker like Nicholson. Amazing.I hate to say it but there is truth in the saying "want an oscar... play a mad man". It wont win him an Oscar, but nevertheless he alone propelled this movie high into the stratosphere!But this movie wasn't about Joker alone. Joker was only a third of this movie, which was a shame in hindsight.What is worse than katie Holmes...A woman that kinda looks like Katie Holmes...Has more of a droopy face than Katie holmes... is more winy ... more demanding... and more selfish than Katie Holmes.You know... back in the ol days they knew what to do with a whiny character like that. They would get rid of her all together for the Sequel. Remember Kim Basinger's character.Girl2: "What happened to Rachael...."Butler: "Oh ... they broke up. they argued too much".... And that was that!Christian Bale had a limited role as Bruce Wayne in this sequel. We saw more of him as Batman, and to be quite honest... I felt Batman was actually quite lifeless and dull. His voiceover is distracting to say the least, maybe because the content of his dialogue was not very absorbing.Two face was an oddball. An oddball of motives, of creation and of reaction. I didn't quite understand the reasoning for his transformation as a character. Yeh his face got burnt... but why all the hate towards the commissioner in the end. The connection between his fate with `chance' and his action to flip a coin everytime didn't have the same feasibility as Batman or Joker's introductions. I understood the importance of two face in this movie, but I wasnt as entertained in his presence. Could this have been better without him? Im not sure.The 2.5 hour story itself was a bit of a mish mash, I found the pacing of the movie was very loose. Parts which were too fast, parts which were too drawn out. Lets just say... I wasn't in this for the big bang action scenes... so I felt like some of the action scenes were lost on me. Christopher Nolan doesnt do action sequences well. They are often derivative, confusing, awkward, and illogical. MAybe partly my fault for becoming desensitized all these years, but the nail biting drama of it all felt underwhelming.The sonar technology was a bit over the top, I understood the whole symbolism of the Sonar... being a bat and all... but the matrix special effects kind of put too much in the spanner....Morgan Freeman's attitude was .... I'm happy to build you weapons of mass destruction but damn it... this big brother thing is going too far...Overall, a good movie, bravo Heath Ledger, but I felt the film itself was not amazing.I know I probably speak alone.
$review_summary.: It is good... but it isnt great 3.5

$review_text.: In theory and on paper, "Crazy, Stupid, Love" had the potential to be a disaster. It seems sometimes that studios have lost the ability to replicate anything resembling real life in the big budget fiascos that stand for romantic comedy these days. Do people really have to act like complete morons to find true love? How many uptight career women do we need to watch being tamed by adolescent and boorish men? While Dan Fogelman's screenplay certainly plays to the expected conventions, it is distinguished by a smart and genuine sense of humor that is grounded in identifiable and likable character types. It has a surprisingly hard edge which is quite refreshing. Incorporating adult themes, "Crazy, Stupid, Love" is a romantic comedy that you don't have to be embarrassed to like for it doesn't pander or insult your intelligence. Yes, it goes a little soft in the final act for my taste--but up to that point, the experience is rich, thoughtful and filled with laughs. And there are some super actors at the top of their game--which certainly doesn't hurt.The movie begins with the dissolution of a marriage. Steve Carell and Julianne Moore, as Cal and Emily Weaver, face the unpleasant truth about Moore's infidelity as she pushes for a separation. The resultant scenes have a bitter truthfulness which plays out in the most awkwardly humorous (and slightly disturbing)way. Much of the movie has Carell reeling and trying to make sense of his life. Ryan Gosling, as the neighborhood lothario, takes the unrepentant sadsack under his wing for some tutelage about making time with the ladies. Yes, it is formulaic in an only-in-the-movies kind of way--but both actors are so engaging, it's quite easy to overlook the convenience of plotting. Gosling, meanwhile, may have met his match with the spirited Emma Stone. These two share real sparks that intensify and deepen as the movie delves further into their bond. Not to be left out, there are several others involved in the romantic merry-go-round including Carell's son who is in love with the babysitter who in turn is in love with Carell. The movie twists around on itself, serving up surprises and sweetness. It all may be a bit gooey by the end, but the performers will keep you on your toes.Despite being a romantic comedy for grown-ups, perhaps the film's biggest (and most valuable couple) are Carell and Gosling. When these two are together, the picture soars. It is easily one of Carell's best roles and Gosling can do no apparent wrong (is he in every 2011 release?). Stone is quite winning. I also enjoyed brief but pivotal roles by Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon who cross paths with the central married couple. Even with the many subplots and peripheral characters, the film is focused and confidant. What is so amazing is that the picture feels fresh and new despite working squarely in familiar territory. Relatable and more real than it has any right to be, "Crazy, Stupid, Love" makes me yearn for other studio comedies to risk engaging both a viewer's heart and his brain. Give it a shot if you're looking for an adult film filled with big laughs, much heart, and one of the year's most adept ensemble casts. About 4 1/2 stars, I'll round up for the central bromance! KGHarris, 11/11.

$REVIEW.: Unlike many movies made today, The Cheyenne Social Club and Firecreek pit two veteran actors whose consummate skill and ability to tell a story makes special effects unnecessary-the quality of the story and the acting carry both movies.Both films feature great supporting casts, and Fonda and Stewart show why they qualify as screen legends in every scene. Cheyenne Social Club features Stewart as John O'Hanlon and Fonda as Harley Sullivan, two rough and tumble veteran Texas cowboys whose lives revolve around endless cattle drives and the stoic and simple life on the open range of the West.O'Hanlon's brother D.J. dies and leaves him as the sole owner/proprietor of the Cheyenne Social Club, the most notorious brothel in the wild west. Fonda tags along for the ride as Stewart rides the 1000 mile journey to claim his inheritance. The men of Cheyenne consider the Social Club as a hallowed and precious shrine. O'Hanlon is shocked to discover the real meaning of his inheritance and announces to the madam, artfully played by Shirley Jones, and her bevy of beautiful women that he intends to close the brothel and open a respectable boarding house in it's place.The firestorm against O'Hanlon by the townspeople and his employees begins a tour de force comedy romp with the befuddled Stewart trying to weather the storm while Sullivan watches bemused from the sidelines. This movie features two veteran actors and a superb supporting cast at their very best. The sex is suggested rather than "in your face" like today's movies, but gets the sexual points across gracefully without being crude, graphic or clumsy.The end result of O'Hanlon's adventure is a classic cautionary tale of being careful what you wish for-you just might get it! The movie is bittersweet, ironic, and emotional without being maudlin, and shows why these stars from the golden age of Hollywood films set the standard for great acting and class performances.While Fonda and Stewart give great performances in Firecreek, I find this movie to be rather Hollywood formula and too close to "High Noon" in the concept of the story. But, if you love Fonda and Stewart as actors, it's hard not to like how these legendary actors tell the story, as rivals pitted against each other on opposite sides of the law. The problem is not the actors, but the story they have been given has been done before. So they have little room to breathe fresh life and a new perspective into a basic formula western.What Stewart does so well is make you sympathetic and willing to support his underdog character. He must use his wit and grit to overcome evil men and seemingly insurmountable odds, a classic position for Stewart in so many movies. Fonda gives a credible performance as the "bad-guy", but his performance in that type of role in such classics as "Once Upon A time in the West" gave him a better vehicle to explore his turn as an evil and criminal man with no scruples and little compassion.

$review_text.: Bottom-Line:  Skip it!I have never been a big Tyler Perry fan.  Millions of people are and having seen a handful of his movies and television offerings I cannot for the life of me understand why.  His offerings are often simple affairs that lack intellect, depth, and any real interest outside a certain demographic.  And yet the man makes millions of dollar peddling what amounts to modern day "Step & Fetch It" movies.Tyler Perrys' "The Family That Preys" (2008) staring Sanaa Latham, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard, Rockmond Dunbar, and Taraji P. Henson does not fall far from the minstrel tree, despite its stab at the dramatic.The StoryWritten and directed by Tyler Perry (I Can Do Bad All By Myself), open on the wedding of Andrea (Sanna Lathan ~ Out of Time) and Chris (Rockmond Dunbar ~ Soul Food) being held at the home of Charlotte Cartwright (Kathy Bates ~ Titanic), a wealthy construction business owner in Atlanta.  Charlotte is holding the wedding for the couples because she is best friends with the bride's mother Alice Pratt (Alfre Woodard ~ Primal Fear).As the story(?) progresses we learn the Andrea is an insufferable ingrate and a snob who barely loves her husband--which of course begs the question: why did she marry the man?  And she is at constant odds with her sister Pamela (Taraji P. Henson ~ The Curious Case of Benjamin Button).  Andrea is also having an affair with her boss William Cartwright (Cole Hauser ~ Good Will Hunting), who is in turn married to meek Jillian Cartwright (KaDee Strickland ~ Private Practice).Meanwhile, Andrea's husband Chris desperately wants to go into business for himself and constantly ribs Ben (Tyler Perry), husband of Pamela, about the prospect.  Eventually he speaks to William about it and as a result: he and Ben get fired, and the world upends...My ThoughtsAdmittedly, if it weren't for Tyler Perry movies, we would scare see some of the most talented Black American actors working, or trying to work, in Hollywood.  Because let face it, "main stream" Hollywood seems to have no place for them in its decidedly lily white world, wherein only one race has the capacity to really experience life outside of a comedy film.So it is disappointing to this Black American reviewer that Perry's movies have thus far been the same nonsense that came before; movies starting overwhelming Black actors that have to act a fool in order to make box office dollars.  "The Family That Preys," does break out of that mold by trying to offer up a dramatic turn, but fails miserably because, well, Tyler wrote it.  The story is implausible, the characters two dimensional and largely contrived along racial and gender stereotypes, and the dialog is hopeless inept and laughable at times.  It actually pained me--on the actor's behalf--to have to watch the movie.I would have hoped by now that Perry had established enough credibility to start turning our Black American programing with depth and purpose; stories that show Black people as three dimensional being capable of exhibiting the full range of human emotion, but The Family That Preys is not that movie!Now I love, love, love me some Sanaa  Latham, have ever since Love & Basketball, but The Family That Preys should be left off her cinematic resume!  Yes the movie is just that bad!  And as usual the antiheroes (Andrea and William) are very bad, and the good guys (Chris and Ben) are very noble and trusting (Chris)--until they--he (Chris)--gets mad and strikes his wife.The Perry formula (preachy, pandering, gospel-laden, soap with more than an ounce of ignorance thrown in for good measure), is well worn at this point and its time Perry tried something new.  But, why should he, since his dedicated core audience comes back for more time and again!The one good thing about The Family That Preys, other than just seeing Sanna, was Gladys Knight's soul-stirring rendition of the Lee Ann Womack classic I Hope You Dance in the closing credits, it was superb!

$REVIEW.: This movie is a marketing scheme which was lifted up at the last minute to keep the majority of Americans 'in check' who were possibly frightened of liking a movie about love between two people who just happen to be men. Come on, this movie won BEST MOVIE of 2006 and it is selling for less than $10 bucks? Do you know why? Our beloved Amazon is just passing the savings from the studio on to you, so they are innocent in this scheme. The studio priced this movie to sell cheap so they could move a lot of DVDs and proclaim it outsold Brokeback Mountain and even Walk the Line, which was a great movie too. I think it's more the mind-controlling fundies who probably had a hand in that, but I'm not here to start preaching. This movie was ok. I liked the fact it tried to explore the deeper psyche of prejudice, and found it ironic that in doing so it became movie of the year so people would not have to face their own prejudice against homosexuals, or love that does not 'fit in the box'. As this movie explored deep seeded situations where we face our own racial prejudice....which is from all sides, I might add, American society remains ignorant to their own prejudice not against homosexualty, because any type of love felt by most but not talked about, discussed or even faced. Love is love. And that message is much stronger than the message of Crash, which was hate is hate. You decide which DVD to buy, and which message should have won best picture for 2006. In closing, what I'm loving at this moment is that no matter how the studio has priced Crash....both Brokeback Mountain and Walk the Line are outselling it. America does have a voice!

This Wrestlemania was treated as an angle advancement it was just a booking like The Royal Rumble & I know I'm sure there's a lot of you out there that love The Attitude Era I do too but just cause something happened in The Attitude Era doesn't make automatically awesome
Austin vs Rock is a good a match & that's it the rest of the card is a mess

If you're new to this I have been reviewing old Wrestling Pay Per Views for the past 2 & half years I started with WCW stuff from 1988-1994 & have reviewed WWF Pay Per Views from Survivor Series 1995 up till now

These reviews are mainly for people like me that grew up watching The Attitude Era although I know I have made a lot of fanboys mad cause I don't like this Pay Per View

The Rock gave Tim White a Rock Bottom Vince McMahon knocked out Earl Hebner


Mankind returned to the arena to officiate the match

After Austin won he had a beer bash


When Austin leaving McMahon was yelling at Austin that he has his belt


Austin punched McMahon & then put him in the ring & gave him a Stunner

He poured beer all over Vince.This is from The VHS so their was bonus interviews with The Rock & AustinThe Rock said he lost the title but he's still The People's Championhe gave Austin no credit & said he still thinks he's Trailer Park Trash.Austin said The Rock gave it his all but he did what he planed on doing getting The WWF title back & he said this title reign is going to be harder on McMahon.Final thoughts Austin vs The Rock was good the rest of the card blows
The HIAC was poor


The New Age Outlaws going for different titles was dumb


Billy Gunn was chasing IC title since December & Road Dogg came back from injury to chase The Hardcore title


Billy Gunn goes for The Hardcore title loses at Mania

Road Dogg goes for The IC title & loses the night after Wrestlemania

Mediocre European title match it was part of a booking to turn Triple heel


Kane vs HHH was ok
The Brawl For All was classic Wrestlecrap


Big Show vs Mankind was just angle advancement


The Women's title match was what it was

The Tag Team title match was another poor match

How did Vince Russo get away with this cause McMahon has the final say on everything


Good match between The Rock & Austin although it's their weakest match imo


The rest is just an angle advancement show.So the good old days weren't always good.

$REVIEW.: "Gladiator" is loosely based on a Hispano-Roman general from the Roman province of Hispania (Russell Crowe as Maximus). Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula (now Spain and Portugal). Under the Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed Callaecia (or Gallaecia - modern Galicia in NW Spain). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the vicarius for the Hispaniae (the Celtic provinces). The name Hispania was also used in the period of Visigothic rule. The modern name Spain derives from Hispania.

$REVIEW.: A must-see masterpiece, "Mysterious Skin" is Gregg Araki's brave, brilliant and soul-shattering film about that touchiest of all subjects - pedophilia.  Based on the novel by Scott Heim, "Mysterious Skin" is brutally frank and honest in its approach to the topic, forcing us to face the issue head-on without comforting filters and without concern for offending audience sensibilities.  Yet, it is a supremely humane film, illuminating the darkest corners of its characters' psyches in an effort to help us better come to terms with the devastating consequences of this sadly all-too-common tragedy.Set in a small town in Kansas in the early 1980's, the story focuses on two seemingly unrelated youngsters:  Neil, who knows he's gay at a very young age and turns to male prostitution at the age of 15, and Brian, who starts experiencing strange, unaccounted-for "blackouts," which he naively attributes to his being abducted by UFOs.  But the boys share a far more sinister past, inextricably linked together by a molestation experience that continues to haunt them and that has marked and scarred them in radically different ways.Because of its refusal to flinch at or turn away from the sordid reality of its subject matter, "Mysterious Skin" is not a film everybody will be able to sit through.  It is ugly and harsh and almost impossible to watch at times, for there is no denying that what it shows us is deeply and profoundly disturbing and that it disgusts and offends us - as indeed it should - at the very core of our beings as humans.  Yet this is no cheesy exploitation film, but rather a heartfelt and compassionate work of art that makes us see the horror of the situation in a truly empathetic way.  We come to care very deeply for these boys as we are forced to see what it is they're going through and to share in their pain.Moreover, Heim and Araki have populated their world with unforgettable characters, all beautifully enacted by first rate performers: Michelle Trachtenberg as Neil's closest friend, Wendy, the one anchor of support Neil can count on to always be there for him even in his darkest moments; Jeffrey Licon as Eric, a gay teen with a warm heart whose unrequited love for Neil provides some of the most touching moments of the film; Mary Lynn Rajskub as a sad and lonely young woman also convinced that she has been abducted by aliens and who reaches out to Brian in love and friendship; Elizabeth Shue as Neil's well-meaning but tragically self-centered mother whose carelessness in leaving Neil alone with his coach is the catalyst that gets the tragedy rolling; and Bill Sage, in a very brave turn  as the coach himself,  whose actions have far-reaching consequences for both the boys involved.  Without exception, all these actors, including the ones playing Neil and Brian  as children, turn in mesmerizing, stellar performances.But the real acting honors go to Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet, two extraordinary young men who, as Neil and Brian, make a tremendous mark on our hearts.  Gordon-Levitt, in particular, is phenomenal in capturing the many moods of his character, beautifully conveying the sweet innocence that lies so deeply buried under a harsh, unemotional exterior that even his closest friends have a hard time locating it.  Corbet is also terrific as the nerdish Brian, a good-natured lad who slowly but surely comes to remember and understand the devastating event that has shaped and defined his life.The movie shows how, in Neil's case, the early childhood experience has made it impossible for him to view sex as anything but a "business transaction," thus explaining his turn towards prostitution.  He acts out his anger and confusion by indulging in self-destructive behaviors and by shutting himself off from any kind of rich emotional attachments with anyone other than his platonic friend Wendy.  Brian, for his part, has responded by becoming, essentially, asexual, a means of subconsciously recoiling from the personal violation that occurred to him as a child and of avoiding having it ever happen to him again.  Their final scene together, in which long-festering wounds are at last opened and the "healing" begun, is devastating and unforgettable in its power and intensity.For, despite the darkness of the subject matter, "Mysterious Skin" is, finally, an optimistic, hopeful film, one that acknowledges the power of self-acceptance in making a fractured person whole again.  Beautifully written and directed by Araki, "Mysterious Skin" provides a heartbreaking experience that will burrow its way into the deepest recesses of your heart and stay with you for a very long time.  It is one of the few truly great films of the past several years, a complete work of art.  See it.

$REVIEW.: After seeing what was spent on this movie I am pretty impressed with the final results.  There are three stories told in this zombie movie.  You have a guy and his wife living in an apartment with the guy always typing on his computer and basically ticking his wife off.  You have two vampires looking for their next meal and finally you have the a woman protecting a young man in the third setting.  The vampire story and the woman protecting the young man were the stronger of the two stories.This movie is worth a watch.  It was pretty short and the camera work could have been better but all in all I thought it was a good movie.  It would have been interesting to see what these guys could do with some real money. The special effects are pretty decent.  There are a bunch of zombies in this movie which is good.  Anyway check it out.  You wont be to disappointed if you dont go into this thinking it is going to be the greatest thing in the world.Side rant coming up.  If you can do better please do.  These movies are made with no budget so to speak and are made to the best of the film makers ability.  I have nothing to do with this film but can see the effort put into the thing.  While everyone has the right to rip apart whatever they want, you need something to back it up with other then I just wasted two hours of my life.  I can come up with big budget movies that I can say this to as well.  Regardless, it is a good effort if you go into it realizing that there was no major budget.

$review_text.: If you've been listening to Stern over the years or have heard his outrageous show and have been stunned, shocked, aroused, amused etc.
then this will not fail to touch you in those key areas


This movie is an autobiography which follows Stern from childhood to radio God


 I've been listening to the show daily for over 5 years now and only watched this film a few months ago

It is a amazing to see how much the shows content and the personalities have changed over that period
Stern ain't married to Allison anymore

Stuttering john has gone to do his thing with Leno
Robin has gained a little weight
Howard's lost some
Pig Virus has gone, but dead air dave and Tom Chiusano is still making Howards life a misery.Booey wasn't in the film much, and Fred didn't say a word as usual
The acting was great by all involved, especially Paul Giammati who played Pig Virus and Howard Stern who played himself, of course.Looking forward to Sirius Radio

$REVIEW.: In this "review", I won't address the movie itself since I would imagine the only ones reading about it are fans.  This is mainly about this DVD-R release.I just received this title as a gift and am happy to report that it is in Widescreen and not in Pan & Scam!  The case does not specify the aspect ratio, it only says "Widescreen", but judging by the size of the black bars on my 16x9 screen it does appear to be presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  I'm also happy to report that I did not experience any video problems as some have reported some time ago.  Hopefully this means that the problems have been fixed.The video quality is good to very good as viewed on my 60" screen; not the best DVD I've seen, but certainly not the worst either.  Audio quality is OK.  Overall there is nothing really wrong to detract from enjoying the movie.There are a couple quirks that are worth mentioning.  For one, there is no menu and the movie just starts automatically when loaded in the DVD player.  Also, at the end of the movie (after the credits) the movie just starts over again from the beginning.Considering the difficulty in finding this title on DVD, I would recommend this DVD-R release to any fan of this movie.

$review_text.: Many say 'Sideways' is a funny comedy, and that is not without truths

 But for anyone who knows something about so-called mid-life crisis, this film means much more than being a well-made comedy

 In short, 'Sideways' is a bitter-sweet tale about the life -- life with regrets and a little bit of hope -- and as that it is fantastic.Nothing remarkable happens in 'Sideways.'  One English teacher (and recently divorced) Miles (Paul Giamatti) travels with his friend Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) around California tasting good Californian wine, playing golf, and having a double date with two women Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh)

 Jack was a popular TV star (and an occasional TV commercian narrator) who is getting married in a week, and for him this is the last chance to be really 'free.'  In the menawhile, Miles has his own concern because he wants to be a writer though none of the publishers he submitted his manuscript wouldn't accept it, not even give a call to him

 And Miles vaguely senses that success is eluding him.Nothing more attractive than the written story, but these characters and their emotions are so real, so amusing and often so painful that the film becomes a tour to get to know these people, whose virtues and even flaws start to look very adorable

 Jack is a hopeless case of womamizer, but we understand his personality, if not tolerate
 Miles ia haunted by the perpetual self-loathing habit, and we know it when he calls his ex-wife, asking if there could be a second chance
 Of course, there is not, we know it, and he knows it
 But he had to phone, and ask, and hates himself for doing that.Though wine plays the integral part of the film, it does so not with some knowledge about vintages, but with a slyly concealed allegory about life
 I cannot reveal the part in detail, but at one scene, which virtually brought an Oscar nomination to Virginia Madsen, Miles and Maya talk about something in the candle-lit room
 Apprantly Miles talks about wine


 But we soon know Maya's answer to him means much deeper Miles initially suspected

 Don't miss this part, for this is one of the most touching moments in the movie history

 Surely Ms
Madsen deserves an Oscar nomination.As every good comedy is ultimately talking about life, 'Sideways' is also about life
 A life that you think could be different, which could be still OK


 This film is such a precious experience to teach us that.

$review_text.: From the opening panoramic scenes of a seaport village in southern Italy where Wehrmacht soldiers are enjoying some r&amp;r, to their long train ride through Russian farmland to their ultimate destiny in Stalingrad, we  are witness to the beginnings of a visually stunning and spectacularly well  made film. Director Vilsmaier's cameras are always at ground level to  establish intimacy.The attention to detail is also remarkable. Authentic  weapons, uniforms, vehicles, setting and buildings, you name it. In this  way, it is very similar to both Das Boot and Saving Private Ryan. Some  folks question the use of newer T-34/85 Russian tanks in the film as  opposed to the older T-34/76 models. I think it should be understood that  the Germans, both on offense and in retreat, destroyed Russian armor in  great numbers, and it is unlikely that older serveable tanks have survived.  The T-34/85 was in use long after WW2 ended.What lets the film down  somewhat is its portrayal of German senior officers as sadistic martinets,  bereft of any humanity or compassion. Yet the Russians are portrayed often  as helpless, innocent and frightened victims, quite an oversimplification  considering the reality of the Eastern Front during WW2.But scenes of  soldiers caught in the frigid, snowy landscapes of Stalingrad are  unforgetable. It cecomes evident that it was the winter, the worst in 100  years, that defeated the Germans, not the Russians. The ending of the film  with Fritz and Von Witzland huddled and dying in the driving snow is  profoundly sad.Just some comments about the DVD. All you get are basic  features; theatrical trailer, brief bio's and language selection. The video  quality is ok, but not remarkable. My biggest gripe is that, considering  what you pay for this DVD, you cannot view the scene number you are  watching or the time elapsed on your DVD player.All nitpicking aside,  this is still an excellent war film and should be a welcome addition to  anyone's war film collection.

$REVIEW.: This is one of those movies that focuses on real life situations and gives you real life characters. It's the first of all the Judd Apatow-style R-rated comedies.This is a believable story about those guys, like me, who are very shy towards women and always seems to act foolish around them. Steve Carell stars as Andy, a regular guy who keeps to himself, but enjoys his loneliness. It is when his coworkers out of the blue invites him to a poker game that his life begins to change. The guys, everyone has friends like these, find out about his lack of sexual encounters and feels they have to help Andy. Each guy has their own advice about approaching women and we see the hilarious results of their advice. Andy does finally meet someone who he truly cares about played by Catherine Kenner and the fun really begins.This is truly a very funny film. The laughs keep coming and never let up.  40 Year Old Virgin is in the vein of "There's Something About Mary." I was also surprised how touching the movie turned out to be. Really felt true to life for this guy. Believe me I went through some experiences Andy went through, and I'm sure there are many who have been in Andy's shoes.Highly recommend this must see non-stop comedy.

$review_text.: How wonderful that I should happen upon this movie one early summer evening not so very long ago - and that it should brighten the wettest, most overcast June immemorial!Director Trevor Nunn set this  Shakespeare play in the Victorian era, and his adaptation is overflowing  with talent - Imogen Stubbs (Viola) shows herself to be a versatile actress  who can brilliantly play this complex lead with ease!  Also notable were  Nigel Hawthorne (Malvolio), Toby Stephens (Orsino), Helena Bonham Carter  (wonderful as Olivia, although I'd expected it as I've never seen her  performances as anything less), Richard E

Grant (Sir Andrew Aguecheek),  and Imelda Staunten (Maria) -- and Ben Kingsley (the fool, Feste) did such  a magnificent job - and, incidently, he sings superbly - he would easily  have stolen the show if it weren't for the flawless performances of the  entire cast!I had to give it four stars instead of five because it was  very hard to follow what was being spoken much of the time
 I actually had  to pull out my &quot;Riverside Shakespeare&quot; to follow what was being  said
 Much of this movie is verbatim directly from the play itself - which  I must say endears it further into my heart.In the midst of a summer  where, at least here in my little realm of the earth, it &quot;raineth  every day,&quot; a movie such as this eases the doldrums


 This movie is a  delight!

SEX-E characters done by Victoria Pratt(Shalamar on Mutant X and also played on John Woo's Once A Theif),Gina Torres(Shield, Matrix, Angel, and many more), and Jennifer Sky(bombshell blond who also played on Charmed, Hercules, and I'm pretty certain on Xena, and more)
They fight evil machines in what appears to be most similar to The Matrix meets the Terminator

People hiding underground fighting cyborgs bent on killing all human beings while machines run the surface of Earth
Although not as tough or gritty as Terminator or Matrix, there is a LOT of lasers and shields being put to use in this series
Once again however, I think the main thing about this series was/is the raw sex appeal of these very well built ladies! Lots of sci-fi action, a little comedy on Sky's part, and hotties galore baring their midrifts and shoulders for those blasted cyborgs to see IS Cleopatra 2525


Although not Star Wars or a rated R movie, if you like your sci-fi charged with sex appeal, THIS IS IT


Better than all others

 These 3 ladies are HOT
Worth the price for the show!

$REVIEW.: There are now quite a few films about Maria Callas on the market. This is probably on of the better ones, but nevertheless it still suffers, like the rest of them, by the fact that very little visual material has been released about Callas. Officially, there is the second act of Tosca, both from Paris and London, plus a few recitals. The recitals are interesting to a point but hardly exemplify Callas's strong point, which was her marvellous acting on the stage. Act 2 of Tosca, especially from Covent Garden is electrifying. She may have lost a lot on her high notes (listen to her legendary 1954 recording for EMI, with di Stefano, Gobbi and with de Sabata conducting) but the performance puts any other video portrayals of Tosca that exist today, well below her. There are the usual biographical notes about her birth in New York, her war years in Athens, her marriage to Meneghini, her relationship with Onassis and her final sad years in Paris. But one feels there is something lacking. For example, I know there are short video clips of her Lisbon Traviata and of her Norma at la Scala, which are missing.One wanders at times how much material actually exists and is not published for some reason or other. I remember watching as a young boy in 1965 a BBC television broadcast in London, of her last Tosca complete, i.e. all three acts, during the gala performance attended by Queen Elisabeth. What happened to that? One also wanders why her great friends and great film directors Visconti and Zeffirelli never produced any films of her operas, but that is a different story.There is a DVD about the life of Herbert von Karajan by Robert Dornhelm. It is similar to Tony Palmer's film, in having interviews with people he worked with and with performance material, but it is presented in a much more sensitive and in a "musical" way. One fine touch, which to me exemplifies the contrast between the two directors, Palmer and Dornhelm, is the last musical piece presented in each film. Dornhelm ends his film with Wagner's Liebestod from Tristan and Isolde, a musical piece that expands your senses and leaves you in a mythical world. Palmer's film ends with "o mio babbino caro", a beautiful area by Puccini, but nothing of the impact of the Liebestod and not something Callas was renown for. Something like Cast Diva from Norma would have been, in my humble opinion, far more fitting for an ending of a film about Callas, to leave you with thoughts to ponder. Also, we get again and again the music from the tenor's last aria in act 3 of Tosca "e lucevan le stele". A tremendous romantic piece of music, one of Puccini's best, but nonetheless an aria for a tenor not a soprano!Having said all that, yes I do recommend this film and if you are interested about Callas it is definitely worth buying.

$REVIEW.: "Decline of the American Empire" is a difficult movie to define, mainly because it straddles both European and New World cinematographic tendencies (i.e., ponderous and talky on the one hand, ponderous and talky about sex on the other).  Briefly, it's the story of four or five friends who, with one exception, discover that their relationships are in decline -- disintegrating because they come to know more and more about themselves and their lovers.  Is it supposed to be some complex metaphor that somehow ties back in to the movie's title?  That's never really clarified.  But the dialogue is fun (Quebecois French, English subtitles), and the characters aren't sympathetic enough to make you feel sorry for them, so you can, in a detached way, enjoy their suffering in this offbeat comedy drama farce.

$REVIEW.: I saw this movie for free, as a friend of mine (for reasons I cannot fathom) bought it and loaned it to me, knowing that I am a huge fan of the Indiana Jones movies.  I can understand someone thinking that a similar film might appeal to me, but when that film is absolute crud ... well.  I knew that both this film and the one which preceded it (which I have mercifully not yet seen) were both based on video games, but this was not necessarily a bad thing: after all, &quot;The Pirates of the Carribean&quot; was based on an amusement park ride, and yet the movie was still very enjoyable (of course, that movie had some truly talented artists working behind it, such as Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp).  But perhaps that particular movie was an exception to the rule ... it's very possible that movies based on video games/rides/other sorts of not-exactly-literate entertainment generally aren't that great (but it would be nice if they were). But what exactly were my problems with this movie?  I've got a list of them, and here they are in no particular order:The first complaint that comes to mind for this has to do with the music.  Though it wouldn't be so bad if we heard it just a time or two, the &quot;theme music&quot; for this movie, a sort of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;-style sweeping orchestra piece, gets pretty danged irritating the fortieth or so time we hear it.Second, there's Lara Croft's outfits.  They aren't practical adventuring gear ... they're obviously costumes.  That's the vibe I got right away, when first we saw her jetskiing in that skin-tight silver thing.  She's an archaeologist, not a model, for crying out loud!  Not only that, but Angelina Jolie, in spite of how well she pulled off the British accent, seemed totally phony and unbelievable in the role.  She was more an archetype than a real person ... a glamorous British adventurer simply going through the moves.  The character did nothing for me.Third, the action and flow of the film struck me as nothing more than a series of incidents or set-pieces ... one cool action moment after another, repeated ad nauseum, from a hardly thrilling skydive to a motercyle ride on top of the Great Wall of China to a dozen more ... It's not exciting in the least, and only inspired for me eye-rolling tedium.  It made me wonder &quot;what's next&quot; as each scene went by, and not in a good way.While the action was up to that point meant to be realistic, the whole climax of the film involving the tree creatures guarding the treasure of Pandora's Box, along with the Escher-style caves the box is kept in really came out of nowhere, inspiring the question &quot;what the heck is that all about&quot; rather then, &quot;wow, cool!&quot;.  One thing I like now, I realize, about &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (which is quite possibly my all-time favorite movie, I should now mention) is that it gave us hints of the supernatural throughout the film, without actually throwing us into a situation where the supernatural was undeniably at work until the very end.  This movie, unfortunately, keeps us (tenuously, I admit) in the real world until the bit toward the end, and the change is quite jarring and feels totally artificial.I really didn't care for &quot;Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life&quot;, and so I really cannot recommend it.  If anyone out there can enjoy this, more power to them, I say, but I honestly believe that a healthy dose of Indiana Jones administered through a viewing of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; or &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; will immediately cure anyone of their desire to see this film again.  It saddens me to know that while another Indy film seems next to impossible to get off the ground, films like this are in the meantime somehow being released and making people like me always more aware of what the movie-viewing public is really missing out on.Carry on Carry on,MN

$review_text.: I held out as long as I could but was forced to watch this anticipated mess by my teenage son

 Even he didn't like it
 Sure, Zoe Saldana is easy on the eyes and she comes pretty close to being nekked, but really?  I had a hard time buying this lithe young woman of about 90 pounds being able to take out swarms of bad guys
 She does it mostly with guns and other explosive weapons, a couple of which are bigger than she is


 Anyway, Cataleya (Saldana) is named after a type of orchid

 She manages to find time to leave a signature of this at each of her professional kills.As a girl of about 10, she sees her parents gunned down in Columbia by the head of a local cartel
 She escapes the killing, not by getting away quickly, but by waiting at the kitchen table until the cartel squad leader comes in and tries to negotiate with her instead of shooting her
 Now she decides to escape, but not without stabbing him in the hand

 The girl then dodges all of the acrobatic goons in a series of parkour rooftop chases


 The girl manages to get to the American Embassy in Bogot&aacute; and trades a microchip for safe passage to Miami

 Once in Miami, she escapes her handler and gets to Chicago somehow to find her uncle


 Yeah, I know


 Uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) is a mob enforcer

 Young Cat (Amandia Stenberg) wants to be a trained killer


 Uncle Emilio wants her to go to school first, and then become a killer


 To prove his prowess as a killer himself, he demonstrates outside the school

 As a Lincoln Towncar comes cruising down the street, Emilio pulls out his trusty .45 and shoots at the car which careens into a fire hydrant.As a grownup we see Cataleya plow into a police car at about 50 mph, pretending to be a drunk driver


 This so she can be arrested and placed in the same jail that will soon contain one of the guys responsible for her parents death


 My head is starting to hurt now

 Director Olivier Megaton, no stranger to bad movies ("Transporter 3"), empties the budget and explosive warehouse in the final act which is just as ludicrous as the entire film.The Blu ray transfer looks terrific


 Much of the film was shot on location in Mexico (subbing for Columbia), Chicago and New Orleans
 The DTS-HD surround is excellent

 When all hell breaks loose, the surrounds and sub snap to attention.

He immediately begins terrorizing his family and the servants living there. After whipping his female cousin senseless, Kurt is killed in his own room under mysterious circumstances. He is buried in the castle crypt and everyone can breathe easily again. Soon however, after a series of seemingly supernatural events, the family begins to wonder if Kurt has returned from the grave. Then, the murders begin. Director, Mario Bava (BLACK SUNDAY, BLACK SABBATH) creates a haunting atmosphere of madness, vengeance and doom. Lee is a towering figure, perfect for this wonderfully eeevil and intimidating role! Brilliant...

$review_text.: The poor reviews this movie has received I feel are totally unwarranted. This is my favorite non-"Christmas Carol" put to film Dickens adaption, and I am waiting (trying to be patient) for this to be available on DVD (anybody listening out there? VHS is gone - DVD is the new genre!).Now, in this version, I love the prequel. I think it makes this a much more comprehensive movie and gives the characters involved (especially Monks) much more depth.The acting is as good, if not better, than pretty much any period epic I have seen. The actors play off of each other well - they match their roles perfectly. The costumes and sets are excellent. They have captured the early Victorian period so well it's almost as if the viewer is peering through a looking glass into the past.As for the story following Dickens' original novel, well, I have yet to see any movie follow a novel to a "T." (Well, "Gods and Generals" maybe, but even that got panned for being too accurate!). But this follows the original, as a whole, much much closer than the other versions I have seen - definitely more than "Oliver," and infinitely more than the Disney version with Richard Dreyfuss, which was made into a totally different story than what Dickens had written.Because of the length of this version that I am reviewing, it allows the viewer to get to know each character much deeper than the others, as well. But, don't let the nearly 6 hour length scare you off - there is no time during this whole version where one is bored (unless they are a child - definitely not a children's movie!). Being a fan of epic period movies, I found this to be as enticing as any other epic novels put to the screen. and I am highly anticipating the day when I find this to be available on DVD!

$REVIEW.: this Anime is in a class of stories that isnt quite for all viewers. First off the story begins slowly to enable viewers to learn who the characters are, onc  that happens then the REAL story telling starts. This isnt the cutsie saturday morning story for the kids, its a story made for older viewers. Its a story with deep issues such as racism (done in the form of hatred for an alien race), it also deals with life choices and how we hav  to live with them. Bottom line is Rahxephon is romantic tale about first loves, and how they stay with you for life. The story is told with the backdrop of a war between the people of earth and an alien race called Mulians. The Mulians have taken over Japan, sealing it inside a time bubble where the difference of time passage is slow for those inside. those outside of the bubble life weeks for just a few hours passage of time for those inside. This time differance sets up the story for the main characters. Boy and Girl meet in school, Boy and girl fall in love. She moves away with jer family, and then the aliens invade. Since she lives outside the bubble, when boy and girl meet again she is now an adult, while her lost love is still teenager. They must cope with the passage of time that has occured all while the war against the alien wages. Also knowing all the while that the boy is the pilot of the mecha that is the earths only hope. But keep in mind the boy is also the offspring of the leader of the aliens. This story is told with numerous twists and turns of various sorts, dramatic, romantic, comedic, an  more. I think the characters o  the story ar  compelling, interesting and worth watching. However this is a VERY complex anime, and is not one I would advise for the inexperienced anime viewer. If you are a first timer or not much anime experience I advise trying something like Last Exile, or maybe Cowboy Bebop. However if you lik  your stories complex, deep, and with a large cast of characters then this is one for you.

$REVIEW.: The Expendables was supposed to be a throwback to 80's and 90's action films, but for whatever reason has always looked like something that, due to budget and location, was meant for the DTV world. Lame jokes. Stiff acting. Dumbed-down plots. You say, isn't that what 80's and 90's action movies were known? Well, sure, but they did them in a way that wasn't self-parody. The Expendables IS self-parody and this latest entry was an abomination. Avi Lerner is the King of Low-Budget DTV fare and has brought that over to theatrically released films. This was a perfect action cast thrust into a poorly plotted, truncated time-wise (90 min or so for that many characters?), lop-sided film. The draw was Jean-Claude Van Damme going up agains Sly Stallone. A &#34;love letter to martial arts fans&#34; as Stallone was quoted as saying. Well, a six minute end fight, poorly doubled and choreographed with Van Damme is hardly a &#34;love letter.&#34; The rest of the movie is okay, but the groans really come with the most thrown together, incoherent ending I've seen. All these beloved action heroes quoting each other's famous lines from other movies, many badly timed, and one lame joke after another. Action fans deserved better. Only the insanely large cast gets this 3 stars. As a movie, it probably is 1-2 stars. The blu-ray has minimal extras. If you want to see what extras should be like, pick up the director's cut of the first film.

$review_text.: Great western.  Magnificent scenery (where was this filmed?) and beautiful photography.  A young cowhand (played by Glenn Ford) ends up the spread of a kindly rancher who is a good man (played by Ernest Borgnine).  The young cowboy becomes the focus of the rancher's wife (played by Valerie French).  Ford's character is not responsive because of his gratitude and respect for the rancher.  He instead develops an innocent romance with a young woman who is part of a wagon train of highly religious pilgrims.  Meanwhile another cowhand (Rod Steiger) who once had a fling with the rancher's wife jealously starts stirring the waters further by spying and filling the rancher's ears with poison.  For me the best character is the rancher's wife.  As played by French you feel sympathy for this woman who through her own fault is stuck in a loveless (for her) marriage and is trying to find real love.  Sadly her husband truly loves her, though he is a lout albeit lovable.  Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Easily my favorite of all eight movies.LOVE the Harry Potter series. Never thought I'd say that, being the Christian girl who wrote a scathing paper on the evils of Harry Potter, promoting the occult to youth and blah, blah, blah. I read over that paper I ACTUALLY SUBMITTED TO A COLLEGE PROFESSOR and wanted to go back in time and slap that girl into reality.A Potterhead friend practically begged me to give the series a chance, and it is easily my favorite book series, next to Chronicles of Narnia. I am awaiting the day my 19 month old son is ready for me to read chapter books with him; because this will be our first! The tale woven throughout each of the seven books (eight movies) is one of true, genuine, sacrifical, loving friendship, not only standing up but also FIGHTING for what you believe in (especially when that belief is on the side of good), wins and losses and giving everything you have because it's the right thing to do. I just cannot praise these books enough. If you're on the fence about whether or not you'd want to bother with a &#34;young adult/kid&#34; series... just stop. Crack open a used (but very loved) copy of Sorcerer's Stone and GET. SWEPT. UP. in one of the greatest stories of bravery and perseverance and love and --geez, I should stop-- LIFE ever told. Or watch the first movie. And then the second... and all the rest. You'll be so angry you never received a letter from Hogwarts on your 11th birthday,  JUST LIKE THE REST OF US!
$SUMMARY.: if you haven't seen these movies yet, IT'S TIME!!!

$REVIEW.: Rent is loosely based on Puccini's opera,Puccini - La Boh&egrave;me / Freni, Pavarotti, Harwood, Ghiaurov, Karajan. In the opera's opening scene, the artists, musicians, and bohemians are torching their scripts, novels, and sheet music for heat because they are poor, desperate, and freezing. Ditto for the denizens of Rent. Update to Manhattan's Lower East Side, pre 9/11, pre gentrification, post AIDS; slight change to drug addict, stripper, musician, film maker, drag queen, performance artist, lesbian lawyer, gay philosophy professor, and yuppie developer, and voila! Rent: a film of a Broadway musical that took Broadway by storm in 1996.Aspiring filmmaker (Anthony Rapp), and Roger, an aspiring songwriter (Adam Pascal), find out they owe a year's RENT to Benny Coffin III (Taye Diggs), a former friend, now a yuppie developer with dreams of gentrifying. He had promised them free residence when he married the landlord's daughter, but now is pressuring them to stop a protest of evicting the homeless from a nearby property. Exotic dancer Mimi (Rosario Dawson), inexplicably has the hots for Roger, even though he never seems to actually finish writing a song. Mark's former girlfriend, performance diva Maureen (Idina Menzel), has found a new romance in a lawyer named Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Philosophy professor Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) finds his soul mate in drag queen Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia).Directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Widescreen Edition)) who felt that though the Broadway version was 10 years old, a lot of the original cast could still carry their roles. All but two of the film's cast are from the original Broadway cast. Some of the songs are removed to make way for more dialogue, but the songs are still integrated into the movie in a clever way. The Broadway version was sung throughout, like a Rock Opera. In the film they sometimes break into song suddenly, with no warning, as in the scene where Maureen, the performance artist, and Joanne, her new girlfriend, have a commitment ceremony. It highlights her flamboyant personality, and the trouble that Joanne is having dealing with her flirtatiousness. The shock is also palpable on their respective parents, who seem OK with it, but are really pushed to their limits (I like to picture Lynne & Dick Cheney as Maureen's parents).But mostly the songs develop very naturally, and almost evolve from spoken to sung as the emotions heighten, as in the seductive "Light My Candle" sung by Mimi to Roger, or they grow out of actual performances in the context of the action, as in "Out Tonight" which begins with Mimi's dance routine. One of the best lines is from "Candle" where Roger says she looks familiar, and then Mimi says she is a dancer at the Cat Scratch Club. "I didn't recognize you without the handcuffs," he sings.The musical was written by Jonathan Larson. Tragically, he died just before his show could be staged, of an aortic aneurysm. In some bonus footage he is shown proclaiming that he wants to write the "Hair of the `90s." He also received some support and encouragement from Steven Sondheim. Though RENT is noWest Side Story (Full Screen Edition), it shows a lot more innovation thanMoulin Rouge! (Widescreen Edition), in its attempt to revitalize the Musical form. That movie took familiar songs and recast them as plot stepping stones. RENT can at least claim that original music and lyrics were written specifically for it.For me, it was interesting to speculate how the film's cast and the people that Jonathan Larson was writing about were related. If their characters were gay, were the actors portraying them also gay? I wondered if Larson pictured himself as Roger, or perhaps more of Mark, the film maker? (Wouldn't it have been great to have Andy Dick in this role, Anthony Rapp's fine performance notwithstanding?) Maybe he most closely identified with Angel? An interesting bit of trivia was that Larson supported himself as a waiter at the Moondance Caf&eacute;, and later, Jesse L. Martin also worked there as a waiter, even being trained under Larson. His character, the philosophy professor Tom Collins, was very gay, and I wondered about him. He has played Dr. Greg Butters, love interest forAlly Mcbeal: The Complete DVD Collection [Region 2 Import], and also plays Detective Green on the long running police procedural,Law & Order - The Fourteenth Season (2003-04 Season). I once saw him along with S. Epatha Merkerson, also of L&O;, as she picked up an Emmy. Seeing him that night, with Merkerson, and two other seemingly gay men in her entourage, it really seemed like he was. An internet search could not confirm this, except at one point it said he was never married (was married to his career), didn't have a girlfriend--but then one gossip item showed him out on the town with Cynthia Nixon, of Sex & the City.Also dating someone from Sex & the City is Rosario Dawson. She was electric in RENT, and I saw that she had quite a varied career, from independent films to blockbusters to bombs. She is from the Lower East Side, and a mix of African American, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Native American, and Irish. She was discovered sitting on a porch and asked if she wanted to be in a movie. That movie wasKids, directed by Larry Clark. Since then she has been inClerks II (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition), Sin City 2,Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition),  andJosie and the Pussycats (PG-13 Version). She has also worked with Prince and Jay-Z, as well as been romantically linked with various and sundry people. Hard to keep up with them all. Even someone from Dawson's Creek, now wouldn't that be apropos?Taye Diggs, along with Jesse L. Martin, was also a love interest on Ally McBeal. He was linked to Ling Woo (Lucy Liu), and he was also not only a cultural reference, but also played Will Truman's love interest on a few episodes of Will & Grace. Jack makes numerous references to Taye Diggs, as in a birthday wish of someone for a hot air baloon ride over Taye Diggs' house, and he is also a prominent feature of the gay assistant's character's fantasies on Ugly Betty. His character in RENT is neither gay, nor particularly appealing as he is kind of the villain--a once idealistic friend who is now a cynical yuppie developer. It is just interesting how he has become such a cultural icon. He is even mentioned several times on Hannah Montana.What with the interesting cast, music, songs and story of RENT, I would have to say, RENT--no buy it, today!Bye-bye.
$SUMMARY.: RENT RENT, bye-bye!

$REVIEW.: This is one that I remember from my childhood and its great to see it again even as an adult  Mild-mannered Mr. Limpet, who loves the ocean and fish, makes a wish to become a fish only for his wish to come true one day when he falls into the sea and is turned into an animated fish.  He soon learns of a special ability that is called a 'thrum', he becomes an integral part of helping the U.S. Navy during WWII to find and sink enemy subs.  Filled with good clean humor, it's a classic that both young and old will enjoy and starring one of my favorite comedians, Don Knotts

$review_text.: Zulu is arguably one of the best movies ever made. Stanley Baker and Michael Caine are the main stars in this true story. The main reason why I liked the film is because of the battle scenes. Furthermore, the character development was excellent and the acting by Caine, Baker as well as the extras playing as Zulu warriors were superb. In short, if you like war movies, this is a MUST buy but if you prefer romantic ones, stay clear of this.This DVD version is in widescreen format.

$review_text.: With Battle: Los Angeles I expected a lot of CG effects and little plot. It was refreshing to find that the film concentrated more on the characters than glitzy effects.  This is a war movie. When Earth is invaded by aliens there are no questions about have they been watching us or what they want. The marines at the center of this drama are only concerned about their objective: rescuing civilians caught in the middle of the battle.Battle: Los Angeles has at its core a standard story of redemption. Sgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) led his squad on an apparent suicide mission where he was the only survivor.  He is shunned by fellow Marines as a pariah and, in the opening scene, submits a request for retirement.  When the alien attacks begin, Nantz is assigned to serve under a newly commissioned Second Lieutenant William Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez). The other members of  the platoon resent Nantz and think he would get them all killed.  This is particularly true for Corporal Jason Lockett (Cory Hardrict) whose brother was killed in Nantz's prior mission.As is standard for this kind of film, we get a brief glimpse into the lives of the characters. We discover that Lt. Martinez's wife is expecting a baby; another soldier is planning his wedding.  There is just enough information to provide a little insight.  The approach of the filmmakers was to take the point of view of a squad of soldiers.  Like them, we are unaware of what kinds of creatures have invaded Earth, what their weapons are and how the battle can be won.  Battle: Los Angeles could have been very mediocre but for the excellent performance of Aaron Eckhart. He perfectly conveys the guilt he carries for being a survivor and the ends he is willing to go through to prove himself to the squad and his lieutenant. Michael Pena plays a civilian who is rescued by the squad along with his young son, nicely played by Bryce Cass.  Brigit Moynahan is good in a small role as a vet who discovers how to kill the aliens.In all, Battle: Los Angeles will probably remind you of other war films but it has enough suspense and good performances to keep you on the edge of your seat. The CG effects are good and are not used for mindless dazzle.

$review_text.: I applaud Code Red DVD for releasing this kind of movie and adding a horror host to present them.  I have no regrets buying it, but jeez, this movie is not very good at all.  The same kill scenes are repeated, the direction of the movie is horribly inept, and it frankly hurts to watch it.  It's not a fun cheesy movie, it plain stinks.  "Night of the Demon" is much better, but that's like saying getting punched in the nuts is a little better than getting kicked in the nuts.  It all depends on your threshold for bad movies, and Mardis Gras Massacre tests it.I enjoy "Blood Feast," "Gore Gore Girls," and movies like that, but this doesn't belong in that category. It's not so bad it's funny, it's so bad it's, well, bad.Keep releasing these movies, though, Code Red, because I love collecting these strange pieces of cinema.

$review_text.: When SciFi came out with the miniseries "Dune", it was a huge improvement over David Lynch's "Dune" (which wasn't a bad movie in my opinion).  With a miniseries, one has more time to do justice to the original story.  When SciFi put out that DVD, it was a good one.  So why get this new release?First, this DVD contains an additional 30 minutes of footage not in the previous DVD or shown on SciFi.  This footage is spread over the three-disks containing the three episodes.  The additional footage adds some more depth to the characters and story and makes this DVD fall even closer to the original novel.  Also, Princess Irulan Corrino's part is expanded even more here.  While she didn't play a real part in the original novel, I liked how her character was given things to do.  This allowed for the political intrigue to play out better.The down side for me on this DVD set is the brief nudity that appears.  It wasn't shown in the original show or DVD set and isn't needed now.  However, with the way movie makers love getting women to display their breasts in the name of "art" (and to make extra bucks from [excited] guys), I guess I'm not surprised. However, this wasn't enough to make me knock down the rating a notch.Bottom line, this Special Edition DVD is better than the first and if you liked SciFi's "Dune", you will LOVE this version!  Go ahead and get it.

$review_text.: One word to describe this movie is EXCELLENT.  I know a few critics do not agree, but they don't know a good film when they see it.  Todays movies lack the sensibility as movies from decades gone by, but MEET JOE BLACK  brings substance back into a film.  Very few films that are centered around  romance and conflict are presented in an intelligence manner.  They are  either targeted towards a particular audience, such as towards the women or  towards the men, but this film can be watched by anyone.Though the  film is three hours long, those three hours go by real fast when you pay  attention to the plot lines.  I say lines because there are three events  going on at the same time:  Death on holiday(Brad Pitt) who wants to take  Bill Parrish(Anthony Hopkins) to the world beyond, the ongoing romance that  emerged with Susan Parrish(Clare Forlani) and Death--Joe Black, and the  company takeover.  Actually, there is a fourth minor plot, the finale with  Bill Parrish's Birthday gala.The music score was excellent and quite  emotional at times, but very effective.  If you love movies with meaning,  you definitely must watch MEET JOE BLACK.  You don't have to be a romantic  to enjoy this film. It'll hit your heart naturally.

$REVIEW.: Chad had earlier given another great synopsis of this last entry into the world of Pazuzu.  You might want to read any of his reviews just to get a good understanding of what went on in the movies he's reviewed.I do not disagree with him on this one as far as the quality of the film.  This film is a mess.  I always wanted to know what the previous meeting between Father Merrin and Pazuzu was like based off of the hints given us in the original Exorcist film, but this shallow film did little for me.  I think Kat's review is on the money with this flick.  If it wasn't for the good performance Stellan Skarsgard, playing Father Merrin, I would give this film a zero.  I wonder what the author of the original story thinks (or would think if he's dead) how this prequel was handled.  Only in his mind would we really know how Father Merrin really battled Pazuzu.

$REVIEW.: Everybody knows Sergio Leone's &quot;The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.&quot; Even if they only know how to humm parts of the theme music. Those who have seen it invariably rate it as something better that superb. &quot;Once Upon  A Time in the West&quot; postdates &quot;Good/Bad/Ugly&quot; and takes  everything that makes that film great and magnifies it until everything in  frame ceases to be even slightly realistic and becomes an sometimes almost  overloaded poem.For my money this film easily surpasses  &quot;Good/Bad/Ugly&quot; on several levels. When Leone made this he was at  the height of his fame and power. This meant that he could do pretty much  as he liked.Firstly, he filmed this western in the USA, his first. The  locations are nothing short of astonishing. Secondly he hired every big  name he could. Third, he indulged himself when it came to budget, sets and  production values.Lastly, he found the biggest story he could, and told  it as big as he could, and thats *big.*The shots are long. Some of them  seem to take hours. Sergio Leone takes joy in letting us watch water drip  onto a waiting badman's hat for what seems like several minutes. They are  brilliant, exciting minutes. This is a film to watch again and  again.Stay away from any Pan and Scan version of this film. &quot;Once  Upon a Time in the West&quot; was filmed by a master craftsman in  magnificent 235:1  widescreen. This film is an epic and uses every square  inch of its frame to blow your mind. Panning and Scanning it is an insult  and a straight out ripoff.Other people on this site have called this the  best western ever made. It is.Wait for the DVD.

$REVIEW.: Since most Pythons fans,have already seen this film and formed their opinion,and since this is THAT same film,I'm going to waste space here at Amazon by reviewing only the &quot;bonus materials&quot;. ( Which by-the-by,are REALLY cool.)I am happy to say John Cleese got more involved with this one,and he's a welcome sight.(Still looney after all these years.).Included on this disc are the deleted scenes! &quot;Martin Luther&quot; was a given,since it's in the script book,as is the extended &quot;Philosophy Restraunt&quot; bit with Carol Cleveland.BUT...there is a Public Service Annoucement by Terry Jones about why War is good for the economy and the Cheese Industry ( with Eric Idle interpreting in Swedish(?),plus a bit more of Mr.Creosote,a bit more of Mr.&amp; Mrs.Hendy ( Palin &amp; Idle ) and their three limbed bell boy ( Gilliam,whom has a wheel for one hand ).There is also a deleted scene of French Waiter Idle,leading us on a very lonnnnnnnng walk &amp; bus ride. There is also an option to view a &quot;directors cut&quot; which re-incorporates all of the cut scenes,back into the original film....it's a bit sloppy...but gives you the general premise....and also shows you why the scenes were cut. There is a segment featuring alternate versions of three film songs....which shows you why these were re-done.( The final versions were MUCH better.).The Virtual Python re-union is a must for Python fans waiting to see them all together again! There is also an Aquarium of fish,and what they think. ( It runs for about 20 minutes,for those who don't have the patience.).There's the John Cleese version of the trailer. There's the re-mastering of the film,in which Jones finds the masters in the trash,and Gilliam gives up and throws it all out again!There's all sorts of interviews new and old,trailers,and some funny poster designs.( Most of which Terry Jones hates.).There's also a &quot;Soundtrack for the Lonely&quot; option,in which it sounds like you have guests watching with you! Over all...the extras are a delight,and make this worth having....even if you didn't like the original film.

$REVIEW.: This series is excellent. I was impressed with the cunning of the script and the way it kept me off guard throughout the entire series. It is a screenplay that blurs the lines between an investigation of a serial killer and the two detectives that pursue that killer over a 17 year period. The character development was exceptional which has to be attributed not only to the well written and paced script but primarily to the exceptional acting of Mathew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. This may be McConaughey&#8217;s finest role to date as the viewer tries to decipher the mind and motives of this odd character that he creates on the screen. McConaughey plays Russ Cohle, a damaged but brilliant man. He is a fascinating character for his complete pessimism, cynicism, and desire for justice.  I found his complexity to be very appealing for how can a man with such cunning and intelligence, with such a dark view of the world, believe that justice can be won?  This is why he is one of the most unique of heroes for he knows that justice is hard won and a price must be paid. Woody Harrelson plays a bit more mainstream character but as the series develops viewers see the layers peel off, revealing the depths of this character that Harrelson creates. The series revolves around a terrible crime made bizarre by demonic ritualistic overtones but it is the cleverness of actors, writers, and director to ensure that the crime is the glue that holds the character development and character conflicts together. This is not Sherlock Holmes and Mr. Watson and the constant grating of these two strong personalities against each other makes for fascinating entertainment. The unfolding crime and investigation is balanced perfectly with the amazing character development of the two men who have entered this investigation together. Cinematography and art direction are excellent in this series, in fact some of the scenes are so nasty that it makes you want to take a bath.  But make no mistake, it is adult entertainment, and involves serial murders, nude bodies, alcoholism, prostitution, political and police corruption, and drugs. This series is so well done; it is hard to imagine how it could be improved.

$REVIEW.: The first Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929 stipulated many things in regard to treatment of prisoners.  The Japanese signed, yet did not ratify, this convention's stipulations; Lt. Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) continues to bring to the attention of Colonel Saito which stipulations he is violating.  Forced by his command to surrender to the Japanese, Nicholson realizes that he is there to document the prisoners' abuses which he makes all too clear to Colonel Saito.  The Bridge on the River Kwai is somewhat based on a true story, the characters are fictional.  The movie is based on a book published in 1954 by a Frenchman who was an actual POW in S.E. Asia.  There were two bridges built over the river Kwai during WWII, a part of the Death Railway which ran through Thailand into Burma where the Japanese hoped to expand their operations.  This railway did claim thousands of lives due to exhaustion, tropical diseases, malnutrition, sometimes torture as this movie hints at by the shots of many crosses shown marking the graves of soldiers who died in the camp.  Nicholson and his officers are cast into "ovens" for days on end without food or water.  The medic for the camp goes to Saito pleading for their lives and gets the comment given in the title of this review.  Nicholson is dead set on principles, and somehow manages to outwit Saito, later nearly befriending him.  The clash of the two colonels is comical at times, and, as others have noted, the movie does not realistically depict the sufferings of POWs under the Japanese.  The movie, to me, is a story of survival, honor, and wits on the part of beleaguered POWs.  Whistling while on the march, building this bridge are important actions in maintaining the soldiers' morale.  Escaping the camp, planning to blow up the bridge are others!I saw this film on TV, probably in the very early 70's with my dad, my family's war movie buff.  I've always wanted to whistle a tune like the British soldiers under Nicholson.  I've always remembered this movie.  This movie is such a classic, still so very suspenseful, no matter how many times it's seen.  Recommended!!!

$REVIEW.: Jenifer is bad news.  She's got a ton of baggage, she'll strip you of everything you own and love, she's a lousy conversationalist, and she's got weird growths on her tongue.  I don't think the great sex can make up for all the negatives when dealing with Jenifer.  Who is she?  Where does she come from, and is she human at all?  Who the hell cares?  Do you?  I sure as hell don't.  In the disc's documentary, Dario compares Jenifer to a drug, and that's a wonderful analogy for this film.  Jenifer is indeed like a drug, and Steven Weber's character acts increasingly  more and more like an addict.  Even though the evil is so blunt and apparent he just can't let her go.  She's trouble the moment he brings her into the house.  Right off the bat she's biting his wife and eating his cat(hey, that rhymed pretty good, I should think about taking up rapping).  Realistically, you'd kick this chick's [...] all the way back to the looney bin or call the cops, but Jenifer's strength is the powerful drug-like hold she has over her "owners".  Weber loses everything because of this woman and it's an interesting and disturbing journey.  Being the Argento fan I am, I was very excited about this particular installment in the Masters Of Horror series.  And I certainly wasn't disappointed.  I didn't get the full impact until a short time after the film had ended and I took time to reflect on certain aspects of the film.  I can say in all honesty, this was very well done.  In terms of style, it's more like Argento's American works like Two Evil Eyes or Trauma, though totally different at the same time.  Fans will certainly check this out without a review to prompt them.  Some will(and do) just dismiss this as gruesome, unscary and dumb, but Argento's name is bulletproof to fans, so nanny-nanny-poo-poo.  Enjoy!

$review_text.: The content on this DVD is very good, but I can't understand why it isn't presented in widescreen format like their PPV releases, since RAW has been presented in widescreen since before 2009.  If this contained footage pre-dating widescreen, I could understand.  Aside from the fullscreen format, it's a good compilation worth buying.
$review_summary.: Good DVD, but should be in widescreen format.

$REVIEW.: I must admit I am a comic book fan but not as much as I use to be. But man these people are fanatics and are bashing this movie way too much. Before I go any further I am a ghost rider fan and I own a few ghost rider comics. So what I saw in the film I thought was what I expected for ghost rider. There was some funny one liner jokes but come on it is a comic book movie. But to get to the point this film I thought had some really cool special efects and I liked the story also. This movie made me think of spawn in a way but not so campy but I liked that movie too. For me I have no complaints for this movie. In my final words I think people should check this film out fan or not of the ghost rider comic.

$review_text.: "The Young Lions" is a black & white 1958 WWII drama featuring Marlon Brando, Dean Martin (in his film debut) and Montgomery Clift.THE PLOT: The film attempts to show the German, American and French sides of the war. Brando stars as a young German officer who becomes increasingly disillusioned with Hitler's regime and the world war he started. Martin plays a worldly Broadway musician who struggles with cowardice. Montgomery Clift's character is a poor, naive Jewish American who falls in love with Hope Lange and fights the anti-semitic guys in his platoon.VARIOUS HIGHLIGHTS: I'm a huge fan of Marlon Brando and his performance in this film illustrates why. Brando is utterly captivating! 'Nuff said. Most reviewers note that Brando's German storyline is more interesting than the two American story lines, which is true, but repeat viewings grant the viewer more appreciation for the latter.There are three incredibly gorgeous women featured in the picture: Barbara Rush, May Britt and Liliane Montevecchi. Rush is Martin's marriage-minded gal, who flirts with Brando early on; Britt plays the luscious sexpot wife of Brando's captain (Maximilian Schell); and Montevecchi performs as a French girl who initially insults Brando (because he's a German occupant) yet ultimately falls for his charm.It should be pointed out that "The Young Lions" is not a war action film, but rather a powerful war DRAMA. Yes, there's quite a bit of action (France, Northern Africa, etc.), but the emphasis is on the characters and their stories. The climax involves a horrified and utterly disillusioned Brando, leaving a strong impact.FINAL WORD: If you're looking for a mindless action flick this is not the one to see. This perhaps explains some of the less-than-stellar reviews. Yet, make no mistake, "The Young Lions" is without a doubt a WAR film. It's also a masterpiece of cinematic art, not to mention one of Brando's most mesmerizing performances.GRADE A
$SUMMARY.: Outstanding War DRAMA (with Some Action)

$review_text.: The Cure "Trilogy" DVD is "Just Like Heaven" for Cure fans! To hear three landmark albums played in their running order and played so well is amazing. Moments frozen in time from three decades. So many of these songs never made it to a traditional tour stage that to hear them now is treat. Interesting too is the older Cure material played by a newer version of the line-up... fascinating.The performance is straight ahead music... these are my words and they mean something to me! Robert Smith as always is the focal point of the whole concert... and he is older just like the rest of us and a tad heavier too.The wonderful aspect is that the words, sounds, and songs hold up... the passion and emotion is there on songs 20 years old and songs 2 years old. What a tour de force.The encore set offers a stand-out rocking performance of "The Kiss" and just as the show kicks off with a haunting version of "100 Years", "The Kiss" sends the viewer/listener on their way with a blow to the mind.... awsome.There is a glut of Cure music available but if you own more than one Cure CD then  Cure fans you  need this... Older, wiser, better...

$REVIEW.: KISS KICKER!  This movie is ripoff of "Critters" which was a ripoff of "Gremlins," but you know what?  It ain't that bad.  All the other reviews that heap loads of criticism on this movie's much-maligned producer/ writer/ director/ photographer/ editor (I'm not making this up) Rick Sloane are only getting his name from the MST3K lampooning of Hobgoblins, in which they repeat his name about 100 times.  Not too original.  But, in the spirit of this third generation rip-off of "Gremlins," I guess it just comes with the territory.The story centers around five friends, one of whom is a rent-a-cop at a local warehouse.  While on "duty" (heh-heh.."doodie") the rent-a-cop accidentally releases (heh-heh "releases"...ok, I'll stop) space aliens that are obviously poorly constructed muppet-type sock puppets.  And by "poorly constructed" I mean FREAKIN' HILARIOUS!  I love the scene where they steal the rent-a-cop's go cart....I digress.  Anyway, these bad little aliens have the ability to make anyone's innermost desires come true, BUT in doing so they drain the life-force from the person, eventually killing them.  Oh yeah, and they have sharp claws and kill people that way, too.  With the hobgoblins on the loose, the five goofy friends, especially the dumb kid in the red shorts, are forced to save the ugly little corner of suburbia in which they dwell.  Oh, and they are all horny and irritating, but in a good way.This is actually an enjoyably stupid movie that really stands on its own and can give the viewer laugh after laugh, most of them unintentional.  I love the scenes at CLUB SCUM with the hilarious Master of Ceremonies performed by the massively talented DALAN NORRIS.  Whatever happened to him?  Oh, yeah and the amazing music (and Live Performance!!!) provided by the above mentioned FONTANELLES (with lead singer Spit Spignolla) is soooo bad that's it's actually quite good.  The song "Kiss Kicker" should have been a top 40 hit.  So, move your kiss kicker over to the buy button and grab one of those new copies of this hidden gem before someone else does.

$review_text.: I have been re-watching 'Grey's Anatomy' from the beginning and while I enjoyed many parts of Season Three, while re-watching the series I have discovered there are many things about Season Three I cannot stand.  First of all, this was TR Knight's most annoying season.  All of George's back-and-forth whining is annoying and makes me wish they had killed him off instead of writing Isaiah Washington off the series.George begins the season pretty affably, even likeable.  I enjoyed his courtship with Callie.  Then he became annoying when the family mess started and his dad died.  From uncharacteristically mouthiness with everyone around him, including Bailey, Burke, and even the Chief, to marrying Callie and cheating on her with Izzie.  My favorite storylines this season involved Meredith and her family (the death of her mother, the touch-and-go relationship with her father and step-mother), Christina's struggles with her relationship with Burke, and the random interactions between Bailey, Callie, Addison and Mark, Addison's almost triangle with Mark and Alex.After watching the early seasons of this series, I'm actually happy it's progressed the way it has.  This is one series that, as it has aged, has benefited from rotating cast changes.

$REVIEW.: If you love QT as much as I do, then chances are that you most likely own this DVD.  Quentin Tarantino has to be one of the most talanted movie writters/producers/directors ever.  If you are a fan, you must purchase this DVD.  It is loaded with extras and is well worth the money.  Quentin Tarantino always casts great actors and actresses like Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, John Travolta.  I highly Recommend this movie to anyone.

$review_text.: Almost four years ago, on November 17th, the 70th Anniversary Edition of GONE WITH THE WIND (1939) was released in a special 5-disc boxed set. While a Hollywood classic, GWTW is not for everyone.GWTW is not for you if:1) you think a movie must be as historically accurate as a history book;2) you think a 1939 movie should reflect the values of the 21st century;3) your attention span doesn't allow you to watch movies longer than two hours;4) you can only accept politically correct films, particularly in terms of racial issues;5) you can only accept special effects as they appear in (computerized) modern films;6) your idea of great acting is to be found only in the slasher or teen films being made today.Some find GWTW a ridiculously overblown, exaggerated re-telling of the Old South. To others, Scarlett O'Hara is nothing more than a spoiled brat who never really grows up; or, by the time she shows a glimmer of doing so, it's too late.What one should keep in mind when watching GONE WITH THE WIND: it is not a documentary. Despite the obsessive care producer David O. Selznick lavished on historical accuracy as to the "look" of the period--the clothes, the interiors--the movie is not reality, but rather an historical romance set against the bloodiest war ever fought on American soil, a war in which at least 618,000 Americans died. (Some experts say the toll reached 700,000. The number that is most often quoted is 620,000. At any rate, these casualties exceed the nation's total loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.)GWTW is a great--perhaps THE great--Hollywood example of the power of film: although battle scenes are never actually shown, the results of the war--the devastation, disease and death--are so powerfully depicted that people swear they "remember" seeing bloody combat in the movie.WITH ONE LOOK: Vivien Leigh as Scarlett, at the Atlanta church-turned-charnel house of diseased, dying and dead soldiers. With one reaction shot(see below)--her revulsion at a soldier's screams as his leg is amputated, without anesthesia--Vivien Leigh conveys the horrors--and the (never shown) bloody battles--of war.This power of film is perhaps why GWTW comes in for different criticisms. The movie is so real in its physical aspects--its "look"--that it is criticized for not being (historically) accurate in others. But, again, the movie is not a documentary. It is a m-o-v-i-e based on a novel; i.e. fiction.Not only is GWTW not a documentary on the Civil War period, it is not a history of slavery in America. It was criticized--as was the novel--for its treatment of blacks. But upon an objective viewing of the movie today, it is quite often the slaves--Mammy, Pork, Big Sam--who are the only characters with any sense. Of course, GONE WITH THE WIND, with its happy plantation slaves posed against bleeding robin's breast sunsets, has its enraging and embarrassing moments; the racist depiction is, regrettably, part of the nation's collective past.Caption: Hattie McDaniel as Mammy explaining to Melanie (Olivia de Havilland) that Rhett has locked himself in the room with his daughter Bonnie's corpse and has threatened to kill Scarlett if she buries the child.If this scene alone doesn't rip your heart out--largely due to McDaniel's performance--then pick up the phone and call the undertaker because you are most assuredly dead.Taken as cultural artifact of an earlier period of American movie-making, one has to look at it as anthropology tells us we must look at cultures not our own. That is, just as we must "judge" a culture on its own terms, we must look at a 70-year-old movie in terms of the times in which it was produced.Finally, GONE WITH THE WIND is an adaptation of a novel written by a Southern woman who, as a child, sat and listened to the stories the old Confederate veterans told about the old days before, during, and after The War. It is a love story, inspired in part by the novelist's grandmother, reflecting the attitudes left over from that long-ago time.Taken on its own terms, it remains the prototype of the Hollywood epic film. It achieved many firsts. Today, it remains--in terms of tickets sold--the all-time box office champ.---Hoyt Harris, Lafayette, LAGone with the Wind (70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition)Victor Fleming: An American Movie MasterFrankly, My Dear: "Gone with the Wind" Revisited (Icons of America)Gone with the wind, the screenplay by Sidney Howard; based on the novel by Margaret Mitchell***Vivien Leigh: A BiographyDavid O. Selznick's Hollywood*** *** *** *** *** *** ***Two years after announcing he would bring "Gone with the Wind" to the screen, producer David. O. Selznick--after paying the publisher MacMillan a record sum for the rights--still did not have a script. He was still a couple of months away from getting MGM to loan Clark Gable in return for world distribution rights and half the film's box office.Despite a phenomenally costly, two-year, nationwide search for an actress---amateur or professional--to play the tempestuous, spoiled and fickle Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara, Selznick still didn't have his Scarlett, either. (In all, 1,400 hopefuls were interviewed, 90 given screen tests, and exactly one actually cast, in a minor role. Also considered: Katharine Hepburn (who lobbied for the part), Bette Davis, and even RKO Studio's loony suggestion of Lucille Ball. Charlie Chaplin's companion, Paulette Goddard, seemed to have the role locked up, but a massive letter campaign spearheaded by the Florida chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy torpedoed it.)With or without a Scarlett, construction crews needed to get cracking on building sets for Selznick's epic--what many doomsayers were already calling "Selznick's folly." To make room for construction of a two-mile long re-creation of Old Atlanta, the back lot of Selznick International Pictures had to be cleared of old movie sets.Someone came up with the idea of burning the remnants of the set of KING KONG (1933) and filming it as the "burning of Atlanta," one of the great visual sequences in all of film.Just as Life itself so often does, it came down to one shot. There could be no retakes.Without a script, without stars for the two principal characters, on the night of December 10, 1938, the shooting of GONE WITH THE WIND finally began--stunt doubles for Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler escaping the inferno on buckboard as Los Angeles firemen aimed their hoses at the raining embers. (The fire on the Culver City back lot--fed by an elaborate system of pipes pumping oil and water through the sets so that the fire could be raised or lowered at will--was huge and intense. Its red glow was so ominous on low-hanging clouds on this chilly December night that hundreds of L.A. residents called the fire department, wanting to know if MGM was on fire.)Because there could be no retakes, the lenses of every available Technicolor camera (there were no more than a dozen in existence) were trained on the one-chance, make-or-break scene. As the sets went up in flames, Selznick's brother, the agent Myron Selznick, brought a lovely British actress onto the scaffolding, a perch from which "General" David Selznick was watching the inferno.David looked into the eyes of this exquisite, dark-haired, green-eyed beauty.A British actress little known in the United States at that time, Vivien Leigh-- who had made her first stage appearance at the age of three, reciting "Little Bo Peep"--was 26.But Vivien Leigh's entrance was no accident. She had come to Hollywood from England ostensibly to be with her lover Laurence Olivier, one of Myron's clients, whom she would marry a year and a half later when his divorce--and hers--became final.But Vivien Leigh had also come to Hollywood to pursue the part of Scarlett.Both Selznicks already knew of Leigh. But it wasn't until this night--with the crimson glow of the burning movie set illuminating her face--that David O. Selznick first laid eyes on Vivien Leigh.Leigh reportedly auditioned for then-director George Cukor that very night. A week and a half later, on December 21 and December 22, her screen tests were made. Legend has it that George Cukor called her three days later on Christmas Day to tell her she had the part. She signed her contract on January 16, 1939. Principal photography began on January 26.The opening scene of "Gone With The Wind," in which the Tarleton Twins are talking to Scarlett about the war, was one of the most troubled scenes of the film. It was shot a total of five times. The first time was on Thursday, January 26, 1939. Selznick was not satisfied with this take because the Twins's hair, dyed red for the film, appeared "too orange" in Technicolor. The scene was shot again on Monday, January 30, but was not used because of the lighting. When George Cukor left the production, Victor Fleming took over; his first scene, shot on Wednesday, March 1, was the porch scene. But Selznick was not happy with the Twins' performances so the take was not used. Fleming shot the scene again on Monday, June 26. This take was not used because Vivien Leigh looked "exhausted." She took a vacation before returning to shoot the scene a final time on Thursday, October 12, 1939. It was the last scene shot with Vivien Leigh and is the version that appears in the final film.So, in the finished film, Vivien Leigh is almost nine months older at the beginning of the movie than she is at the end of the movie.Now, let's fast-forward thirteen months.January 29, 1940-- Los Angeles--Ambassador Hotel's Coconut Grove.It's Oscar night in Hollywood. With comedian Bob Hope emceeing, the Oscar ceremony is underway. One after another, the gold-plated statuettes--gold-plated, 92 percent tin now, but gold-plated solid bronze on this night--are showered on GONE WITH THE WIND. It won't be a "clean sweep," but the movie will set a record for most Oscars won.--William Cameron Menzies for his use of color.--Hal Kern and James Newcom for film editing.--Ernest Haller and Ray Renahan for color cinema photography.--Lyle Wheeler for art direction.Acclaimed author Sinclair Lewis announces the Academy Award for best screen adaptation: a posthumous Oscar (the first such Oscar ever given) to writer Sidney Howard.(A lover of the quiet rural life, Howard had died five months earlier while working on his 700-acre farm in Tyringham, Massachusetts. The screenwriter was crushed to death in a garage by his two-and-a-half ton tractor. He had turned the ignition switch on and was cranking the engine to start it when it lurched forward, pinning him against the wall of the garage. Apparently an employee had left the transmission in high gear. Sidney Howard died less than four months before the movie he scripted had premiered. He never saw the movie that he had written--with the help of many others, including his micromanaging, obsessed producer.)Mervyn LeRoy, who produced THE WIZARD OF OZ this same year, steps to the podium to present the next Academy Award.--Best direction to Victor Fleming--who had simultaneously directed OZ--for GONE WITH THE WIND.All Oscar nights since the first one in 1928 had been glamorous ones. But this night was special. It represented what history would soon realize was the zenith, the high-water mark of the studio system and the Golden Age of Hollywood. In the twelve months of 1939, more now-classic films were produced than in any year-- before or since.In addition to GONE WITH THE WIND, 1939 saw production of the following movies:* Edmund Goulding's DARK VICTORY (with three nominations and no wins) about a young heiress who is slowly dying of a brain tumor and ultimately accepts her death in noble fashion* Director Sam Wood's GOODBY MR CHIPS (with seven nominations and one win - Best Actor), a version of James Hilton's novel about a beloved Latin teacher/schoolmaster at an English public school (the Brookfield School for Boys)* Director Leo McCarey's tearjerker LOVE AFFAIR (with five nominations and no wins) - that he later remade as AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER (1957) - about two lovers who promise to meet atop the Empire State Building* Director Ernst Lubitsch's delightful romantic comedy NINOTCHKA (with four nominations and no wins) about a cold Soviet official sent to Paris* Director Lewis Milestone's adaptation of the classic John Steinbeck tragedy "Of Mice and Men" (with five nominations and no wins)* Director John Ford's version of Ernest Haycox's story "Stage to Lordsburg", STAGECOACH (with seven nominations and two wins - Best Supporting Actor and Best Score) - the director's first film with star John Wayne - about a stagecoach journey by a varied group of characters* Director Victor Fleming's perennial favorite - the beloved fantasy film about a Kansas farm girl who journeys to a brightly colored world in THE WIZARD OF OZ (with six nominations and only two wins - Best Song "Over the Rainbow" (almost cut from the film by MGM executives) and Best Original Score)* Director William Wyler's best film version of Emily Bronte's romantic novel about doomed lovers in WUTHERING HEIGHTS (with eight nominations and only one win - Best Black and White Cinematography by Gregg Toland, who, the following year would shoot CITIZEN KANE for Orson Welles)* Director Frank Capra's film MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON (with eleven nominations and only one win - Best Original story) of Lewis Foster's story about a naive and innocent junior senator.But on this night the movie receiving Hollywood's glitter and gold was perhaps the most highly anticipated film in Hollywood history. The public had quickly made Margaret Mitchell's novel a best-seller after its publication in 1936. (It won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1937.) Sales of the novel, at the virtually unprecedented price of three dollars, reached about one million by the end of that year. Once it was announced that Selznick planned to adapt it the screen, the novel's legion of fans eagerly gobbled up any news about the production. The public also began clamoring for their favorite stars to play specific characters in the book.Five months earlier---while the film was being edited---when Selznick was asked by the press how he felt about the film, he said: "At noon I think it's divine, at midnight I think it's lousy. Sometimes I think it's the greatest picture ever made. But if it's only a great picture, I'll still be satisfied."On September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife Irene Mayer Selznick, investor Jock Whitney, and film editor Hal Kern drove out to Riverside, California, with all of the film reels to preview it before an audience. The film was still unfinished, missing many optical effects and most of Max Steiner's music score. They arrived at the Fox Theatre, which was playing a double feature of HAWAIIAN NIGHTS and BEAU GESTE. Kern called for the manager and explained that they had selected his theatre for the first public screening of GONE WITH THE WIND. The theater manager was told that after HAWAIIAN NIGHTS had finished, he could make an announcement of the preview, but was forbidden to say what the film was. People were permitted to leave, but the theatre would thereafter be sealed with no re-admissions and no phone calls out. The manager was reluctant, but finally agreed. His only request was to call his wife to come to the theatre immediately. Kern stood by him as he made the call to make sure he did not reveal to his wife the name of the film.When the film began, there was a buzz in the audience when Selznick's name appeared, for they had been reading about the making of the film for more than two years.In an interview years later, Kern described the exact moment the audience realized what was happening:"When Margaret Mitchell's name came on the screen, you never heard such a sound in your life."They just yelled, they stood up on the seats...I had the [manually-operated sound] box. And I had that music wide open and you couldn't hear a thing. Mrs. Selznick was crying like a baby and so was David and so was I. Oh, what a thrill! And when (the words) "Gone with the Wind" came on the screen, it was thunderous!"In his biography of Selznick, David Thomson wrote that the audience's response before the story had even started "was the greatest moment of his life, the greatest victory and redemption of all his failings."After the film, there was a huge ovation. In the preview cards filled out after the screening, two-thirds of the audience had rated it excellent, an unusually high rating. Most of the audience begged that the film not be cut shorter and many suggested that instead they eliminate the newsreels, shorts and B-movie feature, which is eventually how GONE WITH THE WIND was screened and would soon become the norm in movie theatres around the world.With thirteen nominations, the most ever up until that time, GONE WITH THE WIND won 10 Academy Awards--8 regular, 1 honorary, 1 technical--a record that stood for twenty years, until BEN HUR won eleven in 1960.***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****Quoting GWTW:Rhett: With enough courage, you can do without a reputation.Scarlett: Great balls of fire.

$REVIEW.: As usual, Streep is amazing in here character. Jones isn't one of my favorites but he is good and great to watch. I'm a 22 year old so I don't know precisely how accurate this film was, but I know it was funny and seems believable.It focuses on a side of an old married couple that I've never seen done before. Jones' character does seem a little cruel at times to the point that it seemed a little ingenuous (that a an old couple that loves each other this much could really treat each other like that) but not enough to ruin the movie. Other than the subject matter, it wasn't all that special of a movie.I did enjoy it, but the story and visuals were nothing special earning it a three, maybe a three and a half. Unfortunately, I can't give a half, and it seems like its on the shorter end of 3 and half, so its better fit with a 3 than a four. Still, it's worth watching at least once I think, especially if your a fan of Jones or Streep--or even Carell I suppose.
$SUMMARY.: It was funny and heart felt and had two great leads.

$review_text.: Las Vegas is my favorite place in the world. I love t.v. shows that are set in Las Vegas but when I first saw previews I thought it was going to like Melrose Place or something along those lines. But I completely wrong its a wonderful exciting show with amazing cast and it captures all the fun and excitement of Sin City. I love James Caan and Josh Duhamel and their charactors are wonderful as they trying to figure out each scam. The charactors of Mary, Nessa and Mike are also wonderful. I hope the show lasts for years to come.
$SUMMARY.: I love this show

$review_text.: Saw the movie twice at the theater. I wondered why Owen Wilson was cast in a Woody Allen movie. He was perfect for the role of Gil. I don't usually recommend any movie to friends and family, but I have recommended Midnight in Paris to anyone who would listen to me. ;-)Len

$review_text.: Fear in the Night, 1947 filmIt starts with a dream. There is a fight, a man falls, his body is pushed into a closet. How did those marks get on his throat? And the key? Vincent Grayson calls in sick, Kitty Winters takes his window at the bank. What is his problem? He asks advice from Cliff, his brother-in-law. How did the blood get on his hand? He puts an ad in the newspaper. Cliff takes them for a ride in the country. Vince is in a bad mood and tells Betty to forget him. There is a heavy rain. Vince knows the area. They stop at an empty house for shelter and warmth. Vince goes upstairs and finds an octagonal room with mirrors, just like in his dream! Cliff accuses Vince of lying to him.The Sheriff's Deputy shows up and tells about the murder that occurred weeks ago. The details are like Vincent's dream. The newspapers kept the story censored. Vince returns to his hotel room where he looks out the window in a dramatic scene. He tells Cliff about what happened the previous night. Is this a clue? Cliff figures out what must have happened. There is a test for Vince. There is a meeting where the murderer explains what he did and tries to justify his actions. Could hypnotism be used to create a murderer? Or cause a suicide? [Some say no.] The police are close behind. Belknap goes off the road. All of a sudden Vince is alright. There is a happy ending now.This film requires a belief in the idea that hypnotism can create a perfect crime. What about fingerprints? While the details of a murder could be obscured nothing can hide the motive for a murder. I don't know if anyone can be hypnotized or controlled to become an assassin, like "The Manchurian Candidate". We do know the media and advertising can create stories that millions believe because of their misplaced trust. Yet many who have witnessed an event will find errors in the newspaper report.This was based on the story "Nightmare" by William Irish (Cornell Woolrich).

$REVIEW.: Here's a huge dose of inspiration for the entire family, especially tweens & teens. I thoroughly enjoyed this & it's even more encouraging knowing it's a true story. This film should be shown in schools, homeless shelters, etc. ********************
