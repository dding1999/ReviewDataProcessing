$REVIEW.: Pencil is nifty.  I mean super nifty!  I love this little device.First, let me just say that I've tried other pencil/pen devices for iPad and all of them required a bit of mental gymnastics before they could be used.  Not Pencil.  VERY clear and EASY instructions are provided for the device, making it a snap to set up.Once the Paper app is installed and Pencil is connected, the device gives great results.  Paper offers a myriad of selections, including pens, pencils, a paintbrush & eraser.  Choosing colors is easy as well.  And the results when using Pencil are just great!  Additionally, those who have Pencil have access to other options without purchasing them!I really like the eraser feature.  It is so easy to just flip the Pencil over and use the eraser rather than having to select the different function every time.Digital artists will love Pencil, and so will those who want to use it to jot quick notes.  In summation, Pencil is easy to use, fits well in the hand, and produces good results.  What more could you ask for?Charging the Pencil is a snap.  Just plug it into the USB port of a computer and it charges.  No need for a separate adapter!

$review_text.: The Fujifilm FinePix F10 is a 6.3MP point-and-shoot digital camera made by Fuji Photo Film Co. of Japan (and in Japan).  Fujifilm is Fuji's brandname here in the U.S.  If I say "Fuji" in this review, you know I mean Fuji the company or Fujifilm the brand.While neither thin nor stylish, the F10 truly excels in picture quality.  Whether used indoors or outdoors, the F10 takes sharp pictures with very pleasant colors.  If you ever used Fuji's color film in the past, you know the company is famous for true-to-life color reproduction on film.  This F10 carries on this tradition and the pictures it takes are very pleasing to the eye.The most amazing part about the F10's excellent, superb picture quality is there's very little noise even at high ISOs, such as 400 or 800.  (I'll explain ISO in a bit.)  At 1600, the highest setting, you'll notice some noise when you view a picture at its full resolution.  However, when you print an ISO 1600 picture from the F10 at 5x7" or smaller, the print quality will still be excellent.(ISO refers to the sensitivity of the camera's sensor.  In the old days of film photography, it referred to the film "speed."  It was also known as the ASA rating before it became an international standard.  The higher the ISO setting, the less light you need for a proper exposure, but also the more noise, or digital specks, you get in the final picture.  This phenomenon is a law of physics.)The bottomline is, F10 takes amazingly beautiful pictures.  I rate its picture quality higher than my 6.1MP digital SLR, the Nikon D70.  I also rate it higher than all my previous compact digital cameras from Canon, Casio, Minolta, Nikon, and Sony.  I cannot describe how much I'm in awe with the F10's picture quality performance.In short: if you want a compact digital camera that takes truly excellent pictures, you should just get an F10.There are two reasons for the F10's top-of-the-class picture quality: 1) its CCD sensor (the camera's eye) is 1/1.7" in size, which is bigger than most compact digital cameras' sensors; 2) it uses new-generation Super CCD technology developed by Fuji -- there are actually a total of 6.63 million pixels on the CCD sensor, of which 6.3 million are displayed in the final image, which means the extra 330,000 pixels are used to provide additional information about exposure and color.  This extra information, even though not visible in the final picture, helps the camera's ADC (analog-to-digital circuit), which is the camera's brain, produce an awesome picture.Add to the big CCD sensor a superior 3x Fujinon lens (Fujinon is Fuji's brandname for its line of camera lenses) and Fuji's know-how in reproducting eye-pleasing colors, you get picture quality that will make everyone happy.The F10's excellent high-ISO performance also means you can take natural-looking portraits indoors without resorting to the harsh white light of the camera flash.  You know how it is: you take a picture of a group of friends indoors, and everyone in the front looks like Michael Jackson (the guy who bleached himself) and the rest in the back look like dark-gray wolves hiding in the forest.  The F10 has a "Natural Light" mode which suppresses the flash, jacks up the ISO, and takes a picture that looks soft and pleasant.  If you did this with most other digital cameras, you'll get lots of digital freckles on your friends' faces.  With the F10, the result is much more pleasing and the freckles much less noticeable, especially in final print (unless you print a poster the size of Niagara Falls).The F10 can also take movies.  You choose from two resolutions: VGA (640x480), which is the default, or QVGA (320x240).  The movies are taken at 30fps so they are pretty fluid.  The VGA resolution means you can actually use this as a camcorder -- just make sure to get a large xD memory card.  (See my review of the Fujifilm 1GB Type M xD card for some details.)Now, if you are a control freak type, the F10 may not be right for you.  This camera is designed as a point-and-shoot, or as they call it, a foolproof photo machine.  You don't get many manual controls.  You can't control shutter speed or aperture.  You can't focus manually.  Even the image quality and resolution settings are simple: whereas other brands let you set quality (i.e., JPEG compression level) and resolution separately, on the F10 you have a total of six choices that encompass both quality/compression and resolution.I *am* a control freak, but I don't mind the F10's lack of manual controls because, 1) I have my Nikon D70 digital SLR whenever I need ultimate "artistic" controls, and 2) I bought the F10 as a point-and-shoot for the times when I'm too lazy to want to make any manual adjustments.  You should ask yourself how important manually setting focus or adjusting aperture/shutter speed is for you when you consider the F10.What else is there to say?  Oh, the F10 is quite easy to hold.  It's not ultra-thin or ultra-compact, so it's actually easier for me to hold.  It has a large 2.5" LCD screen which acts both as the viewfinder (to compose the picture) and playback screen.  It's sharp and bright (and can "gain up" to superbright in low light situations) and displays fluid motions.  The F10 lacks an optical viewfinder (which some photo purists will insist on having) but does have an AF-assist lamp to improve autofocus in dim light situations.In terms of ease of use, the F10 is very easy to pick up and go.  You almost don't need to read the manual to get started.  On the other hand, almost all controls are accessed via a menu system, which is not the best kind of control scheme in the world.  The user's guide is your typical Japanese-translated-into-poor-English type you'd expect from a Japanese manufacturer.In summary, like the other reviewers have pointed out, this camera ranks very high in the picture quality department.  As long as you are comfortable *not* having manual controls other than ISO setting and exposure compensation, I bet you'll be very happy with the F10's picture quality.  Its exterior styling doesn't excite anyone, but as columnist David Pogue of the New York Times (and Macworld) points out: in photography, it's the inside that should count -- and he endorses the F10.BTW, the F10 is made in Japan, unlike other similar-priced digital cameras which are usually assembled in Indonesia, Thailand, China, or the Phillipines.
$review_summary.: Not thin or stylish, but *excellent* picture quality, even at high ISO

$REVIEW.: A nice camera for what I wanted it. I am working on learning manual settings and this camera is simple enough to allow me to do that without having to spend $1000 to do it. The zoom is fairly nice although occasionally the automatic focus makes it go funny and it takes a bit to make it work again. The autofocus is ok. Definitely better than you basic digital camera. I have enjoyed playing around with some sports and multi-shot settings.

$review_text.: I have been a fan of WD for many years.  Sure most companies go through periods when their products might not live up to expectations but WD has really stepped up their game.I purchased this drive to replace a Momentus XT in my Macbook 15" Unibody 2010.  I simply gave up with the bizarre behavior and constant firmware upgrades of the Momentus and went with this Scorpio Black released just days ago.Much to my suprise, its pretty much as fast as the Momentus XT (when it was working correctly) except for boot.  Since I am on a Mac, I really dont reboot much so its not an issue.The 750GB capacity is stunning!!  I have a 500GB Mac partition and a 250GB Windows Partition and I am pretty much set until SSDs drop in price.This drive carries a 5 year warranty and WD has always supposed their warranty program well.I am not noticing very much vibration in my Macbook but to be honest, I yanked the slow 5400rpm drive and replaced it with the Momentus as soon as I unboxed so I can not compare against the original drive.Battery life has decreased slightly (30 mins) but given the speed of the drive and the performance increase, that is to be expected.Remember if you are replacing in a Mac, do yourself a favor and invest in a quality set of percision screwdrivers as the screws are easily stripped and can often times be tight enough to strip inferior tools.

$review_text.: My daughter gave me a set of these for Christmas a couple of years ago.  I was using a cheap, low-quality brand on another device and thought there was a problem with the sound quality of the electronic device.  I switched the set of these Klipsch headphones over to the problem device and was amazed at the sound quality of what I thought had been a defective device.  It was the cheap earphone, not the device.  Rather that keep switching back and forth, I ordered another set of these IMAGE phones so I now have excellent quality on both devices.  I cannot recommend these highly enough.  The sound quality is great and the cords and connectors are excellent quality.  After daily use over many months, they are like new.  Other sets of earphones have had cords or connectors break over time, but not these.  If you are looking for great quality and don't care about showing off the latest brand name, get these.  You will not be disappointed.
$SUMMARY.: Great sound, The extra ear pads let you choose just the right size.

I was looking for a case that would protect the device and have a spot to store the charging cable.Pros:- This bag is just long enough to fit the Archos 101- The side pocket on the outside works for the charging cable as well as other small items.Cons:- Minor con is that the width of the case is a good bit larger than my tablet but it doesn't appear to be an issue other than extra size.Also, I didn't really think I needed the handles but have actually used them more than I expected.

$REVIEW.: Ali Etezadkhah's review is partially correct.  The leads on the dual in-line pin (DIP) switches are a bit short for convenient breadboard use.  On my breadboard, they make contact just fine, but don't go far enough down to stay put when flipping the switches.On the other hand, these switches are great for through-hole soldering on prototype boards like theSB400 Solderable PC BreadBoard.The blue push-and-lock switches don't come with any data sheet (the DIP switches are obvious, and there is a diagram included for the tact switches).  Each side of the push-and-lock switch has three pins, and the middle pin on each side connects to either of the end pins on the same side (a quick Web search for 'MDFly', 'Push-on', 'switch', and '1.5A' is your friend).And yes, they are about 5-7x the price of the same switches from electronics suppliers, but shipping from those guys can add up in a hurry, so if this is all you need, Amazon (Prime) may still be the way to go.

$review_text.: There are things you need to know about 3 TB hard drives that are not disclosed in the product information here.First, the drive I received was formatted with HFS+, Apple's file system, which was not disclosed anywhere in the product info
When connected to a quad core Windows 7 64-bit system, the hardware device was recognized, but Disk Management could not assign a volume letter, initialize or format the drive or do anything with it
The drive existed but was unusable.I guessed I should connect it to my Mac (good thing I have a Mac too), which instantly recognized the drive - and showed a readme txt file on the drive explaining it was set up as an Apple HFS+ drive
Lot of help that is for Windows 7 users! The printed instructions that came with the drive do not mention any of this.I used my Mac to partition and format the drive into a 3 TB NTFS drive


Took it back to the Windows PC, connected it up and viola, there it was showing about 2.746 GB of formatted space (or so).I began copying files onto the new drive and at just about 746 GB, I received a "Can't read source file" error message, even though all the original source files were completely readable and usable

This is a Windows bug - Windows is giving the wrong error message

The real problem, it turns out, is my BIOS does not support the larger drives (even though Windows is pretending its working with the 3 TB capacity) and seems to croak at the 2 + 746 GB mark


Checking HP's web site, I find HP never put out a BIOS upgrade, unlike some other vendors

Apple hardware has supported the large drives since at least 2006!Since I had already deleted files from my original source drives after copying (some huge 100 GB video project/editing files), I am now copying all the files back to the original drives
I will then re-partition the 3 TB drive using EaseUS Partition Pro (another $39) into 2 or 3 separate, but smaller drives

I believe I can then turn the partitions into dynamic drives and link them together into a single virtual drive using Windows.This is, needless to say, ridiculous.Before I'm done, I suppose I will end up having to buy a newer computer!Since none of this is disclosed in the pre-sales literature, I am giving the drive only 3 stars.UPDATE: Ultimately, this drive cannot work with my quad core Windows 7 machine
This turns out to be a well known >2 TB hard drive problem with Windows computers that may not be very old
Basically, the hardware was not designed to support greater than 2 TB drives

Some systems have a BIOS or driver upgrade that addresses the problem


Some, like mine, do not


You can go through the motion of setting it up and it will look like Windows 7 is supporting the drive, showing 2.746 TB of storage


However, what is actually happening is the size is wrapping around modulo 2 GB, thus Windows is only able to use the 746 GB of storage, not the full allocated space

Microsoft has a support article on this defect here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2581408The drive appears to work fine on my 2006-era Apple Mac Pro, an 8 year old computer! I may end up using on the old Mac Pro, however, this still leaves me in need of a solution for my Windows 7 computer

It seems the only solution is to buy several smaller drives


That is not a great solution as I have only one available eSATA port available
Oh well.Since this is a common problem, it would be helpful if the Amazon product description were updated for users to be cautious about purchasing drives larger than 2 TB in size, depending on whether their own computer can support larger drives.

$review_text.: My 10 megapixel Nikon photographs are overrunning my laptop so I needed mass storage. But I have never had great success in large back ups. On many other devices, I have regularly received read/write errors, inscrutible lists of what couldn't be copied, etc. I bought this last night, plugged it in and copied about 20Gb over to it perfectly. No problem at all, except when I turned around and accidently pushed it off the table. It fell to the floor and stopped working. Turned it off, turned it back on. Restarted the process and, again, it worked flawlessly. Can't complain at all. I'm using it as a USB 1.1 device, as it is backwards compatible, and that's all my laptop does. But I'm looking forward to using it as a USB 2.0 and/or firewire when the new laptop shows up. I have no problem with its rather quiet sound (quiter than the laptop itself.) It seems to be exactly what it says it is, and exactly what I wanted.******Update: It's still chugging away perfectly after 3 years!

After about 9 months of use, started to get blue screens.  Much testing lead me to believe it might be this drive or the motherboard.  Finally, after less than 11 months of use, the drive just died and failed to even run Samsung Magician to test it again.Tried to use website, where I had registered it and it showed up, to set up a return under warranty.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to do it on the website, even though there is a link, it doesn't let you actually do anything.  Tried to email tech support, which required that you select a reason from a pull down that was also non-functional.  Finally called and they emailed me for more info to send an RMA and mailing label.  I assume that they will honor the warranty, but first of all, the drive shouldn't fail in less than a year and it shouldn't be that difficult to get warranty service.(OK, it am a fool, but I bought the same drive as a replacement when this failed because it was my boot drive and I couldn't wait for the RMA process.  New drive is good after a week of use.  In all fairness, it could have just been that odd drive that failed.)

$REVIEW.: It works great and I'm very pleased with this purchase. It is quite a bit smaller physically than most flash sticks. With something this large of a capacity (32 Gb), it does far more than just transfer files. It winds up being a long term storage device as well. Consequently, be sure to make back-ups of data that you keep on it.

$review_text.: I have had these headphones for over 4 years


 So you may say, heck you must like them - not really


 As with most things, compared to nothing it's better


 So when I originally got these headphones and took a flight to Singapore it was great

 Engine noise was easily cut by a third
 They fold up to the size of your hand and the AAA battery last for 6 coast to coast flight (though always bring a backup)


However as I have become a more discerning listener and less willing settle, the 2/3 remaining noise has grown increasingly unbearable


 So these will go to auction and I am upgrading to the Sony MDR-NC20 which I have heard great things about.

$review_text.: I bought this XW-SMA3 about 2 weeks ago here at Amazon. So excited I ordered for overnight. Got it the next day and when I checked out the manual, could not believe this flow-chart. Watched UTube on the unit and this guy has it working in 2 minutes.Don't you believe it.I followed manual and re-watched Utubes for a week. I was on my network alright, however could not hear a thing. I gave up Saturday and set up time for my local Geek Squad to help the next Weds. Geek #1 arrived and I was helping mind you, never got any farther than I did. He left, I did not pay. Called them for Geek 2 to come out Thurs. Who shows up but Geek 1 with Geek 2. Geek 2 does what he does and decides router is not strong enough because everything else is on my router. Cable, internet, and phones.Check this out. He set up a new router to be used only for my local WiFi at home. Once this was hooked up he found the new network and on my PC connects this speaker to my Computer. Now I have a dedicated media line for all my stuff. Laptop, Tablet, and this speaker. Everything else TV, Receiver, BluRay, and Cable box is the same through Router #1. Thats all there is to it.Now I can play everything have in my Windows7 media player all over the house. The sound is amazing after 8 days with a headache for me and the 2 Geeks who figured things out.My advice, unless you are hooking up to a smartphone device,DO NOT TRY THIS ON YOUR OWN.Other than that have fun with another wonderful wireless Pioneer Speaker. By the way I have been connecting things to Tv's Receivers, and everything else until this XW-SMA3 portable My hope is that anybody trying to hook this up to a PC goes to someone who can think out of the box.

I'd ordered, around a few months ago, a set from another vendor (in another Shuttle SH67H3), and it was faulty, sent it back for another set and that set was good. 66% good, given my sample...so, test yours thoroughly...I used HCI Memtest, after several other RAM testing software didn't yeild results...-Update: Installed VMware ESXi on the box and was having issues that just seemed odd. Wiped the system and installed Win7, then ran HCI Memtest, and ding - failing at the top. Never known RAM to fail in a system that has seen very, very little use (under 50hrs as a HTPC) - at least, not in the past 15 years...so, I guess I'm contacting Corsair about this as a warranty issue.As a result, I'm running this on my older "twin" to see if it's also failing. May be time to switch brands. I've been reading that Corsair buys up chips that fail other brands testing, with the hopes that a few slipped through that are good, paying pennies on the dollar for the lot. Considering the number of fails I've had with Corsair recently (2 sets of SODIMMs (laptop 1), 1 sets of SODIMMS (laptop 2), 2 sets of SODIMMs (ITX-based PC), 2 sets of DDR3-DIMMS (PC 1), and now 1 set of DDR3-DIMMs (PC 2))...the track record isn't too thrilling.But, I can say that HCI Memtest is a good memory tester....

$review_text.: The G19s doesn't add much to the design or features of its predecessor, the G19.  Cosmetically, it has a new fingerprint resistant sparkly blue inlay and a matte wrist rest (which does show fingerprints!).There are 12 G-keys for macros, and 3 macro modes, for a total of 36 macros.  These can be elaborately pre-recorded and stored on the keyboard via the software, or quickly made on the fly with the MR button.  To the right of the MR key is one of my fave keys: the slider that allows me to disable the Windows key (between left CTRL and ALT). Great for gaming!The keyboard requires a power supply as well as a USB connection to my computer.  The good news is that this means the built-in USB hub is a powered hub, thus could charge my iPod or wireless headphones, as well a place to plug in my mouse or thumb drive. The USB hub is situated to the right of the LCD screen.The media controls on the top right side are nicely positioned and work great with iTunes and Windows Media Player. I especially like the wheel volume control, and the pause button right on the keyboard for if my phone rings.  iTunes and Windows Media Player support is built into the Logitech LCD software, but it's very basic, just showing the song title, artist, and play length.  It would be nice if it showed the album cover as well on the color LCD.In fact, in my opinion this is where the G19s falls a bit flat.  Considering the main draw of this keyboard is the 2.5" diagonal color LCD screen, it would be nice if there were actually some more apps to run on it.  Mostly my G19s just shows the clock. *shrug*  I don't play shooters--I am the MMO type--and the only game I play that supports the LCD is Guild Wars 2 (fyi, it just shows the zone completion stats, same as what you see when opening the map).  My guild uses Mumble, which includes an applet that will run on the G19s (as well as other the G-series keyboards with LCDs), but I wish there was a way to adjust the font size.  There's a Youtube player applet, but because it's a feed there is no way to select videos from my channel, just "Top Rated," "Most Popular," "Most Recent" and things like that.  For me, not being able to play my channel subscriptions, makes the applet pretty useless to me.  Pity.The G19s uses rubber dome key switches.  It is not mechanical, despite its high price tag.  Also, the Logitech Gaming Software is not included in the box and has to be downloaded from the Logitech website.  This gives macro support and the ability to configure which built-in LCD apps to display, plus configuration of the color and brightness of the backlit keys.  I like that the M1-M3 macros modes can be individually color coded, so you can tell which macro set you're using just by the backlight color.Overall, I like this keyboard very much, but I am a little disappointed there is not more to run on, or do with, it's main feature, the color LCD.

$REVIEW.: Professional quality?  No, no, of course not!  But you already knew that when you saw the cheap price, didn't you?  The question is, does it work passably well for occasional macro photography.  The answer is Yes, it does!  It's fine, actually.  There are just a couple of things you should be aware of:1) It has 2 knobs - one turns the gear which moves the rail back and forth, and the other locks it in place.  The gear is built to fairly loose tolerances, meaning it wiggles and the knob itself is not damped and does not offer any resistance.  So if the locking knob is not tightened and you tilt the camera too far (not uncommon in macro photography because you're often facing the camera downward), the camera and rail can easily slide right out of the bracket and crash on the ground.  I'd hate to see you accidentally destroy your camera or expensive macro lens, so please, for the love of Pete, TIGHTEN THE LOCKING KNOB!  It's really an awareness thing.  Once you realize that this little gizmo has the power to wreck your camera if you're not paying attention, you'll be more careful and you'll be fine.2) The item description says that this product is for Canon, Nikon, and Sony.  It's really for ANY camera, as long as that camera has a standard tripod mounting hole at the bottom, which means 99% of all cameras in existence.  Works fine with my Pentax cameras and any other brand.3) As mentioned earlier, the gear is not built to tight tolerances.  It wiggles a little bit back and forth and side to side.  This will be fine for most people... even if you're focus stacking, most focus stacking software will have no trouble aligning the images even if the rail wiggled a half millimeter or so between shots.  But if you're doing super high precision work where you have to make sure the focus plane is absolutely straight, or if you need to precisely measure the increments between shots, then look elsewhere.  Again, you get what you pay for.  For light duty use this thing is great.

$review_text.: Worked well the very first time. The projected colors are quite true to the original colors on my netbook screen. I had some trouble with finding out how to set 'eco' and 'standard mode' as well as the resolution. The very first time I projected my computer's Win 7 desktop, the projected display was fine; instead, the netbook screen display was fuzzier, the icons were bigger etc. Took me a bit to find out that I could correct this by just clicking on the c120's icon in the taskbar and then choosing the display resolution as 'mirror'. The quick-startup-guide could have been written a bit better - it tells you you can do this setting, but it isn't obvious where to find it. I'm no novice at computers and software, so I think I have a minor but valid complaint here (so, only 4 stars out of 5.) But otherwise, great little device. Even just a few years ago I was lugging around massive devices. Together with my netbook, smartphone and a thin external portable backup drive, it's amazing how totally mobile I am now.

$REVIEW.: If you spend the money on a high end device like a Zune, spend a little more on some premium headphones.  These have crisp highs and deep lows.  I can't imagine something this small sounding as good as they do.  Definitly a step up from the premium buds that came with my Zune.  They come with a handy protective pouch and three different sized canal pads to ensure you get a good fit.  There is also a cord shortener that I haven't used much.  I am impressed by the great sound and the quality of the entire package.  Better than the Bose buds and much cheaper than the Shure stuff.  I caution anyone who buys/uses these to store them in the protective pouch.  The canal pads pop off pretty easily and the bud are unusable without it.  I have also read of them being fragile near the connector.  I've had mine for a year and I use the pouch they still work for me.

I can fit eightSANYO eneloop AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteriesin the two pockets on the left side and twoCanon LP-E5 Battery Packswith their protective covers in the two pockets on the right side.  Everything is held in securely.  In addition, the fold-over red flags are a really great idea to indicate which batteries have been used.I keep this wallet in one of the outside pockets of myCanon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EGfor easy access.  It fits perfectly.  TheTamrac S.A.S. MXS5363 Compact Filter Casefits perfectly in the other outside pocket.  For a long shoot where you might have to change your batteries, you could also use the velco and snap strap on the back to put it on your belt.I haven't yet found a use for the full-length sleeve that's behind the two right pockets but I guess that you could put a couple of SD memory cards in there.  This wallet is probably also good for storing the larger Compact Flash memory cards, but the XSi uses SD memory cards and it's pretty big to use just for storing these.  I use theVelbon DMSP-SD4 Plastic Case for SD Memory Cardswhich can store four SD cards in less than half the space of this wallet.It's well made with a sturdy zipper and durable nylon fabric so I think that this wallet will last a long time.

$review_text.: From Crucial's firmware update web page: "From BIOS Setup, change the SATA mode to IDE or Legacy mode or "compatibility mode." The firmware update will not work in AHCI mode."I ordered the Crucial SSD from Amazon to upgrade a laptop acquired locally in a rush. I checked before ordering and did receive from Amazon what was then the current firmware version 002. Crucial posted a newer firmware 006 as my new SSD was in-transit. My generous rating reflects the ease of installation of Windows 7 x64 Ultimate to the Crucial SSD. Five stars to Amazon order processing,shipment and post-sale support.YES: Microsoft you really need a supported utility to move the \Users folder and or \Programs folders to a separate drive! Playing with REGEDIT, inoperable XLM scripts from the Microsoft's user community and "ProfileMove" freeware that did part of the job, and I finally achieved my plan. The "Windows Experience Rating" jumped from 5.9 to 6.5.Then I found that Crucial had a new firmware update. It is a multi-step process: obtain the ISO image, create CD, make a full backup, and disable AHCI in BIOS. OOPS! My BIOS does not support the older technology and the firmware update failed as stated above. It gets worse..."Madeline" from Crucial chat support was apologetic but disabled the connection as soon as I inquired about a just-received Crucial SSD with version 002 for 006 exchange. Crucial:"that dog don't hunt"! After years of doing commercial business with Micron / Crucial: farewell. You should study Amazon's customer support policies and processes.Yes, buy a SSD from Amazon but first check how its manufacturer wants you to implement firmware updates, a crucial (no pun) process with this evolving technology. I am capable of making Crucial's process work but WHY? They chose to make it so outdated and complex, not me. Not needing "USB 3" support for a SSD, I found a competitor's SSD that updates firmware from within the operating system under AHCI. Its tech specs and reviews are as good too. Amazon gets another order from this Amazon Prime customer as soon as my refund posts. Amazon's refund-confirming email arrived Friday 12-3-2010 after mailing it back Monday of this week.

$review_text.: Yes, this is a essentially a thin piece of silicon that just goes around the edge of the nano as one reviewer put it, but there really isn't much else you can create to protect a tiny nano with a big clip on the back! This is exactly what I expected and of course it's pretty inexpensive.My only quips:- Yes the material is a bit stretchy, but that IS the only way to pull the cover on and off.- It doesn't cover any of the bottom of the nano - yes that is where the connector and the earbud plugs are, but there is some space on the left it could cover.- Because this cover wraps around the back where the clip is, it doesn't allow you to open up the clip all the way. You have to kind of pull the cover aside and only then can you press down on the clip and open up enough of a space to, say, get it on the waist of your workout shorts.

$review_text.: Nice mount at a nice price. I've used this mount for both a 24 and 36&#34; LED TV. Apart from the mounting plate which attaches to the back of the TV, the unit is relatively low profile and easy to mount. Here are a couple of things to note: 1) Depending upon your TV, the mounting plate may hang over your connectors. You may have to either move the mounting plate way up on your TV (such that the top of the plate is almost perpendicular to the top of the TV, or use spacers to push the plate away from the back of the TV. I had this issue with my 24&#34; LG LED. 2) To mount to the wall, you must pop of the plastic bolt caps that cover the bolts on the swivel points. If you don't do this you will never be able to get a socket wrench on the mounting bolts 3) Loosen the swivel bolts! The bolts come tightened so that the unit will not move easily out or around. Loosening the swivel bolts will prevent you from damaging your TV if you try to move it around by the TV and not the bracket. 4) This kit comes with numerous bolts, washers and spacers for many TV applications; HDMI cable, magnetic level (don't use it), and an offset wrench (don't use it) presumably for adjusting the swivel bolts and mounting lag bolts as well as adjusting the TV lock-down bolt.

$review_text.: Bought one of these for my parents

 It is one of the simplest devices to set up and to operate that I have ever encountered
 This model has an HD connection, and that really takes the thinking out of it as far as what goes where, but also sports component video and trusty old RCA red white yellow


 This player has pretty much as much connectivity as you could possibly hope for

 My parents are not huge tech people, and I was sold on the simplicity of the remote
 I was also sold on the wireless option


 The internal wireless receiver works well, although my parents were a little limited by the age of their router


 Rather than replace this, you could always get a long ethernet cable (100 feet runs about $10), drill a couple of strategic holes, and forget about it
 We found that on wireless G (108) and given the distance, it takes about 3 minutes to load a 30 minute recording


 It takes about 15 seconds when wired


 If you have this connected to a receiver, you'll also enjoy the benefit of high quality wireless music; Roku can "talk" to Pandora and several other services.Long story short: it took longer to unpack it than it did to set it up


 It's easy to use, and I suspect they had the non-tech-savvy in mind when designing the remote
 I highly recommend this.

$review_text.: The unit arrived well packed in an attractive box. All of the bits inside were very easy to get at when I unpacked them. I took the DVD player out of the box, plugged it in using the connection provided, inserted a DVD, did what seemed obvious with hardly any need to study the instructions, (like pusing the "play" button) and it worked  fine straight away. Total elapsed time from opening box to playing was less than three or four minutes. I have no complaints except that it would be nice to include a headset, even if it was only a cheap one, since operating the unit in public using only the internal speakers could be annoying to others. For the rest, I recommend this player highly based on quality, funtionality and comparable price.

$review_text.: I have been using mine for about 3 weeks. I seems just as described in ads, was shipped quickly and worked just fine right out of the box. It is certainly much better than the bare bones, noisy units that are sold for next to nothing. I had one of the cheap FM transmitters previously and the audio quality and poor FM signal generator made it almost unusable. I'll keep this SoundFly AUX and now I have a way to listen to the hundreds of public domain books available for free on the web while I am commuting.PROS - The signal (programmable to any even or odd FM frequency, e.g., 92.3, 92.4, 92.5, 92.6, etc.) is solid, loud and clear. However, it is FM radio quality audio. Don't expect it to sound as good as a CD or DVD audio though, as no FM radio audio quality can ever match CD or DVD audio. No surprise there, huh? I like that it reads both USB jump drive and SD cards. It displays both folders and files on the menu but seeing a complete Windows type file screen is too much to expect of any small screen unit such as this or an MP player - only so much info will fit in the six or seven lines of text on the display. The blue, lighted display is clear from angles but like so many displays, is hard to make out when I wear my polarized sun glasses.CONS - Remote is nice but you have to hold it right in front of the main unit. I am going to change the 2025 battery included with the remote unit in hopes that a fresh battery will allow a greater range on the remote. The FOLDER/MENU display is a little tough to navigate but not a deal breaker. Early on, I also remember messing with the four memory frequencies to get it to keep my preferred FM radio broadcast frequencies. I did manage to get some preferred frequencies set up but it was in no way intuitive. Also, the unit tilts up/down but not left to right. Still, no deal breakers there! Finally, I cannot say that this unit is completely intuitive so you may expect to refer to the manual now and again. The manual is helpful but neither the best I have ever read nor the worst. It does suffer from a little bit of the dreaded trans-chinese/english, "If you know what of meaning I say..."Unlike most CD players in cars, you must use the bookmark button to have the unit remember where you were in a song or audio book when you shut of the car. So, if I understand the instructions correctly the procedure is to set the bookmark, shut off the Soundfly unit and then you can shut down your car - big pain.BREAKING THE RULES - So I just set my bookmark, shut off the car, and that's it. That procedure has worked OK for me so far! I am also leaving it in the car (parked outside) and it is surviving 20 degree nights just fine too. We'll see what happens when it gets down to zero overnight - stay tuned!THE LAST WORD - Call me Mr. Obvious but it should be stated that the quality of the audio you hear is important to people and truly objective reviews of audio quality are rare. I can tell you with certainty that what you hear is dependent on three things - the quality of this little unit, your particular FM radio and the quality of the MP files you play through it. If your MP files are noisy, recorded badly or otherwise sub par - no player in the world will make them sound better.Here's two fictitious reviews to make my point.1.) "The high quality, professionally produced MPeg music file I bought from a web music service played great and sounded wonderful through this unit broadcasting to my car's Bose FM radio." (Useful review)2.) "This MP player/transmitter sounds cruddy and smells funny - don't buy it!" (Useless review)I want to thank others who take the time to review products. I rely heavily on the COLLECTIVE wisdom of the reviews when making my purchases. I hope my reviews are always useful and truthful to you.

I recharged my Sansa Zip, my iPod Touch, my Nexus 7 and my cell phone. It did the job quickly and efficiently and still showed 50% when I was finished.

$review_text.: I recently purchased the new Canon Powershot N compact digital camera. While on the phone with the camera store where I made the purchase the salesman suggested I pick up extra batteries for the camera since the ones supplied by Canon did not last very long before needing to be recharged. He offered a charger and batteries package for $50 that most surely would increase my photo taking pleasure. I politely declined his offer and instead looked to Amazon for an alternative. That's when I found Wasabi batteries and charger kit. The batteries are rated at 1200 mAh compared to the OEM battery's 850 mAh. Longer battery life at half the price of the camera store kit. Winning.

 It is a perfect fit regarding size and the camera


 Installation, however, was more painful than installing a screen protector on an iPhone


 I've done a couple iPhones, and they worked pretty well.The bigger protector here was definitely a challenge to install without bubbles
 Once installed however, it has been great

 It does collect finger oils, but they wipe off very easily.With a 5 and 7 year old, I definitely recommend a screen protector!

$REVIEW.: My first impression of this speaker was that it was amazing and well-thought-out - and that was before I heard it.When you undo the speaker and let it reach its full height you are creating an enclosure that boosts the bass. That means that you get a sound much better than you would have expected from something that reminds me of a hockey puck.If you listen to the sound samples people have used on their review videos remember that what you hear is affected not only by the speaker but also the speakers of your own computer.This product shows all the signs of careful design. I think it will last you a while.

$review_text.: This item is being returned. The whole affair with this company and this keyboard has left me with a distaste.First of all the statement that this item is for the Apple TV is just flat-out untrue. Yes, it has a sleeve for an apple remote, but beyond that, this keyboard has nothing at all specific to the Apple TV. It even has a "windows" button. Second of all, the item I got is defective. The most important key... the "down" arrow does not function on mine. Although this might not seem like a big deal, you would be surprised how often that key is required. More often than any other key. Thirdly, the item did not include the promised Bluetooth Dongle. Any one of these issues by themselves could be chalked up to a mistake or manufacturing issue. Combined? Well you be the judge.I am sending this thing back and getting something by another company. After this issue I will be sure to communicate to my peers my full thoughts on this product and the company that manufactures it.Also, maybe you will have better luck, but to me a three-axis gyroscopic "air-mouse" is really next to useless. Maybe it takes some getting used to, I am not sure, but for me the mouse just seems to float wherever it likes no matter how I hold it. When giving up and reaching for my standard laptop trackpad the air-mouse still stays active while undoing anything I try and do by virtue of being moved even a slightest bit. Also, for some unknown reason, the right and left mouse buttons are inverted meaning that the left mouse button is on the right and vice versa. My first impression was that maybe I was holding it incorrectly, but no matter which way you hold it, the keys are inverted. It is counter-intuitive to have the buttons this way as you cannot just "left-click". One must think about it every time before actually clicking.

The fabric is very stretchy but thick enough so it protects the netbook. The smaller outer zipper compartment stretches enough to hold my netbook cords, cordless mouse, and iPod, although of course it does "stick out".  It is small enough to put into a carry-on, or I can just carry it with its handles.  For the price, I think it's a good deal.

$REVIEW.: I opened it up and plugged it in.  It comes with a USB cable!  I saw the videos - very cool!  I learned that the software enables you to post and get stuff from Flickr, Facebook, etc.  It works with Time Machine on Mac.  You can get a driver to use interchangeably on a Windows machine.  I have Windows Vista on a laptop and it is compatible.  The files do not have to be converted.I have an external hard drive currently hooked up to time machine, but I have lost external backup drives before.  I used this one as a drag and drop drive.  (The software had an error (probably due to my other external drive).  So, as I wanted to do in the first place, I just opened the hard drive and dragged stuff to folders I made on the drive.What is important to not, as I backed u stuff or made folders, they would duplicate and copy to my source folder. Now I have too many copies of my mailboxes for Mac Mail.  No problem.  I figured a way around that.  When I backed up my user folder, applications, desktop, and all, I merely copied the folder, CLOSED FINDER FOLDER, and pasted the goodies onto a selected folder in the opened Seagate Slim folder.  It took about 1.5 hours and everything is backed up.If you are going to do it that way, when the time comes for another backup, I will trash the folders and start the process again.  The next time I will do a better job organizing my desktop:=)  To get files from the folder, open an empty folder (not on desktop) and drag goodies from place to place.  Then you can place them wherever you want them.Just note that you don't have to worry if you install the Seagate software and follow the directions to do what it has the potential to do, which is to put backup goodies back in the same place where they were. I jus chose to do it manually.  Voila!  It works!By the way, I kept the box for safe transit.

$REVIEW.: We dumped satellite television just under a year ago and began using antennas.  We had a different type of antenna for each television (3 total), but this was my first experience with the Mohu Leaf. I have been quite pleased with the Mohu Leaf. What I like about the Leaf is that while it didn't necessarily provide more channels for us (many channels were duplicated) the quality of the channels were quite good. We didn't have the "jumping" that can occasionally happen with a couple of our other antennas.  You do need to play around just a bit to determine the best place in the room for the antenna. So, if you don't get good service when you first plug it in, move it around the room and that may help quite a bit.All in all I can definitely recommend this product if you are looking to get a good variety of local channels and would like HD quality. The antenna does provide just that. It provides a very good quality television viewing experience.

Not bad considering the backlight was in full use the entire time.  Would probably last even longer with just occasional use and quality rechargeable batteries.There really isn't anything about this keyboard that I don't like, but if I had an opportunity to make a small improvement, it would be to space out the keys just a tad bit more.  That would make it less prone to double key strikes.

$review_text.: This LION battery pack is being offered by the seller as &#34;guaranteed to work with the Canon 6D&#34;. I am happy to verify this claim: these STK batteries do in fact report shutter count and charge state on my Canon 6D, whereas my four Bowen and Wasabi aftermarket batteries, that were purchased over the last 2 years for my Canon 60D do NOT communicate with the 6D.  So evidently Canon has tightened up the requirements for the 6D in terms of what data format it wants a battery chip to communicate. Anyway, these STK's have whatever &#34;the right stuff&#34; is that the 6D wants.  After giving both of the batteries a full charge I put them into my NEEWER battery grip and the 6D reported both batteries as 100% charged and Zero for the shutter count. I charged one of them with the official Canon charger that came with the camera, and the other with an aftermarket charger. Both batteries were done charging in approximately the same amount of time and neither got noticeably warmer than the other during charging.As for the claim of 2600mah capacity, I will see how they do over the next couple of months, and see if they do in fact last longer than the OEM Canon battery.  At $13 each, you could buy FOUR of these batteries for the same price as one Canon OEM battery, so even if the 2600 mah capacity is overly optimistic, I don't see how you could go wrong, assuming these batteries give as least 75% of the number of charge cycles as an OEM battery.  The two year old Bowen and Wasabi batteries I bought for my 60D are all still working, none have failed, and they all hold a full charge for at least a couple of weeks before they self-discharge below 90%.RECOMMENDED (will change to HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if no failures before June 2014)

$REVIEW.: I bought these on a woot-off figuring there was a 50:50 chance they would not work at all on my Mac.  My concerns were justified by the instructions that were included, because the instructions never mentioned a Mac at all.  So I used them first on my PC, and found the 8 step setup to be tiresome but it worked.  Then I noticed on the box that Mac OSX was listed so I went to the web site and downloaded the instructions.  The Mac setup was much easier than the PC setup (see below).  I popped in a movie with 5.1 surround sound and was astonished to discover that the sound was oustanding, provided a full sound stage, and did so with clarity in the mid and high ranges and decent, if a bit muddy, bass.  I was also able to control the volume without problems using the standard Mac DVD player volume control.  For the price, these headphones are superb for watching movies with your computer.  The surround sound works perfectly and makes the movie much more fun to watch.For Mac users then, here are the instructions for setting the headphones up:1.  Plug the headphones into one of the usb connectors2.  Open up preferences3.  Select Sound4.  Select Output5.  Select USB audio device (which shows up provided the headphones were plugged in)If the USB audio device does not show up, you may need to restart the computer with these plugged in.  But that should not be necessary.Once registered in the sound preferences, they work.  Until this is done, however, no sound at all.  If you plug these back into the same usb connector that was used to register them during preferences, they will automatically switch to using the headphones.  If you select a different usb connector, you will need to reregister them in preferences.  From this point on, these are plug-and-play and you never need to use preferences again.  Amazing, at least to me.For the price, these are hard to beat.  But know that when listening to standard stereo, these are not great headphones and are not recommended.  The bass is muddy and they are bulky and  heavy.  But these issues seem to become unimportant when watching a movie in 5.1 surround.  These earphones come alive.

The only issue I have ever had is when we put a &#34;copied&#34; disc in the drive that had a label on it.  The printed labels you put on yourself are too fat to go in this drive well.  I ended up tossing all the disc's with those labels so there would not be issues with getting the disc out.  One of the disc's almost didn't come out at all which was not a good thing.

$REVIEW.: This Denon AVR 3311CI Receiver replaced a Yamaha RX-V863 7.2 Receiver. As Good as the Yamaha sounded this unit is Light years ahead in features and Sound quailty. The Yamaha RX-V863 was POWERFUL  & crisp, I could feel the bass reverberate in my chest and throughout the house at times when the Subwoofer kicked in, so much so that my wife complained continually to turn it down  while she was in our bedroom. I think women generally do not like  much bass. let me add that I have complete Infinity Beta Speaker 5.1 Speaker system. The overalll sound of this DENON AVR 3311CI is extremely balanced, nothing that over-powersBefore getting this receiver and used the Yamaha RX-V863 7.2 Receiver , I  watched Movies 35% the time , Watched TV 45% time  and Listened to Music 20% of the time.and had to use my wireless headphones at night. Now things have totally changed. Listen to Music 65% and TV and Movies about 35%. and that because this Denon Avr 3311CI sounds fantastically crisp clear and totally fills  my 30'X 19'X 14' (high ceiling) that is open to the kitchen & Living room too. I have the Denon connected to  a router , which is connected to two computers and a different room providing LAN connectivity for access to online media  such as  Rhapsody & Pandora have become my favorite way of listening to music. I waited 5 mounths after purchase to give this unit a fair review.PROS:* EASY INSTALLATION .....5 STARS* SOUND QUAITY....5 STARS* VIDEO UP-CONVERTING....5 STARS* Audyssey MultEQ XT....5 STARS* HD radio and iPod/iPhone Direct Connectivity...5 STARS* REMOTE......4 STARS* Rhapsody & Pandora sound... 5 STARS* WINDOWS 7 CONNECTIVITY FOR MUSIC ACCESSCON:* MIGHT FREEZE UP ,REQUIRES RESTART OF ONLINE  Rhapsody & Pandora  AT TIMES DUE TO NETWORK PROBLEMS...AND MAY NOT BE THE RECEIVER'S FAULTI HIGHLY recommend getting this unit or any Denon or Maranz Receiver with Audyssey MultEQ XT.....purchased from Electronics-Expo for $ $769 + $29 shipping complete. NOTE THIS UNIT IS IDENTICAL  features TO THE Marantz SR7005 except in  outward appearance and the Denon is $400 cheaper. both own by the same parent companyUPDATE: 10-12-2011 THIS RECEIVER STILL PLAYS FANTASTIC MUSIC VIA MY 7.2 SETUP. MOVIES AND TV IS ALSO 5/5 HOWEVER PANDORA AND RHAPSODY SOMETIMES FREEZES STILL....Been look to upgrade master bedroom  with a new Denon Receiver like the new Denon AVR- 1912, which has Internet service for music and Air Play. But the price is remains $500-$600 for a unit that is let powerful than my year old Denon Avr-3311ci...The Denon AVR-3312 is still $900-$1000....My solution is to move the 3311ci into the bedroom and replace it with the Highly-Rated Onkyo TX-NR809, that is more refined and more powerful at 135 watts...it arrives  10-13-2011

$REVIEW.: The Cosmos strap replaces the original Canon strap that came with my SX40, a camera that only weighs 21 ounces
The trouble with 21 ounces is that after 5 miles of hiking, it becomes 10 pounds, and the weight is concentrated.This is the fifth strap that I've bought through Amazon, and it is the overall best that I've tried
It's not perfect, but it is an improvement.I saw that the Cosmos was wider than the Canon original, and I thought it would disperse the weight better, and it does! It is definitely more comfortable than the Canon strap, BUT I wish it was padded and that the edges were curled (called "beading" by those who sew)


I've yet to find a strap like that that would last [see other review] and stand up to sweat.Although I had some difficulty in putting it on the camera - I ALWAYS have difficulty - and that it is somewhat narrower than I'd like, I still give it 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: Very nice, inexpensive camera.  Takes regular AA batteries, so it is easy to always be ready to take some pics.  I paired it with a cheap, hi-capacity memory card, and I can take photos for days.The included settings are very nice and this camera takes very good photos right out of the box, no monkeying around.  If you are a camera novice like me, and do not want to spend $200 or more on a camera, this camera is going to do everything you need it to do.I am not a pro, nor an amateur, nor even much of a hobbyist.  I do not read the manual that comes with cameras.  I needed a small, light, not too expensive camera to be able to take nice, high res photos with good, accurate color and detail and that is exactly what I got, at a price that is shockingly good.This is a very light, small camera, but it is maybe an inch to an inch and a half thick, so this is not the camera you want if you are looking for a tiny subcompact camera that fits in a shirt or jeans pocket with no bulge. But, it is small, but takes great pics, and there are a bunch of built-in scene modes, like Portrait, or Landscape--stuff like that so you can set the camera for what you are doing and take a nice picture.  It has a 3.3x zoom, which is handy.  You aren't going to be able to see the lion's eyeball if you take the camera on safari, but it allows you to zoom in on your friend's face, or a houseplant, or your dog, whatever, without dancing back and forth, to and fro to get a good framed shot.It is ready to take pictures in less than a second from the time you hit the power button, and it has surprisingly good battery life (I have a 5 MP Canon Powershot from 5 years ago higher up the line with doodads and features I only rarely used, but the battery life on that thing stinks).  The battery life on this camera is pretty darned good.Great starter camera for a kid or young adult, great camera for someone like me--who like to take some pics but will probably never worry about aperture or exposure or white level.  All around, general purpose camera that rocks sums it up well.

$review_text.: I was convinced by several of my outdoorsey friends that I needed a weatherproof camera so I bought this on the basis of reviews for a backpacking trip to the canyons of Utah

 I also brought along my old smaller lighter much cheaper Canon 850IS


 I left the Pana hanging around my neck and snapped away- 600 pics in 4 days

 I was pleased with its  very fast response and it kept on ticking even in dirty and wet conditions


When I got home I found the screen had been scratched by the  sand and dust
(So it is only sort of weatherproof)  When I downloaded the pictures,  there were some really good ones but none were the GREAT ones I had planned on

 Most had poor color saturation, strange color balance and were not sharp
 Almost 35% were completely ruined by camera shake (yes I had the IS on)


 I had taken a few pictures with the Canon and they were magnificent

 So I sat down at home and did a head to head comparison
 The Canon blew away the Panasonic - no contest whatever
In less than full light the Panasonic consistently takes noisy, undersaturated, fuzzy images


In bright light it still lags in sharpness and saturation

 I think would rather keep my camera in a bag and pull it out for a great picture now and then rather than fill up endless disks with 14MB  crummy ones


 This baby is going back.

$REVIEW.: A handy powered speaker that greatly improves the audio quality of your small devices. It provides a nice sound from a small lightweight package and it is easy to fit into any bag.While the batter does last through the day, it doesn't last overnight. The speakers do not work at all when powered off but they do still work when plugged into a standard USB charger; which is not included.I was not impressed by the clip system at all. While the springs are strong, the clip is too short and curved which leads to a poor grip at a weird angle and a bouncy connection. I think a sliding clamp would work better than a rotating clamp, ideally one that could support the tablet standing up. This device only works as a stand in that it props up the side of the tablet it is attached to.While the speaker would be a welcome addition for travel with a number of devices, the clip is also not well suited for a handheld device such as an iphone or ipod, while the devices fit well inside the clamp zone, there is not a stable surface on the speaker for the backside when clamped.I would also like to be able to use this with my laptop, but the cable is too short to reach from the speakers to the computer's headphone jack.The attachment system seems well thought out from a design standpoint with the speaker itself as it sleekly wraps around when closed. However not enough time was spent in designing it to work with devices; I did not find any application that it worked well with.

Analog reception is as good as any analog tuner I have (5). Digital reception is sub-par, less than any of the (4) DTV tuners I have.My best digital receiver gets 10 channels (I live in the sticks) the best I can get is 3 with this tuner.Am I going to send it back, NO. Would I get another NO.Seems to have a problem with the software recording past midnight. keeps recording but screen freezes.If just for casual use, and you don't rely on it to record than you can get by.I have no problem with the remote, I taught my RF-20 all the commands and it works great. The original remote will not let you change from analog to digital (which sucks)(or from one source to another) so you will still need to mouse around to get what you want.OK for casual use.

$review_text.: I am a Time Warner (TW) cable customer in SE Wisconsin.  The purchase via amazon.com was as always, flawless.  I had heard that TW was going to start charging their customers $3.95 per month to rent their cable modem and indeed seen it on my recent bill.After some recommendations and review searching, I settled on the Zoom 5341J cable modem and have been running it for a week with no issues.  I have run a number of speed tests from various sites and consistently get the same results, which match my TW Internet package speeds.  This particular model is also compatible with the higher-speed packages offered by TW, so if I need more speed, I will not have to swap-out my new cable modem.I spent more time on hold (around 20 minutes) waiting for a TW technician than I did getting the new cable modem to work.  Once the TW technician verified my account and new cable modem MAC, it took just a couple of minutes to finish the initialization.  After-which I could surf the web immediately.My process was...- Disconnect the old cable modem.- Connect the new cable modem, power on and wait for it to be fully initialized.- Connect my PC directly to the new cable modem and wait for an IP address to be assigned.- Browse to any Internet site to receive the self-service TW page (which basically tells you to call them).- Call TW and have the technician assign the new cable modem to my account and ... done.As with any electronic device, only time will tell how durable the Zoom 5341J is.  My expectation is that it should last many years and just plain work (all of the time).

$review_text.: The Arctic Power Bank 4000 hold 4000 mAh of power for portable charging of rechargeable devices (or portable power for devices that are USB powered but don't need a computer to be used...more on that later). 4000 mAh is two and a little bit of a charge for the iPhone 5S (1560 mAh if the Internet is to be believed). This means if you want something to keep your phone charged while waiting for a plane - and you don't want to give up Wi-Fi, YouTube, SnapChat or your Spotify music, this is great. If you are trying to keep an iPad charged, they are roughly 12000 mAh, so you would get 1/3 of a recharge out of this. There are 12000 mAh power banks out there, if you really want to carry that.So how does the Arctic work? It works just as you would expect honestly. Charge it with a micro-USB cable (use your car or phone charger, or your laptop). When it's charged, plug the USB end of your charge cable into the battery, plug the other end into the device and boom, off you go. The output is 2.0 A so recharge times are pretty quick for your devices.The Arctic is a nice brushed aluminum finish on the top with a rubberized bottom. It is quite light and easy to carry - could easily fit in the same pocket you put your phone.My only con is that, for the price (or close to it), there are other options that have a display to show you how much of a charge is left in the battery. There isn't any indicator on the Arctic. There is an LED light that lights up when you first plug something in to charge, but it goes out after 10 seconds. The light also goes until it is recharged.If you are looking for a 4000 mAh backup battery/power bank, the Arctic is a really nice, light weight and easy to use device. If you don't mind not having any easy way to tell how much of a charge is left in the battery itself, it's a good device and worth it.Pros:4000 mAh that's easy to carry and looks goodEasy to use and understandCons:No way to tell how much juice is left in the batteryI received a free sample for review purposes from the manufacturer.

$REVIEW.: Why bother if it can't do anything all that well.  Graphics don't seem noticeably improved, It hears and sees about as well as my dead grandmother.  Think of Siri, Xbox360, and Logitech's Google TV mashed together but none of it works any better then those three separate systems do.  If you don't own a 360 then maybe it's worth it after games are released and hopefully some improvements are made.  This is nothing more then a incremental upgrade NOT a new ground breaking system, and it isn't even backwards compatible.  This is a crash and burn for Microsoft along the lines of Windows ME, except this will really take up space at the landfill.Update:  My initial Kinect died in less then a week so I had an advance replacement shipped. The replacement Kinect sent died in less then 48 hours. I tried to get it replaced they said they had to receive the first Kinect before they could ship a new one.  Additionally the DirectTV programing guide isn't showing all the channels for my area and tries to tune to channels I don't have such as ABC HD.Since the quality control issues are severe and their policy towards the customer is so poor I am returning the XBOX One and have already ordered a PS4.  Three red ringed (broke) XBOX 360s and now a repeat with the XBOX One.  I have bought Microsoft products for 30 years and am now considering moving away from all things Microsoft as much as possible.  I hope Microsoft doen't ruin to many peoples Christmas but from what I have experienced CNN will be showing crying men & children wandering the street Christmas morning

So, for what it's worth, here are some things I've learned about the Samsung Chromebook, either by conducting my own experiments or by finding the info in the nether regions of the internet...1.  Bluetooth:  Yes, just as advertised, you CAN pair the Chromebook up to a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse.  You CANNOT at this time, however, pair it up to a Bluetooth audio device.  This fact is not very well publicized and, the first day I was goofing around with the Chromebook, I couldn't understand why it would pair up to my iHome iDM8 bluetooth speaker for about two seconds, and then just as quickly unpair again.This issue (#204431) has been fixed, and when the Chromebook automatically updates to stable Chrome OS milestone/release 28, Bluetooth audio should be enabled.  Stable release/milestone 27 came out on 23 May 2013.  This means that, since stable versions of Chrome OS are released roughly every three months, stable milestone/release 28 should be available by about 23 August 2013.In the meantime, if you want to switch to the beta or unstable developer release/milestone of Chrome OS to see if bluetooth audio works on your Chromebook, you can do this by doing the following:a)  click on the bottom right hand side of the screen where the time, wifi signal, etc. are shown.b)  click on "settings"c)  click on "help"d)  click on "more info".  (Fyi:  this screen also shows you the release/milestone of Chrome OS you are currently running...)e)  under "channel", click on the release of Chrome OS you want to use (Stable, Beta, or Dev-Unstable)2.  Which formats are the USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports on the Chromebook capable of reading?  I could find absolutely no information anywhere on the internet about this topic, so I had to do my own testing to find the answer.  Using an ADATA 16GB USB 3.0 flash drive for the test, I formatted the flash drive to FAT32, NTFS, and Ext3/Ext4.  The Samsung Chromebook was able to read the flash drive formatted to each of these formats with no problem.  I also plugged an RCA MP3 player formatted to FAT16 into the Chromebook's USB 2.0 port, and it was able to read the format and all of the mp3 files on the device flawlessly.3.  Video Playback:  According to the manual, the Chromebook can only play MP4 video files.  However, as unlikely as it would seem, quite a few people on the internet have mentioned that they were able to take MKV video files, simply change the file extension to MP4, and then play the files on their Chromebook.Here's what I found to be true, at least as far as my particular Chromebook goes:I used the movie "Branded" and transcoded it to MKV, codec H.264, 1690Kbps variable Bitrate, AAC/165Kbps audio, 852 x 480 resolution.  I then formatted the ADATA 16GB USB 3.0 flash drive to NTFS and copied the transcoded movie onto it.  The Chromebook was unable to play the file.  I then changed the file extension to MP4 and tried to play it again.  Once again, the Chromebook was unable to play the file.  I then transcoded the movie to MP4 and tried to play it.  The Chromebook was able to play that file with no problem.Bottom line here:  My Chromebook can only play video files which have been fully transcoded to MP4 format.4.  Video Playback from Google Drive:  Uploaded the transcoded MP4 copy of "Branded" to Google Drive.  The Chromebook was able to play the file via Google Drive Viewer with no problems.5.  Google Cloud Print:  There are two ways to print from this Chromebook.  The first is to buy a cloud-ready printer.  I don't know much about these printers, but it looks like the cheapest ones run about $60.  The other way is to use another computer with Google Chrome Browser installed on it.  I tried this method, and was (no joke) able to set up Google Cloud Print and print a test page from my Chromebook in under two minutes.The details:  My desktop computer dual-boots Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04 operating systems.  It has two printers hooked up to it, an HP Deskjet 3521 and a Brother HL-2230.  Although it specifies in the Chromebook instructions that you must use a Mac or Windows PC, I set up Google Cloud Print using Ubuntu with no difficulty, and was able to print on both printers.Here are the steps for setting up Google Cloud Print:a)  Open the Google Chrome browserb) Click on the little icon at the top right-hand side of the screen that has three little lines on it.c) Click on "settings"d) Scroll all the way down and click on "Show Advanced Settings"e) Click on "Google Cloud Print"f)  Sign in to your Google accountg)  Click on "Add Printers"h)  Click on "Add All Printers"Remember, whenever you print using this method, your other computer needs to be on (not asleep or hibernating...).6.  Streaming Video:  Tried streaming the pilot episode of "Breaking Bad" via Netflix, Amazon Video and Google Play Movies.  It looked great on Netflix and Amazon Video but, strangely, it stopped and buffered so often on Google Play Movies that it was not watchable.  I tried this several times over the course of a couple of days and got the same results each time.7.  ODF documents (.ODT, .ODS, .ODP):  Installed OpenDocument Reader from the Chrome Web Store and was able to view all my LibreOffice ODF documents, both the downloaded ones and the ones stored on Google Drive and Dropbox.  This is a read-only feature, though.  If you want to edit one of these documents, you'll need to upload it to Google Drive and make sure that you have enabled "Convert uploaded files to Google Docs format" in Google Drive settings.  Alternatively, you can use the "LibreOffice on rollApp" app from the Chrome Web Store.  The app seems to work pretty well.8.  How to see the file size of a file on Google Drive after you've uploaded it:On Google Drive, in the upper right-hand side of the screen, click on "sort", then click on "quota used".9.  Other observations:a)  Kindle Cloud Reader works great on the Chromebook; and, yes, you can download Kindle ebooks for offline reading.b)  You get 100GB of cloud storage for two years for free on Google Drive when you buy a Chromebook.  The two years doesn't necessarily start the day you buy the Chromebook.  It starts the day you sign up for the 100GB.  When the two years are up, you will not lose the stuff you uploaded to Google Drive.  You'll always be able to access your data even after the two years are up.  You just won't be able to add any more data to Google Drive unless you choose to buy more storage.c)  Downloading music from both Google Play and Amazon onto the Chromebook is very easy, and it's almost instantaneous. (Seems to be much faster than downloading to Windows PC or Android tablet...)d)  How to turn on Caps Lock:  Alt-Searche)  This Chromebook has a matte screen instead of a glossy screen.  This means that there is almost no glare, but the picture might not look quite as vivid as it would on a glossy screen.  Personally, I'd prefer the matte screen on this thing over the glossy screen on my Windows 8 Laptop any day...f)  The Chromebook has a pre-installed file manager that is just called "files".  It usually automatically opens when you insert a drive into one of the USB ports.  You can also bring it up by selecting the "files" icon in the Chromebook's app manager.  "Files" works fine, but it would be nice if there were other file managers, such as Android's ES File Explorer or XPlorer, available for the Chromebook.  It would also be nice if there were media player apps available for it that could play MKV video files.  We're still in the early days of Chrome OS development, so it wouldn't be surprising at all if apps such as these become available in the near future.g) Yes, the battery is supposed to be easily replaceable if you're willing to take the bottom cover off by removing a few screws.9.  Things I'd like to know about the device, but haven't had a chance to research yet:a)  How fast can the Chromebook write to a USB 3.0 drive?b)  I know you can't use a portable external hard drive with it, but can you use an external desktop hard drive with its own power supply with the Samsung Chromebook?c)  Can you use an external DVD USB drive with it?I'll update this review if/when I find the answers to these questions or find out any other interesting tidbits of information about this Chromebook...Hope the above information has helped you in some way.  Enjoy your Chromebook.  Imho, It's well worth the $250.Update:  Plugged my 120GB WD USB 2.0 portable external hard drive into it.  Was surprised when the Chromebook recognized the drive and played audio/video files from it with no problems. Thanks to Dr. Mark Tweedie for replying to let me know that his Chromebook could recognize his Seagate external hard drive...

$review_text.: I wanted a super small but robust flash drive that I could carry in my wallet and this one fit the bill perfectly.  I use a free program called TrueCrypt to create an encrypted folder on this flash drive and within the folder I keep all my personal data such as photocopies of my credit cards, drivers licence, passport, along with a full list of all my passwords.  This way I know that wherever I am it'll be possible to access this important information if necessary - so long as I have access to a PC.  This flash drive is so small that I think it's a good idea to tape it to one  of my credit cards that I rarely use so it won't get lost.  Highly recommended.PS -  It's not the speediest flash drive you'll find, but that isn't important to me.

$REVIEW.: I didn't like it's performance.  A bit sluggish at best. I usually assign the scrolling wheel to be used as a double click, but in this case it just did not work all that well. The wheel rolls too freely and it is hard to make it double click that way.  Even when it did work it was not fast.  There is no way to adjust for speed in any way. Getting to the menu for options is not intuitive as well.  After having found it and selecting its different functions, it does not tell you that these settings have been accepted before leaving that page.Its shape, however, is good. It feels comfortable holding it.But, hey, just my opinion. Others might like it.

$REVIEW.: I bought this keyboard cover a while ago and I use it on a daily basis (rarely do I write in Arabic) but I use it as a cover every day. The complaints people are making are usually because of user error and not error of the product with the exception of the backlight. No, you cannot see the letters at night/in the dark.In regards to the letters "being in the wrong place" They're not.These keyboard was designed for Apple's operating system, not Windows. Thats 1.2) There are 3 Arabic keyboards to choose from in your Language and text input preferences in your APPLE OS:"Arabic" &lt;&lt;--- this is the correct one"Arabic - PC" and"Arabic - QWERTY"if you use the other two, the letters will not be in the same places as indicated on the cover.

The only problem I have is forgetting to turn it off when I am not using the computer

I also don't care for the buttons on the side since I have a small hand and have a tendancy to hit them by accident


Not a huge problem as nothing usually happens when I do

I did not realize that it doesn't work if you turn off the wireless on a laptop but just had to turn the switch back on and it started working right away.

I'm not sure if it's &#34;leather&#34; or &#34;pleather&#34;..


but it feels like good-quality leather in any case
Stays upright nicely while alternating between touch-screen and typing
I like the magnetic &#34;grip&#34; of the keyboard: stays in place well, but easy to pull off

Perhaps it's been redesigned, but comments that you can't charge keyboard in place are inaccurate - Micro-usb port is on side and totally accessible while mounted
As others have said, the keyboard is small, but that's a function of the tablet size - it's as big as it -can- be..

 Very usable once you get used to it, and SO nice to have real keys rather than a &#34;membrane&#34; style
Very pleased indeed.

$REVIEW.: Installed the card in a home-built Freenas box, then tried to find an update to the on-board firmware at Silicon Graphics - Couldn't find one that worked in Windows or DOS. None of the choices from the text menus seemed to match the actual board type. Pressed on despite the lack of update, and Freenas recognized the drives just fine. I setup a software Z-Raid array of 4 drives with no problems. (To avoid the usual problems with software Raid arrays, my boot drive was a more reliable CF IDE drive).The card has worked with no problems for the past month - I have fiddled with my array a few times and even rebuilt the array once as an experiment to see what a future disk failure would look like. As long as you are aware of the disk-size limitations, this is a VERY affordable raid card for old Sata Drives under 500GB.

$review_text.: I've just recently got the Logitech Table Keyboard for Android 3.0+. This is my second bluetooth keyboard, and I can say this one was much easier to connect to my device. It was in fact, simple. I won't repeat the things other have said. Rather I'll add my biggest notes:First, while this was labeled for Android 3.0+, I'm actually using it on a Samsung Windows 8 Tablet. I've not seen any issues to this point. As I mentioned, set up was a matter of clicking to search for bluetooth devices, turning on the keyboard, and then clicking on the keyboard icon when it showed. The keyboard then just worked.My second comment is the more interesting. They keyboard is relatively light. It is about the same weight as the others I've seen. The stand is pretty light as well. I liked the stand because it works as a protective case for the keyboard when you are carrying it around, plus when you use the keyboard, you generally want to prop up the slate. That is a big plus. What is odd - and it just might be me - is that while the stand and keyboard each seem light, when you put the two together, there is a notable amount of weight. I'd even say it is heavy. It is definitely notable in added weight to carry around when you have both pieces.
$SUMMARY.: Great device. bit heavy

$REVIEW.: So far, so good - I've only charged the batteries a couple of times, but for the price paid, they seem to be good so far.  As with many products that I review, my primary complaint is the shipping charge...  why not just charge the price that you want to make and then a shipping charge that approximates actual postage?  UPDATE - I had to replace these batteries after less than a year of use when they stopped holding charges for long.  Even at this price, that makes them too expensive.

It took great videos!  Love being able to snap a pic while videoing!  Can't say e ought about this camera.

It does not have a setting for the old 78's... unfortunate, but you get what you pay for.The -1 star isn't for that, though. The player I received occasionally starts up automatically without pressing a button. This happens intermittently when I plug it in. Most likely faulty wiring or poor craftsmanship. It's not particularly worrying, but I do fear it could damage the needle if it starts without a record on the player.

$review_text.: The Kindle Fire is my third Kindle; I have a K1 and a K3 (now a Kindle Keyboard, I suppose). The K1 came with a case, and I bought the lighted leather case to go with the K3. It's important to have a great case to go with an amazing device.I bought this sleeve for my Kindle Fire, after looking around a bit at different options. I originally wanted to find a case that would allow me to prop the Fire up and watch videos, similar to many popular iPad cases. At this point, the products offered aren't well reviewed, so I'm content to wait until a good one is out there.In the meantime, I definitely wanted to protect my Fire from Things that Go Bump in the Purse, so I bought this handy-dandy little sleeve. I didn't expect much, and I actually got more than I expected. The Fire fits snugly inside the sleeve, as several other reviewers have noted. There is enough padding that I feel comfortable that the device is well-protected in my purse -- but not so much that it adds a lot of bulk, which is great. And the inside of the sleeve is a super-soft, almost furry bright pink cloth that both protects and wipes fingerprints from the Fire as I put it in and take it out of the sleeve.Will this be my always-and-forever Kindle Fire cover? I seriously doubt it. But for now, it's doing exactly what I hoped it would do, and more, and at a reasonable price. I'm pleased with my purchase.

$REVIEW.: I thought I was ordering two different styles of glasses - as shown in the photo on the product page. But instead I got two pairs of the clip-on style glasses. Which is actually fine with me - the clip-on pair was the main reason for me placing this order.The glasses I got are well made, and they work fine with the 3D images I've tried them out on (haven't tried them with any 3D videos yet though). They should last a long time - but keep in mind that they don't look like they would stand up to a lot of physical abuse. Except for the main metal clip, the rest of the glasses are made of plastic. I could see these getting easily broke if someone were to sit/step on them.I tried these on a couple different pairs of eyeglasses and they fit pretty good. The clip portion does rest on the lens, but the prongs are padded with rubber so that shouldn't be a problem with occasional use.All-in-all I'm happy with these glasses.ETA: Noticed reading some of the other reviews that there are comments about the colored lenses seem a bit dark - my guess for that is the thickness of the plastic - I measured it to be a bit over .05" in thickness. Compared to the thin colored film used for typical cardboard 3D glasses, that is pretty thick. Thicker colored plastic would result in the glasses being a bit more dark.ETA2: Something I overlooked at the time of purchase. This order was suppose to ship free - but I had it sent to my PO Box and didn't notice that a shipping charge was applied because of that. Totally my own fault - usually when that happens I use my work address instead. Just thought I would mention it to keep anyone else from making that mistake.

$REVIEW.: After a lot of reviews on various products, I decided the newest Flip Mino with the mechanical image stabilization was the best choice.  I've seen too many home videos that bounced and jiggled so much that they were just a shame.  That was the selling point for this 3rd generation model.  Mechanical stabilization with internal gyroscopes work!  Sure it won't remove blatant crazy movements, but it will get rid of the jiggling.  I even gave it to my 3 yr old to walk around with and it came back looking darn smooth.  Bought a super small camera case and I keep this thing with me.  Couldn't do that with my older DV tape camcorder.  Brought the old one to Disney and never used it once.  Too big a hassle.  That's when I said enough is enough and got this super small unit.  Images look great with adequate lighting though low lighting could be better.  Battery may be sealed, but if I get 3-4 good years out of it I'm happy.  Bought a skin to snazzy up the outside rather boring appearance as well.  Get one!

$review_text.: There's not much I can add to the title. This shell is cheap both in terms of price and in terms of quality. It's pretty enough (for a while at least) and has decent fit, but under even light impacts it will crack.The problem is this thing is made of polycarbonate. That's the same stuff they make CDs out of, and it is very prone to cracking. It actually doesn't even take an impact to crack this case, especially since the thing has a really tight fit- just letting it sit around, one corner developed spiderweb cracks after about a month of use.The feel of the case is nice, and it's a nice color. And yeah, it's not expensive- but you really get what you pay for.

$review_text.: TP-Link TL-WDR3600 N600 wireless router is a good performer. The router is flat but larger than the competitors models. It has a semi-glossy surface with a row of blue LED indicators in the front and 2 adjustable antennas at the back. The antennas are detachable which allow for stronger, custom antenna upgrades. The wireless radio can be turned on/off with a physical switch at the back of the unit. The router has a master On/Off switch next to the power connector, which is really convenient when you need to power off the router without messing with the power connector especially when the router is placed in a confined cabinet space. It is also wall-mountable.The performance of the TL-WDR3600 is good. It didn't hang nor drop a wireless connection in the couple of weeks that I have it up and running. Throughput is about the same as that of the Linksys E3000 that I have running with DD-WRT. I don't see any connection problem with my MacBook Pro, Dell notebook, iPhone/iPod, Sony BD player and Netgear media player.The router supports storage (Samba) sharing, FTP server, media server and printer server. I tested the media server with a portable HDD connected to one of the 2 USB ports at the back. My HDTV was able to connect to it and play the media. However, I don't think the media server is DLNA compliant as it's not listed in the DLNA website. My Brother printer is already wireless and therefore I didn't test the printer server.The administration web interface of the router has a lot of features and configuration options. Too many to list in this review. Some of the more important features to me that are configurable are LAN IP address reservation, wireless MAC address filtering, separate 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless configuration, IP QoS, SSID broadcast disable, port forwarding and DMZ. It also has some features to parental control and user restrictions but I didn't care about it.Pros:- fast, simultaneous dual-band- gigabit WAN and LAN ports- 2 USB 2.0 ports with storage/ftp/media/print servers- IP QoS support- WDS bridging supportCons:- no guest wireless mode- large footprintInternally, TL-WDR3600 uses an Atheros AR9344 chip running at 560MHz with 128MB RAM/8MB flash and an Atheros AR9580 SOC for Wi-Fi. It is DD-WRT compatible but flashing with it would probably void the 2-year warranty.In summary, the router has good performance and offers tons of features at a very affordable price point.

$review_text.: Cable is something I haven't had in over seven years. I've saved a lot of money by only using Netflix and Hulu+. However, my SO really wanted to have some sort of 'live' feed going on, insisting we get cable. $75/mo? No thanks.I finally picked up this antenna after my parents were able to pick up two stations in the middle of the woods in a rambler house. Our townhouse is on a hill facing two major stations in neighboring cities, so I was sure I could pick up some stations.I plugged in the antennae, mounted it directly to the back of our TV (a bad position for reception but at least you can't see it. Gotta pick your battles.) Did a quick search, and came up with 13 channels!Now, these channels aren't particularly interesting, but I do get HDTV for the news, and other major stations. Local channels, NBC, CNBC, Fox, etc. That's good enough for me, and for under $10 fantastic.My SO hasn't touched it, by the way. Still using Hulu+ for her shows. Go figure.

$review_text.: This is larger than my previous keyboard, but I am used to it and would not want to go back. It has a really nice soft wrist rest, and the keys feel nice. It might not be a suitable keyboard for someone with small hands.The only problem I had was that sometimes when I started up from a long CPU sleep, it wouldn't wake up, I had to unplug the USB receiver and plug it back in. This might have been a conflict with my mouse, which had the slot right above. I moved the USB gizmo for the keyboard to a different port on the side of my computer, and haven't had that problem since.
$SUMMARY.: I'm typing on it right now!

$REVIEW.: I give two stars, one for the making of the inferior product and one for the seller recognizing it(not trying to cover it up) and reimbursing me for purchasing it

After receiving this product I found out nothing lined up(holes) for my Acer 7&#34; tablet as the size seemed to be for maybe a 5.5 or 6-inch(don't know even if there is such a tablet size) tablet but it DEFINITELY didn't fit mine, therefore not protecting the tablet properly.

$review_text.: After taking on roommates a few months back, my consumer-grade wireless router just couldn't keep up with the traffic from almost twice as many wireless devices as I'd had living with just my girlfriend. Enter the UniFi AP!Physical installation was super simple thanks to the included hardware. I'm a bit concerned that the POE injector is proprietary, but I guess I'll deal with that if it ever dies on me.On the software side of things, setup and installation started off rocky, but once I got the right software installed it sent pretty well. I had to spend a few minutes getting used to the web-based admin UI but once I had the lay of the land I was able to get a new wireless network up and running in minutes.Some things of note:- You need to have the Unifi admin software running on a PC in order to access the web UI. This program is ONLY required for setup or monitoring, the AP itself does its job regardless of whether or not this software is running.- You'll probably need to adjust the power output. At default &#34;Strongest&#34; setting (I think it said it was 20dB) the wireless network stretched more than 100ft, covering not only my apartment building, but the three surrounding apartment buildings and part of the parking lot as well. I bumped it down to Medium (around 5dB) and according to the admin software's range map the signal didn't extend much further than my individual apartment.

$review_text.: Been using it for a couple of months and it works fine for my Yoga 13.  I like the fact its smaller and more compact than the stock adapter..  I haven't experienced any heat issues that another reviewer mentioned when using it on their Yoga. However, I do tend to leave mine plugged the majority of the time so it doesn't go through extensive charge cycles.  Its feels warm to the touch when charging.One minus is the adapter comes with a three prong plug vs the 2 prong on the stock adapter.  The three prong can be harder to find a plug at times.

$REVIEW.: I have a small intous4 and since the day I got it, I've been worried of scratching it. I used the intous4 for just 2 hours and I had already spotted my first scratch and nib worn out. I was worried at first but after looking at intous4 forum, EVERYONE complained the same thing and the only thing today is to replace the surface sheet and the nibs more often as well as using the pen VERY lightly. That ruined my fun with the intous4 and hated it ever since because of getting scratched. I bought this thinking what the hell might as well try it. Put it, and now my intous4 surface is so smooth and you don't feel any friction at all. My pen nibs haven't changed at all, even after drawing for a week in comparison to changing after 2-4 hours of use.Now for the CONS; I have noticed a slight drop in pressure sensitivity so you would have to make changes to your pressure sensitivity, even though some might not even notice it at all. Instructions could be a little clear as they don't give you much direction as to what goes first. I had to play around a little before I got it right.Overall, for those who are afraid or thinking twice before buying this, well don't be because it is truly worth every penny.

$review_text.: I bought this about a year after getting my 7D


 Yes, the focus system is not as sophisticated


 This camera came out earlier, and thus its video controls aren't dedicated


 Beyond those 2 things, this camera is my favorite in every other way

 If I'm going somewhere and I'm taking 1 camera, this is the 1
 It does make you want better glass, as it's using the corners more and the higher resolution benefits more from sharper glass

 The video from it is fantastic, though focus is hard to attain at larger apertures


 I have just ordered a Z-Finder in hopes it will make focusing easier

 I love prime lenses and shallow depth of field and for those purposes, this camera is the clear choice over the 7D
 If you are looking for sports and wildlife (particularly birding) the 7D may be the better choice
 This camera can still provide great results in those conditions, but I don't think those things were a focus when they were designing this camera

 Scratch up another $1500 for the new 5D Mark III if you want it all
 If you want the best results for portraits, candids and landscapes that you can get for a reasonable hobby-ist price, this thing is the way to go.A few reasons I pick this up over the 7D are:- slightly better overall image quality.- slightly better depth of field control.- about 1 stop better (lower) noise at high ISO's.If these things are a consideration for you, I don't think you'll be disappointed picking this over the 7D
 Like I said, if you can afford it, I'm sure the 5D3 is the best of both worlds


 But for less money, I've got 2 bodies that do everything I need


 I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this for the conditions I outlined above.

$review_text.: I bought these speakers 3 years ago, and they have been good to me ever since day one. Granted, I was upgrading from an old Cyber Acoustics 2.1 system that was radically underpowered, and is now, after about 4 years of use, quite dead. These Logitech's on the other hand, haven't skipped a beat. To put my love for these speakers into perspective, I'll say this; I went to a boarding school that banned the use of Subwoofers the year after I got these (I may or may not have been implicated as the cause for this ban) and I first flew into a rage, then sat down to fight the tears. That is not a joke, I was so spoiled by these things, that going back to my iHome felt like a war crime. First World Problems, right?The satellites are kind of cool looking, although it's really a matter of opinion. I like the "space-agey" look you get with the covers off, but that might just be me. The covers seem to have very little effect on sound quality, on or off, I can't tell the difference. The cable length has always been fine for me, but my desks (I've used 5-6 different desks with these speakers since I got them, I move around a lot) haven't been particularly large. For computer speakers, they are fine, the sub currently sits below my desk and the two satellites are at the back corners of my desk. Sitting approximately 2-4 feet from the speakers (depends on my seated position) you get a definite left-right separation, when is cool. Watching movies like Flyboys or Red Tails where the planes go shooting across the screen from one side to the other you can actually hear the sound moving from side to side. You can also "feel" it too...This brings me to the subwoofer. All I can say is Oh. My. God. The God of Low Frequencies must have possessed the bodies of the designers, because this thing does it all. I've run all kinds of LF tests found online (not the youtube rap video ones where the rapper repeats something about bass over and over, but the actual up-and-down test of all the frequencies) and it gets dangerous. At approximately 45% volume (I dare not go louder for fear of my neighbors calling the cops) every painting in my house is rattling against the wall, and the floor shakes. When certain objects (mainly air duct vents, but others as well) hit resonant frequencies, they vibrate quite loudly, and all I can do is laugh. My dad has a full on 5.1 surround system with a top-of-the-line receiver and a decent sub and it can't compare to these. The power output is unreal.As for sound quality, I'm no snob, but I know the difference between quality and cheap stuff. The base can be a bit overwhelming, but that's why the smarties at Logitech put a "Bass" knob on the control pod. I like to turn the bass all the way down at night to keep from bothering others, put it a little below half for movies, at half for music, and at 3/4 when I want to piss of my sisters. Otherwise, everything is crystal clear. The high's and mid's are well defined, and the bass is boomy, but still tight and responsive. I've only heard one set of computer speakers that sounds better (and having lived in dorms for a while, I've listened to quite a few) and those are the Logitech Z-5500's, but let's be honest, those sit in a class all their own.As for build quality, I can say these can take a beating. I've moved them around my house, and from dorm to house numerous times, more than I care to count, and they look brand new. The satellites are made of a thick, quality plastic that doesn't flex when you squeeze on the sides. The subwoofer is crazy heavy, when I move it I slip one hand into the bass port and the other under the other side, and that's about the only way to do it. But I believe that weight means they put a lot into the magnet, which to me says quality, which is verified by the jaw-dropping quality of the sound produced.One thing of note, the sub has a giant heatsink on the back, and when I first saw this, I thought, "Oh no, overheating problems." I was wrong. After watching all three LotR movies back to back with the speakers cranked up (Do this with the Helmsdeep Battle Scene from Two Towers, it's awesome) I felt the heatsink, and it was only slightly above room temp. Super impressed.These speakers will continue to be used until the day they stop working, and on that day, I think I really will cry. The only speakers I would even consider replacing these with, are the Z-5500's (way overpriced since they were discontinued) or their successors, the Z903's.I got these speakers for $125, and at that price they are a steal. They compete with other systems 2x-3x that price. Since they've been discontinued however, the price has gone up. Even used systems go for well above MSRP, which should tell you how nice they are. If you can't find these for less than $130, go with the Z623's, which were set to succeed these. I haven't heard them personally, but they get similar reviews, and it looks like they are very comparable in quality. From my father's grumbling about the quality of the speakers on his flat screen in his living room, it sounds like he intends to buy the Z623's, so I will update this review with a quick comparison if he does.Overall, these speakers are amazing. They might not please an audiophile, but if you're not looking to drop $500 on a HQ Amplifier and another $300-$400 on bookshelf speakers, this is an excellent option, especially for a computer setup. I use these for movies, video games, music, everything, and I have never, not once, wished for anything more than these give me. If you can find 'em at a decent price these days, they are more than worth it.

$REVIEW.: I got this Surface RT (16gb) during the Black Friday sales, for $250 at BestBuy (without a touch cover)

I have since bought a limited edition blue skulls design touch cover, as well as got a very good deal on a black TYPE Cover on eBay
So far, the Touch Cover has been much nicer than I expected


I thought the flat surface would be too hard to get used to, but amazingly, I have not made ANY typing mistakes, and I don't have to move slowly or make sure that I press each key

It seems to go very smoothly when I type just as fast as I do on my regular laptop

Not to mention the blue color and skulls artistic design is quite sharp! I have used this keyboard almost the whole time, and the Type Cover has been put away


Those who say to get the Type Cover must not have given a Touch Cover much of a chance
The only real positive difference in using a Type Cover would be if you desire the key-sounds and clicking of each key
I personally enjoy the quiet typing on my Touch Cover better.I bought this tablet because of the obvious perks of having the detachable keyboard, and the smooth, heavy-duty metal casing on the tablet, along with the handy USB port and expandable storage, as well as the key features I was looking for

I like the larger size, instead of the usual 7&#34; tablets
I am a loyal Windows user, but it is taking a while to try and get used to the very different Windows 8 RT interface
I wish I could make the Surface accept a Win7 OS.The WORST part about having the RT operating system, is that it will NOT accept any of the usual programs or allow you to install anything unless it comes from the very limited Microsoft App Store
I have had a very difficult time with finding good 'apps' to replace the programs I am used to using, especially a decent video player that will play more than just the .mp4 format
I also wanted to have PC games on my tablet that I already have on my PC, but I cannot install any of them

This program restriction is the Surface Tablet's biggest downfall.I have read on some website descriptions of this product (Walmart site being one of them) that after updating to Win8.1, the Surface can now run ANY programs that will run on Win7


I am confused by this, because the Surface has NEVER been able to run regular programs, as it will not allow any installation of anything using a .exe or other file extension

All it will do is allow you to browse the Windows Apps and select which of those to install
If ANYONE knows any more about this claim, please comment and let me know!So far, I haven't used my Surface for more than 12 hours since I bought it, and all the disappointments have turned me off of the excitement I had in first opening the box and trying it.I would give the operation and use of the tablet a 4/10.The sharp style, outer design, and nice keyboard options, as well as the VERY nice multi-use USB port, the availability of the expandable storage with the included micro-SD slot, and the handy 'kick-stand' on the back, I would give a 8/10.

$REVIEW.: So you know my usage and expectations I am primarily a First Person Shooter gamer

 For these reasons one of the most important factors is a mouse and keyboard capable of keeping up


 After days of research my options came down to the Logitech G5 and a Razor product.The customizable weights for the mouse were the primary attraction, till I found out too late it is offered in the other mice as well

 The middle mouse button offers a tilt left and tilt right feature, which I have yet to be able to use in either gaming or browsing (which it is intended for)
 Installation of the drivers and software created an additional unforgivable problem with several games, usually when I multitask


 Here and now in the middle of a game the left mouse button will freeze up, the computer will not register the clicks for a good five minutes unless you Tab out and click-frenzy until it picks up
 This is disorienting and devastating in the middle of any time crucial situation.In favor of the G5 the feel and size, as well as button build are fantastic (for right handers)
The optical reading is great, never twitchy, and the on the fly sensitivity buttons are easy to reach and use

 The mouse wheel and left click problems probably could be solved with an update from the Logitech site or a re-installation of the drivers, but with the amount of money it cost for just the mouse, I'm disappointed if it doesn't work right out of the box


 If I want to spend a day driver hunting and troubleshooting I'd rather not blow near $50 for the hardware homework
I'm avoiding the G7 as well since my friend hates his(low battery life)


 Overall I think you'll be getting a much better review from me on the competitors gaming mouse.July 2010:  3 years and its still going strong
Setup has gotten easier with recent OS updates, thankfully, works great on W7
Its starting to feel a little improperly sized for my medium hands and I do get cramps occasionally, the mouse wheel isnt as sensitive as I'd like for some games, and I rarely even use the on the fly sensitivity, though I still find it impressive.

Works just fine after the Toshiba Bluetooth Stack software/driver are installed. I also did the install the printer driver manually from the Device Manager list on the PC and selecting Canon as the manufacturer and locating the associated driver.Canon  Pixma MP470 Printer:When hooked up to the printer, I can print from another floor down (so about 40-50 ft) with my old macbook OSX. It also works with another *cheaper* dongle attached to the PC upstairs (being maybe 30 ft from the printer?). The cheaper dongle has half the range and wouldn't work plugged into the printer, even when I had the macbook sitting a few feet away from the printer. Whereas this one worked upon plugging in. I had to hard-reset the printer once, but it's worked fine since then.Bluetooth OontZ Curve Speaker:When hooked up to the PC with Windows 7 64-bit, this dongle also has about 15-20 foot range with the OontZ Curve speaker, but basically has to stay in the same room. The speaker gets static before reaching a different floor level. Also, the OontZ speaker says it's missing a &#34;Bluetooth Peripheral Device&#34; out of 7 functions listed under properties&#62;hardware. It still plays, and I don't know what that driver is for. I ended up manually installing the &#34;Bluetooth MTP Device Enumerator&#34;, but haven't noticed any changes in performance.

$review_text.: Pros:- Blazing fast speed- Super-easy Setup- Remote access from anywhere- Prettiest UI ever on a router- Free phone apps- Better looking design than a Netgear or D-link- Cutting-edge Cloud goodnessCons:- Bigger physically than previous generation of routers (still smaller than other AC routers)- Although the HW design is more attractive than competitors, it is not quite as sleek Cisco's less powerful EA4500.- Did have to reboot a couple times in recent weeks (or is this a Pro, because it can done remotely from Cloud app?)- Speed Test gives very different speeds than reliable services like TestMy.netMy Experience:Previously I had an EA4500, which was fantastic

 But, in thinking ahead to future electronic device purchases, it seemed like an AC router was needed to "future-proof" my home.Initially I purchased the Netgear AC router because it was the only one available

 It was respectable for speed, but I sorely missed my Cisco Cloud apps, so the second the EA6500 came out, the Netgear got returned.Performance:Fast, really fast

 I only have all N devices at home now, so I'm looking for even more impressive stuff when I add AC devices

 There were a few times when the speed bogged down, and a reboot was needed
 Since this the first rev of new router technology, I'm not to put off by this

 (Cisco has already released some patches with improvements.)Recommendation:Buy this router if you value performance, think HW &SW; should be a thing of beauty, and have a mindset capable of embracing the awesomeness that is the Cloud


 Keep firmware auto-update ON, and you should years of stable use out of this router.

$REVIEW.: I disagree that the adapter will help fringing issue or vignetting. For all I care it is making the G12 looks more SLR like for grip or handling, the adapter adding to the camera some more weight while taking away its pocketability. I still like the enhanced cosmetic outlook this adapter offers to the G12 overall, although I am a bit annoyed that the viewfinder will be obstructed partially bc of it. Further, what puzzles me is that this adapter when mounted with a front filter, will likely to generate glares or unwanted reflections in the resulting photo when the shots are taken at night with external sources of light interferencing with the G12 own flash. So except for the good feel and cosmetic addition (including its ability to extend forth w/ your G12 zooming lens), this adapter does not amount much to any useful functionality. Am not recommending this to everybody, yet for cosmetic reasons of my own I will keep it. thus, it's my excuse that a too lenient four-stars rating is given; i.e. it more reasonably deserves a tiny bit over 3 stars.

$review_text.: The labeling of this item (SanDisk Ultra II 16 GB SDHC card) is very confusing. On the front side it claims a maximum speed of 15MB/sec. At the same time, it is marketed as 'Class-4' (which means a minimum read/write speed of just 4MB/s). To move up to a 'class-6' card from the same manufacturer, you have to buy theSanDisk 16gb Extreme III SDHC cardwhich costs 2-3 times more.I decided to take a chance with this Ultra II card, even though my newCanon EOS Rebel T1iexplicitly requires a 'Class-6' card for video capture. I'm happy to report that the card is fast enough to keep up with my camera, even in burst mode and in 1080 HD video mode.My own benchmark (see 'Customer Images') revealed that the read speed of this card is consistently fast at 18-19MB/s. But its write speed is strongly dependent on the data file size:- For small files of 1MB each, the card is only able to write at about 6MB/s. That means it qualifies as a borderline 'class-6'.- For typical photo files (4-6MB each), the write speed is much faster at around 10MB/s.- When writing a huge file of 1GB, the card can actually achieve the claimed maximum speed of 15MB/s.The SanDisk Ultra II may not be a good choice if you want to use it as a ReadyBoost device (frequent writing of smaller file). But when used in digital cameras, this 'class-4' card is just as fast or even faster than other brands of 'class-6' cards (such as theTranscend 16 GB SDHC Class 6, which levels off at 11MB/s for large files). This makes the Ultra II a great value - especially for those people who prefer to stay with a trusted name brand.[Update on Nov 18, 2011]At the time of my original review, this Sandisk Ultra card was marketed as a 'class-4', while the Extreme card was called a 'class-6'. But now the Ultra is called 'class-6' while the Extreme is 'class-10'. I strongly suspect it is just marketing people playing tricks with definitions of 'class-4/6/10'.

$review_text.: These are going back. I question some of the reviews here.Pros:-Heavy but comfortable-Smart screw on 3/4" adapter head-Sleek look-Outside noise reduced a good amount, but-Cons:-1980s 99 cent store sound quality. Absolutely terrible. That's why I question some of the reviews here. There is zero treble, the mids are amped up and bass muffles very quickly if you try to boost from an EQ. I have a flat EQ from a Denon receiver and it's the same on my phone.

$review_text.: Overall, the BTP04 speaker is the rugged product that it is said to be.  I got this with the adventure pack, and I was astounded at the accessories that came out of the box: two wrist straps (the kind you'd find on cameras to keep from droppping it), a carabiner, two drawstring bags, charging/connection cable, cigarette lighter USB charger, wrist strap mount, bicycle handlebar mount, and suction cup mount.  I wonder why they didn't toss in an A/C USB charger as well.  I joke that this was $50 speaker with $100 of accessories.I took a lot of photos that I intend to post with the review.The speaker quickly and easily connected via Bluetooth to my Kindle Fire HD, my wife's iTouch, and to my Nokia (dumb) phone (the first time.) Note that is a wireless speaker running off of batteries.  It is not capable of sociopathic levels of sound.  It will not provide music for your beach party, or make the whole neighborhood rumble when used in your car.  It is for personal use.  It worked quite well when suctioned to the top of the windshield in front of me for listening to music from the Kindle.  Compared to the Kindle's built in speakers, I did not perceive more volume when cranked all the way up, although the sound quality was better, especially with the additional bass.  Mounted to a bicycle handlebar, it will let you listen to tunes without the dangerous, it not illegal, use of headphones.The speaker has a standard 1/4" tripod mount screw in the bottom.  This is used to attach to most of the accessory mounts.I was pleased to find that it had a microphone, as well, and could be used as a hands-free device for the cell phone.  Sound quality using the microphone was excellent.Although I did not test it this fashion, it can be plugged into a stereo and used as a Bluetooth receiver, feeding the audio to the stereo instead of to the speaker.I was generally pleased overall with the product, but must always provide my nitpicks - areas for improvement.The charging cord is very short.  I had to stand the speaker on end on the floor to reach the USB charger plugged into a standard height A/C outlet.  In this orientation, you can't see the charging lights because they are facing the floor.  if I put it on my end table, I don't think the cord would reach down to the outlet.  The cord was also very thin.  It doesn't seem like it would take much of a snag to break it.  Since it is special to this product (it's not just a USB charging cord, but also has an 1/8" audio plug), I wonder how easy getting a replacement would be.The Bluetooth and volume buttons are flush under the rubber on one end, so are hard to see even in the light.  With time, I imagine one will learn to push for the controls.  On the other end, the switch and plugs are covered with a rubber flap.  If you have fingernails like me, you will be pulling out your pocketknife to open the flap every time you want to turn it on or off.  It also seems that they oriented the flap in such a direction as to make it most difficult to reach with your fingernail.The suction cup mount worked quite well in the truck.  It has a ratcheting feature, and you must be sure to completely release it before applying it to the glass.  The bicycle mount was kind of huge but easy to use.  It did not really fit on my road bike bars along with the computer and GPS mounts, though.  If you have flat bars, you'll probably have an easier time mounting it.  The wrist strap mount is a complete mystery to me.  I can't think of any activity in which I'd want a 5/8 lb. speaker strapped to my wrist.Again, these are just nits.  Overall, I was quite pleased with the quality of build and performance of this speaker.

$review_text.: Love using this at some hotels that are weird and just can't be bothered to provide wireless, plus it works great at home.Pros:- Very small. I can throw it in my bag and it doesn't take up much space.- Great design. It looks more than a little bit like an Apple product. I'm OK with that, as it is stylish.- Swivel out plug, so it doesn't scratch anything else in the bag with it. A little used feature that would be a huge benefit for many other products.- Allows me to share one access line with multiple devices. Having stayed in a few hotels with only wired internet recently, this was huge - I could actually use my iPad / iPhone!Cons:- The manual, instructions, everything - well, it works, but you better know what you're doing.

$review_text.: Over the last two years I've been trying different camera straps. I have a fairly heavy Canon DSLR and coupled with a long heavy zoom lens, it feels like an anchor around your neck. I started with just a nicer padded normal neck strap, and after I didn't love that, I moved on to the black rapid strap. Again, didn't love it. So for a while, I had nothing on the camera, but I was getting worried about accidentally dropping it, so I got a hand strap that also had a wrist strap that you velcro'd yourself into. It was better than having something around my neck, but it wasn't convenient. Then I found this and FINALLY -- I'm totally happy. It's unobtrusive, feels very well made, and easy to get in and out of. I was worried that this wouldn't be able to support the weight of my camera but like I said, it feels well made. The strap that actually goes around the loops on your camera is a heavy duty nylon-ish material (not elastic like I was expecting) and the clip is fastened to the neoprene with a piece of leather and heavy duty stitching. I feel more secure carrying this and not having to worry about accidentally dropping my camera.
$SUMMARY.: I finally found a camera strap I LOVE!!

$REVIEW.: I tried the reasonably priced Vivitek D510 for business presentations and home theater, but found it lacking in picture quality for both purposes


 Its 800x600 native resolution didn't display a crisp image for small text reading on a 50" screen

 It also failed to produce a reasonably good image from any home theater media

 Especially notable was its screen door effect and lousy color accuracy


 Its down scaling abilities from high definition sources was miserable by creating blotchy colored faces and images

 While its low cost may be attractive for non-critical classroom use, I would recommend home theater users to research for a higher native resolution projector designed for that purpose.

$review_text.: I do like the video options the slow motion is fun. The pics are what your would expect from the small sensor but the colors are a little too washed out- that's better than too much red as many of the others put out even with adjustments in a photo program red is the hardest to fix. The price is excellent! I only bought this as a hiking back up for pics that I just wanted quick shots of. If your expecting pro shots like some reviews its never going to happen- my other camera and lens cost 5000 and they are excellent but still not full frame professional! As for this vs a Canon or Nikon at twice the money this is it! If you do decide to spend 500 get a SLR and some cheap lens you will never get close to 50 times zoom but your pics will rock! Oh and mine came with a defective battery so I bought some from Amazon again one was a defective after market so I bought two more higher end ones and I'm still waiting to see if they are any good. I would of returned the camera but like I said for the price you won't beat it and it's only the battery- I carry 2 to 3 anyway with any camera.

$review_text.: Thank you Seagate for putting this product on the market! Since Apple will not give me an SD slot where I can play my own video, this is the next best thing
First of all this is not an MP3 player yet, it does play MP3's but the user interface has a ways to go

The lack of playlists means you should really not plan to use this as you ipod substitue at this time


However, if you are like me where you have a pretty good video collection, maybe somewhere that does not have decent internet or 3G connections and want an Itunes free way of storing/playing videos then this is the product for you! There as still some issues as are seen in the other reviews, but the majority of my video plays just fine


I now have hours of movies or shows that I can watch when I am exercising or on the road
The ability to share the stream means multiple Ipads or Iphones can be watching different shows off the same drive (too cool)


From what I have seen Seagate is in the process of upgrading the software so that we can expect to see greater functionality in the future


In the meantime I am more than happy to be on the leading edge, and now I do not have to buy a 2nd non-Apple tablet to watch my shows!Update - I had some problems with the embedded player but have found I can cut and paste the links into the app OPlayer HD
If for some reason there are problems with the encoding of the file younare watching, then you can get very annoying hangs that require constant restarts

OPlayer HD seems to do a pretty good job of riding thru any glitches and playing files that might not be perfectly encoded.

It's easy to clean (I accidentally spat on it while eating candy right when I opened it) and works like it's supposed to. There is a slight reddish-magenta color cast that I already read about. It is easy to correct for and sometimes actually adds to the picture! Great filter, if you're thinking about it, DO IT!UPDATE: Filter is really really hard to clean. When I clean it with the same method I use to clean my other filters, the 10 stop streaks and pretty much never gets clean.

$REVIEW.: Shortly after I purchased my first SLR film camera (some time around 1977) I bought a 2X tele-converter hoping to use it with my 70-200 f/4.5-5.6 zoom lens.  It was an off-brand (Spiro-Tone if I remember correctly) and it was awful!  It created barrel-distortion and degraded the image far more than I had expected.  Well, they have come a long way in the decades since.This 2X extender is designed to work with both fixed-focal length telephoto lenses and long zooms.  I purchased this originally to use with my 100-400 zoom and even though the effective maximum aperture at 800mm was f/11 the resulting image was tack sharp.Recently I rented a Canon 400mm f/2.8 L lens and tried it with this converter.  Wow!!!  It was incredible!  I had it mounted on a good sized Gitzo tripod and was able to photograph a small bird from a great distance and it still filled the frame.  The effective aperture was only f/5.6 which is what you would expect for a 800mm lens.  I hope to purchase a 300 or 400mm f/2.8 in the future and I am sure that I will be getting even more use out of this excellent optical accessory.

$REVIEW.: I have tried quite a few IPad cases/ covers. From the Smart Cover from apple to various Bluetooth keyboard incorporated types from brookstone or zag etc. They have all been okay but haven't lasted very long. But this one i like.I have high hopes that this Logitech case will be around for a while. It fits very snugly into the case part. There is no way the iPad will slip out. All the ipad buttons work like they are supposed to while in the case and all charger cables fit very well through the appropriate slot. The Bluetooth keyboard was very easy to pair and charge before use. When the keyboard is closed or folded backwards while not in use the Bluetooth turns off to save batteries which I think us a very nice feature. I also like that there are no keys to fall out like there is in the zag keyboard. There is just raised "keys " on the case which work really well. Even with a light touch.This case has a cloth like feel and is pretty thick and protective. I like the cloth but it took me quite a while to get used to the color. Sunflower yellow is outside of my usual color comfort zone but I have to say its really growing on me. There is never any doubt which iPad is mine.

The screen spray is the secret, and it allows you to squeegee out bubbles and make sure the sheet is positioned exactly where you want it.The surface is crystal clear.  I used to be a big fan of the glare free types, even though they look a little &#34;foggy&#34;, but after this, I will never buy another brand of screen protector for any my devices.One thing though -- if you have a precision stylus with a disc on the end, like the Adonit Jot Pro, it will drag a little on this surface.  it's almost rubbery, but that is what creates it's self-healing properties.  Little dings that appear today, will completely disappear in a day or two all on their own, as the material springs back to its original configuration.To me, this is not enough of a problem to want to remove the shield.  I have multiple other stylus' and they all work perfectly.

If you are taking the camera to anywhere this may be an issue you should clean your camera afterwords anyways so dirt getting in their shouldn't be a problem. It will help some against dropping it or hitting it against something. It also helps to give you some piece of mind when using it. It is not a lifeproof or otterbox case that you have for your samsung phone or iPhone. It is a cheaper case so keep that in mind with what you put it through.

$review_text.: This was detected by Windows XP as an "Optiarc CDRW DVD CRX890A USB Device".  I used it as a boot device for my HP 2530p EliteBook and for some reason, there was an almost 2 minute delay where the drive's light showed no activity until it finally started booting the computer.  I initially thought it was not going to boot and changed some BIOS settings but then found out I was not waiting long enough.  The second USB cable providing power does not seem to be required if just reading the disk.===========================Update - 10/6/12: This worked on a MacBook4,1 (early 2008 white) to boot an Ubuntu 12.04 Live CD and also a Windows 7 install DVD, neither of which would boot in the internal optical drive.===========================Update - 10/28/12: This also worked well on the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display installing software from a DVD on OS X Mountain Lion.

$review_text.: It is a little more of a satchel or whatever, than just a camera bag.  I just love it.  There is a nice spot to put the camera and another lens in the padded pouch.  Next to it, is plenty of room to put my 80-200mm f2.8 (nikon), which i usually keep in its own case anyway.  There are four small pockets, roughly 6x6 in size. They are bog on the inside too, since the bag isnt stiff. Perfect for cleaning items (leans cleaner, spray, Giottos Rocket), in another pocket i keep my spare battery and remote control.  That leaves me two more pockets yet for other small items, circular polarizer, etc.  Then there are two separate "slots" such that would be used for a laptop, and the other a notebook or few.  You can keep pens and such in the other pockets easily too.  I This is my favorite bag, but havnt done much with it yet, other than load it, but it is a good size for carrying around whatever you need nicely.I got mine on ebay for less than half the suggested retail, including shipping.  I would buy it all over again.Tony

$REVIEW.: It's a basic 5 button wheel mouse, The shape is good and the material it's coated with provide a good grip


 It's lighter in weight than its beloved Logitech predecessor-that can be a pro or a con depending on your personal preference


I bought it because it's almost silent


 There is a barely audible click but it's way below the threshold of annoyance to others sharing the room, the tactile click feedback is similar to my other mice


 Even when there is too much background noise to hear the clicks I can easily feel them.


$SUMMARY.: Good mouse!

$REVIEW.: The Rebel XSi without it's battery grip, for me, is like holding an undersized light weight DSLR. It just does not feel good in the hands of a person who likes something more substantial.The Battery grip BG-E5 along with its new longer lasting battery system totally transforms this camera. It now feels comfortable, more substantial and more in tune with the other upper end cameras in canon's line up. This camera, is an ideal global travel camera along with the Canon G9, which I also own. They share the same SD card. The battery system is a different story however, but it is not inconvenient to take the two different battery chargers, as they are both light weight and very portable.I have battery grips for all my canon cameras and they make a huge contribution in enabling long reliable shooting sessions.This battery grip is not compatible with the former Rebel XTi but its grip houses the older batteries that are compatible with the G9. These two Rebels along with the G9 make for an affordable camera system that can give the user unlimited possibilities for creative photography.An appropriate wide angle lens on one body and a flexible telephoto lens on the other, will allow quick and easy coverage of every situation.If you are a Rebel XSi owner and are wanting a more substantial feel to the camera, then this is a must have item. I am very happy with the performance and the stream line appearance it gives to the XSi. The Battery grip BG-E5 is another first class canon product!
$review_summary.: Battery grip BG-E5 makes the Rebel XSi feel entirely different.

$review_text.: Love the software and features this TV offers but I feel that this TV offer a lot more if Samsung didn't deliberately lock down some of the features.  There is no reason Samsung should limit screen mirroring for non-Samsung mobile devices, this TV is fully capable of it.  I own a Nexus 7 2013 and Moto X, neither will allow me to mirror without the Allshare Cast application only available to Samsung devices.  Other TV manufacturers allow you to do this as long as your device allows screen mirroring (Miracast).  I find it disappointing that Samsung criticizes other companies for being a "walled garden" while they practice the exact same thing.  If they release a software update so I can mirror with non-Samsung devices I will give it 5 stars, to me, that feature makes the difference between an "okay" tv to an "awesome" tv.

$review_text.: My requirements were very complex if not outright strange


A brand new  Samsung Series 5 40" LCD on the wall
Other components - A three year old Philips HTIB unit and a Motorola Cable STB tucked away in a closet in the passage way along the living room (with the TV on the wall you wouldn't want to destroy the 'theme' by leaving other devices visible around it.


would you?)
In a setup like this, while the TV can do with IR, other components need RF!That was the simple part..

the Philips HTIB remote setup happens to be a little strange so with the simpler universal remotes, I had never been able to go beyond play, FF, FR..


even a simple power up was impossible to set up; let alone other capabilities like volume up on the rear speakers and others.To add to the strangeness, when I configured the power on/off macro on RF20, sometimes, either the cable or the HTIB would get left out (Philips HTIB and Motorola devices are best described as being sluggish and at times strangely unresponsive).Now this is how I solved all of the problems using this magical remote -1

Wired up RF for HTIB and STB2

Used the learn function for all the functions of the HTIB (and a few of the STB)


There is no dearth of keys as this device lets you extend the number of pages to 8 and even custom name each key on the LCD3
Within the TV mode (since it is the top most and most convenient to navigate to ) I renamed several keys and programmed power functions of each of the STB and HTIB
Now if any of these get left out, I have an option to individually control them

 This feature is described in detail in some of the other reviews of RF204

Even programmed some conveniences - For example in the TV mode if I hit the channel up key, the channel up of my STB gets invoked
If I hit the vol-up/down button, the corresponding volume control features of the HTIB get invokedIf you do not have any of the problem devices, probably a more simplistic universal could be a better choice but if you need some degree of customization, RF20 may not be the only choice but certainly one of the better and more economic ones.Also a word on battery life of RF20, as I didn't find it mentioned anywhere


Given that the LCD is active all the time and there is also this back light feature, it doesn't seem to be too bad
I have used this remote for about a month without any noticeable battery drain.

$review_text.: This is an update; Amazon was very good about dealing with this problem. After some discussion of what could be done, they shipped a replacement and that unit is working just fine.This unit was dead right out of the box. Plugged in and with no load a self-test shows dead battery, overload, and on battery. Normally those lights would be on just to test them, but in this case the voltage is very low and a load does not function when connected under test conditions. After a 12 hour time to charge, it does the same thing. Output voltage drops with a small load to 83 volts on self-test and the load stops working.

$REVIEW.: Used this on a stubborn code 446 problem that would have cost at least one limb for the dealer to track down.  Last time I took my truck in for a check "engine light" it cost $100+ for them to diagnose and replace a gas cap!  After having this scanner for the last couple months and doing a sequential parts check I was able to fix the problem with minimal expense.  Knowing what part is needed and shopping around cut the cost in half for the part.  Now I can smile when passing by the stealers place of business.  The unit so far has been able to do the diagnosis consistently and reset the CE light.  Only problem so far is I could not get the disk to download into the scanner but the codes in the scanner seem to be correct and current for my vehicle.  Not sure why there was a download problem but since I don't need to check any thing right now I am not in a hurry to figure out why it would not download.

$REVIEW.: The sound is good, but depending on the source, it is not always very loud. Sound on some channels of my TW Cable DVR (via my Sony TV over the supplied optical cable) is almost too low. There are occasional glitches in audio from the TV. More annoying is that the sub woofer cuts out for up to 5 seconds at a time. My BlackBerry Z10 phone and iMac connect to it as a sound output easily over Bluetooth. Music from these is much louder than from the Sony Bravia 55 inch LED TV. But the BT connect can cut out. If the volume is loud from the Mac or Z10, the sub woofer is on all the time. But if the volume is low, the subwoofer cuts out like it does with the TV. Any lulls in sound can cause the subwoofer to disconnect for 5 seconds. This is really annoying. I will try it for another 14 days, but right now I think this will be returning to Amazon.
$SUMMARY.: Sound quality varies based on source, wireless subwoofer is prone to disconnects. When it works, it sounds good, but it is flaky

My others would always get bumped/bent by my children as they stuck out of my laptop, this one I don't have to worry about.Formatted size is 29.7GB (expected) and so far I have not had problems with it.UPDATE:  I have been using this for a while now and I have to say it is rather slow.  I have had many different thumb drives and this thing is amazingly slow compared to any of them, even my old 4GB from YEARS ago that I still use.

It's not tinny and nice and clear.The bluetooth connectivity makes this a great option for streaming your music and for taking phone calls. Since it's wireless, you don't have to have your phone tethered to your speaker-your speaker doesn't even have to be on your desk. Even though it's a small footprint you might want to place it a little farther away (shelf, file cabinet, etc). Your voice will still be picked up.The controls give it a slick look but can be a little tricky if you don't place your hand just right.Overall it's a great bluetooth speaker and I would definitely recommend it.

$REVIEW.: I had to upgrade since I had an old Motorola cable modem and that the cable company has also upgraded their internet technology.  I did a lot of research of comparing and everything.  So I came to this conclusion and decided to buy it.  I gave it a try and it is giving out a pretty good performance so far.  No disconnections and no problems.  I'm hoping nothing goes wrong though.  I like the green, blue, and amber indicator lights.  It adds a different feel versus the single colored cable modems.  The design is decent and it's small so that it doesn't cause cluster on the desk.  I did speed tests and they were way faster than the old modem because it can hold 4 channels of downstream and 2 channels upstream.  Overall, I would recommend this modem as it is a good price to buy.
$review_summary.: This is a good cable modem so far.

$REVIEW.: The Sony  SRS-BTX300 Bluetooth Wireless Speaker system is a well built and designed product. It has all the features that you would want and the sound quality that beats many of the other wireless speaker systems hands down. The device is very solid, weighs a sturdy 5 lbs and has 2 speakers with a passive radiator for better bass/sound quality.It also is designed with NFC (Near Field Communications) for bluetooth pairing of devices. As is common with NFC some devices will pair easier with the unit than others, but I had no trouble getting any device to connect. There is also a line in jack and a USB connector to charge or power a phone, or other device. There are also the feature to switch from music to speaker phone and back again if need be.The design makes all the controls (power, line in, volume, ect) all easy to find and use. Also of note is the way the system looks, it is very pleasing to the eye as well as the ear. The device comes with an AC adapter that is made specifically for this device, which is a slight minus as it can not be charged by USB or any other way but the AC adapter, so don't lose it.The sound quality is good, the system is rated at 20 watts, but the specs provided say "Measurements: 10 watts minimum RMS power at 6 Ohm load from 150-10,000 Hz with a THD of no more than 10% (using AC power)". So really the fine print tells you that the device runs best with least amount of THD (total harmonic distortion) when using the AC adapter and if the speakers are set to 6 Ohms. Running it on a battery changes it to a DC power source and does not tell you what the actual ohm load on the speakers are or the THD with a DC power supply. In plain terms, Sony does not give you the specifics of what the true RMS voltage is with either power supply (AC or DC) and for a device of this price, that info should be readily available. So it says its a 20 watt unit, but that is not exactly true, because both ohm load and THD change when using either AC (cord) or DC (battery) power supply. However the sound is very good, just know that you get better performance from the device when it is running off the AC supply.All in all I think this is a really great unit. It is easy to set up, is attractive, the controls are simple to understand and use, and the battery life is very close to the 7-8 hour duration that it claims to be. This unit by far surpasses some of the other wireless systems I have seen and used.I can see myself using this well made product in a variety of locations, and have no doubts it will provide great sound reliably.Good product. Sony has made a quality device with the SRS-BTX300 Bluetooth Wireless Speaker system.

$review_text.: A great product from Sony


The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because my headphone jack broke after using it for barely 3 weeks
But it was covered under sony warranty and they fixed it for free
The graphics are really good I don't play much games on computer so dont really know how the games work


The back lit keyboard is really helpful when used in the dark


The battery only lasts about 6 hours even though sony claims 8 hours
Its pretty light and easy to travel around with

I recently noticed that the CD drive opens by itself after some time of use
I dont know if its something I do or the problem with the laptop
Its not really that big of a deal because I can just close it right away

To sum it all up its a good laptop for everyday use.

$REVIEW.: The Belkin Folio case is a nice looking slim-line case, which features a built in screen protector, easel, and soft velveteen interior

 It is made of a synthetic which appears water- resistant, though not water proof


 The texture on the exterior provides for a better grip, and some extra interest as a design feature.The case seems to be well made, though not terribly substantial


 This could be a plus or minus, depending on what you are looking for
If you want to maintain a very slim profile, this case will give you that

 It has a bit less protection than I generally like
That said, there is a trade off which comes with padding: not as slim a profile.Because I generally carry my tablet in my purse or another bag, I lean toward cases with more protection


My husband carries his and more like a book, and leans towards trimmer cases (like this one).The easel is sturdy but not substantial (i.e., will not hold as well as a kickstand)
 However, if you are in an environment where you do not have to worry about kids, or pets..

it will work well enough, and it is nice to be able to sit it on a desk or table(particularly for watching video).I'd say this is a 5 star case for people looking to travel as light as possible

 For those who are looking for more protection, i would give it a 3 or 4.As one with quite a few gadgets (all in cases) i personally prefer the cases I have gotten from Griffin technologies, but they are not available to fit every brand, every size (and I suspect many people would opt for a trimmer case).This is a nice case which packs a lot of features into a small profile,  great for those looking for a trim light case.It is less than ideal for those who want a bit of padding (particularly for such a large screen).

$REVIEW.: The genius of this tablet stand is in its simplicity. Made of plastic you'd find in your typical kitchen food storage box. But in the crucial places it has a material with more grip which adds to the functionality. As designed it really just holds your table at one angle. Of course you could do portrait or landscape at that one angle. I like to lay my tablet on top of the box and the grippy material holds it very well. This gives you another angle. Laying your tablet on top of the box, then opens up the original stand area to be used to hold your stylus. Nice. Another bonus is that you probably won't have to remove your tablet from its case to use the stand. Unless you have a  super thick, protective case, it should work just fine with your case. The storage lid as some have mentioned is hard to open. I found that if I apply four fingers to the clear plastic above the latch and pull up with my thumb it works just fine. I like the security of a latch that it won't just fly open at inopportune time. But if you want to make it easier to open, a fingernail file applied to the little plastic tabs would make it easier to open, just don't take off too much. I love the grippy material on top and the the little on the bottom makes for a very secure stand that won't easily slide around on the table. It could also easily be used in your car. Just don't be distracted while you're driving.

It has a real deep bass and sounds great even with a Bluetooth connection. I haven't had any problems at all and the connectivity is perfect. The features of this headset makes it very easy to operate with voice control as a truly hands free headset. Battery life will last at least all day and provides all day connectivity. It is not heavy at all and feel really comfortable around your neck. Its a bit expensive but honestly its worth buying it. I truly recommend this to anyone and trust me, you wont be disappointed.

It also opens and closes with just the right amount of pressure so that it stays closed but can be easily opened.However, when loading data onto it from my desktop, the flickering blue light which indicates it is active, is so extremely pale that on more than one occasion I thought it had stopped working when it hadn't.  I don't know if this is by design or whether I have a faulty one but it is the only reason for not giving it 5 stars.

$review_text.: Seems to be a good charger. If you look around here on Amazon, you will find at least 2 or 3 other chargers that (at least on the outside) are completely identical. I ordered this one because A) I've had good experiences with other Pwr+ products and B) it was cheaper than all the others by a few bucks. The other chargers may have different internals, I'm not really sure. I'm certainly not going to order one of them and open the two up, just to satisfy my curiosity. The other chargers all say &#34;This port is for Android, this port is universal, and this port is for Samsung&#34; and so on and so on. I was puzzled because this charger's ports aren't labelled in any way. I emailed their tech support about it, and they gave me the very simple answer that all 4 ports are completely identical. The only thing they said to me was that total output couldn't exceed 4 amps, and no port could provide more than 2 amps. So, you can plug 2 iPads in and charge at the full 2A rate for each, or you could (I guess) plug 4 iPads in and each would get 1 amp. I use mine to charge my iPhone 4 (work phone), my iPod Touch 5, my Galaxy S4 (personal phone), and my 2013 Nexus 7. It works like a champ and all my devices are fully charged in the morning, every time. My only complaints would be the blue power LED is very bright at night (but black electrical tape solved this nicely), and that if you listen closely there is a very faint but very high pitched whine coming from the charger when it has a few devices plugged into it. I'm not sure what that is about, or if there is any way to solve it (load balancing between the different ports, maybe?), but it's there. If you have really good hearing, it might be best to place this behind something or in a drawer at night so it doesn't keep you up. We use a white noise generator at night, which more or less covers this noise up.All that aside, this is now my &#34;daily driver&#34; as far as device chargers goes. Keep it up, Pwr+!

You could brew a 10 cup pot of coffee while this thing is loading a movie.  It takes so long, my TV starts searching other inputs for a signal.  This product would have been a 5 star rating if not for this annoying short-coming.If you have patience, this is a great product and the video and audio performance does out-weigh the disc load problem.

This means that not only the lens, but the barrel, your hand, and anything else within a two or three foot circle catches the mist. And the cloth is not very absorbent so you spend a lot of time rubbing and rubbing. And rubbing.

$REVIEW.: This device (Samsung Helix) is a great way to get Xm radio anywhere.  I have been traveling for work throughout the summer, and have been in roughly 10 different states, from the East Coast to the Midwest, all from my home base in California.  I have found only a few very rare places where I could not get a usable signal from the unit itself; when you plug in the extended antenna (included), you can get signal anywhere.  I drove trucks in various states and just slapped the antenna to the roof and I was good to go.  I loved being able to listen to virtually any style of music (my tastes run from rock to classical), with the addition of a number of comedy channels (best when you have a hard day and need something to cheer you up).  In the Los Angeles area and virtually any other large city, you can walk around with this unit and get clear signals virtually anywhere. The ability to instantly record something you like or have it tell you when something you like is playing on another channel is very cool.  The battery life is good for about five hours, which is not the best, but when you use a car charger it all works out.Do not buy the Samsung car charger, though. It costs about $75.  You can get a small inverter for your car power port that will cost you about $25 and do the same thing!Also, this Samsung unit is the exact twin of the Pioneer Inno, but costs tons less, for some reason.

$REVIEW.: This MP3 player is the best I have had so far.  I have had 3 iPods and a Zune, and they can not be compared to the amazing sound delivered by this new Sony MP3 player.  For those wanting a flash based player, this item is one of the smallest and more portable out there with an extremely bright and clear LCD display which allows for viewing videos on the go.  To make it even better, Sony did not go cheap, the player features a nice durable and well designed metal body, thats a bit taller than the new Nano Videos, not as wide and thick though.  Sony also includes a set of great ear buds, which are a lot better than those packed with any other player out there.I was tempted to go with the other Sony MP3 player,which has an FM tuner built in and is a bit smaller, but after comparing them, I think I rather have the one with the metal body, better sound and .2" bigger LCD.  Those of you that buy either of the new Sony's will be amazed by the performance of this well built device, and will love it a whole lot more than any other device that has been introduced into the market.I got the Nano Video a few weeks ago, that went on eBay already.  Compared to an iPod and iTunes, Sony has a nice user interface thats nicer than Apple's, you'll have no scroll wheel to deal with, you get better audio quality, a brighter LCD, and in my opinion a much nicer design.  You can use Windows Media, but I highly recommend using Napster (which comes with the player).  Napster is really close to the iTunes interface and will allow you to purchase albums and songs you like or you can pay $15 a month for unlimited downloads.  Those of you buying this MP3 player over the others on the market as of now will be making a great choice and will absolutely love this machine.

I've tried the bidding site units which are quite a bit cheaper in price but I've found the Sto-Fen fit and overall finish (it is just plastic, but there is a difference) to be better than the cheaper units. A lot of people make their own diffusers or don't mind using a cheaper unit however, I've found that you generally get what you pay for and although these things can't cost more than a few pennies to make, Sto-Fen at least makes sure the fit is good for each different flash, not too tight or too loose, and they make it easy for you to find the right one for yours.I need a powerful flash and in close quarters, it can be too bright. Yes, I do use bounce flash as well but the Sto-Fen diffuses the light in all directions so you get a softer direct flash and if bouncing, additional light off the ceiling or wall.  If you are looking for a way to fully light a dark room or area but don't want the harshness strong flashes can inflict, get one of these.

$REVIEW.: I have used quite a few can type studio headphones and have liked some more and some less

I received these Sony Red headphones and did not want to rush writing a review because all good headphones must be given at least 3-4hrs of use time to break them in and then you can judge how good they really are
At first I thought uh oh all I hear is lows and not much mids or highs

Comforting to say that after the break in period all the beautiful sounds have come to life
They are somewhat bass heavy similar to the Beat Pros but made way better than any Beat Pro has ever been


These headphones are very sturdy and WOW are the comfortable

They just conform to the ear and without any undue pressure so I can wear them for at least 2 hrs and not even think about them being on my ears.Ok now lets get to the sound


The bass is very clear and rock solid

The mids are there and are clean as well

The highs are good but wish maybe just a tad bit more

Thats just my preference though


The overall sound quality is way better than the Beats and as good but better bass than the Audio-Technica ATH-M50WH.I really like the detachable cable at the headphone end of the Sony headphones


The Audio-technica cannot be detached so kind of a pain to carry around with the bulky cord
Sony provided a very nice zip up carry case and fits very nice and snug to protect the headphones when not in use
If you care about boxing well it probably weighs as much as the headphones do
The box is super sturdy.The price is not the lowest for the Sony but compared to the Beat Pros that everyone just has to have these are hands down way better and less money too!! The build quality is very good high end
I will be using these from now on.

I drive them with a 4 channel 320 watt marine amplifier with a pair of Clarion 3 1/2 inch speakers up front at the helm. Rounding things off are two 10 inch subs on a second dedicated marine amplifier. When all is tuned up, the system ROCKS!These speakers definitely hold their own and compliment my set up nicely. The mid range sound is loud, crisp and clear with no discernible distortion. Highs are not as crisp as I would like but with the combination I have they are a perfect fit. I am so impressed with their sound quality, that I am considering mounting a pair inside my cuddy cabin.Finally, the quality is definitely on par with some of the more expensive brands and I can say that mine get wet quite a bit when I wash the boat down and still perform well after 8 months of use. A nice looking quality product at a fair price is what you get with these speakers.Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: I first bought a Netgear DM111PSP and the set up was a nightmare if you have a wireless router. Fortunately a reviewer at Best Buy had figured out the procedure. Once up and operating it began cutting out, making internet unavailable for 1-2 minutes every few hours. I finally got tired of it and bought this modem. Not only is it fully plug-and-play with my wireless router, it never cuts out, at least for the month that I have owned it. Very happy so far.

$review_text.: This is part of a three way Comparison, Bose SoundDock vs. Griffin Amplifi vs. Altec Lansing IM600. Please see my reviews for those other products for detailed comparison:Design and Features:Griffin Amplifi: Cabinet made of wood, looks like small shoebox. Has two 2.75" drivers front mounted and a bottom mounted 5" woofer with a bass port. Griffin in the worst Bose tradition refuses to disclose many tech statistics on their unit, but my power estimate puts this at about 30-40 watts, not really much different from the Bose SoundDock. (To sound twice as loud needs a 10 times (1000%) increase in wattage, so the Bose advantage of maybe 33% more power should not really give much real world benefit.) Frequency response per mfgr is 50-16,000 kHz which seems a bit unbelievable on the low end, but feasible enough on the higher end. Ipod docks on top and sticks awkwardly out of the unit like a control tower, but fit is snugger than on Sound Dock which makes me feel more reassured.There is a line-in and not much more. Big blue-lit knob controls on-off and volume. Remote is a copy of the Bose's with the same simple functions. Range and aiming tolerance is inferior to both the Bose and the Altec, but certainly adequate. Annoyingly, the Amplifi only charges an Ipod docked in it when the Amplifi is on; if the Ipod is docked and the Griffin is turned off, no charging. Either Griffin's engineers are idiots, or they decided to save a few pennies in the design.Sound:Griffin: Bass is about as good as the SoundDock, maybe lower extension, but roughly the same precision and balance. Griffin is to be commended for not going crazy and letting the big 5" woofer run roughshod over the sound of the Amplifi. The big woofer does not make the Amplifi sound better than the Bose at the low end, but on the other hand it doesn't sound worse, and it is also much cheaper. Griffin was not aiming to beat the Bose here, but rather to equal it with a lower price and simpler design. Mid-range is another strong point here, and treble is also a bit lacking, like in the Bose, but not too much so. Classical pieces still sound very good on the Griffin.Where the Amplifi does lose ground to Bose is in the fancy stuff. Stereo separation is non-existent, and detail is nowhere near as precise as on the Bose. This sounds like a big loud mono speaker. Low volumes especially lose a lot of fine subtlety, and distortion is heard at the very highest volumes (though to be fair, no one would really play this unit that loud, as it is probably 100 dB or more.) The acoustically tuned all wood cabinet adds little to the sound signature of the Amplif vis a vis the plastic cabinet of the Bose. The lack of stereo separation, detail, and full clarity throughout all volume ranges is where the added cost of the Bose is most evident and justifiable. Most users will like the Griffin though; it mimics the sound signature of the Bose convincingly, has a retro wood cabinet design, and has at least one important feature that the Bose lacks, a line-in, all of this at a street value of 1/3rd of what the Bose goes for. This will make the Amplif a great solution for most users, especially those on a budget. However, the added price of the Bose does create a noticeably superior sound in at least some aspects.Value:Griffin: List of $150, normally seen online at roughly $115-$125. I picked mine up at Circuit City for $100.Summary:Bose: Probably not worth $300, the price I paid of $225 feels like about what the SoundDock is worth. The sound is audibly better quality here, though probably not two to three times better than the Griffin or the Altec, which is what the pricing would indicate. The lack of a decent feature set makes the Bose seem like even less of a value. Again though, if style, quality, simplicity, and excellent sound is your goal, and price does not matter that much, the Bose is a fine choice. Special note to all the Bose haters: take a listen to this before lumping it in with such atrocities as the Acoustimass and StereoEverywhere technology. The SoundDock sounds unusually good, does not mangle realism of the sound unpleasantly, and is really the cutting edge of what can be done with reproducing Ipod sound from a small one-piece unit.Griffin: Aims for the SoundDock's sound signature, and generally succeeds. Lacks a bit of polish in both physical and sonic characteristics, but overall is an excellent value. If you want Bose, but can't afford it, the Amplifi will not leave you with many regrets. The wooden cabinet and big bass driver are not utilized very distinctively, but there are no glaring missteps here either. However, if you can afford the SoundDock, the Griffin has no real advantages as its clone philosophy and minimal feature set offer no advantage over Bose except cost. The bigger and better sound of the SoundDock justifies the added cost as long as price is not the main consideration.Altec Lansing: The excellent design, wonderful feature set, and portability of this unit distinguishes and separates it from the other two. Sound is generally well done, crisp and appealing, and the treble emphasis gives the Altec its own sonic niche. The power difference in watts is not really noticeable except if you are trying to fill up a big room with sound, and why would you be doing that with a wee tiny Ipod dock anyway? Most users will be very happy with the IM600's sound and the quality FM tuner is just the icing on the cake. If you are on a budget, I would say get the Altec as it sells for roughly the same price as the Amplifi, and has many more features including portability. The IM600 has somewhat less bass than the Griffin, but better stereo sound and detail clarity.
$review_summary.: Impressive Bose impersonator for a much lower price

$review_text.: When hubby was at work, I would often turn on a computer radio program to listen to while I did housework. Unfortunately, he was seriously injured at work almost 2 years ago. His sleep is erractic and pain makes the only place sleep is possible, is his recliner. Since I never know when he will be able to sleep, I stopped listening to the programs I had enjoyed, so it wouldn't bother him. My brother suggested I check out wireless headphones. He told me a very little bit, but mostly look for the kind that were wireless and not line of sigth, in other words the kind that could go through walls, ceilings, etc. So, I started researching and reading. I thought I would just pick up a pair at Best Buy or even Walmart. Well, the ones they both carried didn't have great write ups nor were they any cheaper than these Sennheiser RS120's from Amazon's seller Electronic Expo. Obviously, cost is important with out current situation. I'd never heard of Sennheiser. Left to buy by brand, I would have bought something familiar like Sony, but I kept reading good things about Sennheiser on every site I checked. The price was as good or better than the brands I had heard before. So I did rely heavy on the comments of others - thanks to you who posted. I am not an audiophile or techie at all.So now you know why I bought them, on to the headphones and how they work. In one word - excellent! I love, love, love them! I put them on and listen to the computer radio programs as I do housework and they don't disturb hubby from sleeping. Finally, once again I can enjoy what I want, when I want. I have only had them a month or so but I use them almost everyday from 1-2 hours, to all day long because they are compfortable enough to wear for hours, if I choose. Yeah, the ears will get a little warm but really not bad at all since they are not cupped over them. What little sound may escape doesn't bother hubby as I am not setting beside him when I use them and I doubt they would do so even then, because I don't have anything that close to my ears blasting. I have worn them out to the garage to load my truck with some things, out to the end of the house to the garbage can and even down to the end of the driveway which is about 175' long. I never lost my signal. I did get white noise louder than my signal only once and that was when I pushed the garbage can over to the side of the drive and I was underneath a powerline transmitter - duh - no surprise there was some interference there. But, obviously it only lasted a the few seconds it took to leave the garbage can there and then as I stepped away, the signal was clear again. My house is a ranch house, 65' long. The computer and headphones transmitter are literally on one end of it in the dining room we use as an office. The entire house and full length basement recieve a signal just fine. When I walk through a doorway, I occasionally get a little hiss or white noise mixed into the voices, but only passing through the doorway. The rest of the time is perfect. Performance is A+ for me.To be honest, I have not hooked them up to the TV nor Stereo, but all of the plugs you need to do so are included. I can say that on the radio talk shows I listen to they do occasionally play music coming on, going off, commercial breaks etc, and it sounds great. So, I am sure listening to CD's would only be better.If there are any negatives it would be the inability to tighten them just a little more. Thanks to reviews by others I was aware of this before purchase, however, I wasn't intending to use them for exercise so it didn't matter. It still isn't a big issue. I am only 5'2" and have a pretty small head. Adjusted to the smallest size works well for almost every thing I do. If I am running the dust mop and bend over to pick up the cat's toy they are fine and don't move. Once I was bent over for a while as I was pulling out everything from the closet floor to clean in there and they slipped around. Not off, just off center of the ear. Had I not stopped and repositioned them, I suppose they could have fallen but it was not that big of a deal. I did find that a little of my hair had gotten between the headphones and my ear. If I make sure all my hair is pulled back before positioning the headphones on the ear they stay put better. I guess a cup style wouldn't matter but these do, so if you have long hair, make sure it is all out from between the headphones and ear.The only other thing I could say that it was lacking was better instructions. I may not be an audiophile but I figured out how to hook everything up simply by looking at it. I did learn things from posts however, I wouldn't have known otherwise. For instance, I received them, let them charge overnight and then when I tried them the sound quality was not good. There was a LOT of noise even close to the transmitter. From the review posts I had read, I was aware of the tuning button below the volume control which tuned in the signal. I didn't see anything in the packaging about that! Had I not known, I would have been dissappointed in the product. Knowing about it beforehand was great, I simply tuned in the signal and I was off to housework - happily once again.In conclusion, I cannot compare these to other wireless models, they are my first ones. But, I am VERY happy and for $59, I feel it was well worth my money. I would highly reccommend these to anyone.
$SUMMARY.: Housework soooo much easier!

$review_text.: This review is for the black version of the Anker 40W charger with Smart Ports

 This sleek devices easily charges pretty much everything I plug in to it: iPhone 5S, iPad 2, Blackberry Bold, TomTom GPS, Philips Bluetooth Speaker,  Kindle Keyboard, Kindle Fire, and my friends' various Android phones


 It's great not having to pay attention to which port you need to plug the device into: this charger will adapt each port to the device and charge it at full speed.The only issue I noticed is with my HP TouchPad: in WebOS mode, it will charge slowly, but when I boot it into Android it will show charging, then stop charging, over and over


 I won't hold this against Anker as the HP TouchPad is very finicky when using other chargers and I am running an unofficial operating system on the device.Overall, this is a great device for charging pretty much everything in your house that charges via USB
 It's small form factor also makes it ideal for traveling with various power-hungry devices


 Nice work, Anker!

$review_text.: I do not own this particular camera myself but if you are interested in portable digital point and shoot cameras, since Canon discontinued the Power Shot S-80, this one is one of THREE digital point and shoot cameras on the market that I know of that have a "true" WIDE ANGLE lens of 28mm! (The other is: The Canon Power Shot SD800 IS for [...]----and another one is Kodak EasyShare V570 which has a 23mm lens and sells for about [...])So, you ask, "who needs a 28mm lens?" You do! Most people concern themselves with how LONG is their telephoto lens. But, most people who "know" know that it is the WIDE ANGLE lens that is most important---most of the "best shots" are made with a WIDE ANGLE lens. For example, you're in Europe and you are trying to "get a shot" of that Cathedral of Notre Dame over there. You NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are in the California Poppy Fields and you want to get the expanse of the golden-yellow poppy flowers with the huge blue sky filled with white clouds above---you need a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are sitting at thanksgiving dinner and you want to take a photo from the foot of the table with everyone sitting on the left and right---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. You are in the garden of the California Mission and you want to take a photo of the ENTIRE garden surrounded by the mission walls---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. It's Christmas day and you want a photo of the ENTIRE GROUP of visitors in front of the Christmas Tree---you NEED a WIDE ANGLE lens. This is where the 28mm lens on THIS camera comes in! So, you NEED THIS CAMERA! Otherwise you'll be cutting off heads and leaving Aunt Sylvia out of the "Christmas Group Photo" this year---and she'll disinherit you and you'll live a life of poverty and misery everafter! :o) If you agree or disagree or know of ANY other digital point and shoot camera that has a WIDE ANGLE lens please write, Email:boland7214@aol.PS:  Followup----today I tried out the "big brother" to this camera, The Panasonic DMC FX07 which you can find online for about $250.  I REALLY liked the photos that camera made.  Some reviewers complained of "noise"---but I didn't see any with the photos I took.  If you want to see photos taken with the FX07, please send me a request via email.  Thanks.PS: I've lately become aware of a "better" camera, the Nikon P50.  If you wanna know why I like the P50 over this one write to my email address.

I went through the installation a few times and somehow the router was finally able to make a connection with the modem to connect to the internet.  I've had success adding other computers and my iPod to the network.  The range is good enough (at least in my 900 sq ft home) that I can walk around with my laptop and still have a connection.

$REVIEW.: Whenever you have a portable device that has an available 12V adapter, it's always a good idea to purchase one and use it on the road or water when you can plug into a 12V socket. You can turn up the screen brightness without using up the batteries. The Garmin eTrex Legend Cx has such amazing battery life, however, that I only have been using it on extended trips.

$review_text.: I now have this laptop, it is lightening fast and I highly recommend it. However, I had to purchase it again locally as my purchase through Amazon was a disaster.I bought this laptop from a seller linked to this page. The next day when I contacted the seller - because of a really lame lie he told - I fully understood at that time I had become the victim of fraud.However, because Amazon would not allow me to file a fraud claim until a full 26-27 days after the sale date, I did not get a timely refund, and I was forced to watch as the unscrupulous seller sold the same non-existant laptop repeatedly from this page.Now the seller's profile page has a long list of people reporting their own experiences of fraud. This weekend, almost 1 month after this purchase with Amazon, I am finally being allowed to file a fraud claim. Will Amazon delay reimbursement another few days while they attempt to contact the seller - this despite the long list of reviews (including mine) verifying that the seller is a scammer and has long since skipped? I certainly hope not, because doing that would indicate (I believe) Amazon is not capable of quickly assessing even the most obvious instances of fraud, but instead is pouring its energy into a slavish bureaucracy.The computer sales pages on Amazon have become so rife with scammer sellers that even me, a former entirely enthusiastic supporter of Amazon has to admit that this is no longer the place I had come to love.It is now not uncommon for me to find that after my order(s) won't go through the Amazon cart, I will later receive email invoices from the sellers (which look very much like the Amazon shopping cart) that tell me I need to pay by Western Union wire transfer to successfully complete the transactionI am discouraged. I no longer believe Amazon is a safe place to shop. I will add to this review in the coming days and describe my experience with the Amazon A-Z guarantee.As to the laptop, you will definitely be happy with it. The display is incredible, the processing power is considerable, and the graphics card is as good as you are going to find on an Apple.

$review_text.: First, I am a retired electronics/computer tech. I have setup many networks in my career. Based on past experience, I bought a ZyXel wireless router and The ZyXel WAP3205 to extend my wireless to the top floor of my home. The router setup in 10 minutes. For the life of me, I could not get the WAP3205 to connect using the ez setup. I called tech support and the 3rd tech I got was excellent! He could not get the combo to work either but rather than give up, he grabbed a router and WAP like mine and he had the same issue. He stuck with it until he found a work-around then called me back. We had to go to the expert setup and manually enter settings and it now works like a champ! Bottom line is great support located in California, not some 3rd world place with broken english.  Will be 5 stars when firmware is updated to fix the ez setup.

$REVIEW.: The power supply is really easy to install and the cabling is completely modular.In normal operation, it emits some random soft knocking noises (a bit like a mechanical disk head bumping into something, for comparison).Also, at random times, the fan is loudly kicking off and spinning up briefly like a car would do when the drive revs up the engine at idle.Finally, the fan spins at full speed on a cold start and upon computer wake, but not on computer restart, go figure...Since I bought this PSU mostly to get silent operation under low load, that doesn't work at all for me.

$REVIEW.: Please make sure to wait until this goes on sale...save yourself a LOT of money.  Okay, I bought this awhile ago, but in that time I've had a chance to do some research, so I thought I'd share with you just in case you want to get one of these for your home.  I will compare the moviemate 60 with the 72.The Moviemate 60 is a newer version of their popular moviemate units, but it isn't HD like the 72 is.  Here's the catch though, the picture on the 60 actually works BETTER in a bright room because the lumens (the measuring stick for how bright the image is) is at about 2000, and the 72 (which is older) is at 1200.  Here's how this affects you when you watch a movie:I played the same scene from Toy Story 2...it's a scene that takes place in a dark room, with Woody walking around and stuff all over the place.  I set up both the 72 and the 60 in my daughter's room, with sunlight flooding the wall I projected the image on.  The difference was remarkable.  The 72's image was almost completely washed out, but the 60's image was very visible.Also, the 60 is more compact, has a handle and a carrying case.  The 72 is HUGE (by comparison), has no case (well, Amazon sells one, but it's about [...]!), and has no handle.  Use-wise, both units are remarkable in their ease of set up and operation.  And the sound from both won't give you surround sound, but they work very well.So, if you plan to have the unit set up in pretty much one place, in a dark room, and you want HD, the 72 may be for you.  However, if you need portablility and want something you can show in even well lit rooms, the 60 is hands down the winner.p.s. I bought the 72 after I had the 60 for awhile, and this was the result of much hand-wringing and working to try and justify keeping both units...hehe!  But I did end up returning the 72.

$REVIEW.: I own the CX 300 and now I own the CX 400 and I must say I am very pleased.  The CX 400 is the new CX 300 in terms of sound quality and low price but you get more for the money with the CX 400's.  The sound quality of course is even better than the CX 400 with more accurate bass response.  But you get an awesome pouch, clip, and extension cable for almost the same price as a CX 300.  I was thinking of getting the CX 500 but I did not find the volume control very useful for my needs.  Overall this is a great product for the price I got mine $24.99 from J&R.

$REVIEW.: I've had this unit 18 months now, and it sees frequent use (one to two times per week).  I paid sixty bucks, and for the money, was an excellent find considering my requirements (see PROS below).PROS:- Light weight (good for travel)- Aluminum- Inexpensive (compare to hundred+ dollar models)- Ball Head - quickly adjust camera position- All the adjustments you'd expect to findCONS:- Light weight (moves in brisk wind)- Aluminum legs, with use, began to warp slightly, making it difficult to expand/retract them.  Although, this is more of a bother than physical limitation.- Not sure how much longer the plastic "snap" latches will last that fix each of the 9 leg segments into place (although, none have completely broken to-date).UPDATE:Two and a half years later, it's time for replacement.  The 'stage' that attaches to the ball head became loose, and further investigation shows that the cast metal threads failed.  I would suggest being very careful with heavy (or expensive) gear.  And, as is inevitable with any legs that secure via plastic clips, those too started failing and I'm left with tripod legs that have segments taped together.The inevitable bottom line:  we get what we pay for.  I feel that I've more than got my money out of this unit and didn't spend so much on it that I would be afraid to have lost it, or ran over it accidentally.  Just be weary.

It's been months, and it still has an odor... Not as bad but it gets in my hands. It was on my night stand and it woke me up with the stench...(it's the foam in the interior) ! My other whine is that it won't hold up the ipad when I am FaceTiming. It plops the ipad down, which is why I bought it. As a case though, it is sturdy and hold the ipad in the case very well.

$review_text.: This case goes above and beyond protection

This is perfect for people who drop things sometimes or if you like taking your IPAD out with you.Pros:1
Comes with a screen protector so you don't need to buy one.2

It has rubber covers for every hole (audio out, the mic, the silence button, camera etc...)3


I dropped it on concrete and nothing happens to it4


Ive pored water on it (by accident) and still nothing happened.5


Has a nice stand so you can watch movies on it without having to hold itCons:1
Very bulky/heavy

There really isn't a way around this because of the amount of protection on it
But it does add about twice the weight to it and larger with it on.2


The covers for the holes wont stay open if I need them to be

Example, when I use Facetime, the mic cover won't stay open and neither will the speaker
There is a spot that you push them in, but they won't stay


This causes the sound/mic to be less effective

This could be fixed by adding a better holder for the covers


This also causes problems if you ever try to use the camera in the back as well.Great product for those who travel
Not really the ideal case for just home use.

$review_text.: These players have one feature that's really, really hard to find in dual-players - they will pick up where you left off, even if the power is removed (as with a home DVD or Blu-ray player, you just need to hit &#34;stop&#34; once before turning it off). They're very easy to use, especially in that they don't require a remote. If you're buying these for kids, that's important because those can go missing pretty easily. Another nice feature is that you can set either one to be the &#34;master&#34; unit if you want to watch the same DVD on both screens. On some other dual-players, only one can be the master.That said, they aren't perfect. My first beef is with the screen resolution - it's only 640x220 rather than full 640x480. It's not a big deal, as the screens are good quality, but display technology has advanced to the point where a 640x480 screen should be cheap enough to include in what is their top-of-the-line model. Second, it would be nice if they had a battery so that they keep playing while the car is off. That's a minor issue, though, and it's probably not worth what it would cost to add a battery.The main competition for this unit is probably the Sylvania SDVD9805, which I also own. Its screen resolution is better, one screen accepts cards and USB sticks, and it has a battery, but the resume feature and master-master ability make the PD9016 a much more usable unit overall.
$SUMMARY.: Great, full-featured set of players; a few areas where it could be improved, though.

$review_text.: Great router!The good:*  Easy set-up

 Took about 15 minutes from un-boxing to plugging it in to getting on the internet using the wireless connection


 And that includes walking downstairs to install it.*  It works:  Streams high-definition video to my television and blu-ray player through a wired (ethernet) connection without any buffering or delay issues.*  Wireless works great


 Easily connected my Mac laptop and my iPad to the wireless network by typing in the (provided) password.*  Allows for customization from basic (plug it in and get on the internet) to more advanced (such as ReadySHARE Cloud access)*  The NETGEAR Genie tool is very useful and seems to be fairly user-friendly (for a router, anyway), although I have not used the tool very much yet.*  Setting up a password-protected wireless connection was a breeze


 I connected the router to the internet, plugged it in, waited a few minutes, turned on my laptop, and typed in the password (which is on a label on the bottom of the router)
 Worked like a charm.The not so good:*  The NETGEAR Genie tool is not fully-functional on a Mac on anything under OS 10.6


 I am running OS 10.5.8 and the tool allows the use of most functions, but not all

 So far, this has not caused any problem at all
 The part of the tool that does not work on OS 10.5.8 is not necessary to operate the basic functions (password setting, etc.) of the router.*  Registering the router with Netgear was a bit glitchy and took a few tries
 For some reason the "next" button on their website didn't want to work

 But, after a few tries, it did.Very happy with my purchase!  This router is used for running:  Two laptop Macs wirelessly (OS 10.5.8, Samsung blu-ray player wired, Samsung UN46D6400 television wired, two iPads, HP wireless printer

$review_text.: I've owned this for a few months now and can say that I wish I didn't.  This looked different enough to pique my interest, and the reviews seemed on par with others in the same price range.  First and foremost was the sound quality.  A majority of the music I listen to was clipping out at the higher ranges.  This was with turning the volume down on my phone (HTC HD7 if it matters), and adjusting the volume with the LG.  I've tried pairing it with a PC and listening to music through there and got the same result.  Just in case, I tried it with a friend's Galaxy S phone, and also got the same lack of quality on higher frequencies.  About all I've found it bearable for is spoken word podcasts.Calls are clear but I've had some people say that it sounded like I was speaking to them on a speakerphone.  Though, some have said I sounded crystal clear.At first, the wrap-around the neck styling was comfortable.  I've had them on for hours and didn't experience any discomfort.  The problem is that it gets lost in my collar, and I can never find the controls quick enough to answer a call, or pause music.  Also, turning my head quickly will often pull the earplug out of my ear.  The plugs also get pulled when I'm removing it from my backpack.  Even though it the wires are short, they do get tangled and caught on things, making me wish I went entirely wireless.It does hold a decent charge, around what they say ~ 10 hours.PROS-Ease of use-More comfortable than other BT headsetsCONS-Sound quality at higher frequencies-Easy to pop out of ears-Wires get caughtIt isn't so bad that I will be replacing it with another set.  It is still usable for calls and listening to podcasts, and my phone will speak text messages and allow me to speak replies entirely hands-free, so I'll hang on to it for that reason.  I may opt to upgrade my car's stereo with one that is Bluetooth enabled so it makes up for the sound quality, at least in the car.

$REVIEW.: USB hubs are becoming popular as they provide extra ports to desktop and laptops with a limited amount of USB ports. The kdLinks Super Speed USB 3.0 5Gbps 4 Ports Hub is a great way to suit the needs of users with these issues.Inside the box is the hub, an AC adapter, a USB 3.0 cable, and the user manual. The packaging for the device was very nice. The hub came in a box which was just a little bigger than the hub. My initial thought when I opened the hub is that this is a great device for larger USBs, such as novelty flash drives, or SD card readers.The entire AC adapter cord is 45 inches long. The gauge of the wire is thick for an AC adapter, which is great for normal wear and tear. The AC adapter itself is 3 x 2 x 1 inches, and blocks neighboring outlets. I wish a power cord would be ran to my surge protector instead of a huge AC adapter, but this was probably made to cut costs.The USB hub has a matt black finish, with a glossy top where the logo, power, and USB indicators are. The hub is rather compact at 4.3 x 2.8 x 1 inches, which is great for travel or use at home. As said earlier, the top has a blue LED to indicate power and each of the four USB ports. The front has three horizontal USB ports about a half an inch apart, which is great for larger USB devices. The left side has one USB port if the USB is too large from the front. The back has the USB 3.0 to PC port, a power switch, and the 12V port for the AC adapter. I like that this has a power switch in the back to turn off the hub if it isn&#8217;t in use. This is a great way to save power and keep energy costs down.Specifications:&#8226; Product Model: KDLINKS UH4-P&#8226; Product Name: KDLINKS USB3.0 Super Speed HUB&#8226; Interface: USB 3.0&#8226; Material: Plastic&#8226; Color: Black&#8226; Input Interface: USB 3.0 B type male*1 and 12V/2A DC*1&#8226; Output Interface: USB3.0 A type female*4&#8226; Weight: 105g&#8226; Support system: Windows XP/Vista 7/8 & MAC (Support USB)&#8226; Safety approval: CE&FCC;&#8226; LED indicator: LED power indicator- blueLED1-LED4 Corresponds USB1-USB4 indicator status-blue&#8226; Input of power adapter: 100-240V 50/60Hz 0.5A&#8226; Output of power adapter: 1V/2AWhen I plugged the hub into my USB 3.0 port the hub automatically was detected and detected all devices attached to it without the need of drivers. I then tested this USB drive with myWD 1TB WD Elements Portable USB 3.0 Hard Drive Storageusing a program called CrystalDiskMark. On average I get a read and write of 81 MB/s. The device received the following results:Read: 81.73 MB/sWrite: 81.20 MB/sThe results matched the average read and write benchmarks. I am satisfied by the results of this hub.Overall, this hub is great for larger devices that need extra room. The build quality of the hub is great, and requires no drivers. Because of this, I rate this product 5 stars.Pros:+ Great build quality. Half inch in between USBs, which is great for larger USB devices.+ Switch in back to turn off hub to save power and money.+ Plug and play, no need for drivers.+ Portable and great build quality.+ Durable AC adapter cordCons:- AC brick attached to outlet, which blocks neighboring outlets.I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest and thorough review.

$review_text.: I'm a fan of Lowepro products. I have almost 30 different products, from pocket camera size bags, to back packs, belts, vest, lens cases and so on. I look like a freaking Lowepro billboard when shooting. I purchased this to stick my Fuji XF1 - when shooting, I carry my big Canon DSLR's, but also a compact camera. If I'm out exploring or someplace where a DSLR is just too large, securely attaching a compact camera to my belt is a huge plus - I hate sticking it in a pocket.This belt loop is fantastic. I've used compact camera bags with a little Velcro flap holding it in place.  Works great until it doesn't - like hiking above some ruins and it decides to come loose. Then it's climbing over a railing, down a crumbling wall, and grabbing a stick to retrieve the camera from a cluster of bushes near a ledge. So I needed a replacement - I no longer trusted that bag.  This one is is similar to the Lowepro professional bags. There's an extra large section of heavy duty Velcro to hold the reinforced belt flap in place. Then there's a loop with a heavy duty snap to double-secure it in place. It's the belt and suspenders theory. No way this thing is coming loose.The case has a micro fiber padded lining and a wrap-around zipper. The main compartment opens wide for quick access. The XF1 is the largest camera I'd put in this case - it's 4 1/4" long, 2 1/5" tall and 1 1/4 thick at the lens. The side against the zipper is 7/8" thick - any thicker and the zipper would not close. This case is slightly smaller than the Case Logic SZ, but much more robust.Additional features: Two small loops for attaching a small neck strap, extra large zipper pulls (can even use when wearing heavy gloves), and an external accessory pocket with a Velcro flap and a small divider. The divider will hold a couple of memory cards. The pocket wold hold a few AA batteries.If you need a heavy duty small camera bag that will take abuse, slips on and off your belt when you want - and stays in place even during a jog or on the ski hill, this is it!  Mentioning the ski hill - I use the external pocket to hold a heat pack (glove warmer size) - this keeps the camera warm, thus extending the battery life about 200% on freezing days!
$SUMMARY.: Great belt loop, excellent quality - tons of features. Love it on the ski hill.

$REVIEW.: I used this with an iPhone 5 and I honestly regret the purchase and returned the unit.  While the sound quality is excellent for the hands-free and stereo, the functionality leaves a lot to be desired.It's like there are two CPU's inside, the main one that handles the phone, Pandora, and radio.  And the second CPU that handles apps, including Pandora (yes, two Pandoras).  There are constant pop-ups warning you of driving while watching video.  Like the pop-ups aren't distracting.  Furthermore, the pop-ups prevent you from using the stereo, except for the radio function.  And god forbid you try to use an app while listening to music, you can't.  Everything stops when you use an app.

$REVIEW.: I tried them in all orders and combinations and these work just fine.The electric contacts allow you to use autofocus but I end up working in MF anyway as AF tends to hunt a lot when on extender tubes. On the other hand, these contacts also allow you to set your aperture using your camera controls.The usual issue is that modern DSLR keep the lens wide open to have a bright viewfinder, and only set the lens to the actual aperture when shooting the picture or when the user presses the depth-of-field button (under the lens mount on Canon cameras, on the left on all but the 5D-III).If ever the contacts do not work, you can still set the aperture you want by attaching your lens directly to the camera, setting the aperture with Av or M modes, enforcing it on the lens by holding the depth-of-field button and while holding the button down, remove the lens. You can then mount it on the camera over the extension tubes. This is a somewhat painful process and prone to accidental aperture resets either mounting the lens or if the contacts work intermittently.In any case I didn't have to resort to this method (yet) and I am pretty happy with the result.I tried these with a 24-105 L IS USM and a 70-200 L IS USM. No problem.Addition on 2013 09 29: my best lens to use with it: theCanon EF 50mm f/1.8 II. This inexpensive plastic lens keeps on startling me: it is clear as the day, works extremely well in IR (no hotspot whatsoever) and when paired with these extension tubes allows me to shoot electronic boars as if they were cities. At about $100 this is really a lens to consider.

This thing does NOT work for repairing discs if the scratch is near the outside of the disc. I've tried to repair a disc several times and the scratch is still there each and every time. If the scratch is more towards the center it will be repaired.

$review_text.: I wound up returning these due to the poor sound issues.Headphones arrive on time, in great shape and packaged well from Amazon and August.  They have a nice coating to them which did not attract finger prints.  The padding is great!  Soft and the whole unit fits comfy on your head.  The controls are subtle, accessible and functional.  The battery life was great.  I used it for several hours a day for almost a week before I charged it.But...There are two big cons.1)  The sound.  My normal headphones are a pair of Sennheiser PX200s.  These things are awesome!  I knew I would be down grading in the sound department, but I need/wanted a wireless headphone at work.  I just move around too much.  Anyway, the problem with these is the sound.  There is almost no treble. The base and deeper tones just drown everything out.  I tried adjusting the equalizer on my player and while it made a difference, it did not produce a good sound.  I tried to turn up the treble all the way and the bass all the way down.  There was little sound coming through the headphones and it was awful.  It did not matter if it was wireless or wired.  Same sound.  This is why I returned them.2)  The only design flaw I found, and I would not have returned them for it, was not having a battery power level monitor on the headset.  I never new how many more hours I had left.

Very pleased so far.Well, it is long past the summer and, as promised, an update is required.I have used these batteries in the 7D and the 5D Mark 11 for well over a half a year now and have recharged them about 6 or 7 times. They continue to provide excellent power supply for extended shoots when used in the battery grips. I have not calculated accurately the number of frames taken for each of the batteries but they appear to function very similarly to the canon brand for longevity and reliability.I am highly recommending these batteries and I would most certainly purchase Wasabi products again.

Enough to bounce almost any size light and make it soft and unobtrusive for the viewer.  Enough to fit in most regular size rooms.  And certainly big enough so that you can use it to stand under when it;s raining as I have once!It folds up easily into a very small unit and can fit in any size car.  This also has the options of being used as a diffuser and gives you options for gold and silver.  Although some of ephoto's products are cheaply made and don't last, this is something they got right.  It's a great value and is worthy of being in any photography or videographer's tool kit as you just need a really large flex-fill sometimes!

$REVIEW.: Just got the new Airport Extreme "n" version

We were replacing a really old Airport Base Station we've had in the home office since 2001.First here is a list of items that connect wirelessly throughout our home:iBook 500mz, w/standard Airport cardiMac Core 2 Duo 24", w/Airport Extreme cardNintendo WiiTivo, Series 2Tivo, Series 2 Humax DVDHP Officejet 7410The switchover went fairly smoothly - plugged in the Airport Extreme, switch the Ethernet cables from the Linksys Router (we has DSL coming in), then went about configuring it


Only took a couple of minutes


Then went to the Macs and selected new network, and was was connected!The Wii was the same, very easy to just select the new network.The Tivo caused a bit of a problem, both connected via Linksys WUSB11 Wireless-B USB Network Adapter, and even though I set up the AE to be B & G compatible, Tivo would not accept it


In the end I purch 2 Tivo "G" Network Adapters ($100 for both) and then configured Tivo.Here is a rundown of assumed speed increases, please note no benchmark testing was performed-this is just my perceptions!iBook-nada, same as beforeiMac-faster (finally the Airport Exteme card could take advantage of "G" networkWii-no idea! Don't know internal specsTivo-Big increase in transfering programs between Tivos-actually makes it worthwhile, and a general increase in getting updates etc.The negative of course, is we are not taking advantage of the "n" network because no one supports it!! We gained because we went from "B" to "G"
I will probably rant went we need to replace all the network adapters and airport cards when the hardware becomes available for "n".One final benefit we will be using, is the option to add a NAS USB Hard Drive (AirDisk), we are looking at the NewerTech miniStack, as it has the same footprint and will hopefully stack below the AE.

$review_text.: After Apple released the free "take 2" update for the Apple TV (applies to all models), the box became quite a bit more useful


 I would now not hesitate to recommend it to people with flat panel TV's looking for a great way to watch Podcasts, TV Shows, Movies, and YouTube

 The built in movie rentals are great - they literally start playing about 30 seconds after renting and are great quality (even the non-HD ones)

 I also enjoy instant streaming of any podcast available on the iTunes store - I find myself using the Apple TV instead of watching regular cable TV

 However, why can't you rent TV shows yet?  The only way to get TV shows is to BUY them for $2 each, whereas you can rent an entire movie for only $3.As a music hub, the product also shines - I can have all my music permanently hooked up to my stereo, and by using an aux input on the stereo, I don't even have to have the TV on to listen to music


 This new version also allows you to stream *and control* the Apple TV from any other Mac (or PC?) via iTunes, so you can stream music wirelessly to your living room

 The old version could kind of do this too, but you had to set it up via the Apple TV which required turning on your TV set
 Now, I can just turn on my stereo and start streaming while I'm sitting at my computer.YouTube is also fun, and as a photo sharing box, the Apple TV really shines
 Photos synced from iPhoto, Aperture, or just a folder on your computer look stunning

 Built in Flickr and .Mac support is also nice, although the Flickr option only shows public albums which is kind of disappointing.

$REVIEW.: I loved the features that this mouse had to offer.  Came in a nice package with instructions on how to pair.  Word to the wise:  set this up as a mouse first, then as a speaker.  You'll have to set it up as both if you want to use both features.  The mouse feels a bit big in my hands, but I am a female with slightly small hands, but it is comfortable.  The speaker is not the highest quality, but, honestly, I didn't really buy the mouse for the speaker quality.  I wanted something that was bluetooth so that I didn't have to take up one of my USB ports with a dongle.  This works perfectly with the Bluetooth, glides well, and the buttons are all easy to use.  There's even volume butts on the side as well.  The battery life is lengthy, and charges quickly.  Overall, for this price, it was exactly what I needed for my laptop when I didn't want to use the trackpad.
$SUMMARY.: Great item for the price, love all of the features!

$REVIEW.: Not too bad for the price
Only one level for the prop though, which can be frustrating
But you can always use the strap as the second level to prop on

The plastic microfiber backing seems to be pretty strong stuff, and the front cover (not real leather) is pretty good too.

$REVIEW.: Probably the best compromise in terms of Performance vs Price.This card is fast enough for the full buffer to be used in my 40D (no slowdowns due to the card when using continuous mode @ 6.5fps).  Does everything in-camera that I could hope for.  Sure, a faster card might upload to the PC faster, but to me, the extra minute or two isn't critical, and definitely not worth the inflated premium price of those other cards.

$REVIEW.: I had a small cordless "blower" we use in place of "canned air" for cleaning
The AC charger for it died


It would have cost a fortune to just replace the charger, as it was an "odd" 16V unit

This unit was inexpensive and fit the bill


The higher voltage settings for this unit were perfect and the tips supplied had one that worked fine

I was able to recharge that blower unit, and anticipate that this charger will be more useful in the future.

$REVIEW.: After so many years, my original cable stopped syncing, but works only as a charger


 This cable was reasonably priced and the reviews convinced me to give it a try

 And I am glad I did, because my Zune is able to sync again and I love the little caps that come with it! This cable seems better built than the original cable, its longer and the end that connects to the Zune has no buttons, (which is how the original one broke!!!)You can go the cheaper route too, but this cable was worth the price (for a few dollars more, but still cheaper than the OEM price) and I expect many more years out of the Zune.

$REVIEW.: Since I received a pair of these as a sample for review before the app was ready, I was not able to take advantage of The customizing app. The app will actually scan your personal library, then make a recommendation of which earphones to purchase. You can then use the recommendation to order the color of headband and earphones and have them customized to your music and your style.This particular earphone, the Genesis, is actually likely the set which would have been chosen if it had been available. They are designed to be light (something important to me) and are aimed at the user of lower quality sound sources. (Yep, that is me). I have been using them on music that I imported from CDs through my computer, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and other basic sources. The quality is well done, and I appreciate that they do bring out the best in this kind of music.While listening to them, I can hear some background, but it is diminished, and the padding on the ears seems to hold the sound in. While not as spectacular as my favorite earbuds, for over the ear, they do very well.Since I have a small head, I was concerned about fit, but was pleasantly surprised, since they actually move down to a level smaller than I needed. They rest comfortably on my ears and head, and look nice at the same time.(Note - this contains both a single prong and double prong connection)

$REVIEW.: Its been about 6 months with this baby and I have yet to see any issue
I wanted to give this baby a try because of the speed and potential of the product
My one concern was longevity of this hard drive
So far it is amazing and no issues
Hell I dont even think that I have had to reset it since the installation

Good speed, good quality = happy nerd.***Update***Its been about a year now and it is starting to fail already


I have recently noticed weak signal throughout my apartment and that is new

I have also noticed my signal drop a few times while streaming or downloading, this is most noticeable while watching vudu or netflix


In the past most of my routers(netgear, Linksys, dlink) have last about two years before giving out and that was with heavy gaming, video streaming, and downloading


I will give a further update later on


Although I imagine I will be replacing this router in the next couple of months and doubt I will go with WD next


I do trust the WD name but they are new to routing
They are still one of my favorite choices for hard drives.

 However, the scroll wheel is the  most glaring example of poor design and assembly I've seen in Logitech products


 The wheel is very notchy and requires way to much effort to use, also the way in which the driver scrolls pages is inferior (lots of jitters and unresponsive) to my Microsoft optical mouse and my Razer Boomslang mouse

 I think I'll be returning this one.

$review_text.: Nothing about this product worked as described. When plugging in my iPhone 5, I was very worried about the plug damaging the phone, as it moved more freely than I felt comfortable with. When plugged in, the arm could not hold up the phone well. It constantly sagged in one direction or the other - making it absolutely useless.When the phone was correctly connected to the product and the product was plugged into the lighter outlet, the phone did not charge. This was my biggest selling point, the fact that it would charge while I used it for the GPS, therefore this was the biggest disappointment.Why make this product AUX capable at all? It just made for another cord to be draped across my console. Radio frequency would have worked just fine.

$review_text.: I use it to connect my home keyboard/mouse, home monitor to my work laptop at my home office, while also keeping my home desktop computer plugged in. This makes it much easier to switch between the two without having to unplug the monitor VGA cord and wireless mouse/kb USB.I used to also have to hit the input switch button on my monitor everytime the screen on my laptop went blank.This was anytime i got one of those Administrator messages, or anytime it went through the log-in or restart process. Very annoying.This product is extremely functional, seems well built, but I give it a 1 star hit for the delay when switching. It's minimum, but it does take several seconds for the Mouse/keyboard to &#34;register&#34;. I know that isn't a whole lot of time, but at the same time, it would be perfect if it were more seamless 8) (meaning I would give it 5 stars).Overall, I would say 4.5 for sure, and worth every penny to me for my situation with frequent switches.

$review_text.: I have a pretty long history with Sony cameras

In addition to the "litter" of point and shoot models I've purchased from Sony and used in both Europe and the US, I've also long experience with the venerable DSC-R1, the SLT-a33, and the F707/F717/F828 series (which may or may not be described as "point and shoots," depending on your perspective)

I would have to say that I very much enjoyed the a33, and under the right conditions, that camera (the a33) can knock out some truly terrific images

The a33/a55 had a few deficiencies, as all cameras do, but if you learned to work around them, it wasn't much of an issue.Now, if you are an owner of either an a33 or an a55, you are probably reading this review to help determine if the upgrade to the a57 is "worth" it

If you are new to the Sony line, you are probably comparing this model to some of the Nikons or Canons (I've some experience with these, as well, having owned the Nikon D7000 and the Nikon D5100)

I can tell you that I would be able to recommend the Sony SLT-a57 for either category of users, and although what I write here has probably already been commented on by everyone else already, it still is helpful to hear another person's impressions of the camera.What is it that makes this SLT-a57 so nice? Here's some of my reasons:1
Highly responsive - nearly instantaneous autofocus, quick power on, and no delays in the menu system2


Lightweight - it's a tad heavier than the a33, but not much; this is still one of the lightest DSLR's you'll run across3

Gorgeous flippable screen - high resolution, and can rotate through two axes of motion4

Good image quality - it can hold its own against the other brands (there are some caveats, as always, and your lens model has a large impact on this)5
Very comfortable grip - improved from the a33/a55 (which is on the small size) in both shape and the tactile surface6


Loads of advanced features - multi-shot layering, HDR, special effects, and, of course, aperture mode, shutter mode, manual mode, etc., etc.7


Extremely reasonable price - even when not on sale, it's a great price, particularly when you pick it up with the highly reviewed 18-135 lens as part of the bundle8

Long battery life - the battery type, though still in the "M" series, has more charge capability than the older "M" batteries used in the a33/a559


Excellent video capability - can take video in high resolution in both "i" and "p" modes, as well as either AVCHD or MP4 formats10
Built-in help system if you are new to DSLRs, and want some advice for shooting with certain modes/conditions11
Generally good physical layout of buttons12

Super high burst rate of 12 frames per second (faster than most any camera in this class, and perhaps equalled only by some extremely expensive models13


Electronic "spirit" level can be displayed on screen to verify horizon (every DSLR should have this!)14
A number of Zeiss lenses are available for the alpha mount (includingSony SAL-85F14Z 85mm f1.4 Carl Zeiss Planar T Coated Telephoto Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera,Sony 24 -70mm f/2.8 Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Cameras, andSony SAL-1680Z 16-80mm f/3.5-4.5 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T DT Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera)I have paired this camera with the very nice 16-80mm lens, but I have also been using the very inexpensive Sony 35mm F1.8 lens, and the images have been exceptionally good

Based on the reviews I've read, you should get very good results if you purchase this with the 18-135 lens, which is apparently made in Japan, and is being offered at a fantastic price when you purchase it with the a57
Overall image quality from the camera is therefore seen as very good (with the exception that the jpg rendering engine for the a57 is not as good as some other brands, sometimes resulting in minor image artifacts under some conditions), and images are generally sharp and contrasty (you'll need to post-process to maximize sharpness, but this is true of nearly every camera).The camera is exceptionally responsive
Due to the speed of the unit, you can focus on your photography, and not wait for the camera to catch up with you


If you prefer to use the viewfinder, the electronic viewfinder on this unit is improved from the a33/a55, and most people say that it is very adequate for a camera in this price range
I usually compose and shoot using the LCD display, and because there is no mirror to flip down and back, you get instantaneous focus and shooting

They say this is an entry-level DSLR, and I suppose it is, but that doesn't mean you can't take images like a pro with this camera


You just have to take time to learn how to use the various functions, and you can really knock off some terrific shots with this.Are there any shortcomings with the camera? Well, yes, but none of them seem to generally be deal breakers
Some of these might include:- Sony alpha lens lineup does not have the same range as, say, Nikon or Canon (however, there really are plenty of alpha lenses available from Sony, Sigma, and Tamron, and more to come from Sony in 2013, if the latest rumor is to believed)- Batteries are expensive (but they are for all cameras when you buy brand (which I recommend for this camera)- JPG rendering engine really could use some improvement (but if you are really concerned about this, you can shoot in RAW mode)- No "flash off" setting for P/A/S/M modes (flash will pop up, but if you push it down, it will stay down from this point...)- No custom leather case (yet) from Sony (but I suspect this may only be a matter of time)This really is a great deal all around, and as I write this in late 2012, there is a sale going on that has brought the price down quite substantially, making it even a better bargain

This is an easy five star recommendation, even when at retail price.Recommended Accessories:I very much like theSony STP-GB1AM Genuine Leather Grip Belt -Black, and use it all the timeA fantastic filter is theSony Alpha VF67CPAM Circular Polarizing Filter (Black), which is coated with the Zeiss T* coatingA second (and possibly third) battery is always important

I recommend the authentic Sony batterySony NPFM500H Li-Ion Rechargeable Battery Pack for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Cameras - Retail PackagingLens 1:Sony SAL-1680Z 16-80mm f/3.5-4.5 Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T DT Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera- a great zoom lens that opens very wideLens 2:Sony Alpha SAL35F18 A-mount Wide Angle Lens (Black)- amazing clarity for its price, and very lightweight, tooLens 3:Sony SAL30M28 30mm f/2.8 Lens for Alpha Digital SLR Cameras- a great starter lens if you want to experiment with macro photography

$REVIEW.: I agree with the previous reviews: it's an average still camera but a really sweet video camera
Its main plus is its small size (about the size of 70-80 stacked playing cards), which is also its primary disadvantage


The buttons are tiny, the viewfinder is tiny, but the camera is tiny and the video looks great
It's too heavy to be a shirt pocket camera but it feels solid except for its plastic battery cover door


For a case, consider a Pelican 1010


The camera and strap just fit in the case which is waterproof and crushproof

I carry it hiking as a video camera and emergency still camera.Start off with at least two batteries.

Trying to watch Netflix, Amazon Instant etc. on the second floor was next to impossible, and never good enough to watch in HD.The install was very simple and only took a few minutes.*Note that the PC that you load the software on must communicate wirelessly with the router, not wired.*I placed the extender into an outlet on the first floor about in the middle of the house.I now have excellent signal strength on all of our second floor devices, and am now able to watch the Roku in HD without it constantly pausing and shutting down.I have only been using the device for about a week and a half so far, but it has not given me any trouble. I will update after a longer period.** UPDATE **I've been using the device for almost six weeks now and it seems to be doing it's thing without any issues.

$REVIEW.: I got this drive for the sole purpose to transfer files between my mac and PC


It came preformatted in FAT32 which is the optimal format for my aging Mac and PC

 I'm not worried about things like transfer speed because for $5 bucks I'm happy with the quality and functionality

 It feels sturdy like it won't fall apart when you drop it or sit on it or something of that nature


 It also is a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be
 The whole case is the width of the metal sleeve that plugs into the USB port and about an inch and a half long, so be careful not to push it too far in or you may damage your computer's USB port


 I like how you could attach it to a key ring or lanyard but I personally don't like the opening being exposed to everything from lack of any kind of cover


 That's the only draw back I can find, but since I can't take a 1/2 star off I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

$review_text.: Quick review... been using laptops for 20 years.  Second samsung laptop.  It is late February 2013 and had the laptop for about 2 months. Overall, disappointed.  Form factor is terrific, but the tablet is very buggy... keyboard not working, screen dimming without cause, software updates failing... I've had to call Samsung support a handful of times -- they are nice, but not knowledgeable, and unable to resolve issues.

$review_text.: I bought this product for my ever hot HP dv6 notebook.  It certainly reduces the temperature of the hard disk and decreases  running time of the notebook's internal cooling fan. It is fairly quiet compared to similar products I have used in the past.  The ability to place the fan exactly where the hot spot is is great.  My only complain is that when I use it on my lap, the base jabs on my thighs/legs compelling me to change its placement every now and then.  Otherwise a solid product and does what its supposed to do(used for more than a month)

$REVIEW.: I dumped my landline phone service to save money, but I still needed a home phone for 911 service. So I chose the MagicJack.Stability was a concern for me before my purchase, but the MagicJack has been rock solid reliable. For increased stability, I chose to use the Ethernet port to connect the MagicJack to my network. With this setup, I have never had an issue making or receiving a call. It just works.I opted for the extra fee to keep my existing phone number, and the additional 911 fee, so I will end up paying 36 USD per year for phone service going forward (if the fees do not change). That's less than I was paying per month for the landline.I love the voicemail-to-email feature, and the iOS app has actually been quite useful for answering the home phone while away.

$REVIEW.: I have read the negative reviews on this camera and I'm confused. The Lumix ZS3 is the best point and shoot I have ever owned (and I have owned about 6 of them). Now, mind you, I said "point and shoot". It is not going to perform like my Canon DSLR or even my Panasonic LX3, but as the saying goes, the best camera is the one you have with you. The ZS3 is very portable, takes crisp, clear pictures outdoors, and had great reach. When I'm using this camera, I'm not looking for complete manual control or taking Raw images. The sensor in this camera is point and shoot size, so you will get noise if you crank up the ISO too high. Indoor shots taken with the flash come out looking too overexposed and washed out like all onboard flash pictures. I only try to use the flash as an outdoor fill flash. I'm looking to purchase a second back up ZS3, because I would hate being without one. I have used mine for 2 years without any kind of mechanical failure and it still performs like new. These cameras are becoming harder to find, but if you have the opportunity to buy one, do it. It's a great camera.Update: I was able to buy a lightly used backup ZS3 and this one works as good as my original. Love it!
$review_summary.: Love this camera!

$REVIEW.: This case is brilliant!The keyboard:  The keyboard is nice and (re)movable to place as comfortable.  Surprisingly, the keyboard stays on the cover magnetically which concerned me initially but this thing is strong.  It doesn&#8217;t move and won&#8217;t fall off though it does slide a little but not enough to concern me.  The best thing about the keyboard is that it can be used with other Bluetooth devices as well.  I connected it to my laptop and my Samsung Galaxy S3 to test it out and it worked wonderfully.  The keys are smooth though there seems to be a little lag.  The Bluetooth connected quickly and easily.The cover:  The material is nice though not leather or anything.  It is slim considering it holds the iPad and keyboard.  The iPad can stay put on different angles though it sometimes slides a little.  For stability, I usually slide the keyboard right below where I want the screen to be so it can perch against the keyboard that magnetically attached to the case.  It keeps the iPad in place nicely and the magnetic clasp is nice.  It's a little on the heavy side so don't be surprised.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product.  My only gripe is (as a woman) I would prefer more color options.  Black is nice but kind of boring.  For the price, it&#8217;s definitely worth the trade-off.

$REVIEW.: Unless you are a shop dummy with a perfectly round head, this is a really bad product.As someone else mentioned, if you wear this like a headband, it tilts downwards at the back of your head, so the camera ends up shooting the sky.  I bought several different mounts at the same time when I first bought my Contour, and never used this one after the first attempt.This issue could be fixed with just a simple change - to be able to adjust the angle the camera sits at, like you can on the goggle mount (Contour 2600 Goggle Strap Mount).Anyway..  THERE'S NO NEED TO BUY THIS ITEM..I ended up going to Target and buying a simple sports headband (~ $8).  That, plus the adjustable goggle mount work perfectly.Added bonus, if it is really hot, the headband also absorbs sweat..Hope that helps someone.

$review_text.: First and foremost, Amazon shipped fast, arrived undamaged, good job Amazon. The Western Digital My Net N900 with 1TB onboard storage seems like a dream come true, and it mostly is. Yes, you can throw your music and pics and videos on the storage and have easy access to them (which is the reason I snagged this version of the router). I read the earliest reviews about heating issues and I have not seen it yet (I believe a WD tech guy chimed in and said the fan was broken, which was great to see a rep from a company visit amazon and help out). The signal strength of the router seemed good ( I went outside on my patio and was able to connect my ipad, whereas on my old linksys and airport extreme's, it didn't). Its to bad this router doesnt have the 802.11ac (next gen). So there you have it, a great easy to setup router (Im pretty tech savvy so I skip manuals and setup software and just punch in the default IP of the router on firefox). I take off a star for futuresafe (no .ac) , and the potential of overheating (see prior reviews). I would def recommend this to everyone who is looking for an easy backup/stream solution.

$review_text.: I generally shy away from screen protectors, but the surface of my ASUS 300T has two relatively small scratches already and I'm a careful user. I wanted to get a protector on before I had any scratches in a very conspicuous location.Follow the installation instructions carefully!When installed, this shield is the most transparent and least noticeable I've seen on a device. From a tactile perspective, there's a little more friction than just the plain exposed glass, but it's still a good feel. I'm interested to see over time if it becomes smoother, as that's been my experience with ZAGG shields (or maybe I've just gotten used to them).A few notes from my install experience:I found the lint-free cloth provided to be anything but. During my first placement, there were a couple tiny black dust points that came from the cloth.  I used a toothpick very carefully and lightly to loosen them up poke them away. You can also try your fingernail. If you have another reliable lint-free cloth, I would suggest using it instead.Use the spray solution liberally, but make sure you have enough for the whole install! I actually almost ran out, since I had to make a few adjustments. Just keep calm and remember, if you keep your hands and the protector moist, you can recover from mistakes.If you're not particularly sure- handed, you might want an extra set of hands to keep the protector from folding/curling into itself. It's a lot bigger (obviously) than a phone protector and it can be a little unwieldy. Just make sure your partner also washes hands and uses the moistening solution.Like a few other reviewers, I have some tiny bubbles and dust points trapped under, but they are in the bezel area and do not concern me. The screen protector fits edge to edge, so be very precise with your placement! Do follow the suggestion to wait 12-24 hours before using your device. I noticed the protector was just slightly moving still after a few minutes being placed. Because it's such a snug fit, you wouldn't want to ruin it by thumbing your device around before it's secured itself to the screen.
$SUMMARY.: Most transparent protector I've seen, careful with install

$review_text.: Santa brought these for my kids for Christmas. They are relatively inexpensive players and I figured that Santa would not be too upset if they were lost or ruined by the wear and tear of younger kids, but so far they have been bomb proof. You can adjust the settings so that younger kids cannot blow out their eardrums. They accept miniature flash memory cards so you can up the capacity considerably. Your windows computer recognizes them as just another drive, so you can drag and drop content onto them if you wish, but also, Windows Media Player recognizes them too and you can use Media Player to manage your music with ease.

$REVIEW.: Excellent product


Replaced a simple Rosewill RNX-N600UBE dual band adapter


Increased signal strength and signal quality


Uses a Ralink chip set
It doesn't have as good of a signal strength as my Alfa AWUS036H adapter that uses a Realtek chip set
I've always preferred Ralink over Realtek because for some reason my computer hates Realtek


That's why I don't use my Alfa and used the Rosewill instead
But I am very satisfied so far with this Etekcity adapter
It installed no problem through Windows 7 automatically without the disk.I would highly recommend and would definitely purchase another if I had another computer.One thing I noticed, the plastic protector on the antennas comes off easily


No problem though, just exposes the bare copper antenna wire, coil and all

But easily refitted


Simple glue would keep it from coming off again


But its not like it falls off on its own.

$review_text.: I'd only recommend these drives if you find them at a really good sale price, and if you are technically inclined enough to do your own troubleshooting. The included backup software isn't worth spending extra money for. Bought two drives on sale about three weeks ago. Both appear to be working okay now but had some problems with drives not being properly recognized at first. Also had problems with system crashing when I followed instructions to first turn off the drive's power button, but now seems to work okay as long as I first use Windows XP's "Safely Remove Hardware" icon at the bottom of the screen. The included Retrospect backup software also has drawback of creating one huge proprietary format backup file which can create problems if you need to transfer or restore onto a new or replacement system that doesn't have same backup software installed - kind of defeats the whole purpose of having external backup drives. I just copied all the files first using Windows Explorer, then used free version of SyncBack to let me do comparisons and incremental backup with a normal file system.

$review_text.: The Logitech Squeezebox Touch is a fantastic music streaming solution for those who can set it up properly.  I understand that it isn't as easy to set up as a toaster or simple AM/FM radio, and perhaps Logitech was fielding a lot of support calls from buyers who couldn't comprehend how to set this up properly.  But after trying a few wireless streaming devices, I am sure that there isn't a better or more capable wireless streaming device available.The one bad thing about this product is that eventually Logitech will kill off its server, meaning that some of the Squeezebox services will go away - but at minimum I will still be using my Touch (and a pair of Squeezebox Boom units) to stream my home music collection for years to come.Just looking at the escalating prices of new and used Squeezebox Touch units - $875 new and $500 used!  (As of February 2013)  It looks like there was a thriving market for this product before Logitech killed it.  What a waste.  If you are still able to get your hands on one for a decent price I'd strongly suggest you do so.Note that I feel forced to remove one star from this product because eventually the server will go away, and perhaps sooner accessories and repair service will become difficult to find.  But as a product itself the Squeezebox Touch is top-notch.

It doesn't just fly off at any provocation, however -- you can let go to take pictures, etc.  Just don't wave the camera around a lot.Bouncers do a lot to diffuse the flash and reduce harsh shadows and overbright highlights.

$REVIEW.: *(Please rate this review if you find it helpful)*First off, you can't really mess up a HDMI cable; it either works or it doesn't. I'm not going to get into the argument that Monster cables are the same as every other cable (just google &#34;CNET why hdmi cables are all the same&#34; if you want to know why)This is not the first cable I've bought. I've purchased about 5 of these abs they're simply amazing! They're equally as good as a high priced hdmi cable. If you want proof, google why hdmi cables don't matter on cnet and they have a compelling article about how and hdmi cable, regardless of supposed features, are all the same quality. There is no reason to buy a monster cable or any of that crap.Now onto the product, first of all the packaging is very simple. Just a cord in a bag. While this isn't the most aesthetically appealing, it lowers production cost thus making it cheaper for you and me. There cord is thick which makes it feel sturdy and able to hold up over time.As for this cable, it is a RIDICULOUSLY low price for a great quality cable! Not only does this cable FEEL great, it LOOKS great too. It's one of those products that just makes the user feel like it's the perfect product to own. As an owner of a lot of these cables, they are one of the products that you just put a lot of trust in and it gives you ease of mind knowing that you have a great quality cable. I have since replaced all HDMI cables with these in my house.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

$REVIEW.: I tried applying the 3M natural View Screen Protector to my Kindle Fire while sitting at my desk.  I took my cat downstairs to the basement to eliminate distractions and then I washed my hands.  I cleaned the glass surface of the Kindle Fire using the same cleaner and cloth that I use on my own glasses.  When I was satisfied that the Kindle screen was clean and smudge free, I took out the 3M cleaning cloth and went over the screen again.  There were tiny little speck of lint on the screen that I hadn't noticed before which the 3M cloth didn't attract, but rather moved the lint around the surface of the Kindle's screen as I dusted.  It took a minute or two to remove any tell-tale signs of lint from the screen.  I followed the manufacturers directions on unsing the tab to peel back the film layer.  I immediately noticed that a few small specks of lint started to adhere to the sticky surface of the 3M shield.  Keep in mind, I was working on a clean desk in a closed room away from pets.  I started to apply the shield to the glass surface of the Kindle and noticed bubbles forming which isn't unusual.  I found that the cardboard applicator that came with the product was too wide and too flexible to remove any of the bubbles - the applicator reached past the raised edhes of the Kindle, which made it ineffective for smoothing out the bubble in the screen protector.  When I tried repositioning the 3M screen shield, I noticed that there was even more lint on the sticky side of the shield which I definitely didn't want permanently affixed to my Kindle screen.  In the end, I decided not to use the product.  It didn't meet my expectations.  I used a similar product in the past on an IPOD and didn't have problems like this.  The 3M screen protector is a fairly rigid piece of plastic which makes it easy to position, but hard to apply while trying to remove the bubbles.  It might have worked better had 3M included a hard plastic applicator instead of the cardboard one provided.  The 3M cleaning cloth was not very effective.  Overall I was not satisfied with the quality of this product.

$review_text.: I've had three Viking Compact Flash cards now that I've used with two cameras: a Canon Digital Elph S330 and Powershot G5

 Although people have reported seemingly higher-than-average failures and errors with Viking's cards, neither of my 128MB cards or the 512MB I have for my Powershot have ever had a problem.However, Viking doesn't exactly make the fastest cards on the market; higher resolution camera users will find the limited (1.5 Mb/s) transfer rate way too slow unless their cameras have a fairly large buffer; users needing exceptional speed may be advised to purchase a Sandisk Ultra II card (or better)
 Still, Viking's cards are an exceptional value for the price.


$SUMMARY.: Not a bad card for the price

$review_text.: Very nice price only $199 for such functionality/quality of pictures. Optical zoom 5x more than standard 3x. Nice built-in functionality of editting pictures. The scene choosing and guide for making photos are really helpful when you don't want to think how to adjust the settings to make the best picture in the certain conditions. A cool surprising feature is that camera can be in mode when it records 4 secs of audio just after the picture was taken. So later you can view the photo and listen what was going around. Seems a bit weird, but I like it. :) All-weather design is also good. Super-macro mode as close as 3cm/1.1inch was also making me happy.Other than that some major cons I've experienced - impossible to change the zoom level after the camera starts to record a movie, no viewfinder, you can't set the flash to the slow mode manually (it automatically sets to this mode when you choose night portrait scene as I've understood), dual-image stabilization sound really impressive, but I'm not using it very often.But obviously there are more pros than cons. I would recommend this camera. Especially for a such price :)

$REVIEW.: Take a nearly ten year old home built PC, that's been collecting dust, pop in this video card and BAM! I'm gaming with the big boys again


 Plays all my favorite games at max settings 1080p


 (Tested with Borderlands 2, Saints Row 4, Payday 2 ect...) Love all the ports on the back, I'm able to use it on my desktop, but also keep a connection going to the living room (for playing movies) and with a flick of a button switch the picture to the living room.I'm only running a dual core AMD Phenom but with this card and an SSD drive my PC has new life pumped into it.

$review_text.: The data transfer rates I've been getting with this card have been fantastic.Using a Transcend USB3.0 card reader:via USB 2.0: 15-20 mb/svia USB 3.0: 30-45 mb/s depending on file sizesI've been taking lots of video footage of surfing that result in 4gb files, and taking tons of pictures of the family over the summer.  The faster transfer rates are extremely helpful as a result.One oddity I've observed:I transferred a 350mb video file the other day, which should take almost 8 seconds at 45 mb/s.  It transferred virtually instantly, showing up immediately in the destination folder, and without the windows file transfer dialog popping up.When I tested large (4gb) files and folders, the transfer speed spiked at the beginning, and tapered off to ~45mb/s by the end of the transfer.  I'm uncertain as to the cause, but in my experience small video files and small batches of photos transfer faster.

$REVIEW.: I have been an IPOD addict for about 5 years.  I have a 120gb IPOD classic which is flawless and I have a 120 GB ZUNE which is also flawless.  But when my 30gb IPOD 5.5 Gen died when I left it in my truck overnight accidently in (-40) weather, I decided to go with this 4gb Zune as I didn't want to take my more expencive mp3 machines (IPOD/Zune 120) to work.  When I first connected it my computer windows couldn't find it and it wouldn't turn on (no charge), after leaving it hooked to my laptop for about an hour it sprang to life when I touched the play button.  The laptop finds it all good and I upgrade the firmware.  After I finish loading my songs (I filled the player's 4gb easily) I listened to it and all was good.  The next day when I go to work I plug it in to my truck via Aux cable and it dies it about 5 mins....what gives??  The battery life in this Zune 4gb models needs to be fixed, my 120 gb Zune lasts for days on and off with over 12000 songs on it, same with the 120 GB IPOD classic, but this one seems to lose it's charge within minuites.  I am going to try and hook the USB charge/Sync cable into my truck adapter like I did with the old IPOD before it froze to death and hopefully that will be ok. If I have to leave it on charge is no big deal because this is strictly for my work truck and I can leave it plugged in.  Even so, people buying this should go with IPOD nano, IPOD classic, Touch, or Zune 80/120gb machine, way better battary life.So in a nutshell, this machine is great, great sync software/games, awesome controls, etc. just don't expect it to stay charged very long.
$review_summary.: Great, bad battery life.

$review_text.: Looks great!! The IPS technology makes a huge difference! I mistakenly got the non ips version first and couldn't stand it, even sitting right in front of that one, the sides looked a tint of yellow. But not with this one. Spend an extra $20 for IPS, it has more benefits than just looking at the screen from an angle and the colors are very rich, btw great for gaming and great response time. No ghosting and minimal light bleed.

$review_text.: I had high hopes for this unit, but it really disappointed.In my particular area it was unable to find major chain stores, and other places that have existed for over 15 years.It could not find a major hwy (hwy 70 -which was formed in 1926), which runs through the middle of town.It all has to do with too few points of interest (POI's).This 1200 unit only has 1.3 million.I used a family member's magellan 1212 which has 6 million POI's and it was excellent for finding places in my area.Bought mine online from dell and requested an RMA the day after I tried/tested it.It would be nice if there were some way to "test drive" a set of POI's online; to see if they will be sufficient for your area
[example: comparing 1.3 million against 6 million and see if POI's in your locale can be located.][maybe there is a place online for doing this testing; a website(s) that I just am not aware of].As far as this 1200 unit goes, they should switch to a "section" of the USA, like southwest, northwest, etc; offering POI's maps for those most often traveled areas.I could/would use one of the southwest only,(TX,NM,AZ,CA) rather than their current"stripped down national" map.

$SUMMARY.: Get a GPS with at least 6 million POI's. 1.3 million is too few.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this Vizio router through one of the sale-a-day websites for well under the new price listed here as of the beginning of 2013. But it replaced a Linksys router which had worked great until it started dropping connections. As has been restated many times already here, this router all but installs itself. It also has a decent Help section available for nearly all settings, even the so-called advanced ones.It does as well or better than any previous wireless router we've had in terms of distance transmission - a computer in our most remote part of the house suffers little from the distance. I had forgotten that it had the USB port until I decided to submit this review. Given that this unit likely supplies little if any power to the port, I intend to try using it with an independently-powered 3.5in USB hard drive. But the USB was never a part of my purchase decision.The aesthestics of this unit require mention, since even my wife, who abhors all visible electronics finds it far more appealing to the eye than the antennae batboxes which we've had before.If you want a twin band unit and haven't much money to buy one I'd definitely give this one a shot rather than settle for a single band unit.
$SUMMARY.: This Vizio Router exceeded my expectations...

$REVIEW.: I bought this insert to toe around my Olympus XZ-1 camera and accessories during a recent family trip. I already had a bag to carry my personal stuff around, and I wanted to use that bag.  This insert fit in there perfectly (you will need to measure your existing bag to ensure it fits), and it even helped square the bottom of the bag so that it would stand up without falling over.As it was intended, it protected my gear on many roller coaster rides, etc., and it was easy to deal with.  The top comes off the bag, if  your own bag already has a flap, decreasing the time required to get to your gear. I recommend this product if you already have a bag you like and want something to cart camera gear in it.  Will not fit a DSLR, but it also was able to fit my Olympus OM-D when I was in a bind, although it is really too small for the OM-D with the 12-50 mm lens.

$review_text.: Due to the glowing reviews, I had thought that these were going to have amazing sound


 Well, their sound was comparable to the Skullcandy JIBS earbuds, which pretty much means they were okay
 Not the best I've heard, but not the worst either
 However, my main issue with the Panasonic's are that their longevity leaves a lot to be desired


 They only lasted me three months, which is pretty much the same as the Skullcandy's and less than the Sennheiser's CX150 (which lasted me about 6 months)

 I say go for the Sennheiser's
 Superior sound and they last longer.

$REVIEW.: this cable design is excellent in that it is now reversible, but these cables are much more complex inside than the old 'dock connector' and with that there is a chip inside the connector that assigns pin function making it much more difficult for a generic to clone this cable. for the time being, I felt it worthwhile to pay the $19 to get apple Original cable that I know will last and work properly with my iOS devices moving forward.I recommend buying an apple Original cable like this one at least until the generics have had more time to proliferate and be tested long term.

 As a teacher, I liked the idea of a streaming box with a Chrome Browser to use for my display which is a large 1080p flat screen on the wall


 So, I purchased this unit during the Christmas sale, and I have been using it for almost six weeks

 This one will show webpages, images, videos, etc.--with none of any of the issues found in the other NeoTV


 Not to mention, it connects seamlessly with a usb keyboard, both wired and remote

 This is a solid player, again seeming to be able to connect with just about anything I throw at it in the form of a wireless network
 The &#34;My Media&#34; mp4 player is the best I have seen with modes for native, centered, stretched, and cropped--any of which can be selected on the fly
 For my purposes, I recommend it without hesitation!

$REVIEW.: I was excited when I saw this product. Finally I can switch the uses for my sound system remotely. The price compared to the non remote controlled boxes is pretty high but the convenience is worth it if it works.I needed this to be able to switch my audio from DVR, DVD and blue tooth device. I use to have a non remote one when I had a VHS. Since I only needed 2 for a while I just used a splitter between my cable (DVR) and DVD. I was really happy since i don have to get up to the box to switch  the audio to the system im using.Since I added a blue tooth reciever so I can use my surpund sound while listening to music with my phone without ising a wire, I needed more than just a splitter. I was also happy to realize that the splitter was affecting the quality of the sound.I have a bad back and was excited to see this product with a remote. Was hoping I don't have to get up everytime I have to switch what I'm using the sound system for. All I wanted was for the remote to work at 6 ft. Unfortunately it does not work unless the remote is a foot away from the unit. I read all the other reviews before I purchased this product and everyone I read stated how great it works with their remote. I didn't read all of them until now. Too late to find out that it works great if you have the Logitech harmony remote. The remote that comes with the unit is horrible.Well, if you're buying this unit to make your life easier being able to switch without having to get up, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE REMOTE 1 Ft away FOR THE REMOTE TO WORK. You might as well get the cheaper u its without the remote and press the switches yourself.

$REVIEW.: I received the unit today, after amazingly quick shipping.  Everything seemed to be fine.  I backed up the unit, deleted extra foreign voices I didn't need, then set about downloading the update that the TomTom software indicated. Now the device is communicating with me in Afrikaans (no, really), and the touch screen is frozen and unresponsive--even after repeated soft resets.  TomTom support offered to send me a replacement--in 7-10 business days.  Various forum posts on the TomTom site indicate this is not a unique problem, and that there may be a bad batch of these around. Some customers report receiving 2 or more defective replacement units. By the way, the full functionality of the 540's current replacement (Via 1535) is still not supported by TomTom. My suggestion:  don't take the chance.  I'm returning mine for refund.  Very annoyed.

$REVIEW.: I bought a new Acura MDX and was unwilling to pay the extra dollars for the GPS. So, I got this one. It's terrific. The screen is good sized and clear. Directions are very good. What surprises me is the quality of the voice recognition. I'd size it's close to the quality of the built in of my old Acura MDX, which was as good as I've seen. You can also use a USB cable and send directions to it from Google maps! It's not difficult to do. I don't know if I'll ever buy another built in, considering the pricing.

The screen does some Crazy flickering and then goes black.  Hard boot because you can EVER get it back any other way.  I played with it for about a month and they get into other projects.  This card was going to be the star of my video entertainment system in my rec room. HUGE FLOP.  Never got it to work after many hours of google search and driver updates.  I forgot what the original problem was, and made a mistake and put it in a Windows 2012 training server..... It conflicted with my Network card and killed it.  Now my DNS is toast and I can't refer to any of my computers except by ip address.  I HATE THIS PIECE OF S*HT!  In my 35 years of computer Tech experience, I have NEVER had a video card that was so completely useless and damaging to other components.  SHAME ON YOU GALAXY FOR RELEASING THIS GARBAGE!

I connected the Powerline 85 adapter to my FIOS router and Blue Ray, and after working with Sony's confusing instructions on registration, finally got Netflix up and streaming.  The Powerline kit really extended my wireless reach, although I wish it was a smaller device.  It occupies too much power outlet space, hence my 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: First off, I have a stills background with very little experience in video so I can't talk techno-geek when it comes to sound. I am just going to relate my experiences with it and what I have read about the microphone.This microphone does make recordings sound better than with the built in microphone on the GH1.  With that said, the difference is not night and day so you need to decide if it is worth the extra money and hassle of carrying this microphone around. After owning the mic I would say it is not worth it for home movies around the house and many other situations.  Some examples of where I do think it would be worthwhile are: 1) if you are recording your kids plays or recitals.  2) if you are a teacher recording students speeches.  3) Recording bird sounds while filming.  4)  Recording your kid playing sports and you want to record every swear word I mean grunt of victory.  Basically, anytime you have a specific intention to record the sound of something further than 20ft away.  If you do that often then this mic is probably worth it for you.From what I have read the GH1 cannot really do professional sound as it has auto gain built into it and this feature cannot be switched off.  The other thing that I have read is that professional sound recording is not done from a distance but from close up.  (In movies there are mics usually right overhead or maybe a small mic inside the clothes of the actors.)  I am not saying you can't shoot an award winning film with this mic I am just saying it is not the industry standard.As far as the mic goes it also has a huge design flaw as far as I am concerned.  The mic is not powered by the camera and has a separate battery (1 AAA) and switch.  It does have a battery indicator light but that light does not indicate when the mic is on or off.  it just blinks once when you switch the mic on.  What this means is that on a regular basis I either don't remember to switch the mic on or I forget to switch it off.  I will say that when you record video without it switched on you really get some nice sound free video.  No noise.  You do get a message on the camera when you switch it on with the mic attached reminding you to turn on the mic but that 1 time reminder is easily forgotten.The construction of this mic seems relatively sturdy and very light weight and portable.  So that is a plus.  The front of the mic has a shock absorber so it should be able to take some light weight hits and keep working.  Also, the plate that slides into the hot shoe is metal.  Finally, the microphone does pivot up and down for selective aiming.Overall, this mic is overpriced.  However, it does improve the sound quality from distant recordings.  I think there are specific instances where it would be worthwhile improvement over the built in mic but you are risking not getting any sound at all from a mic with either a dead batter or that is switched off.Pros:Better sound than built in micLight weightSmallRelatively well constructedCons:ExpensiveEasy to forget to switch on or off leading to the possibility of no sound recordedExpensive

$review_text.: Why I bought this:My Intel iMac just decided to died one day. I took it to see the Apple "Genius," he told me to F-over more than $1000 so they can do test and figure out what is wrong with it; I can have it back next week. I asked whether if Apple do data recovery and if my data will be deleted. They told me if I buy a new Mac, it will ONLY cost $100. Also, they told me the data will most likely (95% chance) be gone. So I packed my things, when home, and got on Amazon and bought this and Vantec CB-ISATAU2 SATA/IDE to USB 2.0 Adapter, just in case.Review:Structure: Case look really nice, you can clearly see the HDD and component inside. Good for heat dissipation. Two LED lights indicates Power and data processing. 1 USB port and 1 ac power in.Installation: Very easy. Lose eight screws, put Hard Drive in, tighten 8 screws.Actual Usage: Only supports USB2.0, takes a long time to transfer file. The AC is the single unit plug in type that blocks 2 sockets. It is about 5 feet long, a little too short for me.Bottom Line: It looks nice, works wonderful. I'd recommend it.FYI: Hard Drive taken directly from an iMac won't show up on Windows, additional software is required. I took my the whole day to recovery all my data.

$review_text.: The Klipsch KMC 3 excels with frighteningly loud sound, gobs of bass, and pristine clarity that sounds better than anything I've ever heard in my life.While Klipsch markets this speaker as the ultimate beach-party companion, the KMC 3 offers more than head-thumping bass at bewilderingly loud volumes
It also sounds very, very good.The sound is so clear that it will reintroduce you to your MP3 collection


The KMC 3 provides incredible distinction between the individual parts in the mix, and the sound of each element is so confident, strong, and clean
In tracks that I've listened to for years, I can pick out details I've never heard before


I can hang onto the wispiest arpeggio in the background strings and tell if there's one, two, or ten people singing tenor in a choral song


It's addictive.What's really amazing is that, after an hour of marathon listening to mellow, subtle tracks and some rock, I couldn't discern any artificial push in the treble, midrange, or bass.Now, there's abundant bass, so much bass! More than enough to "roll around in the music," especially when listening within twenty feet

But the basslines never sound thick or muddy, a common failing of "warm" speakers like UE

Instead the basslines are clean and clear as if the bassist was sitting here in the living room five feet away with his amp on the floor

The sound design is true and plain, almost..
acoustically "flat." I can't believe I'm going to say it, but--It sounds like a professional monitor


The most muscular, bassy, powerful, acoustically pleasing monitor in its price class.And by the way, it's portable, weighs the same as a laptop, I can carry it in one hand, and it can run on D-cell batteries.Volume
Let me address volume separately:Holy crap!At it's highest volume, it's so loud it scared the hell out of me


I only cranked it up once, and I'll probably never venture past two-thirds volume again

At full volume, the KMC 3 starts to eerily resemble a PA speaker


That's right, I said a PA speaker

This Bluetooth speaker could rock a house party or a backyard barbecue.I'd even go so far to say that the KMC 3 could serve as the primary soundbar in a home theater, 65-inch plasma and all
It's that loud.Competitors like the Jawbone Big Jambox, Sony SRS series, Bose Soundlink II, Beats Pill, Logitech UE Boombox, Sonos Airplay speakers, even the full ZVox soundbars just fail to hold a candle to this Klipsch.Now, most Bluetooth speakers in this size cost $200 or so, but even considering the price difference, the Klipsch still comes out far ahead


If it costs twice the price, it feels like four times the speaker.Give this one a try


You won't regret it.

$REVIEW.: Ok I've had this sub hooked up for a week and am prepared to leave a review. This is the first sub that I've used in 4 years and the first that I've purchased since 2002 or so. Anyway, like all of the other BIC speakers that I've been using for the last year, the build quality is superb. It is really, really well built.It has 2 hookup possibilities that I put to good use. It sits in the corner of the living room behind my desk on a Auralex SubDude and I used a 25' RCA cable to run to my home theater receiver. I was also able to run L and R speaker wire's for my desktop speakers from my Dayton amp through the sub and out to the speakers. I was really suspicious of that route but it is totally quiet, transparent, and introduces zero hum, buzz, or hiss sound, whatever to the desktop speakers.The auto on works very well for both signals and the box is really stout. The crossover is fantastic and the sound is great. I cross it over pretty low because my monitors have good bass. I only have experience with 10's, and limited at that, but this has nice boom, hits hard and really makes all of my music sound deep. My favorite tracks to listen to to demo this sub with my desktop monitors are "Abacab", "Get in Where You Fit In" by Too Short, "Back in the Saddle" by Aerosmith, and most of all for all out deep BANG - "PHD" from Crystal Method's "Tweekend". That last one just hits deep, I can't believe all of the bass I was missing on "Tweekend". I've only just been able to hook it to my home theater receiver today, because I was waiting on the cable, so I'll update this later. I'm super stoked that 1 sub satisfies both of my needs (see pictures if you're confused) and I love BIC which now all of my home speakers consist of.After doing some research, if you experience some hum after hooking it up to your entertainment center chances are the cable tv wire is the culprit. I bought a Jensen VRD-1FF IsoMax Digital RF Isolator that cleared that issue up. It happens despite the brand of sub you're using so don't panic if it happens to you.

$REVIEW.: I know what you're thinking: this sure is a glowing review so she must work for the company. Well, set your mind at ease. I am simply another iPad user just like many of you here, shopping for the most comfy way to sit back, relax and enjoy our new tablets.I originally found the PadPillow on the manufacturer's site but thought I'd check with Amazon for a better price. Boy, am I glad I did! I've only had my iPad for just over a month but have had my Kindle Fire since Christmas. All this time I have constructed a series of pillows and blankets arranged to prop up my devices and make it easier to read e-books, watch movies and type emails. All attemps were frustrating and left kinks in my neck but strengthened my resolved that there MUST be something else better out there! I had a good feeling, based on reviews, that this would be a great product so I eagerly anticipated its shipment. Now that I've been using it for about 3 days I am in LOVE! I want to shout the name of this glorious invention from the mountaintops! It might not be the prettiest pillow on the market (especially my denim blue one) but who cares when using both my iPad and Kindle have never been more comfortable?! I'm even writing this entire review from my PadPillow.The only thing I would recommend is perhaps a tiny strip of Velcro to keep the cone pillow in place so that it doesn't flop all over when you're moving it out of position. However, this is a quick do-it-yourself fix that I plan on completing with materials from Walgreens.And, as another reviewer has so eloquently stated, the pillow needs a tad bit of assistance if you are laying flat in bed trying to read. Just grab a tiny throw pillow and prop it under the back of your PadPillow and voila! Hours of comfortable reading and surfing into the wee hours!Take this humble reviewer's advice: do not waste your money on pathetic imitations. This is the real deal at a great price! You will never need another pillow for your laptop devices ever again! The only problem you might possibly have is...are you prepared to share it with your family? :)

$REVIEW.: I ordered this grip for a photo shoot I had coming up on the weekend
I had just received my new Nikon D7000 on a Tuesday and right away realized I would need a battery grip to balance my telephoto lenses on this small camera
I ordered the grip thinking I would get it before the weekend but by Friday night it hadn't arrived, so I went to the local camera store and bought the genuine Nikon grip for $250
Tuesday the Neewer grip arrived
I closely looked at both grips and tried them on the camera
I couldn't tell the difference


For the amount of money you save I can't see one reason why you would buy the Nikon brand grip


This Neewer grips fits, feels and works like the Nikon, and its $200 dollars cheaper.Some people say there is a small bit of play between the grip and camera, but I found that not to be the case


Both the genuine and Neewer are rock solid.

$review_text.: Pros:Great signal strength. (See full review below)Small in size. (About 5.6 x 5 x 0.9 inches not counting antenna or stand)Color and smoothness matches my Playstation 3?Cons:Manual setup can be confusing if you don't know what you are doing. (Lucky I'm good with technology)The shape of the AC plug may or may not be a problem.Very light-weight. May tip over if wires have high tension.Does not have website logging tool like the WPN824.I purchased this router/AP to replace my Netgear WPN824v2. The Netgear worked great with laptops and computers but constantly dropped connections with my Playstation 3. I bought this based on the reviews of its predecessor, the WHR-HP-G54 which has high ratings. I was not disappointed. I live in a 2 story apartment and the router is in the 2nd floor while my Playstation 3 is on the first. I used to get 80%-90% signal strength on my Playstation 3 with the WPN824 but it kept losing connection constantly or was as slow as dial-up. With the new Buffalo High Powered router it's always at a constant 100% signal and never loses connection. I haven't tested the distance yet but it goes through 1 floor of concrete and lead paint with 100% signal strength.I cannot comment about the included computer software as I prefer to use manual setup. Compared to the WPN824 this router's interface takes some time getting used to, but after 5 minutes I was up and running.One feature that the WPN824 has that this doesn't (or I can't find it) is the ability to log websites that clients visit. I have a few wireless connections that I need to keep a check on.Contrary to a previous review, this product does have WDS in its Wireless Config menu. It allows you to connect Master, Slave, and lower Slave.I would definitely recommend this to anyone.Update 4/20/2013:I've been using this router non-stop since I installed it. It's worked almost perfectly without fault. I've also installed the official Buffalo version of DD-WRT on it and have not encountered any problems. DD-WRT is not necessary unless you want to fine-tune your router. For the most part, the "user-friendly" firmware from Buffalo will suffice most at-home users. Only problem I've had is when you have multiple wireless connections all actively using the internet. It can bog down the router and cause some headaches, but this only happened when I had over 10+ wireless connections all streaming videos and gaming at the same time.

$review_text.: For the first couple of months this cable worked great with little problems. After 4 months went by, the cable began to only play through on speaker. I figured out how to adjust the cable to hear out of both speakers but it was just a matter of weeks before the cable would play nothing at all. The thing was, the wire on the inside was pulling away from the end-piece when I never pull on the wire directly. The cable is a nice thick cable and seems durable, but the weight if the wire hanging down will eventually damage the wire.

$REVIEW.: sign of the times.Have needed 5 of these in the last 2 years, never the same seller or manufacturer. The original OEM power supply felt sturdy and lasted quite a time and was chewed by my dog or else I'd still have it.The Catch-22? An original one from HP costs $75 so I, like most anyone else, thought &#34;well, if the 3rd party cheap one fits at $18, if I get a year out of it, In the long run I'll save.&#34;They never got to 4 months - either the wire would split, the jack would crack, the power supply brick would short out - something. Another $20. Then another, then another. In the end, I've spent maybe $95 on replacements.As I said up top, sign of the times...

$REVIEW.: Just received yesterday so still getting used to all of the functions.  Initial impression: The sound from this unit is very good.  Hooked it up and did a sound test through speakers.  Then I threw a movie into the Blue Ray and did some more fine tuning.  Very satisfied with the sound.  This is a significant upgrade from an old Sony that had lost the "Center Spkr" channel audio.  The big problem with this unit is not the sound quality but the fact that you cannot read the front panel buttons unless you are less than 18 inches away.  When will these manufacturers get smart and light the buttons on the A/V receivers?  Will update this when I get it just the way I want it.
$SUMMARY.: Should have brail functionality on front of unit

$REVIEW.: Although this product is labeled for use with the iPad, iPod, and iPhone... you can actually use this for any MP3 player or Media player that has a standard 3.5mm headphone port. All you have to do is plug it into the headphone jack with the included connector and you're ready to rock! This lamp/speaker is very easy to use and there really isn't any "set up" to do. All you have to do is plug the speaker/lamp into the wall socket. To turn the lamp on, you just tap the power button on the front of it once. To Dim it up or down you just tap the button again except that you hold it down after you press it down. It will start to dim and you just release your finger when you reach the desired brightness. To use the speaker function, there is a different power switch on the back that you switch to "on" position. After it's on, you just insert the headphone jack into your Mp3 or Media player and press play on your device. The speaker/lamp design pushes music through the button of the lamp and through an opening that goes all the way around the lamp. Because of this design, the sound is pushed out evenly throughout the room... from the center of the lamp. The sound of the speaker is actually quite good considering the size of the speaker/lamp. The Mid-level and High end of the frequency sound is pretty crisp and travels well. It has an airy sound and feel to it. The lower end (bass) frequency can be heard too, but like most speakers this size... it's nothing to write home about. For what it is, I think that this speaker/lamp performs well and even better than I had expected. I liked that it used a standard 3.5mm headphone jack/cable so that it's compatible with a wider range of products and not just the Apple line of products.My only small complaints about this product was that the light from this lamp is very cool (blue-ish white) tone instead of a warmer daylight hue. This is only because I prefer a light that is a warm tone. Another small complaint I have is that I wished that the 3.5mm cable was longer. It's very short... perhaps 6 inches in length, so you have to place your Mp3 or Media player very close to the lamp. However, the nice thing is that since it uses a standard cable, you could actually purchase a longer cable and replace the one that came with it. Lastly, as other reviewers have pointed out, it would've been nice to have a standard USB port built into the lamp for charging your phone or media device. However, I didn't take any stars away for this because if you read the description, it clearly states all of the functions and this was not on the list.  Other than those few things, this lamp is very nice and I think it'd be perfect sitting on a table next to the bed so it can be used as a reading lamp and/or speaker :)Pros:-Compatible with most Mp3/Media Players because it uses standard headphone jack input.-Small Attractive and Modern Design-Dimmable-Easy to Use functions with no set up needed-Speaker sounds good for the size and fills up the room nicely-LED lights shouldn't need to be replaced since LED's typically last very long.Cons:-3.5mm Audio Cable is very short (although it is a standard cable which allows you to purchase a longer cable if needed)-The LED light color is a cold bluish white tone. This could be a pro or con depending on your taste.-No USB port for charging functions.
$SUMMARY.: A very decent speaker/led lamp for any MP3 or Media Player

 Not now

 I held up my camera while in a car driving 70mph and took photos out the window and even THEY turned out sharp
 And it's very good at focusing on the object (NOT the window)

$REVIEW.: I should begin with a caveat - this is the first GPS unit I've owned or had any extensive experience handling.  I cannot compare it to a TomTom or Garmin unit because I simply do not have the experience.That said...I've been very pleased with this GPS unit.  It has helped me out numerous times already in the 4 months I've been using it, both on short trips and also on an extended drive from Michigan to Texas, a state I'd never before visited.  By putting in destination addresses (including pre-booked hotel stops, etc.), the GPS actually helped ensure I made the correct turns even when road signage was poor or missing.  I imagine all GPS units provide this kind of service, but it is certainly comforting when you're in unfamiliar territory.  If I did intentionally take a different route than that prescribed by the unit, it quickly adopted my new route and recalculated.  This worked well even in Canada.The Point Of Interest search feature was also very, very handy.  We were able to locate not only nearby attractions, restaurants, etc., but we were also able to search for particular restaurants (i.e. Subway) where members of our group wanted to eat.  It made for a much more relaxing trip.The features are numerous, and on my unit they all work very well with two exceptions - the real-time traffic info and the Bluetooth service for a cellphone.  I live in a small city with no traffic issues, and I prefer a Bluetooth earpiece when driving.  The FM transmitter works, but the signal is weaker than what users may be used to from various iPod devices.  I actually appreciate the weaker signal because it means others will not be listening in on my music. :-)The experience of other reviewers with the unit taking forever to locate the satellites is not one that I have shared.  Within a minute, often within seconds of being powered up, the GPS knows where I am and the direction in which I'm traveling.  As long as you do not turn off the unit main power (sliding switch on the bottom) and use rather the power button on the front of the machine (press to turn on, press and hold to turn off), you never have to set the clock/date.Overall, I'm very impressed with this unit and would buy it again.

$REVIEW.: This was my first foray into the tablet world.  I have an Android 2.2 phone, so I thought it would be an easy extension of that experience.  The tablet feels great, is a decent/balanced weight to hold, and the shortcut keys on the front are responsive and convenient (although as others have said, placement is a little awkward).  The screen clarity and color is also very good.  Drawbacks, again, the AppsLib was not a favorite, but it can be worked around by going to Amazon market for much stuff.  Using the device like a Kindle with more "stuff" was easy.  I'm not a game player, so that limitation didn't bother me.  My biggest "beef" was that the screen was too small for web browsing (which was a big need for me).  I loved the size and weight, it fit well in my purse, but I just couldn't make the small screen work for me.  The wifi does NOT have a great range and can be sluggish (what do you expect with 512K RAM, right).  But, I was only trying to enhance my traveling email/web browsing capability with a larger screen than my phone. I looked at this purchase as a summer travel tool -- and for under $200, I would get my money's worth out of it just for that.  However, the unit I received had two problems (which probably would have been solved if I exchanged it): the charging plug would not stay "clicked in" so there were times the unti was not charging as expected, and 2) the micro SD slot did not function.  I need the added memory of the SD slot, so this was a deal breaker for me (again, an exchange could have solved).  All in all, this is a great little tablet for the money and I would recommend as long as you are not thinking it's an equivilant for iPad or Xoom.  My kids loved playing on it.  I actually chose to get the Coby Kyros 8024 for it's bigger screen, and prefer that size for viewing (although a little more bulky and weighty to squeeze into a purse).  This won't be my last tablet, but it's a good place to start.

$REVIEW.: I bought this receiver to replace a higher end Yamaha receiver that was electrocuted.  My home in Florida gets quite a few lightning strikes and I lost quite a few pieces of equipment.  This is in spite of having top end surge protectors.Anyway, this receiver works okay. Here is what I have experienced with this equipment.The manual is not so good.  It really does not give you a grasp of the context behind the various settings.  It's voluminous, but useless.  You will need some experience to set this up.  The manual will not help.The speaker settings are unusual based on my experience with Pioneer and Yamaha setups.  I have a 5.1 surround sound speaker cluster with large left and right speakers and a large center speaker.The issue I have with the settings is that you CANNOT customize the bass settings to your sub-woofer with the left, right and center speakers set to large.  Crossover settings only work with these speakers set to small.  I wish the manual was more clear about this.  For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why all of this bass was coming through the left, right and center speakers.  The vocal sound (which should be routed through the center) was muddy.  Almost nothing was being piped through the sub-woofer.Another issue is that you can only set the left, right and center speakers to large or small as a trio.  There is no way to set the center speaker distinctly from the two front speakers.Now, I finally set the left, right and center speaker to small.  Set the crossover to 100 Hz and wow... the sound was not too bad.  So in other words, if you have a sub-woofer, you MUST set the left, right and center speakers as a trio to small.  Even if they are capable of a full range of bass.  Also, as a sub-note, my left and right surround speakers are set to small with 200 HZ crossover.Now without a sub-woofer, the bass being piped through the center speaker would still cause dialogue to be muddy because you can't set the center to small if you set the front left and right speakers to large (which you must do for bass).The other issue is this receiver has a relatively high THD (total harmonic distortion).  So, when you crank up the volume you will find that the sound distortion is significant.  If you have a small to medium size room with pretty good speakers, this should not be a problem as the system has little distortion at medium to loud volume settings.  Maximum settings will be unbearable due to distortion.Okay, I have had no problems with the HDMI.  However, our Scientific Atlantic cable receiver will not work right with the HDMI Bravia control on (video will not reliably display on the TV).  I don't need it so it's not a big deal, but for those who use HDMI integration between components, beware.I pipe all of my systems through my receiver (XBOX 360, Wii, Cable, Blu-ray, etc.) and use the receiver as a hub.  The video seems correct.  I don't like to use video up-conversion, but I really don't know how to turn it off as the manual is not clear.  Not been an issue, however so I don't know if a video processor is on or not.  There is no indication either way.The box is big but light.  Also, this unit DOES NOT generate a lot of heat.If you want a cheap receiver that works pretty well.  I recommend this unit.  For me, if it gets zapped, I won't be out the big bucks that I lost when my beloved Yamaha receiver died.  This unit is easily replaceable, works pretty well.  Generates fairly good output and is not too hot.  Decent buy for the money.It is not a high end unit and you will be disappointed if you expect something more than a mid-grade system.Thank you.

I installed amazon appstore since google play can be sideloaded but force closes immediately.needs better firmware update then 2.3.1 It has been sluggish a few times when a few apps have been open. I didn't like the interface too much so I went with golauncher ex. I was surprised it came with 8gb nand storage over the 4gb stated and that you can uninstall the preloaded apps.

$REVIEW.: When the product arrived, it was set up fairly quickly. It seems you must apply changes before moving on - sometimes this process takes a couple minutes.  This long delay is mildly annoying, but not a deal breaker.  Once set up, I updated firmware, and tested it. Seemed fine. Moved it to its final home.  Once there, it kept rebooting itself as soon as it was fully started (about every 2 minutes).  Asus support had 3 suggestions: reset it (no success), update the firmware (can't since it's rebooting constantly), or return it. They also cold-transferred me with no notice, and dropped my call after 15 minutes on hold.  I'm unimpressed.  Lots of promise, no delivery.All that said, Amazon customer service was wonderful.  My call regarding the return was routed very quickly and efficiently, to the right department. The person I spoke with was helpful, and my replacement product was sent very quickly.  I'm thoroughly impressed with how Amazon handles their calls and their customer service.The chasm of difference between how these two companies treat their customers is amazing.  Amazon treats you like a friend -- Asus treats you like a burden.  I usually like Asus products -- but their customer service is horrendous.

$review_text.: After reading all the wonderful reviews from various websites and here, I bought the S414 and how disappointing...1
Terrible focusing

 In autofocus mode, about 30% of the photos come out to be somewhat fuzzy


 I did everything according to the manual, even using the focus rectangles but the pictures still come out unfocused

 This happens both indoor and outdoor


 Maual focusing is even worse
 You need to view the image on the LCD screen for manual focusing


 Since the screen is small, it is very difficult to determine if the image is focused
 Under the sun, you can hardly see images on the LCD screen, so manual focusing is nearly impossible.2
Picture quality is not acceptable

 The pictures are often flat and unlively
 Colors are not as vivid as I would hope
 The date stamp makes the picture looks very unprofessional, since it looks like a large white label instead of having just numeric values

 The numbers show up as blocks instead of having smooth edges.3


Bulky and heavy


 The size and weight of this camera makes it really difficult to carry around

 In order to carry this, I have the wrap it around my neck, making it really difficult to do anything else without it pounding against my chest.4
Boot up time is long

 I had missed a few good pictures simply because it takes longer for this camera to boot up than it takes others.5
Definitely not a point-and-shoot
 This camera is not meant to used as a point-and-shoot camera

 It takes way to long to boot and focus
 By the time you're ready to take a picture, you would've missed the shot


 Not really suitable for people who want to capture spontaneous shots.6

Overdone flash

 The flash cannot seem to readjust for different objects
 It's too bright even for subjects that are upto 2 feet from the lens

 Many of my pictues end up being too bright and unfixable even using the bundled software

 At times, the flash doesn't even come on when there is backlight


 I guess most cameras have flash that don't, but my Canon S230 and Kodak DX4900 does adjust to accomodate so I get great pictures even when there is backlight.7
Odd size lens

 The len's diameter is at an odd 35.5mm
 It is very difficult to find anyone carrying filters of this size cheap
 You may want to consider this if you intend to use any filters for this camera.In my opinion, this camera is over-rated


 Although the price is quite affordable for a 4MP and 4X zoom camera, I would rather pay a bit extra to own a 3.2MP/2X zoom Canon


 The picture quality of the Canon S230 I own, which has 3.2MP, is way better than this camera

 The fact that I can focus 90% of the time with my S230 makes it much better than the S414, not to mention the size difference
 If you're not looking to print pictures greater than 11&quot;x14&quot;, a 3.2MP is more than sufficient


 One important factor is that my S230 is Made in Japan
 The S414 is Made in China

 From my previous experiences with numerous electronic, gadgets that are Made in Japan are far far better in quality than those made in China

 Hope this will help you make a more informed decision.

$REVIEW.: I was looking for a netbook with the latest N450 processor for myself to bring on travel. I previously purchased Dell and Acer netbooks for my kids, so I had some experiences with them. I narrowed down to 2 choices: this HP Mini 210-1010NR and the Acer AO532h. I like them both but decided to go with the HP due to the bigger touch pad. Here are some differences:HP Mini 210-1010: Pos: keyboard style, bigger touch pad, 4.25 hrs standard battery which I prefer to higher capacity battery so it is flush with the case and fits nicely in the sleeve.Neg: the A/C charger cord is bulky, fan running constantly, and the shell attracts finger-print easily.Acer AO532h: Pos: longer battery life (9hrs), Wifi g/n (the HP mini only has g), multi touch pad if you like it, smaller charger cord as a reviewer had mentioned.Neg: small touch padThis is my first experience with Window 7 OS and I really like it. If you had done your research on the Window 7 Starter, you would not be disappointed due to its limitations such as you cannot change your desktop screen, etc. Overall a good machine. I just wish that the charger cord is slimmer. I really like the 1-piece design of the cord of the Dell mini 10 netbook.

$REVIEW.: This is a great product. It took me longer to unpack it than to get it working. I use it outside over wi-fi and indoors over a CAT 5 cable.Either way, setup was simple. answer a few set-up questions and off you go.The sound is quite good for a unit this size but don't expect it to compete with your home theater stuff.My music is loaded on a Buffalo Technologies Linkstation Quad which has an integrated DLNA certified media server. The NP2900 finds it on the network along with any other devices there. Searching your music directories is simple and relatively quick.The Internet radio capability gives you access to loads of free stations worldwide and, so far, has also worked flawlessly.The only minor gripe I have is that the buttons on the remote are quite small and, if you have fat fingers as I do, somewhat difficult to select without pushing the wrong one.

$REVIEW.: Although the product is less expensive than other cases, it does not work well with Kindle Fire HD and the electric cable. You must continually plug and unplug the charging cable to open or close the cover because you can only insert the Kindle in one direction with the cable coming out of the bottom of the case when in the landscape position. Within a few days I realized that this was a waste of money. I wish the company had a better design like the Marware Revolve case which revolves and works as a stand with the cable coming out of the top when in the landscape-stand position. Poor design for the latest Kindle.

$review_text.: I bought this tablet for use with my HP G60 laptop

I was drawn to this model in particular because the pen does not require batteries


Installed easily with Windows Vista, and installation included tutorial for use


Although I initially purchased this product to use with Photoshop to streamline my photo editing workflow, I sometimes use it in place of the mouse for everyday computing because of its ease of use


Small and lightweight, good for travel


The tag on the end of the tablet is handy for holding the pen, however I would recommend purchasing a carrying case if you plan to take it with you on the go as the pen may slip out during travel.

$REVIEW.: I've been doing alot of reseach into a new MP3 player and reading alot of reviews, checking prices, etc. I have an RCA2012 and was not happy with it (see my review regarding the RCA).  I didn't want one with an expansion card (too complex, been there, done that), one that would work with Windows Media & hold most of my songs (which worked out to be 1GB), one small enough so you could hide it in your pocket at work (it measures 2.5 inches by 1.5 inches in it's case), and a case with a belt clip so I could wear it if I didn't have a pocket and didn't want to jog (the case is rubber flexiskin with a rubber belt clip on the back, although it also comes with an armband for those joggers out there).All Creative MP3's are well reviewed and recommended.  Although this price is the lowest for this player, it's a little more than I wanted to pay.  I thought about a 512, but I have more music than that on my computer and experts recommend that you buy the most memory that you can afford.When everyone said how easy this was to download I definately had my apprehensions (last time I tried to download the RCA it took me a trip to the store to exchange it and 8 hours to figure it out, not to mention the damage to my blood pressure).I didn't want to start in the evening because I'm not one for patience and if it didn't work I'd be up all night fuming.  WELL, I took a chance and WOW. My songs are all in Windows Media and it took literally, I'm still amazed, under 10 minutes to install the software (the software will tell you how long you have before you'll be hearing songs on your player) and another 10 minutes to download almost 1 GB to the MP3 player. I am a little past middle-aged and no techno-whiz (if the computer comes on and the internet works I'm happy).  Believe me, if I can get this to work anyone can.Also, the sound on this is astounding. I WOULD definately recommend this MP3 player and from now on will not buy another unless it's a Creative.

$review_text.: This device is great in concept, and this particular model was an excellent choice a couple of years ago.  The concept is still great, but there are better choices out there than this one.  The main problem is that the technology is out of date.  Being purely 802.11b, this still runs at 11Mb/s best case, and maybe half that speed in actual use.  There are other 802.11a and 802.11g options that are several times as fast.Other specific issues I had with this model, and the reasons I say it's quirky, are:a) It couldn't connect to my access point unless the access point broadcast its SSID.  If both devices have the same SSID this shouldn't be necessary, and is less secure.b) If you want to use a channel other than 6, you need to change it from infrastructure to ad-hoc mode, change the channel, and then change it back to infrastructure more.c) It couldn't connect to my access point if the access point was in "mixed 802.11b/g" mode.  I had to switch the access point to 802.11b only.If I were to buy another wireless bridge I'd get one that's 802.11g compatible.

$review_text.: Kensington KeyCover Hard Shell Bluetooth KeyBoard Cover and Stand for iPad 2/3/4 (K39785US)I am writing this review on my new Kensington keyboard attached to my iPad 3. It seemed like what I should do and it's working out pretty well. It's not that great of a cover because there is no protection for the back of the iPad. I consider something a case when it protects the device it covers; don't ask me about Apple's Smart Cover. All that said it's a pretty good keyboard. It uses scissor switches and for the short travel it has a good feel, nice and positive. The layout is fairly typical of a notebook or netbook, very compact and of a Chiclet design. My only gripe is getting one of the arrow keys when trying to shift. At least there are arrow keys, something usually lacking in a virtual keyboard.The iPad snaps onto the keyboard, screen down. When it does it will turn off and when you remove it, it will turn on. The body of the keyboard is made from one piece of anodized aluminum. It is very light and classy looking. The cool factor is high.  There are cutouts to enable easy access to the headphone jack and charging port. There are special Command keys on the Function keys for extra features.  There is a locking stand to support the iPad in three different positions. Rest it in the slot above the keys and it can stand in portrait or landscape, rest it across the keys in landscape for typing on a virtual keyboard or viewing. This last position really doesn't work well; the iPad can slip out of this position. In the two main positions it works great.If you are looking for a really good keyboard that Bluetooth attaches very easily, lasts a very long time on a charge and is well constructed, this is it. I would just keep it in a carry bag to protect the iPad while on the go.
$SUMMARY.: Nice anodized aluminum keyboard cover for iPad

$review_text.: My VideoSecu LCD TV Monitor Ceiling Mount Kit arrived on time and in good condition.  This is a great product and at a great price.  I have a mirrored wall that I needed to mount a TV on, luckily for me I remembered seeing a Ceiling Mount TV holder here some months ago.  I have placed wall mounted TV holders in my house as well as in my family and friends homes, but never a ceiling mounted TV holder, until now.  It looked difficult at first, but after opening the packages it got simpler.  Very easy to install.  Just make sure to screw into the center of the ceiling joist and not the edge of the ceiling joist, I did by using a nail and hammer and tapping into the sheetrock until the nail hit air and not wood.  My electronic stud finder found my ceiling joist, but my hammer and nail found the exact edges of the ceiling joist.  This is a great product.  I give this a 5 star rating.

$REVIEW.: The TV's IR sensor is in a ridiculous position that does not allow for efficient signal reception from anywhere but right in front of the set.  The following fix which works great for me may not work for you but it is offered nonetheless:1) Cut up a 1 1/2" x 4" piece of cardboard.2) Wrap the cardboard with aluminum foil3) Crease the cardboard at a 45 degree angle4) Tape the cardboard to the back of the set directly behind the sensor with the open angle pointing toward your seating area.5) Test the remote from various positions in the roomIf you are one of those who do not want to do this because it detracts from the visual aesthetics of the TV, then by all means continue to whine about the remote or return the TV.For those who are so frustrated with the remote's operation but otherwise like the TV enough to compromise the beauty that is a VIZIO product, then I hope this helps.Update on 27 Dec 2013:  Have had this 50" VIZIO now for two weeks.  With the exception of the user interface for the Amazon Prime App (it sucks), this TV has performed perfectly.  The picture is crazy good, the passive 3D is most definitely the best I have ever seen on a TV and the remote works fine with the fix shown above.  Wireless connectivity works 100 percent of the time.  Have not lost Netflix or Amazon - NOT ONCE!

$REVIEW.: This speed ring works well


The only reason for the 4 stars instead of the 5 is that the sockets for hooking up a softbox are not laid out quite as well
The spacing seems a touch off compared to other speed rings

The only other thing is that if you are taking a soft box from a different non alien bee speed ring the rods might be a touch too long because this speed ring adds a couple inches to the diameter from the other speed rings I use for other strobes.

$review_text.: I've had the board for about a month now and I really do like it, the bois is so easy to use for over clocking fan setup and so on and you can even use your mouse in it but the thing to note is that this is not a high end board.  I got this board thinking $90 was allot for a MB and that this one was pretty high end but I was wrong and should have done more research for my first gaming PC build but that aside this thing is great I've got a Gigabyte HD 7870 on it an FX-6300 CPU and a Sandisk extreme 240GB ssd for the main parts of the build and all of it works except the fact the FX-6300 CPU needed a bois update in order for it to be compatible which wasn't a problem seeing how I had an old Phenom 2 X4 945 denub from an old build to get the bois update completed and the windows installation done.  The board is pretty great even though I have a PCIe 3.0 graphics card it is backwards compatible to this MB's 2.0 PCIeX16 slot but the motherboard does not support the crossfire of my graphics card with its PCIeX4 slot.  As for usb 3.0 my phone is the only thing I have than can use it but its very fast and this MB will be my first time using that as well.  The raid is an easy feature to use to but I ended up not needing that much power and put the other SSD in my other computer, along with two of the sticks of ram leaving only 16GB on this Gigabyte board (32GB of ram is way more than anyone needs, it barely reached 20% in heavy use!)  Again on the bois update the Q-Flash is really easy use, it said was dangerous and need not be done unless absolutely necessary but I had to do it twice and it went very well didn't take no more than a minuet each time, but once it was done and the FX-6300 was in I was very impressed with the 3.5GHz 6-core. really liking both AMD and Gigabyte right now and seeing how i only spent $1020 on the entire build is plus, all the games i play default on max settings!

The pad on the upper part keeps the device in place.This stand has so many possible positions that you can use it with just about any device.  It is easy to change the stand and it stays in place even while you are playing games on the Kindle Fire.  My son tried it with his Nexus 7 and it worked fine.It is easy to use and can be used right out of the box--no assembly needed.  The "arms" stay in place so they are not moving around but are easy to adjust even when your tablet is on it.It is very compact when folded up and easily fits in a purse or bag.  It feels very durable and should last very long.  The price was very nice also.

$REVIEW.: This is my seventh Olympus camera.  While it took the supplier an inordinate amount of time to ship it, the camera itself is very nice.  I've been playing with the settings to figure out what works best for me. So far so good.  As a professional photographer with a few photos published on the New York Times Best Seller list, cameras are not a stranger to me.  I back pedaled from an Olympus DSLR camera which broke to this one. I'm convinced the camera is a tool and I'm the master of the tool.  While I can change a majority of settings to do just about as much as my DSLR, I'm not finding any misgivings for purchasing this camera.  I've had my eye on it for several months and have done much research on it.The only item I don't like is where they have the chip located.  It's next to the battery compartment and you have to open the battery compartment door to get to it.  If you're not careful when opening that door, I am concerned the door could be broken off by accident.  Not only that, the batteries could fall out.Another issue that I've found a bit annoying is the chance the camera turns on video/movie mode if you press the red button (on the back of the unit) by mistake.  I turned it on multiple times.  Fortunately, when I went to snap a photo, the camera did capture the photo at full resolution which I had set it to do.  It stopped the video mode so as to take the picture.  This is a good thing.  However, it resumed the video recording once the picture was processed.  If you don't see it recording, there is a chance you could fill up the chip and then you have to contend with deleting what you filmed by accident.  Both time consuming situations as well as power drain on the batteries.

$review_text.: I bought this because the TuneDok I used to slip my iPhone in does not fit my new iPhone.  When I saw that this was universal and fully adjustable to fit various devices, I thought it would be perfect.  The ratings were mixed - some totally loved, some totally not.  But I took a chance anyway and so far, I've been pleased with it.  The padding in the holder section itself is nice and thick.  It provided a solid grip without any risk of scratching.  The adjustments could use a little work - clicking it open is one thing but to tighten it, you just squeeze it together.  It is a little tall so I had to reach over it when I want to change gears.  That was a little inconvenient.  It took awhile to get the adjustment to the neck right so that it was out of the way but still in a good spot where I can see and reach it with ease.  (I ended up having to bend it all the way flat then tilted the head upwards and to the left so it was more toward my right knee, bringing it out of the way of the gear shift.)  However, it doing all this adjusting to the neck, I noticed that the telescoping plastic moulding that had popped out at the base - probably because the neck just didn't go that far down in the direction I pressed.  Not too crazy about that but not too bad since it was only one side that popped up.  The other thing I found was the adjusting cup base doesn't adjust very well.  It came fully closed and it took a lot of twisting before it finally started expanding.  At first, I thought it was broken because no matter how much I turned the dial, it never expanded.  Finally, it started to expand then I turned the dial the other way to release it but it never pops back.  You have to physically squeeze the tabs together to shrink the cup base.  That is inconvenient, especially if you're in the car trying to adjust it.  I'm not sure if it's made that way or if I just got a bad one.  For now, I guess I'll live with it but I will be contacting the manufacturer to check and see if it's designed that way or if it's broken.  Bottomline, it works for what I need it to do  Not sure if I would recommend it to anyone - it serves my need but it's not something I absolutely love (like my TuneDok.)

$REVIEW.: What a difference this device makes. It fits the Vita perfectly and holds it securely. With the grip in place, all the buttons are easily accessible and accidentally touching the rear touchpad is eliminated. It has a nice non slippery texture and it feels very well made. When used, the charger port and game slot are covered. A minor annoyance but understandable considering the locations on the device. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is the ends of the grip have a fairly sharp point. After a while, the grip digs into my hands making it a bit uncomfortable to hold. This could have been eliminated by rounding off the ends. As a workaround, I just hold the grip higher up; not ideal, but acceptable. Despite this flaw, I still consider this grip a must have accessory. I never use the Vita without it.

$REVIEW.: This case does the job but adds more bulk to the already bulky Aura HD. The bottom line is that it protects the reader when it's in my bag effectively.It falls short when compared to similar cases I have used in the past for other devices. In particular, the Speck Products FitFolio line for Nook and the Omoton Kindle cases are superior both in their feel - they provide more grip and don't feel as bulky - and in the mechanism used to keep them closed.Compared to those cases, this one doesn't feel quite as good when you hold it and the cover tends to slide around when closed (there is no clasp and the spine is not rigid enough to hold it in place). On the whole, though, this case works well.

$REVIEW.: I received these as a gift and have been very satisfied with them.  The sound is clean and clear and they just look cool.  I have had them for three years now and have had zero problems with them even moving them to and from college.The system does have a few quirks.-No power switch.  I thought this was odd, but for what ever reason Harmon/Kardon didn't design one on this set.  It does have a mute function.  Tap both volume buttons simultaneously and it prevents the annoying feedback you get when you unplug them from your computer.  I found this out on my own, which leads to my next gripe.-Poor instructions.  Most systems indicate left and right channels and explain functions and features.  I have noticed with other Harman products that while their instructions have excellent diagrams, they tend to lack much written instruction.  Which speaker is the left and which is the right?  And that mute function.  Not listed in the instructions.-Lastly, and this is just my observation, I think the subwoofer should have some kind of protection covering the vent port.  Has anyone ever dropped something in it?  Or wondered about debris getting inside?  I haven't had any problems with this, but it's just my observation and something I thought Harman should address.Overall, I have been very pleased with this set.  Again the sound is AWSOME!  But it does have a few quirks that could make or break a buyer's decision.  I do believe that anyone who buys these will be pleased.

$REVIEW.: I purchased with a doubt that it would work but of course reading the amount of positive reviews decided it


You have to understand that everyone will have a different opinion of this product due to where you live and where this antennae is placed in your home
The first TV I tried was in my basement

My Tv sits to one side of the basement against a wall right in the middle

I have a window and a walkout door right next to the TV

I couldn't get not one station to come in at all


Also the product is very light and weak equivalent to a fly swatter maybe smaller

If you have to stand this it will tip over very easily


The suction cup it comes with doesn't even work for me
I even stuck it on glass and it wouldnt stay

Being that it is very small and light it moves around way too much
Even a fan blowing will be too much.I tried my TV upstairs and was able to get around 16 channels and they came in pretty good
However where the antennae had to be placed to get that good reception wasn't going to work
Basically in front of my closet doors! I could not gain proper reception in an ideal placement.I live 20 miles west of Chicago as well so I should be getting good reception
However I think its going to take a better antenna placed in more of a ideal location.

Of course I had to spend quite some time looking on the reviews and internet to figure out which plug style to get.....all for a &lt; $5 purchase.  Grrrr.Why the heck is it so difficult to figure out which plug (3 or 4 contact) is used on a phone?  The cell phone manual tells you nothing about the headphone jack specs.  I can tell you that this will probably work on most Motorola and Nextel cell phone.  BUT I tried it on a friends blackberry and it would not work.  You would need a 3 contact style plug for those phones.

$review_text.: This is the first of 3 cameras I purchased.  With a little understanding of networks, this camera was simple to setup.  It is very stable and has a rock solid picture over Wi-Fi.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the audio quality.  The Wi-Fi antenna causes a repetitive buzz in the audio.  Mounting the camera up side down or moving the antenna away from the camera head removes some of the noise but not all of it.  This camera needs shielding between the audio circuitry and the CPU / Data circuits.It is noisier than others when you turn it and it can be heard through the audio loudly.  As for picture quality, both in the dark and during the day it is pretty good for the price point.  The picture in the dark is amazing, lights up the whole room, does better than it states. (~16 feet or 5 meters).  This camera lights up brightly 20 feet away without adjusting brightness or contrast.While it lacks the ability to use sound triggers for recording with their Blue Iris software due to the internal noise and AGC circuitry, this is an amazing camera for the price.  Works very well using motion detection on maximum and doesn't give any false alarms due to picture instability or noise from compression.  Uses about 2.5 Mb/s (megabits per second) Wi-Fi bandwidth.  Most 802.11(G) routers will handle 21 Mb/s so you can put quite a few of these cameras on your Wi-Fi without much lag.  Frame rate for me has been about 15-18 fps which is lower than advertised but still acceptable.

$REVIEW.: It works for it's purpose.  It securely holds my IPOD+nike device while I'm running.  I can still use all the buttons on my Ipod to include turning the voluming up and down as well as changing songs when needed.  It fits my arm securely as well which is a relief being some other models are made for skinny arms.  One minor downfall is the fact that I have no convenient way to adjust my long cord from my headphone.  I used to be able to wrap the excess cord around the armband itself with my old holder, but on this one it doesn't seem feasible.  The headphone plug is located on the backside of the armband closer to the arm so this does help out a bit.  The other inconvenience is that everytime I want to upload my runs, I have to pull the ipod out of the armband to hook it up to my laptop.  It's a very snug fit, so it takes some effort to pull out.  Also, I'm always at risk of losing the nike + adaptor since I have to pull it from the ipod before uploading my workouts.  I've resorted to keeping the adaptor in the sleeve until I'm ready to plug it back in to my ipod.  There is another armband that has an opening in the bottom of the sleeve that allows you to upload workouts without removing the ipod from the sleeve.Overall, I like the armband...it fits my arm...and does what I need it to do.  The other issues like I said are inconveniences and not necessarily deal breakers.  I did buy the armband on sale which is also a plus

$REVIEW.: I wanted to give no stars on some of the attributes, that option should be available Amazon.Bought this because I thought the HP one for laptop was a bit steep in price--$50.00. Never fails, every time I try to save money buying other than manufacturer suggested item, it comes back and bites me in the tushy.  First, the mini cd DID NOT work in my dvd/cd drive. So went to website and tried to download that way. Didn't work, so then called tech support, got a tech that was obviously bothered by my call, kept callling me sir, (female here) after letting him know several times that he was incorrect, finally gave up. So I download drivers, oh btw, the adapter was VERY hard to insert into UBS slot, and I did inform the tech of this and asked if it was normal, after several "umm, umm's," he said "oh yeah that's ok." For some reason his reply didn't leave a warm and fuzzy feeling inside me.So get it installed, and after having to resolve several "error" messages finally send test page to printer from approximately 15-20 feet away. Well lo and behold, it worked just fine printing the test page. Never printed any document again, unless of course I was sitting right next to printer with laptop in lap sending document to printer.Would I recommend it??? Not in this lifetime or any other.

Note that high frequency sound is much more directional than low frequency sound. The rechargeable batteries are good as well. This speaker is much larger than I expected which makes it more suitable for car trips rather than airplane trips. Although the bluetooth connectivity is good, it sometimes glitches and then refuses to pair with devices. Then, it appears that the only way to get it to pair with a device is to perform a factory reset:1. Turn on your wireless boombox2. Press and hold the Volume Up and Down buttons for 10 seconds. The bluetooth status light should blink briefly for 1-2 seconds.It can only connect to one device at a time. On power-up, it will try to connect to the last device used. If you want to connect to a different device, you must manually disconnect your device from the speaker first.

$review_text.: You will have to have 1) mounting kit ; 2) wiring harness in order to get it to work

 It showed on a search for my year and make vehicle and stated Nothing about needing the 2 additional items which will be an additional $35 to purchase

 I have no clue what it sounds like as I'm trying to find a wiring harness that will work

 The one they suggest getting with the radio is a joke
 It doesn't remotely resemble the actual plug other than being made of plastic and wire.I wish if something states that it is made for your make / model that it would actually plug in and work
 Is that too much to ask?  Really


 If additional kits are needed, shouldn't they be listed or suggested with the item?I would give it a ZERO if I could because I'm a little miffed at the false advertisement


 I hope it actually works once I can track down a wiring harness

 I found the mounting kit for $17 and it looks like a &#34;real&#34; wiring harness will be at least $13.

Everything works with the USB cable...no external plug-ins.  It transferred information fast and easy.  I love knowing I have a backup for personal and important information.  Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: My 1st thought was how it could be priced so high when I saw this product on amazon.com, it's just a phone stand, right? But after I received the package and opened the box, everything became self-explanatory. The stand is extremely well designed and built, and my iphone 5s fits in perfectly. I do quite a bit of facetime with my overseas relatives and friends, I used to grab a whole stack of hardcover books to elevate my phone so the other party could see me while I was sitting on the couch with the coffee table in front of it. No more such hassles, with this stand, I can easily position my iphone by adjusting its height and angle. I absolutely love this stand, I would rate it 10-star if I could.

I usually take the filter off when I am shooting and put it back on as soon as I am done shooting. I just want the filter to protect my front lens from accidental scratches when my lens cap falls of while carrying it in the camera bag or someone rubs fingers against it.

$REVIEW.: This item works pretty well, but it's very sensitive about the surface you use. If you use anything that's not completely flat (i.e. some fabric surface) the cursor tends to get all shaky. If you want to use it for gaming, this could be problematic. It does work on glass as advertised, which is cool.I also tried using this on a different floor from my receiver and it works OK as long as you're still within 25 feet or so from it, but when it disconnected I often had to power-cycle to get it to reconnect.Battery life is pretty good. I don't use it terribly often, but I haven't changed mine since I started using it about 2 months ago and rarely turn it off, so standby seems to not drain it.

$review_text.: I saw this in a big box store, so I played around with it for about 20 minutes. Even with the highest configuration ( core i,7. 256GB SSD, 8GB of ram) this laptop has a very serious shortfall.Pros:-Very thin & light. Highly portable.-Good keyboard-Decent track padCons:*My main con is the screen, so I'll break it down.-The vertical viewing angle is abysmal, everything washes out with a few degrees of shift. Even looking straight on, the quality is unacceptable, the resolution and brightness do not matter. Horizontal viewing angle was about 90 degrees.-Samsung is known for making some solid screens, this is a surprising let down. At this price the laptop should come with an IPS or PLS display. It can be done in a thin body, Apple has done it in the iPads for example.-When I was viewing videos and looking for pictures, the color shifting was awful. This may suffice as a very basic system, but you can get a cheaper laptop if you need portability and basic functionality.- Wait for an upgrade on this panel, skip this.

$REVIEW.: If any company could build a consumer tablet and do it right, that company is Sony.  The S1 is an Android tablet done right.  Build quality is first-rate.  The angled (book-like) design of the S1 is cleaver and functional.  The screen (with its deep blacks) is outstanding.  The tablet is very comfortable to hold and carry.  I've only had the tablet for a few hours, but I am very impressed.  Setup out of the box was simple.  After an initial charge, I was up and running in no time at all.  I was a little surprised that Sony didn't include any documentation (other than a Quick Start sheet, and the usual warranty and end-user license agreement), but documentation wasn't really needed... and it is available on-line if necessary.  Amazon -- thank you.  You promised quick delivery and, as usual, you came through.  I'll update this review as I continue to explore the device, but if you are looking for a first-rate Android tablet, consider the Sony S1 -- you won't be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this case as as gift for my mother to protect her new Kindle Fire.  The front cover can be folded back to be used as a stand for the Fire which is a nice feature, but it isn't anything unique as a large number of cases on the market are designed the same way.  The case itself is on the cheap side, made from inferior materials.  In order to keep the front cover closed, the back of the case has a band of elastic that you fold around the front.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cases I have owned for other electronic devices, but the elastic closure is just a poor design given all the other slick methods I have experienced for closing cases.  All in all this is a below average case.  At $30, there are so many more options out there that are cheaper and better than this case.  I have to recommend passing on this one.

$review_text.: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Summary of my installation~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I live in New England and I wanted to have a solution that allowed me to remotely monitor the house and record activity of anyone that may be coming or going.  Fortunately, I had planned ahead when the house was being built and ran Cat5E cabling throughout the house and left cabling for future cameras.  I wanted to find a solution that had PoE cameras so that I could use this type of cabling and not worry about local power to each of the cameras or deal with special (perhaps, legacy/old) camera cabling.  I recently installed this solution and the SEB-1005R outdoor cameras seem very solid.  They have a nice metal casing.  My only complaint is that the gray cable comes out the back of the unit and is exposed.  I would have definitely preferred for the cable to be hidden in the mounting bracket.  This would not only help with further protection against the elements, but also more protection against possible vandalism.  I ended up mounting a white all weather junction box next to the cameras so that my Cat5E house cabling would come in behind the box and then the camera cable would enter from the side.  So, I have about 3-4 inches of exposed cabling.  This provides a fairly clean look, plus the camera connector is further protected by being inside the box.  The SED-1001R cameras are sharp looking, but I'm not a fan on how the cable comes out either.  I also mounted a junction box next to it to manage the cabling so that there wasn't much that was exposed.  I would have really love if Samsung sold mounting bracket accessories (or included them in the package) that would have provided the perfect OEM solution for hiding these cables.  I would have bought them and gladly paid a modest upgrade charge.  Even so, I picked up some parts at my local home improvement store to complete the install (single gang outdoor, all-weather box and cover, and caulking for each camera).  My outdoor cameras are high, up under the roof eaves and I also have some on my front porch up high.It has been noted in a few reviews that the DVR fan is loud.  It surely isn't quiet, but I would compare it to the same level of noise that I have with my DirecTV DVR.  Plus, the unit is kept in my basement, so I'm not around it all the time to be bothered by it.Soltech is a great Amazon partner and you can actually swap out cameras for a minimal charge.  For example, I didn't need four indoor and four outdoor cameras; I needed two indoors and six outdoor cameras.  They were fantastic and was very fast in shipping my order.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Some Local SDE-5001 configuration tips~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Device- Camera: I turned off the unused channels.  Also, I gave each channel a user-friendly name (ie. garage, porch, etc).* Record- Event Record Duration: for events, I set a five second pre-event with post event time of one minute.  That way, with motion events, I'll see a few seconds before the item that triggered the event.- REC Quality & Resolution: I'm not an expert at this section.  Basically, you have three resolution options: CIF(S), 2CIF(M), and 4CIF(L); along with record rate of 1fps to 30fps; plus, record quality range of "Level1 (Low)" to "Level8 (High).  The system has some internal formula limitation so if you have many cameras, you can't simply give them all the best options.  Right now, I have eight cameras and all have the resolution settings of "4CIF(L)".  The record rate is factored into the formula because I can only give three cameras "9 fps", four cameras the "8 fps" and the remaining two cameras have "7 fps".  I can adjust the record rate to a higher number, but I would then need to lower the resolution setting.  The record quality doesn't have any effect on the formula restriction, so I use the best on this field.  Even so, I'm happy with the images because I could get some good shots of an unknown car coming to my house and get some good profile information about any people that get out; but, their license plate isn't going to be sharp and I probably wouldn't be able to zoom in to check out any tattoo that may be on their forearm (this equipment wouldn't be used by the CSI team).  Regardless, I have been able to tweak these settings and get them to an acceptable point for me.  NOTE: obviously, the local monitor has the best picture while quality on the web browser and smartphone app aren't as good.* Event- Motion Detection: I enabled motion triggers for each of the cameras and you can adjust the sensitivity using a scale of 1-10.  Plus, you can set the motion region for each camera too.* Network- Mailing Service/SMTP: I set this up so that I can get alerts.  I'm mostly concerned about video loss and I will get an email if a camera goes offline (whether network/system failure or if someone were to cut a camera cable).  Comcast is my home provider so server setting is "smtp.comcast.net" and port is "587".  You must enable authentication with them and fill in your username and password.  For the sender field, I made up an email address from my personal domain (ie. homealert@MYDOMAIN.com).- Event: select the items for which you wish to receive alerts.  I selected Change P/W, Video Loss, HDD info, and Power on/off.  NOTE: the option to include the "motion" alerts is very cool.  Basically, if motion is detected, the system will send you an email with a screenshot attachment of the motion.  Keep in mind, that you may be overwhelmed with many messages if your motion detection threshold is set high.  For example, I originally set this up and was getting tons of messages because there were leaves blowing in my front yard.  I'm going to continue to make adjustments to the motion detection scale to see if I can get the right config for me.  I want to make sure that I capture people and cars going by, but ignore any of the small items.- Group: You have to "Add" a group (I called mine "Alert") and then make the selections (I selected the same as I had on the "Events" tab).- Recipient: "Add" a new recipient and click "Apply".  After you have completed all four of these pages, then you can go back to the "SMTP" tab and click the "Test" button to see if it works.  Also, you can unplug a camera cable to ensure that you get your "video loss" alert.  In addition to using an email address, you can also enter in the SMS address for your phone (ex. 10-digit-TN@vtext.com for Verizon Wireless cell phones).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~iPOLIS/smartphone app~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Reference: my phone is running version 2.2.2 although iPhone app store lists 2.2.1 as the current version.Here is some information that may help getting this working for you.  Please note that if you are going to access this from an Internet connection outside of your local network, then you will need to register the device at the Samsung iPOLIS website.* I created two "Devices" on my phone: one to use while I'm at home on my local/wireless network and one that I'm away ("Home" and "Away").  Initially, I was stuck that I could not connect to this device at home, but I realized that my phone was on my local network and the phone app was attempting to use Samsung's DDNS service which is not going to work unless I'm on a different network.1. "Home" profile (at my home while on my wireless network -- same IP network as Samsung system).* "Name": technically, you can use anything that you want in this field (I went with "Home").* Model: "DVR"* Host: local IP address to your Samsung DVR (most likey is 192.168.X.X or 10.0.0.X address -- it's part on your configuration).* RTSP PORT: "4524" (for reference, my system has TCP port range of 4520-4524 in its configuration)* ID: this is the ID that you use to locally log into your DVR.* Password: again, local password to your local DVR.2. "Away" profile (outside of my home coming in via Internet)* Name: technically, you can use anything that you want in this field (I went with "Away").* Model: "DVR"* Host:  [...].  This is a little confusing in their documentation.  You use your device's "Product ID" name (Settings>Network>DDNS>Product ID) and this same value should be used when you register your product at the iPOLIS website .  If you register with their site and you a different product ID name, then you won't be able to remotely access your DVR/video feed.* RTSP PORT: "4524" (for reference, my system has TCP port range of 4520-4524 in its configuration)* ID: this is one of the unclear parts... this is the local ID that you use to locally log into your DVR -- this may be different than your profile registration at the iPOLIS website.* Password: again, local password to your local DVR.NOTE: If you use a different login scheme with the online iPOLIS site, you actually don't use those credentials with this smartphone app.I installed the app on my phone and also on my wife's phone.  We both can use the app, but only one person can access the video feed at one time.  If I log into the app and she is viewing it, it gives me a warning that the admin account is currently in use and asks whether I want to proceed or not.  If I proceed, then it stops the video stream to her phone and my phone will start viewing the video feed.  This same behavior occurs when remotely accessing feed via browser too (next section).  The bottom line, is that the unit can only support one remote connection at one time.  This isn't a problem for us.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~IE access~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Once you register your device at the iPOLIS website, in addition to use the smartphone app, you can remotely access your system via any Internet connection via the Internet Explorer web browser.  Surprisingly, in addition to the video feeds, you can remotely reconfigure your device too.  Nearly all of the options are available via this UI.  This is really nice because there are a few times that I've wanted to make a change and I could do that outside of my home (note: the smartphone app is exclusively focused on video feed access, while IE gives you "setup" access too).  For example, you can rename cameras, change the recording quality and resolution, change your email alert configs, etc.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Summary~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Highlights:* iPOLIS mobile app (huge selling point for me!!)* PoE-enabled cameras (cabling is a snap)* Camera housing for SEB-1005R/outdoor is solid (very sturdy and seems that it should survive the outdoor elements)* Good/acceptable quality video (provides me with what I need)Lowlights:* Day time clarity isn't nearly as sharp as the sample images (most manufacturers/restaurants/everyone-else uses this technique so this isn't unexpected)* Night vision isn't good (this is acceptable to me for the cost savings compared to higher end products, plus, I have motion floodlights at my house)* Exposed cabling from cameras (there is about 3-4 inches of cabling that is exposed in my solution)Bottom line:Solid solution at a really good price.  If I wanted to spend more money, I could have had perhaps found the "perfect" solution, but it would have been much more expensive.  I've bought AXIS HD cameras for my work environment and obviously these HD cameras produce a much better image, but they also come with a premium price too.  For example, I have experience with the AXIS M3204 cameras, but two of these cameras are nearly the same as this entire Samsung solution.I'm really happy with this system.  The iPhone app is one of the best aspects because I can always remotely check in at the house.  I love the solution and can accept some of its limitations.  I've had this for about a month now and plan on posting a followup after the first full year.UPDATE 5/22/2014: I still love this solution.  Before I purchased the system, I contacted the manufacturer since the literate states that the cameras operate down to temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit.  Living in New England, we go many months during the winter where we never reach 32 degrees.  They responded by stating that they "haven't received any returns or complaints about the defective cameras due to cold weather."  So, I went for it and happy to report that I had no problems this past winter -- even on the coldest days where we had overnight temperatures well below zero.  Plus, this past winter were experienced the "Polar Vortex" which really tested the system.  In summary, all is still well with the DVR, smartphone app, and cameras.
$review_summary.: Wonderful solution at a great price / love the smartphone app!

$REVIEW.: First off, install was simple and painless with the included disk, and the speeds this adapter gets, when compared to previous gen N adapters is amazing.  I used this on a commputer with an N adapter that could never achieve much over 100mbps due to low signal strength and interference. With this adapter, that same computer is able to achieve a little over 500mbps.  Sure, it doesn't get the max speeds, but it's in an area that only gets about 3 out of 5 bars in signal strength and has a lot of other wifi interference, so I didn't expect perfect speeds.  I have this connected to the matching Belkin ac1200 router and it is working great.  At first, it seemed to connect only at N speeds even tho the router was configured to broadcast A,N and AC. However when I changed the 5ghz band from the 20 to the 20/40/80 setting thien this adapter was able to kick in at the much faster AC speeds.  After a week of using, it works great - no issues and no dropouts, so I'm more than satisfied with it.

$REVIEW.: Since I own an iRiver MP3 player, I decided to "stay with the brand". Observations:1. The case is plastic and rather flimsy, especially those teeny-tiny nubs they call buttons. I had to force the device into the cigarette lighter--I thought I would break the thing since the springs that hold it in are quite stiff.2. In the driveway it sounded pretty good. Not too much distortion or static, but on the highway ... very distorted, with a lot of FM interference. I tried changing frequencies (I haven't tried them all, yet), but I was unable to find one where it was "happy". And yes, I plugged it into the LINE OUT jack (no eq or volume adjustment) on the player. The sound was noticeably worse when I plugged it into the headphone jack.3. (Minor gripe) In my car the lighter adapter is "backward", meaning I can't quite see the face of the device.I'm not sure, since most other brands seem to suffer the same sorts of distortion problems, that ANY FM transmitter is worthwhile. I'd even pay more money to get one that actually worked. I guess it's back to XM radio, for me.

$REVIEW.: MarBlue makes great screen protectors.  As a veteran of many types of these protectors on many devices, I can say that the end result has less to do with the actual product than it does with preparation and steadiness of hand.Read the instructions several times before beginning.  Thoroughly clean the screen and make sure it's dry.  This screen protector is designed for the new Kindle HD, with the buttons on the back.  Some schools of thought require installation in a steamy bathroom, but suit yourself.  I've found that despite all efforts there will invariably be a stray hair or dust particle trapped under the protector, and a couple of air bubbles.  Oh, well.The screen protectors themselves are good.

$review_text.: So far this mouse does everything I need it to do


It is able to scroll horizontally and I was able to program the wheel button to open up dashboard and the side button to open up expose on my mac which are two very important things for me


I do notice a little bit of lag with the mouse even when using it on a wood surface which I'd think it would be able to track perfectly on


It's not too bad but I notice that it does not very responsive to slight movements which is just a tad annoying
Also, I'm not a huge fan of the clickless scroll wheel
It would be fine if you could not visually see the clicks on the screen but you can

It's a bit disconcerting (for lack of a better word) to feel the smooth scrolling under your finger but to still be able to visually see the clicks on the screen
I mean, the scrolling on the screen jumps or stops for a second as if it's responding to having reached a ridge in the scroll wheel.


Hopefully that makes sense, having trouble describing what I mean
I do like the small size of the receiver and the fact that the left and right mouse buttons click very quietly


The wheel button is a bit loud when clicked but not too big of a deal.

$REVIEW.: Everything about the computer works great.  It is easy to set up and the Macros are very useful.  I also really enjoy having control of almost everything from my keyboard, volume, speakers mute, mic mute, pause/play etc. all one one device instead of cluttering my desk with multiple devices.  The LCD has a number of settings, and you can download more if you desire, but most are for older games, so I typically use the clock setting.  I only have two issues with the keyboard.  In order to fit everything on a reasonably sized keyboard, all the buttons are ever so slightly smaller then a typical keyboard.  So if you have big hands (like I do) it can get a little uncomfortable to type on for extended periods of time.  The other is the back lighting on the keys.  Some keys are brighter then others and are not all every evenly lit, but that is purely an aesthetic issue.  All and all, satisfied with the keyboard and would recommend it if you are looking for these features.

$REVIEW.: I got this case for my new computer, and it's been in use for about a month. It's a solid case, and feels sturdy without being overly heavy.The first thing you should know is that the picture set probably undervalues the case in terms of fan mounts. Not shown is that it has one 120mm fan mount on the bottom of the case, and two on the top- if you wanted to order a double 120mm radiator water cooling system, like an H100, this case does have a place to mount it.Pros:Excellent valueSturdy constructionNumerous (6) 120mm fan mountsBottom mounted power supplyAbility to swap CPU coolers without motherboard removalRoomy- you could probably fit just about any graphics card on the market in this case. It has at least 12&#34; of clearance between the PCI mount and hard drives.Blue LED fan looks nice without looking gaudy- this entire case strikes an excellent balance between a conservative look and a gamer look.Cons:Front ports are a little outdated. There's no USB3 or eSata, just 2xUSB 2.0 and audio in/out.No real cable management- there's a good inch or two gap between 3.5&#34; bays and the side to stow your extra cables though, so it doesn't look *awful*.The PCI card covers are rather difficult to remove.The power and hard drive LEDs are extremely bright when looking at them dead-on. This is an issue for me as my tower is oriented towards my bed. This isn't anything that would light up your room in a different orientation though.Overall, I'd say if I was doing it again, I'd probably pick this case. It'd be nice to have front USB 3, but I can use a hub if it ever becomes necessary to swap out external hard drives regularly. If you want to get the most out of it though, I'd recommend buying at least three or four additional 120mm case fans.

$REVIEW.: I bought these hoping that they would be better than the HBS-700 (orange older model). The sound quality is definitely better other than that I could careless about the battery &#34;alert&#34; every time you turn them on it will say &#34;battery level high/medium/low&#34;. I would like an option of a button to hear the current time over that. Another difference is that with the 730's you cannot turn the volume down all the way with the headset if you are listening to music (on the 700's you can..I miss that). The very bad with these 730's is the Bluetooth range (it really sucks compared to the 700's). I paint in various factories all over the U.S. & I generally throw my phone (Galaxy S3) on the charger all day & just stream music 8-10+ hours a day. With the 700's I can get 300-500+ feet away from my phone in an &#34;open factory&#34; no walls blocking my Bluetooth. I tried the 730's in the same building & I was lucky to get 50-100+ feet away & the signal would start to cut in & out. I know if you have walls between your phone & the headsets that it will greatly reduce your range.I bought the 700's over a year ago (summer 2012) & they still work great I just had problems with the magnetic ear buds & the clips that hold the excess wires on the top of the headset, but after a couple of months they stay on there fine. I paid $50 for the 700's & I bought the 730's as a back up to my 700's for $45 earlier in 2013.I just decided to use the 730's as a lawn mowing/yard work headset & just leave my S3 in my pocket & they work fine.LG needs to go back to their testing or older Bluetooth for the range on the 700's.If you can have your phone on you or within a short distance then go for the 730's. I don't think you can really beat the price for what you get.I've never had any issues with calls on them. They work great with Pandora, because you can skip/pause/play.I used a paint marker on the 700's to get rid of the annoying orange & button icons since I work in company's that require hearing protection from time to time...besides the blue flashing status light they can't really tell that they are a headset & I've never gotten in trouble for wearing the various company's that we do work for.Hope I didn't ramble too much...the battery life is excellent on these also, but if you don't use them for a week or 2 you should just throw them on a charger & charge um up (love that they are a micro charger..so you can use your phone charger on them with no problems).

$REVIEW.: This keyboard is nice looking to be sure, and I agree with the positives given in other reviews. Thus I'll cover the surprising bits, particular in relationship to the older Apple Pro Keyboard.The power draw is higher. Previous versions worked fine with various unpowered USB hubs. No longer. It now has to go directly into the computer's USB ports. Fortunately, the hub inside the keyboard is USB 2.0 and can source a good amount of current, so you can chain your hub off of the keyboard instead of the other way around.The width and height is slightly less than a normal keyboard, mostly by making the delete, backslash, return, shift and space more narrow. It's done to match the laptop keyboard spacing. This takes some getting used to.The left edge is sharp not curved, which suddenly becomes noticeable if you often have your pinky there while typing.I find that Aluminum has a very unpleasant, draining energy to it when touched, similar to the edgy feeling you get when a wifi or cell phone transmitter is nearby.If you switch the keys around for Dvorak layout, the home keys are attached using rotated hinges, so you end up with U, H, J, F all rotated. The keys are very slightly rectangular not square so this does lead to gaps on the sides of these keys. Be sure to follow the instructions for removal found by at skeltoac dot com when you google "apple aluminum keyboard dvorak" so you don't break your key hinges. You have to lift the back edge, not the front, and use a thin plastic shim to raise the back end up to get ahold of it. if you lift the rear right rather than direct rear of the key, it is a little easier to remove.The function keys, as on laptops, have almost all been hijacked for system functions, which really sucks. There is a fn key where help used to be which can be held to generate the real function key signal, but it's in a pretty inconvenient location there.The function key row is immediately above the top row rather than slightly above which makes it easier to hit the wrong key up there.The flat surface, not being concave, is less ergonomic since there is less consistent finger travel distances, and if you have carpal tunnel problems you'll notice cramping right away.The case is glued together and can not be opened. Cleaning it can be done by careful key removal, but the hinge mechanism is delicate enough that I suspect after a few cycles of this you'll have broken keys. Thus this may not last as long as older keyboards. On the other hand, cleaning is probably not needed as often. There is far less room for dust and lint to get under the keys -- in the old design dust just sloped down into the undercarriage and hair and such were always collecting there.

$REVIEW.: Even if you're not a gamer I'd still highly recommend this keyboard. The plastic isn't cheap or light at all. The keyboard itself actually has a little weight to it. When it comes to what it has to offer modern PC gamers, its almost quite literally packed for this price range. The rubberized keyboard is perfect for players with sweaty palms and fingers like me... It, of course, also provides excellent grip so finger sliding isn't an issue here. The palm rest is great too. It keeps my wrists/palms supported and I've experienced less knotting over long play sessions. The keyboard (without the built in stands up) seems to sort of... dip down forward. So you really can get two angles to try out. Using the stands works best for me. If you like to listen to music while you play, Perixx has you covered. To the left of the light intensity dial are [Forward/Backward], [Play/Pause] and [Stop] buttons. So far these are working perfectly for iTunes and I'd assume they work well for most media players. No more tabbing out to pause or move forward to another song! The volume buttons on the right however are mapped to the overall system audio. I don't really mind that as it's still quite handy sometimes. The function buttons are conveniently spaced in rows of 4's so they're very easy to align with hotkeys in games. Speaking more on the layout of the keyboard, the [Caps Lock] is slightly indented too to help reduce mis-hits during typing. However, I'm a very sporadic, scatter-minded gamer so every time I type to people online they tell me to calm down... On to the minor dislikes.As is to be expected, the rubberized coating will collect some dust given the proper amount of time spent unused. As is with any other keyboard, dust will gather on low traffic keys. This board seems to collect at a slightly faster rate. This mostly occurs on the outer edges of the board for me but it's nothing a quick monthly wipe down won't fix. Another thing to mention is the light. While I was pleased with the quality and colors I do wish the blue was a little brighter. You may not have the same experience. This might be because my monitor is ridiculously bright. Also, the light is dimmer closer to the right end of the board. Minor dislike and it isn't really causing me any problems as the whole keyboard is still very visible in the dark. It's not so bad that it'll throw you off if you're a little OCD. Unless of course you're VERY OCD. Finally, I wish the side lights were a little bright or perhaps a little more well accented. I really just want them to stand out more. To be honest I didn't know they were there till someone across from my desk mentioned it.It was pretty hard to pick at these cons as I am VERY pleased with the overall quality of this board.+4 Stars for quality, usability, and concept/design.-1 Star for: Minor nitpicking...+1 Star for being a High Quality Underdog brand.

$REVIEW.: I picked up two of these, one for my car and another for my wife's.  I'm using a Nexus One and she's using an HTC Aria.  I initially set out looking for a charger that delivered a full 1A, but 950mA is close enough, especially given the price set at under $6 with Amazon Prime.Build quality is very good, though I think I could do without the blue light-up disk on it.  Light-up aesthetics aside, great charger.  Also does a fine job charging my Jabra BT headset.You'll note that we're not using a single Motorola device with these chargers, and having no trouble at all.

$REVIEW.: I've had this gaming mouse for around 7 years. I bought it for around $50 through some Dell promotion if I remember correctly. I've never read a review on it. I've moved around, been through several computer upgrades and this mouse was always there. I've never had a problem with it other than dust collecting on the sensor or cords. I forgot it had weights until I found the little metal box and realized it was for my mouse. This mouse has got me through Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Planetside 1, Starcraft, Age of Empires, and many more titles. I'm still using it today while playing Planetside 2, Borderlands 2, & Skyrim.So today I was looking to find a review for this mouse to see what people may have upgraded to, and then see what they upgraded to from that (since it's been so many years) lol. Most of the reviews are old, but they all say the same thing. This mouse is great and still great after many many years. I agree, but I just figured I have to be behind the times in a gaming mouse by now and I just don't know any better because I was content with what I have.My question is do I upgrade if this mouse is still working good (as far as I can tell), or is there a real significant upgrade out there? I always kind of figured I could use more buttons, but not sure if it would feel comfortable. The middle mouse button (scroll wheel) never gets used because of the many time I try to press it, it just scrolls (switching weapons in most FPS games) before it clicks down and does what I programmed it to. I use the thumb button occasionally but it does seem a little out of reach for my thumb. I keep the DPI set to the middle, which I think is 800 DPI.  Not sure how much increasing/decreasing the DPI helps or for what situations in gaming. Anyways, from what I can tell if you have this mouse and it works, keep it. If you are looking for an upgrade from this mouse, I have no idea. I'm researching myself.I realize this mouse is no longer being sold or supported by Logitech, but why is is $175 brand new, lol.

$review_text.: This is one of the most amazing DVD players you can get these days. That is, if your TV has a DVI/HDMI port that can use it. If you don't have it, don't bother buying it because it doesn't have progressive scan, or upconversion, through the component output (YCbCr). It seems like they focused their energy on putting DVI to its best possible use, and boy, did they succeed on that count.First thing you notice when you unpack this player is how nice it looks. Design is important, especially if you plan to stack on top of it, and it's super-sturdy on top, and on the sides. When you turn it on, the front lights up like an airplane dashboard and you get to set it up.When you set it up for your TV and put in your movies, you'll notice stunning detail! If you have a 70 dollar DVD player and plan on getting this one, the difference is staggering. First off, the player not only upscales regular DVD movies which aren't HD into HD using one of the most highly praised de-interlacing algorithms (you'd swear you're looking at HD-made content), but it also eliminates jagged lines AND reduces noise, to name a few things. It does a lot more actually, but details just give people headaches. In other words, just put in a movie and see for yourself.I put in some old Stargate SG-1 season 3 episodes into it, and it reproduced them as if the Sci-Fi channel shot them yesterday and aired them on their own HD channel. I could even discern different colors on the characters' faces. The color reproduction and separation are flawless. The result of everything put together is a life-like picture that will simply blow you away. The reviews pretty much speak for themselves.There are issues though. Some people have said that there is a lip-synch problem (may or may not be easily fixable). I haven't had any problems yet, so it must depend on such factors as how you connected it to your TV and such. There is also a minor issue that the picture has a very slight black border around it, regardless of what resolution it outputs.But, rest assured, it's being worked on, and I'm sure that the upcoming firmware updates will work them both out, and then some. If there's one thing to note about this company is...they support their product. They actually listen to the consumer complaints and address them! How many companies actually do that? This will definitely help them gain a much wider consumer base.If you're looking for an up-scaling DVD player and plan on using it with a DVI connection, this device is a winner. It also comes with a DVI-D male to DVI-D male dual link cable, which is a great addition. Also, the DVI does not support HDCP, so it doesn't require a handshake with your TV to work. This solved me a LOT of problems.

$REVIEW.: The main thing I look for in an AntiVirus product is that it is JUST an antivirus product
 The average user doesn't really need anything else, and even if they did want cloud storage, firewall protection, form auto-filling, etc, they would be better using a different product for each

 When it comes to AntiVirus, I want my program to do JUST that

 I've used Kaspersky in the past, and am happy to be back with it

 Runs silently, and uses up almost no resources


 Auto-updating works fine, and it doesn't bug me with useless notifications.Windows has gotten to a point these days where anti-virus software is almost obsolete, so I want something that is quiet and effective

$review_text.: I own an itouch 2nd generation which I greatly enjoy using

However my itouch gets scratches, glares in the sun, and is sometimes hard to glide the finger across the glass screen, dampens my experience with my itouch

Using power support anti-glare film for itouch 2g has provided me exactly what I needed


A screen protector that protects from scratches, enables one to see the screen without glares from the sun, and a smooth gliding.Easy to apply, just thoroughly clean the itouch screen, then use the pre-application(the white paper) and apply it onto the screen, and remove

This removes all dust or any remaining particles that is not removed by thoroughly cleaning it
Then take out the 1 of the 2(yes 2) screen protectors, and apply it onto the itouch screen

Be careful not to touch the adhesive part of it, and be careful when you are about to place it down as it attracts to the screen
After you apply it, simply use the cloth that came with the itouch, or a lint free cloth to remove any air bubbles formed


It is to your best advantage you do not use it until one day has passed because it will allow the screen protector to fully attach it, and any remaining air bubbles you could not remove will be gone(My opinion that you should wait one day, you do not need to do this.)I have bought this on 09/23/2009, and today's date is 10/24/2009, one month and one day

The screen protector is still intact, there are no scratches still, it is still easy for me to glide my finger across, there are no air bubbles, I am still able to see the screen under the sun, and it still remains the best screen protector I have used.

So I didn't want to take any chance on my Canon 5DM3 + 70-200mm f/2.8L

In fact, it's very comfortable on my shoulder

Plus it has a little pocket where you can tuck several small items inside

The strap itself is pretty smooth, allowing the camera to slide up and down with ease


The good thing about using strap like this is that, when not in use, the camera can be swung slightly behind your back, freeing both of your hands.Overall this is a great product with excellent pricing

$REVIEW.: JLabs has produced an unusual sturdy and compact speaker addition for laptops. The sound is reasonably good, likely better than the built in speakers of most laptops. As an added bonus, the volume is louder than the laptop speakers alone.Design - ET would be perfectly happy with these speakers. They do look a little like a cross between, ET, Wall-E, and Short Circuit heads. Either you find these cute, or you hate them; I'm not sure there is a middle ground. The USB connector is standard issue. The silver flexible connector is like that in a goose neck lamp - shiny silver, and pretty much stays where you bend it. The speaker grill is silver with a chrome surround, and the rounded off body is tough white plastic.Sound - They're not bad. A bit tinny or over emphasized treble. Not much bass. And midrange is good, dialog sounds decent on these. But there is a problem - for music, these are actually very nice little speakers; running Pandora or Last.FM all day, these are just ideal while you work. But ouch, if you try to watch a movie or video, be prepared for a very strange feeling. The stereo pair are right next to eachother and off to the right or left of your screen. So all the sound appears to be coming from either off to the left or right of your screen. Nothing sounds like it is coming from the screen. There's just nothing that can be done about that. Either get used to the strange effect, or only listen to music.Construction - solidly built. These speakers have a very nice heft to them. They look like they will last a very long time travelling. The speaker head looks indestructable. The only worry I have is the weight on the USB plugs inside the laptop. Over time, this might ruin one of the USB ports, especially if you were to mash into the speaker while plugged in.These are amplified speakers - that's important to note. There is a small amplifier insde the speaker that is powered by the USB port. When plugged in, this speaker bypasses the output circuitry of your laptop - control is still through software, but no internal amplification to speaker level is used inside your laptop.Operation - tried this on several laptops. A standard sized Acer Travelmate; an Acer Aspire One; and a Dell Lattitude D630. All worked flawlessly running Windows XP. First time plugging into a computer, the computer does a little driver dance, everything required is generic windows drivers, and the speakers work immediately. Absolutely no fuss whatsoever. Control the volume with the sound control panel (the little speaker icon at the bottom of your computer screen), or with the application (like the volume slider in windows media player). Any physical volume roller you may have on the computer body will no longer function. Volume buttons on the keyboard still work like normal. The laptop speakers are muted and sound comes out of the JLabs.There is one quirk that I think may be what other reviewers have discovered but not understood. To stop using these speakers, just unplug them. If you are in the middle of watching video of some kind, that video will freeze and stop working. Simply close the video window and restart it, you will now hear audio from the internal laptop speakers. I did this many times and it never crashed my computer system.Nice, neat, well built, decent sounding portable speaker package.By the way - if your laptop is one that has say, Harman Kardon speakers, or some other brand name speaker, or is a multimedia laptop; these speakers will not be an upgrade. They are designed for the laptop with really cheap generic internal speakers. And they will be louder than those cheap built in speakers.

Like my red one, the overall look of the tan version says, `Classic,' but I thought the tan cover was a bit more 'old-fashioned' than I would personally prefer - which means I'm sure my mother in law will love it! The spine detail is also a great touch!The following is from my review of the Verso Prologue (Red) as, aside from the design, the function and fit is identical:Before actually placing my Kindle in the cover, I was wary of the heavy feel of the case and didn't expect to keep it on while reading
However, I was pleasantly surprised that the weight of the cover (and the fact that the front folds back easily) didn't make me want to remove it while reading


The added bulk actually made my entire Kindle feel more comfortable in my hands


Also, the page turning controls aren't covered in any way and reading was enjoyable.The elastic corner pieces hold my Kindle snugly and securely; I have no fear that my Kindle will slip out
It fits perfectly!I have only minor negatives of this case: One, I wish there was some type of closure mechanism, like a snap

That might detract from the look a bit, but I do worry that the front cover could fly open if dropped, and the Kindle screen could be damaged
And two, the chemical smell is a bit overwhelming out of the package


That's not unusual for many products, but the odor was quite unpleasant handling the Kindle as often as I do


The strong smell did dissipate within a week or so, but be aware that it's noticeable.Other than the lack of a closure and the initial smell, I love the cover
It's Kindle security and fashion all in one!


$SUMMARY.: Nice cover!

$review_text.: Works great! Very easy to install, doesn't create any noticeable bulge in the stock case

Worked great with the Choe Charger (B00C40OG22I got to go with it
The foil stickers that limit NFC were easy to remove, but you will need some type of cleaner to get off the residue they leave behind


I actually didn't myself and left it there to help it "stick" inside, although that's really not necessary


Really I was just lazy, lol! Haven't tested NFC yet so I cannot comment on how it behaves, but other commenters states it works with the foil removed

Through the "Galaxy Charging Current" app it states I'm getting 640mA, as well as the "CurrentWidget" (which I like better)

It does make the phone slightly warmer with this over USB as it's charging, but that's to be expected as the battery gives off more heat the faster it is charged/discharged.This is MUCH faster/better at 640mA (39.1% higher) than the 460mA I get from USB, so very happy!

$REVIEW.: I did quite a bit of research on wireless N routers.  Ratings on the RT-N56U are consistently high and it outperforms the competition (D-Link, Linksys, etc) in a number of benchmark tests performed by various websites.  So I took the plunge to update from my Linksys WRT54GL (with DD-WRT).  REALLY pleased with the upgrade!  Easy setup for wireless networks.  Wired network worked without any setup.  Separated kid's devices to be on 2.4 GHz network with time restrictions.  Put smart tv and another PC on the 5 GHz network with 24/7 access.  Used the Asus USB-N53 N adapter for the wireless PC.  It gets the full 300 Mbps connection.  I enjoy gaming and while there could be other factors at play, my server ping dropped by a whopping 25 ms.  The router was the only change in my wired configuration so I can only attribute the improvement to the router...  Wireless range is as good or better than the WRT54GL with 7 dbi high gain antennas.  Haven't run any tests to get a more detailed comparison.  However, the smart TV now loads Netflix much faster now that the connection is N instead of G.  Haven't exploited the TWO usb connections for mass storage devices or printers but I plan to.  The only thing better would be the RT-N66U which bumps bandwidth up to 450 Mbps from 300.  I've been running Linksys routers for about 15 years.  Asus just won an enthusiastic new customer.  Keep up the good work!
$SUMMARY.: Asus RT-N56U The router of choice!

$review_text.: I went for cheap "smart" and fast chargers before.  Some are really not smart at all.  Some are fast, but equally fast in killing the batteries and itself.  Some chargers cost double this and more. I don't like these prices as smart charger IC's are around for ages and very cheap.Since this charger has a display to show what's going on, and with good reviews, it just can't "pretend" to be smart, can it?  The price is good because I think it's a bit "old" in a good way.  It's a bit of a show off and self importance.  Nowadays chargers are to be transparent and out of sight.Nowadays AAA cells are replacing AA's, and C's are replaced by AA's because of power/size improvements.  Rechargeable D cells are only practical in toy cars that can carry small children. For huge amount of current amp backup, you shouldn't use rechargeable cells in the first place.  The same goes for 9V backups.  So if I can have a smaller charger for the same price, I will only need AA and AAA's.  The box itself isn't too big, but it can hold 4 D cells, still have space on top of it, under it, in front and at the back.  Part of it must be to create enough ventilation space for the batteries.The USB charger is a good thing.  Now every portable electronics are charged with USB's.  I have a standard plug to USB adaptor, a car adaptor, but one more doesn't hurt.I really don't know why the Discharge function is still there, other than that it's an old design.  Nobody sells poisonous NiCd batteries anymore and those who were brought should have been dead by now.  It doesn't do anything for the NiMH's, and wouldn't resurrect bad NiMH batteries.It's easy to put in the batteries of different sizes.  Batteries are charged independently.  Charging is fast.  Does what it claims, what else can I say?There are 4 separate battery indicators, but the status FULL, BAD etc are shared.  That means if only some of the batteries are FULL or BAD, you will see the words flickering.  You know which one is FULL but you don't know which one is BAD (which is a trivial point).To me Tenergy is a trusted brand.  I brought a bunch of rechargeable AA's many years ago from them.  All of them are still working today, though some are detected as bad, and at the time they are slightly slightly bigger than standard cells because they wouldn't fit in the Kodak charger that comes with the old camera.Bad batteries isn't really non-functional.  They are just can't be fast charged.  You can still use cheap trickle chargers to charge them overnight.  So I would like to have a voltage detector to say the battery is full, rather than attempting to charge no matter what, and then report it's bad.Of course it's much simpler to buy another batch of new good batteries.  But many of them went places with me, including trip of a lifetime in happier times, and surprisingly passed the airport security even though I have a huge batch of them for the power hunger DVD player, plus homemade combined battery holders and all the wires.

$REVIEW.: I replaced the battery on my Compaq V6310US with this one


 The size is big, pat of the battery is sticking outside the back of the laptop (for about an inch or more)


 So, you can not keep the laptop flat on any flat surface like a desk


 The keyboard/bottom portion of the laptop will be on an angle due to the battery sticking out on the back
It is understandable as to why part of the battery sticks outside the laptop
 There are 12 cells on the battery


 Other than that one minor concern, it is a good battery and performs well.

$REVIEW.: I did a lot of research before purchasing this product

Being the picky person I am when it comes to technology

I spend a lot of time learning, and surfing the internet, so I wanted to make sure I bought a monitor that not only was sharp in colors but also in text, I had bought an LG 2012 model before, but I didn't like the picture, so I returned it
As I was trying to match the LG that I have sitting next to this one


No comparison

The LG Flatron monitor L23Wtg is a wonderful monitor, and I have had it for years

Still going strong, but wanted to run dual monitors for graphic design purposes, now KEEP IN MIND THAT I ALSO HAVE A BAD ASS VIDEO CARD, so that makes a big difference as well, as I upgraded my system when I go it

So I would HIGHLY recommend this monitor
Its a beautiful monitor


Look no further

Though I bought mine at frys, I should have bought it on amazon and saved 45.00 though I thought it might be another Fedex moment, so decided to purchase it on my own..

$REVIEW.: I was toying with the liquid protectors, however, I just can't see me using those successfully. I read how others are happy with them but they are not for me. I was able to install this dry protector easily just like applying it on a phone. The fit was perfect and to my astonishment, no pesky bubbles in the middle of the screen. In fact, I don't have any bubbles at all on my Nexus 7, The tactile feel is good as well. I didn't notice any lag or missed swipes with my fingers. It's as though nothing is there and that's the way it should be. For those of you who don't want to venture into the liquid protectors I would recommend this product to you.I will be buying this one again.

$review_text.: This is probably fine for a normal alert person, but for the elderly that have vision problems and are sometimes confused and upset when they need to summon help, it is poorly designed. The place to push to sound the alert is hard for my mother to find and hard for her to push. It's only on one side and she needs to push the center.  She can not always tell which side to push or where on the correct side to push -- especially when she's upset and needs help!  It should have actual, large buttons that're reliable, well defined by touch, and easy to push, one on each side -- not a snap membrane that requires a firm push in the very center -- difficult for someone with weak hands.

$REVIEW.: I bought the 50mm f/1.8 lens was the first lens I picked up when I bought my first DSLR, the Canon XTi, back in 2006


 I was a beginner who had saved my pennies for quite some time to invest in a fancy camera

 The entry level body was all I could afford, but I had done my homework and knew that the kit lens was supposed to be a glorified paperweight

 I wanted something else instead, but I didn't have a lot of money to drop on a lens
 I read a ton of reviews and determined that this little lens was the best possible choice.I remember picking this up for about $80 and the gentleman who sold it to me called it Canon's "fantastic plastic" lens


 The build of the lens resembles that of a toy more than a piece of high-grade camera equipment


 It is VERY lightweight and the plastic body is definitely more delicate than the average Canon lens

 This makes it great for carrying around in your camera bag, but you must take some care when you have it out and about
 I've never dropped mine, but I can imagine that this lens would be destroyed if it fell on a hard surface from a height of three feet or more.It is a fixed length lens, so you're losing some of the flexibility of using a zoom lens


 In my opinion, though, prime (fixed) lenses are superior to zooms


 They tend to produce sharper photographs and I think they teach the photographer to work better with the space they have when they are composing a photograph


 I've always thought that zoom lenses make for lazy photographers, although there are obviously exceptions to that rule.I love this because of the f/1.8 wide aperture

 I was doing a lot of photography in small, dark music venues of live music performances


 Concert photography is difficult to begin with, but I was getting great shots shooting with this lens wide open with a shutter speed of 1/60

 This lens is perfect for low-light photography.It is not a completely silent lens, though, when you're enabling autofocus and the focus ring "creaks" a little bit when it is focusing

 95% of the time it isn't loud enough to bother anyone, but in a very quiet setting where the photographer is trying to be inconspicuous, this may pose a problem
 It is something to take into consideration.The only reason a photographer should not have this lens in his or her kit is if they have upgraded to the 50mm f/1.4 or the 50mm f/1.2 L


 I think a 50mm focus length is the most versatile walkaround lens available

 You'll be shocked at the color balance and the sharpness of the photographs you make, right out of the camera
 Just stunning
 Especially when you consider that this is the cheapest lens in the Canon line.For amateurs and professionals alike, this is a great choice when picking out a Canon lens.

$REVIEW.: The shape of this camera means that when you hold the small body your hand sticks out pretty far


This is meant for a camera with a larger body where your hand lays flat on the body

If it is small like the D5300 then you will find this strap is not the best fit to your hand


It will work but it is not a comfortable and secure fit around your hand while actively taking pictures
Works well when not in use to securely just hold on to the camera
I ended up putting the neck strap on one side of the camera to hold it securely in case of a drop while actively taking a picture and be able to just hold onto it in the grip when not in use


Would only really recommend for a bigger camera body where your hand lays flat..

$review_text.: Been using Windows all my life since XP. I have only owned my 27" iMac for a short time but I am thoroughly impressed with the computing experience Apple has put forth. Changing over to a different operating system has been a bit of an adjustment, small things like copy and paste require slightly different ways of execution but OSX has been easy and intuitive enough to navigate straight out the box.This iMac's screen is huge which allows a lot of space for multi-tasking. It is also stunningly beautiful. I know the gamma has been factory set so that colors are rendered true to life. Glare has been cut helping to focus on the task at hand. Opening programs happens quickly and silently. I have only heard the fan once, that during the Apple test which I conducted on my own. The only other time I've experienced completely silent computing was on my laptop. I really appreciate this feature.Web surfing using Safari with the trackpad is a great experience that Windows has no answer for. The ability to move forward and backward between pages with a few swipes to me is more intuitive and easier than with a mouse.Apps like iMovie were a prime motivation for my purchase. The PC has no equivalent for iMovie. I've been using Sony Vegas for years. Yes, I can make transparent title bars in Sony Vegas, but a greater expense of time and effort than with iMovie, which already has templates setup for easy creation. Should I decide to move up to a more sophisticated video editor, Final Cut Pro is the standard for many a video studio.Apple has made a machine that works exceptionally well and is very elegant to boot. It is a computer that inspires as well as allows for creation of beautiful content with minimal effort.*****Update*****I have had some time to use my iMac now and I'm in love with this computer. Each time I go back to my Windows 7 computer I feel like I want to kill myself because it's such an awful computing experience. I can't believe I've been using Windows for so long, now I know why Windows users are so miserable. My iMac is like experiencing a Mercedes, tasteful, smooth, elegant experience. Windows is like driving a truck, clumsy, awkward, and unrefined.*****Update 9/27/13*****My iMac is still running well, boots up in a hair over 15 seconds still, even though I've filled the hard drive up with about 500GB. The fusion drive works wonders. Parallels 8 boots up Windows very fast, within seconds. I'm learning about apps like Pixelmator to make my life easier and I have purchased Final Cut Pro. I believe I'm just starting to reap the fruits of being a Mac owner. Looking forward to making great videos, pictures, and slideshows with this workhorse. No machine has inspired me to use it like this one, well, maybe my iPhone, hehe.

$REVIEW.: It would get 4-5 stars if it they didn't advertise it as a USB 3.0 device, which is why I bought it, to quickly dump photo and video files during field recording sessions.&#34;The SuperSpeed USB 3.0 SD / MicroSD Card Reader / Writer is the perfect solution for super-speed* data and file transferring. Up to 10x faster than USB 2.0 card readers, this new device will transfer data up to 5Gbps! That's fast! Quickly download HD videos, HD photos, and documents to your computer.&#34;It installed the drivers INSTANTLY!  Less than one second to &#34;Your Device Is Installed and Ready For Use.&#34;Using a USB3.0 port (with which I have used smokin' fast USB3.0 pocket drives) it took 35 minutes to transfer 19GB (5000 files) from a Class10 32GB SDHC.That's way too slow, so I tried something. Using a USB2.0 port on the same machine it took 23 minutes to transfer those same files (into a different folder, for testing my hunch).Placing the SDHC into the machine's built-in SD reader (USB2.0) transferring those same files took 17 minutes.Need I say more?  That was a wasted effort. LFMF!

$REVIEW.: So, I have many cases for my iPad


 I look for ones that offer me features that make me want to use it


 Having said that - this one does have many plus sides depending on what features are most important to you:- It's pretty, looks stylish and quality made- My ipad 4 (new generation) fits perfectly into it and it holds it securely- The "bubble design" does allow you to slant it up or down slightly for reading and typing on it- It does provide good protection for your ipad - lots of cushioningBecause I look for features that better serve other needs, here were the downsides of it for me that also reflect it's upsides:- It's thick
 If you didn't buy in to the insurance - the cushioning may make you happy.- It really holds your iPad - I had difficulty getting it out.- The angles only go so far with the bubble - from standing straight up to just slightly further down.Bottom Line: If you're looking for a stylish, well-padded cover for your iPad for a decent value--- this is a fine buy

And, if that's all you need or use your iPad for - then it's worth the investment


 If you have other needs which have greater priority - like typing with a keyboard or something that will elevate your iPad to eye level - than I would recommend checking out theDomeo Loft Folio for iPad 2/3/4 - Brown/Tan (9293202)orBelkin YourType Folio Case with Keyboard for the New Apple iPad with Retina Display (4th Generation) & iPad 3 and iPad 2 - White Keyboard (Blue Cover)which also come in multiple colors to fit your needs.

 It looks great and sounds fantastic for an inexpensive 2.1 system
 However, there is a slight hum from the sub when no audio is playing

 It can get a bit annoying after a while so I end up just turning it off when not in use
 I love the desktop control knob - allows for instant volume control and easy on / off switching.

$REVIEW.: How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.The SanDisk SDSDB-128-A10 Secure Digital 128MB, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs.

$review_text.: We purchased this Panasonic LCD to replace a 27" Sony CRT in the spare room. The Sony served as kid's TV, backup for the grownups, and gaming monitor. It was BIG and bulky but did an okay job. Since we have a 42" Viera Plasma we decided to stick with the brand, but no plasmas came in a size small enough to fit the space in the extra room. I've become a bit of a plasma 'snob' since getting that set, but have to say that LCDs.. at least Panasonic Viera LCDs, are a great alternative.The picture is crisp.. sharper than what I see on my plasma, probably because of the lack of a glass screen cover. Although this is a 720p and not 1080p like the larger set it doesn't make much of a difference due to the smaller size of the set. It's hooked up to a Wii via component, a sony BD player via HDMI, cable via HDMI, and the PC via a DVI to HDMI wire. Using the VGA port designed for the PC connection wasn't very crisp. I was using a very long wire for the VGA and can only assume I was losing some of the signal along the way. The only drawback to this set up is only the VGA connection lets you adjust the 'PC Monitor' categories in picture set up. I have a hard time with the 32" Panny and my Nvidia graphics card getting the settings just right. But once it's set it's great. That's an Nvidia limitation, though. When using the VGA you could adjust the set like a regular monitor for your PC.. manually aligning the screen to make sure everything was straight and fit in your field of view.The specs on the set neglect to say it will handle 1080i, it does. The cable box and the BD player convert everything to 1080i, although I have to admit it's not much of (any?) a difference considering the size of the set.There's only one component input on the set and the only audio out is optical. I still rate it 5 stars but only gave 4 on the features breakdown for those slight limitations.The main thing I was worried about with the LCD was the strange motion I see on some friends' sets. I think it's the fancy motion compensation programming those sets use, though. Although the LCD can't follow action as well as the plasma, there's no weird digitized or over smoothing of the scenes on this set like others I've seen. Fast movement has that slightly noticeable refresh rate limitation, but it's nothing that takes away from the scene.Another thing I've seen panned on this set is the sound. At first I would have said the same thing.. but the default sound is not a good setting to have it on. There is a nice menu for sound set up, and once you adjust it for all the bells and whistles it sounds just fine in the little room I have it in (about 16'x16'). Like ANY TV.. you aren't going to get massive booming $1000 home theater sound without a $1000 home theater setup.

$REVIEW.: I bought a "back-lighted" keyboard because my computer is in a dimly lighted area (I don't want more light!). Usually, I have no problem with typing in the "dark" but occasionally, it helps to be able to get my fingers oriented. The keyboard arrived and I really like the additional "buttons" at the top of the keyboard that control several functions--I don't use most of them! I do use the speaker volume ones. The lighted keyboard is, dare I say it, "cool"! I don't mind the smaller spacebar, I do mind the smaller backspace key and it's proximity to the "home" key. Much of the other smaller keys are no problem for me. I like the on/off switch although I doubt that the light(s) will burn out before the switch fails from overuse! I really do like this keyboard and have had no problem getting used to it... except for the placement and small size of the "back space" key! I have to say, it gets more friendly (or I do) as far as getting used to the one dislike I have--the backspace key. I consider it a fair trade-off. Oh, the keyboard is a dream to use... very responsive and has a positive feel about it. If you are considering a lighted keyboard, get on board! An alternative is a flexible usb led light. I bought one for my laptop (with three leds) and that provided a solution. I use this lighted keyboard for my desktop. I believe this is a better choice for a desktop keyboard and it looks "cool"!

$review_text.: This is a nice TV but it has some flaws.  Unfortunately all 3D televisions sold at this time have flaws so you have to pick your battles.  I was torn between the 65 inch Panasonic Plasma or this set as both are about the same price.  A friend bought a Panasonic GT30 series and has constant issues with burn in (real burn-in, not just IR) as the newest plasmas seem to have worse issues with that than the older 2009-2010 models.  Not sure why the newer (3D) plasmas have issues with IR and burn-in like early plasmas, but I'm a gamer and I didn't want to have to worry about burn-in.  I already knew that the picture wouldn't be quite as uniform and not to expect jet blacks so I wasn't surprised when I saw some light bleed at the edges of this set on a totally black scene or some very faint clouding on perfectly uniform scenes like a white background in a commercial.  Fortunately the mura and cloudiness are quite faint and are confined to the edges so they are not nearly as bad as the Sharp Aquos 65D64U 65 inch LCD it replaced.  Here's a rundown of the pros and cons that I've found in just a few days of ownership.Pros(1) Bright, sharp, very detailed picture.(2) No one in the family had issues with seeing lines in the passive 3D picture.(3) 3D picture is fantastic.  No headaches from wearing heavy active glasses.(4) Vertical offset not really an issue at typical viewing distances, even with wall mounting.(5) Good smart TV apps, but I don't use those much.(6) Off angle (side) viewing is excellent: very little contrast/color shift.(7) Massive array of settings/features: could be a "con" too as you can get lost in them!(8) Nice sturdy base has left/right swivel.(9) Tru Motion option is incredible: can smooth out any slow-frame-rate source.Cons(1) ~150ms lag w/default settings, see [...](2) Can't use optical audio out on TV to sync sound because it only passes stereo sound.(3) Blacks are not plasma black obviously, but not bad for an LCD.(4) Some mura and light bleeding but improved by massaging screen stress points w/cloth.(5) Incredibly annoying idiot warning w/3D content: can't be disabled.(6) Glossy screen shows every reflection: reflections can ruin the 3D effect.Summary: overall I'm quite happy with this set.  The passive 3D is better than I expected and comparable to my friend's Panasonic GT30 plasma in quality.  Half-res 3D due to the passive technology doesn't seem to be a factor beyond about 8 feet.  And no one should buy an LCD expecting perfectly uniform picture and jet blacks like a plasma.  So from what I was expecting, I'm quite impressed.  This set lost one star in my review for two primary reasons: the set can't pass proper DD 5.1 sound from HDMI input to optical out, and because of the idiotic warning that pops up every time you go from 2D to 3D mode.  LG needs to add a way to acknowledge that warning once and then not display it in the future.Mike

$REVIEW.: I've seen some comments about this card not being worth the extra premium, but those users did not have a professional or pro-sumer level camera.  It is worth it to me because of two advantages over 'standard' comapct flash cards:******Upload Speed*******Upload (or Read) speeds with a USB 2.0 card reader will definitely be faster with this card.  A full card will take just a few minutes to download to my PC while my old 128 MB standard Lexar card takes LONGER to complete!  I can only imagine how much longer 512 MB would take on a regular card. Still, it may not be enough to justify the extra cost if that's your only advantage.******Write Speed******Here's the real advantage and cost justification: I have a Nikon D70 and can shoot continuously until the card is FULL.  I cannot do this with other cards I've tried.  They always fill the buffer up, and I have to wait.  If getting shots without worry of waiting to take the next one (even in sub-second waits), this is a perfect choice.  There won't be a just-missed shot because your camera and card are feverishly trying to write data.  Again, users of consumer grade cameras will not notice a big difference in write speeds, if at all.  I also have a Nikon Coolpix 995, and the difference in write speeds is completely transparent.******Conclusion******The price premium for this card is very much similar to other premium items on the market.  If you have a car that normally takes 87 Octane gas and sees no improvement with putting in 93, it isn't worth the higher price for the premium fuel.  The same goes with this card -- if your camera can take advantage of the much improved writes speeds, this is one of the best choices.  If it can't, then definitely buy the standard card and save some cash.

 When I had it removed and put my ps3 in the back of the same port it didn't work


 I tried connecting directly and on the thing itself, then I reset the settings on the tv to see if it would fix it

 Nothing worked but, my xbox 360 will hook up right, my computer will only allow me some resolutions which is very disappointing

$REVIEW.: The Belkin Cinema Leather Folio with Stand is a well-designed, well-made case for the iPad 2 and the new iPad (Spring 2012). Its price is comparable to other name-brand leather cases (I'm not including designer cases, which can cost several times the cost of this case). It is available in Blacktop/Cornerstone, Red Carpet/Gravel, and Brown/Tan.It supports Auto Wake/Sleep. Buyers should be aware that the nearly identical earlier version for the iPad 2 does not work with Auto Wake/Sleep on the new iPad. The current version is marked "For/Pour iPad 3" on the front of the box and is backward compatible with the iPad 2.The iPad is held securely in place by the four corners of a plastic frame that is stitched into the back of the case. The corner clips do not interfere with the 3M screen protector currently on my iPad. The case is equipped with a leather closure flap which is held in place by magnets when the case is closed. When the case is open, the closure can be folded all the way around to the back and also held in place by a magnet.The inside of the front cover and the folding part of back of the case are covered with a high-tack material that will hold the opened case at just about any angle in its range. It's hard to predict how the tackiness of these surfaces will hold up over time. My impression is that it will work at least until you're ready to move on to a newer model iPad. There is also a small flap on the back of the case into which you can insert the edge of the folded-back cover and place the unit upright for viewing at a fixed angle or flipped over at a good fixed angle for typing on the screen. Oddly, this feature is not documented on the packaging or on the Belkin web site. This same type of flap is found on other Belkin iPad covers.As is typical for folding iPad covers, there is no accommodation for using the iPad in portrait mode. However, the case adds only a moderate amount of weight and thickness (when the cover is folded all the way back), so the iPad can still be held in one hand in portrait mode.Just over two years ago, there were no iPads, anywhere. There may be 100 million of them by the end of this year. Any market that size is going to create its own ecosystem of add-ons and accessories. There are dozens (if not hundreds) of choices for iPad cases at price points from a few dollars to close to the cost of the iPad itself. If you are looking for a leather case and want something from a company with a well-established reputation for quality products, the Belkin Cinema Leather Folio with Stand is a good choice.
$SUMMARY.: Good choice for a leather case

$REVIEW.: I've had the opportunity to try a couple of HDTVs

 First, I bought the 37" Toshiba Regza 720p
 It was ok, but I definitely wasn't blown away like I had hoped


 Once I made the decision to go 1080p, I bought a Sony 40" W3000

 Huge step up from the Toshiba, and a definite buy if money is an object, but but once I saw how good it was, I wanted to take the final step and get the top of the line 40" XBR4
 What held me back was the price difference (an extra $500-$600)


 I kept my eyes open, and when I found a deal on the XBR4 (more later),  I pulled the trigger.Set up was extremely simple and took less than 5 minutes

 Literally took it out of the box, plugged in the power cord, connected to my satellite receiver via HDMI (a must), turned it on, and was watching tv
 I must say, that the picture quality of the XBR4 is stunning
 Like night and day with the original Toshiba, and noticably (although not dramatically) better than the W3000
 HD stations are simply awesome


 Crisp, clear, well balanced color and contrast


 SD stations are obviously not as good as HD, but still VERY good


 I am sure that I can improve even further on HD and SD quality once I do a little teaking, which I haven't had the time to do yet


 If you buy this tv, do a quick bit of research on the internet

 There are several forums where people offer tweaks that they say improves the already fantastic picture


One thing for sure....take it off the Vivid setting immediately (this is the default setting out of the box)
 Way too garish in my opinion.I have this tv in a relatively small family room, and I do not have it hooked up to a surround system (nor am I planning to)

 Sound quality from the onboard speakers is very good, and unless you intend for this tv to be the center piece of an elaborate home theater set-up (which you probably won't since its a 40" tv), you'll be perfectly happy with the sound

 I am
 Will you rattle the windows and shake the walls when you are watching a movie?  No, but if that's what you want, then go ahead and hook it up to your surround system

 There are a variety of inputs (3 HDMI, 2 component, 3 composite), so you won't have any problem connecting to your system.How about the much touted Motion Flow (120h) technology?  I'm still playing with that, but so far, I don't notice much of a difference
 When you set it to high, I do notice what others have commented on, that the picture looks almost too good (i.e


film looks like live tv, which is not necessarily a good thing)


 I have to spend a little more time looking at different content with and without the Motion Flow turned on to see what the difference really is.Looks?  I really like the glass frame that goes around the entire screen


 It is purely a matter of taste, so you have to judge that for yourself, but my girlfriend said it best ("it looks really classy").Fan noise that others mention?  Zero for my set


 I turned the volume down to a very low level, and listened carefully, but I didn't hear a peep
 Perhaps if you live in the country, with absolutely no ambient noise around you, you might notice something, or perhaps this is something that Sony has addressed in the latest builds


 Either way, I can only tell you that I didn't notice anything.Worth the extra money over other Sony Bravia models?  I have to say that the M and S models are definitely the low end models, and I think you can tell

 The V model is next in line, and its a noticable step up, and many will be happy with this line (check out the V3000, or if you want the best possible price, check out the older V2500 which can be had for close to $1000 in some places if you look hard)


 The W series is a further, noticable step up, only slightly below the XBR4 in my opinion
 For most everyone, this set would be perfectly fine, and if you can get a deal on a 40" W3000, then buy it

 You'll be happy


 And finally, the XBR series
 While it is a step up from the W series, the difference is not large
 Some might even say the difference is minimal
 In my opinion it might be worth an extra $100-$200 just for the few extra features, slightly better picture quality, and cool looking glass frame, but not worth the $500-$600 difference that most retailers are selling it for

 As I mentioned at the start of this post, I was fortunate to get a great deal
 I got Best Buy to price match an unbelievable price I found on the internet (not Amazon), and I ended up paying $50 more for the XBR4 ($1849), than the sale price of the W3000 ($1799)

For $50 more it was a no brainer, but given that the price of an XBR4 at Best Buy is $2299, I wouldn't have paid $500 more


 Even with tax, it was $55 cheaper than the price on Amazon, and I had the instant gratification of walking out of the store with the tv (sorry Amazon, but I still love you).Are there any downsides?  None that I have found yet
 It is simply an amazing tv

It is Sony's top of the line, and it shows


 Don't be sucked in by Sony's latest model, the XBR5

 As far as I can tell, and as far as every salesperson I have talked to knows, it is literally the same tv with just a different frame (which I didn't like as well as the XBR4)


 Check out the specs


 They are identical.The nutshell....if you're on budget, go ahead and get the V3000
 I think you'll be pleased


 If you have a little more money to spend, get the W3000

 It's very close to the XBR4, and you'll be very happy


 If you have the money, and want the best, get the XBR4
 You're paying mainly for a *slight* picture quality improvement, extra features like Motion Flow, and the glass frame, so its worth it only if you get a good deal and its less than $100-$200 more than the W3000

 Anything more than that is not worth it in my opion, and I've had both tvs so I speak from hands on experience.

$REVIEW.: I have NEVER been disappointed in an Apple product. Not only do they make a great product (like this Display), but they stand behind it from DAY 1 (and longer if you get Apple Care).This monitor is nothing short of amazing. I have a 27" iMac and when my 24" DELL monitor blew up the other day, I replaced it with this 27" display. When you consider that you spend the majority of your time at a computer staring at the screen, why would you stare at less than the best? There is an obscene amount of screen real estate with this display. I tend to have a lot of windows open at one time, so it's nice to be able to support them all.I'm running a 27" and 24" LED Cinema Display and a third DELL 19" LCD (only because I have some spares and the video card will support three displays - I just use it for eMail). Couldn't be happier!

Amazon took care of the return, but it was nevertheless a hassle.The replacement unit works very well. I am using it primarily to utilize the Link Aggregation (LAG) feature. I needed the Smart Switch functionality, but did not want to spend the $ and time on a managed switch. This fits the bill.Compact size with clear status lights on each port an added bonus.

$REVIEW.: If you are using all the default or basic settings from your AP/Router with WPS, this unit syncs all for you, so you don't have to know too much it just works for you, what a great unit! However it failed to mention if you are using certain custom settings or an OLD AP without WPS, you need to fine-tune settings a bit, that takes one star away.A hidden SSID is not an issue since you should know it is not broadcast, you just manually enter the ID/password, should you have the problem to get connection, you have to find out the CHANNEL! Yes, check the channel number, it has no AUTO channel setting so if your real AP channel is NOT set to 11 (default), the Extender Wifi is on, but you have NO Internet until you reset the Channel number.I also find out the IP is actually from the REAL AP/Router, not from the Extender, so even you are connecting to a "new router" (192.168.2.2), but it pulls your IP from Real AP and pass that to your devices, it is truly a "Wifi Extender", great technique for devices management for some!

$REVIEW.: I've always built my own gaming machines, but for the wife & kids, this one fits the bill perfectly

 It's very cheap, hard to build something decent yourself at this price


 Small model, saves space on the desk, which is always a plus


 Good enough hardward for browsing, casual gaming ( such as yahoo games) and light application use.As with most name brand machines, you can't do much upgrading to it, most of the parts are specifically made for them, so you can replace anything, and with the small form, you can add anything internally

 Though for most common use, the specs that's already on the machine is plenty.One common problem with all name brand machines - Junkware


 They preload a whole bunch of stuff on these machines that makes the start and overall running very slow, takes you a bit of time to go in and uninstall everything

 You can consider using norton 360 and use that to remove all the un-necessary startup programs.Wanted to take out 1/2 a star for this issue below:Keyboard & mouse, the 2pcs that comes with the machine is really poor quality, makes a 60wpm typer go 40wpm


Though it's understandable @ $399 retail price, it's hard to justify including a nice set of KB & Mouse


 Instead of including something that very few will use and makes the machine look bad, rather they just exclude it completely, only creates extra waste.

$REVIEW.: I did a lot of research looking for a good router for my house
 I had always used ethernet and avoided wifi but when I moved I didn't have the option


 I decided to invest in the AC66U (or RC66U same thing) since it had the best combination of features and specs and I wasn't disappointed.Good:- Range: I'm in a small town house but I have no range issues at all- Speed: Seems consistently strong and huge improvement of my old router- Media Server: Built in usb ports make it easy to host a media server / ftp site- Reset button: You don't have to pull the stupid power cord to restart it- Stand: Takes up less room on my counter with the standCons:- Firmware: Out of the box it worked great, a firmware update came out a week or two later and I started having issues with my wifi dropping out and my media server going offline


 I upgraded to a build by merlin (google it) and it's working great now....advice is DON'T jump on the updates as soon as they roll out, these aren't iPhone's with lots of beta testing to backup an update

 Their updates seem to break as much as they fix

$review_text.: I have nothing to compare this to, but I am using for a micro four thirds camera (Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH1) which is light weight and compact and fits my needs for a camera and 400 mm equivalent telphoto zoom combination that weighs less than two pounds (the advantage of MFT, small and light)


 I can imagine that with a full sized DSLR and telephoto may stress the whole thing, and you should get a larger and sturdier monopod.I only gave it four stars because with $300 carbon fiber monopods out there, they must be more sturdy, better constructed, more features, etc

 This monopod seems to work well for me, but I have nothing to compare it to.I like the fact that it is small and compact when collapsed, among the smaller ones that I have found...I intend to mostly use it seated, but some tall people may have an issue if they want to use it standing, and especially if they do not have a fully articulated LCD, which makes life much easier, especially during video.The monopod comes with clever springloaded 3/8 and 1/4 combination screw so you can use either size screw size depending on your needs

 Most ball heads or pan and tilt heads have a 3/8 inch screw, but some have 1/4 inch screw...see below.The ball head I happened to choose was very small and light


 It was so small that the set screw handle interfered with the base of the monopod, so I could not lock it down

 I had to get a Manfroto 3/8 to 1/4 adapter ($6.00 delivered) to lift up the ball head just about 1/2 inch...but that was my issue in choosing the particular mini ball head that I judged to be suited for micro four thirds cameras.The other nit I have is now that the ball head is installed, the monopod does not now fit the carry case, although I am still able to use the carry case by cinching the zipper over the neck of the ball head.

$review_summary.: First monopod I have owned, seems to work great.

$REVIEW.: I've been using these as speakers for my main PC for a few days now, and I've been very happy with them so far.  Easy access to bass and treble adjustments mean that it's never disruptive to my neighbours or louder than it needs to be, and the sound quality is fantastic.  I'm very happy with the easy access to a headphone port, as well as an aux input port, right on the front of the right speaker.There are a few curiosities about these speakers, though.  One of which, is that the speakers will enter their own kind of &#34;sleep mode&#34; after a small period of time with no sound coming out of them.  In order to 'wake them up', you either need to turn them off and on again, or begin playing sounds from your audio source.  It takes them a few seconds to fully activate and start playing audio.  I do wish there was some way to either defer/delay audio sent during this 'warm up' process, or some way to disable the 'sleeping' entirely, as sometimes if I am working without music for a bit for whatever reason, I can miss IMs that come in that require my attention.  I've mostly adapted to it, but it's something to be aware of.Other than this, I've been -very- happy with these so far!

$REVIEW.: Fair but not great image. Weak night vision, maybe 10 feet out in a circle about 70% of the image height.No support for Macs. You have to wire it to your router, look in the router DHCP to see what IP address it got (you can reserve an IP for future use) and then use that IP in a web browser to access the setup. That's where you configure it for your wireless network while still wired.  No motion detection by the camera--that's done by the Windows software. No audio either through the web browser. Guess that's another Windows-only thing.  I recommend Mac users steer clear of TrendNet.Works pretty well with a Synology DiskStation (DSM 4.0 here) and their Surveillance Station package after being set up with an unchanging IP address (fixed or reserved DHCP). The DiskStation does a nice job of motion-detection and records audio with the video.

$REVIEW.: After my origianl hookup, I was very impressed with this unit. However, after attempting to utilize a laptop PC via HDMI to view internet programming on a HDTV, I found that the HDMI ports did not pass any audio either to the TV or to the speakers. I tried all HDMI ports and they all did the same thing. Review of the manual to see if I was missing something revealed no additional information. Attempted on-line contact with Onkyo Customer Service resulted in no answer from Onkyo. As a result I returned the unit and purchased a Sony DH720 as a replacement which works just fine and actually sounds better with my equipment and utilizes a more advanced remote. From other posts about Onkyo products it appears they have a HDMI problem as well as a customer service problem. So far as Amazon, the initial service and return procedure was exemplary.

$REVIEW.: These subs do Not move 8 inches, that would be impossible


But, these subs are the hardest hitting ones I have ever heard

I got a dud amp, so i have these subs hooked up to a temporary amp, a 1400 watt 2 channel

Even with only 700 watts to each speaker they reproduce any freq


without any problem
I have the bass on my head unit set to -6 just so i can think straight


The clarity of these are amazing
There is no such thing as distortion
My only complaint on these are the inputs are meant for 8 guage, but just barely


I had to wire the subs at 8 ohms to keep only one wire in each input
Figured out the hard way you must put these in a VERY solid box or the subs can (and will) rip themselves through mdfUPDATE: I installed my 6000 watt Lanzar vactor

The combination is truly crazy
The subs are very tight


They are so deep it is scary

These subs hit hard at every song I've played


There is not one song where it falters on a freq

This was the first build of my life after being stuck with a Pentium 3 for the past 8 years. That's right, a PIII. Needless to say, I never really had the proper rig that could truly handle all of my games.I honestly wanted to stay with Intel after the "little PIII that could" but chose chose the AMD because although the i7 was faster, it was outrageously expensive. I can't justify $150 for such a marginal gain.Whoever says this CPU is slow is a complete idiot. This thing hauls the mail and then some. Sony Vegas, a virus scan on top of FRAPS on top of gameplay?

$REVIEW.: The iHome Smart Sleeve is, flat-out, a wonderful carrying case for gadget-lovers


It's specifically created for that person who will, at almost all times, be carrying that iPhone or HTC One, an iPad or other killer tablet, and of course a small, sleek laptop.But while the iHome Smart Sleeve might be all about the Apple brand, the fact is that this is a wonderful case for anyone who wants to care for their tablet, phone, and smaller laptop while traveling -- and to stay ultra-organized at all times, as well.The case itself is attractive and nicely designed, in functional black with a leather-like look and feel, and with a wide, padded matching black strap that is easily adjustable for the wearer's comfort


This was a nice touch, as so many bags like these seem to come with short straps, making them somewhat comical or awkward to wear comfortably
The iHome's strap adjusts even to very long lengths, which means it will suit people of all heights.My favorite thing about the iHome Smart Sleeve is that it was designed with real thought and planning

Every storage compartment is beautifully planned, with all areas for electronics plushly lined with soft faux fur, and situated for ease of placement and access

Every pocket and compartment is also labeled with a small visual of what device should go there -- from laptop to headphones to chargers to phone, etc.The iHome Smart Sleeve was created to hold three major items -- laptop, tablet, and phone

Each compartment zips open or shut, with a large compartment on one side that will hold a small laptop (up to 13 inches, although it did accommodate a 14-inch laptop I tried)


Directly behind that are two medium compartments -- on one side is a fur-lined space for your iPad, Kindle or Tablets (up to 9.7")

 On the other side of this compartment is a really cunning and neatly designed storage area for three cords and chargers, and even a little pocket for headphones and stylus.In the center layer of the iHome Smart Sleeve, there's a large central storage area that's perfect for a few folders, notebooks or other important work or organizational notes


On the outside layer is a final small, plush pocket for your iPhone, and which features a magnetic closure

I think this would fit most larger phone models -- it fit my HTC One fine, although the magnetic closure at the top wouldn't close fully over it (and its proximity to the magnets made me a bit nervous overall)

On the other outer layer is a sturdy pocket that can be unzipped at the bottom, to enable you to slip the case over your luggage handle.Overall, the iHome Smart Sleeve is a superb travel case for those with multiple high-end electronics, and I highly recommend it as a luxurious way to keep your gadgets safe while traveling.

$review_text.: Per my earlier reviews I recently upgraded to a new HDTV and a new Onkyo Receiver.The next step was to make my music library (16GB and growing) available to the receiver.Enter theWestern Digital My Book Live 3 TB Home Network Attached Storage Drive.  The price ($200) was good for the total storage, and it's DLNA compliant.The unit supports access and control/configuration via HTTP.  It shares files via CIFS and NFS.  All DLNA compliant devices on the network automatically detect the unit and can read from the shared media directories.  Transferring data from my extant network storage was relatively painless (I nfs mounted and used rsync).  It is online and works fine as a music server via DLNA to my Onkyo receiver.The only downside I have so far encountered is that I have (so far) been unable to join the unit to my NT Domain.As a media storage unit I highly recommend it.  As a generic Network Storage Device it is hard to beat at the current price point.

Now when I boot from the Snow Leopard partition, I have to waste some kilowatts because I can't put my machine to sleep or let it sleep the external drive. And, if I happen to leave the external drive running when I boot from Lion, the machine hangs because it'll try to access an external directory that's unavailable.I would send the drive back except I've spent hours setting it up and configuring it and so I'm making do with it's idiosyncracies.

$REVIEW.: QUICK SUMMARY:  I used this TP-LINK router to replace my Linksys WRT320N which began causing disruptions to my home network


 This TP-LINK router brought back the stability my home network used to have


 It was easy to setup (without a wizard program) and has a rich set of functions

 Highly recommended!Background:  Until I switched to this TP-LINK router, I was using my Linksys WRT320N for several years

 The Linksys router used to work just fine, but over the last 6 or 9 months, our home network began having stability issues

 Our Roku box no longer could stream movies (I thought my Roku box was failing)


 Then our Internet connection via DSL started dropping infrequently at first, then frequently (I thought it was my tech-savvy teenage son)


 Finally, I couldn't download music MP3 files that I bought from Amazon (I thought it was my computer)


 Turns out, something whacky happened to my Linksys WRT320N router, and all these issues went away after I switched to the TP-LINK router.WHAT I LIKE:- I could intuitively setup the TP-LINK router by using the router's firmware (the IP address is 192.168.0.1)
 Note that I am an IT professional, so I didn't want or need the install program that comes with this router.- The router has a rich feature set for creating rules that, for instance, shuts off my kids' Internet access in the evenings (but leaves my access intact 24/7)- The range was at least as good as my Linksys WRT320N, perhaps a little better (an upside to the ugly antennas that stick out from the TP-LINK router)- The router shows the uptime separately for the Internet connection and the router uptime

 I can see that my Internet connection still gets disconnected every few days (in the evenings, probably due to AT&T;)


 The router uptime has been perfect for the three weeks I've been using it
 Whereas with the Linksys I was constantly unplugging and plugging in the router to get it to reconnect to the Internet, I have had no such issues with this TP-LINK router.- The router came with the very latest firmware already installed; no upgrade to newer firmware required!WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The downside of good wireless range is this router, like many others, has the three ugly antennas sticking out of it- The router seems unnecessarily big for what it is


 I can't help but think that the engineers could have created the same router in one-half the footprint that this router has.- While I can assign static IPs to my network devices, I can't use my own label for those assignments


 One feature my Linksys router had is I could assign my own name to the static IP device


 Instead, the TP-LINK uses whatever name the device is called, and I can't override that name.- I wish it had a guest network capability, where guests in my network could be provided with a separate network key to gain access to my home network

 I dislike having to share my network key to non-family members who need to use my home network from time-to-time.NOTE:  Not every device can see the 5Ghz band


 In fact, most devices in my home can't see the 5Ghz network


 My son reports that the connection speed on the 5Ghz band is extremely quick, but that's only true when he's sitting in the same room as where we have the router installed
 The TP-LINK instructions say that the 5Ghz band doesn't have the same reach as the 2.4Ghz band.CONCLUSION:  Having a stable, reliable home network is essential for my family

 This TP-LINK restored the stability and reliability that we've been missing for a long time


 For that alone, I highly recommend this router!

It can take me a week to notice someone has adjusted the stereo in my car so that that the bass is almost entirely missing.  That having been said, I think the sound from these headphones is great.  I mostly listen to show tunes, jazz, and instrumentals, and, while I do probably turn the volume up more than I should, it certainly isn't enough to challenge these earphones.The problem that I had was that I couldn't ever seem to adjust them so that they didn't pinch my ears somehow.  I do have a large hat size, but, still... The bigger issue, though, is that the plastic "cushion" over the ears becomes very sweaty and clammy after wearing for any time at all.  So they are good for short-term use -- listening to the audio on a you-tube video without bothering an office mate, for example -- but not for longer-term listening.

My goal was to simplify the system and have them use as few remote controls as possible.I had just installed a Netgear wireless N router in their upstairs office
The signal with the Sony adapter gave 2 bars reception with the device plugged directly into the TV 3 bars with the device plugged into the USB extension outlet and the reader on top of the TV cabinet.My parents found navigating the Sony menu to get to Netflix very confusing

I found that the poor reception would cause streaming issues
I knew that my folks wanted Netflix, but would never use it if they couldn't easily figure out how it worked.I ended up installing a Roku player into a separate HDMI input
I got four bars of reception with the Roku device inside the component cabinet and noticeably faster response loading Netflix movies
My parents could easily navigate the Roku remote.The price of this device is too high for what it is, and what it delivers.

$REVIEW.: My first screen protector was the matte version of this one--huge (read: HUGE) mistake. Was like looking at the retina display through waxed paper.The crystal version is the same as what's delighted me on my 1gen iPad and iPhone. Now I remember why. :)As pointed out by other posters, applying the film in a steamy bathroom is key to success. Was a completely different experience than previous screen applications.The other HUGE key (thanks to the earlier poster for suggesting it) is to begin with the short end on the bottom--same end as the Home button--as opposed to working from the top down. If you can eyeball the Home opening and line up the bottom edge straight with the bevel, you're 3/4 of the way to success.My additional pointer would be to only peel back the bottom 1" to start, slowly rolling off the rest as you step upward. The film will more or less lay down on its own as you work your way north.Scotch tape trick? Fabulous. Works like a charm.Thanks to everyone for the great tips!

$review_text.: As others have noted, the Altec-Lansing XT1's are an excellent compromise between size and sound reproduction

The only major inadequacies are the lack of an AC or battery power option and the absence of a connection for a subwoofer


If those features are important, opt for the successor XT2 model, but be prepared to pay signficantly for them, especially in comparison to the "street price" of the XT1's


(The XT2's also provide a microphone option, but for me, at least, that's unnecessary and not a function I expect my speakers to perform.)Of course, again, as others have noted, the bass response is not what one would expect from a system with a subwoofer
But it is far better than any other speakers of this size that I've heard

And if one is looking for accurate reproduction as opposed to groundshaking vibration, they're excellent.As for "room filling" sound, my experience suggests that if it's an average hotel room, they're fine
More than that and the challenge is a bit too much; at least compared to my Cambridge Sound Works table radio and desktop system speakers
Seated at my desk in a hotel room, however, and the XT1's provide great background music for my work and in combination with the sleep timer on my laptop soothing sounds for falling asleep
(At those times, I listen mostly to smooth jazz or acoustic guitar music
Those who prefer heavy metal to drift off to dreamland may have a different opinion.)Finally, the excellent carrying case deserves a mention for those who rely on the portability of the speakers
It's both relatively rugged and well-shaped for packing in travel bag or laptop case.All in all, they're an excellent value, especially at the price recently offered by Amazon and some other on-line retailers.

$review_text.: I've had a hard time finding something I really like and something that is comfortable. I was lucky enough to get these refurbished paying a fraction of the cost brand new. In all honesty though, if I were to buy them brand new for the retail price, I would still be very happy with what I got. Very comfortable over the ear headphones, the "stretch" quality definitely helps with comfort. Very sleek looking headphones as well, they look better in person than in a picture. If you're thinking about these headphones, I highly recommend these headphones. Very good product for the price!

$REVIEW.: I bought two of these to join two RCA audio sources (only one of which plays at a time) into a single RCA input stereo set of jacks
This device worked perfectly for that application


I was a little worried that there would be a drop in volume/line signal by doing this, but I tested it and it works fine in my situation (same volume as each source directly connected to the stereo).The connection socket fit snugly to my RCA cables as well

No buzzing or static on the line after installing that I can detect.No idea if your mileage will vary, but this thing worked great for me.

If your still using a mechanical drive I would recommend getting one of these. I couldn't find a software that would make a bootable clone my drive, and Im not sure why but it just wouldn't work for me. The software on Seagate sight could not find my new Seagate drive so I purchased a separate cloning software and it didn't work either so I just did a new install of Win.7 Enterprise. I suspect there is a problem with the partitions on my mechanical drive that the cloning software doesn't like. Anyway the Seagate 600 SSD works just fine and I am very pleased with it's performance.

I did not want to spend the money on a Apple Battery considering the price of a OEM battery is almost as much as what this old laptop is worth.  It charges and the battery life is not bad.  I do have to give it a notch down because the fit was not exactly right and the color was off.

The "pen point" is a rubber button, soft enough not to damage the screen, shaped to be more accurate than your finger in tapping points on the Kindle screen.The color of this stylus is a matte silver, which is very attractive. It is very light weight. If you find that tapping the touchscreen is inaccurate (I have trouble especially getting the home icon to appear when in full screen mode) or if you don't like fingerprints on your Kindle screen, this is a very handy item to add to your Kindle accessories.

This means the case is larger than I expected, about 2 in (5 cm) x 1.7 in (4.2 cm).  Also, there's no &#34;PUSH&#34; label, so you have to guess (or know from reading these reviews) that you should press on the end of the closed case to open it.

$REVIEW.: So I got these as a gift for someone else who tends to always lose his wallet


I figured it would help him out


So far he hasn't had to use it but its been a few times where before he had this it would have come in handy


From what he has said it makes noise and the noise gets louder or more frequent the closer you are or something
So it does work apparently


He doesn't like that the wallet one is a bit thick for his wallet but well it needs to be slightly thick for battery and circuits/speaker I bet also since hes like most guys he has a wallet full of crap he doesn't need so its already pretty thick.Why does every guy have to have a George Costanza wallet? :PWell that's all from me

$review_text.: NOW I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT! Okay, worked great for the first month, a little close to two months. I really did waste money on this product! If I wanted a tablet that lasted me only a couple of months I would have spent oh... NOTHING on it. Point being, this was a real waste of my money and time. It worked great until it stopped working. It stopped registering that it was even in existence. I've got a pen with me, I'll keep it as back-up for the new tablet I'm ordering as it is a huion that has a cord and hopefully the tablet doesn't go waste side like this one did.I remember my last tablet from them and it worked great, this one though, the problem is the mini usb port.  If you're like me and you've got to tote it around, constantly unplug it and replug it the mini usb slot wears out and then it become useless and then eventually the port completely dies.

$review_text.: This camera offers a few well considered improvements over the 20D it replaces.  The sensor and processor are the same so the image quality will not differ one iota, BUT an enlarged LCD monitor, spot metering, vastly improved shutter life and ISO displayed on the viewfinder are worthy improvements easily justifying the upgrade from the 20D.  If one is considering an upgrade from the 10D my advice would be to definitely go for it.  The 20D and 30D both have the "instant on" feature and this represents a vast improvement over the 10D. The 10D was felt by many to have focusing issues and though I did not have any significant problem with my 10D in that regard the 30D represents a substantial improvement in this area. Canon still is not offering (in this price range) a camera with eye control or 45 focusing points, BUT the nine focusing points that ARE offered are well placed and the camera focuses quickly and surely resulting in tack sharp photos.The pictures this camera takes are simply beyond belief. Beautifully saturated, tack sharp, NO, and I mean NO noise at 400 or below and barely discernible noise all the way up to 1600 ISO. For all practical purposes 1600 ISO is an entirely usable speed resulting in fantastic pictures. What Canon has accomplished in reducing noise and increasing pixel density proves that they are, for now, the technology leader.  Canon for now is doing a better job at controlling noise than Nikon though Nikon with the D200 comes pretty darn close except at 800 ISO and above.The new flash system, ETTL II, available first on the 20D is a vast improvement over previous systems.  The in camera processing results in exceptional and pleasing pictures. This camera has a fixed continuous shooting rate which was not present on the 20D.  The megapixels stay constant at 8.2 million pixels.  Many may be disappointed that the MP count was not increased and feel that perhaps a nominal increase to 10MP would have better justified an upgrade.  Canon obviously feels that noise and other features are more important at this point than raw MP's and I would agree.  The holy grail of digital photography is now dynamic range.  And while this camera offers no improvement in dynamic range I think we can expect to see such improvements in future offerings from Canon and the other manufacturers.One of the greatest things about digital photography is the ability to build a digital dark room for next to nothing. With the included Photoshop Elements you are well on your way to producing pictures that you could only have imagined in the pre-digital days. I am able to recoup pictures that I never would have considered salvageable before this camera.  And while Elements is a great program and more than adequate for most needs I would recommend considering Photoshop CS2 for those who intend to plumb the depths of this hobby.Another thing I like about Canon is the lens system which IMO is second to none. Also, Canon continues to innovate at a furious pace driving the price of these digital cameras relentlessly downward.  This camera is being introduced at a lower price than either the 10D or the 20D.  The 5D is plummeting in price and is approaching my "strike point" for purchase.  I expect that we will see a sub $2000 10 MP camera with a full frame sensor in the next 18 months.  Such are the economics of digital photography.  It would seem that Moore's law is driving the prices down inexorably.So, I LOVE the 30D!  LOVE Canon. And LOVE digital. All in all I'd say I'm a pretty happy camper!
$review_summary.: IMO, STILL the best buy for the money!

$REVIEW.: After reading the reviews here, I figured I'd be fine if I just treated the WD MyBook Essential 2TB like I did the 1TB drive I bought 2 years ago:  format it, wipe all the junk off the drive, and use it as-is.  Unfortunately, that did not turn out to be the case.The first 2TB WD MyBook Essential that I purchased from my local retailer was badly built:  the drive was not lined up with the backplate, so as a result you couldn't plug anything into it, nor could you adjust the openings and fix the problem.  My older MyBook was alarmingly easy to open up, but this model's body does not appear to be capable of being opened without possibly breaking it.  When I peered down into the casing with a flashlight I saw that the hard drive appeared to have just been dumped in there, with no real frame to hold it very well:  it balances on some plastic fitttings that keep it from rattling around inside the casing.The second 2TB which I exchanged this volume for appeared to have been assembled just fine.  The ungainly power brick still caused the unit to light up, and the next step, to plug it into the machine, did nothing.  Although the setup poster doesn't actually mention that there's a power button on the back of the drive, this rather obvious solution also did nothing:  I can tell the button is supposed to cause the unit to turn on, but nothing changes, no matter how or for how long I press it.Which leads me to the website.  If you really want to see what an awful and poorly built piece of hardware this is, just go looking through the support pages.  I found solutions such as, "If the drive is not responding, be sure you installed drivers for your USB card.  USB ports will not work without drivers."  Or, "When the drive is connected to the computer, the setup software automatically runs to install the drive.  If the setup software does not automatically run, open folder X on the drive and run the setup program..." (I'm paraphrasing here).  In other words, if you don't see the drive, it's because the software didn't install itself.  So open the drive (that you don't see) and run the software (that you can't see).The manual puts this problem in its troubleshooting section, and the answer is, "go out to our website and look for Problem ID 207."  207 is apparently about how to format a hard drive in Windows XP.  It would be helpful if I could find more, but all the search results return is...the User Guide, which references the need to look up Problem ID 207 on the Western Digital Website.I called tech support.  It was two hours before close on a weekday and I spent 40 minutes on hold.  The person I finally spoke to had a bad habit of occasionally not telling me he was putting me back on hold, but when I could get his attention, we walked through the steps and the verdict was, "Take the second one back to the store - it's got a fault hard drive."  I didn't care much for the tech support, and I'm definitely not pleased to hear two different units have two different sets of physical problems--that's an extraordinarily high defect rate.I took it back.  I also gave up:  I think I'm going to just put more internal hard drives in my desktop, turn it into a server, and start backing things up there.  And as much as I love Western Digital's products, I don't think they deserve any more of my money, effort, or time.

$review_text.: Featherlight , incredibly comfortable headphones , crystal clear sound with plenty of bass and treble response are a few of the ways to describe this 5 star wireless set.A few tips....The Germans are renowned for excellent incredibly well engineered products that come with lousy operator directions.. This rig is no exception.They don't come right out and say that the little 3 position switch on the front of the transmitter( that is almost hidden)  allows selection of one of three channels and that rotating the tuning dial on the headphones allows you to 'tune in" to the selected channel.When I first used my set the sound was terrible ( the switch comes set to Channel one. When I switch to channel 2 or 3 and re-tuned the sound was crystal clear and Spectacular !WARNING...be careful when you open the compartment for the batteries. DO NOT pry it or you'll break the plastic mounting tabs. It is opened by simply rotating the foam ear pad counter-clockwise about a quarter of an inch and voila ! off it comes.The batteries MUST be charged for this unit to work properly. If you're like me , you're impatient to try the unit out and don't want to wait for batteries to charge so what you can do is just install conventional alkaline batteries and put the rechargeable batteries ( that come with the unit)in an external charger if you have one.The alkalines will get you started immediately but WARNING! Do not put the phones in the charging cradle !!!  When your done playing around, put the rechargeables  back in the headphones then you can place it in the charging cradle .One last warning... the AC power 'brick' is in a little white box"hidden" in the packaging. DO NOT throw out the packaging  until you find this device. I almost did.I read a lot of complaints about hissing and bad sound here. I believe that if all those dissatisfied folks experimented with the three channels and their tuning, their problems would go away.This is a really great headset that's guaranteed to stop screaming neighbors and wives when your watching the "Blues Brothers" trash the city of Chicago at 3 AM on your big screen. I'm luvin'em.Forgot to add.... that because this device uses RF( radio frequency)  and not IR ( infrared light)it is like a mini FM radio station that allows you to plug it in any audio source and listen to it while your out in your yard doing whatever. The range of this little jewel is over the length of a football field..Wow !!Mowing the lawn just became a rock concert.

$REVIEW.: Hi...i bought this because i was out of USB sockets for all my stuff so i figured why not get the biggest USB 3.0 PCI card i could find for a reasonable price since all technology in computers is headed for USB 3.0, and start the ball rolling......well i'm having problems with this PCI-e/Express immediately my Western Digital My Book Essential 2.0  will not work with this card, software acts crazy and will not recognize this drive in my computer disc management and also having problems with the USB 2.0 hub from this device in my device manager in Windows 7 that says device is not working and i have to keep reinstalling the drivers and whatever software is needed to keep this thing working.Anybody else having problems with Western Digital My Book Essential USB 2.0 not working with this card, or driver failure?This item is not the perfect choice for your USB 3.0 upgrade

$review_text.: I've been wanting a tablet for a long time... couldn't settle on an overpriced Ipad so I moved around different manufacturers of 10 inch tablets with Android to see how they are progressively through these past 5 months.  I returned one after another.. starting with the Asus Transformer Prime, the 300, and now the Samsung Tab2 (for about 2 months now).  Still .. one problem after another ... software upadates .. Version 4.0.3.  Tonight/this morning .. the screen froze while I was typing an email in Gmail.... couldn't make the tablet "budge"; can't reboot, shut off power,etc.... looked online with my desktop and rebooted it with "power switch" and volume (up) button pressed at the same time.  Finally booted ... otherwise, let the battery run out and charge again.Anyways .. besides other things, this made me return it to the retail outlet.  I bought it at Costcos .. 3 months return policy.  I'm going for it.. the retailer may hate me for it, but I'm within my return policy legal rights.  I can't handle this Android problem anymore.. let me list them:Asus:1- reboots once in a while by itself ... finally software upgrade.. and Asus customer service states: "... we're not aware of any problem with our tablets...".  This is their official customer service script for all customers calling in about problems.  Too bad if your return date has passed.2 - edge of display had a lot of video jitters.Samsung Galaxy 10.1 Tab 2:1-  auto correcting typing software ... hideously flawed and so so so annoying.  It's trying to correct what I write.. sometimes too much so... and can't get out of it.2 - YouTube freezes quite often ... and can't play videos ... have to reboot before playing ..  This happens all sure enough times.3 - Typing email, software/virtual keyboard  shows cursor but appearances seem to be off alignment, and characters can't delete.4 - Tablet completely froze, nothing worked except the screen stayed "on" with what application I was on.  Can't shutdown manually, touchscreen didn't do anything.  Had to reboot with power/volume button depressed simultaneously.5 - Too many application errors .. mainly YouTube...6 - Version of Tablet softare: 4.0.3.I can't handle it anymore .. maybe it's time for an Ipad .. but I don't want to pay for the pricey one.I'm returning this to Costcos TODAY!  I will have to reset the tablet to erase any "auto fill" info.Android is not ready for Prime Time... I've been so wanting a tablet for so long but I can't handle this anymore... and I need an at least 10 inch screen.I'm a software engineer ... boy .. could I work for a good company now ...

$review_text.: I found the Card Super easy to install, and super easy to configure.The test items in the software make sure for a superb audio experience.I was using a TURTLE BEACH card, and its hideous

I would not give the "Turkey" Beach card away, but I am keeping it for my own workshop, since I have a home network where I repair PCs.About the only issue thus far has been the lack of DTS  access.But, I am sure I will get this solved; the Audio quality has worked superbly with my Altec Lansing 5.1 system, and the sound is beyond awesome.I have never had any significant problem with a Sound Blaster card, and the extras with this card are great


LARA CROFT alone justifies the buy !!!If you love great sound, want to do some home recording, then this item, with its additional MIDI port for home studio input will be just a dream setup.Admittedly a MAC G3  or above is a better move for a home studio, but this card is so superb, and very cool, you cannot do better for the price.

$review_text.: I buy everything I review. To receive FIVE stars, a product must meet >90% of the manufacturer's claims. I don't subtract because I don' t like the color or appearance (too subjective and personal). I review form, function, ease of use, and construction quality. Please forgive typos: I'm an evidence-based scientist, NOT a typist. If you find my review helpful, please click "YES". This helps me improve future evaluations (which I do for free to help people make more informed decisions).Their Claim:  Extend your wifi network to dead zonesMy Verdict (details below):  True, but takes workI don't have WPS (which the instructions say takes just the click of a button to set up once plugged into the wall), but rather WPA-2 personal network. So, to set it up, you have to1. plug the module into a wall outlet near your computer2. connect it via an ethernet port to the COMPUTER, and NOT the router/modem3. disconnect your computer from the internet by unplugging the ethernet cord (which if it's hard wired, you just did when you unplugged it from the model to access the ethernet port) and turning OFF wifi5. go to the website specified in the QUICK START MANUAL4. follow the on-screen instructionsI did exactly as told. It took about 10 minutes, then I saved the settings so I could load them back in case it got messed up during a power outrage or whatever.I then unhooked everything, hooked my computer back to the modem, took the module and plugged it in to a first floor outlet, near the dead zone. The lights went from amber to green, indicating it had found my wifi network and was ready to go. I then went to my wife's computer, which always got one bar, and believe it or not, it now had FIVE bars. I selected the network, which NETGEAR named for me ZNY_extended (although you can name it anything you want during the setup process; I just used the default), hit CONNECT, entered my WPA-2 password, and I was surfing the net at lightning speed.What had been a dead zone was alive and kicking.But here's the issue. If you do NOT feel comfortable and understand how to plug into an ethernet port, or are afraid of computers, this isn't going work. Extending a network easily and quickly is YEARS away from happening. This took some work, and I'm computer savvy. What took me 10 minutes could easily take my wife 1 hour, if she would even attempt it, which she wouldn't. If you're a computer DIY'er, then this model works. If you are not, this won't work for you. It's not plug-n-play by any means.I'm glad I got it. Extending the range of my network is a real benefit to me. I may get another for my basement.

$REVIEW.: Just want to say that I think that Garcia Ricardo review is a fake as I saw it copied and pasted a few other places (Newegg) for the same product.  Not sure if its the company or what.Anyway, installed these cards on a new Win 8 64-bit OS and all I had to do was go through Device Manager and on the question marked item I told it to browse for drivers and pointed them to the ones I downloaded off Rosewills site.  At the time of this writing their installer would not work on Windows 8 but the drivers do with the manual process I mentioned.It installs as LPT3 as I noticed on the two computers I installed two of these cards in.  Again, in device manager you can change which LPT it uses.  So, it worked good and shipping from Amazon was good.  No complaints from me.  Would order these again.
$SUMMARY.: Windows 8 64 bit with no trouble

$review_text.: I just wanted to confirm Steven G Neubeck's review. I am on my second set of 641s, after having returned the first set under warranty. I am now told by Altec that the 641 is discontinued, so if I turned my second set, I would receive a lesser quality set of speakers. If memory serves, I believe they said I would receive 5100s.Here's the beef. The speakers are great, but in my case, the subwoofer on both sets has died after about 5-6 months use. Since I do not plan to return my second set, I decided to see if I could fix the sub, and discovered the source of the problem.First, I noticed that if I left the speakers unplugged for an extended period of time - not just turned off but unplugged - the subwoofer would start to work again after I turned it back on. A light bulb lit up somewhere over my head, and I suspected there was a heat issue. After plugging it back in it would work for a while, then quickly begin to stutter, until finally it stopped producing bass again.The satellites have never been a problem.So I took the sub apart. Disclaimer: I do not recommend this to anyone, as there is nothing inside that can be removed, as the box is actually very well made with everything sealed in place with very strong heat-glue. To remove any of the internal components would involve melting the glue, which is quite impractical. It will not unstick just by prying either, as that will simply break the plastic part that the glue is holding. Trust me.After failing to extricate anything from the sub, I peered inside with my flashlight to see what I could see. There are two visible circuit boards one on top of the other, and one heatsink mounted perpindicular to the top board. At the far end of the bottom board, I noticed some molex style plugs. They were very inaccessble being at the very center of the sub, behind the speaker inputs, and various other circuitry. But I could plainly see that the plugs were MELTED. So, I did what any experienced computer builder would do, and left the rear panel off. Apparently, the sub was not getting enough cooling, and as long as it stays cool, it works, melted plugs and all. I now have it plugged into a switched outlet, so I can completely disconnect the power after I am done using it.Warning: Should you attempt the same remedy, be concious of the power connector leads on the inside bottom of the rear panel. They are exposed, potentially creating an electrocution/fire hazard.

$REVIEW.: I used to use Wave Pro which contained MX 1100. I liked the mouse wheel, but I hated the keyboard. So I sold it.Now,  since Logitech is the only company that sells microgear wheel mouse, I had no choice but to buy a Logitech mouse. Of course I read the product page on the Logitech web site. The description was vague about the mouse wheel. It said super precise fast wheel, so I thought it was a microgear mouse. It was NOT. Slow scroll was OK, but when I scrolled it fast, it kind of made scratching noise which was unpleasant. It could not scroll much. (Probably 10% of MX 1100 with the same maximum one swipe down) I made one of my colleagues try it, and he also said he did not like the wheel.And there was no driver for Mac. I tried the web site, and it was not. The product box lists Mac as a supported OS, but no driver. Of course you can use a mouse without a driver, but only the basic features. You cannot use backward/forward buttons on Mac.Other than that, I do not find anything to complain about tracking. Probably average. The mouse is a little bit heavy though.I live in South Korea, so I bought one from a Korean reseller, but I thought it would benefit potential buyers if I write a review here.

it fits my transformer infiniti good enough

the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because the button to seperate the tablet portion of the case with the closeable stand portion comes loose a little to easy sometimes & the tablet portions velcro could use being just about 1/8 inch tighter

besides that its everything one could need seeing as i have a laptop bag i keep my tablet in.

$REVIEW.: I bought this hopeful that it would answer all of my fine tipped stylus prayers. I was wrong. There is a clear disc that you place on the screen of your device. I was hopeful that it would come off, but it doesn't and it's kind of annoying when dust gets under it and you can hear it scraping while writing in a meeting.  It also breaks extremely easy. You also have to unscrew the pen in the middle and then rescrew it together to make it an appropriate size. When recapping in a hurry, it is easy to break the clear disc tip off. The stylus still skips letters when you are writing fast and it doesn't make things much more legible. It is not like writing with a pen. I suggest saving the money and buying an external keyboard for your device.

$REVIEW.: After having my Maxtor give me the 'click-click' of death, I swore of that brand and delved into Western Digital largely on the fact that my Dell has a WD internal drive, and their much publicized quality issues seem to be behind them.It's only been 3 or 4 months but the drive is fine.  It works, is as fast (or slow) as advertised.Here are the negatives:* At install my computer recognized the hardware, but couldn't assign it a drive letter.  I had to right click on my computer, go to MANAGE, and then Disk Management and manually assign a drive letter.  That's pathetic in this day and age of plug and play.  It took me about 45 minutes to figure this out, all for no good reason.*  Dantz Retrospective.  Somehow this company has cornered the market as the software for external hard drives.  And its LOUSY!  To describe it as poor would do a dis-service to poor things that work, but not well.  Dantz will backup your drive, but to get it scheduled is incredibly tough and time consuming.  Also it will not just back up your hard drive, but rather puts all the files into "catalogs" which are logical representations (of several gig sized) of your data.  I believe it will work right -- but you can't verify this.  (As opposed to having a file structure like your C:\ Drive, all you see is "Catalog 01" and you have NO idea what is inside -- you are trusting that it the software worked and your data is in there in case you need to restore.  These have been issues with Dantz for years and they have yet to address it.  Any hardware that has DANTZ is automatically docked several points.  No software would be better -- as I manage my backups by hand.In summation:  Good drive, sloppy setup, horrible software. (But still much, much better than MAXTOR -- do NOT buy a Maxtor even if its free).

First it had only one previous review so I didn't have much to go on

I tested the zoom, scenery settings, and flash and found all lacking
Very fuzzy pictures even without the zoom and long lags between photos


I'm sorry for the lack of technical verbiage, but hope this is helpful


I ended up trading to the Canon PowerShot SX160, which while not a DSLR camera, is a better point & shoot for me

It is much heftier (this Nikon was too small for my hands), much shorter lag time, and provides higher quality shots on just the auto settings.

I should add that I run this drive 24/7 and my laptop gets warmer then the drive/enclosure does
Please note I said warm not hot.The only issue I did have was not associated with the enlosure


 I pulled the 2Tb drive out of a Windows XP machine I had and the drive was jumpered to be used with XP


Long story short, Windows 7 would not see the drive but Linux would


Backed up the data, pulled the jumper, reformatted and drive now works like a champ.All in all I love this enclosure, straight forward installation, Linux and Windows 7 recognize it without the included drivers

I have recommended this enclosure to friends.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this TV from Best Buy about two months ago and it is one of the best purchases I made.  Before this set, I had purchased a 47" LG 1080p LCD earlier in the year.  I was happy for the most part with that set but the blacks were not good at all compared to my 57" Hitachi Rear Projection CRT I had before it.  That set was 1080i max and I was disappointed that Blu-Rays didn't look a whole lot better in 1080p on my LG.  I've been hearing the old Plasma vs LCD argument for a while now, so I decided it was time for me to see what the big fuss about Plasma was.Let me get one thing straight, "600hz" is a marketing ploy.  I originally bought this set because I has thinking the 600hz was comparable to 120hz and 240hz LCD sets for making Blu-Rays looking extremely smooth in 24f mode.  This is a 60hz set.  Even if, the default picture was much smoother than my LG which was also a 60hz set.  There is also a way to make this TV a higher end model via the service menu.  I will not say how to do it, but let's just say that I am now able to take advantage of the Cinema Smooth feature at 48hz that gives you the same smooth picture found on 120hz/240hz sets for Blu-Rays in 24f mode.The picture quality on this set is excellent.  I have tested Blu-Rays, unconverted DVDs,HD cable, Xbox 360, PS3, Wii and my PC on this set and they all look excellent.  I do recommend playing with  your video settings a bit, because out the box the picture is pretty much on torch mode. At first, you will get burn retention on the set.  That's what happens when you leave a static image on the screen for a while.  It's going to be a little bad when you first get the set but it is not permanent and after the break in period(about 100-200 hours) is becomes less and less.  There is a Screen Burn Protection mode that allows you to use a bar scrolling mode that will take away any image retention you may be within a few minutes.  I recommend using it on a regular basis during the break in period.  The only other negative I would give this set is the screen glaring issues that many Plasmas face.  I don't have my set under direct sunlight, so it's not a big issue for me but if you have a window directing facing the set I can see it being an issue.  If you put this TV in a dark room and you will not be disappointed.All in all, this TV has a couple of minor problems but overall the positives completely outweigh the negatives.  The blacks look great.  The colors are bold and pop out.  The motion is smooth as butter.  It's also nice for a TV this price range having 4 HDMI inputs and a VGA input(which a similarly priced Panasonic lacked 1 HDMI input and didn't have VGA at all)  I love this TV and for the price range, Plasma >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>LCD.
$SUMMARY.: This is an excellent set for the price.

$review_text.: I'm not an audiophile, I'm not a gamer... I am however, someone who appreciates comfort, clarity, and ok some bass in her headphones. I usually use earphones for a couple hours a day, an hour on the exercise bike and/or treadmill and if I want to watch a show on my laptop or listen to music while going online in the evening when my husband might also be in the same room watching something on tv that I don't want to listen to.After losing my last set of really nice earbuds (which if I'm being honest with myself I sort of hated wearing, they weren't comfortable, but were great audio quality and expensive so I kept using them) I decided to be cheap and attempt to just use a pair of $25 Sennheiser headphones we had laying around. Sure they worked.... however I had the same issue I had with the earbuds cord while exercising, in that it was forever getting in my way or bothering me if I picked up the pace on the treadmill and worse was that they didn't cancel out the noise of my husbands sports when I was trying to watch a movie or listen to music unless I turned up the volume past a comfortable level... it was time for a change.I was a bit concerned about fit and comfort, it seems like most nicer headphones are designed for me, and I get that... most users are likely adult men... who apparently have a bigger head than I do &lt;wink> These work for me, yes I wish they were a bit smaller or adjustable (they slide around a bit, but not off, when I jog on the treadmill) but they aren't heavy, are padded nicely, and are comfortable... however if you have a small head you might want to see if you can find a pair to try on before ordering to make sure they will work for you.Sound wise they are great, nice and clear... no distortion. Good bass. They beat the socks off my $25 pair, though for 10x the cost they better and in truth if I didn't need to drown out the noise of my treadmill or husbands shows I might not really think the price difference was worth it, but being wireless pushes me over the edge that they are definitely a worthy investment. Not having to deal with wires while working out anymore... ahhh... bliss. They are very well padded so my ears do get a bit sweaty, but it's not awful.I've paired them with my macbookpro, kindle fire hdx, and iphone 5 and all paired quickly and easily and I've had no connection issues. My husband attempted to pair them with his ps3 to test out and while they connected he wasn't able to use them with Grand Theft Auto V (though reading online it sounds like the game might not support headphone use and frankly I didn't want him trying to steal them from me so I didn't let him mess around with them for long).No complaints at all!

$review_text.: So, my backstory- I ruined no less than 3 (three) Apple wireless keyboards... all were sodas, and it was in the space of a year.  Not very good averages for me!I purchased this out of frustration with my own &#34;clutziness&#34;.  Well, after having this for 6 months, I've yet to spill another soda... go figure!Pros- Fits VERY well.  My wife didn't even know I had it on for the first week.  It was only after my 1 year old daughter pinched it off in her fingers that she said &#34;What on earth is that?&#34;.  It is that transparent and clings well!Protection- After not having a spill, I took this to the sink and ran water over it with my hand under it.  Perfect!Fit- This protector clings to the keys, and you wouldn't think it would grip, but it does!  Apple keys have a very shallow depth, so this protector had to be made with precision.Feel- Honestly, this is going to feel very different, if you've never used one.  The keys won't have their usual &#34;click&#34; or give.  It is muted or dampened.  My wife didn't like to type on it, but I think it's just fine, and I got tired of buying $60 keyboards every few months.  If you decide you only want to use it when eating or drinking, you could do that to.5 stars for a perfect fit over the keys and for protection.  Feels different and will take some getting used to... can't fault the product for this.

$review_text.: Amazon rating of 4 stars stands for "I like it" (not "it's perfect")Latest addition to Lenovo's Z570 line and performance is great for being the lowest powered CPU in the line, no problems found unless you are used to a much faster machine already, then I suggest you spend just a bit more on the i7 version of this Ideapad.  The Z570 is available with i3 , i5 & i7 CPUs  4 core to 8 coreMany nice features for the price.  This model does support WiDi so you can use wireless transmitter accessory to see your content on a TV screen in large size without cable attached etc.Z570 DAU version uses the Intel HD Graphics 3000 in processor video/graphics so is limited in resolution to 1366 x 768Love the fact that they covered high wear areas with brushed annodized aluminum rather than just paint the plastic case.  Painted notebooks wear through sooner or later and look a mess at some point.The Z570 looks more brown than grey to me, but I find that it looks even better than the advertised gun metal grey would be.I've run this through three full discharge and recharge cycles now and found nothing to complain about for it's price range.Only item I find off spec is the run time on battery power, I'm seeing no more than about 3 hours per charge at best so far, but that is actually using the laptop not just trying to get longest time out of a charge.Not sure why the run times are not up to listed specs unless the listed specs are padded some... like timed with as much turned off as possible and screen brightness down to lowest without running the DVD or HDD etc.Normally I don't care for the keyboards on laptops, but this one feels as good if not better than the one I use with my desktop PC, although you do have to get used to different layout of any laptop.This Z570 has several buttons off the keyboard to operate the system settings that are very simple to use and require no real thought to use as they have on screen selection icons when you press them... easy to select and set your computer for intended use each time, as in  'Movie' 'Music' 'Photos' using the 'OneKey Theater' button so that everything is geared to that activity, or just leave it in the 'Intelligent' mode and it will decide based on the software running.Another, the 'Thermal management' controls the various cooling modes of the Z570, including a dust cleaning setting that pulses the fan to help keep the cooling area clean... pretty slick.The 65 watt AC adapter/charger (120-240 volt input) has a reach of 9.5 feet which should be good for most people... Speaking of the AC adapter, I see replacements from Lenovo are quite reasonable to buy, unlike some brands that overcharge for such things.  6 cell battery pack is affordable as well.I ran the on board "EE" boot optimizer and the Windows 7 boot up time dropped to 24-33 seconds.  Shut down times are also very rapid.A couple of things have been dropped from this Z570 DAU model (to keep the price down?)... and that I wish it had, are BlueTooth & USB 3.0 since both are now in use for some time to come.Also a small item is that the lid does not have a catch and stays closed only by spring loaded hinges.  If you carry the Ideapad like a book at your side, the lid wants to click open and closed a bit as you squeeze you hand to hold it.  Not a deal breaker, but note worthy I believe since it makes and noise and could wear parts.If you are ready to buy a Lenovo laptop, be sure to check out the various other models available from them before you order, features are added and removed for very little money difference it seems.  "Z" line has 4 models alone and there are several other model lines to pick from as well.  Check 'em out....As of now, this Z570 DAU is still not listed on the Lenovo web site to compare side by side for some reason, but three other versions are there.I do have a Lenovo 24 inch monitor for my desktop PC and it has been a quality item, working well for a couple years now.  Gave me previous respect for Lenovo products.Update;The limited viewing angle of this screen is a bit troubling and you must have the vertical and horizontal "tilt" just so, in order to see true colors and details.  Pretty much needs to be dead on to your eyes.  Screen surface is very reflective as well adding to the problem.  Short run time is getting annoying also.Update 10/06/2012FYI note;  This Lenovo model is no longer listed at the Lenovo web site and seems to be out of production already.  Current version (improved) looks like the ~ IdeaPad Z580 Laptop - 1024D9U  including very low upgrade price to Windows 8 if purchased June 2, 2012 though January 31, 2013Update 12/24/2013First problem encountered.  On screen icon says battery is at 94% charge but Z570 will only run on AC power...  will not start up on battery and will go to black if power cord is unplugged while turned on.  Have always had it set on "balanced" for charging so it would treat the battery pack better.  Will keep looking for the solution but believe the battery pack is bad after less than two years service and careful use.

$REVIEW.: Whether or not this device works for you will depend largely on your use of it.I do a lot of conference calls on my blackberry

The blackberry speaker and mic are good but not great, so I figured this would be a nice improvement
Since it's bluetooth, I also don;t have to deal with wires, and it becomes portable if I want to move from the car to my house of vice-versa
The bluetooth part works great, it pairs very easily and I've had no problem with that
The sound is good too, both for spoken voice and for music
The problem is the mic

As soon as I started talking people starting saying "huh? what? we can't hear you!" even in the noise-free environment of my home office

The small mic on my blackberry was far better than this speakerphone.So there you have it, and it all depends on your use
If you're mostly listening to music or podcasts in the car, then this is great
If you need to use it as a phone too, then you might want to look for something else.

$REVIEW.: Recently I upgraded the bedroom TV from a Sharp 32 inch 720p HDTV to a Sony 32 inch 1080p 3D HDTV (KDL32EX720)


 As part of this home entertainment improvement, I added a pair of headphones (the Sharp didn't have an output for headphones)


 These have been a really wonderful pair thus far (from mid April to mid June).Everyone in the family finds them useful, comfortable, and actively wears them for all types of TV viewing

 My partner and I use them for TV watching, while the other sleeps
 Our Son uses them when he comes in to play on the Sony PS3 attached to the system

 They are good for gaming, watching movies (Blu Ray, DVD, OnDemand), over the air TV shows, cable TV shoes, etc.As Tim Shucks says in his review "I am not an audiophile."  Like him my hearing has issues (in my case from a childhood illness) in a specific range that covers part of human conversation


 There are times when even with the volume turned up to maximum on the headset, I still have a hard time hearing or can't hear at all what someone said
 I do wish Sony had put in a slightly more powerful speaker system, but they still are really great headphones for everyday use
 I find them comfortable whether I'm sitting up or laying down
 I also love the various power saving features.As for range, I haven't found a limit yet


 I can go outside, to another apartment, etc


 They have a longer range than my two wireless routers!I'm giving these headphone a 4.5 out of 5 stars, because they aren't as powerful as I need / would like to see them (for my use)
 I'm happy with them and would buy them over again, if I had it to do over again.I will admit, I'm now in the market for wireless headphones for my workstation


 I thought about another pair of these headphones, but decided against it because of the under powered speakers, yet, if I can't find anything better 


I'll be back for my second pair and for me that is the highest rating I can give -- I'd buy them again and own more than two of them.

$REVIEW.: The Iomega StorCenter ix2-200 arrived on time and with safe and well designed  packaging.  This unit was purchased as a replacement for  a failed 3 year old Lacie NAS unit on a home network serving 4 devices:  a Win 7-64 desktop, a laptop with a win 8  preview OS, a win 7 theatre PC, and an Android tablet. Based upon online reviews,  the ix2 won my purchase on a conservative budget.  Having started my tech career in the mid 80's,  I have a tendency to be impatient with software install guides.  This time, with more than a few reviews citing install issues,  and  out of curiosity,  I decided to follow Iomega's setup guide by the numbers.SETUP WORKEDI read: attach a LAN cable between the ix2  and the primary network router, turn on the ix2, download and install the most recent manager software,  input answer's to a few questions, do a restart.  And---- the ix2  did as advertised. It showed up  on the primary Win 7 desktop directory and also on the other  3 network devices with no other input required.  This in all about 10 minutes: not counting reading time. No  troubleshooting fun needed.HARDWARE ISSUESThis ix2 is setup is in a downstairs workshop. The unit does run warm to the touch but not hot as some reviewers have described for  their same unit . My unit also makes faint knocking type sounds heard from 6 or 7 feet when accessing data and a slight humming noise audible to about 4 or 5 feet in my quiet work shop. This is not all that noticeable in  the shop but  possibly to probably  it would be an unwanted nuisance in a quiet room or if located close by in your work space. This unit  runs 24/7 and so far I have no complaints about the speed of transfers or the hardware build. Oddly, the hum has become more quiet and the knocks softer. The unit has also become a bit cooler to the touch.  These changes occurred over a period of  5 to 6 weeks.SOFTWARE ISSUESI did run into problems with the Quik Protect software setup. This software is supposed to guide you by hand, so to speak, on selecting which folders and files you want backed up and on the frequency and time schedule  you want.  The problem I had was partly my own doing. I made an error when entering my ix2's network password in Quik Protect's setup. Because of this error, Quik would not respond when clicking on "finish" and It did not  produce an error message telling me what the problem was despite re-entering the setup information 3 times.Embarking on a C: Drive search for Quik Protect's any error reports revealed, in an ever so buried "Quik Protect log file",  I found "not able to execute application".  No help there or with Iomega's online chat or their employee online run forum either. This does generate some questions about Iomega's software testing and support commitments. Thru trial and error I discovered  my input error  and completed the "Quik Protect" setup.  After trying out "Quik Protect", I decided its options were too basic and inflexible for  what I needed and, in addition, this app nags and makes an unneeded nuisance of itself on every startup for which Iomega did not have either a solution or work around.ALTERNATIVESIn Quik Protect's  place I used a 10 year friend: "Argentaum Backup". It's a low cost marvel of simplicity and configures to your liking. It has been absolutely reliable and works fine with the ix2. There is no reason that other backup software would not work just as well.For a small home or small home business, I am todate satisfied that this drive unit and Iomega's  management software. It easily handles backing up and guarding  my personal and business data and I plan to keep it.  If I wanted an over-the-top secure network NAS that also provided  tracking of users  and data use,  the iX2 would serve the purpose by replacing Iomega's management software with something more sophisticated  like "FreeNas" or the like.SummaryIt would be easy to do worse for a NAS backup.

There is a trick to bluetooth linking with a mac, but once I got past that it works good.The one downside I have is that the mic is very quiet with no way to turn it up.  I have boosted the mic input on the computer as much as it will go and it is very hard for others to hear during VOIP calls.  I am now using it as a recording headset where I can boost the audio after it has been recorded.Just understand that the whole thing works very well, just horrible mic gain.

$REVIEW.: The tube works well with my D3200 and a low-end 55-200mm lens
Feels solid and overall the quality seems good
Image quality is not affected


However, there is some light reduction when you use the tube and camera shake is more noticeable with the magnification, so you'll have to correct for those things by finding ways to increase light and/of keep the camera steady

Focusing with a low aperture can also be tricky since the depth of field is so pronounced


I would recommend you try to focus manually (although with this tube your camera should be able to focus automatically

It did so for me, although the lens definitely seems to have a more difficult time doing so

One thin I would improve is that the metal release levers you see pictured on the side of the tube are fairly loose


It doesn't affect performance, but they kind of rattle if you shake the tube around


If you want to see an image I recently took with the tube, go here:[...]

$REVIEW.: I was in the market for a home-grade 4+ bay NAS that wasn't rack mounted. After about a month of researching and reading reviews on various NAS, I finally settled on this unit.Setup was easy, if a bit time-consuming. Being one of the &#34;cheaper&#34; models, the drives are not hot swap, so you need to take the cover off, remove a drive tray, screw the drive to the drive tray, put the drive tray back in, and then screw the drive tray to the chassis. Repeat for the number of drives you've put in (in my case, four). Not difficult.Once you've got everything up and running, you follow the directions on the &#34;quick start&#34; sheet to set up the unit. This doesn't take very long, and within a few minutes (I think less than 30 minutes total for me), your NAS is up and running.

$review_text.: I have ordered solar radios in the past and this is much improved. I was surprised it was so small, but it feels like it's well made and it works great. I've been using the solar and crank, and it always works. It's comforting to know that if the electricity goes out this winter I can listen to my solar/crank radio to find out why I'm going to freeze to death. I've also used the flashlight and it does give off enough light to find my way around my yard at night. I really like it and am considering buying another one for the car.

$review_text.: I have HD movies on my media server which is accessed by several media players
 These players include wi-fi computers and non wi-fi devices, such as WD Live plus

 I have 2 HDTVs that utilize the Live plus

 The WD Live plus works great when hooked up directly to the router, but I had to move the router away from the HDTV's
 This changed forced me to try to use Wi-Fi adapters (D-link DWA-131) and even a Bridge (D-link DAP-1522) with the WD Live plus

 Non HD files played well but HD files were choppy


 After seeing Dong Ngo's review on CNET TV, I tried the WD Livewire Powerlive Kit.IT WORKS GREAT! It was easy to set up.NOTE: This device's transfer rate is maximized if your Router is a Gigabit Router and your server is hooked up to that Gigabit router (i.e
D-link DIR-655 or 665)


 Many routers have only 10/100 Mbps LAN, which you have to connect the Livewire "home" unit to
 The max transfer rate on the Livewire is double at 200 Mbps


 I have tried both types of routers

 It will play most 720 p HD movie flies well, but on occasion there will one that is choppy


 It will not play 1080 p HD flies if you do not have a gigabit router.[...]

$SUMMARY.: Streams 720 p and 1080 p great

$REVIEW.: This is an average set of headphones for the dollars you'll spend on it. Decent sound, decent noise isolation, overall pretty good. If you are considering replacing your stock headphones that came with your iPhone with these, then this would definitely be a good decision. They sound 1,000x better than the cheap headphones that Apple packs in to their devices, especially when it comes to bass response. The original size plugs that came with the headphones did not fit in my ears, but fortunately Plantronics bundled two other sizes that you can easily attach. You want a slightly snug fit, otherwise the sound quality and the noise isolation both suffer.

$REVIEW.: This is a nice cover that fits well and does the auto-wake/sleep very well. It's also a nice color (though not as nice a shade as the Kindle Paperwhite leather cover's &#34;Royal Purple&#34; which is as close to perfect a color as ever there was).  I got this for an iPad I've borrowed from work to test my website changes on, since I didn't want to risk the unit being damaged.  This cover doesn't have a lot of padding, so I don't know how much protection it will really be if the ipad is dropped or something like that, but I feel better having the cover than not.  And at this price it's much more affordable than the ones that Apple is selling (with very mixed reviews I might add).It also works alright as a simple stand, though I had some trouble with it at first.  You have to &#34;limber up&#34; the cover a bit first I guess.

$REVIEW.: This support stand is a good second support stand, or as your primary stand as long as it doesn't need to be broken down and set back up again too much. The legs are a bit difficult to open and close. I wouldn't really trust this stand to hold a 10x20 vinyl drop, as I was hoping it could. I am pretty sure that it would bend a little bit in the middle because of the weight of the drop.  I mostly use this for my smaller drops (5-6ft). and it holds up great.I wish that the legs were a little bit easier to use but... you get what you pay for in this case!

$review_text.: Based on other reviews, it is possible that these won't last too long. I've had mine about a month and they are ok for now.But they get 4 stars from me because of one thing: Even with the clunky Mophie battery case on my iPhone, they fit without having to use the pass-through adaptor. (The adaptor itself, sent by Mophie, is awkwardly long and has already died once and had to be replaced). So these let me do without it, and in my opinion, the sound is pretty good. They may not be as sophisticated at isolating background noise as the more expensive Shures I used previously, but they're actually more comfortable to wear.I may buy a backup pair in case they break.

$REVIEW.: Ever since I bought my IPad, I've wanted an under-cabinet mount. I found some dubious mounts from Chinese sellers on the big auction site, and actually ordered one. It cost more than twenty bucks and it didn't even last through the installation (which was stupidly complicated for such a simple piece of equipment.I was surprised and delighted when I found the new Belkin Under Cabinet Mount for iPad and Tablets. It was a name-brand product, priced right, and nice looking--so I went ahead got it.To put it simply, it is beautifully simple--easy to assemble (two pieces, broken down for packaging and shipping), easy to install, easy to install, and easy to use. Once I got the Belkin Under Cabinet Mount for iPad and Tablets in place, it was a 5-second process to get my IPad securely mounted.From a customer perspective, that's a killer value proposition.

I originally wanted to use the unit to work with my entertainment center (we have brownouts regularly in my town) but my power draw was more than the unit can handle on the battery backup side.  Do the math on your electronic power consumption to be sure that you have enough overhead.  I'm moving these into my computer room and ordering the 1500 variant for my entertainment center.  For what it is, it is doing wonderful, it was just my issue for not getting the appropriate size.

$review_text.: I saw this item on geekbeat and instantly knew I wanted it. It does 2 important things, it allows me to have full moving preview of camera image and control things like focus, shutter, focus, etc. while tethered 'wirelessly' and the other is being able to do all that on an ipad.Previously the only way to do this was to connect a netbook to the camera using a cable, then use remote desktop on the iPad to connect to the netbook and control the camera. This had many problems.The ability to touch areas of the image you wan to have in focus is awesome! You can let the camera find focus rather than using manual controls (which are there is you want them).Great for photography in a studio or in a place you don't want to stand next to the camera. Can be combined with a Jib or Pan/tilt head for truly remote photography.Not as good for video - although still usable. Setup is pretty quick, although it uses its own wifi network (acts as AP) and I would prefer that I could just set up the network it can join - like a 4G modem - than can have other devices on it asside from the ipad and CamRanger.I also had a question for tech support. Sent in at 9PM and had an answer 20 min later. 5 stars!My experience is with Canon cameras.

 The grooves to prop up the tablet are much deeper thanthe ones on my case (different brand) for my Tab 2 10.1.The rotating option is easy to use, and it's common sense that you'd have to be careful when positioning the7" tablet vertically

 Seeing this case's deeper grooves has spurred me to search for another case for myself,even though I just bought mine less than 2 months ago

Overall the backpack is very well made and the compartments are pretty nice but I would have preferred a bottle holder on one of the side instead of the two zippered pockets

I wanted to write this review because all of the a sudden the velcro that Caselogic uses for their Strap Management System started to scrape my forearm when I swing the bag over to my shoulder

I have gotten cuts 3 or 4 times already

This is a serious flaw that can cause cuts on your arm

Either smoother out the velcro or use better stitching


Now I have to go look for another bad because of this problem

$REVIEW.: Always used CDs in my cars (I'm 62)-before that, it was cassettes; before that ... oh jeez, I forgot - it was an 8 something.  Bought a 2011 Kia Optima which has an Ipod port (USB+stereo plug output).  Though the car has a nice stereo, it does not have a CD changer - i.e., you can only load and play one CD at a time.  This was my motivation to research and explore Mp3 technology.  At this price point, it made sense to experiment and purchase the Zen Mp3 player rather than an Ipod.  I used the software that came with the Zen to transfer my CDs from my PC onto the Mp3 player.  Haven't dented  the 4gig memory and yet, have 50 or so of my favorite CDs in its memory.  Also, I can select the Mp3 port (Aux) from the stereo controls on the steering wheel as well as control the volume.  The ONLY things I can't do from the steering wheel are turn the Zen on and select the album, artist or playlist I wish to listen to, BUT, there a plenty of red lights and traffic jams at which time I can select my tunes.  As a bonus, I can unplug the Zen from the car and take my music along on a walk in the park.  My girlfriend has a Miata - space is at a premium and CD's use it up quick.  Also, CDs are easily stolen when the top is down.  Next project is to wire up an Aux port in the Miata (DIY info on many websites) and use another refurbished Zen for her music.  Can't say whether an IPod is a better value - I always shop price first - and this is a great piece at a low cost!
$SUMMARY.: Great Piece at Low Cost

$REVIEW.: This zippered sleeve is designed and sized to carry and protect a Samsung Galaxy Tablet, however, I have a number of small electronic devices that fit nicely in this sleeve.The most unique feature is the thick, memory foam that the sleeve is made of. Remember the commercials for the memory foam mattresses that showed a woman bouncing on the mattress that had a glass of wine on the corner of the bed? Remember how the wine didn't spill because of the memory foam's shock absorbing properties? Those same shock absorbing properties will keep your expensive devices safe from damage when zipped up in this sleeve.The memory foam is faced on both sides with a soft, jersey fabric so your screen will be safe from scratches. The zipper on one end has an over-sized, ergonomic zipper pull and a padded collar under the zipper to keep the edge of your device safe from scratches when you zip or unzip the sleeve.LA robe comes in black and wasabi (green) or black and pumpkin (orange). I have the black and wasabi version and I think it's attractive and sleek looking. I am using it for my Sony PSP, as it fits nicely along with the ac adapter. My husband wants me to order a second one to store his 5" TomTom GPS and car adapter in. The sleeve measures 8 3/4" x 5 1/4", in case you are considering using it for devices other than the Galaxy Tab.If you are looking for a sleeve specifically for your Samsung Galaxy, or for other small electronic devices with a screen, this sleeve performs well to protect your investment.

$REVIEW.: Update - January 28, 2013 - This speaker worked great until December 2012, then it simply quit work. It would turn out for about three seconds and turn back off. Even with the cord plugged in, the speaker no longer worked. This was a big disappointment since I used this for presentations. In light of the sudden death with no help on the Altec Lansing website, I would hesitate to give an overwhelming recommendation. In light of this sudden fail, I've dropped my star rating from five stars to three. The sound is great and compatibility is great but the the speaker is not reliable.Original review:This product was easy to set up and easy to use. I like it!I have tried various portable speaker products over the years because I give presentations and like the ability to use audio with my Keynotes or with my iPod. Some are bulky and add to all the stuff I have to carry into the meeting. Others haven't always been reliable.The Alltec Lansing inMotion Air Universal Wireless Speaker arrived yesterday via the Amazon Vine Program, and I unboxed it and starting setting it up. I plugged the unit in and let the batteries charge. Then after about an hour I decided to test it. At first, I was worried since I couldn't find the remote. Then I realized the remote attaches to the speaker. Nice and smart design element. That makes the remote perfect for portability without the fear of losing it.I initially tested this with an iPhone. Setting up is as simple as turning the iPhone Bluetooth "on" and then pressing/holding the source/pair button on the inMotion speaker. The iPhone found the speaker and connected. Music play was flawless.Next I tested my Mac. The inMotion wireless speaker comes with USB Bluetooth antenna for the mac to extend the Bluetooth range to over 300 feet. I inserted the antenna, and the pressing/holding the source/pair button on the inMotion speaker, my mac paired with the speaker. One note on Bluetooth use: when I launched iTunes, finding the inMotion speaker is not at the bottom of the iTunes window as it is for AppleTV. Instead, click the Bluetooth icon on the top menu of Mac. Select "InMotion Air" and "Use as Audio Device."Music sounds great on this speaker and is perfect for someone like me who uses a speaker in boardrooms and such. I highly recommend this easy to use inMotion Air Universal Wireless Speaker.
