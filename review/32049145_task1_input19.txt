$REVIEW.: I seem to be in the minority here, but, putting aside political views and judging the film solely on its merits as a film (which, unfortunately, not all reviewers seem to be able to do), I found this to be a curious failure - curious because I have no idea why Soderbergh felt he needed to make this a two-part (part 1 - the successful revolution in Cuba; part 2 - the failed 1965 revolution in Bolivia), four+ hour film. There is so much in both parts that could have been cut, without losing any of the film's integrity, to make it a "respectable" 2 (maybe 2+) hour film. Del Toro is usually such an intense and passionate actor (just take a look at Traffic, 21 Grams, Things We Lost In The Fire, etc.), so what is so puzzling is why he came up with this one-note monotone performance, one which is so low key that sometimes you don't realize that it is he who is speaking, and sometimes you don't realize he is in the scene at all. There is nothing at all in the performance to indicate Che's charisma and appeal - what was it about him that convinced such a large following? The film is neither intellectually stimulating (whether you agree or disagree, no discussions of the Marxist propaganda used to "educate" the mostly illiterate rebels; no insight into the making of this particular revolutionary), nor viscerally and visually stimulating (the scenes of the fighting between the rebels and the state armies are ho-hum at best). Best give this one a miss, unless you've got 4 1/2 hours to spare.

$REVIEW.: Most of Parker's films are visually interesting. This one is viscerally mesmerizing, as well, partly because he captures the essential undulent, oily sleaziness of the Big Easy so adroitly. I lived in New Orleans for five years and can spot a fraudulent, comercially bent take when I see one (Clint Eastwood comes to mind). Mickey Rourke was one of those hit or miss actors of the 90s (I was one of those who actually liked him in "Barfly"). In this instance he is more than adequate, and he rolls along with the punchy, quirky script like the prize fighter he longed to be. Lisa Bonet, as the Nubian Lolita, is perfectly cast. No need to provide spoilers here, but the ending is one of the all time greatest, where any ambiguity that the filmmaker might have set up for us is exquisitely resolved. Certainly not one of the deepest cinema excursions ever attempted, but one of the most enjoyable, particularly for those who like a little spice and suspense in their gumbo.

$review_text.: I'll get the visceral reaction out of the way quickly
I was disappointed with the movie the first time I watched it, from a director who gave us the original "Alien" and "Blade Runner" plus gripping non-sci fi films such as "Black Rain" and "Gladiator"


The best thing I can say for Director Scott is that I believe the primary problem is not with the premise, which had enormous potential, but in the plot and the line by line writing

But, I watched it a second time the next night, and some of the kinks were ironed out by noticing some lines


Also, the relevance of the Prometheus myth became far clearer, and through it, I realized an important back story explanation which was obscured by the characters' ignorance

Read the Prometheus story before watching the movie and pay very close attention to the opening (and think 2001 opening.)One indicator of how incomplete things seem is that the very old billionaire, Peter Weyland, is played by a fine middle aged actor, Guy Pearce, but we never see him younger in flashbacks, which were probably cut from the final editing
Without giving too much away, the Peter Weyland character adds very little to the story aside from being the person who funds the mission.I sensed something was seriously out of joint when the "away team" enters the cavernous artifact
After encountering something just a bit squeamish, the geologist Fifield (Sean Harris) and biologist Milburn (Rafe Spall) decide to return to the Prometheus (the name of the humans' interstellar space ship.) The remaining team does a fair amount of exploring

Among other things, they see a hologram of the intelligent giants, drawings of whom they found on Earth


they are seeking running from some unseen danger
I saw no clue to what triggered the hologram

Following the hologram, they find the decapitated head of one of the giants (as opposed to the 'aliens' we encountered in earlier films).The captain of the Prometheus sends them a message that a serious storm is approaching
The team, with the usual annoyingly distracting side efforts which slow them down, reach the entrance and begin driving their vehicles back to the ship


But, and here the train falls off the track, never to return, we find Fifield and Milburn still in the artifact, when they said they were returning to the ship


They found some kind of life which intrigued the biologist

But why didn't the team returning to the ship notice that none of their vehicles were gone


Why did they leave the other two behind? Somehow, the two truants don't get the warning about the storm, or ignore it, so they become stuck in the artifact.There are loose ends aplenty with the alien fauna on this desolate world

My expectation coming in was that the film would explore the origins of two creatures, the "Alien" and the race of the giant pilot discovered by the crew of the mining ship Nostromo in "Alien"


We meet the giants soon enough, but we also encounter at least three other life forms which have a passing resemblance to THE Alien, but their connection to the life cycle of the Alien is never explained.I'm entering dangerous "spoiler" territory now, so I will not discuss any more of the plot except to say that there are a number of unexplained events

Mysteries are great in the middle of the film, but one expects most of these to be wrapped up and revealed at the end of the picture

Many are not, leaving a huge jumping off point for a sequel to "Prometheus".Part of the special attraction of this story is that the audience knows full well what will eventually happen, so there is a lot of mental "don't go there" and "don't do that" moments, because we already know what things that look like that can do
The problem with that is that there is too much "quoting" from "Alien" for my tastes


Most of it is done relatively well, but it becomes more and more obvious as time goes on, and increasingly annoying


There is also ample quoting from other major Sci Fi movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (both in situations and in dialogue)
There are also some subtle cinematic (visual) quotes from "Avatar" and "Jurassic Park".One of the bright spots, aside from the imaginative, well done CGI and cinematography, is the acting, which I always thought was a weak spot in "Alien"
The crewmen, such as Captain Idris Elba, are spot on (unlike Yahpet Kotto in "Alien")

Instead of the strong Ellen Ripley character, we have the physically smaller and less imposing archaeologist, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) who sports a convincing English accent as the lead character
Charlize Theron's character is restrained and unlikable


Like both Scott and Cameron's "Alien" and "Aliens", this movie has an android (artificial person) as a principal character, in a role much fuller than in the earlier movies
The only thing which distinguishes 'David', Michael Fassbender's android from Scott's earlier android Ash (Ian Holm, Alien) and Cameron's Bishop (Lance Hendrickson, Aliens)is that David is ever so slightly stilted, somewhat like Data from "Startrek, The Next Generation."I will give this the benefit of the doubt for now, but I found a strong disjoint in the rationale between two early scenes and the climax


I sense Scott wanted to leave plenty of meat on the bone to support a sequel
(In contrast, Avatar is almost totally devoid of preparation for a sequel I suspect I will need to revisit this review after seeing the film again
If my suspicion about gaps and disconnects is born out, I may have to lower my rating to 3 stars.

$REVIEW.: I don't generally take much interest in ballet, but I still found this DVD to be absorbing

A "jete" is a leap with one foot extended forward, and one foot extended back
And that's just the sort of spanning arc this movie makes

It starts with the formal founding of the Ballet Russe in Monte Carlo in the 1930's, goes through the period when two competing versions of the Ballet Russe existed (thus the plural of this documentary's title), and catches up with the current lives of a number of the Ballet's early dancers.Some vintage footage of these early dancers is included, some of it even in color


But the fascination here is the dancers themselves, even more than the dance


We see them as young Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s, just children, recruited by Diaghilev in the 30's

Then we see them being interviewed in 2000-2003 for this documentary and we are given a sense of the texture of a lifetime devoted to the art of dance.The DVD is very generous with its captioning


Everyone is labeled in each dance sequence, and then re-captioned for every current interview, so you can easily keep track of who's who, before-and-after.It's all a very good advertisement for the practice of ballet and might inspire you to take lessons yourself, because you will see how a majority of the early Ballet Russe dancers are still around in good health, and are still active in ballet, mostly as teachers
One of the dancers was actually still performing "character" roles on stage at the time of the interviews.However, one gets a sense that starring ballet dancers of the 30's and 40's might have been subject to fewer grueling demands than modern dancers


Back then, dancers were perhaps expected to be human perfections of grace, but not superhuman specimens
So there is no discussion here of crippling injuries, of arthritis in the wake of years of command contortion, of struggles to keep reed-thin, of any of the health problems that are whispered about among modern dancers

That's the only major flaw I found in this documentary

These dancers might have been in a unique position to compare training and practice regimens then-and-now, and to give any necessary critiques of modern expectation

But you won't find any such discussion on this DVD.However the DVD extras do include a lot of behind-the-scenes gossip and do let us get better acquainted with all the featured players
One of the most memorable is Nathalie Krassovska, who unblinkingly, with a dreamy dramatization of each sentence, focuses off beyond the floodlights - still playing to the balconies.

$REVIEW.: Branagh's epic deserves 5 stars but i substracted one because the DVD contains no special features... which really is inexcusable.Olivier's version to present Henry V as a play within a play is wonderfully subtle at  times and works on several levels... but the gritty atmosphere of Branagh's  version is immediate and gives a stronger suspension of belief.Branagh  is at his best in this film and most dynamic, from Henry's low menacing  rebuke of the Dauphin's 'treasure', to the fierce assault on those poor  half-Fleurs, to the incredible speech to his troops on fields of  Agincourt.the entire cast is superb but casting Jacobi as the Chorus is  sheer genius. he completely set the tone for the film and watching the  film, it's hard to imagine anyone else who could be a better to link  between the viewer with the play.this is an exceptional film that really  deserves a place in any movie collection.

$review_text.: A brilliant adaption to this Broadway musical.Audrey Hepburn (&quot;Breakfast at Tiffiny's&quot;, &quot;The Nun's Story&quot;) is perfect for the role of Eliza Dolittle. From her accent as a flower seller, all the way to the beauty of the grand ball, she plays this role as if it's who she is. Rex Harrison (Doctor Dolittle) plays Professor Higgins, as he did in the Broadway musical. He has become the only person we could ever see in this role, as well as the first person who comes to mind when thinking about this film.The only criticism I have for this film is concerning the music. Hepburn, while I beautiful actress, is a TERRIBLE singer. Knowing this fact, the director casted someone to sing all of Hepburn's songs for her. The lip-sinking is pretty bad on some of the songs, the most noticable being on the song 'I Could Have Danced All Night' where Hepburn is not ever CLOSE to being in sink with the song. On the song 'Wouldn't It Be Lovely', the singer's voice comes out with a slightly different accent that Hepburn had. These are very slight flaws; you would only notice them if you were looking for them. All in all, this is a beautifully made movie, deserving all the awards that were given to the show.

$review_text.: If you are an Orthodox Jew, or anywhere close to being one, you will enjoy this movie

The beginning goes back and forth between the two worlds of Orthodox New York Hassidim and New York police

Why would the two worlds ever meet? Suddenly, one of the Jews goes missing

No one can find him anywhere

After the police are called in (read Melanie Griffith as a street smart cop), we find out that the missing Jew was murdered
Melanie Griffith AKA Emily Eden must solve the murder


Clearly, it was an inside job


But WHO among this tight knit group would do such a thing!!! While Emily is clearly the stranger in the Hassidic neighborhood, the concept is examined on many levels


There is a Jewish cop that Emily works with who knows nothing at all about being Jewish except &#34;eating bagels on Sunday morning.&#34; The actual killer is someone that the viewer would never suspect; but is truly a stranger among the people


PLEASE BE ADVISED: This film seems to have an ending that involves the Italian mafia of NY

THIS IS NOT WHERE THE FILM ENDS

PLEASE CONTINUE TO WATCH THE FILM UNTIL IT'S EXCITING CONCLUSION.

$review_text.: I feel about Sleepy Hollow just as I do many of Tim Burton's movies.  The cinematography is there, the costumes are there, the music is there, the action and pacing are there--but Burton gives me nothing that makes me care  one way or another about these characters.Great characterization is, to  me, what separates the truly great movies from those that are merely  mechanically proficient.  It's like listening to a virtuoso guitarist who  does not have any soul or feeling in his music.  You can marvel at his  technical proficiency, and you have to respect the dedication and hours of  practice, but if the music doesn't move you, what's the point?This is  what I felt like after seeing Sleepy Hollow.  Burton gave me nothing that  made me care whether any of the characters lived or died.  The characters  are merely props to move the story along.  I'm not saying every character  has to be likable, but rather the director/writer/actor must make me care  one way or the other.  I will say that an exception to this rule was Mars  Attacks, which was a ridiculous comedy farce that I loved--character is not  so much of an issue in that type of a movie.  Given that characterization  is Burton's weak point, Mars Attacks was a great type of movie for Burton  because of the lack of a requirement for characterization.That said, I  know that there are lots of people who love Tim Burton's movies, and I have  a great deal of respect for Burton's work, but if you are the type of  person, like me, who requires great characters to pull you into a movie,  Sleepy Hollow might not be for you.  If you've liked lots of Burton's other  movies, though, then you'll most likely love this one too.  It certainly is  well executed.

$review_text.: This film is the best, most comprehensive documentary on Stax Records ever released. It covers the entire history of Stax from its origins in Memphis to its resurrection as a part of the Fantasy Organization in the 1980s and 1990s. All the famous artists are there, unlike some of the other footage that has been released, starting with a French documentary in the early 1990s. It makes fascinating viewing for all Soul enthusiasts.However, this is not meant to be a comprehensive review. This film's highlight is that it contains the rarest clip of Albert King EVER shown (this is besides his brief appearance in Wattstax and the bonus clip of him doing "I'll Play The Blues For You"). It is in colour and he is playing his break from "Blues Power". While the audio narration goes over part of this, if you are a Blues lover this is the rarest film of him ever shown. He is also playing his Korina wood Gibson Flying-V original "Lucy" (now worth in excess of $100,000). Wouldn't it be unbelieveable to see the entire concert--King at his height in the late 1960s! It is in colour and the sound is great too! To access it on the DVD-go to scene selection and view it from "CBS".I apologise if my enthusiasm for this may be too much. But this is so rare, and even if it's only just over a minute, all Blues lovers should see this. It is at least 12 years earlier than anything ever released so far.Plus the documentary is five stars too!!!!

$REVIEW.: The first time I watched this movie, I turned it off after about twenty minutes. I just couldn't get into at all for some reason. I was laying on the couch with my girl (my ex- now), who fell asleep after about fifteen minutes, and, for some reason, I could not see where the appeal was in this movie. I really didn't think I'd even bother trying to watch it again. Well, the next night my girl went home early, so me an' my homeboy bought a couple 18 cases'a beer an' ordered a pizza and decided just for the hell of it to pop in the movie.  I started it back at the beginning and we sat there, seeing if we could not only comprehend, but enjoy the film.  Well, I don't know if it was the alcohol, but when the movie was finished, I sat there in awe at what I had just seen, which was what I perceived as one of the best films in the past decade of cinema. I may be overstating it a little, but there's jus' sumpin' really alluring here that I'm not sure how to describe.Unlike many viewers I've read here, I never once felt compelled to watch it with the sub-titles on, even if I didn't really understand some things. Instead, I was compelled to watch it over and over again to catch it all (I watched it twice in that first night and then again the next day! Okay, okay, I was unemployed at the time, but STILL). The story involves diamonds an' underground bare-knuckle boxing and different gangs of underworld characters with seemingly-irrelevant sub plots that all intertwine into one single WEIRD-ARSE story. The brilliant ensemble cast really bring the material to life. Even in his surprisingly small role, Benicio del Toro as Frankie Four Fingers, the high-profile thief who steals the diamond and has it in a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist, turns in a unique, great performance. But is' definitely Pitt who steals the show though as "One Punch Mickey", an Irish Gypsy who becomes a pawn for two shady promoters who are in hock to a crime czar. Pitt is probably the most incomprehensible character in the entire movie, too. I mean, most of the time you really cannot understand a DAMN thing he is saying, but it makes it all the more fun.The ending of this film will definitely trip you out, and I encourage repeat viewings from everyone who watches this movie. Guy Ritchie is turning out to be a very interesting director who I'm going to have to keep my eye on and see how his other projects turn out. I haven't seen 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels' yet, and, from what I gather reading other reviews, it is very similar to 'Snatch'. I guess some people would view that as a good thing and some would view that as a bad thing. Don't worry, I ain't gonna form an opinion until I see it, but, any movie that is as smart, and well-executed as this one is sure to be a favorite of mine. I enjoyed this movie even more than I enjoyed 'Pulp Fiction' if you wanna know how good I think it is, and I'm also downright ashamed that I didn't feel it the first time around. So, to all new viewers, when you watch it, don't be too quick to judge, because it may take a little bit to pull you in. But once it does, youse in for a real treat.

$REVIEW.: Planet Earth is an amazing ten part documentary about the wondrous pristine natural world, some of which focus on creatures and places that had never been captured on camera before. I loved all ten parts, each on a distict type of environment of the planet. Surprisingly my favorite of them was the one on deserts (not an area I had been particularly interested in in the past), with its jumping lizards and head-butting antelopes and the swarm of locusts which looks likes a massive ring of smoke from afar but comes off terrifying clos up. Some of my favorites items from other parts include the amazing slow motion shots of Great White Sharks hunting seals on the part on shallow seas, and the rare Snow Leopard chasing its prey down steep dangerous rocky slopes on the Mountains episode. There's too much great, fascinating and exciting stuff for me to describe, and since I purchased the set I've watched each part at least twice. Also on the DVD version are three additional documentaries on the future of this planet, and they in my opinion aren't near as fascinating as the main stuff but are still well worth watching.I bought the DVD version, and while it doesn't take full effect of the special HD cameras used, it looks as detailed and crisp as any DVD I have ever seen. The sound on my 5.1 system also sounded superb. Bottom line is I can't imagine anyone of any age or personality, male or female, not enjoying Plant Earth. And now at the lower price it's a no-brainer.

$REVIEW.: I won't be providing another long-winded review of a great ending to a great trilogy. I thought it important though to let everyone know that the Digital Copy for this film does NOT include iTunes - it is strictly Ultraviolet, which is a code word for we'll let you watch the film digitally... as long as we control the how you do part. That is enough for me to pass on this version and spend the same money on the boxed trilogy (and sell my individual copies of the first two films).

$review_text.: There is an audio commentary by film historian Peter Cowie. He points out that while not naming names, the screenplay for Z is a scathing commentary of the then-government of Greece, Costa-Gavras home country. Cowie talks about Z's place within the context of political cinema in the 1960s. He also talks briefly about the Greek history that informed the events depicted in Gavras' film. Cowie does a good job of giving brief bios of key cast members and how they got involved with Z. This is a very informative track with in-depth analysis."It's Intentional: Costa-Gavras on Z" is a brand new interview with filmmaker made exclusively for this DVD. He views filmmaking as a form of activism and with Z he wanted to comment on post-World War II Greece. He talks about going to Paris to study as a young man and while there discovering cinema. He also touches upon the origins of Z."Raoul Coutard Shoots Z" is an interview with the film's cinematographer who talks about how he came to work on the film and his impressions of Gavras' working methods in comparison with someone like Jean-Luc Godard. He praises the cast, especially Yves Montand's professionalism.Author Vassilis Vassilikos talks about his book on which the film was based on. He also speaks at length about the assassination.Gavras and actors Yves Montand, Irene Papas, Jacques Perrin, and Jean-Louis Trintignant talk about the film. The actors speak about drew them to the film.In another interview, Gavras Perrin and Pierre Dux talk briefly about making the film. Gavras explains the meaning of the film's title.Finally, there is a trailer that is dynamically edited with excerpts of the film's pulsating soundtrack.

$REVIEW.: Julianne Moore was magnificent in both "The Hours," as a suburban 1940's housewife, unhappy with her life and family, hiding repressed sexual feelings toward her best friend, Kitty, and in "Far From Heaven," as a 1950's housewife whose husband is hiding his homosexuality, but is unable to control his sexual feelings toward members of the same sex. This made me wonder, can an actress be nominated for two Oscars in the same year--one for Best Actress and one for Best Supporting Actress? She certainly deserves it. Julianne Moore is most certainly an exceptional artist, playing her roles with renewed vigor and great emotion. While both story-lines may sound incredibly similar, the character of Cathy in "Far From Heaven" cannot be more different than that of Laura Brown in "The Hours," and Moore plays both characters wonderfully. Cathy is a loving wife, devoted to her husband and two children. She is living the perfect 1950's suburban life, until her husband's secret obsession threatens to tear their family apart. Dennis Quaid is superb as her husband, and Dennis Haysbert is surprisingly successful in his portrayal of the man who comforts Cathy in her time of need. The feel for the era is most certainly there, and Todd Haynes does a brilliant job of directing, as well as adding little touches here and there. This is much like a sitcom from the 50's, which quickly takes a few drastic turns. Sexuality and racism are explored as things take a turn for the worse. "Far From Heaven" is truly engrossing, wih great performances all around, including Patricia Clarkson, an underrated actress who plays best friend to Cathy. This is a heart-felt and powerful film. A definite must-see for anyone who appreciates a good film.

$review_text.: Written & Directed by Ralph BakshiQuote:In a post apocalyptic future that appears as a blend of World War II Europe and J.R.R

Tolkien's Middle-earth, a pint-size wizard named Avatar must save the world from a band of fascist mutants controlled by his evil twin brother, Blackwolf, who likes to confuse enemy armies by projecting films of Adolf Hitler speeches during attacks
Painted live-action footage of advancing Nazi armies contrasts with Saturday-morning-cartoon-style animation of fairies and elves as Avatar travels through various magical and radioactive realms on his quest

Aiding him are the beautiful Fairy princess Elinore, hot-blooded warrior elf Weehawk, and Peace, a misunderstood robot rebelling against his Blackwolf-controlled programming

A bizarre and psychedelic meditation on magic vs

technology, this ultimate futuristic fantastic epic cult film still finds an audience on college campuses and will prove quite rewarding to viewers in the right frame of mind.A Few thoughts of my own here:1

This movie is definitely NOT for anyone under 18

There is considerable violence & bloodshed, even for an animated movie

It is not quite as graphic as a movie like Heavy Metal, but in addition to the violence, & sexual talk & situations, (though subtle), & there are a few, (but not many), curse words used throughout this movie.Now, I tell you this NOT to drive you away from this movie, (which I think is excellent), but simply to inform you as to what to expect
It is a movie about a war after all.2


The plot summary that I have given you here is very good in summing up this movie, but I cannot totally agree with this statement:Quote:Saturday-morning-cartoon-style animationSaturday morning animation was never like this.The characters are more surreal than the classic animation of Saturday morning cartoons


The characters, (especially Elinor), are more "sensual looking" than in standard cartoon animation

The whole setting of WIZARDS is very surreal, incorporating ink & pen animation, Rotoscoping, charcoal & pencil artworks, as well as historical footage from World War 2.And yet despite all these different styles of animation-it is the story line & characterizations that really drive WIZARDS.The character of the good wizard Avatar, voiced brilliantly by Bob Holt, (Dinky Dalton & Grape Ape from Laff-a-Lympics, Mr


Sea Worthy from the Snorks, & Homer Zukkerman from 1973's Charlotte's Web movie), is initially seen as somewhat of a bumbling wizard, who really doesn't seem very powerful
He does have a good heart though, but really feels his age, (well over 3,000 years), & only reluctantly realizes that he must face his brother Blackwolf once & for allElinor is voiced by actress Jesse Welles, who while she doesn't have many voice credits, does a wonderful job of portraying the buxom, fairy-in-training

She does seem to be a little flighty, but is quite determined to avenge her father's death at the hands of one of Blackwolf's assassins
She is not afraid to use her "sensuousness" to get what she wants, & sometimes acts without thinking, which proves to be almost disastrous at times.The elf Weehawk, voiced by Richard Romanus, is a true warrior, who feels that fighting is the only way to accomplish anything
He is hot-headed & impulsive, & ready to jump into battle at a moments notice


He sometimes has to be "reigned-in" by Avatar
Like Jesse Welles, Richard does not have many voice credits to his name, but gives a dynamic performance as the hot-headed Weehawk.Steve Gravers, who voices Avatar's evil brother Blackwolf, is another actor, who like Jesse & Richard, does not have many voice credits to his name, but that doesn't stop him from a driving & dynamic performance as the deliciously evil wizard

His performance as the single-minded Blackwolf is wonderful to watch


Totally ruthless, he will do whatever it takes to claim the good lands to escape his own radiation scarred homeland.David Proval is another actor, who doesn't have that many voice credits, but, (with the few lines that he does have), does a very convincing job as the Blackwolf driven robot assassin Nekron99, renamed Peace by Avatar, who is the one who kills Elinor's father


After Avatar has a little "talk" to Peace, (under the threat of torture if he doesn't guide the small company of Elinor, Weehawk, & himself), we begin to see that Peace really does want to be free of Blackwolf's influence
We can hear that in his voice.Three other things to mention:Although it is a small part, actor Mark Hamill, (Star Wars), portrays a mountain fairy named Shawn, who offers to guide Avatar & company.Also, the music chosen for WIZARDS, is is almost surreal in its sound
In particular, there is a song sung by the character of Elinor, (& sung by either actress Susan Anton or Jesse Welles-I can't find a definitive answer
IMDB lists it as being sung by Anton), called "Only Time Will Tell"


It is a wonderfully haunting melody, that adds to the surreal feel of the movie.Susan Tyrell, who was WIZARD'S narrator, recently died on 6/17/12


It was her voice, which tied the whole movie together.This is a movie that is very polarized in the classic battle between good & evil


You "feel" for the good characters

It is an emotion-driven film that, while it is not everyone's "cup-of-tea", IS a must-see for all animation fans.

Again not must sees but interesting and good solid acting. I became a fan. I missed this one. And I am glad I discovered it as she has not been in a lot and what she has . . . well the roles are not the same. Anyway this movie is set in a beautiful country with beautiful scenery about a beautiful kind person and the love she shares with another. The ending kinda ruins the movie for me a little. If the ending had been done a little differently this movie would have reached classic status I think.

$REVIEW.: A woman in a camouflage uniform dashes through a dense forest somewhere in the United States as a camouflaged man is pursuing her.  All of a sudden they are both stopped by a third camouflaged dressed man who asks the man who is pursuing the girl if he wants to quit by handing in his number.  The audience will be slightly bewildered at this set up as the audience is simply tossed into the story.  However, this is the mysterious magic that David Mamet brings to the audience as he depicts an intense military jargoned kidnapping drama.It is revealed for the audience that the third man who asked if the pursuing man in a camouflage uniform wanted to quit is named Scott (Val Kilmer) and he is a special operative for the CIA and United States military.  Scott is known to them as a methodical problem solver who always solves his problems.  This is essential as Scott is being called upon to recover a missing person who appears to have been kidnapped.  The missing person's identity is never fully revealed as they only refer to her as "the girl", but it is obvious that she is an important person as the CIA is willing to recover her at any cost.The Spartan is a journey into a world where decisions are made under gun point and a wrong decision could get one killed.  These decisions have to be made on a rapid succession as each decision has a consequence that will influence all parties involved.  The audience is lead into highly suspenseful cinematic experience through the meticulously written script by Mamet that depicts this intense atmosphere.  The cinematography combined with the careful direction of Mamet boosts the anticipation for what is to come, which enhances the suspense of the cinematic experience.

$review_text.: Now this is Indie Horror done right. SATAN'S LITTLE HELPER is smart, original, and extremely dark. A young boy obsessed with his video game Satan's Little Helper enlists himself to help a masked serial killer he mistakes for the horned demon as the two commit atrocious crimes that the naive kid mistakes as being part of the game. Many will have to forgive the often goofy acting from each of the side players, but it is the costumed character of Satan that really sells this flick. With a sinister latex grin and exaggerated physical humor, this speechless villain adds a unique mixture of comedy and terror throughout the night's events. It is presumed that the character beneath the mask is human, however the film does leave enough intrigue as to keep the audience guessing until the end. In a favorite scene, Dougie jumps in the front of a shopping cart as Satan runs down a pregnant woman, a baby carriage, and a blind man while Dougie cheers and tallies the points. The one area where the film could use the most work is in its overly long ending, which could easily have been reeled back 10-15m to become more effective and concise. Director Jeff Lieberman has done a lot with a very little here, and instills the darkest humor possible in what I consider to be an instant Halloween classic. The film will not appeal to all genre fans, but for those of you that share my taste for Indie Horror, it is a refreshing surprise and well worth a view!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies

$review_text.: Do you think those reviewers who HATE HATE HATE this movie were expecting another Meatballs or Caddyshack?  I imagine that the movie company deserves some blame as they did sell this movie as a comedy.  I think it is an absolutely brilliant movie.  I have found that my friends who have travelled to the Far East and have encountered the culture shock displayed in the movie all like this movie.  I think it's easier to relate to the jetlag, culture shocked world in which the characters find themselves.  I certainly can understand how being dropped into an alien world would cause one to assess all their assumptions and find themselves lost as the characters do.I think the ennui and the unresolved nature of the movie disturbs a lot of people.  Most movie goers seem to like a neat little story in which the protagonist changes and becomes a better person or the bad guy gets what's coming to them.  This movie is realistic to me because a) the old man DOESN'T sleep with the young girl. b) there is no SOLUTION for their problems (they are just able to console each other) c) their relationship is realistic because in their own society they would have nothing in common but here in Japan they are kindred souls.  Their relationship is of a transitory nature based on the situation and the place they are in their lives.

$REVIEW.: After the cliffhanger ending of the "Matrix Reloaded", this third and final entry in the Wachowski Brothers' movie trilogy is a fantastic but controversial closer to this stunning movie series. The machines under control of the renegade program Agent Smith are fast approaching the underground city of Zion where the last remains of humanity takes its last stand against them, while Agent Smith is gaining more power by the minute. Neo is now the only one who can be able to defeat Smith for good. However, he is trapped somewhere outside the regular world and the Matrix on a mysterious train station and a very unpleasant individual called the Trainman who controls the train station can free him from there. After much hell, they manage to free Neo from the train station and now Neo must fight and defeat Agent Smith once and for all as he is the only one who can truly save humanity from total extinction. This might sound a little too close to being similar in plot to "The Terminator" but this isn't time-traveling like from those movies.The special effects on this movie are amazing but at times can really go over the top. I especially love the scenery and the way the ship moves through the various tunnels. I've also felt that this movie is much darker than the last two Matrix movies and at times, it even reminds me of the creepiness of "Event Horizon" from a few years back. The massive battle scenes are just awesome and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole time they occur.I know Neo is one of the center characters and Keanu Reeves does such an excellent job at bringing Neo to life but from my opinion, it's Hugo Weaving who really steals the spotlight. Weaving does such a fantastic job at playing the numerous replicates of Agent Smith that he easily tosses just about everyone else on the cast into orbit around the earth. I must say, outside of playing Elrond, I will forever remember Hugo Weaving here as he can really play some frightening bad guys and this movie proves just that. Weaving is scary as the dangerous program Agent Smith. The rest of the actors/ actresses except for Bellucci (Persephone) and the guy, who played Merovingian, do pretty well.As awesome as this is, there are quite a few gripes I have with this movie. First, with such a wide variety of different realities and high number of questions that the previous two left us wondering, "Revolutions" only seemed to answer a few of them yet also created a whole new trainload of new questions that are never answered. The ending even if this is the final trilogy, doesn't seem to quite give a sense of the danger now gone for good but I guess these things were the purpose. On the other hand, I can see why they didn't have so everything is answered as it would be just about impossible to have answers handed over in real life. I can also understand why it is confusing as this movie was designed to make one figure out what was going on and how fate is almost impossible to escape. Very disappointed.I felt gravely disappointed with Merovingian and Persephone. We saw Persephone help Morpheus Neo and Trinity and kill one of Merovingian's henchmen but here, she was just totally dumbed-down to just a deaf mute character on here and the couple only appear for about may a few minutes altogether. I expected a lot more out of these two, whether Persephone would battle her husband or betray Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus. I felt hugely disappointed with these two and felt that this movie could have done without them. I especially hated the way she looked on this movie. The repulsive outfit that she wore looked so tight that those busts looked like they would have their blood circulation cut off. Yergh! Bellucci was good in the "Reloaded" movie but here, she has brought along some of the emptiest acting that I've seen in many years.The main flaw in this movie is that with such a HUGE dimensions that this movie tackles, just the two hour and fifteen minute length only covers the tip of the iceberg. I think that this movie would've been so much better had it been extended for at least another half hour or even up to over three hours long. Perhaps the movie studios are planning on releasing Platinum Extended Editions with new footage incorporated into the movies the way they did with "Lord of the Rings", I don't know but I felt that "Matrix Revolutions" length doesn't do it a lot of justice. For what it is, "Matrix Revolutions" is awesome, but it could really have been an outstanding epic finale. This is a definite must-own movie whenever it comes out on DVD but I feel that this had a lot of room for improvement and that they blew their chance at it. Then again maybe they are planning on releasing an extended edition of this movie in the foreseeable future to make up for the flaws on here. I can understand how many were disappointed with this movie but even then, this doesn't deserve the high number of negative reviews.It's still a very good movie and the tons and tons of awesome action, battle scenes along with the tons of fun in this film make up for the missteps on here but the missteps are bigger than those in "Reloaded". They created a fantastic trilogy that well definitely be sci-fi classics in the years to come. Go and see this movie today. Just don't expect anything near perfection and if you can get by some of the major flaws, this is just an awesome movie. I can't wait to have all three of these movies once they are all on DVD.

$REVIEW.: have the Kleenex ready!  My mom, 10-year-old son, 6-year-old daughter, and myself just finished watching BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA

 This is definitely a family film that everyone will find enjoyable


 However, since it does (at least most of the time) closely follow the book of the same name by Katherine Paterson (Bridge to Terabithia), if you've read it you'll know that the tears will come.As a fantasy film, it's on the light side


 This isn't the kids' version of a huge fantasy epic such asThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition), so don't go into it expecting to see tons of special effects.However, as a "struggling to fit in" story that features two middle-grade students, this movie scores high


 This is the type of "bullies-crush on the teacher-surviving middle school" story that will never be out of fashion.Overall, an entertaining yet sad family film I would recommend to others.

Such an excellent story

I'm in my 30's and have seen it dozens of times as well as the others in the series


This movie follows the book almost exactly

Very well done.

$review_text.: I've never fought/worked in a tank, but I've dealt with enough folks who have to know that a lot of the technical detail inside the tank is not on - I'll leave it to tankers to fix those mistakes in the reviews.  It was the tech inaccuracies that kept me from going to four stars.That said, the film is not entirely without merit.It does a good job, like Amos Gitai's Kippur ( http://www.amazon.ca/Kippur-Widescreen-Liron-Levo/dp/B00003CYBS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1387301105&sr;=8-2&keywords;=kippur+dvd ), of showing the confusion and, at times, seemingly ad-hoc nature of warfare as seen by the lowest level of the pyramid/pointiest end of the &#34;spear&#34;.  Do what you have to do next, no need to see the bigger picture because you're too busy doing - move now, out.At a different level, is this a bit of a parable, with the tankers representing Israeli society, getting fed just enough information to get the most critical jobs done next, with no real big picture view for a lot of people?  I don't agree or disagree with this viewpoint, but just saying there's enough there to merit the discussion.

$review_text.: I'd not known of Hands Over the City till recently, but surely, given it was released in 1963, a case could be made "Hands" belongs to the post war Italian neo-realist canon, and deserves to stand with such famed neo-realist works like Open City and Bicycle Thief. Yet, for a film over 40 years old, it is remarkably contemporary and its relevance can't be denied.  I can't imagine why Marty Scorsese would overlook this gritty, tough film in his "My Voyage to Italy" for there is much here to admire, and most important, that Rosi makes no concession to spoon feed the narrative to his audience. It is a complicated and challenging work, full of fast moving ideas that may take more than one viewing to sort through the nuances, not to mention all the characters and issues - but it's well worth it. Rich, robust film making, this, and I plan to revisit "Hands" often because it easily sustains multiple viewings. Looking for a real movie that packs a wallop? You've found it.

This is my favourite Rossini opera, principally because in this opera, Rossini's musical writing appears very close to Mozart.  When all is said and done though, Rossini is no Mozart and one can tire of Rossini.  By contrast,  Mozart's operas have something of the eternal about them.

$review_text.: "Testosterone" surprised me.  It kept me interested throughout & provided some surprises.  Director David Moreton shot the whole film in Argentina.  Buenos Aires is a lovely setting and adds a fresh feel to the film.  In the DVD extras, Moreton talks about when they started filming the hotel scene, he commented on how small the room was and the proprietor offered to knock out a wall to make the room bigger.  One can't get more accommodating than that!  I also like the brief animation sequence that introduces the film.The film has a lot to offer.  David Sutcliffe who has become a television fixture on "The Gilmore Girls" is able to carry the film.  While I agree that the ending creates problems since we still need to like Dean Seagrave, Sutcliffe keeps us riveted as he pursues Pablo.  Antonio Sabato Jr. who lifted ratings in the 90s for "General Hospital" has a paper-thin role as Pablo.  In retrospect, if Pablo had just communicated with Dean instead of evaporating, we wouldn't have had a premise for the film.Sonia Braga, the lovely Brazilian actress, is so perfect as Pablo's mother!  After having loved her performance inAngel Eyes, it was nice to see her in a film where she's got a superb wardrobe and great makeup, which was the character.Jennifer Coolidge who wowed me inLegally Blonde (Special Edition)adds a lot as the editor Louise.  Her "shaved" line was probably the most hilarious moment in the film.  I see that she's working with the director David Moreton again on a new film "The Last Stan."  Leonardo Brzezicki as Marcos has a great look and handles much of his part well.  Marcos is not a deep character, but he does a good job.  Argentine actress Celina Font does a good job as Sofia who weaves herself into the plot.I found this to be an interesting film with some problems in the script because of the ending.  The "Crazy In Alabama" deleted scene was cute, but I can see why it was cut.  The film left me wondering if Dean would ever face the consequences for his actions.  I was surprised how he seemed to operate above the law for much of the film.  However, while not perfect, "Testosterone" was good for an evening's entertainment.  Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: The acting in this film is well done. They all sell their respective parts. In this movie we follow Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) from his early days in the early 1980s as an immigrant in New York to the present. One day when checking out menu of their family's competition across the street, he is witness to a Russian Mob assassination attempt. Of course the amount of ammo being used grabs Yuri's attention. For he thinks everyone needs bullets. And this is all he needs to try his hand at gun running.He starts off his business by being a reseller of Uzi's in New York and works his way up to arming countries. As Yuri deals his product, the repercussions of his sales are not glossed over. We see the havoc and death they bring. The sad part of the movie is what Yuri says is true; most of what he does is legal. Yuri is a brilliant businessman and criminal, and can think on his feet. The movie has the feel of reality to it.When you see the volumes of arms he sells and the death it brings. It makes a strong statement. But I think the bigger statement is the fact that the five largest arms dealers in the world are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council itself (U.S., China, France, Great Britain and France). And they continue to sell to whom ever will buy.Watch this movie. There are no spots in where you will be bored. But I will suggest that you do not let your young children watch it, for there are some very bloody and realistic death scenes.

I'm American and do take offence that the least refined people are both Americans-they are ludicrous. The lady of the house is american and charming (Elizabeth McGovern) but Shirly MacLaine and her son (a good actor usually) have lines that are embarrassing and crude.  She dresses horribly. Why pick on America so obviously? We have as many refined, well dressed people as you guys do.

 I went to France recently and ended up getting the entire series while I was there


 I also found My So-Called Life on DVD while I was in the UK awhile back, but luckily, MSCL was finally released in the States yesterday


 I don't understand why all these American shows are widely available abroad but not at home

 Ally is a great show that deserves 5 stars but the lack of availability for the home audience is why I'm giving it one

 Hopefully, the powers-that-be will finally get a clue and release this to their loyal (and willing to spend $$$) fan base.

$review_text.: After having acquired the DVD version of "The Legend of Boggy Creek", a movie I enjoyed "way back when" (and find I still do), I noticed a lot of media association between it and this film, "The Creature From Black Lake". I also noticed "Black Lake" starred Jack Elam and Dub Taylor , two of the greatest character actors who ever worked in the film business . These connections made me purchase this movie.I am not sorry I did. Is this the be-all-and-end-all of scary movie making? No, it isn't. Is it a "dud", a "stinker", a waste of money and viewing time. No, it isn't THAT either!!!  It is a "B" picture, what used to be called a "Drive-In Flick" and an entertaining one at that.It was obviously inspired by "Boggy Creek". It begins withthe same kind of spooky photographic tour of creepy, desolate swamplands (both movies have turtles jumping off logs into the water). These are the opening credits sequences, alive with thesounds of croaking bullfrogs and screeching waterfowl. VERY "Boggy Creek". Add to that the musical score , which was composed by the same composer who DID "Boggy Creek", Jaime Mendoza-Nava, and you get a very similar "feel" with the material.The difference in the two films is that "Boggy" is re-created , basically non-fictional docu-drama, whereas "Black Lake" is fiction based on alledged anecdotal fact. "Lake" uses no narration, as "Boggy" does, and moves along as a typical "booger" movie except for the fact that it really doesn't become truly frightening until close to the end.Jim McCullough and Joy Houck, Jr., the producer and director, respectively, have taken a cue from some classic old time movie directors like Val Lewton and learned that an audience has more empathy for characters in danger if they feel they KNOW these characters and have "bonded" with them, than if they are just "faces" to be stalked and slaughtered. The old masters knew you got more audience involvement, feelingwise, if ONE character you "knew" and "liked" was being terrorised upstairs in a house by a maniac than if 1,273 anonymous running individuals got stomped by Godzilla. That's how human psychology works.In this movie you are introduced to a gaggle of pretty likeable characters early on; two University of Chicago cryptozoology students (Dennis Fimple and John David Carson), a cranky local sheriff with little time or patience with monster foolishness, cute eye-candy girls and colorful locals...some of whom have SEEN the "booger". A great deal of the movie is likeably amusing, somewhat comical, only mildly frightening. This is the "set up" part of the film, the part which engages you with the characters. It comprises about the first 80% of the movie. Then "Black Lake" takes a sharp turn into frightfulness and becomes quite brutal and nerve-wracking. It turns into the scary thing the promos claimed it was, and it does so very effectively. The mechanical and make-up effects are quite good for a low budget effort and the acting is decent all the way around. Elam and Taylor, of course, are superb, but Fimple and Carson as the students are good in their roles as well. The only quibble I have with Fimple's character, "Pahoo", is that he is supposed to be a Vietnam vet and he comes closer to depicting a beardless "Shaggy Rogers" without a Scooby Doo. The sense of weaponscraft and camp security a real such ex-warrior would realistically possess are just not there. The two young leads are told this is a vicious killing thing, but they go after it with only one weapon and at a crucial plot turn it is found to be  not loaded. They "forgot". A typical Hollywood plot device...utterly unbelievable...that serves no purpose than to set up a dangerous confrontation that puts the principals in jeopardy.Despite some plot holes like this (which almost ALL "B" pictures are encumbered with) "Black Lake" moves along pretty darn well and ultimately satisfies. I think some reviewers want high-tension, blood-and-guts savagery thoughout the movie (like "Jason" or "The Creeper" might provide them) and this one isn't structured that way. Taken as a whole, though, it is a nice little "old school" chiller that is well worth watching.

If I could, I'd give it 10 stars

If you like dark comedies, drugs or perhaps both, you'll certainly appreciate this movie

I think Requiem For A Dream pulls some of it's style from Drugstore Cowboy, at least it seems to look that way to me, so if you like Requiem (which is also an outstanding movie) but want to watch something a little less sad, Drugstore Cowboy is an excellent choice
Because of it, I'll never leave a hat on a bed ever


My boyfriend ironically feels the same way about hats

I've watched this movie too many times to count, but everytime, it's just as enjoyable


I love when they create the diversion in front of the hospital...classic! And the scene where they trick the cops is quite clever

Makes me wish I'd thought of it


Happy viewing...you will be in the minority if you don't enjoy this movie!

Sometimes such narration can be annoying, but this explains the depths of their emotions at the time.If you're looking at fast-paced, formulaic entertainment, this is not the movie for you.

$review_text.: This movie certainly is not for everyone.  It starts out very promising with some very funny "fake" trailers.  Then the squirming begins.  This movie funny, but it isn't a laugh out loud, tears streaming down your face funny.  It's more of a "Oh my gosh, I can't believe they just did that" snicker.  You almost feel bad for watching it because you will find things humorous that you somehow feel you shouldn't, but you will smile anyways.  I personally found it to be entertaining and I bought the Blu-Ray even after seeing it in theaters so it wasn't a blind buy.  It's one of those movies that I will enjoy watching with others just to see how they react.  For most people, I would say this is a rental unless you catch a good deal, but you should make the effort to see it.  The performances are great and this has become only the second movie that I have enjoyed Robert Downey Jr in, with Iron Man being the first.  Jack Black was the only character that I really didn't like for most of the movie.  I just wanted to watch him in "The Fatties" which is his characters money maker.  Anyways, again, it's a solid rental, but if your thing is comedy, action and a lot of uncomfortableness, then go ahead and buy it.  It looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray and you might end up liking it like me.

$REVIEW.: This is a favorite movie of my daughters and mine.  Before we had our satellit service brought back, we had nothing but a lot of VHS movies to watch.  Well between the Elmo tapes and The Muppet movies, we had 'A Very Brady Sequel'.  Now she was only four or five at the time, but she loved that movie so much, we HAD to watch it at least twice a day, EVERY day.  The whole movie is just really fun and as a child growing up in the latter part of the 70's, I can remember the clothing and assorted references to that era.  Jan has always been my favorite.  Well as luck would have it, I found that old VHS tape and wouldn't you know it, the VCR is broke.  Well my daughter is 10 now and still has fond memories of that time when it was just us two and that movie.  She can't wait to see it again real soon.  Thank you Amazon for letting me know its out there and that we are not alone in our love for this movie.  This will definitely be among my next purchases.

$REVIEW.: For some of us WINCHESTER '73 is THE Western
 (Um, okay, some of us are given to hyperbole and prone to exaggerate for effect

 So what if I have a half-dozen or so THE Westerns?  It's a big genre with more than its share of classic movies

 Let me put it this way - whatever mountain we're talking about, WINCHESTER '73 is going to be one of the tall peaks at the summit.)This movie marks the first teaming of actor Jimmy Stewart with director Anthony Mann
WINCHESTER '73 has been credited by some with revitalizing the western genre


 It was released in 1950, and is often cited as one of the first `adult' westerns

 It's also probably the first major western to feature a psychologically driven, complex and vulnerable lead character
 Stewart's Lin McAdam, along with trail pardner High-Spade Frankie Wilson (Millard Mitchell) has been tracking Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) for some time now, and finally, as the movie opens, Lin catches up with him in Dodge City

Unfortunately for Lin but good for the movie, Dodge City marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) doesn't allow shooting irons in his town - you can pick them up in the jail when you leave


 Lin and Dutch Henry can't do much more than growl and glower at each other, pausing only long enough to compete for the one-in-a-thousand Winchester '73


 Lin wins the competition, loses the gun shortly after, and Dutch Henry high-tails it out of there with purloined rifle in tow
 It's not the first time the rifle will change hands


(N.B

- It's not explained until the end why Lin McAdam is chasing Dutch Henry Brown, or why his desire for vengeance is so all consuming

 I've watched WINCHESTER '73 many times over the years, so the surprise ending hasn't been a surprise for a long time, but if you're able to avoid learning more than you need to about the Lin-Dutch Henry connection you're better off

 You'll likely figure it out for yourself before the movie reveals it to you.)The then young and fetching Shelly Winters plays Lola Manners, a dance hall `entertainer' who we first meet when Marshal Earp is escorting her to the outbound stagecoach
 Apparently, side arms weren't the only thing Earp didn't want going off in his peaceful little burg


 Like the wandering Winchester, Lin will cross paths with Lola a time or three before they roll the closing credits


 Veteran character actor Dan Duryea, here in prime slime mode, plays the outlaw Waco Johnnie Dean

 When Duryea is on like he is here you could add the `Wacko' nick to the front of his character's name


 With interesting, layered secondary characters like Lola Manners and Waco Johnnie Dean, WINCHESTER '73 opened up westerns to more complex themes and characterizations

 You could argue that without Lin McAdam we'd never have had Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name characters


 Even without its historical significance, though, it remains a great action story with a stellar cast

 Included in the cast, in minor speaking parts, is Tony Curtis as a young horse soldier and Rock Hudson as Indian chief Young Bull (okay, WINCHESTER '73 didn't make wholesale changes
 Native American roles were still, by in large, played by white actors.)The best feature on this disk is the commentary track, which features Paul Lindenschmidt speaking with and interviewing Jimmy Stewart for a laser disk release in 1989
 It's the only time Stewart ever contributed to a commentary track, and he's filled with anecdotes about the making of the movie, working with Anthony Mann, and his relationship with his beloved horse, Pie
 I would have recommended WINCHESTER '73 as an essential classic even without the commentary track
 The commentary track, and the excellent print, are just a couple of layers of platinum on a golden movie.

$review_text.: I've puzzled over &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; for a longtime trying to make sense of it.  Is it a satire on violence?  Is it acomment on the social attitudes toward violence?  Who knows?  Who cares?I can hardly believe that Quentin Tarantino wrote such an awful screeenplay, considering that I generally like his work. Perhaps it's the fault of Oliver Stone, fresh from having scored a huge miss with the bloated, incredibly poor &quot;JFK&quot;.This movie is simply unwatchable, a God-awful mess.  It is unclever and takes itself too seriously to be satire, so it must be social commentary.  Unfortunately, there are other movies which do a better job of making the point that this film tries to deliver, so it really doesn't break any new ground.  &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; falls flat as either a satire or a message film.The plot is thin, the premise is stupid, and the acting is marginal.  Fortunately, Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis should be able rise above what has to be one of the worst career choices they've ever made.  Kinda makes you wonder whether this is the movie that put Robert Downey Jr. over the edge.The bottom line is that &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; is a motion picture without a mission other than the glorification of gratuitous violence which has been done, and done better, by other films. I originally had my review entitled &quot;Second Worst Film of the 90's&quot;, but after careful reflection I have to say that my initial choice for worst film of the 90's, the overhyped and hackneyed &quot;Titanic&quot;, is better by comparison.

While hosting the Shalom House telethon, Marcy meets a sweet and handsome Jewish man named Eli, who works as an agent

Johnny begins paying an inordinate amount of attention to Marcy after Hunter convinces him that Marcy and Sarah Michelle are involved

Although he ignores Courtney's pleas that he confess the truth, he finally decides to come clean because he feels his pig has lost respect for him

$REVIEW.: They're back in black...and that's really all there is to this film


 It's a basic story that reunites Agent K with J to kill more aliens.The film is not completely without merit


 There are some good jokes and humorous scenes involved
 There is also a better array of special effects

 But at the same time, the goofiness and in-your-face style of the film takes on a more unbelievable edge.The characters are still well-developed and well enacted

 But the story is rather dull and offers little to the imagination (except for the ending locker sequence, but even that scene is bizzare and unbelievable).I consider the first Men In Black to be much better

 I found the sequel to be dull.

$review_text.: Every wrestling fan out there should know the impact that The Rock made on the business. The Rock was the first ever 3rd generation superstar and the first superstar to ever win the WWE championship 7 times. The Rock could possibably be the most charasmatic & entertaining superstar of all time.As far as for the DVD set goes, you will hear nothing from The Rock whatsoever. The narration is done by someone else but not by The Rock. You will also get nothing from other superstars either. The same as Tombstone: History of the Undertaker. The narrator goes through and discuss The Rock's Samoan heritage, his rise to fame and popularity, WWE title reigns, the connection with the fans and the hatred from the fans, and also feuds with Mankind, Triple H, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and others.DISC 1RAW 2.13.97Intercontinental TitleVs. Hunter Hearst Hemsley - The match told a pretty good inring story. It went at a good pace and the ending worked in very well. 4/5RAW 4.6.98Intercontinental TitleVs. Owen Hart - This match started out pretty good. It was getting better as it progressed but the disqualification by Chyna is what killed it. 3.75/5RAW 6.22.98King of the Ring Quarter-Finals MatchVs. Triple H - Much better match then the previous match between these two. It was more of a physical match. Both men looked pretty good. A very good match up. 4.5/5Survivor Series 11.15.98WWE TitleVs. Mankind - A very good match between these two here. Much better then their Rock Bottom encounter. Foley & Rock took some hard slams and hard shots on the outside. Foley even crashes through the announce table at one point in the match. A very good title match. 4.5/5St. Valentine's Day Massacre 2.14.99Last Man Standing Match/WWE TitleVs. Mankind - Not a bloody and violent match as their I Quit match was but still a very physical contest. A lot of hard shots taken in this one. 4.75/5RAW 2.15.99Ladder Match/WWE TitleVs. Mankind - These two just left off from where they were the night before. The only addition was the ladder. And to include a Rock Bottom through a table. And also a chokeslam from Big Show to Mankind from the top of the ladder. Another good bout from these two. 4.5/5Wrestlemania XVWWE TitleVs. Stone Cold Steve Austin - A very good first Wrestlemania encounter from these two. They added the no dq rule to the match which did add more to it. Pretty good match. Some good brawling on the outside and a good table spot. 4.75/5DISC 2RAW 7.5.99Steel Cage MatchVs. Triple H - Not a bloody cage bout but I felt this was an outstanding match. A very solid match up. 5/5RAW 8.30.99WWE Tag Team Titlesw/ Mankind Vs. Undertaker & Big Show - I wasn't really all too fond of this tag bout. Taker's role in this match seemed like he didn't care. And he would actually leave the match half way in. Leaving Big Show by himself. Then it became a 2 on 1 match. Not the best tag match in my view but watchable. 3.5/5Smackdown 12.30.99No Holds BarredVs. Kane - Not a lot of spots here. Except for a table spot and Kane being thrown off the stage. Still a good match to watch. 3.75/5Backlash 4.30.00WWE TitleVs. Triple H - Another good battle from these two. But it did get a little annoying with Vince at ringside and Shane as the special referee. It had a very impactive double rock bottom through the announce table to HHH and Shane. Special appearence from Stone Cold in this one. 4.75/5RAW 5.1.00Steel Cage Match/WWE TitleVs. Shane McMahon - I didn't really like this match at all. It was entertaining but all of the interfernce from the McMahons & Triple H was too cheesy for a steel cage match. But still a match to watch. 3.5/5No Way Out 2.25.01WWE TitleVs. Kurt Angle - I feel that their No Mercy match is way better but this match is still good and very worth seeing. Very intense also. A very good battle for the title. 4.75/5Summerslam 8.19.01WCW Heavyweight TitleVs. Booker T - This match was very high energetic. Phenomenal action in the ring and on the outside. Some good near falls and a great title match. Very good main event from Summerslam. 4.75/5Royal Rumble 1.20.02Undisputed TitleVs. Chris Jericho - I felt that this match was on the same level as their Vengeance bout. But didn't feel better then their match from No Mercy. A solid match with a good table spot. 4.5/5DISC 3Wrestlemania X8Vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan - An outstanding match and great to see the crowd go crazy during this match. The match was back and forth all the way. One of the greatest matches in Wrestlemania history. Rock kicks out of the Hogan leg drop and comes back to give Hogan two Rock Bottoms and then a People's Elbow to beat Hogan in Hogan's second Wrestlemania lost. 5/5Vengeance 7.21.02Undisputed TitleVs. Undertaker Vs. Kurt Angle - This was a tremendous triple threat bout. You nearly saw everything in this match. Awesome contest and a great showing from all three men. 5/5RAW 7.22.02Vs. Eddie Guerrero. - I enjoyed this match. Very entertaining and very good to watch. 4/5Wrestlemania XIXVs. Stone Cold Steve Austin - The match started very intense and fierce. It had some good brawling and hard shots on the outside. There were some very nice counters too. Rock works on Austin's leg briefly but not that whole much. The Rock hit some very hard impact Rock Bottoms to Austin in this one. Rock and Austin puts on a very good showing here. 4.5/5The Extra's are very good. They consist of many of The Rock's promos and one liners. I recommend this set. The matches that were picked out were very good and they all delivered for the majority. Again, this is a set that I recommend picking up someday.

$review_text.: I wasn't much of a fan of the first season of SG-1. It seemed deriviative and the writing was frequently weak. Given that it was the first season and the writers had yet to find their footing (a problem that dogged Star Trek: The Next Generation, Farscape, Babyon 5, Deep Space 9 and The Dead Zone as well). I decided to keep watching just in case it improved. It did. By the middle of the second season the characters were better written and the overall feel was that the producers knew where the series was going.By season 3 Sg-1 Began to hit its stride. Although the silly episodes (not in a good way--I'm referring to Spock's Brain silly here folks, i.e., incompetant) had given way to sharp writing, and some really strong performances particularly from Richard Dean Anderson.While this boxset could have more in the way of extras, it beats many of the other boxed sets simply because its affordably priced and well produced. The transfers vary from good to very good and the generaly sound quality is also strong. While there are still occasional clunkers mixed in with many of these gems, they are fewer and far between compared to season 1 and season 2.

$REVIEW.: I was warned that this movie was long and slow and boring and that I would hate it.  So I just yesterday rented it and watched it during the day to avoid getting too tired and I watched and I enjoyed, emensly.  This film is a great biopic standing tall with films like 'A Beautiful Mind' or 'The Insider'.  Leo does an amazing job portraying Hughes or so I've heard.  It's hard to judge the acting on this film form my perspective because I am too young to know how these people really were like, but I hear it's spot on, I mean with the oscar nods and Blanchett's win as Miss Hepburn you know the acting is up there.  I personally enjoy watching John C. Reilly act.  His portrayal of Noah Dietrich was great.  He just has a great presence.  The cameos by Stefani who played Jean Harlow and Jude Law who played Errol Flynn were great and the ever beautiful Kate Beckinsale in her performance as Ava Gardner was amazing.  Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda play the perfect villians and Alda (Senator Brewster) deserved that oscar.  I've never been a MASH fan but he nailed his performance here.  The court room scenes were my favorite in the film.  I do want to say that acting aside the direction this film took was better than say Ray took this year.  I felt that Scorsese did wonders with this movie, making everything feel like you were right there.  The sets were beautiful the colors were vibrant and the script was very well done.  This is a great movie and I'd recomend it to anyone with an interest in history, aviation, the art of movie making or someone who just wants to be entertained...this is your movie.

$review_text.: I watched this DVD that I had missed in theaters and when the DVD was launched, in the same week I read a thriller by John Philpin called "The Murder Channel"
 Both satirize crime and the media, and the strange fascination we residents of America have with Court TV, and getting our "15 minutes" of fame, even if it means we look ridiculous in the prospect

 Awaken this concept in the criminal mind, and the way that the media can steer the coverage of a horrific crime is really mind-boggling.As far as the film is concerned, I liked it
 Just that


 The premise was so good, that I should have been able to rate it more highly, but there were too many flaws in the film
 Very few of the flaws are connected with the DVD production, by Infinifilm, which continues to impress me with its features
 One feature we could have done without in this particular movie, however, was the music video!  It just didn't wash.Robert DeNiro plays Eddie Flemming, a famous big city detective (reality:  only detectives who screw up become famous) who allows a young arson investigator to attach himself to the investigation of a series of crimes that involve both murder & arson

 The investigator, Jordy Warsaw, is played by Ed Burns


 I liked Burns in the film, but didn't pick up on any real chemistry between the two men; and unfortunately DeNiro has two tracks:  drama, for which we all know he has a flair, and comedy (for which he is somewhat amusing)


 Unfortunately, he needs a third style to pull off a satire, and he almost plays this role as a comedy
 Not good enough for an actor that has wasted most of the last five years in forgettable roles.....The media crazed villains are a couple of screwup illegal immigrants, Emil & Oleg (Karl Roden & Oleg Taktarov), and they both pursue their obsessions (Emil's -- $$$ and fame through crime; and Karl's -- movie making with a hand-held mini cam in America) to the hilt

 They make the movie.There are some forgettable cameo roles - Vera Famigia is given virtually no good lines, but her unusual beauty lights up the screen, much like in her role on television, Kim Cattrall and Avery Brooks are talented, and not featured enough....Kelsey Grammar is forgettable, and should stick to the small screen, as he's proved over and over and over.I really enjoyed a humorous bit played by David Alan Grier as a petty criminal who bumps into DeNiro in a park, and takes revenge for his humiliation in the same way everyone else does....through the media!A little miscast, a little overlong, some jarring notes in a drama with an interesting premise, mishandled by a director

 Don't buy the DVD, rent it.

$REVIEW.: I was offered a free rental today, and casting around for something I had never seen before, I grabbed this one thinking it would be about how Nixon was outed from office, not actually assassinated.  I put it in on background as I struggled with creating the index to a 550 page new book, and within 15 minutes I stopped and the movie had my undivided attention.Sean Penn is perfect, deep, emotional, and inspires commitment to the movie and to his plight as a failure who is honest.  As I am a student of how "honest" governments are in fact a form of legalized organized crime, I may have appreciated this movie more than most, but I do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

Sid Halley is a star steeple chase rider who suffers a career-ending injury that ends his riding career and launches him into life as a private detective who specializes in all manner of race track mischief from bookies, to blackmailers, to murder. From top-notch acting, to spot on set designs, to a meticulous attention to Dick Francis' original story, "The Dick Francis Thriller: The Racing Game" provides a bit more than five hours of riveting entertainment and is especially recommended to Dick Francis fans, mystery buffs, and community library DVD collections!

$review_text.: Having seen the previews to this movie, I expected it to be just more Hollywood fluff.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this movie and by the sensitive acting by Nicholas Cage.  Cage is the quintissential career guy, caught up in the trappings of success, but sadly lacking human contacts.  Because he has no plans for Christmas Eve, he holds staff meetings on the holiday and doesn't seem to mind disrupting other people's lives.  Through a bit of fantasy, he is allowed to see how his life would have been if he had married his girlfriend 13 years previously instead of leaving her for a career move.  This is a heartwarming and thought provoking movie.

$review_text.: The Blu-ray rendition of the prequel trilogy isn't much to look at, to be honest. Most of the series was shot recently enough to where they were able to transfer it over to Blu-ray quality more smoothly, at least more than the original trilogy. Honestly, I might be spoiled by my PS3, which upscales the quality of my original Star Wars DVDs and after watching that, these did nothing for me at all....virtually little to no difference. So if you have an upscaling DVD player, I'd just stick to my original DVDs and make use of that, and save about $100 on the whole series.They changed a few things in this version, but most of it is not noticeable. Apparently, they tweak Star Wars more with every DVD release, and this one is no different...use Google or go to Wikipedia to see the full list of changes. The most glaring thing is they changed Yoda in Episode 1 from that pig-nosed puppet to the CGI version they used in Episodes 2 and 3, which just made the whole series more consistent...I didn't think it was detrimental at all, as I always wondered why Yoda has a pig nose in Episode 1 but it disappeared for the rest of the series. Every other "change" they made on the list was highly unnoticeable by me, and I've watched these films about 10+ times now.The biggest thing are the specials...but I think most people won't be watching those after the movie is over. If you're looking for the ultimate DVD collection for Star Wars....this isn't it. Don't  know what their plans are for the future, but I doubt this is the last Star Wars DVD release they'll put out, and I wouldn't be shocked to see a Special Edition version somewhere down the line. Either way, unless you're just dying to have these on Blu-ray discs, I think you can skip it, and see what the future holds.

$review_text.: JP: The Lost World is a strong sequel - as far as sequels go. Most No 2 movies fail or leave less excited than the first but this one really holds it's own.Leading the cast again is Jeff Goldblum who as an actor can speak the most technical dialogue as flawlessly as a bird singing. And, he does it with humor. He is a great actor to watch speak. Juliana Moore is an excited character in her own right and often is the perfect foil to Jeff nervous character.The young girl playing Jeff's daughter is just as funny - although I can tell not as experienced. Everyone else seems to pale against the story of the real stars of this film. The Dinosaurs.Technically the film is great. The attack of the T-Rex on the edge of the cliff sequence is brilliant. Spielberg does try and do one important thing and this to make his characters real and more importantly sympathetic to their environment. They are not just props spewing out lines. They interact with each other, the dinosaurs and the sets. They are not part of the background.The DVD extras on this one are good as well. Originally it came with a web link to JP III, but that film flopped big time. Now that was a waste of film even though Sam Neil tried to make an effort of it but the film lacked a lot.This is a good DVD for your collection. (But the first JP film is still the best!)

$review_text.: A talented cast languishes beneath an overly-obvious script and rather slack, uninspired direction.  T. Craig Nelson (of "Coach" fame) is the big surprise among the actors -- he brings a quiet power to his role as the patriarch of a diverse, free-thinking, multi-culti family somewhere in New England.  Other cast members include Dermot Mulroney (hunk, likeable), Luke Wilson (likeable, great comic timing), Sarah Jessica Parker (one-dimensional, not very interesting), Diane Keaton (not much depth to her character, little for her to work with), Claire Danes (omigod, she's so wonderful! Wish she had more to do here...) and Rachael McAdams (who?)Individually, most of the actors do fine work, but as an ensemble they seldom gel... I think this is mostly due to poor direction -- the large-group repartee looks and feels like all the lines were shot separately and strung together by the editor -- there's no flow to these sequences.  Scenes with just two actors in them are much more convincing.  The plot is so-so -- there are, perhaps, too many elements, encompassing gays and gay marriage, social friction between liberals and conservatives, romantic hijinks, and families having to deal with terminal illnesses such as breast cancer.  It was probably a very thoughtful, intelligent script that got reworked and mashed down by some Hollywood committee, and the end result just couldn't stand up to critical scrutiny.As it is, this is a mildly entertaining film, a good-natured, modern-day mash-up of George S. Kaufmann's "You Can't Take It With You" and "Holiday," though hardly with the same panache as those screwball classics. It has its moments, but you can definitely do better.

$REVIEW.: &quot;The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&quot; is Sergio Leone's ultimate spaghetti western with a plot centered on a gold treasure buried in a cemetary. It stars Clint Eastwood as the &quot;Man With No Name&quot; a gunfighter in the amoral/lawless American west who engages in actions that are not always legal, but never wrong. Naturally, Eastwood butts heads with Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef); a murderer without a conscience, and Tuco (Eli Wallach); a conflicted bandit who remains beyond redemption. Like most of Leone's great masterworks, visual style and long stretches of seemingly silent moments tell far more than any amount of dialogue could. Thus, the film is a rare example in which style is transformed into substance.THE TRANSFER: The previously issued DVD of this film was excessively troubled by age related artifacts and a non-anamorphic transfer. Although we have been given an enhanced 16X9 transfer this time - the age related artifacts are still present - if slightly tempered. Colors remain dated, though, unlike the previous incarnation, are not as faded. Many scenes remain softly focused with minimal grit and dirt. The Techniscope widescreen process (an absolutely inferior widescreen format)dillutes the film images. The &quot;restored&quot; scenes are not terribly well integrated into the film. At one point the entire image turns jaundice yellow, which is obtrusive to say the least! Fine details and definition are sometimes poorly rendered, that its best to say that this visual presentation is true to its shoddy original film stock. The audio has been remixed to 5.1 but is nevertheless strident and very unnatural sounding.EXTRAS: Audio commentary that is very informative, and several fine documentaries about Leone, the film's composer -Ennio Morricone, the civil war and the Leone's style. Also, some deleted scenes.BOTTOM LINE: This is by far the best that the film has looked on any home video format. But the improvements, while substantial, still do not bring the video quality of this presentation up to par with films of the same or similar vintage.

$review_text.: This largely excellent film relates the true story of what happened in tne Nazi-occupied former eastern Polish city of Lvov when the Germans decide to empty the Jewish ghetto in 1943. A group of Jews breaks into the sewers from the basement of their building and the first person they meet is Polish sewer inspector Leopold Socha (wonderfully portrayed by Robert Wieckiewicz), who agrees to protect them in return for money. He leads the group to a stinking underground cellar where they must deal with the dark, the filth, numerous rats and boredom as well as the stress of knowing they could be betrayed at any point. Socha extorts a high price from the group and fires off anti-Semitic insults when they complain about their plight. People in the film variously speak Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, German and Yiddish, reflecting just how uneasily mixed together the population was. Socha relies for protection on a revolting Ukrainian colonel, a rabid Jew-hater who thinks the Nazis are the best thing to ever happen to the city. Socha has to remain friendly enough with the colonel to stay safe while distracting the officer as he hunts the refugees he knows must be hiding underground somewhere. The colonel's men and the Nazis are casually brutal and think nothing of executing (or threatening to execute) anyone who is in the slightest bit inconvenient. At one stage Socha tells the group he is fed up with their whining and will desert them, since his double life is becoming too dangerous. Gradually though he starts to consider the Jews as people he must protect and keeps on feeding and protecting them, even when their money runs out.The film though is partly let down by a script that verges on the simplistic. At the start of the film Socha's wife tells him that Jews are good people who deserve to be treated as well as anyone else - this at a time when Poles' attitudes towards the large Jewish population were complex and conflicted, to say the very least. In the cellar, one of the escapees says German troops will die in Stalingrad, even though the battle had ended months before the ghetto was emptied. At the very end, when the survivors emerge from the sewers and blink at the son, Socha's wife turns up with a cake to celebrate their survival and you'd think you were watching a birthday party. Odd moments like this detract from but fortunately do not undermine a powerful film.

$review_text.: *** This review may contain spoilers ***'Celeste and Jesse Forever' is a witty comedy about an ex-couple who are still best friends and seemingly have everything in common together, but are on the verge of getting divorced. When we first meet Celeste and Jesse, played by the talented Rashida Jones (who was a co-writer of the screenplay) and Andy Samberg (of Saturday Night Live fame), it's evident that both these actors have tremendous chemistry together. Their best friends walk out on them at a restaurant because they can't believe that they're getting divorced, when they seem to be so in synch with one another. The couple does their 'shtick' together, adopting simultaneous mock German accents and simulating masturbation with a lip balm.Why is it that Jesse and Celeste are getting divorced, since they seem so compatible? Well, Celeste, an extremely successful 'trend forecaster' and cable news commentator, looks down on Jesse's lack of ambition; he's an aspiring artist who's taken freelance assignments, but really not making much money at all.I was expecting the plot to go in the direction of the couple drifting apart but eventually reconciling. But the story becomes something entirely different when Jesse reveals that a fling he had with old friend Veronica, a few months before, results in her becoming pregnant. Jesse decides to try and make things work with Veronica and Celeste must now cope with that new reality. Samberg virtually drops out of the film for a good part of the second Act, with everything now focusing on Jones, who plays Celeste as a young woman who is unable to have that one epiphany which will lead to self-discovery. When Jesse does interact with Celeste, the witty banter is gone, and ultimately he decides to throw his lot in with Veronica, a complete cipher of a character.Meanwhile, there are a succession of 'loser dates' Celeste goes on which don't quite make the grade in the comedy department. Much better is the Yoga Guy (Paul) who Celeste eventually ends up with. Fortunately Jones has just as much chemistry with Chris Messina who plays Paul as with Samberg. There's also a humorous sub-plot with Riley, a pop star, who Celeste ends up bonding with, despite a marketing gaffe with a gay theme.'Celeste and Jesse Forever' morphs into a tale of a young woman who must finally give up her arrogance in order to have a successful relationship. There's quite a bit of wit in the writing here but when things get 'serious' (after things sour between the once compatible couple), the film isn't quite as successful. 'Celeste and Jesse Forever' is mainly worth seeing for the chemistry between the principals (in the early part of the film), witty dialogue and some of the sub-plots that keep the story moving.
$SUMMARY.: Witty dialogue and good performances save weak narrative of dissolution of once compatible couple

$REVIEW.: Some 3-4 years ago, director Martin McDonagh teamed up with Colin Farrell in an absurd but very funny crime comedy called "In Bruges"
I loved that movie (and not just because it was filmed in the Belgian city of Bruges, where I spent my high school years)
Now comes another crime comedy from the same team."Seven Psychopaths" (2012 release; 110 min.) brings the story of Marty (played by Farrell), a struggling writer who is working on a movie script called "Seven Psychopaths"


His buddy Billy (played by Sam Rockwell) is volunteering to help in any way possible

At some point Billy steals a little dog, and only later do we learn that the dog's owner is Charlie (played by Woody Harrelson), a dangerous gangster who is out for revenge

Last, but certainly not least, there is Hans (played by Christopher Walken), a buddy of Billy's

There are a bunch of smaller characters in the movie


To be honest, I had a hard time keeping track of the multitude of characters, and the fact that part of the movie is a recreation of the script that Marty is writing

A script within the script, so to speak

After a while I simply let go of it all, and just watched the movie for what it is, regardless of the actual or percieved plot lines: another absurd (and I do mean that as a compliment) crime drama.Couple of side comments: with apologies to Colin Farrell, but in my opinion Sam Rockwell steals the movie

His acting is sharp and he brings his character in a way that made me smile if not laugh out loud, just by seeing him


I also was surprised to see that this movie is not just playing at the art house here in Cincinnati (where I saw it), but also at a number of mainstream mulitplexes
The movie was not very well attended when I saw it this past weekend, and I can't imnagine that a dark and violent movie like this one, even with plenty of humor and comedy, will be a big hit, but I could be wrong of course

Bottom line is this: if you liked "In Bruges", which in style and approach is very similar to this one, you will love "Seven Psychopaths"


If you found that "In Bruges" was not your cup of tea, save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this.


$SUMMARY.: If you liked "In Bruges", you'll love this one

The story line is humorous, while at the same time showing young children that you can be friends with anyone that is different as long as you try to understand them. The ending is very touching and brings a tear to the eye and a smile on the face. I found that the best part of this movie is the little prehistoric squirrel. What a cute little fella. Ha, ha!!!!

$review_text.: Jean Yanne (french cinematographer/writer/actor, now living in California) made the only pun I know which can be translated in about 10 languages -and understood around the world-: &quot;As well the smallest unit in length is the millimeter, as well the smallest unit in weight is the milligram, as well the smallest unit in intelligence is the military.Boris Vian, another french cinematographer/writer/musician (d. 1958), said the only way to get rid of military people would be to gather them on a very large meeting place rigged to be blown up, but also said there would still be a problem: getting rid of the one(s) in charge of the fuse.If this movie was shown in every school to every kid 13/16 old, anyone wanting afterwards to join the army for the fun of it (or even for the glory) should be categorized as a very sick jerk and get cold showers in a straight-jacket for at least 5 years, and, if not cured, be used as compost.I saw this movie when it was released in Paris in 1960 (I was 16), and have since recommended it relentlessly as the 1st war movie to be watched, since it's the only one I've seen which unmasks in the most accurate way the insanity/irresponsibility of trigger-happy warmongers, as well as irresponsible manipulation of young minds by people who should not be in charge of anything, not even themselves.

$REVIEW.: &quot;Yes, yes, we did make a difference.&quot;Those are some of the  last words in this movie. You would know who said them and why, if you saw  the movie. If you didn't, I pity you. This is the best ST movie ever.  Besides The Search For Spock.It's about a mad scientist called Dr.  Tolian Soren (Malcolm McDowel who does a brilliant performance) who wants  to return to a place called the Nexus. It is place were dreams become  realities, those who go there never want to leave. In order to do that he  must make the gatway to the Nexus (An energy ribbon)come to him by  destroying stars. Because any other way results in catastrophe.The movie  starts when Kirk is swept away in the Nexus on a rescue mission with the  Enterprise-B. Later Picard and company find out about Soran's plans but  fail. The Enterprise-D is destroyed and Soran and Picard are swept into the  Nexus. Picard finds Kirk to help him and they go back in time for a final  showdown against Soran. Who wins? You'll have to find out when you watch  the movie. Data also uses his emotion chip for the first time.The best  parts in the movie are the parts with Data and Guinan and the scenes in the  Nexus.I give it *Blows out five birthday candles for no apparent reason  but to do so* FIVE STARS!!!

$REVIEW.: This is a mordant, darkly comic tale of obsession spanning three generations. Captivating in its grossness, this is definitely not one for the squeamish. It's difficult to divine exactly what this movie is supposed to tell us, if it's attempting to tell us anything at all. The characters are uniformly grotesque, the plot is slight, and any possible meaning is distinctly nebulous. Palfi appeals to the viewer's voyeuristic tendencies and, it has to be said, not much else. But as a study of bodily compulsions it's interesting enough.

$review_text.: Dog Day afternoon is one of those films that define 70's films. That was a great decade for Pacino. With the exception of Brando, I can't think of an actor putting together 4 great iconic films in a single decade as Pacino did with Serpico, Godfathers 1 and 2, and this film.Dog Day follows the events that took place in a bungled Brooklyn bank robbery in 1975. On that day, a couple of unemployed losers became celebrities on live television. The film shows how easily one can go from being a schmuck to a god by pandering to the people. As Sonny, Pacino used one word to go from an armed criminal to a superstar: Attica. Pacino's performance is very tense in this film in that it's not a glamorous performance. He looks and sounds scared, frantic, and desperate as you'd expect anybody to be in that situation.This isn't what I'd consider a good-looking film as far as it looking like a Hollywood film. It has that same grainy real-world look to it as a film like the French Connection or even On The Waterfront. This film was about the actors themselves. A lot of close up shots of their faces and eyes. Charles Durning was excellent in here as the police lieutenant involved in most of the negotiations with Pacino and his parter, Sal, played by the late great John Cazale who played Freddie in the Godfather films.Other great roles in this film include the FBI man (Mulvaney), and a very young Lance Henrickson who played Bishop in the Alien films.This film runs a little over 2 hours but there's so much going on that you'll hardly notice the time. A great example of 70's filmmaking and of what made Pacino the star he is today.

$REVIEW.: I am a big admirer of John Carpenter, and a huge fan of Halloween, the Prince of Darkness (one of the most underrated horror movies ever) and The Thing
Even his oh-not-so-successful entries, like Stephen King's Christine and The Fog are quite watchable, particularly Christine boosted by Carpenter's ominious music pieces.So I have always dreamt that They Live would be another bleak horrorfest with creatures creating a havoc and a nightmare
Instead I found an shoot-them-up-all driven tongue-in-the-cheek movie

Not happy.The film starts as if it were a sequel to the Prince of Darkness with a similar slightly ominious soundtrack, a small church in a forgotten part of the city
Then it goes on for 45 minutes without nothing

After the sunglass is worn, things start to get going, but I found the leading character's reaction to what he saw very unconvincing
Instead of being horrified, scared, trying to get himself disguised and absorb the siutation to work out a plan, he makes himself conspicious all the way and tries to annihilate some of the creatures with the subtlety of an orangutan

Here we see that the leading character is the US version of Bruce Lee and Terminator
Not very believable.Moreover, there is a fight scene that takes ages to come to an end

My advice is that as soon as  two leading characters start to fight over about wearing the special sunglass, just press fast forward button and jump to the point where Keith David wears the sunglasses finally

You will lose nothing on the way; instead you will gain ten precious minutes.The acting is very wooden
"Holly" character must be one of the most soulless woman characters of all time (no wonder the actress has never starred in a major production) The first 45 minutes is exruciatingly slow and after it the film picks up and starts to take itself more seriously and somehow become a little bit ominious.The ending was good: Satisfactory.There is a story by Stephen King called Ten O'Clock Peaple in his third story collection Nightmares and Dreamscapes


I don't know which one came first but that story and this movie is very parallel in subject matter but Stephen King's story is really a freight train
I heard rumours that it is now planned as a movie
I hope it tackles the story much better than this one.See it but with lowered expectations.

$review_text.: Well, first of all the viewers of this movie should not take it seriously.  It's not that type of movie. Its more of a campy/spunky type action film.  Yeah, it is a lot like Indiana Jones, and isn't Van Dammes best, but still has many high points to it. If you want Van Dammes best acting DON'T start here; go watch In Hell, Wake of Death, Lionheart, or maybe Timecop for that.  For his action/martial arts skills this isn't a bad place to go.  It has quite a few good action scenes in it. Van Damme is always cool as hell and has some good lines.  The ending is also pretty good as well. With the ending you get Van Dammes best kick(jumps and glides) out of all his movies he has ever done, even at his older age. The movie as a whole isn't nowhere near as bad as a lot of people think. It's just another action film that Van Damme fans and MAYBE action fans should love.  But like I said its NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

$review_text.: Unstoppable - Review of the final Tony Scott FilmTo put it bluntly, if Unstoppable were filmed by any other director the result would have been abysmal
Tony Scott draws upon his 20 plus years of directing to take this project to the big screen

His demanding requirements of what goes into his films, his use of camera angles and wide angle shots, the lack of any unnecessary CGI to give the viewer that sense of up close realism that has been absent in most films since the late 90's, make Unstoppable a movie to enjoy, not debate who's going to get the Oscar for this or that.No one's winning any races or defending the friendly skies over the Atlantic, you're not going to hear bullets whizzing past you or someone yelling from the submarine command center "Dive! Dive! Dive!" 


You won't find any catchy one-liners either

The action is more controlled, centered, human
It's a reality movie but with all the appeal of a big budget action movie.The villain isn't a corrupt Big Brother watching from above in high definition, the villain isn't even a person, it's an unstoppable force with a mind of its own: a multi million pound train

Unstoppable is a true roller coaster ride all the way

It has character from Denzel Washington giving his 5th and final appearance in Scott's film legacy since 1995's Crimson Tide and Chris Pine teaming up with a very believable performance


They're the heroes of Unstoppable as they're top billed, but they're not supermen

They don't perform any miracle maneuvers in mid air while emptying two clips and reloading before hitting the ground


They're saving the day by doing what their characters were meant to do: their jobs

The film is based on real events and it's not going to bend reality so much as to have your head in a knot
You understand the characters, you can relate, you know their weaknesses and they're played against them to overcome not just the main obstacle but their own evils.Unstoppable is a film that shows you everyday people going beyond their required duty to save the day


One of the best parts in the film is when they're told not to do anything and even threatened to be fired if they don't stop what they're doing

The antagonistic CEO asks him why he would risk his life when he's three weeks from retirement and it doesn't really hit you what this movie was about until then.Forget about someone doing the impossible and nick of the moment acrobatics that get most movie goers raving and drooling for endless action and violence that is prevalent in most movies, this feature has none of it
It's about someone doing what they can because they were never asked to and because they know they must

Unstoppable was believable
Tony Scott gave us a final film from the heart, not something that will go down as the highest grossing blockbuster of all time, but as a true character piece, a visually captive approach to filmmaking and an inspiration to anyone out there who wonders what true heroes are.They're not men of steel and dressed in capes, they're the ones who never give a thought to their own safety before diving in head first and ensuring someone else's and they could just as likely be you or me

And when they finally save the day you feel great, emotional, enriched with appreciation for these average Joes that remind us of Uncle Jack that used to work for Union Pacific for 25 years or maybe that friend of Steve who went out of his way that time back in '89 and saved some folks from harm


It gets you right in the heart and sticks.Unstoppable is the last of Tony Scott's films and it rests comfortably at the end of his credits

He mentions in the special features that he's really making the same movie over and over each time, each time a little different but in a lot of ways they're the same, crafted from the same piece of clay or block of ice


I think I know what he means


He left his heart and soul in them and if you want to know what Tony Scott was all about, just give one of his films a try.Final ThoughtsSo we're left with a mystery as to why he took his life and it's likely that we'll never know the reason

I only hope he was satisfied with his work because I know I really enjoyed his movies over the years


I remember Top Gun and Days of Thunder the most
What I think I like the most about his films is how many times I can re-watch them and enjoy them the same each time
A lot of his films are that way

They had it all
He didn't make spectacular movies, he made great movies
The ones you can just watch for fun."Tower, this is Ghost Rider requesting a flyby


Negative, Ghost Rider, the pattern is full."

$REVIEW.: As one would expect, season 1 of Deep Space Nine is the weakest of the show's run.  Many of the characteristics that would make the show so great - extensive character development, plot arcs, a large set of secondary characters, and rich inter-character relationships - are already here in embryonic forms.  That said, it's also pretty clear that the writers haven't figured out what the show is about, aside from "Star Fleet on a Space Station."That means that we get plenty of 2nd-tier (and a few 3rd-tier) filler episodes.  It's certainly better than TNG's first season, which at times was quite painful to watch.  (To be fair, DS9 had the benefit of experience.)  Per my reference to "Star Fleet on a Space Station", we get plenty of throwaway episodes that could have easily occurred aboard the Enterprise.  There's also a reflex toward special appearances by minor TNG characters, generally with mediocre results.That said, a few episodes make this season worth watching - especially the last two, which are worthy of mention along highlights from season to come.  "Duet" is a classic, and "In the Words of the Prophets" is the kind of thoughtful, exciting arc episode that would eventually characterize the show.A casual fan could probably skip at least half of the 20 episodes on this set, but make sure you watch the rest.

$REVIEW.: The striking tone in the movie was Julia Robert's vicious personality. You could not help but believe that was her own biography, or the same replicated lifestyle of women getting lost in the underworld of acting to please others. The movie narrates the trauma inflicted on actors when acting stops and real living begins. Jane Fonda moved to France, sought spirit in India, peace in Vietnam, but at the end, Fonda ruined every thing in her life to return to the madness of Hollywood. When Hollywood has no need for a senile Fonda. Julia Roberts trailed Fonda in her agonizing loneliness.The eating part was disturbing as well. The Robert must travel to the carbohydrate kitchens of Italy to enjoy the lazy and purposeless life of Italians. In Italy, every one eats, talks, and sleeps. The movie displayed three scenes of the disgusting tradition of poking passerbys in their rear ends by locals with impunity. The assaulted targets have no option but to express anger and disdain, to no avail.Praying in India sounded odd also since all outsiders have no clue what they were reading, hearing, or doing. Intensive course in spirituality did little to reverse Hollywood's deep seated demons. India's spiritual setting sounded like self punishment by isolation and preoccupation as an escape from one's own vices. In comparison to the fat, lazy, and uncivil Italians, the Indians ate less and bothered no foreigner.Love was also missing all along. In America, the writer (Julia Robert) admits to have spent all her life between guys. In Italy, most women were fat, happy, senile, but married for eternity. India was entirely love-free, and spirit-rich. In Bali, love was of the American brand, induced by liquor, dancing, and physical attraction minus chemistry or character.Walking out of the movie, one could not resist the obnoxious and self absorbed role of Julia Robert contrasted with the laid back Italian women whose common sense belongs to the dark ages.

$review_text.: ECW's first commercially-released video is a collection of classic matches hosted by the "voice of ECW", Joey Styles. Included on this video are never-before-seen matches like the Raven-Sandman barbed wire match and a tag team title match featuring The Dudleys that was considered "too graphic for TNN". There's also pay-per-view matches like the classic Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn rematch from "Hardcore Heaven" and Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome at the 1999 "November To Remember". There's also a mixed tag match featuring ECW beauties Francine and Beulah with their respective partners, Shane Douglas and Tommy Dreamer. While this video is billed as being the "best of ECW", there are a lot of great matches and moments that didn't make the cut while average matches like the slightly dissapointing and extremly overhyped main event from "Barely Legal" between Taz and Sabu are included. It's a good collection but with so much great action in the ECW video library, they could have put together a better show for their first commercial video. The DVD has some added moments and a special preview of Acclaim's "Anarchy Rulz" video game.

$REVIEW.: The violence in this movie (including sexual violence) overshadows many valuable elements of the film


 The themes could have been conveyed and the characters could have been developed without showing every graphic detail of gore.We are, of course, supposed to learn that life during the Civil War, especially in the South, was horrific

 Depravity was rampant


 People turned against their friends and neighbors


 When the patriotic, well meaning, men were out fighting in the war, their families faced great peril at the hands of the enemy from the North and the enemies from next door


 Furthermore, the evils of American slavery had weakened Southern society accross the generations

This made it that much easier to translate anger and fear into violence and murder
 People did whatever they thought would help them to survive, and their methods were often cruel and animalistic.So, I got it

 The messages of the movie are clear


 The story is  riveting

 The characters are deep and fascinating
 The acting is superb


 So, why lean on the crutch of graphically portrayed carnage?  In 1939, "Gone With the Wind" (GWTW)was able to convey the horror of the time without displaying minute by minute violence


 There is a reason that, 65 years later, GWTW is still one of the best movies in existence
 I doubt that "Cold Mountain" will come close to standing the test of time.This is a disturbing movie that should be avoided by children and sensitive viewers.

$review_text.: There is a time and a place for POPCORN MOVIES. There is a time and a place to just let it all hang out and destroy and explode and dazzle... TRANSFORMERS was it.Apparently I'm too old to have been into TRANSFORMERS when I was a kid, but I'm still a kid at heart and I can slide back into imagination land pretty easily. Yet, it was made much easier by the competent story telling and slam bam effects orchestrated by Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg.First of all. I'm not a Michael Bay fan. His seizure inducing ARMAGEDON was the first sign of a director who was way too full of himself. He made the movie with not a single shot in the entire film that lasted longer than 5 seconds. It was too spastic, MTVish and had a style to it that took you right out of the reality of it, and made you think you were watching one big 2 hour commercial. You give the man a script... and he'll cut it in half and insert multiple explosions... most highly ridiculous and unrealistic... as was the case with THE ISLAND.I could go on and on about why Michael Bay is one of my least favorite directors... I mean, how can you take a silver platter story like PEARL HARBOR and make it into a storyless popcorn movie?Yet, now we have TRANSFORMERS. Sure, all the Michael Bay patents are present... the constant DAWN skyline that is present in nearly all of his films, the exploding buildings, flying granite, spastic editing... at times... yet, for some reason... it worked here. It worked in an unrealistic world scenario. It worked in a movie that had you watching cars, trucks, motorcycles and cell phones that turn into robots.... or visa versa.Throw in a solid performance by Shia LeBeouf and a decent performance by Megan Fox in her first BIG SCREEN MOVIE role... well... maybe she just looked good. Then add some good hearted fun from a robot/car named Bumble-Bee. Not to mention, a pheasible personal connection between the 3 of them.Huh? Michael Bay's style may have finally suited something properly. TRANSFORMERS is plain and simple, sheer fun and action. Strangely enough, Michael Bay managed to keep a solid storyline throughout the film to boot. It's well worth the ride and something that will be remembered and rewatched for a long time... unlike most popcorn movies.

$REVIEW.: Terebithia was a magical land which took shape after Leslie Burke moved to yet another school where she didn't fit in. Prettier than the popular cheerleaders, but too different to be accepted, she'd had to live in a fantasy world all ehr own as no one had ever had the time to listen. She was harassed by the nasty girls who would turn into people like the agitator at the last movie. She observed that her neighbor was treated badly by the bullies on the playground and on their school bus. She sat beside him so they'd leave him alone.There's nothing like first love as they transformed an old tree house out in the woods into a magical kingdom of which Leslie was the leader. Both ran like Forrest Gump as they departed the real world of violence on the school bus. The bridge was a hanging rope which they used a la Tarzan on his jungle vines. I wondered how the dog PT got across the flooded creek.As time went by, they became good friends but one day he took a field trip to a museum in the city without letting Leslie know. It was an unexpected treat, an opportunity he could not turn down. Though they were now close emotionally, he kept the trip secret like males tend to do, and he wasn't there when fate played its dirty trick.The founder of Terebithia went alone to their playground but the "bridge" broke. Jess felt guilty because he'd been too selfish to invite her along. Had fate been different, he would have taken her to the museum to show off his knowledge and experience. The oen time he wasn't there at a critical moment, she slipped and drown; when Zach took us to see the circus in Huntsville, Alabama, a friend of mine slipped away into oblivion and her mean daughter pulled the plug. Jess went into denial and missed her constantly. She'd been his sunshine and inspiration, and he just could not "let go."When an unexpected death hits us, it helps to remembe the good about the person who now is gone. My tribute to Bob Lobertine prompted by a callous state trooper's critical remark -- a letter to the Nashville Tennessean saying we should remember the good about a prominent person and let the bad die with him. Hold on to your loved one's specialness to keep it alive. The music throughout was delightful, shades of Star Wars (soundtrack is out and is fantastic).

$review_text.: "Troy" was a fun action flick that focused on Achilles.  His personality was softened, and he has a romance (that being essential to modern war-movies).  On the whole, the plot was true to the theme "the fall of Troy".  Many different people were well developped.  The fight between Achilles and Hector is the best done fight I've ever seen in a movie -- truly, the whole thing is worth seeing just for that.  Helene appears beautiful, just as she ought.  The director did an excellent job, and no expense was spared on the sets.  To my fellow ladies, let me say that there are plenty of handsome young men to admire.  All told, I can sympathise with those of you who loved this movie.However.  "Troy" was long, a bit slow, and went to rediculous extremes to avoid nudity.  The script writers took one of the greatest tragedies ever written and turned it into a decent war movie with an ending that was almost happy.  What is the point in seeing a Greek tragedy without the tragedy?  In my opinion, way too much care was taken not to offend the viewer's sensibilities, thus loosing the essiantial flavor.  Also, the romance between Helene and Paris was too bland -- this is supposed to be one of history's most famous romances, but the actors didn't do a convincing job of acting passionately in love.  For example, Helene's distress over her marriage and the war to get her back were all well portrayed, but she didn't appear affectionate toward Paris.So, in summary, I enjoyed "Troy" and would recommend this movie to you, but personally I wanted something slightly different.

$REVIEW.: Though that is somewhat of a wide opinion of reviewers on this web-site.  But it is true.  Joel Schulmacher was woefully misguided when he agreed to take up the directing reins from Tim Burton.  But the catoon show rose to the occasion, with the richly inspired &quot;Mask of the Phantasm,&quot; which delved deep into the noir and physclogical depths of the dark knight, without letting up on pacing or the films' central mystery.  &quot;Sub-Zero&quot; doesn't quite reach the heights of &quot;Phantasm,&quot; but it is more than a worthy successor to it.  One advancement on display in &quot;Zero&quot; is the fluid combination of computer and traditional animation.  The action set-pieces with Robin trying to chase down Mr. Freeze on a crowded highway and the climax abord an abandoned oil-rig are quite impressive.  However, experienced animated Batman director Boyd Kirkland never allows the animation and effects to impeed the fluid, air-tight plotting or the character interaction and development, which are things Kirkland and his team of animators, editors and voice-actors do consistently and satisfyingly well.Plot: Batman, Robin and Batwoman, alwalys with their hands full, now have to contend with Mr. Freeze, who has found fresh determination in fighting the heroes and in searching for a cure for his very ill wife, whose condition is getting steadily worse.  She needs a transplant, but her blood-type is so rare that searching for a donar is proving near impossible.  And to complicate things, if a living person became a donar, that person would die.  But Mr. Freeze is hell-bent on saving his wife.  In the comics and various t.v., Mr. Freeze was always the most sympathetic anatagonist towards Batman and his cohorts.  In &quot;Sub-Zero,&quot; one cannot but feel sorry for him.  He has searched feverishly for his wifes' cure, became his sub-zero state in the process and now it may all be in vain.It is the combination of smart plotting, swift-pacing and solid animation that make &quot;Sub-Zero&quot; memorable.  The cartoon show has outdone Joel Schulmacher and his disappointing attempts to make Batman come to the screen.  He is in need of what the cartoon and Tim Burton had I abundance:  Storytelling, character development and sensible villians.  But until someone revitalizes the Live-Action Batman (if they ever do), I am wholly content with the effort being put out by the cartoon show and the movies.

$REVIEW.: I first saw this on TV, and decided to order it


The language must have been cleaned up for TV, because I was shocked at the use of bad language (four letter words) in this movie


Otherwise, it is an uplifting movie about a main character who is Christian

Instead of totally ridiculing Christians as most films do, this one shows the importance of faith in one's life

I would have given this five stars if not for the vulgar language
I was surprised at the ending, and love the song, "Cry", which is played during the rolling credits

My daughter heard this song years ago, and performs it well, singing and playing guitar.

This is not working and Eisner need to get that through his stupid, ugly, deformed, thick head. Now onto the review. Despite the PG rating, little kids wouldn't be able to understand the hidden adult jokes like when Tim Allen tells the little 10 year old elf girl &quot;you look good for your age.&quot; I believe this is rather unusual but what's more unusual is every elf in the movie are little kids working at Santa's workshop. I don't know if anyone's noticed, but this is rather similiar to child labor. Another thing, why does Disney promote Santa so much? Don't tell me because it's Christmas, I know that. What I do know is there are more things to Christmas and Disney is making it look like it's all about Santa.

The greatest dangers he faces are not the terrorists but his boss, a gung-ho glory jockey played by Russell Crowe, and Crowe's rival for the command post, a stereotypical brain-dead but obstinately arrogant bureaucrat that the civil services breed like rats


No matter what happens, it is only a matter of time before DiCaprio gets screwed.DiCaprio wants to establish trust with the anti-terror unit he works with, so he can eventually nail the top terrorists

 But Crowe is too impatient, and will take any risk, abuse any relationship and burn any asset for a quick result that he can show off to the big boss to boost his career, even if it means getting his own agents killed.It is a very revealing look at how a US agency works, very realistic and a great eye-opener
But the plot gets muddled and the ending is a bit anti-climatic.

$REVIEW.: Let's face it, if you are picking up "It Waits", you aren't looking for a well acted, plot driven film

Most likely you are hoping for a standard "creature feature", maybe some blood, maybe a nifty rubber & latex creature out to cause mayhem and maybe a little suspense thrown in

If that is what you are looking for, then "It Waits" fits the bill

Cerina Vincent is quietly becoming a fun Scream Queen to look for


She provides a nice little perfomance here, not relying on her...ummm assets...to carry her scenes


This time around Cerina Vincent plays a US Forest Ranger hunted by "something" that has been awakened by some pesky college archeologists


I'm not sure what the "something" is, the Indian professor who conveniently shows up two-thirds of the way through the flick to give us that handy info, isn't too clear, and he isn't really around long enough to give further explanation or clarify


That's okay though, I don't need too much back-story, and I'm not really looking for plausability in a flick called "It Waits" either

Just get the creature out there hunting the campers quickly and I'm happy.The only real downside to the film was the lack of victims

I would have preferred this thing get a few more kills in before setting it's sights on Cerina and company


Just a few odds and ends campers, folks lost in the mountains, a small hillbilly community


The low body count was a drawback for me.On the plus side, "It Waits" features mostly old school special effects

I'm sick of CGI monsters, and it was nice to see a genuine "guy in a rubber suit" creature

It's old school fun


The blood, while not very heavy, is effectively spilled when done as well.If you are looking for genuine scares, maybe you should pass on "It Waits" for something else, but if you just want a fun Saturday late night creature feature flick, then give this one a shot.

I bet many young impressionable minds remain seared by this classic movie, with its matter-of-fact violence and liberal use of the n-word. Phil Karlson's direction is direct, unadorned and absolutely riveting.But I come today to praise the performance of Edward Andrews (playing here without his eyeglasses) who is the heavy here, an uncommon role for him.  His combination of aw-shucks friendliness coupled with gut-bucket brutality makes for an absolutely towering performance. It is impossible to take your eyes off Andrews, so complete is his domination of this film.Some other Amazon reviewer pronounced this movie "boring". I bet you never actually watched it, did you?

They use Cam's dad's 1961 Ferrari, which his dad likes more than his family. However, Ferris' sister Jeannie doesn't buy it, and his principal Ed Rooney chases him like a hungry hound dog; Bueller is one absence away from repeating his senior year, so Rooney would like to have that happen. Meanwhile, the trio joyrides all over Chicago in the priceless car, eating at expensive restaurants, seeing priceless art, attending Cubs games, and the finisher: Ferris sings two classic 60s songs in a parade in front of thousands. Later, Cameron wrecks the Ferrari and is slowly gaining self esteem. Then Ferris is almost exposed by Rooney, but his sister bails him out, of all people. The lesson in this movie, as Ferris puts it: Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop to look around once in a while, you could miss it.

While I'm sure the truth is somewhere in the middle, it is very enjoyable to see things from the veiwpoint of the forensic scientist.I have very few complaints from this season, it was solid from episode 1 to episode 23.  The crimes vary greatly, and although I'm sure that by now the show has had a few retreads, the first season is very diverse and original, although some trends develop (It always seems to be an inside job or a family member).  The characters are very well drawn out and are often humorous, but not like the constantly wise-cracking detectives in Law & Order; these men and women take their jobs seriously.I heartily reccomend the first season of CSI, although the price tag may seem a tad steep, if you average it out you're only paying about 3 bucks an episode.  9/10

$review_text.: I wasn't going to immediately jump on the bandwagon of all the people who complained about the last season of Dexter, but I'm finally watching it, and it is so bad. Where did they find these writers? The rejects from Smallville? So slow-moving, and awful dialogue. I just keep wondering when it's over. Has any other show ever tapered off so badly? It was so great the first 3 or 4 years. John Lithgow, Jimmy Smits, Colin Hanks, all great characters besides the main cast. Now I just want it to be over for their sakes. And did anyone else get tired of Dexter's dad popping up with his bad advice? Hey Pops, shut your piehole and go haunt Charlie Manson in the slammer.

$REVIEW.: STIGMATA is an erotically crafted tale of suspense. I suppose it can be classified as a close cousin to the genre that brought us THE EXORCIST yet looks visually closer to DON'T LOOK NOW. Gabriel Byrne once again delivers a lethargically quintessential performance as a priest who dutifully fulfills his assignments ordered by arbitrary leadership from the Vatican. The plot is almost superficial to the highly stylistic visual aura that is employed here.  Patricia Arquette's nude scene in the bathtub is a captivatingly alluring piece of erotica beautifully photographed and edited. Her naked beauty and the wounds that her body undergoes mesmerize Bern as he begins to investigate Arquette's s manifestations of the STIGMATA. The lashing and scourging montage of Arquest's exquisitely arched naked back as her quivering flesh wrenches lash after lash to an almost climatic utterance of screams is unusually enthralling and alluring. This film has a curious sadomasochistic undertone running throughout that is unfortunately forsaken as the film's enters into a predictable and conventional conclusion.

$review_text.: This three disc set is worth every penny. I had seen this before and had to have it. It goes into detail about Shawn Michaels in-ring career and also discusses some of the personal issues he faced throughout his life. Some of it is truly heartbreaking to say the least. But it ends well. The very reason I respect the man is because of the major life changes he has made (as said in this DVD). Anyhow I highly recommend this DVD to anybody willing to watch it.

$review_text.: Alex is a college graduate whose parents got him a job at a law firm, but what he really wants to do is play poker. He meets Tommy Vinson, a former poker pro who promised his wife 20 years ago that he'd never play again, and has kept his promise. Tommy becomes Alex's mentor and stakes him in tournaments."Deal" has  some not-so-subtle product placement (PokerStars and World Poker Tour) and the story is like a poker remake of "The Color of Money", but the actors are good and it's entertaining if you like poker and don't mind that it's a bit predictable. Several poker pros appear as themselves, including Antonio Esfandiari, Greg Raymer, Joe Hachem and Phil Laak, whose girlfriend Jennifer Tilly also appears, not as herself but as a poker pro. 3 stars.

$review_text.: Superman is THE most overdone character in comics history. Movies, toons, TV shows, books, etc it is no wonder we are not sick of him by now... Which is why I give this show praise. It re-invented the character and made him more interesting than he has ever appeared before (until Smallville came along). From this first volume I enjoyed the episodes featuring LiveWire, Parasite, Metallo, Brainiac and the brief introduction to Darkseid. These episodes were all extremely well done and in the same mold as the much superior Batman: The Animated Series. However there are a few clunkers, too. The Prometheon is torture to sit through, as our the ones with the released Phantom Zone inmates and (I know I'm in the minority here) the Lobo episode.I do have to give much kudos though for the Toyman! What an excellent and frightful interpretation of that character! Bravo! That face/mask alone would give any kid nightmares!Again, I rate this beneath Batman because the writing and characters seem subpar. In the Batman universe you connect with his villians because each one has an emotional scar (much like Bats himself) that propels them to be who they are. Mr. Freeze and the love for his sick wife, Harley and her obsession with the Joker, Mad Hatter and his quest for love and Ivy and her inability to have children...all of these characters are so muli-dimensional that they make the Superman villians pale in comparison. Lex Luthor is a rich guy who wants power, Brainiac wants to collect information, LiveWire got shocked, Parasite got doused with toxic chemicals, etc. There is no human connection. The only one who remotely achieves this is Metallo.In all, I cannot wait for volume two!

$review_text.: This series is all about how we relate to technology and how it changes our world. James Burke takes us on a trip of a series of seemingly unrelated events, to where it results in something that changes everything, thereby affecting all our lives. We have become so dependent on our technology, so what happens when it fails? We recorded Connections 1 back in 1978 on VHS so we have watch this program over the years before buying it on DVD. In the opening scene of &#34;The Trigger Effect&#34; one will see the World Trade Center at the ground level and on its roof top. As this story unfolds there is a plane on final approach to the JFK airport. Then there is a massive technology failure causing this plane to head right for the downtown Manhattan skyscrapers. Its flight number is 911. Remember this is 1978 not 2001. Everyone who has ever visited our home and saw this opening scene ends up watching the entire 10 episodes. This box set is so worth it.

$REVIEW.: Hoffman definitely earned his Oscar with this production.  However, I find it interesting that no one claimed that he was simply impersonating Capote like many charged Jamie Foxx the year before.  I frankly think both actors did astonding jobs and truely convinced the audience that they were watching the real people they were portraying.  Hoffman's Capote was indeed a complicated man and it seemed in truth that he sold his soul for the 'novel he was born to write.'  There were parts when his wormy insincere persona just completely turned my stomach.  But be forwarned, this isn't a action movie.  No suspense.  It's truely a character study of a talented and intriguing man.  Overall: Highly recommanded.

$review_text.: Okay, the other reviewers rated the movie based on guessing
I actually got to view the movie.The plot goes something like this: Nazis release Hellboy who joins the good guys


60 years later Hellboy must fight creatures created by Rasputin (the bad guy who was a part of the Nazis)

That's really about it


There are other things within the movie too, but this is just the main idea.I liked Hellboy, but to me it didn't comare to the likes of other recent comic movies like X-Men and Spiderman
It was okay


At least it was better than the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen


I liked the Hellboy character and pretty much most of the other characters


The special effects are awesome and the action scenes are pretty cool too

Some of the movie is confusing though and that one bad guy with the blades just irritated me (and his part didn't make any sense)
I also wish that the fire girl and the fish man had more of a part in the movie


But, it is all okay
It is a comic movie anyway and shouldn't be taken too seriously anyway

It is a fun movie, but just a bit too lengthy.

$SUMMARY.: Saw Hellboy!

$review_text.: I remember being terrified by this movie as a child ...I remembered the first 20 minutes vividly, and it is still just as scary as it was when I was a kid.  Carol Kane is quite good as the terrified babysitter.  The phrase: "Why haven't you checked the children?" will now make you uneasy.  It is quick paced and suspenseful.  (I am sure I never saw past this point.)Then we jump forward in time to when the harasser escapes the insane asylum and begins his reign of terror again. After a prolonged police drama sequence (really unnecessary) we return to the babysitter, Carol Kane, now all grown up and with a family of her own.  Her and her husband go out for the night, and disturbing things begin to happen to her babysitter!!Overall, still a good film, even though the middle of the film (the bulk of it) lost my interest at times I still enjoyed it.  Tony Beckley has some truly great scenes as the demented stalker and Carol Kane is the quintessential hysterical woman.  Watch and enjoy!

$review_text.: For The Wrestler, I was hoping to write a companion review to my review of Black Swan, since these two movies are related, but I am at something of a loss.  This is a good thing.  Black Swan made an interesting review because it didn't quite work as a straight-forward story, requiring some explanation of director Aronofsky's method and purpose.  The Wrestler requires no explanation because it works better as a story.The view of The Wrestler and Black Swan as inversions--age vs. youth, career end vs. failed start, male vs. female, performance arts, physical discipline, broken homes, sexual isolation, suicide--still holds, but whereas Black Swan is often forced, bordering on contrivance, The Wrestler contains similar themes and techniques effortlessly.  The best example of this is Aronofsky's free association technique, which is on display in The Wrestler by referencing Passion Plays when Mickey Rourke wrestles "the stapler" (a Jesus lookalike) on a bed of barbed wire (aka thorns).  The reference fits seamlessly into the storyline.Whereas Black Swan left me fairly indifferent to the fate of the characters, The Wrestler was quite affecting and deserves the praise it received.  Aronofsky has done an admirable thing in telling the story of a failed man in our society--"sacrificial Rams" to which we are supposed to be blind, and that we normally see onscreen only in the context of bums or mental health patients.

$review_text.: Dan Stevens is luminous in this lengthy three part and very faithful adaption of the book that won a Man Booker prize, playing Nick Guest, the gay middle class Oxford grad who goes in search of love and beauty along the Tory set in Thatcher's London.  Kudos must be given to Tim McInnerny who could not be better in the role of the pompous and somewhat false Tory MP Gerald Fedden.  And Alice Krige also gives a touching portrayal of Rachel Fedden.  Friend of son Toby, Nick comes to stay as a vacation house minder in the Fedden's magnificent Kensington Park Gardens mansion. In addition to minding the house, Nick is also to keep an eye on volatile daughter Catherine (the Cat) a cutter who walks a manic-depressive line.Having done well over the vacation, Nick is invited to lodge there while pursuing his doctoral degree at UCL, to serve as a buffer between Cat and her parents, and as a filial substitute and general dogsbody and syncophant to the egotistical Fedden.  In this, he's a little false. While he's in love with their lifestyle, he's also critical of it, seeming to secretly sympathise and long to be Tory when with Gerald and his friends, and with Labor when with more middle class associates. He's a lodger, who pays a little rent and lives in a tiny attic room, but is included in the parties and lifestyle of the rich Feddens.In the film, Stevens does a far better job of making the viewer like his character than the book does, giving him a naive, gushing, longing portrayal, making the most of his blue eyes and tousled locks.  It's just as well he does and that the film can't replicate the internal dialogue in the book, where Guest will give a spoken compliment and mentally take it back. It makes the viewer sympathize and like his character far better than it deserves. making him a little less of a leech, and makes the ending a bit more shocking.While living with the family,ostensibly pursuing his degree, Guest's primary mission is to find love, or failing that, sex.  He goes about this in a clueless and not terribly competent way. With all Guest's physical charms and Oxford accomplishments, he can't seem to develop an honest relationship.  The same issues that drive him to lodge with the Tory Feddens cause him to latch onto millionaire Wani Ouradi, a beautiful closeted and gay fellow Oxford grad, who takes Nick on as am employee and sometime lover. But Wani is more interested in coke, porn and sex than his business, and regards Nick more as just another bought and paid for syncophant than lover, employee or equal. And the specter of Aids begins to haunt the gay community.Catherine flies from depression to mania, and when manic, babbles secrets that were best kept hidden. Nick the outsider is an easy scapegoat for the troubles she creates,partly because he was her "minder" partly because he's suspected of telling one of Gerald's secrets that she discerned on her own. And Nick's tentative house of cards, that depended not upon real regard, but upon at least partly false relationships between all these people, begins to fall.One difference between the book and the film -- the film also makes Nick's ultimate fate more optimistic, if still open-ended. It also offers a final scene with Catherine that wasn't in the book, but should have been.This film has wonderful performances, beautiful settings and an allegedly faithful representation of Tory London and the fallout of AIDS on the gay community in the 80s. The problem (and it is the same in the book, if less so), is that Nick Guest isn't, and was never meant to be an entirely likable character, and his fate is left very open ended.  But while the characters aren't entirely likable, they are well drawn enough to be unforgettable, and it is a mini-series worth seeing.

This Movie is one of them!I remember seeing this movie at the video store and wonder: "what the hell is this about?" I put the dvd in the player, pressed start and the rest was magic! I loved it so much I watched it twice that day, and ordered it the next day.If you are a big fan of film editing, this movie will amaze you! I have not been so excited from a movie by how it was cut! You have to see it for yourself, to see what I am talking about.The story, plot, characters, sound, lighting, edit, and music are purely great!

$REVIEW.: in the fantastic "Deduce You say"; a WB takeoff on Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, in this version you have Daffy as the famous Sherlock Holmes and Porky Pig as Watson. The dialogue and atmospheric setting in this one are amazing and VERY funny; when they go to the local pub looking for the Shropshire Slasher, Daffy leans back on the bar and orders "hot buttered gin" with a dozen darts stuck in his beak, the price of annoying one of the female bar patrons. When the object of their search finally makes an appearance, Porky interviews him and elicits the information thusly: "Name, my good man?" "Shropshire Slasher." "Occupation?" "Shropshire Slasher." Doesn't get any better than this; these cartoons are absolutely hilarious, and this collection has some real gems,my personal favorite being "Feed the Kitty" a Chuck Jones masterpiece, involving an English Bulldog and his tiny kitty friend. When Marc Antony (Bulldog) first encounters kitty, he barks furiously, instead of running away the kitty purrs and rubs up against him. It is mutual love at first sight, and although Marc Antony endeavors to hide his little friend, eventually he is caught red-handed. There is a scene of the lady of the house baking cookies, and the kitty has been hiding in the batter bowl; when Marc Antony looks through the window, all he sees is the mixing bowl operating a a furious pace, and thinking his kitty has been chopped to bits, emits a tortured howl and collapses in grief on the sidewalk...when the lady comes out and lets him back in she gives him a cookie...unfortunately the cookie is in the shape of a kitten! Thinking it is his friend, he puts it on his back, where the real kitty used to ride, and then his chin quivers and he breaks down in really inconsolable sobbing. Then the kitty, unhurt, walks up to him and purrs and rubs his chin; Marc Antony is overjoyed! In the end, he is allowed to keep his kitty. This is a pure joy to watch."Dripalong Daffy" is a riot; Porky Pig as sidekick and comic relief to Daffy Duck, who becomes sheriff of Gower Gulch, (an inside joke/reference to the nickname for the WB Studio, located in what was then known as Gower Gulch...) and they enter the local saloon looking for a villian, who, when he enters the salon, demands his "usual." This is a frightening concoction that necessitates the bartender donning Asbestos gloves, face shield and a special apron; then tongs! The mixture is so volatile it emits tiny explosions, adn then, when ice is added, the cubes jump out of the glass and run away screaming...The bad guy downs this appalling drink and his only reaction is his hat does a backflip. Daffy demands his own; the results are somewhat different; he turns all shades of the rainbow, including PLAID and POLKA DOTS, then walks arounfd like a mechanical doll and then recites Mary Had a Little Lamb in a child's high pitched voice...the showdown is wonderful; all kinds of amazing camera angles, and shots from high hotel windows, and the ominous clanking of spurs...this is strongly reminiscent of "High Noon" and is simply terrific."Wearing of the Grin" is one of the most surreal cartoons ever to emerge from the amazing minds of the WB animators; this is Salvador Dali come to life...Porky Pig, travling through Ireland, becomes lost and tired in a thunderstorm and seeks refuge at a local haunted castle, and the caretakers, O'Pat and O'Mike, clay pips firmly upside down in their mouths, come and assist Porky and get him a "nice soft bed" for the night...but first the O'Pat and O'Mike characters split up and we see they are actually 2 Leprechauns...and one of them asks Porky "Have you seen my other half, sir?" There they are, 2 separate Leprechauns, and one of them says to Porky "Isn't this sight enough to make the heart stand crossways in ye?" Porky goes into shock and they put after his head hits the pillow, Porky falls asleep and has a Dali nightmare...the end of which he is sentenced to the wearing of the green shoes. These shoes are tap shoes and force him to dance and dance uncontrollably; finally he wakes up and escapes from the castle."Water Water Every Hare" is another great one; Bugs falls asleep and is carried out of his rabbit hole by a rain storm and is deposited at the nightmare Castle of the Evil Scientist, (a miniscule version of Boris Karloff) whose castle conveniently has a neon sign stating "Evil Scientist" flashing off and on...once inside, Bugs is going to be used for his brain to go into the cranium of the enormous metal robot the scientist hasbuilt....Naturally,m Bugs has some objections to this and thre scientist enlists the aid of the Monster..this is a great character, covered with hair and complete with sneakers! Bugs finally corrals the Monster and shrinks him down to about three inches; he packs his bags and leaves in disgust...when the scientist returns, Bugs breaks a bottle of chloroform and chases Bugs in a hilarious slomo chase. saying "come.....back......here..........you........rab....bit."Great stuff, a must have, and wait 'til you see what's coming next! Check it out:Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour, The - Golden Collection Volume 2 - Complete List of Cartoons!Last March we reported on a heads-up from Warner Bros. that The Looney Toons - Golden Collection Volume 2 would be out later in 2004.

$REVIEW.: I did enjoy this film Series ALOT.  I mean, what can you say about the REAL Devil's Child right?  While the Blu-Ray did enhance & clear the picture quite a bit, it did detract a bit from my viewing pleasure.  Overall this set is excellent & does include the poorer 2006 re-make with Liv Shrieber & Julia Stiles.  But Unfortunately doesn't include the &#34;Omen IV: The Awakening&#34; that was made for TV in the early 1990's like it was in the DVD Collection of the Omen.  Although that wasn't very good, I would have liked to have had it included.And if anyone is interested, music/soundtrack is REALLY scary.  I have the Original 3 Omen movies soundtracks on CD & I tell you BROTHER!!!  It REALLY scares the HELL out of my friends when they hear it!

$review_text.: "Transsiberian" exploits the unsettling idea of strangers in a strange land, adrift of everything familiar, when things start to go very wrong. Jessie (Emily Mortimer) and Roy (Woody Harrelson) are an American couple taking the scenic route home from their charity work in China: a week-long train journey from Beijing to Moscow on the Trans-Siberian railway. A short-tempered Russian stewardess and a mysterious French passenger telling tales of police brutality seem like an ominous start, but Jessie and Roy are soon enjoying the trip, often in the company of a rakish Spaniard named Carlos (Eduardo Noriega) and his young American girlfriend Abby (Kate Mara), who share their compartment. When Roy is left behind in Irkutsk, the rest of the foursome get off at the next station to wait for him to catch up. Carlos' sinister charm and illicit livelihood make a dangerous cocktail when mixed with these unusual circumstances. Just how dangerous, Jessie does not discover until she meets Roy's new roommate, Russian narcotics detective Ilya Grinko (Ben Kingsley).Brad Anderson, director and co-writer of "Transsiberian", starts off by showing us the strain in Jessie and Roy's marriage and the inevitable discomfort of coping with a foreign culture. Everyone, including the audience, is uneasy before bad things start to happen. Straight-laced Roy is always good-natured and friendly. Jessie is less optimistic and, we soon learn, trying hard to leave behind a checkered past. These personalities will have to react in a pressure cooker situation that is so unsettling because it is so plausible. The atmosphere is both exotic and gritty and the train slithers across the Siberian countryside. Spaces are always cramped. People are always working class and not happy about it, as if this is the converse of Agatha Christie's Orient Express passenger list. The anxiety that comes from being foreigners in a strange culture is the everpresent, driving force of the story, which is why "Transsiberian" gets under the audience's skin. The DVD (First Look 2008) has no bonus features. Subtitles are available in English SDH and Spanish.

$REVIEW.: Never a dull moment in this is a great action flick.  This may be the best of its genre in a long, long time.  Jerry Bruckheimer has outdone himself.  The movie opens with the two great scenes, including the well planned (and almost perfectly implemented) break in at an Army arsenal and the disarming of a terrorist bomb by Cage at work.  The action does not let up until the final climactic struggles.Great casting, with Sean Connery as a political prisoner (and former member of the British elite Special Air Service, the only man alive to break out of Alcatraz).  Add Nicholas Cage as  FBI agent (and self-described biochemical "super freak", who of course is grossly overmatched among these hard guys.  Their foil is Ed Harris, who is great  as a highly decorated military officer, disillusioned by the betrayal of his men during Desert Storm, and his cadre of soldiers.  The supporting roles include David Morse, John McGinley and Greg Collins as his loyal soldiers, and John Spencer as a less than honorable FBI director  They are all joined at Alcatraz prison, taken over by Harris and his men.  They hold a few hostages (irrelevant to the story), along with rockets filled with deadly poison gas. Unless the government pays the big bucks, they will unleash their deadly toxins. Only a sixty year old Connery can get them onto the Rock, with the support of a  group of Navy Seals and fighter planes to save the day.Of course, they do.Not a dull moment in this movie.

Like Babylon 5 and Angel, Firefly got little respect in its own era. But just you watch: It will grow like a cult, and perhaps better than that, will set a new standard for what mainstream should be. For whatever reason, Firefly was cancelled before it had a chance to grow.But grow it will. To coin a phrase, we will make it so...

$review_text.: After re-watching a dozen episodes from The Dick Van Dyke Show, I changed my mind and decided that I should, after all, write an Amazon review for the series


Not because I think many people will see my review, which will undoubtedly be hidden beneath multiple pages of previously-posted reviews

Not because I think Amazon readers need any more recommendations to get this set after reading the scores of such recommendations already present


Not even because it would be fun to reminisce as I wrote the review about everything I liked about the show over the years


No, I decided to write this review because, after rewatching these classic episodes again, I realized afresh that The Dick Van Dyke Show is one of the best, perhaps THE best, comedy series I've ever seen, and if even a single person watches this show for the first time because of this review, the effort would be entirely justified.There are lots of funny TV shows, but I can't think of any that have affected me like The Dick Van Dyke Show has


My childhood is filled with the memories of watching the show with my father as I grew up
We sat there together, laughing out loud, over and over again, day after day, and felt like we were special guests to be asked into Rob and Laura Petrie's family each week


But were these childhood memories just a figment of my passing childhood, laughs that would disappear with time and a new social context? Not one bit
As I watch these shows in sparkling, crystal-clear DVD format (the "DVD" being no relation to "Dick Van Dyke"!), I find myself laughing - and enjoying - these episodes as if I never saw them before


And even when I have the jokes and the sequences memorized - and for many of them, I do - I can find no other reaction other than to laugh out loud as I did when I was kid
This is a downright, flat-out funny, witty, enjoyable, and entertaining program.Can comedy be funny without resort to off-color language? Can shtick and physical humour actually be supremely hilarious? Can an element of sophistication be woven into comedy so that the audience can laugh at itself without being insulted? Can timeless themes be woven into stories that actually entertain? One needs watch only a handful of Dick Van Dyke Show episodes easily to quickly affirm each of these questions
And perhaps more impressively, its easily apparent that the cast and crew pull this off silky ease, belieing the true work that was put into the show

There's no question about it: the writing, the plot lines, the acting, and the personal charm of those involved in The Dick Van Show set a standard apart from others, a standard that sees no wear from the ravages of time


It doesn't matter that we are watching black-and-white in a clearly post-1950's suburban home and work setting: we see color and modernity even as we look right through these unimportant backdrops


The themes and talent that pours out of nearly every episode is unaffected by time, setting, and costume.I once heard Carl Reiner say that Dick Van Dyke was the most talented entertainer he had ever known
It's hard to disagree with him once we've seen the show

Van Dyke is like Rowan Atkinson, but in spades, and with an inner charm that endears the watcher
He can sing, he can dance, he can tell jokes with precision timing, he can use understatement as a weapon, and he can make us totally sympathetic to his plights without appearing whiny


Rob Petrie, but more importantly, Dick Van Dyke, strikes us as an intensely decent person imbued with a joy of life that pervades everything he does


Actually, we are CONVINCED he is an intensely decent person, and we are just there for the ride as we watch him move through life with all its comic ups and downs

He could have never done it without Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, and Mary Tyler Moore (not to mention all the others who worked on the show before the camera), but Van Dyke stands out as that supremely gifted individual, a talent amongst a group of talents, Holland's gift to America

That so many gifted individuals could work together without stepping on each other's toes is a miracle in itself


It's an assemblage of people rarely seen, and I fear, not to be seen again for a long time.Season One gets off to a rocky start


In retrospect, we can see the show is trying to figure out itself, trying to understand how all the pieces work together, trying to determine how stories are to be assembled for best impact
The show was slated for cancellation twice that year, and only after Sheldon Leonard stepped in to rescue it - and a change of time slot for Season Two right after the successful Beverly Hillbillies - did the show take off.But in Season Two, the show takes off like no rocket you've ever seen before
Season One has some strong episodes and great plot ideas, but it's Season Two that sees the cast working in a seamless, slick, and sophisticated manner that turns the show into a timeless classic


It's almost as if everyone involved realized they were given a second chance, and with that, the gloves came off, the worries were put aside, and everyone just got "into the groove." The show knocked out one outstanding episode after another, and by the time Season Five occurred, everyone knew that this might likely be the highlight of their careers


The show was ended at the height of it's popularity because of Reiner's insistence - he said he did not want to show to die slowly, but go out while at the top of form - and we can only wonder what a "Season Six" might have held for us

But it's no matter
These are comedic masterpieces at the top of form, a goal for others to try and match, and a standard by which all others are measured.If you've never seen The Dick Van Dyke Show and wonder what it is about, I'll tell you
It's about a somewhat charmed life of a regular group of people who are talented, happy, and good natured and who face the normal problems, irritation, and strange events that are a part of nearly everyone's life


That's all you need to know


Start with Season Two and work forward from there

When you are done, go back to Season One and see how they figured it all out in those early months
But by then, you'll already be won over by the many wonderful episodes, and will doubtless be re-watching these over and over again
Millions of people of have done so over the years
To watch these episodes is to easily understand why.A Note on the Technical Quality of the Blu-Ray Release (2013)Well, it finally happened: the already high-quality DVD release of the complete Dick van Dyke Show has now been released in high definition Blu-Ray format
And in spite of the quality of the DVD release (these truly are a very high quality DVD offering), the Blu-Ray release improves it even further

It appears as though the high definition scans of the original film has brought out incredible detail present in the film that has never before been possible to see
In fact, the Blu-Ray release shows for the first time the incredible film quality achieved at the time of filming, and with little exaggeration it can be said that few television shows, particularly those of this era, but in truth, any television show prior to the advent of high definition, will reveal this level of detail

Tweed suits show every stich


Every piece of hair seemingly stands out on its own
Books, photos, and nicknacks on the wall are readable (ever wondered who those names were on the board outside of Rob's office? Now you can easily tell ...)

The whole show seems almost to pop out in three dimensional reality

If you're a Dick van Dyke aficionado, this set is completely worth the re-purchase (give your DVD set to a young person to whom you would like to share Dick van Dyke)

If you've never purchased the DVD's, then get these instead


Amazing.

$review_text.: If you saw this movie when it was brand-new and you were a 10-year-old  boy, it'll always have a special place in your heart.This is actually  two movies. The first half is the pedestrian, uninspired one as  preparations are made inside an orbiting space station -- nicknamed the  &quot;Wheel&quot; because of its shape -- for man's first flight to Mars.  The situations and dialog here are laced with that oafish humor which  George Pal apparently felt was necessary to sugar-coat the movie's more  technical aspects.Once the ship is launched, however, things markedly  improve and the movie's second half contains scene after scene which still  linger in the memory even after more than 40 years: the encounter with an  asteroid, the burial in space, the landing on Mars, the snowfall during a  Martian Christmas, etc.Three members of the cast went on to greater  renown. Eric Fleming soon starred in TV's &quot;Rawhide&quot; series with  Clint Eastwood. William Redfield piloted a miniature submarine through the  human body in &quot;Fantastic Voyage.&quot; And Walter Brooke later said  one word in &quot;The Graduate&quot; to Dustin Hoffman --  &quot;Plastics.&quot;

$REVIEW.: In 1943 Errol Flynn was in trouble. His best days were behind him - Captain Blood (1935), Major Vickers (1936), Robin Hood (1938), the Earl of Essex (1939), George Armstrong Custer (1941), and Gentleman Jim Corbett (1942) were done and gone. He was being criticized for not being in the war (he became a naturalized US citizen in 1942), and he was defending himself against charges of statutory rape. He was near the apex and a steep decline was ahead of him. Apart from "Objective Burma" (1945), he would make one undistinguished film after another until 1957 when he made "The Sun Also Rises" and "Too Much Too Soon". In 1958 he made my favorite later day Flynn film - "The Roots of Heaven" - and he died shortly after that.But here in 1943 Flynn was trying to reinvent himself, as something less than a swashbuckler, since everyone was asking how he could be so strong and hearty and not be in the war (the answer was that he had serious heart and other problems, but the studio was reluctant to publicize this). He earnestly wanted to do patriotic films to compensate for his rejection by the Armed forces.He had some success with "Edge of Darkness" (1943) in which he played a Norwegian resistance fighter and then he appeared in a musical (!) "Thank Your Lucky Stars" as part of a Hollywood fund raiser. "Northern Pursuit" was his next project. Flynn plays a Canadian Mountie who joins a Nazi group active in Canada. As with "Edge of Darkness" Flynn emphasizes his anti-Nazi activities but keeps his contribution well within the limits of mortal man. No swashbuckling here.In his autobiography Flynn said - "How deep the yearning is of an actor who has been stereotyped, who has that sword and horse wound around him, to prove to himself and to others that he is an actor."Bear in mind that in 1943 the war was still going on and victory was by no means certain.The film features Helmut Dantine, Gene Lockhart, and Tom TullyHandsomely chiseled Helmut Dantine (1918-82) plays the bad guy. Dantine was an Austrian who spent time in a concentration camp and a fervent anti-Nazi in real life, but he often played a Nazi on screen, most memorably in "Mrs. Minerva" (1942) and co-starred with Flynn in "Edge of Darkness". In later life he hooked up with Sam Peckinpah and produced and appeared in several of his films including "Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" (1974) and "Killer Elite" (1975).Versatile Gene Lockhart (1891-1957) appeared in more than 100 films and was nominated as Best Supporting Actor in 1939 for "Algiers" (won by Walter Brennan for "Kentucky"). The father of actresses Kathleen and June Lockhart, he's best remembered for his roles as the judge in "Miracle on 34th Street" (1947) and Georges de la Tremouille in "Joan of Arc" (1948), but I remember him best as Bob Cratchit in "A Christmas Carol" (1938). This is one of the few films in which Lockhart plays a bad guy.This was the film debut of Tom Tully (1908-82) who plays a police Inspector. Tully made more than 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar for "The Caine Mutiny" (1954). He transitioned to TV in the 50s and appeared as a regular on "The Lineup" (1954-9), "The Dick van Dyke Show" (1964-6) and "Shane" (1966).The film is directed by Raoul Walsh (1887-1980). Walsh and Flynn did 7 films together, following Flynn's break-up with Michael Curtiz with whom he made his classic swashbuckler films. Walsh had been an actor appearing as John Wilkes Booth in Griffith's "Birth of a Nation" (1915). He turned to directing in 1930, directing John Wayne in his first film ("The Big Trail"). Walsh directed such notable films as "The Roaring Twenties" (1939), "Dark Command" (1940), "They Drive By Night" (1940), "High Sierra" (1941) and "White Heat" (1949). He started working with Flynn in 1941 ("They Died with their Boots On") and they continued working together through 1945 ("San Antonio"). Walsh declined notably in the 50s after he left Warner Brothers, but his 50+ year career made him one of Hollywood's most memorable directors.Walsh and Flynn were drinking buddies. Flynn called him a "great and imaginative" director.Sid Hickox handles the camera. Hickox made hundreds of films for Warner's and transitioned to TV in the 50s where he worked on "I Love Lucy" and "The Andy Griffith Show". Though never nominated for any award, his camerawork was good, and he was responsible for films such as "God is my Co-Pilot" (1945), "White Heat" (1949), and my Hickox favorite, "Dark Passage" (1947). Hickox worked with Flynn on several films including "Edge of Darkness" (1943), "Uncertain Glory" (1944) and "Gentleman Jim" (1942). Although Hickox's camera work is good, the use of cheap models detracts from the value of the film. This is particularly true in the climactic fight aboard an airplane.Adolph Deutsch (1897-1980) provides a good musical score, although at times it is a little intrusive, perhaps because the plot bogs down. Deutsch was nominated 5 times for an Oscar and won 3 times - "Annie Get Your Gun" (1950), "Seven Bridges for Seven Brothers" (1954), and "Oklahoma" (1955). Not only was he competent in musicals, Deutsch also scored several wartime films like "The Fighting 69th" (1940), "Across the Pacific" (1942), and "Uncertain Glory" (1944). The later he reprised with Flynn, Hickox, and Walsh.It's interesting to note that this film is similar to "49th Parallel" (1941), another film about Nazi activity in Canada, although "49th Parallel" is a far superior film.The NY Times' Bosley Crowther said "Apparently Warner Brothers was reduced to a desperate extreme in finding a new story for Errol Flynn..." and "the action is stilted and stagey, the tension indifferently drawn."1943 was an OK year in films - The top grossing films included "This is the Army", "For Whom the Bell Tolls", "Song of Bernadette", "Coney Island", and "Stage Door Canteen". Other notables included "The Ox Bow Incident". The big Oscar winner was "Going My Way", and other winners included "Gaslight" and "None But the Lonely Heart"War films were particularly popular - "Action in the North Atlantic" with Bogart and Raymond Massey, "Air Force" with John Garfield, "Bataan" with Robert Taylor and Lloyd Nolan, "Bombadier" with Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott, "Corvette K-255" with Randolph Scott, "Five Graves to Cairo" with Franchet Tone and Anne Baxter, "Hangmen Also Die" with Brian Donlevy and Walter Brennan, and "Hitler's Children."If you're an Errol Flynn fan you'll want to see this film, as his character roles in the mid 40s provide a whole other look at Flynn as an actor. This isn't the classic swashbuckler from the 30s, and if you're new to Flynn films you might want to watch these films first. Of this era, my personal preference is "Objective Burma" (1945) and this is certainly not one of his better films.

$review_text.: From the new MGM Vault releases, I decided to watch CLOWN HOUSE first. I was quite impressed with it.The plot: A young boy has been frightened by circus clowns since he was three years old. His older brother, 14, is understanding; another brother, 17, is a mean jerk who constantly ridicules the boy about his fears.The circus is in town, of course, and guess who doesn't want to go, but is bullied into it by his oldest brother. As fate would have it, three escaped mental patients kill three clowns, take their clothes and break into the home of the three boys when mom and dad are away.It takes half the picture for the youngest kid to convince his two older brothers that the clowns aren't just in his imagination. Even the police won't believe him.This is one of the best-choreographed horror films I've seen and reminds me of a darker version of HOME ALONE.  The amount of times the two older brothers just miss seeing the clowns is amazing and done with extraordinary skill by the filmmakers. I wonder why this film isn't better known? I've seen worse become big hits at the box office. I'm not saying it's a forgotten masterpiece, but I don't think many will be disappointed if they give it a look.

$REVIEW.: This is a wonderful retelling of the old tale.  The classic Dracula lore modernized with elements of the pop-culture &quot;slayer&quot; phenomena and added historical depth.  Great story: Someone has finally explained Dracula's fear of Christian icons.  The action sequences and special effects are a thrill to watch!  The film starts off in London and moves to New Orleans.  The London heist is very exciting.  As for New Orleans, does Mardi Gras happen every day there?  The characters are all good looking (even the clergy), but they actually have some depth.  Unfortunately, their screen time does not allow the audience to really care about most of them before it's too late.  Fans of Jonny Lee Miller and Omar Epps will not be disappointed!  Jeri Ryan fans will be left wanting more, but will enjoy her none-the-less!  Just keep in mind that this is more of an action film than a horror.  Some good humour that I won't spoil, but I will say that they make great use of &quot;company sponsorship&quot;.

$REVIEW.: I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie. For pure romance, feel... everything, it's one of my few favorite romantic movies and I don't watch a lot of them. It's beautiful to look at - the scenery is incredible, the characters are deep and well-developed. Horse people are the greatest people my brother used to say. You can see it in this movie, a tough, gentle, passionate feel. Jessica and her strong guardian, the tough feminist reformer that reminds me of old America (though it's Australian here), clashing with her strong-willed father over love. Jim is the young ranch hand who grew up in a rough mountain environment, grieving over his father's death, trying to earn his way, and is now working on her father's farm. He's also willful and tough and has big dreams. Their personalities are alike and they seem bound to clash or love each other. The people here are tough like the land and it all comes together in a grand, sweeping romance. The music is incredibly beautiful - I was inspired to learn the Snowy River theme on the piano and used to love to play bits of it. I still get a great feel from the scene where they train the stallion together as pictured on the cover. Strong, good people who love and endure. Everything about this movie reminds me of home and all I loved about it. If you grew up on a farm or ranch, around animals and prairies, this will ease your homesickness, or celebrate your love if you still live there. The sequel is good also - rare for a sequel to movies like this, both worth watching. I hate Hollywood, but I sure have trouble giving up some of my old - or any - movies, they're so much a part of my life. I think I'll keep them, but work on dismantling their exploitation of people's lives and stories.

$review_text.: 'Carnal Knowledge' released in '71 tells the story of two friends obsessed with themselves and their personal sexual fantasies and desires.Jonathan (Jack Nickelson) has no problem getting the ladies into bed, his problem is communicating verbally with them after the great event. Ao the other hand Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is an accomplished communicator but is unable to make the transition from friend to sex partner with his girlfriend Susan (Candice Bergen).This is narcissism and '70's nihilism at its zenith. The film does deliver strong performances , but the subject matter and the spiraling negativism is a little hard to endure. One of the main draws of this movie is Ann-Margret who looks fantastic, it's worth a viewing just for her.

It could have made A-List levels if the CG effects were higher quality; however the special effects were passable. The storyline is great and all actors performed to A-list levels.  The sets, wardrobe and props were very good. Overall the movie is well done, and there are no dry or dull areas in this movie. This is a rare classic, it&#8217;s not just another shark movie, don&#8217;t rent it, I recommend purchase on Blue ray. Remember, this movie takes place in Australia so everyone has accents. In closing, &#8230; because it&#8217;s very rare to come across a well-polished, well-made upper end (B)  movie that almost made A-list&#8230;I give it a solid (5) star rating! Thanks

It is a movie about George, who try's to live his life with out lies. Eddie's probation officer tells him he need's to spend time with George for community service. A few people think George is a man named Gabe. They try to give him a lot of money and a big house to live in. Along with a wife, who Gabe left five months ago. Eddie convinces George to play along and the lie's get bigger and funnier. In the end it was all a trick so Gabe's partner can make people think Gabe was back and kill him so he can get all of the money and own the business. But this being a funny movie you know George gets away with dying.

$review_text.: For me "The Mist" short story was one of the scariest of King's (And I've read 90%+ of his stuff). I love King's books but the same horror his books instill just does not always translate to the movie screen. For me, "The Mist" the movie is a strange entity, I'm not sure I liked it, in fact I'm pretty sure I did NOT like it. However, I didn't like it because it was horrifying (and thats a good sign of a good horror movie right?).This movie had my heart racing, had me shouting at the TV, "Don't Open the DOOR!!!", and pacing the floor after the ending. So in the end, the fact that I had a strong reaction to the film compels me to give it a fairly high rating. I can't really say why I reacted so, although i think its because I'm a dad now and there was a little boy in jeopardy most of the film. So, if you are in the mood for a really horrifying (different from scary or gross or freaky) movie The Mist is worth checking out.One last thing, the ending is not the same as the book and is terribly depressing, you'll see....

$review_text.: Even for those plucky naysayers who are skeptical of the impact young Gustavo Dudamel is making not only in his new home with the Los Angeles Philharmonic but in the tenor of classical music around the world, this DVD of the maestro conducting his Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra in performances of the Mussorgsky/Ravel 'Pictures at an Exhibition' and a radiant performance of Beethoven's Triple Concerto with Martha Argerich and Renard and Gautier Capucon as soloists will erase all doubts of the exciting musicality that emanates from this gifted wunderkind. The sound reproduction of the DVD is excellent and the manner in which the cinematographers have captured both the wholly involved conductor and performers immersed in this music is excellent.But there are two aspects of this recorded  live performance that are especially noteworthy.  One, the concert in from the usually somewhat staid Salzburg Music Fetival in 2008, and witnessing the furor of reaction to Dudamel borders on adulation.  It is thrilling to see audiences respond so vocally and viscerally to a performance.  And two, the portion of the DVD that is called 'School of Listening' - moments of verbal intruction and interplay with his orchestra as they prepare for a performance of Mahler's First Symphony.  Even as a speaker Dudamel reaches out to his compatriots with selfless enthusiasm and some very fine ideas about Mahler that should result in lessons for us all.If Dudamel can recreate the magic of inspiring the youth of this country to reach for dreams the way he has influenced the youth of Venezuela, then the future of Classical music is secure.  This is a delightful and enriching DVD.  Grady Harp, October 09

$review_text.: H20 is mainly a follow-up on the Laurie Strode character and while the that story was handled well the film suffers from the lack of Dr

Loomis.H20 was actually my introduction to the Halloween series and probably the reason it took me a while to follow up by seeing the original films
The reason being that the film is a fairly generic mid-90's slasher aside from the brother vs
sister angle

The final fight and aftermath is great, but the other kills (especially the opener) are fairly boring.The Michael Myers character and performance are great, the only problem being that they allowed us to see his eyes and they were far from "the blackest eyes...the devil's eyes".Personally, I would have preferred a follow up to Halloween 4 that brought Jamie in contact with Laurie (friendly or otherwise) then Michael appearing to attack them both.But overall, one of the better sequels in the series.

She meets and quickly falls in love with Alex and his family. But it turns out that its not as that easy for her to run away from her problems. They follow her to New York and soon her secrets not only threaten to rip apart her blossoming romance, but possibly end the lives of the family she has come to love. Alex has to find a way to save her without getting his family caught in the cross fire.I think the movie was a great spin off of Nicholas Spark's novel. It stays pretty true to the book which is something that always me happy. The cast was awesome. Josh Duhamel, who I have adored since his days on All My Children, gave a particularly heart-warming performance as a windowed dad. This is a great movie choice for date night since it has the romance the girls love and some actions for the guys.

$REVIEW.: Terry Gilliam is a genious.  He has yet to make a bad film.  His works include 12 Monkeys, The Fisher King, and Time Bandits.  Those films are all wonderful, But Brazil still stands as his masterpeice and the Criterion Collection of Brazil is the way to view it.The film starts off with a TV screen in the window of a store.  It is showing a commercial for a new duct design.  The Camera pulls back a bit and a happy shopper walks infront of the TV while pushing a cart.  The TV then blows up and the titles show.  Right off the bat we get what Brazil is all about; how bad it has really gotten.The clean up job that Criterian did with Brazils print is breath taking.  For many years I've had to put up with an old (132 minute) VHS version of Brazil, that was batterd and was watched more than 30 times.  And also the sound quality is up another notch from the original print.Gilliam directors cut is the best version of Brazil that you can find.  Alot of people have been complaining that the 142 minute cut does not add up to the greatness of the 132.  I beg the differ and think it is great. The added scenes are some of my favorite parts.My mouth wartered when I read the features on the 2nd disk, and they wartered even more when I saw them.  The hour-long battle of Brazil documentry is by far my favorite feature on this disk.  It really goes deap into it. The 30-minute documentry is very good as well.  It's funny how the cast dosen't even really know what the films about.The third disk shows how much a studio can change a film with a a snip here and a snip there, a close up here and a close up there.  This is great to watch with a commentery.  It is by a film historian who makes funny comments about the differences.I'd say, only get this if your a big fan of the film.  If you don't like it, or haven't seen it, rent it first and then see.  But I love it, and it is the best Criterian Disk since Rushmore.

$review_text.: Yes this set will have what a lot of fans call the filler episodes of Naruto that the animators for the series had to make until the manga series made more chapters so the animators didn't pass the manga chapter issues.  I feel that these were actually pretty good as you get to see Naruto and his friends interact more with each other than they do in the manga series.  You'll see Naruto teaming up with people like Hinata and Kiba to do a bounty hunt for a supposed criminal,  team up with Team Gai as they help a terrorized village from a notorious group of rogue ninja, and there are episodes of when Naruto teams up with just one partner for jobs like when he teams up with Ino who's hired to be a body double for a feudal lords  daughter. Some of the episodes are funny and comedic while others are dramatic and action packed but for the episodes still entertaining.  The animation is still pretty good and clear and the audio is great as well nice and sharp.  And as always the voice actors for both the dubbed and subbed versions did a superb job.  So until the Naruto Shippuden episodes arrive on dvd for us enjoy these episodes as they are very entertaining and fun to watch for any Naruto fan out there...

Redford is just ok as the commitment-phobic safari-mad Brit whom Karen Blixen falls for. He hasn't changed much since then, at least on screen. This was big, old-fashioned movie-making by the late Sydney Pollack, and it's still well worth watching. It's a bit less than PC by today's standards in its treatment of the "natives," however.

$REVIEW.: I watched the first episode right after I bought "Huff".  I found it very dark and kind of depressing.  Of course, I LOVED Blythe Danner as Huff's mother--she's the main reason I wanted to see the show--and she definitely deserved her two Emmy Awards for her wonderful performance as a woman who hides her pain with a sharp tongue.  It's worth watching "Huff" just for Ms. Danner.  Then a few months ago I decided to sit down and watch the second episode, which I enjoyed a lot more than the first.  Then I watched a third and a fourth episode--and I fell in love with the series and all of the memorable characters: Hank Azaria as Huff has never been better, Paget Brewster as Huff's wife Beth is letter perfect, Anton Yelchin is terrific as Huff's teenage son (his relationship with the girl he tutors is a riot), Andy Comeau is quietly effective in his brief appearances in each episode as Huff's troubled brother, and Oliver Platt is outrageous and quite touching as Huff's best friend, Russel.  Even the smaller roles are expertly cast with excellent actors, including Kimberly Brooks as Huff's no-nonsense office manager, Liza Lapira as Russel's no-nonsense secretary and Faith Prince as Kelly Knippers, whom Russel becomes involved with--all three of these women are outstanding! The only character I didn't care for was the Homeless Hungarian--I just didn't think he was necessary--and, fortunately, he's not around much in the later episodes.  With the first season ending on a doozy of a cliffhanger, I eagerly await the second season to arrive on DVD.  I have a frustrated feeling that I'll be waiting a long time for this, since I don't think Sony is in any rush to release "Huff's" second season on DVD.  "Huff" is a show that will grow on you--it sneaks up on you and forces you to love it.  Oh, and I almost forgot about one of my favorite actresses--Swoosie Kurtz, who plays Beth's ill mother--another great performance.  "Huff" is overflowing with greatness in all departments.  Is that high enough praise for you?  Rent it, buy it, steal it--do whatever it takes to watch one of the best shows I've seen in a long time.
$SUMMARY.: A terrific show full of laughs and tears . . .

$REVIEW.: Though some here and in other circles have remarked that they believe &quot;City Lights&quot; is overrated and over-sentimental, I still believe that one cannot deny how moving and beautiful the film becomes as it draws toward its conclusion. &quot;City Lights&quot; remains my favorite Chaplin movie with &quot;Modern Times&quot; coming in at a close second. Chaplin plays his classic Tramp character who falls for a blind flower girl and wants to help her earn money for an operation to cure blindness. The boxing scene in which the scrawny Chaplin takes on a seasoned prize fighter is the major comic highlight of the film featuring gags that have been imitated and recycled by countless other comedies. The finale is nothing short of touching, beautiful, and brilliant and shows perfectly the full emotion that can be conveyed in a silent picture. This is one of the few films that still, time and time again, can bring tears to my eyes. &quot;City Lights&quot; is a masterpiece.

$review_text.: I grew up watching these films, they kind of things that played on saturday afternoons.  They offered the amazing otherworldly feeling that movies can bring, this time in darkest Africa.  The films are old, made during the colonial era when the crudest stereotypes reigned, and the entire theme - that a white man is somehow king of the jungle - today is somewhat offensive.  Still, each film has an undeniable magic to them:  the stories are excellent and full of suspense, with the handsome Tarzan and beautiful Jane (yes, that is Mia Farrow's mother!), seemingly ageless and always winning.I watched these with my kids, who found them pretty laughable, but we enjoyed them immensely.  I am delighted to have them on my shelf for an occasional reminder of childhood fun.  You get Tarzan's mysterious discovery and meeting of Jane, the temptation of Jane to return to England with the machinations of a greedy conniver, and then the finding of boy.  All great stories.Warmly recommended.

$REVIEW.: This season starts off a few months after the shocking events from the season 1 finale, Veronica's life & the lives of those in her universe have changed some for better & some, worse

 Veronica is determined to get back her normal life but nothing is normal about life in Neptune


 The same great core cast & excellent writing remain the cornerstone of the show but it did take a darker turn and the "mysteries" became more convoluted.This season also introduced seemingly minor characters - the Casablancas family, Wallace's father & new girlfriend and Mac - Veronica's classmate & computer "go to gal"
 The only development that saddened me was the abrupt end to the romance between Veronica's dad & Wallace's mom - surely a show with such creative writers could have featured a classy break-up segment to give viewers some closure.This season's arcs were Veronica solving the mystery of the bus accident that killed the driver and several classmates and who killed Weevil's cousin
 Although not as compelling as the first season, this one still packs a punch in unraveling the two main mysteries as well as tying up loose ends from the previous season (one shockingly so since viewers believed that this storyline had been resolved already).It was great to be able to watch the show uninterrupted in one sitting because it made it easier to follow the storylines since when the show initially aired, I'd lost interest after the CW changed the air day & time so getting a chance to see the story resolution first hand was great.

$review_text.: Hmmm.  Let's take a journey in the way-back machine to those long-ago days of the late '90's, and remember when that wonderful new amazing invention, the Digital Versatile Disc, first appeared on the market...Remember how excited everyone was to have their films finally available in an affordable digital format that (with proper care) would never degrade and would probably last them for all of their lives?  But the excitement quickly gave way to indignation and disappointment when it was found that the powers-that-be releasing these glorious ground-breaking inventions still clung to outmoded ways of the past when it came to the format they chose to release their films in.  Many, too many, films were released full-frame to "fit" the then standard for home viewing available to the majority of people, that is, the 1:33 ratio, cathode ray tube television.  No matter that this cropping eliminated major portions of the image, in many cases effecting the stories because characters and/or scenery was glaringly excised out of the viewable image.So flash forward to the distant future of today, 2011...  Such problems are a thing of the silly past now due to the widespread availability of high-def, widescreen, televisions, right?  WRONG!  Seems there are just as many fools around today seeking to "improve" our home-viewing experience who feel they have the wisdom to mess with the original ratio of created works in order to "improve" them for the home-viewers, such as these moron at Warner Brothers who actually thought they were doing someone a favor by altering what were originally full-frame cartoons drawn and designed to be seen that way into cropped versions now desecrated in order to fill the image of all the widescreen televisions that are commonplace now.Oh man, it is to laugh (a certain silly aquatic fowl might say), that is if I wasn't so ticked-off about this.  Who are these jagoffs who are now running the Home Video Dept. at Warner Brothers?  If it's not this, it's those over-priced Warner Archive releases they have the nerve to charge top dollar of $20 for and not even properly remaster or go to the trouble of including some extras (hell, or even subtitles or chapter stops).

$REVIEW.: I chanced on this movie completely by accident. It was in the wrong box.  It opened with some goats and French subtitles.  I thought, oh boy, this will put me to sleep. Yet the movie works on many levels: on one, it is like a complex detective story, with tiny clues sprinkled throughout gradually coming together at an overwhelming ending. On one level, it is a comedy, poking fun at pompous scientists and ignorant folk. On another, it explores unrequited love, a topic the movies usually avoid. On another it about the lush scenery and quaint village life in France. Yves Montand is a brilliant actor. He packs so much depth into every second he is on screen.  He feels like a real person. It is a movie about faces, memorable, complex, elderly, even ugly faces.This movie is the very opposite of fluff.

$REVIEW.: THE INVISIBLE MAN can be an enjoyable movie - particularly if you don't take it too seriously. By the standards of the early 1930's the special effects are good enough and the acting by Claude Rains as the invisible man is superb.The story by H.G. Wells about a scientist who develops a method of becoming invisible and then gradually goes insane is unique. Local police who try to capture the invisible man provide much slapstick humor.Gloria Stuart who played the girl friend of the invisible man also acted in REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM and THE THREE MUSKETEERS in the 1930's as well as TITANIC and THE LOVE LETTER in the 1990's. Director James Whale directed FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN in the 1930's.

Some of the show flashed from crystal clear to fuzzy then back again. This is not the way to treat loyal fans.

$review_text.: Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper reunite in this 2000 made-for-television movie, where they reprise their old characters from the beloved long-running 1970s series "The Mary Tyler Moore Show."For reasons never really clear -- other than "life" got in the way -- the women haven't been in touch for nearly twenty years. Now, both Mary and Rhoda are (conveniently) single again, both in New York, and both the mothers of college-aged daughters. They're both having trouble in their respective careers, and with life in general, as women hovering at the next phase of their lives, and need one another's support more than ever.Diehard fans of MTM will have to ignore the flimsy plot and simply concentrate on the actors and characters they loved -- after all, having them together for any reason whatsoever is better than not having them together at all, isn't it? Understandably, some may choose to nix this reunion altogether, deciding instead to keep their beloved duo in the past where they seemed to belong most comfortably. But for those of you who are brave enough to give this film a try, you'll probably find it enjoyable -- nothing worth re-watching, or keeping in the DVD collection for years to come, but certainly a fun couple of hours spent relaxing and reminiscing with Moore and Harper, so familiar, it's almost like reuniting with old friends ourselves.

$review_text.: I'm not a student of English history so I was blissfully ignorant of some of the inaccuracies that other reviewers have mentioned.  So, for me, this was pure enjoyment.  The cast is excellent and the visuals are yummy.We follow the progression of the couple from their first indifferent meeting, to Victoria's statement that she never will marry, to their second meeting when she was thunderstruck by him.  I found his relationship to her very interesting.  He married out of duty and worried that she loved him more than he loved her.  Was this accurate I wonder?  The scene when he acknowledged to her, and to himself, the depth of his love for her, is very moving.  Her response was that it just took him a little longer to fall in love than it took her....very sweet!If you're not too picky about historical accuracy you will probably fall in love with Victoria and Albert.

$review_text.: ** Spoiler Free **You're either going to love or hate this movie.  I absolutely hated Blair Witch and never thought I would get into these types of movies.  For instance, I watched Quarantine and besides a couple "boo" moments I really never thought it was anything more than just another movie.  In twenty years, probably the only horror movie to scare me in any way was "The Ring".  I feel no shame in admitting Paranormal Activity did also.I suppose your enjoyment of this film will be highly dependent on how you view it.  For instance, if you're watching this movie on a standard television with a group of friends and everyone's joking about the movie and pulling pranks (normal horror movie stuff) then you will not get much out of this film.On the other hand, you can do like I did and watch this movie alone right when the day turns into twilight and slips into darkness.  In spite of the intentionally low budget feel to the movie, I also believe it is essential you have at least a half-decent surround sound system in order to maximize your enjoyment.  I left all the shades up to let the night in and by the time the movie ended, the house was pitch black and I found myself absolutely terrified.I'm a big-time horror movie buff and don't scare easily.  Try as I might to rationalize the dumb things the characters were doing, I couldn't keep the intense feeling of unease from creeping into me, like a spider crawling up my back.  Even after the movie ended, the frequent noises in my house started to take on an entirely new meaning and sleep was very difficult.  To the director, Oren Peli, I salute you!Yes, it's true you'll either love it or hate it, but if you're going to watch this movie, be a man and watch it alone; and definitely watch it in the dark.

$REVIEW.: I LOVE murder mysteries - and this is a nice example of a competent piece of work and an enjoyable mystery to watch.I LOVE gay-themed movies that show being gay is normal


 And for that I liked this film, but it's not the only reason
 Good acting, good story, believable relationship portrayal


Is this more believable because Chad Allen is GAY? Could be - whatever it is this is a good watch.I did like Chad Allen in this - he played it straight (not in the sense of denying he was gay), showing being married to the same sex is ok (which it damned well is), and you do all the normal stuff like renovating your home and loving your partner, openly dining in a nice restaurant and (horrors) dancing with them on the dance floor in public actually touching and looking like you are loving it.The atmosphere created within the movie with lighting and the story treatment reminds me of the old detective movies - and this is done deliberately

 It has the feel of a 1940's detective story - with old fashioned foot work, fists at midnight (and all the other hours of the day) and quirky
 The modern touch is added with the introduction of the male partner instead of the female moll


 Loving it, I really am.If I am going to criticise - the ending of the detective story part was weak for me

 It annoyed me quite frankly
 But hey, that is just a small part of the satisfying whole
 The ending of the movie is like a satisfied sigh.This is part of a series and the next one "Shock to the System" develops the characters and the storyline improves


 In the next one you get to see the relationship mature, both the on-screen portrayal AND the obvious compatability of the main characters


 Well worth a watch - I pull it out when there is nothing else I want to see...it satisfies, so does "Shock to the System".It is proving to be a nice series, and worth spending the time exploring.

$review_text.: I made a point to watch "The Sugarland Express" because it was listed in "The New York Times Guide to the Best 1000 Movies Ever Made".  I kept looking for a reason why but the only thing I could accept was that this is Steven Spielberg's first movie.  That wasn't good enough for me.  The sets might have been good, the acting acceptable, special effects alright, and the color well-done but this is still a mediocre movie."The Sugarland Express" is apparently based on a true story.  My guess is that 10% may have been for real but the other 90% fiction destroys the case for this "victimized" couple.  Their goal is to break papa out of prison to get baby back from the County Foster Care program.  After watching the antics of mom and pop, reuniting them with junior would constitute child abuse.  After watching the highway patrol's allocation of "necessary force" I felt a renewed respect for the Keystone Kops.  I was never sure if this was supposed to be a comedy.  I was guessing it was but, then, why the supposed morality tale.  Oh well, don't shoot the director, he was meant for bigger (much bigger) and better (much better) things.  Apparently he learned from his mistakes.

$review_text.: "Raise the Red Lantern" offers us a fascinating look at life in early 20th-century China.  It tells us the story of Songlian (Gong Li in her best role to date), 19 years old, harassed by her mother to leave college and marry after her father's death leaves the family impoverished.  If she has to marry, she reasons, she might as well marry a rich man, and heedless of her mother's warnings that she will become little better than a concubine in a rich man's house (or, who knows, perhaps to spite her mother for forcing her to leave school), she becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy businessman.From the start, everything goes wrong.  Even her status in the household as fourth wife is ominous (the number four is considered unlucky in Chinese); she is an independent maverick in a place where she is expected to conform, and she finds herself trapped by the "customs of the house" which must be rigidly adhered to at all times.  With nothing to do to occupy their time, the wives spend their days scheming against each other; the first wife, old and no longer attractive, at least has the status of being the mother of the oldest son; the second wife, jealous of the younger women, plots at their destruction, and the third wife fights against the constraints of her existence by taking the disastrous step of an extramarital affair.Songlian is no match for the forces arrayed against her in this menage; when she tries to assert her place by falsifying a pregnancy and her ruse is discovered, she is relegated to a state of perpetual disgrace.  Shunned by the master of the house and held in contempt by everyone else, ignored even on her birthday, she retaliates by getting drunk and blurting out the secret of the third wife's liaison.  The "customs of the house" demand the ultimate punishment, and the third wife meets the fate which other adulterous wives in the family have met before her.  Songlian is left to go slowly and inexorably insane in this exquisite prison while the master of the house takes yet another wife, this one even younger than she is.Gong Li is incredible as Songlian; she is so stunningly beautiful and such a great actress that she dominates every scene she is in.  The film moves slowly but it's never boring, and although it's shot almost entirely within the confines of the house, the complexities of the building underscore the complexities of the relationship to the master and to each other that the wives are trapped in.  Zhang Yimou has directed other fine films, but Red Lantern is his masterpiece.Judy Lind

$review_text.: Oh how I wanted to give this film five stars. It had me entertained from beginning to end. It has everything a great movie should have: great acting performances, superb dialog, masterful directing, good screenplay with a strong plot, and it's downright entertaining (the most important part). Unfortunately the ending detracted from rest of the movie. Perhaps it's more accurate to call it an epilogue. The movie really ends at the point where the characters are standing outside the hotel. The five minute scene that follows seems pointless and forced. I don't want to detail what happens but it feels like one of those scenes that are added after test audiences disagree with the original ending.Still this is definately one of the best films of 2001 hands down. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.

$review_text.: The reviews that pan these two movies fail to grasp the point that they are supposed to SPOOF the serious plots and action of the Bond movies--not actually "compete with them" (as Flint himself might say)


 I love them both, but my preference is for the sequel--which I find has a quicker pace and better cinematography

 Most of all, "In Like Flint" has Jean Hale, as gorgeous an example of 1960s feminine pulchritude as you'll find in any motion pictture
 I recommend the purchase of this film duo for the sequel's first five minutes alone, which features an absolutely wonderful vision of Ms
Hale in a white midriff, form-fitting white pants, and finally a white jacket


 Guys:  stifle the urge to drool

 Bond girls:  eat your heart out

 Dabney Coleman:  what were you thinking?

$REVIEW.: NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2013The previous year about about a reunion, this year was about establishing the third WWE brand. You saw elements & some talents from the original ECW mixed in with new elements in what was titled "A New Breed Unleashed" as there were some established WWE superstars who were aligned with ECW as well.  All the matches were held under "Extreme Rules" (the new name given to a no rules hardcore match) with Paul Heyman opening the show & Joey Styles doing the commentary to later be joined by Tazz while special appearances from ECW's Sandman, RAW's Eugene & SmackDown's J.B.L. were made throughout the night.  Also as a bonus along with this event is WWE's release of the original ECW's first PPV event in Barely Legal.  Now there are some differences between this & the Pioneer Home Video version in that all the backstage interviews are on here, Shane Douglas' speech is unedited, all non-WWE owned ECW music is removed (no "Enter Sandman"), and some of Joey Styles' commentary is redone.Tazz vs. Jerry Lawler - Nothing much here past it being Tazz's last official match & Jerry "Extremely Crappy Wrestling" Lawler paying for his constant taunting of Joey Styles.Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton - Orton kept going to the outside whenever Angle started to have an the advantage as he was dominate with takedowns & taunts like slapping him across the head while he had him down to the point where Angle even offered his head for Orton to headlock before Orton was finally able to get some momentum due to a mistiming by Kurt leading to a series of countering holds between the two along with exchanging uppercuts.  They traded momentum with Angle heavily relying on suplexes such as 3 germans in a row while Orton delivered his own armdrags & dropkicks as both men continued to counter each other's signature moves such as the AngleSlam, anklelock, top rope crossbody, and RKO.  This was a competitive match between both men as Angle was more serious & resorting to grounded wrestling than we've previously seen him due to his identity as the "Wrestling Machine."Tajiri & Super Crazy vs. F.B.I. - These men met last year in a three way dance & now face off once again but in a tag team match with Tajiri returning to WWE for the first time in months for one night only while Big Guido was in the corner of the F.B.I. with both teams started out with grounded wrestling with such holds as Mamalukes's keylock, Crazy's front face lock, Tajiri's strong kicks, and Guido's fujiarwa armbar takedown.  The action started to pick up with double tree of woe corner dropkicks & an asai moonsault onto multiple people on the outside with the speed picking up & the hits getting harder such as Tajiri kicking the legs out from under & one guy knocked into the front row along with various double teaming including double tarantulas & fisherman's buster.  This was a fast paced hard hitting encounter but stay tuned as the newest member of the ECW roster (complete with long overdue new theme music) was the last man standing.World Champion Rey Mysterio vs. Sabu - You had a clue where this match was going with both men had a dueling chairs battle early as they were able to use the chair in ways such as a springboard for a leg lariat & frankensteiner, drop toe hold into it, and just having it launched straight at the head before both men went aerial with moves like a top rope moonsault, second rop legdrop, springboard leg lariat, triple jump moonsault, Sabu's arabian facebuster with a chair & Mysterio's seated senton through a table while both men showing why it's called "high risk" as they didn't always connect with their aerial offense & one attempted maneuver ended up sending both men through a table on the outside.  This was built up as a dream match between both men highly known for their high risk aerial offensive which they did showcase here while implementing the elements of the chairs & tables as well with the only real negative here being the finish.[ECW: Extreme Rules]Tommy Dreamer, Terry Funk, Beulah vs. Edge, Mick Foley, Lita - It was during this time that Foley had aligned himself with Edge & Lita to the point where they resurrected the retired Hardcore Championship & declared themselves co-champions but this originally scheduled tag match was turned into a six "person" tag when Beulah challenged Lita after she kept getting involved in the prior weeks while Foley came into the match with a black eye thanks to Funk & did a funny pre-match promo referring to a period in the history ECW that all the fans truly hated. All four men started brawling both in the ring & on the floor with various weapons coming into play such as a cookie sheet, Dreamer doing a baseball sliding a trash can into Foley & Dreamer hip tossed onto a ladder by Edge before Funk did his classic airplane spin with the ladder before Foley pulled out a barbed wire board that came into effect as everyone took a hit into this board at one point. Edge & Foley got very violent using the divide & conquer strategy using the barbed wire to have Funk bleeding from the eye, Dreamer taking "Barbie" between the legs, and even Beulah getting a taste of Mr. Socko but they fought back resulting in Foley being on fire with both him & Funk falling into the barbed wire board, Dreamer using the a barbed wire crossface, the traditional ECW "catfight" before things ended in a pin attempt that was so sleazy that even the referee went "what the hell are you doing?" This match was the EXTREME violence you would expect from a show with the letters "ECW" attached to it.[Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses: Hardcore Edition; ECW: Extreme Rules; Edge: Decade Of Decadance]Balls Mahoney vs. Masato Tatanka - Tanaka came out with his right shoulder taped up with Balls starting out in control with a powerslam & series of punches before they eventually ended up on the outside fighting & back in the ring exchanging superplexes before reliving their infamous "dueling chairs" battle.  This was too short to make anything relevant.WWE Champion John Cena vs. Rob Van Dam - Rob Van Dam came in to a hero's reception while Cena was booed out of the building to the point where the crowd showed that they refused to anything to do with him while you clearly saw the sign of "If Cena Wins, We Riot!" & the crowd being very vocal about his lack of wrestling ability & staleness.  Both men hit some big moves in the first part of the match like the cradle suplex & a big sidekick & trading fist before taking the match to the outside with Cena dropping a top rope axe hammer to RVD on the outside only for RVD to respond with a moonsault press off the guardrail followed by fighting in the crowd.  Both men began taking things to the extreme bringing a chair into the match for various offense like RVD's skateboard into the corner & Rolling Thunder on onto the chair while Cena used it for a DDT & catapulting RVD directly into it as they continued to trade momentum countering each other's offense with things starting to get more out of control with the referee getting too emotionally involved, steel steps & a table involved in the match, and men who had both issues & alliances with the participants getting involved as well.  While this match is mostly remembered for the crowd reactions & the result, the match itself was really good as both men played off each other very well.[John Cena: My Life](Bonus Match) WWE vs. ECW Battle Royal - This was a 10 man battle royal that had 10 members of each team competing against each other with the last team standing being the winners in a nice battle royal but really wasn't anything really special past Edge being the "ultimate opportunist" lurking on the outside & getting involved on the apron but never officially entering the ring so we wouldn't get eliminated but this all about how "ECW had no idea what it's going to get" in the end."WWE vs. Head: Head To Head" June '06(Barely Legal) Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Eliminators - Dudleys attacked from behind after Sign Guy helped with a distraction (and payed for it) with them hitting some hard hitting moves like the Bubba Bomb & diving headbutt before Eliminators started making a comeback using their educated feet for various kicks & aerial offense such as the moonsault & various splash from either a backflip or 450 position along with executing both kicks & splashes from a springboard position.  This was a hot opening match that saw both teams showcase their array of offense with Eliminators diverse offensive style leaving an impression.(Barely Legal) Lance Storm vs. Rob Van Dam - This was originally suppose to be Chris Candido vs. Lance Storm but RVD replaced Candido after he suffered an injury with Storm always remaining one step ahead in the early exchanges before RVD was finally able to catch him before both men had an aerial attack with holds like the leaping somersault dive, top rope back elbow, and moonsault press on the outside. RVD got more aggressive to the point where he brought a chair into play & threw it in Storm's face quick like a bullet followed by the running chair dropkick in the corner & frog splash but Storm kept fighting back catching him in submissions like the boston crab into a single crab before using the chair himself for holds like a Tiger Bomb & top rope legdrop onto the open chair. This was a solid match & they would go on to have better quality matches as Storm still wasn't comfortable with the ECW environment yet (as you could tell by the chairshots he gave) but this was more about the infamous speech afterwords where RVD addressed the crowds chants of "You Sold Out!"[Rob Van Dam: One Of A Kind](Barely Legal) Great Sasuke, Gran Hamaada, Masato Yakushij vs. bWo International (Taka Michinoku, Mens Teioh, Dick Togo) - This was a representation of the working relationship with Michinoku Pro Wrestling promotion in Japan to the point where Taka's team were the international members of the bWo.  The bWo started out with double & triple teaming offense while also taking to time to keep posing & taunting their opponents while Teioh was able to showcase his power with moves like the delayed vertical suplex but the other team was able to make a comeback with very fast paced offense such as a baseball side into head scissors takeover on the floor & Sasuke countering a powerbomb into frankensteiner & later a double clothesline into a moonsault press.  They traded momentum constantly with Teioh showing his strength like countering a hip toss into a DDT & later delivering a chokeslam into a powerbomb, Hamada with a top rope frankensteiner, Taka's missle dropkick to the back of the head, Sasuke with a mid-air dropkick, and the bWo continuing to double & triple team including a spike piledriver & triple man powerbomb.  This was very fast paced high speed athletic action from start to finish.(Barely Legal) Television Champion Shane Douglas vs. Pitbull #2 - This match had a special stipulation that the masked man who had been taunting Douglas for months would unmask himself if Douglas wins as Pitbull #1 was sitting in the front row while Douglas & Francine was escorted to the ring by a riot squad.  Pitbull #2 used power moves like clotheslines & spinkicks while trying to work over his neck from a front facelock & wrenching side headlock but Douglas was able to recover & work over Pitbull's neck with moves like the snapmare, a dropkick to the of the head, and camel clutch before Pitbull was able to launch Douglas over the top rope & through a table when Pitbull #1 made his presence known as Douglas continued to use dirty tactics along with weapons like the guardrail & a chair however Pitbull #2 continued to keep shaking off the pain with power moves like the shoulder block & powerslam causing Douglas & Francine resort to almost every single dirty tactic & weapon they could including breaking a piece of board over his head twice & Chris Candido making an appearance.  This told a good story in regards to both men focusing on each other's necks at one point along with Douglas throwing everything but the kitchen sink thrown at Pitbull who was refusing to fail but the biggest story of the match wasn't just who was the guy that was taunting Douglas for months but who was the guy under the mask that night.(Barely Legal) Sabu vs. Taz - This was called "The Grudge Match Of The Century" as this match was build for over a year dating back to their issues going on 2 years earlier to the point where Sabu came straight to the ring without his typical entrance. Both men went back & forth wrestling with Taz even daring Sabu to take his leg at one point before catching him in a body scissors with vicious crossfaces that ended up breaking Sabu's nose. Sabu used this daredevil offense like the double jump springboard into the crowd followed by brawling in the audience while Taz was sticking to this wrestling like the freestyle bow & arrow stretch while also countering Sabu's offense like throwing Sabu off a swinging DDT attempt that sent Sabu through a table. Taz made his clear that he was going after Sabu's previously injured neck with his various Tazplexes that landed Sabu directly on it while even Sabu tried to beat Taz at his own game applying the Tazmission at one point. This did come off as a grudge match with how hard & stiff each other were going after each other but it was the aftermath that had everyone talking as it changed both men's careers forever.[ECW Unreleased Vol. 1; ECW: Extreme Revolution](Barely Legal) Terry Funk vs. Sandman vs. Stevie Richards - Tommy Dreamer & Beulah joined Joey Styles on commentary for this match with the winner getting a shot against ECW Champion Raven afterwords.  Sandman was in control in the early part of the match by making teams with both men at one point only to betray his partner right away before going to the back & tossing a ladder tossed into the ring nailing Funk in the head & it continuing to be used as a weapon such as suplexing it onto Stevie, Funk attempting a moonsault off the top of it, Sandman coming off the top rope with it onto Stevie & later tossing it onto Stevie on the floor, the classic Funk airplane spin, and Stevie using it as a see-saw on Funk & Sandman.  More weapons came into a play such a trash can wrapped in sheet metal that nailed Funk in the head when tossed in the ring & Stevie suplexed on top of it along with barbed wire that Funk used to whip & Sandman later wrapped himself in it as a human battery ram while all three men continued to beat the hell out of each other in what was definitely an "extreme" triple threat match between all three leading to....[Bloodsport: ECW's Most Dangerous Matches](Barely Legal) ECW Champion Raven vs. Terry Funk - ...this match with Raven attacking right away with the championship & eventually busting Funk open with Raven continuing to attack that cut while also driving Funk through a table on the outside as Raven's nest came out to inflict more damage while also taunting Dreamer at the announce table causing Dreamer to take matters into his own hand.  The match wasn't much due to time restraints limiting what they could do but it was all about the emotional moment of if Terry Funk's could complete his comeback & become champion.[Bloodsport: ECW's Most Dangerous Matches]One Night Stand would go on to be the last great PPV under the ECW banner & in many ways the last true sign of what fans remembered what the original ECW was as we would see the direction the brand would go to & later ended up being reduced to over the course of the next 4 years as the show had good wrestling & hardcore action mixed together well.  All of this along with the bonus of the Barely Legal PPV makes this set in itself going out of your way to see.

$review_text.: It's amazing, really, to see how the whole world went ga-ga over "Piates" this past year

From a Hollywood dirty word, to a hot-hot-hot property, pirate films are "IT" now


I must admit I wasn't too sure about this film
I loved the first film, "The Curse of the Black Pearl", but I knew it was a stand-alone piece, while the next two films in the series were meant as a two-parter
Meaning, of course, that there would be no real ending to the second film, only a lead-in to the third
That said, I enjoyed this film

There is a noticeably darker tone right off the bat, which never lets up, even in the lighter moments
From the ruined wedding to the cannibalistic natives to the evil Davey Jones himself, not to mention the darker side shown to miss Elizabeth Swann and the fall from grace of Commodore Norrington


True, the critcs were not kind to the movie, and yes the plot does meander all over

Again, the film is saved by the performance of Johnny Depp as CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow

One watches and really wonders if he is really that bad, or is he hiding a heart of tainted gold under all those swaggers and innuendoes? Whatever the case, Johnny Depp is mesmerizing in the role
You simply can't take your eyes off him


Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom give more rounded performances this time around, and Jack Davenport is much more intrigueing this time around as Norrington on the fast track downward
The films effects are top-notch, almost overwhelming


At times, it seemed that the director just thought of something else to pop in and wrote a scene for it

There are some excessive scenes, but also some tender ones as well

The scenes between Will Turner and his father, Boot Strap, are well done

All in all, this movie isn't as well-conceived as the first one, but it is entertaining, and does get you ready for the third film, the series finale
Certainly, the surprise at the end caught me off-guard, and has me ready for the wrap-up! Yo-Ho-HO!

$review_text.: First off, the piano playing is suberb.  Lang Lang, like most of the new breed of classical concert pianists, has no problem wrestling with the black monster of flashing white teeth.  He is "master of his domain."  He's also a somewhat self-indulgent puppy; a "saucy baggage," as the Elizabethans might put it.  This makes his concerts a great deal of fun.  The splashy Don Giovanni reminiscences are whipped up into a fine Lisztean lather.  And yet, and yet. . . the Schumann "Traumerei" encore is simple and immensely touching.  Carnegie Hall is absolutely still, time has stopped.  This young man is going to be really impressive as he matures, if he doesn't lose his way.  The camera work is a bit ho-hum, but I don't know what the restrictions are in Carnegie Hall.  Lang Lang's facial contortions really bother some viewers.  I don't believe he is really conscious of them.  And what does it matter?  This is playing with heart on sleeve.  The program is a little unfocussed: a grab-bag of Schumann, Schubert, Haydn, Tan Dun, and Liszt.  He introduces his father for one of the encores:  I bet that's a first for Carnegie Hall.  Deutsche Grammaphon really hypes their stable: the featurettes are doting, cloying, almost obscenely adoring.  Well, I guess the company's got to make a buck.  Anyway, recommended on the whole.

Redford works for the CIA reading books, lots of books and stumbles across something that he should not have.  So some corrupt officials want to eliminate Redford and the small book reading group.  Redford survives the initial attempt and the rest of the movie is about him evading the bad guys.

The actors did a good job with the material they had.

$REVIEW.: I had some reservations before seeing FEARLESS that Jet Li wasn't going to end his career in martial arts epics on the right note


Given that UNLEASHED was so phenomenal (the opening fight is by itself worth the price of admission), I was afraid that Jet Li has sapped away all the good stuff he had left to offer in the genre before his grand finale.Boy, was I wrong


FEARLESS is everything a martial arts epic should be
It has all the trademark elements Jet Li has made himself famous for

Playing a real-life Chinese folk-hero (Hou yuan-jia, although Li and director Ronny Yu have taken considerable liberties with the man's story), whose main goal is to defend China's honor against occupying Western powers, while at the same time, promoting a peaceful co-existance between the two.FEARLESS is, in my analysis, what CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON would have been like if Li had accepted Chow yun-fat's role

At 43, he has all the agility, blinding speed, and acrobatic grace he had when entered the genre over 20 years ago


every battle in the film is like watching a live wushu demonstration, and never at any point boring (the fight on top of the 150-ft

platform is especially good.)Jet Li's comments that this will be his final martial arts film appear to have been misinterpreted


He has since clarified that he is now officially retired from WUSHU films and epic films, but that he will continue to make action and kung fu movies (he seems to have made good on that promise, as he has already completed his next kung fu action thriller WAR, with TRANSPORTER star Jason Statham, and is in preparation for a co-production with - yep - Jackie Chan.)So let's accept that this is, as black belt magazine has put it, "his last ponytail epic", and I must say that he could not have bowed ought of that genre more graceful

Through FEARLESS and his many other "ponytail epics", Jet Li has shown himself to be almost the personification of Bruce Lee's philosophy of flowing like water.

$No. helps.: [4, 5] $SUMMARY.: Whether it's his last martial arts or WUSHU film, it's bound to be a classic

$review_text.: Chick Flick Alert! "Den skaldede frisr" (English captions) is a Danish film about a hairdresser who has been fighting breast cancer


After a partial mastectomy and chemo, she gets the all-clear, but comes home only to discover her husband having a fling with a co-worker
Problem is, next week they are flying from Denmark to Italy for their daughter's wedding


Of course Dean Martin's "That's Amore" underscores the opening credits.Writer Suzanne Bier ("After the Wedding" - terrific by the way!) directed this award-winning romance that features:* Trine Dyrholm ("The Royal Affair") is Ida, the bald hairdresser (nice wig though) who has to confront one serious upset after another


She's the mother of the bride.* Pierce Brosnan ("The Ghost Writer") is Philip, a highly successful international trader of fresh fruits and vegetables

It's his Italian villa where the wedding party convenes


He's the widowed father of the groom.* Sebastian Jessen ("Almost Perfect") is Patrick, the groom...but he's starting to wonder....* Molly Blixt Egelind ("Rebounce") is Astrid, the bride
The groom's wondering is making her start to wonder...* Paprika Steen ("Keep the Lights On") is Benedikte, the worst sister-in-law EVER!Things get off to a bad start when the mother of the bride backs her car into the father of the groom's car at the airport in Copenhagen


Then they are on the same flight but HER luggage gets lost


Finally, her wandering husband brings along his new sweetheart to Italy because she missed her flight back to Denmark


(She introduces herself as his "fianc&eacute;e.")I'll bet you have it all figured out, don't you? Well, you don't


I love it when things become unpredictable, and they do! Expect no sweaty bodies, gunshots, vehicular mayhem or blowie uppie stuff

In fact the biggest villain is that philandering husband.BTW, Brosnan just gets more appealing as the years go by
He's far better now than when he was 'Bond'ing with the world


Yum! Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available.

$review_text.: This set's a great buy with the original 1933 "King Kong" being the stand-out

 Kong looks and sounds great especially for a film of that vintage whose original negative has been long lost
 There's detail and clarity to the images that I've never seen before--check out the introduction to the island natives and the kong skulls carved into the decor.The extras on the DVD are numerous and mind blowing!  My favorite extra is a lost sequence recreated in black and white by director Peter Jackson


 It's a fantastic treat that makes the DVD worth owning just for this."King Kong" stands as one of the greatest adventure films in  history.The sequel "Son of Kong" is not comparable to the original, but it's short and zippy and little Kong is adorable and beautifully animated

 The DVD image and sound is even better than that of "King Kong"
 A trailer is the only extra."Might Joe Young" is a favorite from my childhood

 It's got some truly ingenious sequences especially the amazing orphanage finale
 The DVD image is the best of the set--pristine and gorgeous


 The disc has a trailer, a good featurette and a fine commentary by Ray Harryhausen as well.

If you love opera, &quot;Aria&quot; will not appeal to you
I had been warned about this anthology film, but wanted to see it for the Robert Altman  segment

Out of respect for the great director, I'll just say that his  segment is no better or worse than any of the dreck that surrounds it
The  movie is pretentious and dull, almost unwatchable save for Franc Roddam's  interesting Las Vegas episode.

$review_text.: This television miniseries focuses on Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis and does have a tendency to overplay the 'villains' (the portrayals of Aristotle and Christina Onassis are completely baffling unless you know more about Jackie's complex relationships with the Onassis camp) and underplay several key aspects of her life (Jack Kennedy's infidelity, the tempestuous relationship with her mother, the estrangement from Aristotle). It has never been advertised or represented as a documentary and while many aspects of her life are either dramatized or shoved to the side, Joanne Whalley does carry herself off well as Jackie throughout the years.  Using a combination of tenacity and tenderness, she shows us the ups and downs of a life lived mainly (though mostly unwillingly) in the public eye.  The real Mrs. Onassis was a tall woman, but Joanne Whalley carries herself with true style, bringing forth a portrayal of an American icon with style, sophistication and wit.  She's a very talented lady and this could not have been an easy role for her to take on.For a more complete and historically accurate telling of the Camelot years and of Mrs. Onassis in general, PBS' American Experience aired the excellentThe American Experience: The Kennedysas well as dedicating a separate episode toJackie - Behind the Myth

$review_text.: In Enough, Jennifer Lopez stars as Slim, a waitress who meets a charming, rich contractor named Mitch. In no time, they're married, living a beautiful home and have a daughter. They have a perfect life. Until about four years later when Slim discovers Mitch is having an affair. He tells her that men and women have different needs and his mistress takes care of his, but he still wants to be with Slim. When she protests and says she will not tolerate his infidelity, Mitch begins beating her up.She realizes she needs to leave to save herself and her daughter. But it's not that easy. Mitch relentlessly chases them and Slim soon takes matters into her own hands.This is such a suspenseful, exciting and thrilling movie. I've seen all of Jennifer's films, and I must say she is at her best in Enough. She truly gave an amazing performance that will make people notice she is a good actress. I also must applaud Billy Campbell (Mitch) for a convincing portrayal, too.Highly recommended!

Reese Witherspoon's character &quot;Elle&quot; is a sweet, funny, smart and completely likeable character and has you caring for her and rooting for her to win and prove everyone wrong. After being dumped by her boyfriend Warner because he thought she wasn't smart enough for a future lawyer or senator, she follows him to Harvard determined to win him back. While she struggles with fitting in, she slowly wins over several of her classmates, and proves she is no dumb blonde. This movie is fun, and well worth seeing.

Having the Russians speak English but using subtitles for the Afghans was a meaningless ploy to me.  The cast did well with their roles, but at times the sound was so low, I couldn't understand what the Russians were saying and I got tired of reading the contrived subtitles.

$review_text.: While there are some who may remember the 1985 horror film "Fright Night" written by Tom Holland, and its sequel in 1988, with many remakes of popular horror films happening more and more, what happens if the task of writing a screenplay is given to "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel" writer Marti Noxon?Let's just say that while not a horror/slasher type of film, you do get the humor that was quite prevalent in those popular TV series that Noxon was involved with and also the feeling of a homage to the Scooby Gang than redoing the same kind of film that was released in '85.  And director Craig Gillespie doing something different than his previous films "Lars and the Real Girl", "Mr. Woodcock" and the TV series "United States of Tara".Also, unlike the earlier film's, this latest adaptation would benefit from better visual effects but also a change in storyline compared to the original film.  Where the original focused on a horror fan of the TV series "Fright Night" and an actor who played a vampire killer, there are differences that keep the original 1985 film original and this 2011 version is a different type of film that uses the character's names, modernizes the storyline and is essentially a different film.While the film wasn't a major hit in the box office, it did receive many positive reviews from film critics.  And for fans of "Buffy the Vampire" and "Angel", because of Noxon's involvement, there was a little homage to those series in the film, as well as to the original film that made fans interested and entertained.  And also to "Doctor Who" fans who love David Tennant's work as the doctor and want to see him play the vampire hunter, Peter Vincent.VIDEO:"Fright Night" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The Picture quality is fantastic!  There are a lot of detail's that can be seen, from the detail on the clothing, the weapons, the blood on the characters.  Plenty of detail can be seen in this film from Amy's blue eyes, the detail on the CG of Jerry's vampire face, the edges and contour of Peter Vincent's collection and more! Also, it helps to have a talented cinematographer, Javier Aguirresarobe ("The Others", "Twilight: New Moon", "The Twilight Saga: Elclipse", "Vicky Cristina Barcelona") working on the film.  Javier does a wonderful job in capturing the action sequences with complete efficacy!Skin tones are natural, black levels are deep and no artifacts, banding (especially during the more fire and red intensive scenes) or traces of DNR.  This is an awesome looking film on Blu-ray!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:"Fright Night" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), English 2.0 DVS, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  What an immersive soundtrack!  I was so happy to hear the rear surrounds being used in this film, I was very impressed!  While the film starts out with a lot of dialogue and is crystal clear through the center channel and also ambient effects and music through the front channel, the movie builds with noises from glass being broken, to the scream of Doris but once you get into the action sequences featuring Charley, Amy and his mother being pursued by Jerry, the film becomes immersive!From the sounds of a motorcycle hitting the back window, Jane running straight into Jerry and the vampire trying to come from below in order to kill his victims or the scrape of metal as it hits the pavement.  From this point on to the film, the film is so immersive because of the continual action sequences that I really enjoyed this lossless soundtrack.  Action kept going and going, ambiance via the club or crowds is heard clearly.  If anything, audio quality like the video is fantastic!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES"Fright Night" comes with the following special features:Peter Vincent: Come Swim in My Mind - (2:09) An interview with Peter Vincent (the character played by David Tennant).The Official "How to Make a Funny Vampire Movie" Guide - (8:04) Craig Gillespie, Marti Noxon and the producers and cast talk about necessary things to have in a vampire film.Deleted & Extended Scenes - (4:51) Featuring five deleted scenes: Ride to School, Neighborly, Once a Freak Always a Freak, Midori & Kerosene and Back at the Penthouse.Squidman: Extended and Uncut - (2:58) Featuring the extended, uncut version of the squidman home video that Charley and his friends took when they were younger.Bloopers - (3:23) Outtakes from "Fright Night".Kid Cudi - "No One Believes Me" Music Video - (5:21)EXTRAS:"Fright Night" comes with a slipcover case and DVD with feature film and special features.  The DVD is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) aspect ratio - enhanced for 169 televisions.  Audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital, English 2.0 DVS, French, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.JUDGMENT CALL:While I'm not so fond of '70s and '80s horror films because they still continue to scare the hell out of me... "Fright Night" is one of those horror films that may have some scares but by no means is it a horror, slasher film or anything that is overly grotesque.In fact, when I found out that Marti Noxon wrote the screenplay and that Craig Gillespie was directing, I wasn't thinking of horror film.  Knowing Noxon's style of writing for "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and the "Angel" TV series, she is a writer that tries to bring together comedy, horror but also gives things a more stylish presentation for today's viewers.  While Craig Gillespie is also a character driven director and both working together was actually quite effective.In some ways, minus Joss Whedon and the fact that fans have wished on a real "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel" movie since the TV series had ended, this 2011 version of "Fright Night" almost felt like an extension of those series.  A homage to those Whedon TV series that a lot of us grew up watching way before "Twilight" and the other countless vampire related films and TV series that are currently ongoing.And I can easily say that because Marti Noxon wrote the screenplay, was a major incentive of me wanting to watch this film because I knew I was not going to have a bloody horrorfest but a film that will be action-packed and entertaining!  While it will be quite subjective for those who saw the original 1985 film and this 2011 version of which is better and which is not, I'm more on the latter side, that I enjoyed this 2011 film a lot!First, Colin Farrell does a fantastic job of playing the antagonist, Jerry the vampire.  You know that he is the bad boy that the women are going to fall for and also the actor does a great job of playing the villain!  Anton Yelchin looks like the underdog.  As Charley, a kid we don't expect much from in defending his family, yet himself from a vampire attack, so you root for the underdog.  Especially for his girlfriend Amy (played by Imogen Poots) and his mother Jane (Toni Collette).But also having David Tennant (which alone will have "Dr. Who" fans excited) as the vampire hunter, Peter Vincent was a big plus!  Especially to have Tennant play this bombastic character, so different from Roddy McDowall's 1985 performance.  If anything, Tennant made this rude and aggressive character his own.But also to having this film set in Las Vegas to help explain the Peter Vincent, Vampire Hunter show and also why Jerry has blacked-out windows (because people in Las Vegas work at nights and sleep during the day), works well for this film.But one advantage that the 2011 version film has its technology and it's talented crew behind it.  Aside from Gillespie and Noxon, for cinematography, you have "Twilight: New Moon" and "The Twilight Saga: Eclipse" cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe, art director Randy Moore ("The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", "G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra", "The Mask"), costume designer Susan Matheson ("The Kingdom", "The Town", "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"), production designer Richard Bridgland ("Resident Evil", "AVP: Alien vs. Predator"), Set decorator K.C. Fox ("Speed", "Forgetting Sarah Marshall", "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo") and many more.  DreamWorks Pictures really tapped into a talented crew for this 2011 version of the film.As for the Blu-ray release, the picture quality and lossless audio is fantastic!  I wish there was an audio commentary but you still get a good number of special features included with this Blu-ray release.  And also, with this Blu-ray release, you get a DVD feature of the film, so since this will be released before Christmas, something people can watch during those long travel commutes or during winter vacation.Overall, "Fright Night" is not so much of a horror film.  If you have watched a "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" or "Angel" episode, you know it's about comedy, its characters and of course, these characters trying to survive from vampires.  While the original definitely had hints of a sequel toward the end, this 2011 film did not. But then again, with so much interest in vampire films and vampire television shows, I wouldn't be surprised if more "Fright Night" films would be made.If so, I hope it retains the same type of vibe as the 2011 version as I do love what Marti Noxon has brought to the original screenplay.  Especially with so many horror films coming out each year, it's great to have something not too banal in which you have a vampire film that is not all about the horror but a screenplay that manages to have fun and not having main characters dying off like other films.Overall, "Fright Night" is an enjoyable, entertaining action-based, vampire film, it may not be scary enough for others...but for those who want to laugh and also enjoy the characters of the film, this one is for you!

 I love the extras, my only complaint is that I would have loved a commentary track or just more special features including the actors.I am an actress myself, and interested in the choices that Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes seemed to make so effortlessly


 Some commentary from them would give the extras here some balance (as it is, most of the commentary and extras are focused on the direction and writing.)Either way, the movie is great and the extras aren't too bad.

He does have a confused and gentle side that only one person can see. Tomoe encounters Kenshin Himura and witnesses a battle. After seeing that they become closer and eventually open up to each other. After a crushing defeat Kenshin and Tomoe are sent into hiding. They begin to live a normal life together. After a few years pass, and things seem normal, a messenger comes and tells them things are getting worse. Tomoe betrays Kenshin and returns home. He is not going to accept this. Kenshin then goes after her. But to save her he must battle Tomoe's father. During the fight the unthinkable happens, and the legend of Rurouni Kenshin begins.This is the beginning of the Rurouni Kenshin legend. It is much darker that the TV series. Kenshin is much more of a soulless killer than you were led to believe in the TV show. The animation and voice acting are also different. This show seems like it was made by completely different people. It is very good, and gives ou a new perspective on the TV show. I recommend it to any fan of the Rurouni Kenshin series.

Deals with a woman (Stanwyck) who is widowed at an early age with two early teen boys in the upper-class Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, IL. She's expected, not only by society but her socialite mother (played to perfection by Lucille Watson), to follow a path of strict decorum that many widows were expected to follow back in those days. However, Stanwyck decides to throw away alot of those old practices and pave the way for herself and stumbles upon a brash, handsome and suitable Army officer (George Brent)for frindship and romance. Needless to say all does not settle well with mother (Watson) or her social community. Thank God best friend Eve Arden is their for support. Good script, solid acting by all

$review_text.: Wagner's 1850 vision of rapturous stillness, the ecstasy of love and of the strange and terrible beauty that is barely discernable in the eternal silence that rounds our lives, has often been one of the most difficult of his operas to stage
Rudolph Kempe's brilliant 1964 recording on EMI is still the finest recorded version available of this deeply mystical work
Wagner perfected the technique of sonically weaving a cosmic stage upon which human passions play out in his later masterpieces, especially Tristan and Parsifal, but Lohengrin is the headwater of much of his greatest later artistry.Film director Werner Herzog staged this production under the watchful eye of Bayreuther Festspiele artistic director (and Wagner grandson), Wolfgang Wagner

Herzog was given his marching orders: this production must stay in the repertoire a minimum of five years - "so no trendy antics." By blending the most modern and up-to-date theater technology: smoke, lasers, film back projection, with a deeply traditional stage production, Herzog has essentially created a late 20th century version of a 19th century picture-book world that romantically recreates the primitive 10th century northern-European setting


Nothing exemplifies this more than Lohengrin's sudden, heroic swan-borne entrance through a scrim of laser light and smoke


The effect is electrifying as it is perfectly timed to Wagner's powerful music

Moments such as these work brilliantly in combination with the magnificent sound and exemplary performance of the Bayreuther Festspiele

This time travel telescoping of three temporal sensibilities, crisply focuses (into a slightly more Earthbound vision) Wagner's occasional over-reaching for mythic effects, the very thing that makes his operas so difficult to stage coherently


That is one of this production's greatest strengths, and is well worth a recommendation for that fact alone.The cast stars Paul Frey as Lohengrin, Manfred Schenk as King Henry the Fowler, and Cheryl Studer as Elsa von Brabant
The orchestra is conducted by Peter Schneider


Their performances are superb, heightened by Bayreuth's absolutely resplendant acoustics


Every note bursts from the stage with a warmth and clarity fostered by the now 150 year old wood from which the stage is constructed

The orchestra, which plays from beneath the covered pit, is similarly rewarded: Wagner's brilliant writing for the brasses is given a warmth and reverberant fullness of tone that is slightly recessed and softened by the wood covering
Unique in the opera world, Bayreuth's stunning acoustics provides an aura of distance, increasing the other-worldly quality of Wagner's music, an effect that is perfect for his operas.Brilliantly directed by Brian Large, the DVD was filmed in June 1990 and looks crystal clear in this remastered version that runs for 214 minutes

The sound in both PCM stereo and DTS 5.1 is full, rich and life-like


There are the usual DGG menus and translations


A booklet is enclosed.A blend of traditional staging with new technology, all in the service of a splendid artistic conception, makes this Lohengrin a fine investment for fans of this opera
Most strongly recommended.Mike Birman

$REVIEW.: Wow.No movie has ever drawn me into so much spiritual introspection as this one.The fundamental question is not politics, as would seem the superficial plot. It is about Man and God.It is about how we react to  adversity, to violence against ourselves, against those we love. It is  about what should be protected, and to what point do we protect what we  love.

$REVIEW.: this is a cool little scifi/horror movie
 i heard about this movie from the exploitation book Nightmare USA

 The Deadly Spawn wasn't as epic as i hoped it might be, but it surely didn't disappoint me either.some shots, special effects, and gushes of blood were downright inspired!  a couple scenes came off flat and one dialog scene was a little blurry, plus i could tell in a couple spots where the production had been rushed


 i heard that the vegetarian party was phenomenal and to me it seemed just OK
 also, the ending didn't really thrill me


 hence the 4 stars.ia ia,Venger As'Nas SatanisCult of Cthulhu High Priest

$REVIEW.: Only the artsy people would give this five stars, or maybe the Irish (it's an Irish film.)If I am too "American" to enjoy this, so be it.  I don't mind the well-placed F word for emphasis, but the F word was part of every other statement (they left them out of the captions.)  Yeah, I know, I have heard that it's a meaningless word in other parts of the world, but I am here, not there.Guess I don't like movies about bully, corrupt cops much, and since the main character was unlikeablely so, we stopped watching after fifteen minutes.  Maybe it did get better, but if a book or movie hasn't grabbed my interest in the first fifteen, forget it!

The hardest part was listening to my daughter, in the back seat, enjoying the first episode on the drive home.Excellent quality, apart from flashbacks to the miniseries - they seem a bit washed out.

$REVIEW.: You have to hand it to Greek director Nico Mastorakis: in a lengthy interview included on the DVD version of his 1975 exploitation classic "Island of Death," he blatantly admits that he created this movie in order to make money. After viewing "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" in Europe, Mastorakis knew he could create something comparable to the upsetting images he saw on the screen. Shortly after this event, he sat down and wrote the script for "Island of Death," intentionally imbuing it with the most shocking and nauseating of situations. The difference between Mastorakis and the majority of exploitation directors is that this Greek knows how to direct a film. "The Island of Death" is not so much a gritty movie as it is a series of striking contrasts captured beautifully on film. Don't get me wrong; it is sure to deliver a few jolts to even the most hardened of horror fans, with its over the top sadism and blas&eacute; attitude about violence.Two British tourists named Christopher and Celia arrive on the Greek island of Mykonos in order to see the sights and rub elbows with the locals. Christopher likes the island because it has 350 churches spread across the landscape, meaning that the people on the island are especially religious. This perceived religiosity of the locals gives Christopher and Celia the idea that people of loose moral standards and questionable backgrounds aren't welcome. Therefore, Christopher decides Mykonos is the perfect place to start a personal pogrom against the local degenerates. The two embark on a bloody rampage of bizarre violence against select segments of the population by torturing, mutilating, and killing a French painter, two homosexuals, a lesbian, and a woman who sleeps around. Christopher is definitely the ringleader in these appalling crimes, and since he considers himself an angel of God sent to restore decency to the world, there exists not a whit of guilt about the crimes committed by the couple. For some inexplicable reason, Celia and Christopher tote a camera around with them in order to capture the carnage on film so they can gloat about their acts afterwards in the privacy of their rented cottage. Despite the fact that there is a private detective on their tail, Chris and Celia possess little reservations about upping the body count. Predictably, there exists a bit of a twist ending that really doesn't come as much of a shock in this type of film. Let's just say that one of the two get their comeuppance in the final scenes.A lot of hype surrounds this film. The fact that Britain banned its release for many years seems to fuel many people's desire to see it. After viewing "The Island of Death," I readily understood why British censors balked at giving this one a pass. At least one sexual situation involves an activity more suited to a fetish film, but overall, Mastorakis skimps on excessive blood and gore. We see the killings and tortures, but the camera usually cuts away before any serious sauce flows. The disturbing elements of the film don't come from great special effects; rather, it's the idea of seeing someone forced to drink whitewash, die by hanging off a moving plane, receive a bath in lime, and have their face burned with flaming aerosol. The crude crucifixion performed on the hapless painter certainly didn't give those censors any breathing room, either. So, for those interested in "The Island of Death" because they think it is loaded with gore, you have been alerted that this film does not contain much in the way of substantial grue.I wrote that this picture is a series of striking contrasts, and that's because the island of Mykonos is a gorgeously picturesque backdrop for the nightmare unfolding in the camera's foreground. The smartly whitewashed houses, the narrow streets, the lapping waves, the bright blue skies, and the wide-open fields look great while presenting a troubling contrast to the atrocities committed by Christopher and Celia. This is where the picture quality of the DVD comes in: the transfer is splendid; with colors so vivid it feels as though you are on the island itself. Mastorakis's use of background coupled with imaginative camera angles creates a truly memorable film experience. There are few horror/exploitation films with the type of marvelous cinematography found in "Island of Death." Add in the unusual soundtrack, and you have yourself a winner here.Still, this movie is a rather low budget number, with some awkward acting and jarring edits that disturb the flow of the film. The lack of gore is disappointing for hardcore gorehounds such as myself (as if the disgusting subject matter isn't enough!), but overall I really enjoyed this movie. The interview with Mastorakis, who comes across as a friendly chap, illuminates many of the finer points of the film, providing a sort of mini-commentary track conveying lots of information on the production of the film, the actors, and the critical reactions to the project. The only other extras on the disc are music videos of the songs in the movie. "Island of Death" may not approach the levels of offensiveness found in such classics as "Cannibal Holocaust" or "Salo," but it is still a grimly effective little picture capable of clearing a packed movie theater if it chose to do so.

$REVIEW.: Ironweed is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by William Kennedy (who also wrote the script) and has long been out-of-print, only recently debuting on DVD.Besides Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep receiving Oscar nominations for their performances in 1987, Ironweed has never been talked about much. It doesn't make any "Great Movies" lists, it's not discussed in film circles, and it's seemingly just been forgotten. This is a tragedy, because Ironweed deserves to be considered a classic.The film opens in Albany, New York in 1938, with Francis Phelan (Nicholson) asleep on a street. Francis is a bum. He hasn't shaved or showered in a while, he sleeps wherever he has to with no permanent address, and he's constantly drunk. Francis takes odd jobs when he runs out of money, sometimes with fellow bum Rudy (Tom Waits) who has six months to live ("Doctor says I got cancer. First thing I ever got."). While shoveling graves, Francis stops at the gravesite of his baby son Gerald for the first time. Gerald died when Francis dropped him. Unable to take the guilt, Francis left his wife and two other children...He's been gone 22 years. While at a soup kitchen, Francis runs into his lover Helen (Streep), also a drunk, once a singer. Frank Whaley co-stars as younger Francis.The look of the film is perfect. It does look like Depression-era New York from the costumes, to the art direction, to the cinematography. There are some subtle touches in keeping the film within its timeframe as well, such as when Helen enters a diner and on the radio there is a discussion about Orson Welles' famed "War of the Worlds" broadcast.It's very well-made, but the thing that really captured my attention was the acting...Actors tend to overact when playing drunks; Nicholson and Streep are flawless. Their performances are very subtle, low-key, and powerful. Nicholson has played some of the most beloved characters to ever grace the screen...His performance as Francis is no exception. Nicholson really taps into the psyche of his character here and, in doing so, gives one of his best performances. Streep is an actress who can seemingly play anything. Here, she is terrific. The scene where Helen sings to Francis (and the patrons) in the bar is a perfect example of how completely this woman can inhabit a role. At first I was wondering what place this scene had in the film. When the scene ends, it's rather heartbreaking.Tom Waits gives a very good performance, although I'm not sure how out of his element he is here.Besides the depth these three actors give to their characters, one of the greatest achievements in these performances are the way the actors make you fall in love with their characters.Ironweed is really a wonderful film, worthy of much more credit and praise than it ever received. It plays on your emotions the way few films can and it features two of the greatest living actors giving two of their greatest performances.A forgotten classic in every sense of the word, I doubt you'll forget it once you see it.GRADE: A

$REVIEW.: I suppose I'll write the first review now that the product has actually been released.  I consider myself a child of the 80s, although this 1980 series pre-dates my ability to remember the original airing by at least a couple of years.  However, having watched the set I recognize several of the episodes from later syndication and remember enjoying these a lot.We have here two dual-layer (no double-sided) DVDs.  The contents are divided into individual Richie Rich and Scooby Doo show segments, ranging from 7 to 12 minutes in length.  Extra short Richie Rich "Gem" segments are appended to the end of the previous cartoon and are not listed in the menu.  The cartoons from each hour episode are presented in sequential order in the menu.  There is the ever-present "Play All" option, but there doesn't appear to be a way to select and play full hour episodes.  The first cartoon from each episode has the original opening sequence, including mixed theme music and mixed animation of Richie and Scooby characters.  The last cartoon from each hour has two separate closing credits in sequence -- not sure if one or both are original.The cartoons pertaining to each hour episode are listed on the inside cover of the DVD jacket.  The Richie cartoons do not appear to have title cards, just generic "Riches", "Treasure Chest" and "Zillion-Dollar Adventures" segment titles, so the actual cartoon titles are only visible in the menu and the jacket, and where they come from is anyone's guess (syndication titles maybe?).I find the Richie Rich cartoons to be rather fun.  The character designs are improved slightly from the comic book and Richie seems a bit older.  I'm not otherwise familiar with the comic books or their stories, but the cartoon features adventures with Richie foiling crooks and solving problems, often with the help of his many wonderful gadgets and technology.  There is his robot maid Irona, who can seemingly turn into anything, and the endless assortment of gadgets and gizmos provided by Professor Keenbean.  The optimistic and unapologetic inclusion of so much gadgetry and fanciful technology is fun to watch.  The animation is as good or better than most any H-B series, although the backgrounds are a little flat and the cartoon often resembles a side-scrolling game.  However, Richie's world is bright and colorful and the action is fairly non-stop.  Gloria's voice has a few Bart Simpson moments, but otherwise usually sounds like a young girl.  I think kids today would still enjoy this cartoon immensely.Then there are the Scooby Doo segments.  Yes they have Scrappy.  While far from my favorite character, in this early entry he's not THAT bad.  I think some kind of third wheel was necessary to pull off this less (to use the term loosely) cerebral incarnation of Scooby Doo.  Scrappy Doo is the catalyst that usually gets Shaggy and Scooby into trouble, followed by lots of fearful whimpering and running scared.  The episodes are a short 7 minutes.  Villains are often real monsters with real supernatural powers.  There are no explanations, no mystery solving, no unmasking some phony in a costume.  The stories are action packed and are meant to entertain with the non-stop comic antics of Shaggy and Scooby, running around scared out of their wits and trying to escape while keeping Scrappy from getting them into even more trouble.  The short running times keep them watchable.  They certainly seem targeted toward a younger audience than earlier Scooby Doo adventures, and would likely still be entertaining to younger children.I'd say Warner Brothers did a better job on this release than some previous efforts.  If this is the quality we can expect with these slimmer 2-disc Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection sets then I'm reasonably satisfied.  Here's hoping more volumes come out with all the rest of Richie Rich and many other H-B properties still waiting in the wings.

$REVIEW.: While the first Evil Dead was good, it lacked something, and Army of Darkness (sometimes referred to as Evil Dead III) had the most money, Evil Dead II is a comfortable medium. It has the best black humor of the series and is just cheap enough to work as a lovable &quot;Hey guys let's see what we can do with what we have&quot; movie. This film will always have a special place in my heart. I saw it with my best friend at the time way back in '87 at the theater. We both loved it. Shortly after that, he ran away from home and I never saw him again.For those who love some humor with their horror, this is a perfect film. Bruce Campbell is loved by his fans, and he appreciates what he is. A B-movie actor who loves what he does. Who couldn't like a guy like that. His timing is perfect and as Ash he's a character many can relate too. I mean c'mon who else in Hollywood can play a guy with a possessed hand and beat the crap out of himself.This DVD has an outstanding behind the scenes making that is as entertaining as the film itself. It looks like so much fun, the average Joe would want to pick up his camera and make a movie with his buddies.Though the extras show the tribute to Freddy Krueger in the shed, (right above and center to the door on the inside), his glove appears in one other scene. When Ash is in the celler to get the pages, there's one shot of the door he has to open and go through. On the left Freddy's glove hangs again.ALso no one mentioned it, but when Demon Ash throws the professor's daughter against the wall and is about to kill her, he turns back into normal Ash atthe sight of his dead girlfriend's necklace. Check out the chain before he picks it up. Someone placed it in the shape of a skull.For a frightening good time with the guys, or on the couch with that special girl, you can't go wrong with Evil Dead II. As Ash would say 'Groovy'.

All of that is present in this outing but we have the added component of CGI used subtley to enhance the action. The camera work and art direction are drop dead gorgeous. The physical capabilities of the film's stars cannot be overstated. They really got down and dirty here and it was FIERCE! You can't NOT mention the music/sound, cinematography and art direction. That training sequence is BEAUTIFUL and scored for the Gods! I loved the little nods to the comics. There are frames that last fractions of a second but really create the action feel of a comic.

$review_text.: This is an unforgettable film, by great performances from Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen, Kimberly Williams, and Emilio Estevez. This timeless story is of a Vietnam veteran who has an equally difficult time adjusting to returning home as his family does. There have been many movies that depict the horror many vets and their families have had to endure. The difference, `The War at Home' is so natural and well acted that is difficult to separate fact from fiction. You believe this is the family next door. Estevez directed as well as stared in this 1996 intense drama. For those who are sensitive to the plight of the Vietnam veteran, or this subject matter, this might be to intense. It is haunting and unforgettable. Without question an excellent movie brilliantly acted.

$REVIEW.: Capturing a bit of Americana, a parcel of life foreign in nature to our own, has offered the opportunity to appreciate the diversity of living and of people in this country populated by ordinary yet extraordinary beings.  Films  that have focused on little family ventures ('Mystic Pizza'-type films) make us examine our own niche and grow to love variations on a single theme.  DIGGERS, as written by Ken Marino (who also stars), is just such a story, a window on the life of clam diggers in the shores off Long Island.  Yet as directed by Katherine Dieckmann and acted by a particularly fine cast, DIGGERS addresses the changes that occur in each of us as we progress from teenagers to adults - and all the potentially crippling and thrilling factors that can and do arise.Four friends who dig for clams as their families have done for generations interact on levels of levity and anger, support and misunderstanding, and woven through the background of these four men's lives are the women (and children) who influence them.  The apparently disparate men include wannabe photographer Hunt (Paul Rudd), procreator Lozo (Ken Marino), druggie philosopher Cons (Josh Hamilton), and womanizer Jack (Ron Eldard).  Their lives intersect on many levels: the women in their lives - Hunt's needy divorced sister Gina (Maura Tierney) who after their father's death  falls for Jack, Hunt's 'summer girlfriend' Zoey (Lauren Ambrose), and Lozo's constantly pregnant wife Julie (Sarah Paulson) - and the changes in the entire business of clamming rights as big business steps into the water.  How these characters cope with the static that jars their day-to-day existence may seem small in importance to an outsider, but by the end of the film, we 'the outsiders' have grown to know and appreciate and love this little band of fellow beings.The cast displays excellent ensemble acting and while the film has its rough edges, so does the little corner of the world described.  It is a quiet little film, all the more beautiful for being so unpretentious. Grady Harp, August 07

$REVIEW.: Britain is suffering from a severe case of "brain drain" as its top scientists keep disappearing. Sounds like a job for James Bond? Enter Harry Palmer, a spy to be sure as we watch him watching his assignment through binoculars. A ladies man to be sure, since he definitely has an eye for bird watching. Yet, the spy world of Harry Palmer is a bureaucratic labyrinth of pencil pushers, endless paperwork, and monotony. Harry is indeed a clever spy, but was recruited into the organization because of his criminal background and the threat of being sent back into prison is dangled above his head by superiors. Harry's insubordinate and a trickster but these qualities make him unpredictable and in an organization filled with straight laced bureaucrats, he's a wild card in their favor. And so Harry's transferred from one department to another as a replacement for an agent who was found shot to death, a man who was afraid of cancer, while shadowing another of the country's latest scientists. The Brits want him back and are willing to pay top dollar. Things get complicated when his old boss requests a classified file containing a section of audio tape that Harry had recovered during an investigation, identified only by the name Ipcress. Harry's perceptive enough to realize that his own spy network might contain a double agent. When he presents his case before his new department head, he's already a marked man, too hot to touch, and so is left out in the cold. THE IPCRESS FILE is the first of three films about the exploits of Harry Palmer (the other two being Funeral in Berlin (1966) and Billion Dollar Brain (1967)) and is a deliberately slow paced, stylishly directed thriller that perfectly showcases Michael Cain's subtle blend of arrogance, humor and vulnerability that he often brings to a performance. The camera work throughout is innovative, constantly peeking from behind characters, around corners, angled shots looking up from the ground, never giving us a clear perspective of what's going on. The same can be said when we see things from Harry's perspective, slightly out of focus. It is curious that he wears glasses throughout the film to see things more clearly, but it is only when his glasses are removed that he sees things how they really are. The film is complemented by an excellent score and catchy theme composed by the great John Barry. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: I ultimately enjoyed watching this film on DVD, though I have to say that I enjoyed and was frustrated by different aspects of this film in equal measures.  On the plus side, I liked the performances, the scenery, the music, and the offbeat nature of the love story (specifically, seeing two people get so taken with each other after only a few brief meetings where only a handful of words were exchanged).  I also liked the playful sense of humor peppered throughout the movie.  On the negative side, in too many cases that sense of humor appears immediately before or after moments of horrific violence, which is jarring and disruptive.  Also, I didn't like the fact that the deputies (for want of a better word) looking for Inman because he deserted his regiment are made to be really over-the-top villainous.  This turns Inman into a kind of tragic victim when they finally catch up with him.  I think the story would have been much more memorable if the deputies were simply regular, honorable people with an unpleasant task: rounding up and punishing deserters.  That would have resulted in Inman being responsible for the consequences of his actions (deserting his regiment to find the love of his life), which is much more interesting and tragic than having cartoon villains finally catch up with him, the "good" guy.  To end on a positive note, "Cold Mountain" is over two-and-a half hours long, and it held my interest throughout.  Nice image quality and a second disc of extras round out a generous and nicely-produced package.

 The DVD has done a great job in preserving its great quality
 First, the picture quality is superb


 The colors and definition are crisp
 Take a look and you'll notice great clarity in each scene


 The 5.1 sound is decent
 It doesn't employ all 5 channels of sound to the fullest extent, but it'll do for most people.Now for the special features


 Disc 1 offers great, comprehensive commentaries by the producers and the director, Robert Zemeckis


 While other directors provide useless information, this commentary is actually informative and pertinent to what's shown on screen

 Disc 2 is simply amazing

 Do you want to know how Forrest Gump was made and then some?  Disc 2 is all you need


 Considering how great the special effects were, this set of bonus features are very welcome and entertaining.If you own an the older, original copy of the Forrest Gump DVD, set it aside and get this new one


 It's worth the money


 If you don't own Forrest Gump, get it now
 Not only is the movie great but Disc 2 provides an amazing set of bonuses that other DVD's should live up to.

Why somebody actually bankrolled this movie, I'll never know. There was plenty of sex, but the most boring sex scenes imaginable.

$review_text.: Just for those thinking it's sacrilegious for Mr. Tarantino to have invented a alternative, B-movie version of WWII history, I say go fly a kite.In fact, I wish Mr. Tarantino would make several more such movies, playing fast and loose with various periods of history until we get it through our heads that doing this opens up creative avenues of insight and adventures that we currently deny ourselves.  Authors in previous ages certainly wouldn't have scrupled.But the thing seems thematically uneven to be considered great.  From what I read, Tarantino took 10 years to write this, and it shows.  They say you shouldn't take that long to write something, because there are too many changes in the author himself during such a time.  Thus what you finally come up with is likely to be stylistically and thematically clunky.  (Think of Moby-Dick:  unfortunate that the author went through so many changes while writing that.)It's like Tarantino was at times trying to do this, at other times trying to do that.  In the end we get something that doesn't cohere stylistically and is only intermittently entertaining.

$review_text.: For all the praise film-noir is lavished with (quite a lot of it valid), the majority of it relies on convention as much as the standard white-picket-fence, happy-ending 'family' film does: just invert the cliches and bathe them in deep-focus shadows. While this movie, on its surface, resembles the classic-style film noir of DOUBLE INDEMNITY, beneath the surface it's a whole different animal. No calculating evil females or tough guys masking hearts of gold populate IN A LONELY PLACE. It's a much more wrenching and powerfully disturbing film because the murder that draws the protagonists together turns out to be of peripheral importance, while the love story between Humphrey Bogart's troubled screenwriter and Gloria Grahame's B-actress spins inexorably towards damnation completely on its own power. The basic story has him a suspect in a killing, and her in love with him yet unsure of his innocence, but director Nicholas Ray stages the proceedings so that WE see it's not the murder that disturbs her but her own conviction that his self-destructive and volatile nature will destroy them both. To his credit, Ray never takes the easy way out of having Bogart turn monster on her. You care inordinately about the characters, hoping hard (as Bogart's agent does in the film) that some transforming moment will come that will spare these people and allow their deeply felt love to flourish and heal them both - even as the evidence before your own eyes tells you there ain't no way. For 1950 -hell, for any year- such an unsentimental and uncompromising treatment of a tragic adult relationship is a rarity. The shadows suffusing this excellent film come not from UFA-influenced lighting but from the Black Dahlia murder, the HUAC hearings, the death throes of old Hollywood & the moral and spiritual detachment of postwar American life. But most of all, they're projected from within the characters themselves. Grahame and Ray's own real-life deteriorating relationship formed the template for the doomed lovers, and for them, this film is an act of great courage. For his part, Bogart (the star and executive producer) takes elements of all his previous romantic loners and blends them with the harsh, sour pigments of Fred C Dobbs, running the risk of audience rejection. His performance is unflinchingly honest, among his best work ever. See this movie.

$REVIEW.: Due to his commitment with post-production on Prisoner of Azkaban, Alfonso Cuaron opted to step down as director for the fourth Harry Potter film, Goblet of Fire, allowing another director to take the reigns. Mike Newell, best known for Four Weddings and a Funeral and Donnie Brasco, became the first British director of the series. Posessing an intimate knowledge of British boarding schools (having attended one himself) allowed Newell to deliver an accurate portrayal of boarding school life. In Newell's film, the kids act like kids; they aren't afraid of shouting their feelings when they feel they've been wronged, or resorting to fistfights when they feel it's necessary. Even more so than Cuaron, Newell adds a feeling of realism to the actions of Hogwarts' student body.One thing I found interesting when comparing Prisoner of Azkaban to Goblet of Fire is that the former has a much darker tone in terms of cinematography and the overall feel of the film than the latter. This is interesting because in the previous Potter installment, our hero wasn't in any sort of real danger for the most part. We were just made to believe, like the characters in the film, that Harry was in danger throughout the entire story. Here, Harry finds himself in much more danger, his life on the line at multiple turns, but the tone is much lighter. There's also more comedy in this film, moments like Professor McGonagall teaching Gryffindor's fourth years how to dance with the help of Ron Weasley.There are less new adult parts in this film than in previous installments, but the Harry Potter franchise still attracted great actors and actresses to join the cast. Madame Maxine of Beauxbatons is played by multiple Laurence Olivier Theater Award-winner Frances de la Tour, and the amazing Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later..., Gangs of New York) portrays Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody. Goblet of Fire also attracted quality actors to play the younger parts. Among them are the then-almost-unknown Robert Pattinson (now, unfortunately, best known for his role in the Twilight series) playing the role of Cedric Diggory, Bulgarian-born Stanislov Ianevski as Viktor Krum, and Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy as Fleur Delacour. They all do an admirable job of portraying these distinct characters.Goblet of Fire is a fun film to watch, but of the movies that have come out so far I think I have the most problems with this film. I understand Newell fought the studio to keep this film as one rather than splitting it into two films, and I respect that, but there were way too many scenes that were over-dramatized. Harry's first task against the Hungarian Horntail was extended way beyond what it should have been, and Harry's venture into the lake during the second task of the Tri-wizard tournament was slightly overwrought as well. These may seem like petty arguments but these scenes took time away from other plots or subplots that could have furthered the overall story of the movie.That's not even my biggest gripe with the movie. The problem I most have with this movie is the characterizations. Michael Gambon, playing Dumbledore, never read the Harry Potter books and never felt the need to. This is very apparent in the way he attacks Potter when his name appears in the Goblet of Fire. The reaction has more in common with a regular school headmaster than a seemingly all-knowing wizard. The worst issue here, though, is the portrayal of Barty Crouch, Jr. Played by David Tennant, who would go on to play Dr. Who, we're never left to wonder about Barty's guilt or innocence as we did in the book. From the first moment we see him we have no doubt that he's a Death Eater. We also learn at the end of the movie that he's an Azkaban escapee, but no mention is made in the movie of anyone looking for him, while the last movie dealt with an Azkaban escapee that everyone in the wizarding world was looking for. This inconsistency is explained in the book, and, had they spent less time over-dramatizing certain parts of Goblet of Fire, it could have been clarified in the film as well.Goblet of Fire saw a rise in box office receipts, becoming the second-highest grossing film of the series up to this point with $895.9 million worldwide, also making it the highest grossing film of 2005. The promise of more action, more comedy, and the return of Voldemort in a fully corporeal form may have helped. While Goblet has more than its fair share of problems, its probably the most fun to watch of the films thus far, and up to this point the finale is the best of the series.

The writing and the entire cast are great. I'm not the biggest George Clooney fan, but his work in Up in the Air and The Descendants has totally made me a believer in his acting talents when given the right material. The girl who plays his oldest daughter is very good as well. One of the better movies I've seen in 2012 and worth checking out.

$review_text.: Rob Schneider isn't given the credit he deserves

Deuce Bigalow, The Animal, and now The Hot Chick are all hilarious movies, relying on witty writing and quick comedic timing to pull it off

Rob Schneider just doesn't *look* like a leading character is the problem, he actually looks like a regular guy, unlike Adam Sandler or David Spade--okay maybe they aren't exactly super-man-models, but ya get my drift? Schneider plays Deuce Bigalow, a man stuck in a rut to pay for the damages done to his friend's ruined apartment, and he is given a short time limit


So of course he turns to man-whoring, the obvious choice; however, he-whoring is not all cracked up to be, with clients ranging from an over-weight black woman with a pair of huge kazoongas, a narcoleptic, a woman with tourettes syndrome, a giant Norwegian, and a woman with a fake leg


Of all these women, he finds one who he falls in love with, and is coincidentally the only woman he does his Male Gigolo duties with--you know what I'm talking bout.It's not just a simple love comedy flick, it's quite witty in dialogue surprisingly


The characters are well portrayed, especially the Tourette Syndrome chick.Get this movie if you're looking for a good laugh, without a lot of nudity or vulgarities.

$review_text.: One year after CBS/Paramount brought us Season 1 of the highly-anticipated DVD release of "The Lucy Show" comes an equally stellar release.It's been a painfully slow wait for this one, but the end product is worth it.Originally airing during the 1963-64 TV season on Monday nights at 8:30, the second season of "The Lucy Show" stands out for a variety of firsts.Though CBS did not begin airing the show in color until 1965-66, these shows were the first Lucy escapades to be lensed in color.The restoration of these episodes is phenomenal. The colors pop right out at you, from Lucy's famous flaming red 'do, to Vivian's oversaturated blue eye-shadow, to the purple and sapphire throw cushions on their sofa. If nothing else, it's fun just to watch these again and see how vibrant the colors are.The scripts themselves are a little bit of a let-down compared to those of the stellar debut season, which was in glorious black-and-white. I always felt the writers got a little slack once Desi Arnaz stopped overseeing production on this series. (Though in my opinion, the third season saw a vast improvement in scripts).Despite a dip in the quality of the writing, the performances are still top-notch, as Lucy and Viv never disappoint and are still delivering the goods as well as they did on "I Love Lucy".Another milestone this season is the arrival of Gale Gordon as Theodore J. Mooney, the new bank president in charge of Widow Carmichael's trust fund. One of the better entries this season is a two-parter where Lucy accidentally locks Mr. Mooney in the bank vault--twice!For the next eleven years, Mr. Gordon was the only constant in both this series and its' successor, "Here's Lucy".The menus on this DVD are very cute and well-done with design, colors and fonts that evoke an early '60s/Kennedy era feel.Like the Season 1 set, viewers have the option of watching the episodes in "vintage" mode, where we get the original sponsor openings (in black-and-white as originally telecast), and some cast commercials for products such as Jello and Lux Soap. The quality of these old promos isn't as pristine as the episodes themselves, but they are in excellent condition considering their age and rarity.Some of the more interesting bonus features include a lengthy interview with Lucy "protege" Carole Cooke who, despite being in her 80s now, is still sharp as a whip and shares her stories of working with Lucy with great relish.There is also a gallery of stills from most episodes of the season, as well as several other interviews and a CBS Opening Night special from 1963.Season Two of "The Lucy Show" doesn't have as many laughs as Season 1, but is still well worth your time. Things only get better in Season 3, which I hope we won't have to wait another year to get.

$review_text.: "Alye Parusa" aka "Scarlet Sails" (1962) which is a screen adaptation of one of the most beautiful romantic, poetic, and charming books ever written "Scarlet Sails" by Alexnader Green) is one of my favorite movies since childhood. It's been many years since I saw "Scarlet Sails" but it still has the same power over me. Watching it again recently, I realized how incredibly beautiful it is, how wonderfully directed by "Walt Disney of the Soviet Union", Alexander Ptushko who had made such masterpieces as "The Stone Flower", "Sadko" (1953), "The Tale of Tsar Saltan", "Ruslan and Ludmila, "The New Gulliver", and many more. The film tells the story of a little girl named Asole, who meets a wizard one day. He tells her that sometime in the future a ship with red sails will arrive -- to take her away to a new, happy life. She holds onto this prediction in spite of taunts and the ridicule of her neighbors...Ruscico DVD is great. The film's images are fresh and joyful. The DVD includes Russian version with subtitles and dubbed to English and French versions. 16 years old Anastasiya Vertinskaya whom you may remember as Ophelia in Kozintzev's Gamlet plays Asole - it was her first role ever. Vaslily Lanovoy plays Arthur Grey , the young nobleman who dreamed of becoming a sea captain since he was a boy and who made Asole's dream come true by creating a miracle for her, the only miracle she had been waiting for all her life:"I have come to the person who is waiting only for me. I want only her, perhaps for the precise reason that thanks to her I have been able to understand one simple truth, that so-called miracles are made with one's own hands.""But there are other miracles: a smile, gladness, forgiveness, and a word which is needed and said in time. To experience them is to possess everything. As for Asole and me, we will remain forever in the glow of scarlet sails created in the depths of a heart that knows what love is..."

Scary Movie was sick, and not entirely funny.  The script, the idea, and the concept were not worth putting on film.  It may have raked in some cash, but if the movie industry is not going to care about film quality and greatness, and only about money and box office revenue, the film industry may has well stop making movies all together.  Do not see this movie if you like films that are serious and potentially could be a classic.  I would reccomend this mmovie for any fan of gross out humor.

$review_text.: "You have to have money to make money."  That's what they say, and, unless you're as determined as Chris Gardner (Will Smith), you don't have a chance.  Unfortunately, money does buy some happiness.  As Chris looks about the wealthy, he observes, "They looked so d---ed happy to me.  Why couldn't I look like that?"  His lot is to sell portable magnetic resonance imaging machines to doctors.  His prospects can be inferred by his description of them as "expensive...and only slightly better at creating images" than the ones they already had.  His wife, Linda (Chandie Newton) picks up the slack.  They have a beautiful, intelligent, inquisitive son, Christopher (Jaden Smith), whom they juggle from daycare to parent care, like many struggling wage earners.  She bears the burden as the chief wage earner, taking double shifts at the laundry, which can hardly be lucrative.  Her patience with him and the paper chase runs her ragged.  The IRS, the landlord, and the utilities all have a constant claim to their near future.  In the meantime, Chris gets an offer for the American Dream, a chance to be an intern at Dean Whitter, where, once accepted, bares a twenty-to-one chance of being hired after six months of grueling stock huckstering and hitting the books.  Like most people he wants a better life for himself and his family.  Remembering his own lot in life, he vows, "My children were gonna know who their father is."  Indeed some of the father and son scenes show real love, even by a father who is frayed by the pressures to succeed.  Taking place in the eighties, Chris will try the impossible, aligning his fortunes like the Rubik's cube he sets out to master...`The Pursuit of Happyness' pays dirt.  Every development along the way is absorbing from the first frame.  Always a stickler to detail, the beautiful background music and the well-chosen soundtrack are marvelous without ever making the film sentimental.  It's one step forward and two steps back.  This is true for Chris and the rest of us. Only the way it is revealed by Chris is truly a piece of work.  Chris tells his son, "Don't ever let anyone tell you, you can't do something...If you have a dream, you have to protect it...You want something, go get it."  Inspiring for all of us, this film may sound off themes from `Death of a Salesman,' but the results and details are often desperate, but offer us all hope.

This movie has TWO of them and still doesn't manage to create any sense of drama or danger


 The extended cut does nothing to remedy this.My hope in purchasing the extended cut was that footage featuring more character development would add to quality of the film a la the Daredevil: Director's Cut, unfortunately this was not the case.NO scenes of Blackheart and his minions posing any type of threat to the Earth or anyone else outside of a bar full of bikers.NO scenes indicating why we should care about Johnny's "Bearded Buddy" when he gets killed.And most unfortunately, NO digital replacement of Eva Mendes by ANYONE ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE!  Seriously, a monkey in a wig would have put in a better performance than she did, my goodness!The bottom line is that you don't care about anyone in the movie besides Johnny Blaze and even then it's just the basic empathy you have for any stranger who has lost a loved one.If you didn't like the first time, this version isn't going to change your mind.

$review_text.: If the mark of a tremendous comedy is the ability to leave the audience quoting its funniest lines long after the end credits roll, than "Anchorman" is one of the greatest comedic masterpieces ever produced.For a basic plot summary, "Anchorman" is set in the 1970s TV news business, where anchormen rule the roost and women are not given the time of day


 As such, legendary anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) feels threatened when female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't back down under his comic machismo."Anchorman" is a typical Will Ferrell move through and through

 That is, the humor comes from watching Ferrell recite the most hilarious of lines with the straightest of faces
 Almost every joke is completely ridiculous, but the fact that everyone plays it so straight is where the real humor arises.Also, Steve Carrell (and to a lesser extent other auxiliary cast members David Koechner & Paul Rudd, among others) nearly steals the show playing the "sidekick" role

 In one of Carrell's first film roles, he shows that his type of humor (in the same vein of Ferrell) would be around to stay
 "Brick Tamland" provides easily some of the most side-splitting material ever put to film.Overall, I consider "Anchorman" to be one of the funniest comedy films of all-time for one basic reason: it isn't a complete farce


 There are so intensely sexual, bodily secretion, or otherwise gross-out jokes in this film


 Just well thought-out and well-acted humor for the duration.

$REVIEW.: Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.From beginning to end, Barbershop piles on the jokes. Just step into this uproariously funny (and scathingly brilliant) comedy peppered with what some may consider to be politically incorrect humor. It's fresh to hear black people talking like this when most of them these days are usually leftist-leaning.My only complaint is the combining of God's Name with a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity. Why doe film-makers feel they have to put that in a movie? that's the only thing I didn't like about the film.Care for a hair cut?

$review_text.: Surprisingly, nobody here has made that joke yet, so I sort of felt obliged to.Not a bad little thriller: there's an emphasis on suspense and story development (and some unexpected turns), which is good.  Also, it's a fairly small number of people who actually get "whacked" --and even fewer get the full-on wax treatment, which is sort of surprising, given the title, --and sort of a relief, when you consider how cruel this movie is in its minute details.The really disappointing thing is that the movie never really succeeds in getting under your skin the way that GREAT horror movies do, because it never smartly addresses the odd, psycho-sexual reasons for THIS PARTICULAR kind of murder and mayhem.  There's a lot of standard-issue "slasher"-style hunting and killing (sorry, but that comes under a totally different 'psycho' category -- read your textbooks, people!)  Why a house of wax?, except that it's already been done before, so the filmmakers can play it safe with a ready-made title?  I mean, it's *always* creepy to get stalked and killed by a masked, limping nutcase -- but what is it about the whole 'preserved-in-wax' thing that is creepy in the particulars?  The movie never gives a good explanation, so you keep thinking, 'what was THAT all about?'.There's lots of better scary movies out there, and there's lots worse... I just wish they'd take a little more time to discover that there's different ways to be afraid, and different reasons for it.Plus, what is with all these reviewers chortling over the death of Paris Hilton?  Yeah, maybe you don't like her, but that's kind of a tasteless sentiment to indulge.  Grow a bit of humanity, folks!

$REVIEW.: Well the movie hostel is back with a sequel


With a surprisingly good reaction from the first one hey decided to make a second one

I must say while the first one was better than the second the second one was not that far off


In fact I felt they set this movie up perfect with following up with the first one
The one guy that was able to escape the chamber has been alive for awhile but has been paranoid that people were coming to kill him from the chamber

Sure enough when his wife woke up the next morning his head was cut off


It had a similar storyline from the first one but it was not as exciting


There were a lot of brutal killing scenes that added to the movie and I must warn you ahead of time that if you don't have a strong stomach that you should not watch this movie because it can be hard to watch at times
Ultimately a good movie and I will give it 3.5/5 stars.

$REVIEW.: How can a film by a major studio containing such an array of first class actors be a bomb?  Well, it happened here...in spades.  It must be that the cast and crew wanted a holiday in Spain and so agreed to be in this ridiculous Agatha Christie story.  The acting is almost tongue in cheek; you can't believe, for example, how awful Roddy McDowall can be as a gay and how ridiculous Diana Rigg is as the bitchy victim.  (The costumes, all around, are grotesque, especially on Rigg and Maggie Smith.)  If we hadn't seen David Suchet in the role of Poirot, we might have given a pass to Peter Ustinov.  But alas, he is a parody of the character we all know and love.  The pair of actors playing the villains have skills akin to what one might see in a high school play.  James Mason, 73, is barely in the film but gets star billing.  His crude hair dye is somehow appropriate.Good photography is all this stinker has going for it.  I hope the participants had a good time on location.  For the rest of us, the final product is only yet another occasion to groan aloud.Oh yes, where was the villain's stolen jewel?  In his unlit pipe, as Poirot expected all along.  Argggggggggg.

$review_text.: Its a good flick for someone who wants to see a scary movie but doesn't have the stomach for something suspense driven like Hitchcock or even the early "Nightmare on Elm Street" or who can't stand the gore of a "Saw." The premise is not new: some contagion makes people into violent, insane killing machines. The director goes to great lengths to separate his movie from the rash of recent zombie movies, but really, that makes no difference. We've seen this all before.There are a few good moments such as a simultaneous choke/stabbing and a car wash that had to go wrong, but most of the scenes take too long to develop and, once again, there is a completely ineffective and illogical military response to an outbreak. "Crazies" doesn't even give lip service to an explanation for why the virus behaves how it does or how it gets out of control. The military forces are simultaneously ruthless and fatally unconcerned with containment to a point beyond willing suspension of disbelief. This movie is mind candy for the squeamish.

$REVIEW.: For any nay-sayers who say an older movie can't deserve to be on the AFI top 100 listing, I point a strong finger at Mutiny on the Bounty with Clark Gable. Released in 1935, the acting is just as powerful as a modern movie. Yes, the special effects might not be as stellar, but it's the acting that carries this true-life story through its twists and turns.Yes, there really was a ship named the Bounty, and on April 28, 1789, there really was a well documented mutiny. Ship's logs, the captain's diary, and other records indicate what happened when Fletcher Christian led his crew against the overbearing Captain William Bligh. It is amazing the level of detail we know about who was involved, where the ship went, and what the day by day results were from an event over two hundred years in the past.When Laughton and Gable sought to re-create this event, there were definitely liberties taken. If you compare the official records against this one, there are many gaps. So it's important to know up front that this is not a documentary. Instead, this is a dramatic retelling. If it intrigues you enough, you can then go online to find out what really happened and where all of the various characters ended up.So that being said, the actors in this 1935 version get the highest kudos for their acting. They could easily have all blended together into "random pile of sailors on a small boat". Instead, we get a strong sense of their backgrounds and movitations. Bligh isn't just a bully. He's an incredibly capable sailor who has had to claw his way to the top past men who looked down on him for his birth. Christian doesn't just flip on Bligh at the first grumpy action. He stays with it, defending his Captain, his sense of honor being eroded away with each passing day until he just can't take it any more.Yes, we have the nearly-naked Tahitian girls who instantly fall in love with any white man who crosses their path - quite a difference from what happened in real life. And yes, the ending doesn't quite match up with reality. But again, we have to look at this in terms of the story it is choosing to tell. That story grabs a hold of us, draws us in, and makes us eager to find out what happens next.Highly recommended, as a showing of just how well done and powerful an "older movie" can be.I acquired this movie with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.

$REVIEW.: This might rate as the most entertaining of all the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes films, which I still think are the best renditions on film of the famous detective.This has a surprising amount of action and is simply a fun story to watch. Packed into just one hour are such scenes as Holmes faking his death, a near-poisoning of he and Dr. Watson by gas, a strange little boy who hops around a room, tarantulas on the loose, on and on.Nigel Bruce is his normally funny Dr. Watson and Gale Sondergaard makes an excellent villain. Credibility is stretched in the beginning and ending scenes but it's an enjoyable ride all the way through.This DVD looks super, too. What a great "restoration" job was done on this.

$REVIEW.: It is the 1850s in a rocky New England farm that is home to the despotic owner, Ephraim Cabot (Burl Ives) and his resentful son Eben (Anthony Perkins).  At 25, Eben is only staying on the farm because he expects to inherit the land, even though his greedy and cruel father swears that will never happen.  The old man goes off and marries Anna (Sophia Loren), a seductive woman of Eben's age.  She is repulsed by her husband, but desperately wants the farm, so there is immediate friction between Anna and her new stepson.  Hatred soon turns to lust, however, and the two make good use of the hay loft.  Anna gives birth to a son and Ephraim declares that the farm will be his alone one day, a decision that leads to a shocking act.Eugene O'Neill's classic tragedy makes just an OK transition to the screen, despite the talented cast, literate script, and dramatic score by Elmer Bernstein.  Something is missing; one never feels any passion or joy or urgency between Eben and Anna; in fact, they both seem to sleepwalk through the story, reciting their lines when it's their turn and glowering throughout.  The one who really shines is Burl Ives; he is totally convincing as the hateful, Bible-quoting father and his robust and gleefully evil performance is reason enough to watch the movie.  A big problem was the farm; it was the sole location and the object of everyone's desire, and yet the scenes were obviously filmed indoors, giving it a false, stagey look.  The pervasive mood is of unremitting gloom, and since none of the characters is likeable or heroic, one is left feeling empty, wishing there had been more of an emotional connection between them and with us.

$REVIEW.: WOw, this is a funny and outdated movie that purports to be archaeologically accurate

 My daughter and I watched with a constant stream of laughter, she being a serious student of archaeology.A band of tough women - all clean cut and covered above and below - have decided they need to claim mates


 They were separated off from another tribe when very young, due to the bad treatment their mothers received as women slaves
 Now these women will knock out some boys and take them on their terms


 Once the boys are taken captive, they discover fire and claim dominance in their turn

 Then, in a mutual fight against an evil giant, they truly bond and found their own tribe.Not only is the story preposterous, but the acting is not all that great and the science is rather questionable
 That being said, we did enjoy it, granted more as an object of ridicule than a film experience.Not recommended unless you can get a free copy.

$REVIEW.: "Five Easy Pieces" is about a man who never got what he wanted. A guy who is trapped between two worlds and he can not find happiness in either. Of course we can feel for him. What bothers me is that he is so unrelentingly abusive, and he believes he is absolutely entitled to his behavior because things did not work out the way he planned. On the whole, "Five Easy Pieces" is a very good film, and Nicholson's performances is flawless, but I can't help but think the film would have been a little bit better had we gotten the man's softer side. No, I am not looking for some forced fluffy scenes to make him more sympathetic, not exactly. Rather, I want to see it so that I can recognize some basic decency in him.

$review_text.: Evidently Smith, who shot the acclaimed movie Clerks on roughly the same amount of money I make in a year and had it blow the roof off everything, recently went on a speaking tour of several American colleges and universities for protracted Q&A; sessions.  If you're profoundly enamored of Smith's movies, this selection of the best questions will probably be right up your street.  If you're even entertained by the movies, as I am, you'll probably see enough to hold your interest, and there are some interesting nuggets regarding filmmaking and filmmakers that will have broad audience appeal.However, for all but the most dedicated fans, what you're looking at here frequently descends into a lengthy parade of penis and fart jokes, trivial personal anecdotes, and rambling stories that only the most dedicated fans will be able to keep up with for any length of time.I'm sure the story of the first time he made love to his wife is profoundly interesting to Smith and his fans.  Ditto the story of his brief personal feud with Tim Burton or how Jason Mewes came up with his catch lines like "Snoogens."  But I'm an adult now, and calibrating penis stories or investigating the etymology of a baby-talk word just goes right past me like a shot.Dedicated View Askew fans will probably find more than enough material in this to keep them coming back.  I find an adolescent appeal to the worst juvenalia that keeps cropping up on college campuses.  I should have saved those three hours out of my life for something more constructive.

$REVIEW.: The Walking Dead is to zombie movies what The Sopranos was to gangster movies:  a chance to expand the genre into something new and more detailed.  Your standard zombie flick pits a few people against an army of zombies and offers plenty of gory violence.  The Walking Dead does the same thing, but has an emphasis on plot and character that most zombie films don't.  This isn't to denigrate the movies, but you can do a lot more with a story if you have five hours (in the first season) than only 90 minutes.The Walking Dead's principal protagonist is deputy Rick Grimes who (in shades of 28 Days Later) wakes up from a gunshot-induced semi-coma to find the world is a much grimmer place.  Most of civilization has fallen due to a zombie epidemic (actually, in the show, "zombie" is not used; the preferred term is "walker").  Fortunately, they are the "classic" slow moving zombies; unfortunately, there are millions of them.The early part of the six-episode season focuses on Grimes's attempts to find his family.  It's not much of a spoiler to indicate his wife and son are alive (it's revealed early on) and eventually he will join them and a group of other survivors.Grimes's role as an authority figure puts him in a leadership position (taking it over from his cop partner, who had the role first).  It is an inherently unstable position since the law doesn't really exist anymore.  For Grimes, there is also the struggle to maintain his natural integrity.  At one point, he will risk his life (and others') to attempt to rescue a nasty drug-addled racist.  Later, he will drive a decision for the group to leave their camp and seek refuge at a different place, a location that will seem safer but also bears a terrible secret.Since you are with these characters for a longer period of time than in a movie, they wind up involving you more, which heightens the suspense.  This is one of the goriest TV series to ever appear on a non-premium channel, but it works in its context.  It won't appeal to a lot of people for this reason, but for those who like zombie stories, this is superb entertainment.

$REVIEW.: I just finished the second season of this series, which I did not catch while it was in first runs on TV.  The snappy dialogue and quirky characters continue to amuse and surprise as we watch Lorelai and Chris almost get back together.  Rory becomes more of a friend to Paris but less of a girlfriend to poor Dean in favor of tough guy Jess, Sookie and Jackson finally hook up, Luke remains Lor's best pal, and Taylor Doose still drives everybody crazy while Kirk is...well, oddball Kirk.  And then there's that minstrel.  And Rory's funny friend Lane, whom I feel sorry for because of her too-strict mother.Anticipating the third season.

$review_text.: At first glance, I thought the movie was about a woman Marine

 I thought "How cool!" since I'm a female vet
 Watching the story unfold in this movie, I was awe-struck at how well this was done

 This is a really great, great story
 And probably as real as it gets!  I am impressed at the actors

 The military scenes had me do a de ja vue

 I hated the military since I was released with "behavior unsuitable for the military", meaning I was lesbian

 What was unsuitable was the way I was treated as a human being.Regardless of my past, this movie is spiracular

 A definate MUST SEE.

$REVIEW.: Boris Karloff plays James Lee Wong, a Chinese private detective
Little is done to convince you he is Chinese apart from the name
He doesn't look the part and Karloff doesn't hide his English accent
The plot of the film begins with a businessman coming to Wong for help
He feels he is in danger but can't explain why or from whom
Wong doesn't get a chance to start investigating before the man drops dead in his office the next day

His business partners are obvious suspects as they have all just signed a document giving ownership to the other two if one dies

There is another suspect, Carl Roemer, who has developed a formula that he believes the dead man stole from him

Just before the man died, Roemer had threatened him with a gun.The police investigate working with Wong which is good because the police in this movie were as dumb as bricks


The other business partners die one by one which leaves Roemer as the only viable suspect but it takes Wong to figure out the clever way he killed them when they always died alone, locked in a room.This movie is another one of those enjoyable to watch but nothing spectacular movies


The plot is just interesting enough to make you want to see how it all turns out.

$SUMMARY.: Just interesting enough to keep watching

$REVIEW.: What sold me on this package is that the season 1 episodes are full length; not the uncut syndicated releases that dogged the standalone set.What is great about this show is its family-friendly nature.  It appeals to everybody.  In ways it redefined television, but at the same time, no TV show since then has had the cleanliness Cosby had put into his show.Of course, everybody knows all that -- what I should do is talk about the DVD release.Sound and video quality are very good, even at 9 episodes jammed onto every disc.  The master tapes digitally remastered -- this will look and sound perfect once it's put onto blu-ray.It's got a fair share of extras to discuss the one thing about the 1980s worth remembering (apart from Devo, oddly) and even a full color booklet with a reproduction of the pilot episode's script.  Which is nice, but......why not spare us the book and give some decent disc inserts?  The set is divvied up into 4 smaller booklets within the main package.  Seasons 1&2, season 3&4, 5&6, 7&8.  Each booklet has cardboard inserts that will readily scratch the disc -- BE CAREFUL WHEN HANDLING or go out and buy separate sleeves for the discs.  It is not really being green-friendly to replace solid plastic cases with cardboard ones that, after repeated viewing, make the disc unplayable and compelling to customer to buy another set, only to scratch the new discs all over again.Season 1 sells the set.  But add another $5 in additional disc sleeves.  Even when taking mine out I saw minute scratches.  They will add up quickly and spare you hassle in the long-term.
$review_summary.: The last great family-friendly sitcom... in a case that will make you spit family-unfriendly words.

$REVIEW.: I rented this movie the first time i saw it and i was so impressed with both Abbie Cornish and Heath Ledger

they both prove in this film that they have the ability to do all types of roles

the story is moving but sad and when the movie is over you cant help feeling a little bit depressed


But its a story of love between two people and a drug that completely transforms their lives and themselves as people


If your a movie buff or your just interested in seeing a good movie with great acting, i would suggest it very much
and if your a Heath Ledger fan i would definitely add this to your list of his movies

we should take advantage of the movies he did make since he's gone now

and he gave a great performance in this one!!

$REVIEW.: Bear with me.A young girl is encouraged by her widower father to explore the world and beyond; soon left orphaned, she turns inward and relentlessly pursues the signs for intelligent life in the universe, only  to be thwarted at every turn by an evil nemesis and yet be assisted by a  mysterious shadowy figure with the power to make his machinations stick.  Add to this a love story between our driven scientist and a fallen yet  equally driven spiritualist and you have all the making of a mass of hokum  that in lesser hands would go downhill faster than a Radio Flyer on Mount  Everest.However, we are in the hands of Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump,  Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Back To The Future) who masterfully weaves the  framework drafted by Carl Sagan into a marvelous tapestry.Jodie Foster  is Ellie Arroway, the driven scientist who needs empirical evidence for  anything to exist in her world.  She's part of a SETI (Search for  Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) group about to have their funding pulled by  Dr. David Drumland (Tom Skeritt), who at the film's open is the director of  the National Science Foundation.  Arroway's childhood traumas and  fascinations have fused to turn her into this driven force; she is a woman  with a vision and she is not easily deterred.  Ellie briefly becomes  involved with Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), a man who nearly became a  priest, but who admits that celebacy was a problem for him, which makes him  no less devout as a messenger for God's word.What evolves is a story  that explores the relationship between society, science, and religion.  Its  characters, which could easily fall cartoonish in the wrong hands, are  well-drawn and expertly directed by Zemeckis, who had some prior experience  with 'toons and apparently was aware what to watch out for.Lest you  think my opening was a criticism of Carl Sagan and Ann Dryan's screen  story, it was not.  Sagan and Dryan provided a good story structure for  screenwriters James Hart and Michael Goldenberg to build on.  Zemeckis,  aided by Alan Silvestri's music, keeps it all in tune and doesn't provide  us with pat answers, and yet keeps us interested.One of the more  endearing qualities of this film is its true-to-life representation of what  would happen in America should what happens to Ellie happens to us.  From  beginning to end, every part of her experience rang true.So, for a  thoughtful way to spend 2 hours, rent or purchase this film.  You'll enjoy  it.

$review_text.: NOTE: I updated this review in 2013.No matter what you call him, he's exactly what his one time theme music & DVD title says in that he was one of a kind as far as his athletic skill, presence in the ring, innovative offense, and overall in-ring ability resulting in many singles & tag team title reigns including World Championships & a history making reign as a World Television Champion...that man is (point your thumbs at yourself) Rob Van Dam.  Now the DVD set is in the format of a match anthology from his career in WCW & ECW & ECW which hosted by Josh Mathews with Rob Van Dam having comments on various subjects with video clips in between each match on various subjects such as WCW, his ECW debut, relationship with Sabu, story behind the names "Mr. Monday Night" & "The Whole F'n Show", his record setting Van Dam Lift, the importance of the ECW Television Championship, injuries, his various finishing moves, WWE Hardcore Championship, and the difference between wrestling in WWE compared to ECW.Matches Include:Robbie V vs. Scotty Flamingo - This short match last a little over 3 minutes just showing Rob in his early days wrestling barefoot while showcasing such offense that is typical of him & others today but rarely seen during that time such as his martial arts kicks, backflip, springboard crossbody, and split legged moonsault.  The bigger story behind this match though happens around 3 years later when these men would become big name attractions in ECW with Robbie V becoming Rob Van Dam & Flamingo being known as Raven."WCW Worldwide" Feb. 93vs. Axl Rotten - This was RVD's ECW debut match that saw him showcasing his unique style early on with such offense as the split legged dropdown, japanese armdrag, and springboard crossbody while using martial arts strikes while Rotten resulted in his trademark formula of brawling while doing some impactful holds like the t-bone suplex & a clothesline that turned RVD inside out while also mocking his martial arts before RVD recovered showing his cat-like ability & aeral offense with various holds such as the top rope somersault, top rope side kick, and split legged moonsault.  The match itself isn't anything special but it was a showcase for Rob Van Dam to make a positive first impression on the ECW fans which he did."ECW Hardcore TV" Jan. 96vs. Sabu - Sabu was wearing a neck brace which he tossed aside right before the match while RVD had an injured leg which Sabu attempted to go after right away before the top rope broke in the opening minutes but didn't stop Sabu as he still did his moves such as the the triple jump moonsault & suicide dive onto RVD on a guardrail.  The match went into the crowd with both men throwing chairs at each other with RVD being able to execute a legdrop using a chair as they made their way back into the ring with both men using the chair throughout the match for more impactful offense such as RVD money flipped out of the corner onto an open chair & one of the very first Van Daminators while both men showcased very similar offense with Sabu's top rope flip legdrop & RVD's top rope flip dive.  Both men turned out the intensity with such hard hitting offense such as a double jump dive into the crowd, a DDT through a table, coming off the top rope catching the other man in a DDT on the way down, a brainbuster superplex, and the atomic arabian facebuster from the top rope resulting in a match that was just so physical that both men had to be taken to the back on a stretcher.On a personal note, this was the very first ECW match I ever saw & had me hooked ever since.Alternative commentary on this match by RVD & Paul Heyman include the story behind the broken ring in this event resulting in the infamous dance by Kimona, RVD's history with Sabu, the ECW audience, his work ethic, and moves he's glad he doesn't do anymore because they're too dangerous.ECW Hardcore Heaven 96w/Sabu vs ECW Tag Team Champions Eliminators - Both teams were so evenly matched from the start that they kept trading momentum performing the same offense on each other using quick tags & double teaming while performing stereo moves like splashes & leg lariats.  Sabu & RVD were able to maintain control with their double team offense such at the low dropkick & camel clutch, surfboard & top rope elbow before the brawl went to the outside with Sabu diving into crowd while Eliminators made a comeback with back to back top rope splashes, various combination of kicks, and even preventing Sabu from doing his daredevil attack by kicking the legs from under him.  This was a quality tag team match as both teams were very evenly matches & similar to each other with the addition of tables & ladders & chairs adding another element to the match years before we would ever hear of a T.L.C. match.ECW Crossing The Line 97vs. Lance Storm - This was originally suppose to be Chris Candido vs. Lance Storm but RVD replaced Candido after he suffered an injury with Storm always remaining one step ahead in the early exchanges before RVD was finally able to catch him before both men had an aerial attack with holds like the leaping somersault dive, top rope back elbow, and moonsault press on the outside.  RVD got more aggressive to the point where he brought a chair into play & threw it in Storm's face quick like a bullet followed by the running chair dropkick in the corner & frog splash but Storm kept fighting back catching him in submissions like the boston crab into a single crab before using the chair himself for holds like a Tiger Bomb & top rope legdrop onto the open chair.  This was a solid match & they would go on to have better quality matches as Storm still wasn't comfortable with the ECW environment yet (as you could tell by the chairshots he gave) but this was more about the infamous speech afterwords where RVD addressed the crowds chants of "You Sold Out!"ECW Barely Legal 97vs. Jeff Hardy - This was just a quick dominate squash match with RVD using his trademark holds like the somersault dive, split legged moonsault & 5 Star Frog Splash but mainly noteworthy for him getting his nickname of "Mr. Monday Night" from Jerry Lawler."RAW" May 97Flag Match vs. Tommy Dreamer - This wasn't the type of flag match where you had to get your flag off a pole to win the match but just a regular match where the winner was able to raise his company's flag (WWE for RVD & ECW for Dreamer) while it made clear before the match that Dreamer was wrestling with a broken heel to the point where he had to wear a medical boot to compete.  RVD went right after Dreamer's foot & worked over it quickly as the match went into the floor where RVD was able to pull off a springboard somersault off the guardrail before Dreamer was able to catch RVD with a chairshot giving Dreamer an advantage before Bill Alfonzo got involved.  RVD someone was cut over his eye but continued to bring the offense using a chair with such holds like a springboard side kick or top rope backflip into low dropkick in the corner but Dreamer made a comeback giving a receipt for the dropkick & used the chair to block RVD's attempt at his split legged moonsault before catching RVD in the middle of his offense again countering it into a drop DDT from the top, hitting his own Van Daminator, and a piledriver that had RVD's body bounce inches off the mat.  This was a good back & forth match that had everyone getting involved from the wrestlers to the managers & referees to outside associates with a few surprise appearances with the only thing negative here is that the a part of the match was edited for some unknown reason.ECW November 2 Remember 97vs. ECW Television Champion Bam Bam Bigelow - Sabu was already scheduled to face Bigelow for the TV Title at the upcoming PPV so Bill Alfonzo set it up for RVD to face Bigelow in order to soften up Bigelow for the match with Bigelow having a bandage above his eye from a previous match against Sandman.  Bigelow kept catching RVD whenever he went for his offense like a regular kick or frankensteiner & powered him down before working him over with moves like headbutts but RVD continued to try to use the "hit & run" offense as he took to the air coming off the top rope with sidekicks & crossbody before the match got taken into the crowd where he took Bigelow down with a frankensteiner off the guardrail & went off the top rope into the crowd onto Bigelow twice.  They made their way back to ringside where Bigelow continued to bring the power to RVD as he powerbombed him onto a ringside table that didn't give causing Bigelow to come off the apron with an elbow through RVD & the table before making their way into the ring where RVD went after that Bigelow's cut over his eye with various kicks as Sabu appeared going after the eye as well but accidentally assisted in history being made in the process.  The match itself was definitely "power vs. agility" as Bigelow was a powerful beast causing RVD to take many high risk moves to the point where some of them remained on the opening video of the TV show for a long time afterwords with the result being the start of a historic reign that definitely made RVD a main event attraction."ECW Hardcore TV" Apr. 98[ECW: Path Of Destruction]ECW Television Championship Match vs. Jerry Lynn - Both men were so evenly matched early on that they had a stalemate before Lynn got the first major hit in after RVD mocked him with a clothesline that sent RVD to the outside followed by catching him with a cannonball off the apron & baseball slide sending RVD into the crowd as Lynn followed him with a springboard crossbody.  RVD came back with his trademark spinning legdrop off on the outside onto Lynn as the match went back into the ring where he brought a chair into the match catching Lynn in a surfboard only to launch him in the air landing on the chair before Lynn countered an attempt at a monkeyflip into a powerbomb onto the chair followed by a reverse DDT & countering the Van Daminator into a legdrop with both holds causing a landing directly on the chair as both men would eventually fight for the chair on the top rope with RVD taking two chairshots & coming back with a Van Daminator that caused Lynn to fall through a table.  This was a very athletic & physical contest that was the "breakout" match for Jerry Lynn as he earned the nickname "The New F'n Show" after this match.ECW Living Dangerously 99vs. Jerry Lynn - This match was a completely different setup than a majority their previous matches in ECW as this one wasn't for a championship, Lynn wasn't a fan favorite at this point in his career & had Cyrus in his corner, and RVD was returning after a long absence without Bill Alfonzo in his corner.  The early exchanges between both men sent them into a stalemate before going over the top to the outside with RVD having his mouth bleeding from going into the guardrails but being able to recover with a moonsault press off the guardrail followed by his trademark corkscrew legdrop onto Lynn on the guardrail.  Both men traded momentum with RVD delivering a backflip splash then second rope moonsault splash, Lynn doing a hard clothesline to RVD's bleeding mouth, RVD's running chair dropkick in the corner, and Lynn catching RVD on top rope with powerbomb onto chair followed by a DDT onto the chair.  This wasn't a classic as their previous battles over the television title but still a high quality encounter that saw both Cyrus & his nemesis getting involved but it mostly remembered as the final original ECW match that a majority of people saw.ECW Guilty As Charged 01vs. WWE Hardcore Champion Jeff Hardy - "The more things change, the more they stay the same" as RVD is once again wrestling in the WWE as a member of ECW against Jeff Hardy just like how he did 4 years earlier except ECW at this time was part of the invasion faction called "The Alliance" with WCW while Jeff Hardy was no longer that no-named jobber but established as one half of the Hardy Boyz tag team holding multiple tag team & singles titles in WWE.  Both men traded momentum early on with both men having a stalemate, RVD able to hit rolling thunder, Hardy pushing RVD off the top rope onto the barricade, and Hardy running the barricade for a clothesline only for RVD to catch him with one of his own.  The took the match into the crowd before making it back to ringside with RVD being able to execute his trademark moonsault & corkscrew legdrop while Hardy was able to comeback with a sunset flip to the outside that resulted in RVD being powerbombed off the apron onto the floor as Hardy pulled out a ladder only to be shoved off the top of it onto the ramp.  Hardy introduced a chair with various chairshots to RVD before RVD responded with his Van Daminator that ended up knocking Hardy off the top of the ramp to the floor causing Hardy to be cut above the forehead before the match made it's way back to ring with both men being able to avoid & counter each others signature moves like the split legged moonsault & swanton bomb while hitting their own impactful moves like a DDT & 5 Star Frog Splash.  This was the match you would expect from these two as they both have offense that's almost similar in that they almost come off as daredevils with the amount of high risk moves to not only deliver but take as well.Invasion 01vs. Chris Jericho - This was the semi-finals of the King Of The Ring tournament that year as both men same out with the same idea exchanging armdrags & a dropkick at the same time resulting in a stalemate before RVD finally got an advantage with his educated feet & going areal with his somersault dive over the top rope & side kick off the top rope causing Jericho to use dirty tactics to gain advantage with a double arm superplex followed by grounding RVD while still breaking the rules whenever possible such as choking using the ropes & wrist tape as they continued to battle back & forth with various counters & reversals throughout the rest of the match.  This was an average encounter as they seemed to be off at times as their match from the previous Unforgiven PPV was a better quality encounter.King Of The Ring 02Ladder Match vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Christian - Christian was in control early before RVD was able to regain momentum with his baseball slide into a ladder & somersault over the ropes onto Christian & the ladder followed by his spinning kick onto Christian laying on the ladder. Christian gave a hard irish whip onto RVD into the ladder in the corner before RVD countered showing some strength of his own by pressing Christian onto the ladder followed by a backwards flip. Hard hits were taken by both men such as Christian being monkeyflipped into a ladder, RVD landing on a ladder after missing the frog splash, and Christian falling & hitting a ladder face first.  With both men being ladder match experts, you got what you expected from a one on one ladder match as there was plenty of hard hits & using the ladder to make moves more impactful."RAW" Sept. 03[Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn](Bonus) Robbie E vs. Pat Rose - This was RVD's WCW debut in a "Underdog Challenge" where two unknown names have a match to get noticed by the WCW officials (similar to the current concept of TNA's Gut Check) as this was mostly just an early display of RVD's unique style that was unseen in WCW during that time with his mix of martial arts kicks, athleticism using moves like the crossbody & split legged moonsault, and basic wrestling ability such as an armbar."WCW Saturday Night" Jan. 93(Bonus) vs. Sabu - Both men were coming into this match with injures to the point where RVD had a cast on his wrist while Sabu intimidated the ring announcer to make the match with no time limit.  Sabu went after RVD & keeping him grounded with various submissions while attacking RVD's knee before dropkicking RVD off the top rope to the floor & into the crowd where RVD kept getting hit with chairs followed by his triple jump moonsault into the crowd but RVD was finally able to start mounting some offense when he cannonballed himself with a chair onto Sabu on the floor followed by a running hilo over the top to the floor & shoving Sabu off the top through a table.  RVD targeted Sabu's neck heavily with moves like the german suplex, top rope neckbreaker that would in the future be known as the Buff Blockbuster & giotine legdrop but Sabu was still somehow able to put RVD through a table with a flip legdrop & punish RVD with a hanging spike DDT & triple jump moonsault.  Nobody was able to physically bring this much of a fight to Sabu before RVD & this was the beginning of the series that would put him on the map in ECW with the aftermath that ensured this rivalry would continue.ECW Hostile City Showdown 96(Bonus) ECW Television Championship Match vs. Balls Mahoney - RVD was originally suppose to defend the title against european wrestler Johnny Smith but he was taken out & replaced with Balls in the main event position of this PPV. Balls started out in control being very physical with his brawling to the point where they went to the outside & in the crowd twice as RVD got some offense in with an early Van Daminator in the crowd & top rope hilo into the crowd before Balls resorted to not only his superior power with holds like a powerbomb & powerslam but also going aerial himself with a legdrop & frog splash himself off the ropes.  A chair was brought into play as RVD used it for a more impactful dropkick & rolling thunder while Balls caught a monkeyflip attempt into a powerbomb on the chair followed by a spike DDT & chairshot that just absolutely knocked RVD out.  This turned out to be a much better match than expected as RVD was able to bring out more from his opposition than they normally would against anyone else during this period as Balls Mahoney had the reputation of just being a "hardcore chair swinging freak" but actually showcased athleticism as well.Alternative commentary with RVD & Paul Heyman talked about the history behind this PPV event, the importance of being the Television Champion, addressing the label of ECW being a "bingo hall promotion", Bill Alfonzo, Balls Mahoney's underrated ability, and how RVD was a different type of champion defending against both faces & heels.ECW Anarchy Rulz 99Other DVD extras include two vignettes on RVD, a look behind the scenes of the music video for his "One Of A Kind" theme song by Breaking Point, a video feature on RVD filmed at the Invasion PPV, his profile from "Before They Were Superstars", talking about his WrestleMania moments, various "Confidental" stories on the airbrush artist who does his singlets & comparing his frog splash to Eddie Guerrero's & a tour of the Jakks Pacific office & a look at a fantasy match against Jimmy Snuka & answering 10 questions on 'Outside The Ropes', and two hidden ECW promos.While I question some of the match choices (the Jericho match & editing the Dreamer match), the match quality overall was no different than his frog splash in that it's 5 stars that I recommend to anyone who's a fan of Rob Van Dam, ECW, or just good quality action.

$review_text.: The themes of masculinity, and disallusioned youth seeking justice are great themes.  I applaud the makers for taking it on.  But what it lacks is something key to entertainment: an interesting story.  It comes off as a mere social commentary in which Thatcher's 80s are subtley compared to the present.  There was good acting, especially by the protagonist.  But there was no real solution or direction given and therefore left one feeling a bit hopeless at the end.

$REVIEW.: "The Reaping" is supposed to be this year's entry into the horror/thriller/lost faith genre, but doesn't quite know where to go. Should it be just a horror flick? No. How about a "lost faith" story? Nope. But it does qualify for being a thriller, in my opinion. The Reaping is as formulaic as it may be; it's still fun to watch. Hilary Swank finally looks feminine despite portraying yet another fearless female. She plays Katherine Winter, an ex-woman of the cloth who turned her back on the Church after suffering personal tragedy, and now spends her time as a professor debunking miracles as myths.But she runs out of plausible explanations when what appears to be the Bible's Ten Plagues begin to afflict a small town and she is called there to help its citizens. They blame a young girl, Loren McConnell (played frighteningly well by AnnaSophia Robb), whom they accuse of having killed her brother in a river that has now turned into blood, the first plague. Katherine encounters her several times and has trouble getting into an objective frame of mind as she likens Loren, no matter how creepy looking she is, to her own daughter.During the time I was watching this I notice that some of the plagues could have used a scarier execution. Like, when the frogs fell out of the sky, they were only a few, and oddly, none fell on the characters, just around them. That would have been a perfect eww-gross opportunity. Also, with the frequent references to the eerie wind chimes that everyone in the town seemed to have, I kept expecting to see some connection in the end but it was unsatisfying a mere misdirection. Hilary Swank is a phenomenal actress, there is no question, and she deserves far greater than her role as Katherine Winter gives her to work with. David Morrissey, as Doug, is as bland as he was in 2006'sBasic Instinct 2 (Unrated, Extended Cut)And coming off of her wonderful recent performance inBridge to Terabithia (Widescreen Edition)Annasophia Robb has nothing at all to do but squint her eyes and look suspicious. The amount of dialogue she is given could be recited in full in the span of thirty seconds. It's a haphazard gimmick of a part that no child actor should be cursed with having to portray.Like Louisiana needed more problems after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, it gets ten Biblical plagues in The Reaping, a great-looking thriller that's all beauty and no brains. Director Stephen Hopkins, who's done some good work on television but mostly bad work in features, starts early and keeps the shocks coming thick and fast. The trouble is, they're all tricks of editing and sound effects - nothing shocking actually happens. The obvious intent is to unnerve viewers and keep them on edge, but it will have the opposite effect on some, building up their immunity instead. Katherine's scientific explanation of the plagues in Exodus, whether you believe it or not, is the highlight of this movie. Everything else is just for effect, and enough of it is effective that The Reaping reaps a sow-sow rating. Nevertheless, watch "The Reaping" if you want to pass the time; if anything, it will keep your mind off your present life.

$REVIEW.: Now changing tack midway through a TV series often is death but "Friday Night Lights" pulls this off

After Season 3 we had an inkling of what was to come but a whole new cast of characters was added as Coach Taylor takes over the very rundown and neglected East Dillon (located in the poor part of town) football program


Some older characters (Matt and Lyla) do flit in and out but Riggins is still front and center even though he has graduated from high school and Landry (or Lance as Coach Taylor still calls him at times) still adds comic relief.The real revelation of the new cast is Michael B
Jordan (yes, that's his real name) who plays Vince the new quarterback of East Dillon
Much of his back story is heartbreaking, but he is the fulcrum around which the entire season revolves around.Of the four seasons so far this is arguably the best just because the established characters and the new ones mesh so well
An amazing piece of both scriptwriting and filmmaking.The extras are same as usual (commentary tracks, deleted scenes and a new decent behind-the-scenes look).

$REVIEW.: I often say that I am a fan of science fiction, but not a fan of science fiction fans.  It has little to do with the clich&eacute; of the nerdy boy at the convention in his Star Trek costume.  Instead, it has to do with how often many of the fans (particularly of TV and movies, less so with books) are not very discriminating with what they like.  If it has lasers, aliens or robots, that is enough; writing and acting are purely secondary.Which explains the Sci-Fi Collector's Set, a quartet of movies that has as its sole virtue a relatively low price.  These are four films made by people who didn't even try to make a good movie:  instead, they merely threw in the standard sci-fi fixtures and knew that there would be a built-in audience.I at least had the fortune to watch these movies in the right order, with the absolute worst first.  That would be The Code Conspiracy.  You know you have a problem right off the bat when the poster states "The Dead Sea Scrolls still hold a deadly secret" and they aren't even mentioned in the movie.  Instead, it deals with the long-since-debunked idea of the Bible Code, which supposedly a professor has discovered and the government wants to suppress.  I won't get too much into the story (it's not really worth mentioning), but suffice it to say that the acting is awful (David Warner, the best in the bunch, has the wisdom to exit early), the directing is awful and the writing is really awful.  And though no particular religion is explicitly promoted, this is obviously tied to that televangelical sort of Christianity that makes Christianity seem mockable.  (This, by the way, seems to explain the inexplicably high IMDB score for this movie; it must have been artificially inflated by TBN and 700 Club fans.)After this horrendousness, things can only improve.  Storm Trooper is an improvement, but just barely.  Of course, any movie that stars Carol Alt may have problems.  The plot deals with a rogue robot soldier who takes refuge at Alt's house, right after she killed her abusive husband.  Mercenaries are called in to clean up the situation, leading to lots of gunplay and an ending that is laughable.  For some reason, Corey Feldman is also in this movie, but if this was supposed to be a casting coup, it doesn't pay off; Feldman's character hardly does anything.The Sender is also pretty bad, although the name value of the actors has gotten a little better.  Michael Madsen plays a soldier whose daughter is a Sender, able to teleport herself and other things.  Aliens are trying to assist her in developing her power; the government, of course, wants her for their own ends.  Robert Vaughn and Dyan Cannon are also in this movie, along with Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey, who shows how limited his acting range is.  If you like lots of car chases - or ridiculous shootouts where two people can take out whole platoons with just pistols - this might be your sort of show.Finally, there is The Invader, a blatant rip-off of Terminator, with Sean Young as the woman who will give birth to a savior, Ben Cross as the alien who will both fertilize and protect her, and Nick Mancuso as the unstoppable villain out to kill her.  Throw in one of the lesser Baldwin brothers, and you have the best in the bunch...but still merely a two star movie.I like watching a good "bad" movie, but these aren't even so-bad-they're-good.  They're just plain terrible.  You can probably get this set at a cheap price, but even for free, this set is too expensive.

$review_text.: This is a very strong, though not perfect, two-hour collection. It collects just about every bit of film footage we have of Oswald (except for some color film of him on a New Orleans street which surfaced in the last few years), and excerpts from the New Orleans radio interview. It demonstrates what an intelligent and articulate young man Oswald was, going against the official stereotype of him as an uneducated nobody.There is a bit too much reliance on David Kaiser, who believes that Oswald killed JFK and that the "backyard photos" are genuine. Russell discusses the Richard Case Nagell story and Newman talks about Mexico City. Veciana tells about seeing Oswald meeting with an agent he knew as Maurice Bishop in Dallas. A caption reveals that Veciana recently disclosed that "Bishop" was CIA officer David Atlee Phillips. Also included is a brief color clip of Phillips at Win Scott's wedding in December 1962.The Sylvia Odio and Mexico City incidents are examined from different angles.There is an old interview (looks like late 1960s) with Loran Hall that I'd never seen before where he talks about being briefly jailed in Dallas before the assassination. I was amazed that he doesn't have the slightest trace of a Cuban accent. He sounds like he's from California. An excerpt from a phone interview from the late 70s is misused by Kaiser to link Hall and Santo Trafficante to the assassination. However, during his testimony to the HSCA in 1977, Hall makes it clear that he is referring to the Bayo-Pawley raid rather than the killing of Kennedy.There is vintage footage of an Allen Dulles interview in 1965, and a 1968 George de Mohrenschildt interview. He is asked whether Oswald was a friend or an enemy of President Kennedy. De Mohrenschildt replies, "He definitely was not an enemy. He was an admirer of President Kennedy. From his point of view, he was an excellent President and his ideas corresponded very well with President Kennedy's ideas and vice versa." At one point he refers to him as "Harvey Lee Oswald," as so many people did (government documents before the assassination, Clay Shaw, even Robert Kennedy). De Mohrenschildt laughs at the government's idea that a lunatic killed a lunatic who killed the President, and now another lunatic (Jim Garrison) is reopening the investigation - are there really so many lunatics in America?There is also 1964 film footage of a Ruth Paine interview. As with all her interviews, they reveal (like Oswald) a serious, disciplined, intelligent person who stays on message. I'd never seen the film of Gen. Walker being interviewed right after the "assassination attempt," and he appears to be almost smirking as he describes it.There are many samples of Oswald's writings, his evolving political views, his rejection of capitalism, communism and socialism, and his attempts to find another social-democratic alternative. He talks about the possibility of a military coup overthrowing the US government, possibly being organized by the Marines. Oswald also talked about how much Russia and the US needed to work out their differences "because our two countries have too much to offer each other than to be tearing at each other's throats in an endless Cold War."Since this is a documentary about Oswald, there is a bit too much footage of Jack (and Jackie in Spanish) talking hawkishly about Cuba from the 1960 campaign, without any discussion of the back-channel talks JFK was having with Castro in late 1963 about normalizing relations with Cuba. There is only a brief mention of JFK's tensions with the military leadership (some clips from the film Seven Days in May and discussion of Gen. Edwin Walker are included - no mention of Generals Lemnitzer and LeMay, Admiral Anderson and SAC Commander Thomas Power).

However, having just recently seen the movie, I was delighted to find the entire "vines" part of the T-Rex fight included in its entirety at the end of the second DVD.  It was one of my very favorite parts of the movie, so it was cool to be able to watch it again at home.  As for the rest of the DVD, it's a film nerd's dream look at the making of a blockbuster movie like King Kong, richly detailed and presented with a good deal of humor.  (The April 1st production diary is great!)Recommended for anyone who enjoyed the film and wondered how they put it together.

$REVIEW.: While I was watching Rob Zombie's new "Halloween," I was truly amazed by two things: its length and violence. Having seen his films "House of 1000 Corpses" and "The Devil's Rejects," I knew what I was going to see in this revamped version, but I never expected he would spend so much time (more than 30 minutes) to show Michael Myers as a 10-year-old bullied boy (played by Daeg Faerch, who is certainly convincing).I will not write here the details of his family; I only say it is not very pleasant to see, but maybe that is the point. Maybe Rob Zombie is just trying to give Michael a social background, something few people care. I am afraid it only deprives this horror icon of its superhuman presence. Tyler Mane did a very good job as grown-up Michael Myers, but the long introductory part that tried to (sort of) explain him has made the new "Halloween" just another serial killer movie.And this film is very gory. It also has nudities (more than once). Not that I am complaining. Screaming Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is again chased by Michael Myers, and to his credit Rob Zombie has made each sequence competently, but that is all. What is shown here looks clich&eacute;d, familiar to those who have seen other slasher films, except the unique cast including William Forsythe, Danny Trejo, Bill Moseley, Brad Dourif, Richard Lynch, Dee Wallace, Sid Haig and Sybil Danning. Blink your eyes and you will miss Udo Kier and Clint Howard. (And ex-Monkees Micky Dolenz? Where was he?)I have watched the original "Halloween" long time ago, but I still remember some of the film's scenes were really creepy. But they were not about Michael Myers as killing machine murdering his victims; they were about Michael Myers just standing in the street as if he is something supernatural coming from another world. From the strictly technical viewpoint, Rob Zombie's re-imagined version is decent. It is only that John Carpenter's vision is replaced by Zombie's relentless descriptions of violence, which was seen in his previous films. It was about time to move on.

$REVIEW.: "Magnolia" is a long, depressing, sad, and tragic movie that is done in a very beautiful and unique way.  Very rarely does a film like this come by.  The film is complex, but it doesn't try to follow a basic plot structure.  Characters talk like real people, instead of just talking about things that center around the plot or point.  I do admit that the first time I saw this movie, I didn't really like it that much.  I knew that I didn't hate it, but it was something that I didn't really care for at the time.I decided to re-evaluate it after seeing P.T. Anderson's masterpiece, "Punch-Drunk Love."  I fell in love with it immediately.  You know how all the critics were saying that seeing that movie really makes you want to re-evaluate Adam Sandler?  Well, I decided to do the opposite.  I was already impressed with Sandler long before that movie, so I decided to re-evaluate P.T. Anderson.  So, I decided to give "Magnolia" another chance.  And I am really glad, because this time around, I really enjoyed it.The movie focuses around several different characters, who seem to have a connection somehow with one another.  It all takes place in the time frame of one day, and with that day comes revelations, strange situations, confessions, and redemption.  It's like a bunch of different stories, but they're all happening at the same time.  We keep going back from character to character.  Each character is either being troubled, hiding a dark secret, looking for some kind of redemption, running away from the past, or dying.  This film is about coincidence and chance; secrets and confessions; blame and forgiveness; sorrow and pain; and most importantly, redemption and rebirth.There are so many different stars that were in this non-commercial film.  It really reminds you of the power that took place in Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction."  The cast includes such stars as Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, Jeremy Blackman, and many more.  They all do a fantastic job in this very difficult movie.P.T. (Paul Thomas) Anderson is quite the writer/director.  He was able to make a very complex film that doesn't have to revolve around plot.  There isn't just one idea going around in the movie; there's dozens of them!  Each person who watches the movie is bound to take something different from it.  The writing and directing was really amazing.The DVD has a few extras to offer.  Those extras are the "Frank T.J. Mackey seminar," the Mackey infomercial, a teaser and theatrical trailer, TV spots, the "save me" music video, and a documentary of the making of "Magnolia" that is over 70 minutes long!  The picture quality was very crystal clear and the sound was very high quality.Be warned, this is not a film that everyone is going to like.  If you do not have the time nor patience, then do not attempt this one.  The film is 3 HOURS LONG!  That's right: 3 HOURS LONG!  It's a very depressing and tragic movie, but it is done in such an impressive and unique way.  If you want a movie with a point that is very clear, a very identifiable plot, or a quickly paced story, skip it.  Don't even bother putting this in your DVD player, or VCR player.  This is a film that you will either love it, or you will hate it.  Just be warned.I am glad that I took the time to revisit this film.  I really did enjoy it more the second time around.  I wasn't prepared for a 3 hour long and depressing tragedy when I watched it the first time awhile back.  Now, I was able to let it soak inside my mind and fully appreciate it for what it was.  This is not a commercial-friendly film; this is not a film that is going to be loved by the majority; but to those who do end up enjoying it will be rewarded big time.  Overall, "Magnolia" is about second chances.  I am glad that I did just that, and gave it a second chance.  Maybe this is a film that the more you see it, the more you appreciate it.  A very, VERY impressive film from Mr. Anderson, indeed.

$REVIEW.: I must say, this movie definately falls under the same category as other excellent films about the supernatural (i.e. The Sixth Sense and What Lies Beneath). And like those films that would come nearly three decades later, this film has an unexpected plot twist that makes you think and takes you by surprise. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are nothing but excellent in the roles they are given, and the plot is definately, and enjoyably ambiguous. Not only are there plenty of twists and turns in this film, there are plenty of shocking moments that are just unexpected. Truth be told, I think the lovemaking scene between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie was really the real thing. Much like the ones depicted between Sir Anthony Hopkins and Ann-Margret in Magic and Bruce Dern and Maud Adams in Tatoo. Overall, Don't Look Now is a very suspenseful horror art film. One that is not only a classic, but one that is truly bound to make you jump and think about a few things.If you like this film with Donald Sutherland, you will also like his roles in MASH, The Dirty Dozen, Kelly's Heroes, Bear Island, Revolution, and Ordinary People.

$REVIEW.: THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is one of those rare films that make you truly appreciate the fine art that moviemaking can be. By now, you who are reading this already know the basic story: Set in the 1950's, a young drifter from New York by the name of Tom Ripley (played to subtle but intense perfection by the talented Matt Damon) befriends, and insinuates himself into the lives of, rich spoiled Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) and his girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) in coastal Italy after being sent there by Dickie's rich industrialist father. Mr. Greenleaf merely wants his slacker son to come back to New York and take a managerial position in his company, but Tom has different plans which gradually become more and more revealed during the first half of the film. Dickie doesn't want to come back to the States, anyway; he's having far too much fun with his new friend Tom, who introduced himself as someone Dickie knew while at Princeton University. While Dickie never fully believed this story, Tom somehow intrigues him with his many abilities, such as with languages, and his quiet and irrespressible charm. The main benefit Tom provides Dickie with is male companionship, which becomes a source of shame to the promiscuously bisexual Dickie, who cheats on his would-be fiance` with members of both sexes. In the meantime, the fully homosexual Tom develops an obsessive crush on Dickie.  When Dickie begins to rebuff him, Tom learns quickly how to use his friend's philanderous ways to his own advantage. How he does this you may already know by now, but what makes THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY so engrossing is not merely the events that play out, but how each character's flaws play off of each other, and how the situation gradually snowballs to a conclusion that is as unavoidable as it is unpalatable.The events of this story also involve intriguing supporting characters that are played by the always-uniquely-cast Philip Seymour Hoffman (who has built up his film career with impressive supporting roles in successful films such as TWISTER and BOOGIE NIGHTS to FLAWLESS, ALMOST FAMOUS, and now this film) and the always-appealing Cate Blanchett (as radiant here as she was in ELIZABETH). They help round out the flavor of the film as well as helping to create some of the more pivotal moments in it.This film is an intensive period character study that presents a time and a place where urges were joyfully pursued but always hidden, and were never, ever discussed in public. Plus, the film's breathtaking scenes, which were shot on location in places like coastal Genoa, the ruins of ancient Rome, and the canals of Venice, provide a perfect backdrop for these characters and their decadent, not-quite-liberated lifestyles.Anthony Minghella, who wrote and directed this movie, adapted Patricia Highsmith's novel far more successfully than he did THE ENGLISH PATIENT, which I found to be quite ponderous in certain areas. Although it didn't win nearly as many Oscars, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY never gives you the feeling that it's straying off its central plot. However, you never feel like you know exactly what's going to come next during any given scene.  This movie is so well constructed that you just HAVE to stay with it to find out how it all turns out. When you do, you are rewarded with a conclusion that is both disturbing and real, and certainly does not feel contrived by any means. If only 'true stories' presented on film had as much of a mastery and understanding of human emotions; then we'd have more films that are as transfixing as this one is!Definite recommendation to buy.

$review_text.: I dont understand the horrible reviews here!  This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  Maybe people come into this not really knowing what to expect?  So I will say, if you know who Jack Black is, and you think hes funny, then you will love this movie.  Its hilarious.  I wasnt as familiar with Michael Cera, but hes hilarious as well.  This supposedly takes place in year 1AD, but the movie is filled with modern day language and terminology.  So that is one aspect that makes this movie funny.  For example, in the beginning of the movie they are referring to themselves as hunters and gatherers.  I just thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  And if youre interested, I suggest you ignore these ridiculously bad reviews and check this movie out.  I'm ordering it on Blu-Ray now...

Its has alot of gore so it is not recommended for the faint at heart, but that's what makes it so great.  It shows the brutality of war and introduces William Wallace, a man in Scotish  history that most people never heard of, and made Scotish people swell with pride. Mel Gibson did an outstanding job directing and acting in this movie. Its entertaining and educational at the same time.  I can go on and on about this movie. If you havent seen it yet, your missing out on a classic that will endure for many years. This movie is truly made for DVD owners, and it will keep you at the edge of your seat with smartly directed battle scenes.....YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE!

$review_text.: Koch Vision and BBC presents "THE CATHERINE COOKSON ANTHOLOGY" (1995) (1259 mins/Color) (Dolby Digital) --- Dame Catherine Ann Cookson was an English author --- Cookson became Britain's most widely read novelist, while remaining a relatively low-profile figure in the world of celebrity writers --- Her books were inspired by her deprived youth in North East England, the setting for her novels.Cookson took up writing as a form of therapy to tackle her depression, and joined Hastings Writers' Group --- Her first novel, Kate Hannigan, was published in 1950 --- Though it was labelled a romance, she expressed discontent with the stereotype --- Her books were, she said, historical novels about people and conditions she knew --- Cookson had little to do with the London literary circus --- She was always more interested in practicing the art of writing --- Her research could be uncomfortable - going down a mine, for instance, because her heroine came from a mining area --- Having in her youth wanted to write about "above stairs" in grand houses, she later and successfully concentrated on people ground down by circumstances, taking care to know them well.Cookson went on to write almost 100 books, selling more than 123 million copies of her books, her works being translated into at least 20 languages --- She also authored books under the pseudonyms Catherine Marchant and a name derived from her childhood name, Katie McMullen --- She remained the most borrowed author from public libraries in the UK for more than 20 years, only losing the title in 2004, which is testament to the ongoing popularity of her novels.(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)Here are the seven films featured in the eight-disc The Catherine Cookson Anthology, a few are as described on the box set's gatefold:1.  The Cinder Path - (12 February 1995)The downtrodden son of a farmer, married to one woman but in love with her sister, ships off to World War I in search of glory and redemption. On the front lines, he must battle not only the enemy but also the demons of self-doubt which have plagued him throughout his life.2.  Colour Blind - (16 December 1998)Bridget seriously offends her conservative family for marrying an African sailor. After being accused of murder, her husband is forced to leave town. As their daughter grows up, she must learn to cope with the racism surrounding her.3.  A Dinner of Herbs - (24 November 2000)Hal was just a boy when his father was murdered by the ruthless Dan Bannerman. Now, with a family of his own, Hal discovers that the man his daughter hopes to marry is none other than Bannerman's grandson --- Filmed on location in the north of England, "A Dinner of Herbs" is an unforgettable mix of murder, passion and revenge!4.  The Girl - (16 February 1996)"The Girl" focuses on a young woman who must overcome emotional and physical obstacles to finally come into the life she deserves. This tale is no different. The performances are excellent, and the costuming and locations equally well done.The acting is top notch, and the scenery and production are beautiful.5.  The Secret - (21 January 2000)Freddie Musgrave's life is in a state of turmoil when a letter implicates him in murder. Further complications arise when he discovers he has feelings for Belle, a woman married to a madman. In the late 1880's reformed smuggler Freddie Musgrave has worked hard to turn a legitimate trade, but then a face from his past turns up threatening to ruin things for him.6.  The Tide of Life - (1996)The story line and plot, follows the fortunes of young housekeeper, Emily Kennedy, (Gillian Kearney) as she learns about relationships with three very different men. Forced from home of her first employer, Sep McGilby (John Bowler) after his plans to marry her come to tragic end, Emily finds work as housekeeper for farmer, Larry Birch (Ray Stevenson). Another tragedy occurs, and when Nick Stuart (James Purefoy) inherits the farm owned by Birch's wife, Nick gives Emily a new future.7.  Tilly Trotter - (8 January 1999)Set in rural England during the 1930s, Tilly Trotter is the compelling story of a courageous young girl, envied by women and lusted after by men, who is accused of witchcraft, and forced to rise above the prejudice of her community.BIOS:Catherine Cookson (aka: Catherine Ann Davies)Date of Birth:  27 June 1906 - Tyne Dock, South Shields, England, UKDate of Death:  11 June 1998 - London, England, UK (blood disorder; heart ailment)Great job by Koch Vision --- looking forward to more high quality titles from the BBC Collection film market --- order your copy now from Amazon or Koch Vision where there are plenty of copies available on DVD, stay tuned once again for top notch releases --- where they are experts in releasing long forgotten films and treasures to the collector.Total Time: 1259 mins on DVD ~ Koch Vision KOCV-6511 ~ (1/22/2008)

$review_text.: In the end this movie is just plain silly; but that does not mean I didn't like it


The style is fascinating

The gore is plentiful

The action is fast and furious

Every young man has six-pack abs and all the women were sexy and beautiful


The Spartan ideal of the best way to die is in battle so your name will live on in glory


Freedom is worth any sacrifice


Great movies like "Henry V", "The Charge of the Light Brigade" and "Braveheart" use the same themes


The movie places the famous Spartan quotes in context like "Either return with your shield or on it" and Leonides's quote about "We will fight in the shade." This was pretty cool.The "BraveHeart" ending that the death of Leonides and the 300 at Thermopylae inspired the Greek city states to join together to fight the Persians was touching
In many ways 300 is like Braveheart on steroids.The movie delivers just what you expect from the previews
I thought "Sin City" a better movie, but I had fun watching 300 and it in some ways exceeded my expectations.

$review_text.: Other than the desire to hear the ka-ching from box office receipts and Blu-ray sales, I'm not quite sure why this movie was made. Every time the actor playing a superhero changes, there needs to be a brand new movie rehashing the superhero's origins? More than a rehash, the origin has to be modified? I don't see the point, but it's okay with Marvel, and Marvel has the only vote that counts. Maybe in the next series of Spiderman movies, Peter Parker will be infected by nanobot spiders or bitten by a spider from Neptune. As long as people will pay to see the movie, Marvel will approve.Why not just take it as a given that we all know Spiderman's origin and do something to move the character forward instead of starting fresh? Particularly when the fresh start is as bland as this one. The story is mundane and too often cheesy. It felt like the writers needed to get this out of the way so they could move onto something more interesting. I hope they manage to cobble together a story worth filming before Andrew Garfield gets too old for the part (or too fat to fit into the tights).Since the story isn't worth telling (or retelling), the movie's only value lies in the action scenes. The early action sequences are filled with jump cuts. I know that's trendy, but in this case, it's also lazy. Continuous action creates a sense of realism but it's much harder to film. Stringing together bits and pieces of action and calling it "edgy" is a poor substitute for filming an action scene that looks like it's actually happening. Fortunately there was less of that as the movie went on, and mercifully little of the super-slow-mo that's also become unbearably trendy. In most other respects the special effects are entertaining -- as they should be in a superhero movie -- although the lizard villain looks like he was recycled from a bunch of other movies. A sequence involving a bunch of crane operators is difficult to believe (they all managed to get to their cranes and line them all up in a matter of minutes in the middle of the night?) but spectacular to watch -- by far the best part of the film. Let's hear it for the working man -- the movie's true hero.I don't know about the casting. Ridiculously good looking guys with perfect hair are not awkward around girls. At some points, Garfield plays the part like he's on an extended acid trip. Of course, if you were raised by Sally Fields, you'd be hallucinating too. At other points, Garfield plays the part like he's James Dean ... or James Dean on acid. I think Garfield gave it his best shot but he's just wrong for the part.I understand it may have been necessary to make a Spiderman move to avoid losing licensing rights, but that doesn't explain why anyone thought it was necessary to make THIS movie, covering well-trod ground. The bottom line is that you could watch this movie with the sound off and not miss much.

$review_text.: So what do I do; I BUY THE MOVIE!!!  Luckily for me, this movie isn't nearly as bad as I had feared
 The prominent feeling surrounding this flick is deception
Heck, even the cover art is misleading; that picture never happens in the film


People who hate "Bad Dreams" wanted a "Nightmare on Elm Street" monster/slasher

 I was open for anything since buying this was an after-thought


 When this finally ended, I was pleasantly surprised

 But before I deceive you into thinking this is cinematic brilliance, we should look deeper...(I don't know if I can review this without spoiling it in some way, even though I will never say anything specific about anything that happens in the movie)-AN AMALGAM OF SUB-GENREThat's my favorite new word; "amalgam"

 It happens to work well here
 You see, what you see is not exactly what you get, but what you get is worth seeing
 At one point in this film you might sneer at the attempt at a "Freddy Krueger" re-hash
 When the various modes of killing start, you might suspect a twist of `The Omen" has been tossed in
 However, when it's all said and done, you were completely deceived and surprisingly, it all makes sense.-DEATH BE NOT PROUD.If that last bit sounds intriguing, don't get too excited


 I'm going to temper things a bit

 Yes, there are some unusual modes of death, but you don't really get to see them all and they aren't particularly creative


 Usually, the gore is saved for the aftermath

 There are some graphic gore moments but they're not what you'd expect or are accustom to
 Regardless, there is a lot of blood and some very uncomfortable violence that is disturbing even if it's not all that realistic
 And as long as we are in the gore mode, I should let you know there is no nudity at all
 You will probably be thankful for this since most of the characters wouldn't do it for you anyway.-MOSTLY UNREMARKABLE.The actors in this film are ok
 Nobody stands out


 They dutifully do their jobs without adverse or advantageous affect

 They simply move the plot along in convincing enough fashion


 The camera work is standard fare with no groundbreaking or note worthy shots


 It looks a lot like other movies made in the late 80s; very clean and unremarkable
 Visually, the story is told in a very straightforward way


 I didn't notice the music, which isn't a bad thing
 It mostly stays out of the way while still preserving an uneasy mood
 The story, however, was different and a complete surprise

 I wasn't sure it started that way, but that's where it ended up.-HANG ON SLOOPY!!And hang and hang and hang
 Perhaps the thing that bugged me most about "Bad Dreams" other than the really bad title was the ending
 Not necessarily how the story played out, but how the action played out

 We get some human stamina and endurance plausibility issues as well as shirking the laws of physics


 As it is done in this film, it has been done in dozens of other films

 I never liked when it happens, ever

 I can only forgive this to a certain level as a bad choice
 An endless number of other scenarios could have put plausibility in a better position without changing the plot at all
 Despite this, the ending is a stunner for those with an open mind and a huge disappointment for those with the wrong expectations.-WHAT EXPECTATIONS MIGHT THOSE BE, EK?Don't go into this film looking for a monster/slasher


 This is a psychological mystery in the most literal sense
 It has plenty of creepy moments but is not particularly scary


 The blood and gore is present and a bit overdone at times, but still amps up the fun a little bit since the pace is just a little slow


 Even though it's not a mile-a-minute horror film, "Bad Dreams" was always interesting for me
 My recommendations are very specific for this film.-you're not looking for the typical 80s slasher.-You don't mind a slightly slow pace and moderate character development.-You don't expect any ground breaking visuals.-You like to be surprised by the story.Though not a great film, the story is unique for the time it was made and may surprise you even today
 A good rental for sure.-Story.....4.5 Stars-Acting...3.5 Stars-Gore......3.5 Stars-Visuals...3.5 Stars-E=MC2..2.5 StarsAverage= 3.5 Stars (amazon really needs more stars)

$review_text.: This review is for the Blue Underground DVD release of Nightmare City with some extended information to inform potential buyers.  As has been said, this DVD is exactly the same as Anchor Bay's 2002 DVD release except it has a different cover to it.  Even the text and images on the back of the DVD case are the same.  The 2 extras are the same as well.  Tales Of The Contaminated City, an interview with the film's director, Umberto Lenzi.  Lastly, included is the original theatrical trailer.So, if you own the Anchor Bay DVD and are expecting new extras on this DVD release, you're out of luck.  It's exactly the same disc.  But, if you've never owned Nightmare City, I do recommend it.  (Plus, Blue Underground's DVD is cheaper new.)  It's a nice change of pace with blood suckers instead of flesh eaters, super fast super strong zombie like creatures, able to fly airplanes, drive cars, and use garden tools to murder anyone in sight.  Speaking of pace, the film is nicely paced, too.  Lenzi did a good job on the directing in this picture.  One nice touch is the use of a synthesized soundtrack, and early example of its use in movies.

$REVIEW.: A family on a trip take a time-out to visit a side show because Dad needs more photos for his coffee table book.  The W is missing on the sign so they arrive at the side sho run by a creepy one-eyed barker who claims to be ancient but a close-up shows the actor playing the part is probably in his late twenties at best. to add to the laughs later in the film the family runs into a crazy woman they had met previously and she claims the barker is her pappy.To cut to the chase after the family leaves the bogus side sho(a couple of fetus's in jars and a snake in a glass case, dad takes a wrong turn, the car runs out of gas, and soon they find themselves knee-deep in in-bred country. Not only in-bred but mutant in-bred (The Hills Have Eyes, anyone?).  The family fights back but every time they kill one of the mutants, two more show up-family kill two-three more mutants appear and etc..etc and so-on.This film doesn't even fall into the so bad it's good category so BEWARE.  The only thing I find funny is the phony 5 star reviews written by "plants"

$REVIEW.: Much darker and not quite as tightly written or funny as season 1, but still more interesting and original than most things you'll find on TV.Though I wish I had skipped the 29-minute extra called "Taping Nigel: The Gimpening."  It's more than I needed or wanted to know about Gervais, who apparently has a bondage/bdsm fetish which he acts out upon film editor  Nigel Williams who doesn't appear all that comfortable with the prospect...one can't help worrying that he puts up with being bound (by tape, etc) into also sorts of painful and humiliating positions simply because he's got bills to pay OR he is star struck.  Then again, perhaps that's the point of this exercise: that people will allow themselves to be debased and abused just to be close to "stars."  A little too weird for me.

$REVIEW.: Pros of this movie IMO would be the decent action scene, the car chase was the best, good scene loved it
The acting and general scene shots were at expected levels

However, what got me a bit hesitant about letting this movie do its complete run is the fact that the characters all remain indifferently and uninteresting.!!!POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER WARNING!!!One of the biggest flaw that I saw in this movie is that there was not one single character that had me rooting for them


Usually when you watch a bad vs good guy movie such as a police/FBI/Secret agent movie is that you're usually rooting for one or the other and rarely ever the middle


No real person SHOULD remain neutral throughout a movie, at least a good one

You're usually persuaded based on your own personality to eventually and ultimately pick a side


It gives you something to cheer for, like a sports team, what's the use in rooting for both teams? Most people would like to take side with their favorable character or group of characters, partially if not completely and faithfully


It gives them anticipation in hopes that their pick will somehow meet a happy or satisfying ending.In this movie, you can't really side with anyone because there is no "good guy"

Good guy in this situation is put in quotation marks because it does not really represent good, but rather the favorable guy in relation to the eye of the beholder


In the end, you'll find it very hard to root for anyone because no one in particular will stand out or hold favor in your heart because everyone is messed up and the plot and storyline does not assist you in in choosing one

Everyone's character and personality feels a bit indifferent


No one is exceptionally charming, cool, funny, or whatnot.I really dislike the main semi-heroine because of his negative attributes and therefore seek favor towards the bad guy, who in turn after examining throughout the movie, is not much of a better pick


So it left me feeling very passive about the characters.So in conclusion:The major con that made me feel a bit unsatisfied with this movie is that I had no one to root for and all the characters feel boring and lame


Felt like they all came from the same bucket, it was extremely hard to find someone to cheer for


No use watching a sports team that you could care less who wins, same thing applies to this movie.

$review_text.: Plot: Guy professor who teaches classes on US "home grown" terrorists groups. The groups that we were taught about in the 90s . . . Americans . . . for generations . . . wanting to destroy government, not foreigners wanting to invade and destroy us. He not teaches classes about this group because we learn his wife, a former FBI agent, was killed by a bomb. So some people move in next door. One thing leads to another. The guy suspects that his neighbors are terrorists. So you have to decide . . . are they? Or is the guy crazy because of what happened to his wife and what he thinks about all the time given his profession?Comments: This is a liberals dream come true movie. It shows "rednecks" who value their guns killing government agents. It talks about "Christians" who are violent. Etc. And the movie makes you think that they are everywhere and just evil and out to get you. It creates all the suspicions about the people that liberals despise. The problem here is the groups stereotyped in this movie are not the enemy. It is about as fake as the setting. You see a sprawling green campus that is supposed to be George Washington University. GWU is in downtown DC and is lined by city sidewalks. But the camera spans and shows the US Capitol building. Fake. Reston Mall? More fakery in this movie. The drama built up was kinda cheap. You have bright lights shown on the actors' scared faces. You have screaming background music (not an actor screaming but the music) while someone is thumbing through a newspaper or book and sees someone. It is just absurd. The only reason I even gave this movie one star other than I had to select at least one was the ending. It was kinda shocking and clever. But again it played into this "they are everywhere . . . beware of EVERYONE" motif. It is just wrong and irresponsible

$REVIEW.: I am a newcomer to ballet and bought this DVD to mix up my workout routine.  I'm certainly glad I did - this is a great lower body workout that leaves you feeling energized at the end.  The workout is composed of about 30 minutes with the barre (using a chair), 5 minutes of jumping, 10 minutes of Pilates-like ab work and 5 minutes of stretching. I felt the muscles in my thighs working deeper than I have worked them before.  They were actually shaking throughout the abdominal portion!  Furthermore, holding your arms up nearly continuously is great for sculpting your shoulders.  By the time I finished this DVD, I felt like my posture was a little better!The instructor was pleasant, but the biggest downside to this workout is the cuing.  Being new to ballet, I can't follow instructions well without seeing the movement.  There are a few exercises where I had to stop, look at the screen, and rewind to the beginning of the movement.  I agree with some reviewers that not being as flexible as the instructor can be a bit frustrating.  However, she mentions multiple times that the intention of the movement is more important than how flexible you are.Overall, I think this workout is a great change of pace for me.  I do think you need to be mindful of your joints throughout it, but it provides a great challenge otherwise.

$review_text.: A great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy. Director-writer Brian de Palma does a super Hitchcock-imitation (many called it a "ripoff") with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-TV tapes).The downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!).The opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. The film has several erotic scenes in it as Dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups) and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their bodies.There is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is, it's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through, particularly for males ogling the naked women.

$review_text.: Now this is an entire full on movie classic of fun and laughter. The performances by the actors are marvelous and well suited for their roles plus the story is just as great. With just getting out of jail after serving his time for robbery Nick Nolte goes to the bank to cash his check so while been  served a  little man decides he'll rob the bank for money to help his daughters school fees. Now what seems to be an simple little thing turns out to be one hell of a mess, the clock is ticking. Police arrive and surround the bank which leaves little doubt as what happens next, a hostage is needed and of cause Nolte is the hostage much bigger than the robber and wanting nothing to do with it. and to make it worse the cops picked Nolte up from the boat ramp and gave him a lift to the bank so now they think he is guilty and the robber. With so much going on it's a must see show, I have told you some of it and that is all. There is a lot more worth mentioning but why spoil it. So now I rated this an A grade plus classic, fantastic all the way through for full on comedy that will leave you begging for more. Gather up the popcorn, settle in with your feet up and relax for a fabulous night of entertainment with the family.  Enjoy!

This movie knows exactly what it is and exactly what audience is wathcing this movie and caters to them perfectly: the action audience. It has every possible cliche imaginable because it really does stick so perfectly to the genre and pleases its audience greatly. Somehow, even though the movie is so cliche, it pulls every scene off in grand fashion. It truly is surprising to see a movie like this and actually love it. I am a college educated man, yet even I knew I had to buy it. It is just that much fun.It is an action; it stars Arnold; he is a commando...what more is there to action movies!? EXPLOSIONS! FIGHTING! CLICHE BAD GUY MONOLOGUES! HAMMY ACTING! LOOK OUT! Loads of fun are coming your way. If you were to ask me why this movie is so amazingly popular, then all I can say is that sometimes people just need to watch guys get the crap shot and beat out of them by a giant Austrian.Wonderful movie! 5 stars!

$review_text.: Yes, &quot;Titanic&quot; may have been the best spectacle in movie theaters last year, but this was the best movie--chock full of consistently superior writing and acting and replete with a story that treats its  viewers as thinking adults rather than mindless entertainment zombies.  Guy  Peirce and Russell Crowe are outstanding as L.A. cops with diametrically  oppossed ideas of what constitutes &quot;justice&quot; (or so it seems).  You haven't seen good cop/bad cop played like this EVER!  Plus, it's  mind-blowing to hear them both expound in their native Aussie accents  during the documentary footage included on the DVD.  Kevin Spacey and  James Cromwell are also marvelous.  I wasn't all that keen on Kim Basinger,  though, who isn't asked to do much except be pretty.  Everyone else is  certainly acting in Oscar-calibre range.  Despite the convuluted plot,  Curtis Hanson directs in a style that's easy to trust and by the time he  brings us to the home stretch, I was sitting on the edge of my seat.  There's never been a movie this smart with this high a body count.  Dark,  beautiful, brutal and brilliant.

$REVIEW.: An Ok movie worthy of watching once. Freddys Dead had a lot of good moments like the cool death scenes and the special effects, but it also had its bad moments to. The plot was stale and the the movie was very slow, to  the point of total boredom through the first 45 minutes of the film. And  the ending could have been a lot better in my opinion. It does tell us a  lot about Freddys past, including the bolier room death. And it even went  as far as to show the Actual demon possesion of Freddy that turned him in  to the horribly disfigured dream stalker that he is today. Although this  movie has a lot of graphic viloence it isnt as bad as 4 and 5 but still  holds its own.

$REVIEW.: In CARRIERS, a viral infection has destroyed all of mankind, leaving only a few survivors to fend for themselves as they attempt to find a safe haven free from contagion. Fear and paranoia set in as a group of four find out that their precautions have failed and one of them has contracted the deadly disease, putting the others in immediate danger. CARRIERS does an amazing job at conveying a post-apocalyptic wasteland on a very modest budget. The ravished streets and empty buildings give a true sense of devastation on a grand scale. Each of the actors put forth strong performances as they balance the lighter moments in the script with the psychological struggles later on. What makes the film the most difficult to watch are the scenes involving the infected children, where the adults that are conscious of the terminal effects of the disease must make heartbreaking decisions in order to end their suffering. Unlike in 28 DAYS LATER, the infected only pose a risk of contamination rather than creating bloodthirsty monsters, which forces the plot to rely on the darker aspects of humanity to drive the tension and suspense. The biggest complaint would have to be the overall lack of direction or purpose that the film presents, along with its down ending. CARRIERS comes from the same line of paranoid cinema as its Independent brethren BUG and RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR, and makes for another solid entry in the Post-Apocalyptic sub-genre.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies

My daughter would come running everytime from different rooms to see the cartoon cow on Susie's head.  Heck--so would I.So for my daughter's 4th birthday she received this awesome DVD from her grandparents. I have been so very happy with the product. I especially love "Pig on her Head","Telephone", "Walk Along the River", "I Know a Chicken", and the lollybye (as misprounced by my daughter) "Moon, Moon, Moon".Along with Laurie is Brian Mueller and Susie Lampert.  They are excellent entertainers.  They are all so vital dancing around and are uninhibited and seem so spontaneous.  And I love how they use children in this DVD to sing and dance with them.I wish I could be a mom who could whip out a guitar and sing sweet songs to my child.  At least Laurie's voice which is homey and warm is in a range where I can sound pretty good myself.  The harmony between the threesome is beautiful.

$REVIEW.: I won't rehash the plot
It's simply a wonderfully observed crumbling of a marriage probably never built on the healthiest of foundations in the first place


 One could say that the movie is perhaps an indictment of materialism, where we see Kathleen Turner's character finally turning bitter when she's done all the decorating she can, and Michael Douglas is too busy earning money to care that his wife is feeling empty now

 Whose fault is it that the marriage is a shambles?  Did Douglas continue to quest for more and more money to make himself feel good about himself and to keep his wife happy...and did she encourage it but continuing to spend, spend, spend?  And when the ruins are revealed, it isn't emotional territory, as such, that they fight over, but the material goods that have come to represent emotional attachment for them.All that may be, but what is so great about the movie is its unrelenting viciousness once the barbs start flying


 When Turner tells Douglas she had to pull off to the side of the road when she thought he might be dieing from a heart attack because &quot;she was happy&quot; he might pass away...wow, if that ain't a slap in the face??It's interesting that Turner is really the hard case in this


 Douglas keeps saying that he's still in love with her


 He keeps softening towards Turner, and she rebuffs him with her jaw set more and more firmly

 Yet, is he really in love with her, or just feels he can &quot;get her back&quot; to put back on his trophy case

He probably doesn't know either...combination of the two, I'd say.The movie is keenly observed, and the lead performances are flawless,really

 Our sympathies bounce back and forth, back and forth all the time
 And because we're watching a glossy Hollywood movie, in the back of our minds, we're expecting it all to turn out OKAY

 Sure, they say things and do things no human can be forgiven for, but what the heck...it's a movie


 I congratulate all involved for having the courage of their convictions
 This is a BLACK comedy in all the best ways

 The final action Turner takes with Douglas, as they lay side by side, is PERFECT!!  I hadn't seen the movie in years until the other day, but many of her comments and actions were burned in my memory


 These two actors had such great chemistry


 A reteaming, even after all these years, might be fun.Anyway, my one gripe about the movie is the role of &quot;narrator&quot; that DeVito plays


 He's an attorney (and partner of Douglas'), who, in his scenes WITH Douglas, is quite amusing
 But he also interjects little comments from time to time as he is retelling the story of the Roses to a prospective client


 The tone of these scenes is unconvincing, DeVito does a terrible job of smoking (don't ask), and they add nothing to our appreciation of the &quot;message.&quot;  Maybe the movie wasn't long enough without these scenes...but I could sure do without them.By the way,the DVD has a montage of deleted scenes, &quot;hosted&quot; by DeVito

 It's worth watching, right through to the end, because DeVito (and his wife, Rhea Pearlman) have a very brief but delightful &quot;scene&quot; at the conclusion.This is a great movie, and a lost treasure, in many ways, because so few people gave it a try when it came out

 It still holds quite true today, I think, and despite the slightly outdated fashions in the film, remains timeless.

$review_text.: This movie is a secular polemic against Orthodox Judaism, and should be understood as a part of &quot;the struggle for Israel's soul.&quot; It satires fundamentalists in Israel, especially lamenting the tragedy in the lives of some women. Despite all the politics, the movie really is beautiful. Developing slowly, with very patient cinematography, this movie achieves a remarkable and understated emotional depth. The lighting in this movie is especially incredible.I hope that it helps us better understand life in Israel, but I also hope most people find more balanced views of Orthodoxy.

Godzilla can also get outrun by a homeless bum on a wooden dock. Riiight! Plus the military are also apparently blind, as Godzilla dodges every fu#@ing projectile shot at him/her.

This alone makes the show an absolute must see!! but only for viewers with a good sense of humor, open-mindedness and patience.I felt a bit guilty for my critical reaction to the show, being it was filmed rather raw....one camera, few props, as well as inappropriate 'glam' makeup and hair styles, ranging from Olivia Newton-John, to Farrah, to 80's Punk and ending with Dallas BIG!The pureness of the stories told, about a group of women trying to get along with one another, and trying to get thru every day of their prison sentence, almost requires an empathetic viewer!

 I have probably seen all his movies, but it wasn't until I saw this one did I realize just how great an actor Danny truly is


 He teachs a bunch of Army misfits and turns them into 'lean, mean, learning machines'
 Not by just giving assignments in Shakespeare to be completed, but by making them want to do them and understand Shakespeare's mind and his character development
By the end it will be just another "feel good movie" for sure

The made-up animals are fun to watch for, and the family dynamics are very realistic. The family has it's hard times but they all learn to respect each other's strengths and weaknesses. The whole plot is so preposterous it's obvious the animators were trying to shy away from any scientific argument and just wanted to make a fun story about some cave-dwelling people.My husband and I laughed out loud several times, and my kids giggled through the whole thing.

$review_text.: Thunderball is one of the better James Bond movies in the set of Bond.  I have heard the rumours about the underwater fight scene being edited but in my personal viewpoint still an amazing fight scene and very well filmed for the movie.  The movie plotline was actual very believeable about stealing a weapon and holding it for a money trade off in exchange for where the weapon is located.  I also would like to add that I thought Sean Connery was in one of his best phsyical shapes as James Bond base on the fight scenes and action stunts unless they used a stunt man.  I thought every actor did a great job with what they had to work with and the added benifit of the dance scene and all that music going on very impressive turn out.  I look forward to many more James Bond movies and writing up much more reviews of them to come as I watch them.  So watch this one with an open mind and make up your own mind weither you enjoy it as much as me or not.

$REVIEW.: I love this movie. I've enjoyed this film for years after first seeing it on TV back in the 70's/80's. I knew William Shatner as Rack Hansen long before I realized he was better known for piloting a "starship". "Kingdom of the Spiders" was a staple on my local light night creature feature growing up. I haven't seen it in years, but still vividly remembered it (especially the girl on the swing scene!!!). I finally got around to watching the DVD treatment, and am happy to say it's still a great movie gauranteed to give you a creeping case of the willies."Kingdom of the Spiders" is another 1970's nature-gone-crazy flick. It came out when a plethora of such films were filling movie and drive-in screens every week, movies like "The Pack", "Grizzly", "Day of the Animals", "The Swarm" and "Prophecy" all featured hapless town folk and tourists meeting the worst nature has to offer. I guess thanks to "Jaws" Hollywood saw a chance to make some money and pumped these suckers out left and right. "Kingdom of the Spiders" actually works and delivers the chills you would want. How could it not? I mean the movie's premise is that tens of thousands of highly venomous tarantulas are over-running a small town. If you are as creeped out by spiders as I am...you will get goosebumps. And what makes it better is that these are the genuine item, real creepy crawlie spiders...not CGI.So if you are looking for a fun little movie, one that has some unintentionally funny moments as well as some real chills, you should pick this up. You can't ask for more than William Shatner and 10,000 spiders all trying to share screen time!

 I would think it would show the continuing lives of the characters as they got older in a positive way


 Instead it was a doom and gloom movie


 Everything seeemed to go wrong

 This was supprising after the end of the series that showed things going so well and open hearts

 They seemed to lack compassion
 I was sorry that I went to the movie theatre and actually paid to see this movie
 Everyone is different but I cannot for the life of me see why more positive things were not in the movie and the growing lives of the characters

 Instead they seemed to move backwards in their growth

 The series, "Sex and the City" is by far much better.

$review_text.: I recommended this great film to a friend, who gave up on it mid-waythrough

 It's true that this movie is not conventionally entertaining,and the players are more like symbols than real people

 The deliberatepace, and depictions of cruelty would be challenging to many viewers.Regardless, to me this is just about the deepest film I've ever seen,because it contemplates the evil rottenness in this world, and finallysays, God loves the meek most of all

 The conclusion of "Balthazar"redeems the troubling sadness of the story with a gentle miracle, andI've never seen a more moving ending to any film.Some reviewers have asserted that the abuse of the donkey was genuine.I can think of safe ways of simulating all the "abuse" that would causezero suffering to the animal(s) playing Balthazar


Think cardboard cudgelsand balsa-wood chairs for striking, a fake donkey tail and dispersing a bagof powder to look like smoke, or just clever editing for the firecrackersscene


 Furthermore, why would a great director like Bresson alienate hiscast and crew with actual animal abuse?  And why would he risk running upexpense and causing production delays by tormenting his animal star, a naturallycontrary mule, whom he was depending upon to get the film made?  Does it evenmake sense that Bresson would make a film condemning animal abuse while doingit himself?  I cringe at what is done to poor Balthazar, but it is not real.Someone complained that the characters didn't react as would ordinary persons.This movie is meant to be a poetic parable, and not actually "realistic."Bresson preferred flat performances from his nonprofessional actors,without "acting" standing in front of the message of his tale.

$review_text.: This effort keeps the spirit and message of Tolstoy intact. He would have approved.Every film/theater adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace" has naysayers. A novel (originally published in 1869 with 1200+ pages) of this length requires adjustment.Step aside Anna Karenina and make room for "War & Peace." It's just as film-worthy.This is an elegant look at the high social life of Russia with exquisite period costuming as good as any previously created for epic TV drama. Sensational symphony orchestration. A combo dazzling to the eye & ear. This 2007 version has a great international cast. Amazingly it is nearly impossible to recognize at least 9 of the actors were dubbed in English. It's so well done; it is obvious the actors HAD to be speaking English during the filming. After watching over 7 hours of this adapted drama, you'll wish for more. Alas, Tolstoy wrote no sequel.The story remains true to the Tolstoy plot and reveals the character of members of 4 Russian society aristocratic families: Bolkonsky, Rostov, Bezukhov, & Kuragin with a bit added time to Boris Drubetsky. Family relationships drive the plot of interaction between socialites in the Napoleonic invasion period, including romances. Much of the Tolstoy philosophical discussion that makes the book so fantastic is left in the book, but not all.SUBTITLES provided. Unrated but with obvious war violence. This European version refrains from massive gore and blood slinging that seems today to be a must to sell American films.1-- 1805. Natasha (Clemence Poesy) eyes married Prince Andrej (Alessio Boni) who has personal visions of being a hero of fighting men. His friend Pierre (Alexander Beyer) inherits while the country prepares for war against the Napoleon threat. 4 family paths begin to cross. Andrej's father played by Malcolm McDowell, and you'll love to hate him. Aging socialite Marja Dmitrijewna Achrosimowa played by Brenda Blethyn (`Vera').2-- 1811-12. Count Pierre is yet struggling with responsibilities and marriage. There is war-fighting danger to face for the soldiers of the 4 families. Greed, power, and revenge weight heavily; as do romances amid families.3-- Nuptial rumor instigates renewed sabotage attempts on individual's charateer and status. Napoleon's wicked tactics of battle encourages Pierre's inclusion at the Battle of Borodino, Sep 7, 1812.4-- 1813. Residents of Moscow run ahead of Napoleon's advances. Natasha, Marja Bolkonsky (Valentina Cervi), & Pierre all make decisions based on the unfurling tumult. Who will die; who will live on to love?`

$REVIEW.: First off this film is much better than Troy and Alexander combined. Ridley Scott's direction shows that he hasn't lost the ability to manage epics of this size. His talent as a former cinematographer and art director shows in spades in this film. The color palette changes from the cool, almost black and white scenes in France to the blistering earth tones of the scenes in the Middle East. If one can find any faults in Kingdom of Heaven it won't be for its art direction and cinematography. There are faults in this film, but not enough to ruin the film or slow it down the way it did for Troy and, to a greater degree, Alexander. The story seems to not want to create a specific bad guy to root for. Even the characters whose motives and behavior scream "villain" can be excused by their religious veiwpoints. This is one film where everyone involved makes decisions that can be seen as good or bad depending on the individual audience's point of view.The cast did an admirable job in getting lost in their roles. One specific stand-out has to be Ghassan Massoud's portrayal as Muslim General Salah al Din (Saladin to the West). Massoud has presence and is actually one of the few characters who seemed to go beyond the petty, religious politicking this film has piles of. I must admit that I never really believed Orlando Bloom as the character of Balian of Ibelin. He makes a convincing enough knight, but never as the protector of Jerusalem. Eva Green makes for nice eye candy, but I looked closely enough at her character develop and she did a better job as a young married princess much too cynical and old than what her appearance and age would suggest.But most people will come to see Kingdom of Heaven for its many battle set pieces. Outside of The Lord of the Rings battles, Scott's work in pulling off the battles between the Crusader and Templar armies against those of Salah al Din would count as some of the most brutal and massive engagement in film history. Scott did his homework well for these set pieces. As a military history buff I'm usually more critical of epic films depicting historical battles on film. There's not much to be critical about the accuracy of the Siege of Jerusalem. The final battle does look like it owes some of its execution to the Siege of Minas Tirith in the end of LOTR.The film succeeds well enough in recreating the fight for Jerusalem and the politics involved from all sides. The acting is very good overall though a few casting choices could've been made better. Overall this film is very underappreciated. Maybe people are not ready for an intelligent film about a contentious time involving two of today's major religions.

$review_text.: Bought this DVD since the description was interesting, as well as recently having watched Versus, Pyrokinesis, Uzumaki, etc
has carved a respect from me to watch Asian Horror movies post the popularity of Ringu
 I thought this movie would have some substance and at least some art put into it, but none, nada, zilch kaput of anything near my expectations.This movie has NO plot whatsoever, it does not even accomplish anything that is remotely "thrilling", and if you are into gore (I am not), this movie doesnt have any of that


 If you are into necrophillia, perhaps
 There is a scene here that was downright DUHHH, when the evilly hypnotized mother and her daughter hang a dectective while the detective is an arousal state
 Then these two force the other daughter (our protagonist) into having sex with the now-dead detective

 Now what was the point of this scene?  Nothing.And then in the end when the relationship between the protagonist and the long lost brother is revealed, I wonder if the writer was suppose to wow his audience by irrelevant revelation

 At this point, I didnt care anymore
 I wished all of them were dead so I can turn off the movie.I think what made me held on to the movie to the very end was absolute denial that I was watching something as stupid as this movie, and then later on vaccillating if I hung on out of morbid curiosity that the story would get any stupider.One last note, I thought the Asian (being an Asian myself) had gotten rid of the "girl singing in the middle of the movie" parts?  Here is something you dont see in Western movies that the Asians seems to have a copyright on
 Can you imagine Kate Beckinsdale singing right in the middle of Underworld with music in the background?  This cheesy tidbit Asians throw in never assimilated with the West

 Well, in this movie, you get a taste of it

 Happy fast forwarding!

$REVIEW.: Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino play a pair of aging partners in the New York Police Department in this flat crime drama


Over the years, the two officers have grown close
Both men have become disillusioned with life on the beat and with seeing dangerous criminals escape justice based upon what they see as legal technicalities


The two officers have issues with their career choices and with their personal lives, especially women


In the late stages of their careers, the two officers are assigned to pursue a serial killer of criminals who have evaded punishment for their misdeeds.The interaction between DeNiro and Pacino is adequately portrayed at best

 Unfortunately this interaction is not enough to save the movie


The story is told in an unnecessarily disorganized way and the pacing is slow
The scenes of city life, loneliness, grit, violence, and toughness that are essential to any noir movie or film of urban life are lacking
Photography and scenes are routine and uninspired
The result is dullness

These two fine actors, with memories of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull among other things, deserved better.Robin Friedman

 Just look at the cover of the DVD and what do you see?; a Navajo hard at work on a microphone while being shot at or maybe...Nicolas Cage?  This movie had the look and feel of a made for TV movie and was a big letdown

 I would really love to see the story of the Navajo &#34;wind talkers&#34; told with some respect and honesty for those who served in that regard.

$REVIEW.: The Amateurs is a delightful movie about a group of middle-aged men in a small town making a porno movie.  It really reminded me of Nobody's Fool, with Paul Newman.  This is not a porn film, and it is not really dirty.  It is character-driven, with Jeff Bridges in the driver's seat.  All the actor's are engaging (Ted Danson is a hoot, playing against type), and the plot is actually quite sweet.  This film grossed $15K (yes, $15K) during its commercial release.  It seems to be doing better than that with rentals and direct sales now.  If you hate the idea of porn, don't bother with it.  But if you like good movies, the porn aspect is just the hook on which the plot is hung.  Sorry, no pun intended.  My wife loves this movie more than I do, and I like it a lot.  The Blu-ray version is very clean and clear.  Check it out.

$review_text.: I credit two films in particular with endearing me toward robots and robot movies.  One would be the original "Star Wars," with its lovable duo of R2D2 and C3P0.  The other would be a certain cult-classic film with an adorable malfunctioning robot... "Short Circuit."  These movies didn't just show off their technical prowess by creating robots that looked like actual robots instead of cheap puppets, but they imbued them with personality, making them every bit as three-dimensional and personable as the human actors... and oftentimes more likable.While "Short Circuit" isn't a cinematic classic like "Star Wars" and its accompanying franchise, it's a fun and cute movie in its own right.  And its robot character is a lot of fun.Number Five is one of a set of prototype robots developed by Newton, a reclusive scientist, for use on the battlefield.  A lightning strike scrambles Number Five's circuits and gives him something his fellow prototypes don't have... a personality, and a sense of truly being alive.  He escapes the laboratory, causing a panic among the scientists and military when they realize he's still armed with a powerful laser.  Number Five eventually ends up in the care of Stephanie, a feisty animal-loving caterer who first mistakes him for an alien, but comes to realize that even if he's manmade he's still sentient.  But with the military desperate to stop Number Five at any cost, even if it means destroying him, Stephanie must convince Newton that Number Five is truly alive before the unthinkable happens.While the special effects of this film might look somewhat cheesy today, they were quite good for their time.  And in a way, using puppetry and real robots for this film give it a sense of realism that modern CGI just can't duplicate.  Number Five manages to be quite expressive, communicating his emotions and thoughts via posture, eye color, and a rather mobile set of "eyebrows."The acting in this film, while not spectacular, is decent enough that I never felt jarred out of the movie by a bad acting job.  Steve Gutenberg and Ally Sheedy are rather good as Newton and Stephanie respectively, and to this day I have a hard time seeing them as anything besides Newton and Stephanie.  They actually have a decent on-screen chemistry, and while Gutenberg can get goofy at times, it's understandable given that his character is more comfortable around robots than people.  GW Bailey hams it up as Skroeder, the military officer who wants Number Five dead, and while Fisher Stevens has raised some controversy as Ben (the actor is white while the character is Indian), he was fun and hilarious in my opinion.Warning for parents -- this film has some mild profanity and a few genuinely scary moments, including a "war game" scene in the beginning and a couple of shootouts.  Parents might want to screen this movie before letting their children watch, as every child's tolerance level for on-screen action violence is different.By turns cute, exciting, and hilarious, "Short Circuit" is a must-see for fans of '80s cinema, and anyone who enjoys a good robot movie.  Recommended for ages 10 and up.
$SUMMARY.: An adorable robot -- yes, robot -- is the highlight of this film

$review_text.: I found this slice-of-life documentary thoroughly engrossing, but some viewers may find it claustrophobia-inducing
It's not just that chef Kenny Shopsin's restaurant in New York City's Greenwich Village is a ratty hole in the wall, or that his tiny kitchen is a grim, grimy room, or that director Matt Mahurin is a poor digital cameraman, producing herky-jerky images and muffled sound


The problem is primarily this: we get up close and personal with a fat, sweaty, foulmouthed, cantankerous cook and his warts-and-all family, which is probably more intimate than most people would care to be


Yet it's precisely this intense intimacy and complete candor that make the film compelling.From 2002 to 2003, Mahurin followed Shopsin in his final year at the location he ran for over 30 years
In the first half of the film, we watch him open his eatery for the day, talking nearly non-stop about his tools, menu, employees, and guiding principles

We meet regulars and old friends who eat some of the 900 eclectic, oddly named dishes he cooks, and we can't help but notice that patronizing the place requires nearly as much chutzpah and almost as thick a skin as Kenny has: woe betide rule-breakers like the party of five or the customer who just wants a coffee! Shopsin treats all those who get on his nerves to a fresh serving of hot temper or, at the very least, an affectionate phrase beginning with the letter F.Shopsin is constantly breaking into rather disjointed reveries on what he calls his "half-baked philosophy." These irascible harangues are simultaneously misanthropic and amusing, both cynical and laughable, particularly one late in the film in which he expounds upon the importance of humility

He doesn't use that word, however; rather, he expresses his belief that virtually everyone is a selfish piece of excrement (and of course he doesn't use that precise word, either)


When our protagonist's longsuffering wife Eve and their children weigh in on what it's like to work for a man who's both a genius and a jerk, the viewer is forced to sympathize.In the film's second half, Shopsin loses his lease and decides to move his establishment to a larger location in the nearby Lower East Side


Family, friends, and customers all pitch in to make it happen

Everything must go, from hundreds of knick-knacks and supplies to an antediluvian stove that amazes us by failing to explode and incinerate either the old or the new restaurant

The reopening is a resounding success


We return for an epilogue the following year to learn that Shopsin's wife has died but that he hasn't changed a bit
The customer is still always wrong and the cook is always right, even when he's blurting out the most inappropriate things imaginable."I Like Killing Flies" is a classic piece of Americana and an enduring contribution to the tradition of quirky, abrasive New Yorkers who make their city one of the most interesting on earth.

$review_text.: LOST is a complex soap opera with a science fiction, fantasy and philosophical framework. But for most people, it's a show about compelling characters in very strange and mysterious circumstances. The show is accessible on many levels, but to fully appreciate it, one might consider reading all the books that pop up in the hands of characters throughout the show. The show is chock full of symbolic, psychological, philosophical, religious and human speculations. I watched the show, missed probably 12 episodes during its run and was quite lost. I have just completed watching the entire show and think I now  "get it." It's a masterpiece of story telling and exploration. Its six seasons cannot be causally absorbed and appreciated, so the show is perfect as a DVD collectible.

$REVIEW.: Step on in to hell


 This Buddhist vision of the fiery underworld is absolutely stunning


 It also seems to simmer around a collective belief system in regards to death and punishment for sins.The beginning of the movie shows the downfall of a young man who becomes trapped by his own guilt
 The last part of Jigoku depicts the torment and suffering of the damned, literally in hell

 The overall look is remarkably shot and completely haunting
 It's incredibly violent, filled with eerie and desperate images of the lost souls


 You've got bodies being sawed in half or being flayed alive down to the bone


 It's a smorgasboard of brutality
 I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!The only other movie I've seen similar to this is What Dreams May Come


 It's fairly obvious that movie borrowed some hellish ideas from Jigoku.This film has reached cult status, a true masterpiece of horror.

Who could ask for more - a bunch of monsters, baby Godzilla (Minilla), evil space aliens, a mutant army, martial arts battles, submarines, spacecraft and missiles, decent special effects explosions and flames, and guys in rubber suits slugging it out in balsa wood cities (maybe some plastic construction in there now)!

$review_text.: This movie was so cheesy! The writing was poor, the storyline was full of holes, and the dialogue was often unintentionally laughable. Some of the acting was really good, but much of it was awful, and Billy Connolly sounded positively sarcastic--I got the feeling he regretted signing up to do this one and was acting the part under sufference. Worst of all, though, this movie had me siding with the French in the big fight scene! Who the hell would ever WANT to take the side of the French in any fight? Sacre bleu!This movie will never win any awards, except maybe a Raspberry. And yet, I didn't hate it, mostly because of the cool medieval fight scenes. The storming of the castle was amazing, and the 'Greek Fire', 'night arrows' and trebuchets were awesome! (If you're a weapons geek, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about!) The hail of fiery arrows was gorgeously coordinated and filmed, and the battle scenes on the castle ramparts were spine-tingling.If you're looking for a great film then keep looking because this definitely isn't one. But if you're looking for a mildly entertaining movie for a quiet night in, if your expectations aren't at all high, and if you're also fond of medieval times, you might like to give this ago. It'll pass the time, if nothing else, and you probably won't regret it. (Not like Michael Crichton, who undoubtedly has a LOT of regrets about selling the film rights to the book this mediocre movie was based on!)

Gary Gray's ('The Negotiator' w/ Sam Jackson & Kevin Spacey) comeback in top form after the unfortunate Vin Diesel vehicle 'A Man Apart'


Obviously a remake (can't they come up with an original con plot? is it THAT tough?) of a 1960's classic that starred Michael Caine, 'The Italian Job' slightly improves upon the original with stylized editing (a-la 'The Thomas Crown Affair'), tons of sly wit and sexual innuendo between the protagonists (a-la, um,'The Thomas Crown Affair'...), and a rockin' good finale (a-la...you figure it out)
Mark Whalberg looks bored (what happened to him after 'Boogie Nights'?), and the secondary characters are obligatorily exaggerated (the computer wiz/nerd; the smooth locksmith, etc) Ed Norton has fun as the villain though, and Charlize Theron is sexier than ever, but what the film lacks is originality - how hard can it be to improve upon decent material?

$REVIEW.: I always considered DR


NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming
Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant


His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character

He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country
Joseph Wiseman as Dr

No is one of the best villains of the series


His steel mono-toned performance is eerily unsettling
He remains one of the most enigmatic villains in the series
He is a villain moved more by unfounded revenge than by greed or riches

You almost sympathize with him as he makes futile overtures to Bond imploring him to join his organization

It seems that Bond is the only man capable of appreciating his intellect
Not even Dr
No's backers, Blofeld and S.P.E.C.T.R.E


are worthy of his talents

Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder leaves one of the most indelible images of the series as she emerges from the sea clad in her white bikini


She is characterized by the simplicity of her goodness and naivet&eacute; as she is drawn into a vortex of worldliness that Bond further engulfs her in

Rather than that of a supposed sex object, she exudes a raw femininity found only in nature

Bond can not help but feel that he has corrupted her both deliberately and inadvertently in his blind quest to revenge the deaths of fellow agents
This is the very strength of Richard Maibaum's script, here and on subsequent Bond films
These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships
Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend


&#34;Friend&#34; in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually


Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters
John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series


This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man
When called upon in the death struggle of good vs
evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice


Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent seems perfect as a man who knew better than fall into an inescapable web of subterfuge that Dr


No has spread from his island to the mainland
Zena Marshall as Miss Taro is a more willing participant, as she appears eager to overtly display her sensuality and share her sexual appetites openly with Bond


She is supposed to lure Bond to his death

Finding this not the case she enthusiastically offers herself to Bond

It is in these scenes that Sean Connery displays a certain animal screen presence that no other actor has ever equaled in the role
Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film


The opening gun barrel trademark, &#34;The James Bond Theme,&#34; Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the &#34;Martinis shaken not stirred,&#34; just to name a few are all here
Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series
This is quite possibly true when looking at DR


NO

It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters

It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr


No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key
DR

NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt
Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond
But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer


Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond
Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant


DR

NO is the benchmark.THUNDERBALL is a very Nostalgic and Endearing early Bond Film


This film somehow sums up a feeling of nostalgia and endearment for the way it engulfed audiences, myself included, into the wonderful world of James Bond

Sean Connery did it with such effortless and natural charm and aplomb like no other
He's a tough and resourceful blunt instrument with a level of intelligence sophistication still impressive to this day

The world of THUNDERBALL is elegant where the villains live an opulent style of life which is a veneer for their sinister plans
In a bit of irony James Bond lives in that same world and he is up to the challenge to foil whatever mayhem they concoct


After a one-film hiatus SPECTRE returns
So has Sean Connery as he was finally groomed to perfection as the definitive screen incarnation of James Bond in GOLDFINGER
Terence Young is also back as director


However, he seems to have been influenced over the fine-tuning that Guy Hamilton brought to the main character and overall tone of GOLDFINGER

Due to that film's success Young seems to be floundering here being diverted from his vision of the character that he helped bring to the screen
Young is 180 degrees from being the auteur he envisioned himself to be.The film seems loosely constructed and leisurely acted


Adolfo Celi as Emilio Largo looks the part but he never seems a real threat to Bond
In fact he seems to lose every encounter with Bond whether it be at the gambling tables or engaging in idle banter on the merits of women vs
guns

Bond outdoes him in skeet shooting without even looking at the target

What makes the film very memorable is John Barry's rich score and Lamar Boren's beautiful and colorful underwater photography
The two went hand in hand


I also thought the villains' plot to hijack a Vulcan jet was extremely well filmed and executed


This film has a very British feel to as it should have
But going back to John Barry's impressive and complex score for THUNDERBALL, it is here that he truly puts his inimitable stamp on the entire sound for the series during that period that were followed by his scores for YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and the lighter sounding, yet lavish DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER

The scores for these four James Bond films, are richly textured, meticulously scored for each required scene and are emotionally charged


Perhaps Sean Connery gave his definitive performance as James Bond in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE
In GOLDFINGER Sean Connery added more cynicism and humor to the role giving the character, this film, and the entire series a new dimension


That humor somehow takes a bit of the realistic edge off of the character
With 2006's CASINO ROYALE, a level of realism was added to the series that had never been seen up to then
And so we reflect back on what Sean Connery had established and that is strictly an observation and a retrospective contemplation on my part.Is ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE the definitive Bond film? Perhaps
Take a look at LIVE AND LET DIE and compare the two

Interesting
THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN has become a cult classic over the years

It contains many of the most basic elements that are an integral part of the early James Bond films


THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is one of those rare films where all the talents come together at their peek of perfection delivering an impeccable film
The magic of MOONRAKER is that it contains the best to the worst, or the worst to the best, of all the elements found in the series

There is something in MOONRAKER for everyone


Roger Moore gives a competent performance as 007 but the physical stunts that he is supposedly performing defy credibility in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY

OCTOPUSSY is probably Roger Moore's best Bond movie

The pace is slower and deliberate and the dialogue seems to have more subtle wit interspersed

After Bonds have come and gone through the years A VIEW TO A KILL somehow still entertains more with each passing year and for me it sort of rounded out the classic years of the Bond films that started with DR
NO
It ended one era on I suppose a happy carefree note.The first thing that struck me about this film is that Timothy Dalton could act and he took the part very seriously


I found THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS to be one of the better James Bond films


LICENCE TO KILL is an interesting and progressive follow-up to Timothy Dalton's version of a world weary James Bond in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS.GOLDENEYE, Pierce Brosnan's first Bond film, is an interesting one
Most noticeable was its score
Eric Serra's score to GOLDENEYE is highly innovative


It is powerful, sensitive and enigmatic
It is a dark score centered on James Bond the man and explores his psyche, his sense for survival and his motivations for getting the job done
Eric Serra's compositions are unlike anything heard in the previous James Bond films of the series
The score still remains highly controversial

James Bond had come up against the Soviets numerous times in the past


In 1995 Soviet Russia was gone


GOLDENEYE was the film that bridged a gap in more ways than one

Infrequently in an action film series does one of its entries attempt to deal with the persona of its hero with equal intensity as it handles its plot as is the case with THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH

The director of this film tried to show how James Bond develops an obsession for a woman for whom he has become intrigued with, her having been mistreated by British Intelligence, and the effect it has on him

Unfortunately this idea never really comes satisfactorily to fruition, as the essential plot elements are not fully explored


They are forsaken at the expense of some unimaginative action sequences and a protracted additional love interest in the form of Dr

Christmas Jones
Pierce Brosnan gets down to business and returns to more familiar territory and storytelling in TOMORROW NEVER DIES


When of the best things to come along in years was composer David Arnold who scored this film


He continued the sound created by John Barry and simultaneously brought the action to a more modern film-making experience
TOMORROW NEVER DIES is one of the best Bond films of the series


DIE ANOTHER DAY is one of the most implausible Bonds, yet it remains entertaining and has some real classic Bond moments
It contains one of David Arnold's best scores


DIE ANOTHER DAY is not all that bad in retrospect
The first hour is classic Bond and it is very good and well written
There is a definite feeling and physical confrontation between Bond and the main villain that has been lacking in many of the Bond films
This film also entertains unlike several before it


It was the 40th Anniversary Bond film when it was released and it contains many references to classic Bond moments that preceded it


DIE ANOTHER DAY can't be all that bad.

$REVIEW.: Man I wish this movie had a budget, it could have really shined. The story is great and most of the acting is on par (sorry, Mrs. Lord of the Lore and a couple minor players).The video quality is reminiscent of an 80s Dr. Who, but then again, those geeks love their Dr. Who, so maybe it was an intentional homage lol.I'm certain some of the scenes were shot without all the actors present, as there is no reason to have such a claustrophobic shot in the same room.Despite its shortcomings, it's a great movie with convincing characters, and the ending scene was awesome (though that voice dub was weak).Hope these guys only get better at what they do, because this is a promising start.

They're the ones who sit at the bar night after night hoping that this time, Mr. Right will walk in and make all their dreams come true.  Hysterical Blindness is a movie about two lifelong friends who are so oblivious to what's really going on around them that they became that clich&eacute;.Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis are consummate actresses.  Perhaps that's why this film was so painful to watch - they both did very well portraying twentysomethings with little self respect. Debbie's (Uma) father left her and her mom when she was 13; her motives for bar slumming are classic, obvious, and sad.  Beth (Juliette) has a daughter whom she leaves at home alone to go bar hopping with Debbie nearly every night. They repeatedly trade their dignity and their sexuality for that very temporary illusion of closeness with a guy (aka, "one night stands").  Neither one of them knows how to not flirt with any eligible male that shows them the slightest interest.As you might expect, this outlook on life leads them into some bleak situations.  Debbie imagines that a guy she meets one night is much more into her than he really is and starts throwing herself at him in a lot of embarrassing stunts to get and keep his attention.  Beth nearly loses her daughter.  There's a very pointed moral to this story about appreciating your friends and loved ones, not looking for something that isn't there and facing reality - all very true in my opinion.What really didn't grab me about Hysterical Blindness was the fact that it was paced so slowly that it seemed to take forever to get around to making its point; meanwhile, I can relate to Debbie all to well on some level, which is a painful thing.  It drags me back to that time in my own life where I was just as insecure in my own way.  Not a nice place to revisit, even if honest.  And I was bored even then.So, if you're really into Uma and Juliette, this is a brilliant showcasing of their talents.  Otherwise, I'd skip Hysterical Blindness in favor of any of the more upbeat chick flicks like 13 Going on 30.Andrea, aka Merribelle

$REVIEW.: I remember summer camp very well, arriving there and hating it instantly,then as the days and weeks go by you get used to it and start to enjoy it. Meatballs is a perfect reflection of this, it's fun and Bill  Murray never lets us down being the true comic genius, he talks to the  campers on their level instead of talking down to them, he is basically a  kid at heart himself. My favorite part was the summer olympics.Who can  forget those at the end of camp? This movie never gets to out of hand, the  scenes of competition are hilarious, the campers, though some are bratty,  make a lot of people identify with them when they were young. I am not  going to even acknowledge the following sequels they made to this film,  Meatballs 2,3 and 4? Whatever, after the first one the rest became just a  bunch of idiotic raunchy sophmoric teen flicks. If you want something a  little more realistic and to just have a good time, this is the one worth  watching.

 Dude!Whatever became of Damn Yankees?  If you're wondering what all the hype was about, it wasn't hype


 DY was the real thang.This video is of a live concert Damn Yankees gave at the Rocky Mountain Jam in Denver


Directed by Larry Jordan, who's also done concert videos for Rush, the live concert film is interspersed with "behind the scenes" footage of this supergroup collaborating on their second album "Don't Tread." Basically, it's a lot of gags with drummer Michael Cartellone busting chops on how old Jack Blades, Tommy Shaw and Ted Nugent are, and the rest of the band's observations on how eccentric wild man Nugent is.Damn Yankees was one supergroup that had great chemistry, so it was a shame that they never put out an album after "Don't Tread." Perhaps it was in the cards: Damn Yankees was the last great hair band to form (yep, they came out after Warrant, though the latter's "Cherry Pie" was officially Heavy Metal's swan song), and the mostly forgetable grunge movement wiped out everything groups like DY had built up.But, hey, don't let the group's unfortunate timing stop you from seeing and hearing this video; DY wails on hit after hit

Jack Blades and, especially, Tommy Shaw shoe they've got the vocal chops to kick rear on power ballads like "Come Again" and "Silence is Broken." But the best are the heavy hitting slammers such as "Damn Yankees," "Don't Tread" and Nugent's paean to the spirit of all things American, the eagle, the vigilante and the American Indian who once rode the Great Plains, "Uprising."This video is one of the best concert films I've seen, and the musicianship of lead guitarist Nugent, the acoustic rhythms of Shaw, the jackhammer bass of Blades and the frenetic drumming of Cartellone really work well in tandem.They save the best for last, doing DY's unique versions of Styx's (Shaw's old band) "Renegade," Night Ranger's (Blade's band) "Rock in America," and -- of course -- Ted's mainstay, "Cat Scratch Fever."Ted being the inimitable Ted, the concert ends with him shooting an arrow right at Saddam Hussein's groin! We need to bring back this great hair band, if only to send a flaming arrow at Osama bin Laden's forehead.

$REVIEW.: A great looking movie which retains it's charm, humor and wry insight after more than half a century. I think many of the gags could have been improved by allowing them to develop a bit longer, but they're still good as is. Undoubtedly influential and I have no doubt that Steve Martin, Rowan Atkinson and Peter Sellers studied Jacques Tati's Hulot. I found it also a bit reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki's gentle family films such asMy Neighbor Totoro.

$REVIEW.: One of the most surprising - okay, shocking - amazing, disturbing, riveting, strangely funny (nervous laughter), and utterly can't-take-my-eyes-off-it movies ever made. A perfect commentary on the hyper-achieving, consumption-centric 1990s, Fight Club puts us on a bullet train from IKEA to anarchy knowing full well that Tyler's lunatics have blown the tracks at some point and we won't get there in one piece.  Fincher does an expert job of unwinding the film style from numb and glassy smooth to all the way crazy, gently ramping up the contrast, introducing bits of grit and jitter until until all you want is a bath and a cup of hot cocoa.  Or Thorazine.  I love this movie and immediately bought a copy.  Odd thing is that I rarely choose to watch it of my own volition. But I'm patently incapable of turning it off or wandering to other channels if it's on.

$review_text.: My nomination for the best British comedy series since 'The Office' and 'Extras' - except that the script writer Graham Lineham is Irish, so it might not count as a purely British show. He also co-wrote 'Father Ted' and 'Black Books', both of them good for a laugh, but The IT Crowd is the funniest of the three.As with 'Black Books', the three main protagonists are a cynical Irishman, a niceguy-nerd, and a slightly dizzy female professional. However, the IT department at the basement of the Reynholm Industries skyscraper is a far cry from Bernard's shop in 'Black Books'.In this first 'IT Crowd' series, the aforementioned female professional Jen is made head of the IT department, the only problem being that she knows nothing about computers. Half the series consists of her trying to get along with the two workers (who eat, sleep and breathe computers), the very weird boss, and the goth in the basement. It might not sound so funny on paper, but the sheer creativity of the script, as well as the strong mannerisms of the actors, breathe life into it.The second series is even funnier than the first, especially episode one 'The Work Outing', which had me in stitches. Other episodes revolve around German cannibals, extra-vibrating phones, film piracy warnings, unfortunate surnames, and spontaneously combusting bras. Not to mention the boss's insanely lecherous son, who arrives to take over the corporation, developing a fixation on Jen, who he describes as a "hoochie-toochie humdinging coochie mama..."The third series is excellent, as Roy and Moss try to be 'real blokes' by learning football-speak; Jen tries to catch out a builder she suspects is urinating in her sink; Douglas is forced to wear 'electric sex pants' that shock him whenever he has arousing thoughts (as part of an out-of-court harassment settlement with Jen after the Rohypnol incident in series two); Roy has to trick Moss and his geek friends to pose for a 'sexy calendar'; and in my favourite episode, Jen's addiction to a social networking site called Friendface ends in disaster.The fourth series isn't quite so laugh-out-loud funny as the second and third, however it definitely still has its moments, with some crazed plots ideas just as inspired as those of previous instalments. Scenarios include Jen hooking up with the zombie-like keyboard player of a rock group; Douglas becoming a 'spaceologist' in a send-up of scientology; Jen pretending she is a skilled interpreter, then having to bluff her way out of it when her instant translation program breaks down; and Douglas trying to divorce his wife and being forced to air his Star Trek-themed homemade sex tapes in court. Come to think of it, most of the best bits in this series seem to involve Douglas or Jen rather than Roy or Moss, although the latter still have some presence by virtue of their unmistakable personalities.'IT Crowd' is required viewing for comedy fans. I haven't laughed so hard in ages.A couple of the actors from this also star in a lesser-known but also very funny British comedy called 'Garth Marengi's Darkplace'.

$review_text.: This is very realistic with Moore's acting being extraordinary

She really seems to actually be Sarah Palin in the movie including the accent she adapted to sound like Sarah Palin.I am not a Sarah Palin fan but Moore's balanced portrayal left me feeling much more sympathy for what Palin and her family went through in her deciding to accept the nomination for Vice President than I had previously felt.While we all know Palin has made a lot of mistakes and has showed her basic ignorance about a lot of issues on national TV, I never really thought about what humiliating herself like that made her feel
Yes, she seems strong as nails and confident in public but in the movie some of this is depicted as bravado and I think that anybody ridiculed the way she was ridiculed had to have some human reactions as a result...e.g

depression, self doubt and anger.I think that, even though I disagree with her political position, I would respect Palin more if she could just admit that she is wrong or misinformed about certain things


The fact that she defends her mistakes in the light of them being blatantly false makes me think she would be dangerous in a powerful position and this movie supports my opinion in this area.As usual Ed Harris gives a great performance but Woody Harrelson gives one of the best performances that I have ever seen him give and that is saying a lot


I hope he won an Emmy like Moore did for this movie.One final thing


When this film came out there was considerable criticism that it was not an accurate account of McCain's choice to make Palin his running mate or a fair portrayal of Sarah Palin.I disagree with that criticism and my stance was formed by many other sources besides the book of the same name on which this movie is based


These sources are not only other books and articles but Palin's own words and actions


Almost everything in this movie that is not a dramatized depiction of the characters in private can be corroborated by other reputable sources and, therefore, I think this movie is very informative as well as very entertainingAnyway, I HIGHLY recommend this movie and bought it for several people...including somebody I know who LOVES Palin...for Christmas and they all liked the movie as much as I did

Truly a &#34;must see.&#34;

The story is simple, the Grinch lives above the Whos, they love Christmas, he hates it, in the end he finally understands what the holiday is all about. In the cartoon you never really find out why he hates, he just does. The movie explains why (although it's somewhat strange). I suppose if you don't compare the movie to anything, it's alright. But you can't help but to compare it to the cartoon. The cartoon showed the Whos as fun loving folk who in the end despite having their material Christmas items stolen from them, still join hands and sing as if nothing ever happened. The meaning of Christmas is not lost on them. In the movie they are given a more human aspect and the mayor points out that they never should have invited the Grinch to an earlier celebration, because he knew this would happen. That part totally ruins the idea that the Whos fully understand the meaning of Christmas. The movie could have been so much better if only they'd stuck to what the book was all about. As for the DVD extras it's got all the bells and whistles you want, even some Who recipes!

$REVIEW.: This film is absolutely gorgeous from beginning to end. The "beginning of time" montage that starts the film is beautiful; roaming shots of the Icelandic countryside and angry waterfalls wash over you as the score tries to soothe you in a way that feels like it's trying to mislead you. It's as if it's trying to say, "There there, it'll be alright," and pats you softly on the hand like a caring grandmother before turning around in the next scene and growing to its peak as something horrific takes place on screen that wasn't expected mere moments ago.Everything is awe-inspiring to look at. One of the reasons for that is that Scott tried to use as little CGI in the film as possible (although there are over 1300 digital VFX shots) and mostly stuck to computer generated shots being used in space. If you're not blown away by the scenery, their exploration of the planet's surface and what that leads to, or the incredible shots in space, the technology they use in the film is beyond astounding; Reacting with holograms, 3D maps that can be accessed with the swipe of a finger, and an android capable of doing things some people only dream of is only scratching the surface.Where do we come from? Who are our makers? Will we still trust our faith when we find the answers? These are the questions "Prometheus" explores in its story. You also have a pretty great idea of just what the heck a Space Jockey is by the time "Prometheus" ends. The thing is that if you go into this expecting a straight shooting "Alien" prequel, you'll more than likely be disappointed. There are definitely nods to it and parts of the film play out similarly to "Alien," but this is more like taking place in the same universe as "Alien" and more of an indirect prequel. That quote Ridley Scott gave about this "having 'Alien' DNA," is extremely accurate."Prometheus" isn't perfect. It may be really slow moving for some. It takes its sweet time establishing its atmosphere and you may be left wanting a bit more action. Patient viewers who can sit still and admire dialogue and a solid story will be rewarded while trigger happy viewers will more than likely get antsy. The ending, although somewhat satisfying, is mostly just this huge tease. If a sequel isn't made, we should probably riot; although, with repeat viewings, it's less of a problem.The biggest issue people may have is that technology seems so much more advanced in the past than in the future. "Prometheus" mostly takes place in 2093 while "Alien" takes place in 2122. You also have to keep in mind that the Prometheus is a more advanced ship than the Nostromo, a towing vessel; more of a grunt ship. So the argument could go either way.Repeat viewings also leave you with more questions. The main one being why did the atmosphere have such an altering affect on the ampule room yet didn't affect the cargo hold at all?"Prometheus" is really freaking superb on one hand. Its cast is ridiculous and every one of them delivers, the visuals are fantastic, and the storyline is mostly incredibly enthralling. Imagine being a film critic who's used to taking notes throughout the duration of a film, but during "Prometheus" you were so absorbed in it that you didn't write anything down other than the title. That's kind of a big deal.On the other hand, something more definitive seems like it would have been more gratifying. With stakes so high that define what we, as humans, actually are, an open ending leaving room for a sequel feels like a bit of a cop out. "Prometheus" is still spectacular and mesmerizing. Ridley Scott is back in top form, but "Prometheus" suffers from pulling (and relying on) the strings of anticipation a bit too much.

$review_text.: JOHNNY CASH--RIDIN' THE RAILS: THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAIN STORY is almost excellent! It is a fun history lesson taught by Johnny Cash, about the history of trains in America


It is marred only by jittery, motion-sickness inducing, hand held camera work which seems to take up about 25% of the running time, sprinkled throughout.Johnny grew up around train tracks, and tells how his dad would ride the trains like a hobo, looking for work, and such


They also re-enact many of the historical scenes that Johnny teaches about, tracing many milestones in the history of trains and their influence on the shaping of the USA.It is a very enjoyable program, if you like trains, or like seeing Johnny Cash talk about this somewhat obscure topic which he truly loves to talk about.The DVD extras are just outtakes of a few of the scenes, but they add about 15 minutes, or so

The main program is about 50 minutes.My dad is 73 years old

He LOVES trains, and he likes Johnny Cash

I was afraid that he would balk at the shaky camera work, (he won't put up with ANYTHING if he doesn't want to), but he was very engrossed by the historical aspects, tolerated the obscure train songs sung by Johnny, and announced how GOOD the DVD was, after we watched it together!If you are like me, and you already own most of Johnny Cash's live music DVDs, then you will likely enjoy this RIDIN' THE RAILS on DVD


If you are new to Johnny Cash, then I would recommend getting one of his live concert DVDs before this one


LIVE IN IRELAND or LIVE IN DENMARK are my favorites, but most any of his LIVE DVDs are great! The weakest one is BEHIND PRISON WALLS, which is only half including Johnny Cash, and the guest musicians are not personal friends of Johnny's, as they are on most of his LIVE concert DVDs.

$REVIEW.: Of the Ryan movies I've seen, this easily qualifies as the best of the bunch. Baldwin's Ryan is vunerable yet capable and yet approachable and likable and the situation he's thrust into is easy to get into unlike the sequels. With a cast like Sean connery and Sam Neil and Scott Glenn, this is A+ material all the way through a tension filled ocean!

$review_text.: RKO Radio Pictures presents "PRIMROSE PATH" (1940) (93 min/B&W;) -- Starring: Ginger Rogers, Joel McCrea, Marjorie Rambeau, Henry Travers, Miles Mander, Queenie Vassar, Joan Carroll, Vivienne Osborne, Carmen MoralesDirected by Gregory La CavaGinger Rogers and Joel McCrea did some of their best work in this film. The screenplay is a great one, and the direction is right on.Joel McCrea's part is pretty typical but Ginger Rogers gets some tremendous lines and the supporting cast is surprisingly strong.Ginger gives a great performance in Primrose Path, a good lead into what would be her Oscar winner with Kitty Foyle that same year.Ellie May Adams (Ginger Rogers) lives on Primrose Hill with her good-hearted and fancy free mother, her drunken father, her younger sister and a mean-spirited grandmother. The Hill is not a good part of town, however. When she meets and falls for a hard-working man (Joel McCrea), they marry and she hides her past from him. When he discovers the truth it jeopardizes their marriageThe word "prostitute" is never mentioned (it would have given the 1940 censors apoplexy), but it was obvious anyway. Still, the film was banned in Detroit, and the play was modified to placate those censors. Queenie Vassar was primarily a stage actress; this was her first film.Oscar Nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Marjorie Rambeau)BIOS:1.

$review_text.: It's a dangerous thing to expose the ending of an incredibly important television show before the rest of the world gets to see it; how would you like it if someone told you who won American Idol before the first round even airs?  But now that I've seen the epic conclusion to LOST, well, I have no choice but to reveal the ending.  Why?  Because your lives depend on it.So I'm sure you've seen what's been aired so far.  Not-Locke ("Smocke") is plotting his escape from the island and our beloved characters are choosing sides.  A bizarre alternate reality shows Ben as a teacher and Hurley with a tremendous dose of good luck.  Viewers are speculating whether these "flash-sideways" will somehow converge with the island reality, causing the characters to make even bigger decisions about how their lives should progress.  But what you the viewer should be considering instead is, what does YOUR existence mean?For this is not fantasy my friends.  Oh, no; soon YOU will be making the decision of what dimension you want to exist in.  Damon and Carlton have said all along that they've known what the final scene of LOST would look like since they started the show.  Now I know why.  They've become privy to information that, if revealed to the public at large instead of just these two talented writers, would have torn the world apart with fear and anxiety.  LOST was created to prepare us for the real 'incident' that will occur just after the final episode airs in May.On May 23rd, at 11:42p.m. (23:42 military time), a massive electromagnetic burst will hit planet Earth.  When it does, time will split into at least three separate timelines.  Depending on what you're doing at that exact moment, you will be thrust into one of these dimensions.  In one, every material object you ever wanted can be yours but you will no longer be able to love.  In another, you will be with your true love but your moral compass will be askew and you'll find yourself riddled with guilt.  And in the third, all free will must be given up but you will be guaranteed a life filled with peace.  It will be your choice.If I were you, I'd pre-order the DVD box set before the incident. That way, you'll probably be able to take it with you regardless of the dimension you end up in.  We all need a constant.

$REVIEW.: This film does to Shakespeare's Julius Ceasar what Zeferelli does to Romeo and Juilet; it makes this movie the indisputable version for the play. It's an MGM black and white production directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Louis Calhern plays Julius Ceasar, Marlon Brando plays loyal Marc Antony, and James Mason plays the noble, but misled Brutus. As usual, movies may not be able to show 100% of the original play, but what you see on the screen is a faithful rendition of the play. The audience will notice that the scenes do not share the realistic backgrounds that they might see in films such as The Robe, Ben-Hur, or Spartacus, or in other Shakespeare plays done by Hollywood. Each scene has a theatrical touch to it, whether the scene involves a few speakers or large crowds, and makes no limitations to presenting a riot scene or battle scenes. It's unnecessary to say that Calhern, Brando, and Mason deliver excellent performances. A reminder that this is faithfully based on the play and not belonging to the sword and sandal genre that became popular during the fifties.

$review_text.: "The Heart of Me" is pure, unadulterated soap opera redeemed by the kind of high-toned, stiff-upper-lip seriousness of which the British seem uniquely capable
 Set primarily in the 1930's, the film tells the story of two sisters caught in a passionate and quasi-incestuous love triangle
 Madeline (Olivia Williams), the older of the two, is an uptight woman whose weak-willed husband, Rickie (Paul Bettany), falls in love with her younger and more free-spirited sibling, Dinah (Helena Bonham Carter)
 These two in-laws, soul mates for life, carry on a torrid love affair until Madeline discovers the truth - and even for a time thereafter.Given the material, "The Heart of Me" could easily have devolved into a cheap, sensationalistic melodrama for the "Masterpiece Theatre" set

 Instead, thanks to truly brilliant performances by the three principal actors and an intelligent, thoughtful screenplay, the film becomes a wholly absorbing drama that offers profound insights into the realities of the human heart

 The pain each of these people experiences is so palpable in its intensity that it washes away all traces of artificiality and contrivance


 The film becomes a fascinating study of what happens when clanging passions are hemmed in by the restrictions and proprieties of a strict, morally repressive upper class society


 Rickie and Dinah choose to turn themselves into social pariahs, then must face the consequences of their convention-defying actions

 Of most interest is the emotionally complex relationship between the two very different sisters
 What makes the film special is the way in which it allows the seemingly cold-hearted Madeline to become as much a sympathetic figure as the two impassioned lovers

 Thanks to Williams' impeccable performance (she played Penelope in the TV movie version of "The Odyssey"), Madeline is allowed to live and breathe and have her own say, making her, in many ways, the most intriguing of the three main characters."The Heart of Me," which is beautifully detailed in costumes and settings, transcends the limits of its genre to deliver a heartbreaking tale of love, loss, lament - and hope.

$REVIEW.: I remember watching this show on Toonami on Cartoon Network during the school week and let me tell you, I was ecstatic to see it released on DVD. Folks, you will not want to miss this anime. It has a perfect blend of comedy, lots of action, a little drama and a good amount of blood. You can scroll up to read the plot and tell you what it is about because I wont tell you what its about like so many other reviews. But I will tell you that this show has always had a special place in my heart and it is a show that you could watch over and over and never get bored. Some of the character voices are alittle rough and kinda annoying, but you will get used to them. I strongly recommend this series. The only thing I will say to stay away from is the Movie. There is a Yu Yu Hakusho movie out, do not buy it. All of the voices are completely, I mean completely different. If that doesnt bother you than go for it, but my opinion is to stay away. Or you could watch on Youtube and see how bad it is and then save or money. But as far as the anime series goes, its worth every penny :)

$REVIEW.: The scenery is gorgeous, most of the acting fine, the music lovely, and the language, after all, belongs to Will Shakespeare. Unfortunately, this production suffers from K. Brannagh's editing. He cut out a lot of the play's funniest lines. Some would also argue that he darkened the plot inappropriately.Despite all that, I think it's one of the best of the recent Shakespeare movies. Brannagh and Thompson are great as two of Will's smartest lovers.

$review_text.: Yikes!  This movie is a real stinker.  The  script is unbelievably bad - cliche-ridden and just generally awkward and uninspired and bland - no one talks in real life like these people do. The noteworthy thing about "Here On Earth" is the number of good actors trapped in it.  Two of the leads, Leelee Sobieski and especially Josh Hartnett, do the best they can, but their characters are unsympathetic (yes, even Hartnett's character, who's sweet but basically not very bright); however as the third member of the love triangle, and ostensibly the "hero" of the story, Chris Klein does not remotely possess either the acting skills or the good looks required to pull off his role of a spoiled preppie.  Just the first five minutes of the movie reveal what a bad actor he is here, and if you can make it past that, the scene of him watching his college graduation from afar, while reciting the boring valedictory speech (complete with a Robert Frost quote!) he was supposed to give, will have you laughing out loud at the utter lameness of it (of course this is when Leelee first starts to fall for him - yeah, right...).  On the other hand, the scene of Leelee dancing around the kitchen while making breakfast for her "new true love" will have you running for your barf bag.  On the up side, at least it's nice to see actors like Bruce Greenwood, Annette O'Toole and Michael Rooker, but they are completely wasted in this movie, although what little they have to do they do very well.  The three main characters are written so simplistically, they just wind up seeming self-centered, stupid, and totally unworthy of the viewers' interest.  The faux-"Footloose" score is also annoying.  I would highly recommend NOT buying this movie - it's resemblance to real life is nonexistent, which is ironic given the title.  If there was a "no stars" rating, that's what I would give it.

Maybe we better clean up our act in USA before we throw stones at another country.  Great acting, good writing, sometimes a little slow, definitely not for little children - but a good history lesson for teens and older.  This is not a good feeling film - you will be angry and depressed at the end.  But definitely worth watching.

$review_text.: Some movies just don't sound all that appealing from the moment you hear about them. Case in point, Disney's newest film "Underdog" based on the classic cartoon series about a crime fighting super dog. The premise is stupid, just as it was on the cartoon, but the cartoon still managed to entertain audiences in its day and it still does with reruns whenever they air. But when I heard that Disney was making a live-action adaptation of the cartoon, I thought this is going to be a really stupid, most likely crappy movie. But then I saw a preview for the movie, and my opinion changed, the preview showed that the movie had decent acting talents Jim Belushi, Peter Dinklage, Patrick Warburton, and Jason Lee; the film also seemed to be full of humor, with a little bit of slapstick thrown in for good measure (a must when adapting a cartoon); and it seemed that the movie actually had good special effects for making a flying, talking, superhero dog believable. So, I went from not caring if I ever saw the movie, to actually looking forward to getting to sit down to watch it."Underdog" is the story of an ordinary beagle named Shoeshine (voiced by Jason Lee) who through a series of unforeseen accidents; finds himself in a lab operated by a mad scientist named Dr. Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). When Barsinister tries to experiment on Shoeshine, the dog breaks free causing a devastating accident in the lab, and he is exposed to an experimental chemical that leaves him with super powers such as flight, strength and the ability to talk. After breaking free of the lab, Shoeshine finds himself a new home with a security guard (Jim Belushi) and his son, where he determines that his newfound powers can be used to save the citizens of Capital City from evil as the crime fighter, Underdog. However, when Barsinister, along with his henchman Cad (Patrick Warburton), discovers that this new hero, Underdog, is actually their escaped beagle, they will stop at nothing until the dog is returned to them, leaving the fates of those Shoeshine/Underdog cares for hanging in the balance. Now, all that remains is for us to hear those famous heroic words, "This looks like a job for Superm...err, umm... oops, wrong movie, here's what I meant, "There's no need to fear, Underdog is here!".Well, here's the lesson that I learned from watching Disney's new film, "Underdog". Sometimes it's better to go with your initial gut instinct, instead of letting your mind be changed by smart marketing types who know how to properly edit batches of film together to make a fun, entertaining trailer that will get your attention and make you want to see the film, even though your better judgment is telling you that there's no reason at all that you should even be tempted to watch it.The problems I had with "Underdog" are not major, but they are big enough gripes to take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. The story isn't anything spectacular by any means; I mean it is supposed to be a kids movie that is adapted from a classic kids cartoon. When a studio sets out to make a kids movie, which is something that Disney does quite often (though to varying degrees of success as of late), then the filmmaker(s) and the writer(s) should feel some obligation to entertain the parents on some level, not the entire time necessarily, but at least a little bit. Especially, when the subject matter is taken from a classic cartoon series that some of these parents most likely watched and loved as kids, therefore I think there should at least be some kind of joke or sight gag or something that adults would get and enjoy as well. Now, I'm not saying there needs to be some kind of raunchy humor, by no means is that what I'm implying, you still keep the family-friendly tone, but there are ways to inject humor aimed more at adults without getting dirty, `Looney Toons' used to do it all the time in their animated shorts, so why can't the current crop of creative types come up with anything?The casting choices for this film were good, for the most part; some of the more talented members of the cast seemed wasted in their roles. Jim Belushi and Patrick Warburton are two very funny actors (in my opinion), but in this film neither funnyman is given much to do. Jim Belushi has had great success with his hit sitcom "According to Jim" on ABC, and with various movie projects throughout the years, but in this film it seemed like they didn't want him to be funny, which is fine he's done drama as well, and he's good at it, but his material is just so paper thin that I'm surprised he even signed on to the film. I mean, his character basically exists as a plot device to get the dog, Shoeshine, into a loving home, setting up for the obligatory shenanigans around the home that have been done to death in other movies, except here they can take things a little more extreme due to the whole super powered dog trick. Now, Disney has used Patrick Warburton in at least one of their previous films the hit animated movie "The Emperor's New Groove", he was the hilarious not-so evil, evil sidekick Kronk, who essentially stole the show, even got his own sequel "Kronk's New Groove". In this film, just like Jim Belushi, Patrick's character seems like a waste of time, he's given a few funny lines to say, but other than that he pretty much just stands around with nothing to do. With two solid comedic actors in such thankless roles, it makes me wonder was the script much funnier before filming or editing took place or were the paychecks just too good to resist? Actor Jason Lee (better known as Earl on TV's "My Name is Earl") was decent as the voice of Shoeshine/Underdog, he gave the character a likeable charm and sharp wit, but truth be told, any other actor could have done just as good, it's not like he has crafted a character that people will only remember his voice associated with. Peter Dinklage was good as the evil Dr. Barsinister, he seemed to be enjoying the role and being allowed to ham it up, but after awhile even his character seemed to have less and less to do. The younger actors (the one playing Jim Belushi's son and his would-be girlfriend) were alright, but both seemed inexperienced, and their performances felt stiff because of this.The special effects employed in this film were all very well done. I was surprised that for a kids movie that was adapted from a cartoon that the effects looked much more realistic than cartoonish. The flying scenes in particular were really well done, especially the sequence where Underdog is squaring off against three other super powered dogs working for the evil Barsinister. Basically, the effects are the only real highlight for this film, at least from an adult's perspective; kids will no doubt be entertained throughout the entire duration of the movie.Overall, "Underdog" is an average movie, that's aimed solely at kids with little to no humor that ever manages to get above the level of cute. So, you parents out there who may believe that the movie looked good based on the previews (in case your curious this is a case where most of the funny parts are in the previews) and your fond memories of the cartoon series, don't expect too much from the end result. You will most likely wind up just as disappointed as I was, but at least your kids will be happy, so at least you'll have that."Underdog" is rated PG for mild violence.

$review_text.: Kiddy Grade is an anime with epic amibitions and has space opera written all over it. If you like lots of action, intelligence, suspense, science fiction, intrigue, and great characters then you will definately want to check this series out.In the science fiction world of Kiddy Grade the planets of the galaxy have joined together into the Global Union. To mediate between these disparate cultures and worlds, an organization called G.O.T.T. (Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs) is formed at the same time. While it mostly is involved in economic disputes it also has ES members who carry out covert missions of all types, not all of which would be considered legal. The two main characters of Kiddy Grade are the ES members Eclair and Lumiere. Yes, let me just warn you, this series has goofy names that even Charles Dickens wouldn't come up with.Eclair and Lumiere are not just normal ladies. All ES memebers have special abilities, what we in America would call super-powers. Eclair has superstrength and is close to invulnerable to most weapons but in terms of morality, she's a sixteen year old. I don't think she recognizes evil as such and sees her job as a type of adventure, as evidenced when she boards a hostile ship and bashes down the door to the bridge andsays she's just delivering pizza. She can also use her tube of lipstick which can also double as a whiplike energy weapon.Lumiere, on the other hand is the picture of elegance and  looks like an elementary age girl but behind that appearance she has the power to control machines with her thoughts. She can also hack into computers with just her mind and take them over. It comes in handy when you're surrounded by an enemy fleet and she hacks into their computers and makes them destroy each other. She also has an affinity for drinking wine and champagne and then using the bottles as bombs.While all this might seem a tad over the top, it's not. This dvd was great. In the first episode, Depth/Space, Eclair and Lumiere are instructed to escort a man named Armblast to the planet of Medeia. There he will try to settle a dispute between that world and another, Planet Faunus. Armblast seems to have a history with Eclair and she never seems to trust him. It seems that Armblast has his own private agenda and has been known to make shady deals in the past. The other problem is that certain elements on both planets would rather have war than peace and will try to stop the their peace mission from arriving.The second episode, Tight/Bind, involves a lost shipment of Hi-G, a gravitational element that could be used to benefit humanity but could also be used to create deadly weapons. Two other women ES agents are sent along with Eclair and Lumiere, Alv and Dverger. There is no love lost between them and our main characters. In fact, if they were killed in action, it probably wouldn't bother Alv and Dverger at all. They travel to a prison satellite to question the inmates who had originally tried to smuggle the Hi-G.Prisoner/Escort is the last episode on the dvd. Eclair and Lumiere have captured the notorious crimnal Drake Han, a man who wears a bulky mechanical apparatus for life support. Now they have to escort him to the proper authorities so he can be put on trial. They can't even put him on their normal ship because he won't fit. So instead they have to take a more public mode of transportation. They have a police escort, whose chief officer seems to especially dislike Eclair. In addition there are those who will try to free their prisoner because Drake has paid good money over the years to a sorta criminal insurance fund. If you pay into this fund, you are guaranteed to be broken out of prison if you ever get arrested.This first volume of Kiddy Grade is mostly just an introduction to the settings and characters of the series. It had some cheapskate scenes where instead of showing the action, they just show a person's reaction. I guess they didn't want to spend the money on that. Trust me, there is plenty of explicit and visible action in later volumes. The music is great, composed mostly of orchestral movements interspersed with more pop-like group music. You get the sense that there is a lot of depth here that is just barely being hinted at in this first volume. For instance, what is the real motivation for G.O.T.T and the Global Union. You sense that there are immoral choices being made behind the scenes. Eclair and Lumiere seem to be like the Jedi Knights in the Star Wars prequels. I mean in the sense that they are trying to do their job honestly the best they can within a corrupt system. I highly recommend this series. At the time of this writing, there are 4 volumes out, with the 5th soon to be.In addition to this series, I would also recommend the animes Last Exile, and also Full Metal Panic.

I can't believe that SHOUT Factory didn't take the time to clean up the source tapes more before releasing this set. While I am glad to have the Room 222 series being released on DVD, I hope they will give us better quality prints on future season releases. Comparitively, Shout Factory's That Girl is spectacular and that show was shot on film as well as Room 222. I hope that if SHOUT Factory remasters this first season they will offer a swap out to those of us who already purchased the poor quality copies.

$review_text.: There was a time when there were some terrible and very graphics films filled with violence and gore, "Caligula" and "Salo" come quickly to mind. Most people were disgusted with these films, but at least, there was substance behind. Pasolini made "Salo" because of some really profound ideas he had, whatever the film ended up being.This film is almost iconic of present times. There is no sense of any idea behind the film, except maybe the one people praise so much among these reviews, and those being: 1) an homage to old gore films; 2) the "audacity" of being so graphic; 3) that Rob Zombie doesn't give a f@@k about anything, he's just having fun.Not only is this film devoid of any idea or substance, there is no story, no characters, no director and not even a cinephile. There is not even tension since by half the movie you know that there is no way someone will end up alive.This is a film for teenagers I guess, but sadly, just another milestone of braindead entertainment.

$REVIEW.: This is a moody film based upon a Japanese film of the same name
Hideo Nakata was responsible for 'Ringu' which was also made into a US horror movie


Walter Salles directs the Dark Water remake for American audiences which features a great cast


While neither version of Dark Water is precisely a horror film (they are really dark, dramatic thrillers) the film is still worth watching.Although there was a PG-13 and unrated version of this film we get the 105-minute theatrical cut in this release

The picture and audio quality are above average

We get some extras (Analyzing 'Dark Water's Sequences and two deleted scenes) but three featurettes from the DVD release are absent

$REVIEW.: I just listened to the CD and was pleased.  This CD/DVD is not a release of new songs -- rather a collection of material previously recorded.  Whether this is truly the "essential" Celtic Woman is an individual choice.  I would have come up with a different grouping, but that's okay.  I "think" I detected Lynn Hillary's voice on one or two songs, but I could be mistaken.  Lisa (the backbone of the group) is there, and so is Meav, which surprised me a bit -- since a couple of the songs sound like fresh recordings (although of the same tunes).  I am anxious for Lynn Hillary to be given the spotlight sometime in the future, as she has an outstanding voice.  Since she is also a songwriter, I'm hoping Celtic Woman will let her take the spotlight at their next recording session or taped live spot.  Check out her "Take Me With You" CD (not easy to find) and listen to it a few times then make your own judgment.  I think she's a natural for this group as long as they let her talents be heard.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed this new James Bond movie a lot more than I thought I would. Lots of action and special effects coupled with a nice storyline made this a good James Bond film.I am not sure that I am completely sold on Daniel Craig as the new "James Bond".... he seems to be a good actor, however unlike many of his predecessors, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan, Craig lacks the suaveness & sex appeal his predecessors gave the "James Bond" character. Craig brings a tougher, colder James Bond to the screen for the most part.Also, the storyline was a bit predictable as I had figured out that Vesper Lynd was going to be a traitor in this movie long before hand, which makes it disappointing when one can figure out the storyline in advance.

$review_text.: For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie.

$REVIEW.: This was the reason I bought a DVD player (well, that and the extended versions of the Lord of the Rings films, but I digress). Rush In Rio is an excellent snapshot of Canada's most (in)famous rock outfit. They sound fresher than they have in years and seem to be having more fun than ever as well; a lot of that probably stems from the fact that this trio -- and drummer Neil Peart in particular -- managed to survive a traumatic experience in the life of Peart, coming through that storm with a renewed sense of self and energy to fuel it all.Musically, the band sound as good as ever. Vocally, bassist Geddy Lee has a tough time on some of the older material (notorious for its high-end heavy metal wails) but still manages to make it all work. Peart is simply amazing on drums and guitarist Alex Lifeson prances and laughs (and rants!) his way through an intense set of the band's best -- Tom Sawyer, New World Man, Limelight, 2112, Closer To the Heart ... they are all here.The bonus disc is good for fans, featuring a nice documentary. Also (hidden and difficult to find -- ARGH!) fun to see is the 1975 video for Anthem.All in all, this disc is a worthy representation of one of the top live bands ever.

$REVIEW.: Here's another film from the 1980s that has reached "classic" status. Unlike some of the other popular movies of its day, this one had two sequels that both were successful, particularly the second. As I write this, there's a fourth Terminator just out on the silver screen.In retrospect, what makes this "Terminator" different is that Arnold Schwarzenegger was the villain, not the hero, as he was in the next two Terminator movies.Here, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton are the "good guys." The now famous phrase by Arnold, "I'll be back." comes from this film. Hamilton, meanwhile, also was different, with a shapely figure and a fairly nice person, unlike the ultra-thin and coarse woman she was in the first sequel.Played mostly for violence and special effects, the film is a bit rough and sleazy in parts but certainly was popular because, like most of Arnold's film, it flat-out entertains.I've been debating about buying the Blu-Ray but have held off because of conflicting reviews on it, most of them being negative about the transfer.

$review_text.: some might not like this mix of teen-comedy/sci-fi/time travel/slasher film, and not just for it's thematic ADD.  It has a knowing cheesiness and self aware hipness that can be off-putting, but I loved the rapid fire dialog.  It is so full of cultural reference and double meaning that it required two viewings back to back.  You might need that also to follow the plot, if not just to see that certain threads were actually included right from the beginning and not just thrown in half way through to make things weird.  The movie kind of felt like Heathers on crack.  Shanley Caswell and Josh Hutcherson were spot on the entire film in their portrayal of indignant outsider and laid back cool guy (respectively).  My guess is that this is a love it or hate it film, but it is definitely worth a viewing, and if you do watch it - stick with it, it all does come together at the end ... even if you have to watch it again to follow just how. :P

$REVIEW.: Having not read all of the previous reviews of this excellent King adaptation, I must add to the accolades by singling out one of the film's supporting performers, one who has been a presence for over a half century: Dabbs Greer.  Although only seen as the &quot;old Paul Edgecomb,&quot; Greer makes a memorable turn as the elder version of Tom Hanks in the movie's closing moments.  His quiet and dignified soliloquy is truly touching.  I cannot tell how moved I was by such a topper to this outstanding bit of storytelling.  Greer, as well as all parties involved, magnificently brought one of Stephen King's best works to the screen.  Along with &quot;The Shawshank Redemption,&quot; &quot;Mile&quot; ranks as the most faithful and cinematically satisfying of any jump from page to the cinema.

$review_text.: Winter's Bone is, hands down, the best film of 2010. The main character, Ree Dolly, has more burdens to bear than most fifty year olds and she is only 17.  She is single-handedly raising her younger brother and sister because her mother is mentally ill and her father, who has recently been busted for cooking meth, has disappeared. To top all of this, Ree finds out that her father has put up their house and land as his bond.  She has one week to find him or risk losing the little her family has. Ree's journey to find her father takes her through the dangerous,inbred, meth-laden culture of the Ozarks. I don't want to give too much of the film away but suffice it to say, that you will be totally immersed in this film within its first few minutes and you will still be thinking about it days later. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as Ree. She should win the Oscar. The director has done an incredible job of bringing the Ozark drug culture to life. While some reviewers have questioned the realty of how this culture is portrayed, I do not.  I'm from the deep south (on the Appalachian side) and unfortunately it rings all too true to me. Regardless, this is a movie that you don't want to miss.

$review_text.: During World War II, German scientists performed top-secret experiments in the paranormal and worked at creating an invincible super soldier. They succeeded on creating a squad of soldiers who were neither living, nor dead. Allied troops later spoke of battling with this elite SS unit, known as the Death Corps, who fought without weapons and killed with their bare hands. The allies never captured a single member of this SS unit.Two couples looking for some leisure time on the ocean take a dive boat out for some relaxation. The boat's captain (John Carradine) and first mate (Luke Halpin) expertly manage to shipwreck the boat near a remote island. Upon finding the home of a self-exiled Nazi commander (Peter Cushing) they all learn of the story of the undead super soldiers and what became of them. And unfortunately for the living, the troops are ready for service once again.Ken Widerhorn's direction was passable, but ultimately, I think it's the acting that keeps this ship afloat. No, they're not spectacular performances, but overall they're pretty good. As it should be expected, veteran actors Carradine (The Astro-Zombies) and Cushing (Star Wars) are the standouts, though I don't think it's on either one of their best roles lists. Brooke Adams (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and Halpin (Flipper) put in some honest work while the rest of the main cast are fairly forgettable. Though don't discount the eight actors playing zombies. They did a yeoman's job and seemed to take their roles very seriously, adding a lot of believability to the film. That's saying a lot since they were cast from an ad put in the paper down on location in Florida.These Nazi zombies look good for being some thirty plus years old. By that I mean they're not very decomposed. To their credit, they are on the pasty side and they're pretty wrinkled. You know how you get when you're in the bubble bath, er...shower too long? Sorta like that. They're still fairly creepy, though. Since we don't know how exactly these guys were created, you could explain away the decomposition by some kind of anti-aging zombification serum. What's more impressive is that their uniforms don't look decayed at all. You can rationalize the zombies, but not the uniforms I'm afraid.SHOCK WAVES is the first film for director Ken Wiederhorn. Likewise, it's the first film for all the credited screenwriters as well as the producer. Many of the film's flaws can be attributed to the lack of experience, but even with its flaws, Shock Waves is very watchable and managed to attain a cult following over the years. I think there are a few reasons why.First of all, it manages to escape what most zombie movies can't...simply being a crappy movie. If you can at least be an average zombie film, with the glut of all the really bad ones, you're destined to stick out among the crowd. Secondly, it's a rather unique take on the undead. Only ZOMBIE LAKE really comes close to the premise of underwater Nazi zombies, and SHOCK WAVES is head and shoulders above that dried-up piece of dead wood. Thirdly, there are a few very memorable scenes that will stick in your mind. For me, the best was the scene where all the undead Nazis rise up out of the water one by one and slowly head to shore. And lastly, you have the mere presence of John Carradine and Peter Cushing. Between the two, I think they've been in about a billion films and have both accumulated their own legions of fans throughout their career. Put it all together and you've got a flick that will continue to add to its following for quite some time to come.

$REVIEW.: "The Croods" is one of those rare family films that is actually about a family.  Like so many of these animated flicks, the plot is supposedly about slapstick humor but is actually about the erosion of father figure Grug's (Nicolas Cage) authority as leader of the family unit.  Throw in a burgeoning romance between his eldest daughter Eep (Emma Stone) with stranger Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and you have...well you have the exact same plot of "Hotel Transylvania." Only better.In the world of the Neanderthal, the Croods have to work hard to stay alive, a fact the film never shies away from.  A thrilling hunt sequence concludes with barely enough food to feed wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), baby Sandy (Randy Thom), son Thunk (Clark Duke) and arch-nemesis/mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman). Their brutal world involves spending most of the day hunting for eggs in the desert, and then cowering in a heap in a cave at night. In case it's not clear, "The Croods" demonstrates that Grug's over-protectiveness is well-earned by throwing, get this, a bearowl at the family over and over.  This is probably the closest gamers are ever going to see the Dungeons & Dragons equivalent of an owlbear on screen.The true threat turns out to be both physical and existential: first in the inevitable separation of Pangea and then the arrival of a boy.  That boy happens to be homo sapien Guy and his pet sloth, Belt (Chris Sanders).  Guy has lots of interesting ideas like fire, puppets, and an apocalyptic vision that piques cute redhead Neanderthal Eep's interest in him.  You can guess where this is going, right?When the apocalypse destroys the cavemen's cave, the family is forced into a land lush with vegetation, animals, food - and predators.  Lots and lots of predators. Where and when the Croods live is undefined, but it's a lot like "Avatar: The Last Airbender" in that fauna is a mix of two or more animals: mousephants, piranhakeets, liyotes, jackrobats...you get the idea.  Grug discovers that his usual fight or flight tactics are not enough in this strange new world.  It will require flexibility, courage, and no small amount of imagination to reach their new home.Along the way, "The Croods" isn't afraid to make fun of family dynamics. Grug routinely trains Thunk to take the lead in the hunt even though it's obvious Eep is the superior of just about every character on screen, including the physically weaker object of her affection, Guy.  Much of Grug's motivation is determined by the possibility that elderly Gran will finally kick the bucket. And Eep must learn how to separate herself from her family without losing her identity.  It's heavy stuff for a kid's film.Most of the time the film rumbles along at a breakneck pace, careening from natural disasters to bizarre animals and back again.  But then there's a lot of talk about feelings, Grug threatens Guy, and Guy comes up with a solution involving genre-stretching puppets.  This happens not once, but twice, and during those talky moments my son fidgeted in his seat.But then more explosions happen, the family rallies, and Belt shouts his trademark, "Dun, dun, DUNNNN!" Kids were repeating it in the audience, so mission accomplished.  Although it's not always a smooth ride, any film where the female protagonist is smarter, stronger, and more creative than her male counterparts is a great evolutionary step forward.

McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is nervous watching Hirk through his high-tech binoculars.  Spock (Leonard Nimoy) propels in his jet boots to Kirk to help him understand his dangerous situation.  Suddenly Kirk falls and like Superman, Spock saves Kirk from a deadly fate.On Nimbus 3, their is an evangelist/metaphysical Vulcan, "Sybok" (Laurence Luckinbill), who is Spock's half-brother, has befriended a new believer.  Meanwhile, Scotty, (James Doohan) is upset trying to get the new NCC 1701-A Enterprise to work in tip-top condition.  Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) offers Scotty some dinner.  Suddenly, tyhe Enterprise receives an emergency call "red alert, priority 7" from Starfleet.  All shore leave officers are summoned to beam up, however Chekov (Walter Koenig) and Sulu (George Takei) are lost.  leave it to Uhura to find everyone.When Kirk and Spock make it down to Nimbus 3, they are met by caithlin Dar (Cynthia Gouw), Talbot (David Warner) and Kurrd (Charles Cooper) relizing they have been set-up.  Sybok intends to take over the Enterprise.During the campfire scene with Kirk, McCoy and Spock, Spock introduces a Marshmallow dispenser.  In 1989-90, Kraft Incorporated actually released  Marshmallow dispensers as a special offer ( request of UPC symbols and fee) and sold the over-sized Marshmallows for the dispenser.

$REVIEW.: There have been many similar movies around this theme (Coming home still remains by far as the unbeatable film about his delicate issue) but what it confers this gripping and awful story that touch of grandness is the merciless, intense and real approach so typical of Oliver Stone.There are three remarkable aspects that basically, consolidate and reaffirm this movie as the best artistic achievement of Stone; the crudeness and incisiveness of this bitter script; the best performance given by Tom Cruise in his career and the unforgettable devastating images along the film, as that mesmerizing and metaphorical fight on the desert of Cruise and Dafoe.To my mind I must insist, this is the majuscule achievement in Oliver Stone's career.

$review_text.: The U.S. vs. John LennonI have nothing but problems with this documentary. Firstly, this is a manipulated version of the events. The seal of `Authorized' has cost this documentary its impartiality and honesty.This documentary has all the hallmarks of a Yoko Ono production. She is portrayed as a sympathetic talented artist with a heart of gold and inseparable if not the catalyst of John Lennon's emerging talent. So the message of this poor documentary is that `John would have been nothing without Yoko!'Not once is Julian Lennon mentioned in this perversion of History. Julian suffered all his young life with the pain of being ignored and rejected by his own Father. Yet when Yoko's son is born it is reported as if this experience is revelatory and the only one of significance.John and Yoko were having relationship problems before he died. In fact John was sleeping with another Asian girl introduced to him by Yoko. When John started to fall for her, Yoko terminated the relationship.It is a crime that John Lennon's legacy and fortune are in the hands of Yoko Ono who has proved on numerous occasions how morally malleable she is. Julian Lennon on the other hand is forced to go to auctions to bid for articles that once belonged to his dad. He still to this day not received a penny of John Lennon's wealth.The final insult to John's memory is having a sell-out like Geraldo Rivera comment on his life.

If a person likes history and can live with some of the poetic license that movie producers use or if one is not much on reading then this depiction is a well made extremely entaining movie. Kind of gives a person an idea of the pain a man went thru to create one of the wonders of the world, in my estimation.

$review_text.: I have been doing Pilates many months now each day before my Yoga practice and I can't say enough good things Pilates. At this point I have many excellent Pilates programs, including the outstanding Hilary Burnett Intermediate Pilates DVD!Though this program by Ana Caban is also an intermediate Pilates program it does have some different exercises than the Burnett. It includes a much more complete side lying series which are exercises that I find really beneficial (they really works the thighs, hips and glutes).I must admit that I was confused by some other reviewers complaints that this isn't an intermediate program because this DVD follows the Intermediate Pilates exercises plus includes many of the advanced exercises found in "Pilates, Body In Motion" by Alycea Ungaro.Anyway, I really like the flow of this program, the instruction, being geared to an intermediate practitioner, is kept to a minimum so as not to interrupt the flow which makes it very enjoyable to work with.My only complaint (and it's a VERY small one) would be that the audio is a bit strange in that sometimes it sounds like she's speaking "from the back of the room" where it's a bit echoey and other times the audio is more like a voice over (which is much easier to listen to and understand). I found this a bit distracting at times but it didn't take away from the overall excellence of this program.As in her Beginning Mat Work program she has another instructor who shows the poses in a more modified form if you need to work at a less intense level.I personally like Ana Caban as an instructor and find her personality to be enjoyable to practice with. She has a very positive and upbeat attitude which keeps it fun even while I'm being challenged :)Being that this is a true intermediate program, I would highly recommend getting a beginner program if you've never done Pilates before. The best one I have is the Stott Pilates Basics. Ana's beginning program is one I use as a less intense practice but the instruction isn't as precise as the Stott program. Pilates is a practice where precision is crucial in order to perform the exercises without straining your neck and back and without knowledge of the subtleties you may find you can hurt yourself, especially if you are working without a teacher.I don't have Hilary Burnett's Beginner program (just her intermediate as mentioned above) but I've heard that is excellent as well and plan on adding it to my collection to use for lighter days. Still, I don't own that yet so I'm passing along what I've heard.Anyway, this Ana Caban intermediate Pilates program is one I would highly recommend!Also, the DVD version of this program comes with a bonus Energy Boost workout which is 13 minutes long and is a fantastic extra workout. It alone is worth the prices of the DVD itself because it's short but very intense and it got my abs totally burning and fatigued in just 13 minutes. It's filmed on the beach in a beautiful tropical setting. I wish the whole intermediate DVD was filmed in the same setting but I guess you can't have everything! :)

$REVIEW.: Remember that creepy subway scene in Cloverfield?  Well, imagine if someone took the essentials of that scene and extended it to an entire movie then added a dash of insane religious zealotry (amplified to a borderline ridiculous amount).  That's End of the Line.Karen (Ilona Elkin) is a nurse in a psych ward who not only had a former patient just lose in a game of tag with a subway train, but she's also experiencing demonic hallucinations.  The question, "Who polices the police?" is a good one, but, "Who psychoanalyzes the psychoanalysts?" is just as scary.  Naturally, she takes the subway home the very same night as the death and her near breakdown.  Good call.  When several of the train's other occupants - nearly all dressed in stuffy, khaki outfits - receive a simultaneous text message, there is a sudden switch in their demeanor, and they begin to attack other passengers.What follows is a group effort similar to Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and others in the zombie genre, as the good guys attempt run and fight against the khaki Christians who are wielding knives and broadswords.  Led by alpha male Neil (Neil Napier) and a feisty Asian chick named Julie (Emily Shelton), the group grows to six as they pick up young lovers Sarah (Nina Fillis) and John (Tim Rozon).The clich&eacute;s of the horror genre are all followed (i.e. the group splits up); the gore is great, with stabbings, slashings, and one beheading; and there are several worthwhile shock scenes.  On the horror production efforts alone, this movie is very good.  Conversely...This could have been just as creepy without the religious fanatic angle.  When those few persuaded by their own insanity and a warped view of the actual purposes and messages of religion actually do something psychotic (in the scope of contemporary religion, not the Crusades), it's usually more of a cult, and it's in the tens, maybe hundreds, not the thousands necessary for the chaos purported by the events of this film.  And it's definitely not done by zealots spouting religious jingles that only the religiously uninformed would perpetually regurgitate. When the villains are dressed up as pseudo-Nazis, and the supposed attacks are mindless, incomplete, and world-wide, the comparisons appear more like a hackneyed religious attack than an attempt to create actual scares.  Stick to horror movies, and leave the perverse political perspectives elsewhere.If you can get past the political brow-beating, the horror is done fairly well.  Recommended for the hard core horror fan and the fanatic atheist.

Being an old opera production, the video shows its age.The audio and vocal performances are quite good, and will come across nicely with your home theater.  I would enjoy this much better if produced in HD but keeping the elegant staging.Now, for those that do not care if they see "film" marks, or the 3:4 aspect ration, this is a 5 star production.

$review_text.: An old woman (Nobuko Otowa) and her daughter-in-law (Jitsuko Yoshimura) eke out their living by selling the armor of the wounded samurai they murder while they wait for the man of the house to return from war.  One of his comrades (Kei Sato) returns instead to report that he has died, thereby setting in motion a vicious triangle.  The man wants the daughter-in-law, but the old woman fears that she will not be able to make a living by herself and is offended by her daughter-in-law's transfer of affection.  The situation comes to a head when a mysterious samurai wearing a demon mask appears.Director Kaneto Shindo has crafted a powerful film about elemental human impulses toward survival and sex and the terrible consequences that can result.  Given their desperate circumstances, it is difficult to condemn the characters for their actions, but this will not save them from the bad karma they have accumulated.  The sea of wind-blown grass that serves as the setting for the film is visually stunning and emphasizes the restlessness of the characters.  The black and white photography is beautiful as well.

$REVIEW.: I'm so glad there are small budget non-grandiose fantasy adventure movies that don't have the best CGI or even so-called academy award winning acting in it. Their just fun (even interesting) movies that aren't reaching for the stars, nonetheless can be good in their own way. DragonQuest (2009) is one of these.The story here is of a fabled world and a reluctant young man (Arkadi/Daniel Bonjour) who is more interested in the ladies yet nevertheless goes on a journey, the path of discovering the seven virtues which is ultimately an inner journey of self-discovery for him. It is a journey which brings victory and his well-being/maturity. And which includes here i might add, a reliable, solid, true companion Katya/Jennifer Dorogi - a strong and well played female part. Kind of a yin/yang thing which also plays into the whole Dragon theme of the story - dragon of light/truth and one of darkness/fear - the real and the unreal.This is done in a non-heavy handed way with a playful wise teacher Maxim/Marc Singer. The only real setback for this though is his "death scene", which is truly ridiculous, and mainly because the scene is so heavy-handed with his last speech being so self-important. It just didn't go well with the rest of his character. But i just looked passed it.Now besides that, the guys who put this together really put some thought into this movie - well made - just don't expect another movie like Lord of the Rings or make any comparison to anything else - just take it for what it is (don't look for perfection) and you might find something interesting and enjoy it.

$review_text.: Amazon have provided an excellent review of this macho adventure so I will only add the following:- those familiar with the director Howard Hawk's legacy will recognise the atmosphere, the relationships and even some of the dialogue from some of his later works, especially "To Have and Have Not".- Cary Grant, in a role tailor made for Clark Gable, does very well in a more rugged persona than he had played to date


The heroics are at times a bit cheesy but given the age of the film, that's OK.- this was the film which really launched Rita Hayworth


She had been in films for a few years at this stage but here, she is showcased and her star quality is obvious even if her acting is the weakest of the leads.- The film also was the last decent role for silent star Richard Barthelmess
He is well cast as the dour coward who must prove himself but his stardom was clearly over alongside dynamic Grant.- Jean Arthur glows as always


The best scene in a film littered with air crashes, action and buddy relationships is Arthur's scene in Grant's bungalow when they employ the witty banter and flirtatious manner for which they were renown.- the print is very good and the DVD contains a worthwhile featurette about Hawks and Grant.The film is best value purchased as part of one of the Cary Grant Signature Collections.

$REVIEW.: If you're not a fan of political correctness, and I'm not, you will love this thing. haw haw hawSubtle and bleak look at the future of surveillance and Big Brother. Sean Connery does 10 years in the joint, gets out on the same day with Christopher Walken, finds his ex girlfriend who lives rent free in an exclusive Manhattan apartment building, takes care of bidness, then while walking around in Dyan Cannon's robe (minus most of his hair), decides to rob the building.Great ensemble cast including Martin Balsam as a hilarious gay "decorator" who helps case the joint, and Garret Morris of Saturday Nite Live fame in an even more bizarre role as a police sergeant given the task of rappelling across the street with a makeshift SWAT team to rescue the building from Connery and his makeshift crew of crooks. Outstanding story that is totally marred by the annoying soundtrack and the constant reminder that "you are being watched!" Stupid tones and chimes galore with shots of video cameras everywhere and FBI all over the place recording phone calls and sexual this and that between Connery and Dyan Cannon who looks terrific, just wish we'd seen more of her and that body!I'd never heard of this flick before and now I understand why. Some excellent moments and performances that just get overridden by this goofy insertion of futuristic ding-donging that seemingly never ends, but I know what Lumet was going for. They even used the same font on the credits you will find on James Caan's Rollerball and Logan's Run. You know that computer generated font that everybody in Hollywood thought was going to be used in the year 2100? Anyway, its worth checking out, just don't expect to be blown away. 3 Safes

$REVIEW.: xxxHolic: First Collection has the first four shows of an interesting Anime series of xxxHolic.  We are introduced to Watanuki, a young student who has been followed by dark spirits ever since he was a child.  One day, he comes across a fortune teller shop.  The proprietor is a Witch named Yuko who takes care of Watnuki's spirit problem for a fee, he has to work at the shop and deal with her pet and two assistants.  Besides the supernatural and dark spirits that seem to bother all of the Yuko's clients, Watanuki has to contend with the usual high school drama as well.The DVD is in widescreen with the first four episodes with optional english 5.1, english 2.0 and Japanese 2.0.Optional English subtitles are available for the Japanese audio (highly recommended), a couple of songs from the show, a few previews and a photo gallery round out the extras.  Like most of the anime shows i have seen, I advise you to watch the original dialog, the english dubbing dumbs down a lot of the show's brilliantghost story line and the voices are so much cuter in Japanese.Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Simply put, this movie is scary.  Not as scary as the first Insiduous but that's because I already knew the premise.  But still scary nonetheless.  No spoilers.  But I really like how both movies came full circle.  You'll likely want to watch the first one again after seeing this.  Granted, there were a few moments of horror cheesiness, but this is still above par than most &#34;scary&#34; movies.  Even though the ending leaves room for a Chapter 3, I don't really know how much farther they can go with this storyline.  I hope this doesn't become another Paranormal Activity franchise.  I'm definitely a fan of James Wan now.  If you haven't seen The Conjuring, you should go see it now..during the day, that is, instead of at night before you go to bed.

$review_text.: Let's face it, for the most part, this movie is highly unbelievable. I don't know too many park rangers with the gall to arrest a captain of the Air Force. If we see red flames spewing from an atomic detenation, mostly  likely there's some radiation involved.  You would think that someone in  Deakin's position would have been through so many psyche screenings someone  would have known he's not intirely stable.  But if you can get past all  that, Broken Arrow can be rather entertaining. Travolta plays the  sociopathic Deakin's very cooly. His acting in this is nothing less than  fantastic. Though I must say that some of the other acting was rather dry  to say the least. Mr. Prichett in particular was just plain irratating. On  the positive side, there is a catching story line (upright captain has to  fight his best friend in order to keep him from setting off a nuclear  bomb). The action is good. As I said, Travolta's acting is great;  practically carries the film. The final word, I really enjoyed it, but can  easilly see why most others wouldn't. I'd suggest renting it.

$review_text.: This movie really does what a sport movie should do---create an exciting competative context in which human struggle and courage can be viewed.  The boys on this basketball team don't have many lines, but they really do become important to the viewer because we ache for their success so badly and when it comes, we feel the sweetness of human achievement.  Unlike REMEMBER THE TITANS, this movie leaves out any forced politically-correct message as part of the drama, which in my opinion makes it a more watchable movie. The DVD edition is not the greatest, even though the movie is.  It lacks extras, interviews, etc.  The quality of the print is neither exceptional nor lousy, somewhere in between.  If I knew that a collector's edition was coming out, I would have waited to purchase the DVD, but I couldn't wait since the movie itself is so good.  In addition, the price is very reasonable!

$review_text.: Hollywood reheats a classic, but this cheap serving is hardly very appetizing.  This remake throws some heavy morsels of CGI down your throat and will give you indigestion.Same basic story, some people volunteer to stay in an extravagant mansion.  This time they aren't told about the house's dark past.  They believe they are part of a study on insomnia.  The truth is they are part of a controlled experiment on group fear.Now I thought this was a nice alteration to the story.  But unfortunately it starts to get extremely ridiculous.  Nothing subtle here, there are plenty of cheap scares--like ghostly images or moving statues.  As it turns out this house is basically a holding cell for dead children's souls.  The evil landlord's spirit keeps watch over them in this purgatory.  Great, a perverted pedaphile ghost.This turns into more of a goofy adventure flick.  No spooky atmosphere or mystery.  No suspense.  No reason to bother.

$REVIEW.: The FIA Formula One season review has been around for quite a long time and has delivered solid quality reporting as far as the highlights of the championship season go. Until the advent of digital TV (or Bernievision) in F1 and the new format of the DVD those reviews were clearly limited to what you could put on a VHS and make available basically in movie format.The 2000 review DVD makes use of the menu and interactive capabilities by offering different angles on every race, the pitstops, the on-board cam, etc. Unfortunately there is the same (soemtimes lame) commentary associated with each angle, and each race report overall is pretty short.There are also no additional faetures, interviews etc. that follow the major off-track developments of the season.Overall the great advantages of more storage space and interactive cababilities of the DVD medium have not been used to their fullest
$SUMMARY.: does not take advantage of the new format...

$review_text.: If I was rating simply for the Kung Fu I would give this movie a 5+.  The fight scenes are pretty amazing and well choreographed (with the excpetion of Huo Yuan Jia's father's fight which is very disorienting and strange).  Needless to say, if you like fight scenes, you should bronze this baby!  This movie does fall short on the storyline - there are parts that are slow, and fiction enters an otherwise incredible, true story (the fight between Huo and Hercules never occurred and Huo Yuan Jia was actually a farmer with a lot of brothers and sisters - not a rich spoiled kid).  I really don't understand why Jet Li would want to alter a great story in Chinese history - it really only cheapens the accomplishment ---- that being said, I am searching for the lost footage which never made the cut.  I have a friend who say footage of Huo fighting in Thailand (a Thai boxer).  My friend said it was amazing! Why did they cut it?!!!  If you have any knowledge of where I can get a copy I will pay for info leading to its capture.  Cheers - MoLi HuaCha

$review_text.: When I think of stop-motion films, I think of  movies like "Rudolph the Red-nose Reindeer" which are geared towards little children, but "Fantastic Mr. Fox" is geared more towards adults.  Young children might find this too violent since there's chickens who get killed and Mr. Fox gets his tail cut off and you see some blood.  There's also characters who drink and smoke which is inappropriate for childrens' viewing.This movie also runs too long.  Just when I thought the movie would end, it kept going and going.  I don't see little kids being able to wait this movie out.So it's really adults who'll get a kick out of this movie, and not just the content, but the dry, sarcastic humor as well.  I found Mr. Fox amusing, but my favorite character was Mr. Fox's bitter son.  It was also amusing watching the world from an animal's point of view and all the clever animal humor mixed in.I was a little confused by the message, though.  Were these characters supposed to embrace their wild side or suppress it?Although that wasn't clear to me, overall, I found this witty and clever movie fun to watch.

What I saw was heartbreaking and can't wait to own this just so I can help my child understand also. So many kids(and adults) don't understand how bad it was to be black in America. They got a raw deal and many are still trying to catch up to the American dream today. I believe this is the most important program PBS has ever done. I'm just glad that we can now buy this program at an affordable price. I also hope there is a blu ray edition coming out. I may even buy a copy for my child's Junior High so even more can benefit from what is being taught here. PBS, please release Part 2 soon.

$review_text.: There are very few films that I truly came away from stunned
Fight Club was one

English Patient was another


Films that pushed the boundaries, did things differently and refused to conform to cliched and predictable Hollywood movies


Films that lean away from mere entertainment and more towards art


Without a doubt, American History X is one of these films.The storyline follows Daniel (Edward Furlong) and his older brother Derrick (Edward Norton)
Both are restless white skinheads who are part of a neo-nazi skinhead gang

The plot unravels Derricks penchant for leadership while Daniel looks up to him in awe


Filmed in both colour and black and white, this is very powerful film-making backed up by powerful performances.Much of the story holds a message, which is one that I'll leave for you to find out yourselves

It looks at racism, both from whites and blacks

It looks at those who look past the colour of someone's skin or hold no grudge for prejudice that another man holds
It looks at family and role models


It looks at the unnecessary anger that a whole generation of people can have.This is a powerful and impressing film that everyone should see.

 So grab your popcorn and settle in for a great motion  picture treat

Adam (Howard Keel) brings home his bride (Jane Powell), who  thinks she is finally going &quot;to cook for just one man&quot;, to a  mountain cabin filled with his six younger brothers

 The six boys, naive  due to lack of education in the finer things of life, are taught by their  new &quot;big sister&quot; how to dance and court a girl

 Adam read in one  of his new wife's two books about the Sabine women who were carried off by  the Romans
 When he told his brothers about this, they decided to try this  method of betrothal for themselves

 So they went on a bride roundup
 They  ended up snowed in for the winter with the girls, but no brides

 Somebody  forgot to bring the parson! The story is full of fun, frolic, singing and  dancing galore
 Everyone in the family has a treat in store when they  watch &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.&quot;

I'm glad it hasn't been forgotten.It's the future, and the corporations have taken over, providing bread and circuses to the masses while doing all the things corporations are known for doing. The popular blood sport Rollerball is the 'circuses' part, and Jonathan E (Caan) is one of its great stars.For the rest of the story, watch the movie. After you do, you'll never again feel quite the same about Super Bowl Sunday.This is classic dark-SF cinema, well acted and filmed, with high production values and a cyberpunk edge that predated cyberpunk. It's something like _Mad Max_ on anabolic steroids.And give the remake a miss. This is the good one.

$review_text.: Magnum Force (1973) the first of four Dirty Harry sequels is a film,  action movie/ Eastwood junkies will appreciate a great deal. It softens Dirty Harry's character however and actually makes more political type statements regarding how criminals often have more rights in the legal system than crime victims do --than the original Dirty Harry ever did. It makes sure the audience understands that Dirty Harry Callahan is a rogue lone wolf cop who breaks rules but he is not a vigilante who takes the law completely into his own hands. He's a hero and his flaws say the movie are completely acceptable.In Magnum Force, Harry is back on the force  and fighting with a new superior who he makes very nervous.  Harry discovers that a team of police officers have turned into a small hit squad and they are knocking off pimps, drug dealers and assorted criminals whenever possible.  They figure Harry would approve of what they are doing and even join them.  When Harry has a problem with what they are doing... they have a problem with Harry.  Get the picture?There's a lot more dialogue concerning weapons and the former most powerful handgun in the world the 44 magnum.  The script is partially written by John Millius and Michael Cimino and you can tell.  Ted Post directed and he doesn't bring the style or skill that Siegel brought to the first one, but he keeps things moving at a brisk efficient pace.  Hal Holbrook was excited to be part of the film because he knew lots of people would go see it.  David Soul and Robert Uhrick also make early career appearances here.  It's not a great genre film but it mostly holds up pretty well and is entertaining.  Look fast for Suzanne Somers during the pool party scene.DVD STUFFNearly all of the films in the new Dirty Harry Collection of DVD's are presented in Anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreenMost of the 5  Dirty Harry films recently released are presented at their best with colors vibrant, black levels strong and few technical problems present.All of the Harry films have been given a complete audio over-haul and the engineers have done a superb job on all the films for their latest NOVEMBER 2001 release.  The older films in particular have been improved a great deal with a very well done sound re-design.  I suspect some re-recording of some foley type effects took place because some of the sound effects sound utterly free from distortion which you would expect to crop up in loud sound effects from 30 years ago.  All of the films have a Dolby 5.1. track that has been masterfully presented.  Dialogue is easy to hear, and the sound effectsAnd music effectively use the surround capabilities of all the speakers without over-doing it .DVD Extras:Magnum Force gets the 8 minute featurette entitled The Hero Cop: Yesterday and Today and was made as part of the promotional campaign for film in 1973.  It has some behind the scene snippets of Ted Post directing Eastwood.  The original trailer is not in very good shape on this one.3 and a half stars... 4 if you love Dirty Harry or Eastwood.Christopher Jarmick, is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder a critically acclaimed, steamy suspense

Thora Birch does an exceptional job playing a girl whose family life is chaotic (her mother is a drug addict, her father is mentally ill).She's the butt of jokes at school because she has had no training in normal social behanvior and her home is so cluttered and messy that finding clean clothes to wear is a major challenge.Somehow she manages to rise above her circumstances, beating the odds and going to Harvard.

$review_text.: Well, after the Phantom Menace had me slightly worried about the future Star Wars prequels, George Lucas has made me a believer again. I am happy to say that (mercifully) Jar-Jar Binks (probably the most annoying character to EVER hit the big screen) was given about 2-3 minutes of total screen time in this movie, which made watching it MUCH more like one of the classic Star Wars movies. It had a darker feel, the story moved a bit faster, Yoda kicks butt, and they captured the romance of Star Wars (i.e. Han & Leia) by bringing Anakin & Senator Amidala  together. You also get to see the dark side of the force starting to weave its way into Anakin's heart in Episode II. The battle between the Jedi & the Imperial droids is unbelievable & the introduction of Jango & son Boba Fett AND the first wave of Stormtroopers (clones). This made it worth Jar-Jar in the Episode I, which would've been much better had Jar-Jar's role been reduced to about 10 scenes less (or about 10 lines less)than he had. Anyway, it's great and I recommend it highly to all Star Wars fans and fans of the Space/Sci-Fi genre in general.

$REVIEW.: Fascinating look at a Vegas beauty pageant for transsexuals. . .but probably not in ways some contestants ever imagined. Although contest was ostensibly held to promote transgender acceptance (or so most of the entrants keep insisting), this high-minded "cause" somehow gets lost in the shuffle as the garishly made-up gals parade up and down Vegas Strip in porn star/hooker attire, accost tourists with fliers for their contest, unbutton shirts of male vacationers while delivering ribald come-ons and flaunt boob jobs to gaping poolsiders.Aside from thoughtful looks at backgrounds of several contestants (including photos of pre-op boyhoods) and their families, pretty much unfolds like a real-life sex-change version of Showgirls, complete with plenty of boobs, bare butts and (following announcement of winner) bitchy banter galore.Nice companion piece to The Queen, a 1968 documentary about a New York transvestite pageant--to which it is nearly identical, give or take some reconstructed genitalia.

 I saw that a lot of people gave out just average or just okay comments


 However, what I think is different because this one is very exciting and scary in all scenes in this movie
 For the story, since it is a remake since 1953, it has no that much changes from what I believe

 So, it is okay

 For the acting, these casts has awesome actings especially Elisha Cuthbert as Carly Jones and Chad Michael Murray as Nick Jones


 Also, Brian Van Holt acts well in this row of Bo/Vincent twins (the evil twins who wants to kill and make them as wax)

 Oh my god, he can act very evil


 For others, they are okay like Paris Hilton as Paige Edwards


 She is quite hot and sexy
 For the direction, it is good because it is quite in sequence in every scene


 For the visual, it is very good especially the scene of the house of wax collapsing in the end


 For the music and sound effect, it is well done because it makes a very exciting music and sound effect, which brings the tension of the whole movie

 So, it is a good movie

 Go for it, guys.

$REVIEW.: This was a great movie,when I first saw it so many years ago, in the summer of 1983

I saw it in Vintage Faire Cinema, Modesto, CA.Admittedly, it is likely to be assumed that the sequel to such an iconic film would  be &#34;horrible.&#34; I've often wondered over the years, if such an attitude helped lead this movie to  better reviews

The old: expect  less, surprised by more...Also, it was this movie that introduced me to Jerry Goldsmith, famous composer, who wrote the Original Sound Track


 It was reported that after Anthony Perkins listened to this music, he actually wept, he enjoyed it that much

I would go on to listen to many more soundtracks by this composer.The Blu Ray transfer is better than I expected, but I honestly thought it was a little dark, and washed out

 The special features were good, but I was very confused by  the &#34;Audio Commentary&#34; by famous celebrities  attached to the  project, including several actors, and the producer (but alas, nothing from Alfred Hitchcock,  the director of the Original Psych.)  The movie starts, and on  a certain  audio track,you hear  a  volume come  up,and an introduction from an announcer...then you hear an audio interview  from each person,  several, throughout.There's no &#34;commentary&#34; on the scene you are watching; each celebrity is reintroduced, and  the words you hear him announce, are repetitive
It's very poorly done, in my opinion

 It seems like &#34;Special Feature fluff.&#34; I've never experienced anything quite like it.I  will still award it 4 stars, but I was not super thrilled with the special features, especially the one described.

$review_text.: Offhand, season 6 is much the same show Smallville has been the previous years, with leaps of logic, poor characterizations, irratic plot development, etc. However there are a few goodies this year that make the overall season worth checking out.Justin Hartley guests as Green Arrow for the first half of the season. Arrow is everything Clark has not been; decisive, charismatic, and -gasp!- heroic. The special effects show CW can do a full superhero show on a tv budget, and the writers do well when they're not stretching characters over 6+ years. The arc culminates with all the previous guest heroes in a "Justice League" episode, which is quite entertaining.Also entertaining is this year's main storyline of Clark stopping Phantom Zone escapees. They lend a nice twist to the 'freak of the week' staple. Lex Luthor pushes his project of a super-powered army, and a glowing-eyed visitor played by Phil Morris helps Clark. Jimmy Olsen romances Chloe (don't think about the screwy timeline, Aaron Ashmore does a fine job), and a film noir episode shows Smallville's cinematography at its best.It's a shame so much is dragged down by the Lex/Lana relationship, which hits higher and higher peaks of absurdity as the season progresses. And the adult characters get seriously shortchanged this year - goodbye to Annette O'Toole, as this season is her last. How a show about responsiblity, values, and growing up can continue without both parental figures boggles the mind.The specs haven't been announced yet, but Smallville dvds in the past have offered 2-3 commentary tracks, loads of deleted scenes, and some featurettes. I hope they also include the 'Justice' online comic, which was a fun side story like the Chloe Chronicles. Check out season 6 for the good and leave the bad, and hang in there for season 7.

$review_text.: Well........I can't say I was as nuts about this film as were some others but I did find it interesting and a decent early effort by writer/director Travis Betz. He only has a few other projects under his belt so he knew enough what he had to do to get Lo done with, what must have been, a tiny budget.It seems a large part of the budget was making the costumes for Lo, Jeez and a 3rd demon who's name I do not know. Said costumes all actually decent with Lo's being the best. Other than that you have 5 sets with some peculiar lighting with the main set consisting of a small area of floor with a pentagle painted on it. All around it is total black so they could have shot that in someone's basement and the viewer would be none the wiser.The story is OK. A guy summons a demon to go to hell, find his girlfriend, and bring her back to him. Of course things get a bit more complicated and all is not as it seems.With a movie like this it's all in the writing and acting. The acting is OK. I was rather surprised at the number of projects some of the actors had under their belts before they got to this one. The story is OK. What helps make it is the twist ending. Where it suffers is in the writing. I get the whole infusion of humor into the dialogue thing which is a staple in a lot of horror movies. But here the humor isn't that clever and some of the rest of the dialogue is unnecessarily course which undercuts the overall feeling and direction of things.As I said. This is a good early effort. I hope Betz watches this over and over to see where he went right and where he went wrong so he can punch up his next effort a few more notches.

The cast is great, James Gammon is perfect for the role of an old drunkard (considering his natural raspy voice) and so is Chris Elliot for a dimwitted inbred rich boy.Its hilarious as he gets exploited and used by the &quot;filthy drunkards&quot; of sailors once they get a whiff of his high falutin attitude.

$REVIEW.: Birdcage is an American remake of the French classic La Cage Aux Folles, and if you have seen the original movie then you will be sorely disappointed with Birdcage.Although the film has fine cast, including Nathan Lane( playing Michel Serrault's camp Albin part) and the always excellent Robin Williams (playing Ugo Tognazzi's Renato part), the filmsuffers from one major flaw, it is nowhere near as funny as La Cage Aux Folles, and no matter how good an actor Lane is, no one can honestly come close to playing the camp Albin as good as Michel Serrault did. So for those of us who have seen the original film and can't help but comparing the two, that poses a big problem.Secondly, it is a Hollywood tradition to adapt great French movies, but to 'adapt' is one thing, to 'copy' is something else altogether. This copying tradition has been repeated many times, most notably with Assasin,a scene by scene copy of La Femme Nikita. Now maybe the producers assume that not many viewers watch 'foreign arty' films and as such they can get away with their free adaptation, but there are many of us out there who do, and much more in the age of reasonably priced DVDs available at your doorstep at a click.So for those who have not seen La Cage Aux Folles, you should check the original French movie for some serious laughs and look in awe at no less than a genuis performance by Serrault, and just hope that in the future, whenever Hollywood wants to adapt other 'foreign' movies, it would be just that,to Adapt.
$SUMMARY.: A  Mediocre  Copy

$review_text.: I've read the Christmas Carol many times and it is my favorite traditional Christmas movie


 For those who do not know, the story is about the redemption of a man so heartless that drastic measures have to be taken.However, the measures taken in this movie are too drastic
 It should have been rated PG-13
 In short, they destroyed the wonderful beginning


 The film had promise, but it didn't keep that promise


 I wish I had Red-Boxed it first.I give the talented voice-actors a solid 5.The animation a solid 4 - because sometimes Scrooge looked wall-eyed or cross-eyed.The script gets no stars and Disney a -6 for stamping their approval on a vastly inferior production.Below are spoilers, but a few reasons I can't give this film a better rating.Marley's lower jaw became unhitched during his famous rant and he had to manipulate it to speak
 Macabre and bizarre


 All previous versions of Marley had at least stirred some empathy from me, but not this one


 I liked his long chains and locked trunks better than him.The ghost from Christmas past was a flame-headed alien with an unpleasantly sinister voice
If you read the book, you will find the ghost looked human - most of the time, not like a wandering candle


 This was never my favorite ghost, but at least the ghost showed more human qualities in the other productions.The second is usually my favorite ghost
 What isn't to love?  He looks like and laughs like Father Christmas

 However, in this version, the ghost has a heart-attack, complete with gripping his chest and moaning in pain


 He turns chalk-white and dies in front of Scrooge - disintegrating into a laughing skeleton while the twins of ignorance and want become, respectively, a criminal and a screaming lunatic (literally).The last ghost, the one that everyone should expect to be creepy, finally fits the bill and they did a great job with him

 BUT they added a long drawn-out chase scene involving red-eyed horses that chase an ever shrinking-in-size Scrooge who then speaks like someone that's been sucking helium
 Here, the film became a confusing collage of Sleepy Hollow and Darby O' Gill meet Scrooge!At the end, where Scrooge is cavorting around, lightened of his decades-old burden of acknowledging the miracle he's been given, the cleaning woman freaks out and swears
 It wasn't needed and it wasn't funny

 There were no warm fuzzy feelings for me at the end


 I did not rejoice for Scrooge because it fell far short of my expectations
 I say save your money and time, don't bother with this one - watch the one with George C Scott as Scrooge.

It's the same story told over & over by different people, once told is enough to get the idea & the rest is just boring, unfortunately. I had hoped it would be different versions of the joke at least, and told in different styles, but in fact it was the exact same joke told same way, repeatedly. The only funny part was Phillis Diller. The joke itself wasn't at all funny, instead relying more on shock value for the laugh.

$review_text.: AEon Flux (Karyn Kusama, 2005)I'm a very big fan of both Karyn Kusama (Girlfight) and Charlize Theron (Monster)
So when I found out that the big-screen adaptation of Peter Chung's wonderful animated series AEon Flux would star Theron and be directed by Kusama, I was hopeful that the film would have some teeth to it
Alas, as everyone in the world but me seemingly knew, I was wrong.Theron plays the title character, who lives in a world whose five million inhabitants all live in a single city, the world outside having "gone back to nature." The city has been ruled by a benevolent dictator for most of those four hundred years, but things have started getting a little weird, and a rebel faction, the Monicans, has sprung up
AEon Flux is a member of the Monican resistance, and she gets an assignment from her handler (Fargo's Frances MacDormand) to assassinate said dictator, Trevor Goodchild (xXx's Martin Csokas)

Except that, well, something makes her hesitate, and that something is the vast coincidence upon which the entire film turns

And once you accept that fact that you've been handed a vast coincidence, the whole thing simply falls apart, becoming nothing more than an excuse for a mindless shoot-em-up with all sorts of nifty special effects

(Sophie Okonedo's character, who has had her feet replaced with a second set of hands, is the recipient of, by far, the coolest of the film's effects.)So, the short answer: the only reason to watch this film has to do with Charlize Theron and a few yards of skintight leather
Which, I admit, could have even made Reds worth watching, really
But be prepared for the fact that Girlfight this ain't

$review_text.: Leonard Maltin calls "Missouri Breaks" a BOMB.  I think he's looking in the mirror and sees everything backwards.  "Missouri Breaks" is a studied, nuanced, greatly acted, directed, scored, designed, and photographed masterwork.  It is pure genius from Penn, Brando and Nicholson in carefully shaded characters, and a marvelously talented supporting cast headed by Harry Dean Stanton and Kathleen Loyd.  There are no false steps.The violence Maltin decries is sudden, graphic, and realistic.  It shows the brutal nature of the frontier American experience directly, without moral or relish.  If anything, it is sincere reportage, which may be what Maltin really finds objectionable; we do like our pretty myths. Students of American western frontier history will instantly recognize the authenticity of setting, society, and events.He calls it "plodding."  It's about a bunch of lazy no-count horse thieves, who are at bottom just human beings with tough beginnings trying to survive in tough conditions.  It is a leisured film, but not casual.  The viewer enters the world on the screen, to dwell intimately therein as a participant observer, seeing at ground level how these people deal with the events of both a mundane and peculiar life.  "Breaks" creates a solid environment with a natural pace that enters the remorseless realm of Greek tragedy.  We watch helplessly as the players march relentlessly to an avoidable, but inevitable climax.  We see the survivors in the brief still aftermath fumble for new lives, and new beginnings.If as Maltin says, "Missouri Breaks" is a BOMB, I guess I like this BOMB VERY MUCH.  It is a mature, fully realized vision, film as literature that matures like fine wine.  Highly recommended for people who think.  Leonard?

The fact that Nicholson is playing so off-character makes this a role well worth seeing him in.  Streep is good, Tom Waits is GREAT as Rudy.  The film is not for depressives, however.  PLEASE RELEASE THIS IMPORTANT FILM IN DVD FORMAT!!  With all the toppings, please.

$REVIEW.: I am going to do this review in a different fashion then some of the previous ones.  First off I did not buy this off of Amazon, I was lucky enough to find this at record store just my luck because it is out of print, WTF MGM! (for those of you who are not aware MGM bought the rights to this film a couple years back, just so they own everything Bond related).  The great thing about this movie is of course the return of Sean Connery to the role of Bond, if it wasnt for him this movie would suck soooooo much.  The reason being is because this is a remake, meaning everything here has already been done previously in Thunderball, and yet because of Connerys return this is a must have for Bond super fans.  The movie starts off with a great opening action scene, but the problem with the intro is that you dont get that familiar gun barrel sequence that we all know love and the theme....well its kind of lame.  Once movie gets going its really not that bad, idk why fans hate it so much there have been cheesier EON Bond movies.  This movie has grit, like all of the earlier Connery Bond movies its just great to have to have that again.  Sean Connery just has this likability about him, he was the first cinema Bond and he paved the way for all the other actors.  If you are a die hard fan and you get a chance to pick this movie up, do it because you never know when or if you will ever come by it again.  After all as of this review, its out of print and pretty rare!

$review_text.: I assume most people contemplating buying this set already know what they're getting into so I won't review the show, just the set.I got this about two years ago

 I read lots of complaints about the sturdiness of the box, so I took someones advice from another review and turned the bottom drawer that contains the poster, comic book, episode guide, etc

upside down
 My box is still in great shape so maybe that does help support the weight of the DVDs
 I've made it all the way through the set and every DVD played fine, no defects

 I'm very pleased.As most of you know, this contains every season of The X-Files and the first feature film

 This does not contain "The X-Files: I Want To Believe" as this box set was made before that films release


 They can't really help that.Included are ALL special features from the original DVD sets

 It's great to have them available again


 Each season includes a featurette, deleted scenes, audio commentaries, a DVD-ROM game, TV promos and assorted behind-the-scenes stuff throughout (special effects clips, interviews, etc.)

 The X-Files was the first TV show to be released on DVD and they set a great standard, going all out
 Also included is a bonus disc with the featurettes from the Mythology set releases.The nick-knacks are inessential but a nice addition
 There's an episode guide, a cool poster for the movie which I hung on my wall, a comic book (mine came with two copies!), and art cards

 The episode guide contains a few paragraphs about the season, a list of all episodes with a small still and short description of each
 It's nice but don't get your hopes up, it's nothing that would be sold by itself.Great set if you want to get all the seasons at once with all the special features, as most of the single season sets in print right now don't include the bonus discs
 The price is a little high right now

When I bought it two years ago, it was $150 on Amazon


 No idea why it's jumped over $100

 I thought prices usually go down after time.

$review_text.: Some movies are critical favorites because they cater specifically to critic. Some movies are so great that they appeal to all groups. Dancer in the Dark is a marvelous spectacle that falls into the latter of the two categories.Bjork's specialty is quirky music and quirkier videos. This movie falls right into her genre, but is also a finely crafted masterpiece. It is a look into the life of a woman who's site is quickly failing and wants to raise the necessary money for her son to have an operation to save him from the same fate before she herself goes blind.The actors in this movie do not have airs of stars- they all play their roles with exacting attention to detail. And Bjork does a great job. It was she who write and performedthe soundtrack. There are dance sequences to some of her songs throughout the movie, but they fit neatly into the plot. Actually, they provide the relief necessary in this intense film. (Author's note: While watching the movie, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and actually got a charlie-horse because I was so tense.)This movie is great and deserved its prize at Cannes. I highly recommend it, just know that it is no light film.

$review_text.: Sixteen-year-old Joan Girardi thinks she's cracking up when God begins speaking to her. In the form of a cute teenage boy on the street, of an elderly woman volunteering at her school, or of someone on television, Joan keeps getting messages from God, telling her what she needs to do.It's about the last thing Joan needs. She's just moved to Arcadia, where her dad Will is the new police chief, and she and her geeky younger brother Luke have to get used to a new school. Meanwhile, Joan's older brother Kevin has his own struggles since becoming a paraplegic in a car wreck just after high school graduation -- struggles which have drastically changed the entire family.Although Joan doesn't understand the directions that God gives her, she does her best to obey...even when it causes misunderstandings and sometimes arguments between herself and those around her. Ultimately, she tends to see that whatever God tells her to do ends in a positive change reaction, such as when she befriends a classmate named Adam, whose father is a janitor for the police department, and knows of an impounded handicapped accessible car that could help Kevin put his life back together.This was, quite unexpectedly, one of my all-time favorite television shows. I was so disappointed when it was abruptly taken off the air after only two seasons...

$review_text.: If it is viewed as a study of a woman who needs - and enjoys - continual and varied sex, it might have promise; but once the compulsion is made evident, the author does not seem to know where to go next, and the story line sputters and grinds to a monotonous conclusion

It is wonderful to see an aging Geraldine Chaplin still working as the heroine's guiding angel.

$review_text.: Header pretty much says it. B-movie lovers should enjoy this one. Found the visit to Harry Novak's studio worth the price of admission alone, although they did leave out low-budget filmmakers like Andy Milligan, Brownrigg(the guy who made Don't Look in the Basement) Ed Wood & some others. On the other hand, you get interviews with the one and only Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Doris Wishman, David Friedman,  etc., etc.--not to mention plenty of T & A footage.Like I said: it's for those who grew up on B-movies and continue to have an appreciation for them. Grab a brewskie, a bag of popcorn, sit back and enjoy.

$REVIEW.: The Twilight Zone is the best of the thought-provoking SciFi (I wouldn't call them horror) series' of all time. I've watched them all...Outer Limits, Night Gallery (also Rod Serling), Tales From The Crypt, etc. What makes TZ stories really good are the relationship to true-life fears, emotions and imagination. They were ahead of their time still being &#34;right on&#34; in today's world. And the best (IMO) were written by Rod Serling.All the shows are enhanced along with remastered audio. This set includes almost everything from each season including Rod Serling's end-of-show talk with a tidbit of information about the next show. There are many of the original (CBS sponsored) commercials other than &#34;a word from our alternate sponsor.&#34;  Plus, there are some of the actor's interviews and other commentaries from the cast and crew and more. This is a Great Set!I've watched these now with friends and family 20, 30, even 40 years my junior and I have created a new fan base of T-Zoners (my made up term). Will you join us?FYI: The blu-ray version includes SDH closed captioning and all discs have their own (non-touching) slot in each DVD case. Buy only from Amazon or a reputable seller so you don't get ripped-off as I see from the few 1 star reviews.

$REVIEW.: Granted, it didn't cost but a few dollars more than the single disc, but the "extras" here are laughable.  You get a featurette about how Hans Zimmer came up with the theme for the Joker... all two notes of it.  Great theme, yes, but do we really need ten minutes of watching him have a cello player play two notes repeatedly?  Then you get the scenes originally shot in IMAX in their IMAX format.  Great.  While they're clearer, on a TV it's not a big bonus.Totally uninteresting is a featurette on the batsuit; the bat-cycle is slightly more, but not much.Here's what it doesn't have:-NO commentary, director or otherwise (EDIT: Wayne just informed me Nolan doesn't do commentaries, so that explains that)-NO making-of featurette-NO interviews with cast and crew-NO deleted/alternate scenes-NO SFX featurettes on how they did certain scenesIn other words, none of the standard bonus features you'd expect from a ONE disc set, much less two.  They obviously rushed this out for the holidays and are going to hit us all up a second time for a "Deluxe Edition" containing all the things that the advertising suggested would be in this one.  You've been had.However, if you really, really must have it now, yes: it looks and sounds great and as superhero movies go, it doesn't get any better than this.  Heath Ledger just makes the movie.  So, buy it if you must have it to watch now--but for your permanent copy, unfortunately, you're going to have to wait for the DVD that has all the stuff you thought was on this one.

$REVIEW.: I like Jennifer Lawrence, she can act! After seeing her performances in Winter's Bone (2010) and The Burning Plain (2008) I have made it a point to follow her career. Solid actors and actresses are a rare breed in Hollywood so one best follow along while you can because once their first big budget, blockbuster hit comes along wherein style trumps substance, the days of truly human performances are gone.  Such was the case with Ashley Judd, Halle Berry, Tom Cruise, just to name a few.Nevertheless, I decide to go and see The Hunger Games (2012) because the movie looked to be a deft fusion of style and substance.  And for the most part it delivered.The StoryCo-written and directed by Gary Ross, The Hunger Games is based on the Suzanne Collins novel of the same name.  Jennifer Lawrence ( stars as Katniss Everdeen a 16-year old who along with her sister, Primrose (Willow Shields) and mother (Paula Malcomson) inhabit a world wherein hunger is the norm and Fascism rules in a place called Penem.As the movie opens it is time for The Hunger Games, a vulgar little affair in which one boy and one girl are chosen from each of the 12 districts surrounding the capital fight to the death on live television.  The winner will be fed for life, but there can be only one winner.  Katniss' sister Primrose is selected from their district, but Katniss volunteers to take her place.  Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) is the boy chosen.My ThoughtsHaving never read the book upon which this movie was made I cannot speak to how close one followed the other.  I can state however that I did enjoy the movie.  Jennifer Lawrence turned in a meaty performance as the bow and arrow yielding heroine who uses her cunning to survive the cutthroat game of death.  I found her character believable, tough, but compassionate, and having never read the book, I was on the edge of my seat at times wonder what would happen to her.The Hunger Games is adequately dark to qualify as a thriller, but overly so.  The gee-wiz computer generated wizardry that has so marked movies out of Hollywood, was kept to a dull roar while the human story(s) were allowed to take center stage; yes my fellow movie lovers, real acting was allowed to take flower!The Hunger Games is rated PG-13 no doubt for its violent overtone; swearing is kept to a minimum and there is no sex to speak of.  Indeed other than wanton and sometime callous violence--something American teens are used to--there is nothing offense about the movie.When the credits rolled I was left wanting more, only because the story remained unfinished; this will be taken up by sequels, good thing because there were a lot of unanswered question dancing in the air at the end of the movie. Before they are released however I will read the book(s) just to flesh out the parts that were left on the editing room floor.  Final Analysis: see the The Hunger Games!

$REVIEW.: Guys,I,m not wanting to start an argument here,but I have to say,lets get a wee bit realistic here in the reviews of One Eyed Jacks blu-ray.First of,aye,the blu-ray picture quality of OEJ leaves a LOT to be desired,and that,s me being kind,it is terrible for a blu-ray to have this kind of "picture quality"???? but that,s comparing it to other blu-rays!!!!!Now,I was very lucky to purchase a reasonably good PQ,widescreen,dvd of OEJ in a sale bin in Orlando,2002,for $5,and I was delighted,because,every other dvd I had seen was,quite frankly,CRAP,even the tv showings left a lot to be desired,so,when I found out it was being released on blu-ray I had great "hopes",sadly this wasn,t to be,the blu-ray PQ was definitely sub-standard,HOWEVER,it,s a huge jump in PQ compared to the truly CRAP dvd,s we,ve had to put up with for all those years,and that,s how I,m "judging" OEJ,Blu-ray compared to DVD,and this blu-ray is a definite winner in that comparison.I totally agree with one of the previous reviewers,One Eyed Jacks is definitely not going to get the same blu-ray treatment as some of the "new stuff",and it,s obvious that the print they,ve taken this transfer from is very dodgy,to say the least,so,lets be thankful that,for as bad as the PQ is,it,s much better PQ than the terrible dvd,s we,ve had to put up with.Lastly,I,m old enough to remember seeing this first time around at the Cinema,it,s a great shame that this very undervalued,underrated western is receiving,well lets be frank,no treatment whatsoever!!!!!!!I had a wry smile at the end of One Eyed Jacks blu-ray,thinking,OEJ was made in Vistavision,so was The Searchers!!!!that,s where the blu-ray PQ comparison ends,so I aint disagreeing with the other reviews,I,m just asking for the blu-ray to be compared to the dvd,by the way,I bought my OEJ from amazon germany,it  cost me just over $10,including p&p;,so,a better than dvd PQ of OEJ for $10-12,I can go with that.Davy Cairns,Scotland.

Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric, a successful businessman, likes to work during lunch hours and to walk in the streets of Paris in the afternoon in order  to admire the beautiful lonely girls. He reads Captain Cook's travel books  and daydreams a lot. He lives the &quot;bourgeois&quot; life by  excellence.Then come Chloe and Temptation. In fact, why not enjoy life  and do like everybody else ? A wife for the saturday nights and a  girlfriend for the rest of the week ! And Chloe is so fragile, she just  wants a child from him. Is Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric going to fall ? Watch CHLOE IN THE  AFTERNOON, the last of Eric Rohmer's moral tales, and try not to succumb to  the disguises of the devil.Like in the Holy Bible, the Devil can have  different faces : in Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric's vision, Lucifer is hidden behind the faces  of the women appearing in the two precedent Rohmer's movies : MY NIGHT AT  MAUD'S and CLAIRE'S KNEE. Superb idea !In CHLOE IN THE AFTERNOON,  Rohmer's actors sound more professional than in the french director's other  movies. But it's just an impression because if you take a look at the  filmography of most of these actors, you scarcely will find other movie  credits. It surely takes a while to get rid of the impression that these  actors don't play well ; they are amateurs (at least, I think so !) playing  according to Eric Rohmer's notion of Reality. His Reality.As always,  sound and audio are of VHS quality. No more. No extra-feature except a  scene access (Is it a bonus feature, anyway ?).A DVD dedicated to Bill.

$REVIEW.: This is quite possibly one of the most important movies in the last 20 yrs


Michael Moore by putting his own passion and blood into the making of this movie, showing corporate greed at all levels from political to civil , got an Oscar for this film and he pretty much cemented himself as one of the bravest and strongest directors ever.Shot on location in Flint Michigan, with real people including former corrupt President Ronald Reagan, this movie it as real as it gets
It pretty much started the whole documentaries on exposing corporate greed and well the downhill and moral decline of America (also shown in "The Big One" and "Bowling for Columbine" (which won the Oscar for Michael Moore).Before I get more into depth of the movie, I asked you to remember these image in your heads to show you how sad the situation in Flint Michigan both in 1989 and 2003 are:In the movie while General Motors is showing profits of over a billion dollars,they disgusting laid off over 25,000 factory workers


I repeat General Motors was showing a profit, not a loss, yet they decided to lay of thousands of people basically giving them a death sentence.Most factory workers didn't have the money to pay for their mortgage and were evicted,during one scene in the movie as many as 25 people in one day were evicted even on Christmas Eve.To show the real disgusting situation

A poor and mentally disturbed woman by the name of Rhonda Britton is so desperate to get money for her kids that she tries to sell Rabbits as pets
When that doesn't work she ends literally killing these poor animals and selling them as meat!!!! Which includes skinning them alive!!! The real sad part is that there a million dollar GM hotel only a few yars from where this women is doing this acts to get any form of help for herself.Basically Flint , Michigan as shown in the movie, from once a booming celestial center of action, is now a corrupt, poor , and crime infested city with no hope even amidst the lies of former Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Reagan's promise that they "would change the situation".In fact Reagan as shown in the movie uses Flint basically as a campaign ploy to elect himself during the 1980's
It's disgusting.Now the plot deals with General Motors and their disgusting actions of laying of well basically everyone who works for them in the factory


Even amidst Union groups like UAW , and booming profits, GM pulls the most disgusting acts reported in corporate history.So Michael Moore seeing the situation that is happening, makes this movie as he puts it during the trailer "I did this movie to raise the spirits of the workers"
Indeed he did, but more importantly he showed America and the world corporate greed up close and personal and the many people covering up the lie that all is well on GM.For instance Anita Bryant, Bob Eubanks and Pat Boone are 3 disgusting American celebrities who basically are hired by GM to fool the town into thinking everythings nice at Flint Michigan

They hire them for Carnivals, parades, tourism, nything


In Eubanks case as shown in the film, this self indulgent pig is promoting his newlywed game

Eubank is one of the first celebrities that Moore exposes

Eubanks at first seeing Moore doesn't think that Moore wont do much damage.And thats the big mistake that everyone at Flint Michigan does as quoted in the commentary by Moore "getting an interview with these people was easy...because they just took look one look at me and figured oh this isn't going anywhere".My God how wrong those people are

As stated in the first sentence where Eubanks shows his antisemetic joke, he obviously didn't think Moore's movie would have any impact

but furthermore, Eubanks is the typical example of every greedy American pig in the movie
He thinks because he has power he can treat and offend those who don't have power and those who aren't around to listen to his offensive remarks.Again backed up by Moore's commentary "This people thought they could be offensive ecause the groups that they were being offensive too weren't there." True cowardism and Moore's shows that too.The movie moves on to show the Union groups attempt to gain their jobs back and get GM to turn the situation around but they fail


One of the reasons they failed is because the Union Managers themselves kept giving concessions to GM, meaningly they gave into GM demands without getting anything in return...

True stupidity.The movie then shows us Moore's attempts to talk to and question the main man behind the GM scandal Roger Smith, the chairman and Ceo of Gm (this old greedy (...) is no longer the head of Gm).Moore's attempts go awry at first, apparently Smith has goons stopping him and people like Ralph Nader from exposing the greedy Smith


Eventually though using the fact that people underestimate him Moore does meet Smith (for 2 minutes basically) before Smith hightails it ouf there and Moore is removed from security from the Gm building at Chrismas no less!!! Where Smith aware of the unemployment, and crime wave hitting the city as a result of the layoffs still seeks to spew his lies and image of Gm into the media.Special Features of the DVD include the original trailerfor the film and an Audio Commentary from Moore himselfin 2003 nearly fifteen years after the release of the movie.

I had other things to do and was a bit annoyed at the interference, but I must say within 10 minutes I was hooked.It is an inspirational film.  Yes it is predictable in some parts but there are a few plot twists.As to the swear words, regrettably I have come to the conclusion that "family movie" no longer means Disney.  I was a bit surprised that they were included, but to remove them would be as inappropriate as removing the "ghetto dialect" used by some of the cast.  Fishburne makes it clear that certain types of language are "inappropriate" in one of the scenes with Keke Palmer.It is up to the parents to instruct their offspring what language is not allowed.Kids swear in the schoolyard.Kids swear because they pick up the language from each other, television, and movies.Parent, go from there and decide how you approach the subject of inappropriate language with your like tykes.But as for the film it is very well done, inspirational, and enjoyable.

$REVIEW.: I have followed the UFO subject since the mid Seventies, and as you look back over the decades there are times in that story line where there were clear milestones, seminal events - that either changed or created awareness about UFO's. I think that years from now folks will look back and see this video as an important event in the history of UFOlogy. I say that for a couple of reasons, first, interest in UFO's was at a fairly low ebb at the time. After the buzz created by some of the abductee stuff of the early 90's and the Phoenix Lights in the late 90's there really wasn't much - in the public domain/consciousness, as it were. This video helped spike public interest again and spawned a lot of spin off programming for the next several years based on its success. Secondly, it pulled together in one place several of the best and most interesting cases, so that when viewed one was hit with a wall - a body of evidence that was extremely compelling. Most UFO programs in the past were rather disjointed, incomplete or spent a vast amount of time speculating or providing air time to the standard debunkers for "balance". This video focused on presenting its "case" in court. And it worked. Divide and conquer is one of the most successful strategies - and it has always been used to squash the case for the reality of UFO's. It is easy to dismiss a case here or a case there. And for the public in general - that may not have an interest or are predisposed not to believe - any individual case is easy to ignore or shoot down, but when they are presented as a whole and with the most credible witnesses then it becomes much harder to reject. James Fox did that with this video. The other thing that is important about this video - is that it is not a "professional" production. That is not a slam against James Fox. That is just the truth. There is no "money" behind this production. I know, I work in the business, and I know what I am looking at. And what I see is one very passionate and dedicated young man with a cheap video camera driven to tell this story - and as a result this individual has made the single most compelling argument for the reality of UFO's. He has earned a place among the giants of the field. His contribution is that important and shows the power and impact that one man can have - if focused, passionate and driven. Be sure to see his follow up to this program - "I Know What I Saw".

Already into witchcraft three friends (Fairuza Bulk, Rachel True and, Neve Campbell) need a forth to complete their circle.. without the completion of their circle they're unable to call the corners (earth, air, fire and, water). When Campbell notices strange behavior from new comer Tunney, she suggests to the other two that Tunney be the forth. As the girls growing interest in witchery develop rapidly.. things begin to heat up and, they realize that they can make things happen. The plot thickens when the girls use their new found powers to get back at classmates that have wrong'd them. As things quickly get out of hand once people start dying, Tunney takes a stand and is left alone to defend herself againist her devilish girlfriends. I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out.. I remember liking it back then and, I liked it after watching it here recently.. that is a sure sign of a decent flick. Though now aged..

$review_text.: I picked this movie up used at a Blockbuster store for $1 and reluctantly sat down to watch it last night.  I was first surprised by the quality of the cinematophraphy and sound (I thought this was going to be a cheaply produced movie, given the first time I was aware of the movie was at the $1 discount bin).  The second thing that hit me was the actors.  Jane looked like a brunette Daryl Hannah (who sounded a little like Tommy Wiseau), Collins looked like a tall Pete Dinklage, and Lydia reminded me of a young post-rhinoplastied Lorainne Newman.  The acting is a mix of adequate to excellent.  I think they did fantastic with their choice of actor for Darcy and the actress who played Elizabeth was personable enough to carry the entire movie.  The only performance that seemed a bit much was the actress who played Lydia -- her performance was broader than the others and would have worked best on the stage, although she does dial it down a bit towards the end of the movie.  As for the movie itself, it is not a perfect movie and Austen fans may be miffed at the changes it makes to the original, even if it is a contemporary retelling of the novel.  There are no Mr. & Ms. Bennets, Jane is not Elizabeth's sister, Kitty is younger than Lydia, Charlette is basically a walk on, Charles Bigley is more buffoonish and Collins' storyline veers onto other grounds.  The movie Bride and Prejudice sticks closer to the original but I also enjoyed how Pride & Prejudice goes off in its own.There are plusses I enjoyed (Charles' dog music commercial for one) and minuses (I thought Mary's song misfired) I didn't but in the end, I'm glad I watched this movie and will definitely watch it again.  I may have only payed $1 for my DVD but for those looking for a different take on the novel, this is definitely recommended.Two quick post scripts, however.  While the movie played without a hitch on my DVD player, it gave me problems getting to the menu screen.  This could just be my DVD player however.  Second is, my favorite adaptation is still by far the 1995 version.  This reviewed DVD should in no way be compared with that version.  This is just a fun variation.

$review_text.: *** 1950. Co-written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. One nomination for the Academy awards (screenplay). In this social film noir, a racist hoodlum, played by Richard Widmark, taxes a black doctor with the murder of his wounded brother and Linda Darnell doesn't know where's the truth. In my opinion, a minor effort in Mankiewicz's filmography. If one can recognize in NO WAY OUT the familiar Mankiewicz theme of the description of a man's humiliation, some dialogues of the film have aged pretty badly. Nevertheless, if you're a fan of this director, you should have this DVD in your library. The quality of the images and the sound is great.

$REVIEW.: With tremendous applause and a standing ovation at the 1994 Eurovision's 7 minute intermission; Michael Flatley, Jean Butler, and an Irish troupe of dancers tapped their way into the record books. It was all that was talked about that night long ago. "Riverdance" was born soon after.The show was filmed at the Point Theater in Dublin, Ireland and the stage there is perfect. The co-ordination and speed of the Irish taps were spectacular to watch as the Riverdance troupe went through their opening number, "Reel Around the Sun". Michael Flatley came out with such speed that he takes in the whole stage. He's got such carisma that he makes you feel he's dancing just for you. Anuna, with the fabulous Kate McMahon, sing songs that are hauntingly beautiful. Maria Pages does her exquisite spanish, "Firedance". She starts out dancing alone, then Michael joins her. (Cute couple to watch) Jean Butler is lovely and a joy to watch in her opening number "The Countess Cathleen"; she has such cute facial expressions! The older women that sings "Lift the Wings" brought shivers down my spine. I just love that song! "Freedom" was done by a gospel choir and I can't forget "The Russian Dervish", which was very colorful; performed by three men and three women, who do some amazing stunts as they twirl through this number. This video came out in 1995; a very dynamic and breathtaking experience. It celebrates Irish dancing at its best. I hope it will be back on the shelf soon so people can experience this presentation of Irish dancing and song. I loved every minute of it.

$review_text.: This Baz Luhrman film is a great epic...the storyline however, doesn't flow at your typical Hollywood-flick pace

Some people stopped watching after fifteen minutes, but the thing about Baz Lurhman is that the first minutes of his films are always kind of strange


I almost walked out of "Moulin Rouge" the first time I saw it in the theatre, it was a good 10-15 minutes before the film settled down from wacky cuts and got down to business
And when it did, it was spectacular

The same applies to this movie.Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are great together, and you can't help but really like the kid who plays "Nala"
If you like movies that are different (specifically, if you like foreign films - they are paced differently) you will love "Australia"


If you loved "Moulin Rouge" - you will love Australia


But if you need instant gratification in your movies, this will be too slow for you.I take one star away because there is only one special feature: Deleted Scenes
I suspect FOX will release "special edition" further down the road will all the extras, and that's greedy BS in my book.

$review_text.: I love this movie with a passion! Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton (and all of the child actors, really) all bring their A-game to make this a perfect treasure-hunt-meets-coming-of-age film.  Director Richard Donner, writer-producer Stephen Spielberg, and screenwriter Chris Columbus all came together to create a true classic full of memorable scenes, quotable quotes, and phenomenal acting on all parts--adults and their child co-stars.Sadly, the initial driving point of the plot (kids going on a treasure hunt to prevent their homes from being foreclosed) is all too familiar to kids these days, who will relate to the desire to find purportedly mythical treasure to keep their homes and neighborhoods safe.The only thing I would caution parents about is the language (lots of "s***" and some inappropriate things said in espa&ntilde;ol)  and scary situations, which I believe would earn The Goonies a PG-13 rating if it were to be released today.

There were many physically endowed candidates that they could have chosen for the super serum program, but they chose the one who had the most heart and love for his country and himself, and unless you are an avid Cap fan, then for the novice hero-lover, this is a good starting point to be introduced to.  As the film came along, action-packed and all, we see the costume and the shield, but throughout, we see the man behind it all, and that made the movie worthwhile.  WAY TO GO, CAP!!

$REVIEW.: "The Search for Santa Paws" is an adorable Christmas DVD for kids and adults of all ages.  The movie is a prequel to the 2009 movie Santa Buddies, which I have never seen and it didn't feel like I was missing anything.  It reminds me of Annie meets Christmas.  The story is about Santa Claus visiting New York City but after an accident he gets amnesia.  Then there is a group of orphans who help out and a husband/wife couple who open a wonderful toy store.  There is so much to this movie and it flows so nicely.  I put this movie on and my boys slowly started paying more and more attention, they are hooked!  I was really amazed that they like this movie since it is not animated but they saw Santa and his cute best friend Paws and couldn't stop watching.The movie tells a tale of believing in Santa and the Christmas Spirit, helping others, and making friends.  It really is a magical movie that I know we will be watching for years to come, as well as probably throughout the year if my boys have anything to do with it!  It is especially a great DVD to get you in the Christmas mood.  I also want to add that you don't have to be a dog lover to enjoy this movie either!

$review_text.: My friend accidentally picked this one up at the rental the other night, and we watched it just for the heck of it. It was horrible. Plotless, pointless, straight-to-video dud about a coven of warlocks at a prep school. There were plot holes the size of the Grand Canyon. There were bad actors. There was obviously a badly written script that the bad actors had to work with. The dialogue was hilarious and stupid, and the scenes that were supposed to be &quot;disturbing&quot; were too dumb to be taken seriously. We just laughed all the way through it. I could easily go outside in my backyard with my video camera and make a better movie than this.Another thing about this bomb was that it ended horribly...but, then again, what can you expect from a piece of crap like this? I've read the director's filmography just for fun, and his earlier work is not very appealing. His name is David DeCoteau, folks, and he just may be the next Ed Wood! I bet when you compare the two, Ed Wood probably looks like Steven Speilberg next to this guy.All in all, this is a movie to avoid, but if your looking for laughs...well...it might be worth a look. *THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR*

$review_text.: Option B- I MAKE YOU go see The Rundown.The Rundown marks the arrival of Dwayne Johnson, A.K.A
"The Rock" as a bona-fide movie star

As Beck, a "Retrieval Expert" who longs for a simpler life as a chef, he displays for the first time on film the humor and charisma that won him "Millions....and MILLIONS!" of fans in the WWE
Dispatced to the South American town of El Dorado (Called Hell Dorado by the locals) to fetch Travis Walker (Seann William Scott), the wayward son of his shady boss, Beck gets more than he bargained for

He finds Travis easily enough, but getting him home might pose more of a problem


Not only does Travis not WANT to go home, but local land baron Hatcher (The hilariously nutty Christopher Walken, at his eye-popping best here) won't LET him go...At least not until Travis finds a mythical golden idol for him
The Rock vs

an army of gun-toting slave-drivers......Place your bets!As I said earlier, The Rock is awesome in his role, bringing a mix of self-effacing humor and quiet strength to the mix, balancing out the potentially irritating Scott's whiny character

Walken is, as always, a joy to watch

His diatribe about The Tooth Fairy is worth the price of admission alone, and hearing him say "Oompa-Loompa" is sure to go down in history as one of my all-time favorite movie lines


Director Peter Berg shows himself to be equally comfortable with comedy and action; He keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace, and the action scenes are simply stunning- Not only are the fights choreographed beautifully, but the action is easy to follow, with none of the choppy editing and shaky photography that has ruined many an action movie.The Rundown is just what it portrays itself as: A fun buddy picture
I had a blast, and so did everyone else in the theater
If you're in the mood for action, The Rundown is a sure bet

If you smell what I'm cookin'.....

$review_text.: I have a standing rule not to pay more than $23 for any Blu-ray movie (no need to encourage Hollywood marketeers). That said, I broke that rule for this movie after hearing an interview with the writer and producer on NPR (National Public Radio) then discovered that this disc was worth every penny. One thing you will come away with is the fact that there were many similarities between life in 1859 and today. For example, people of both times were split between theism, deism, and atheism. (Contrary to popular belief, Darwin was somewhere between deist and theist). So does "Darwin's Theory do away with God" as Huxley said, or does it "replace the Genesis story with something more pragmatic"? I prefer to believe that later but you should make up your own mind.

The film is best seen after the "Black Pearl" episode and I should think, other episodes.Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom return but can't do much in the land of the dead, where romance is more or less for the living and that subtracts from the overall entertainment value of this flick.The two disc Limited Edition set is beautifully encased and the second disc includes bloopers and deleted scenes.And that's about it.

$REVIEW.: Iraq in Fragments accurately describes not only the moving documentary by James Longley, but also the current political and social situation in the middle eastern country. Presented in three parts - Sunni, Shia, and Kurdish - Iraq in Fragments is a documentary set apart from the rest. Winning Best Documentary Cinematography, Best Documentary Editing, and Best Documentary Director at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, Iraq in Fragments has the official Sundance sanction of being a little better made than the rest of the current documentaries about the war-torn country of Iraq.Presenting Iraqis in a very human and unbiased way, Iraq in Fragments starts out with the intense portrait of a young Sunni boy named Mohammed who has been "adopted" by a garage owner who mistreats, verbally abuses, and mocks the poor child. His life is examined in detail as he goes from work to school and back again. Listening to the older Sunni men discuss the American occupation around the back door of the garage is akin to listening to American men discuss the war on a back porch next to a barbeque pit. Their opinions may simply be their opinions but they are given ample time to discuss them and the audience is given ample opportunity to digest them.Part two is devoted to the examination of Shia Sadr followers in two cities as they prepare for elections. An extremely intimate portrayal of Shia "death squads", as they have been called in the American news, shows the Iraqi police as they arrest men for allegedly selling alcohol in a town market. How Longley managed to get the footage he has is anybody's guess. Risking life and limb for the proper shots, Longley is able to present an Iraq few may have ever seen, though several non-fiction books have mentioned the circumstances portrayed.The final chapter focuses on the Kurdish farmers of Iraq, who welcome the American forces and celebrate the  replacement of Saddam. The focus of this chapter is on a young Kurdish boy who dreams of being a doctor some day. This section of the film, entitled Kurdish Spring, is the most moving and ultimately upbeat portion of the film, and marks a good choice for the final piece of the fragmented Iraqi portrait.Throughout the film, Longley opts for intimate stories of individuals rather than a broad portrayal of all of Iraq, and he succeeds on all accounts. This may leave some viewers slightly confused, however, as each section is not properly introduced as Sunni, Shia, or Kurdish. Iraq in Fragments is a film dedicated to the educated viewer, and those who have done their research on Iraq will surely appreciate the individually honest portraits that Longely has painted here. For well studied filmgoers, Iraq in Fragments offers the kind of inside view of a wartorn country that we have been waiting for. The story is not bogged down or enmeshed in a narrator's diaglogue, designed to sway the viewer's opinion in any direction; the footage is simply displayed as is. Longley spent upwards of two years in Iraq gathering this footage, and it was well worth the while. For a true portrait of each of the three sections of Iraq, Iraq in Fragments can't be topped.

$REVIEW.: I first saw The Shining about ten years ago, and was not impressed

The acting was awful, and it lurched from scene to scene without any transition or even resemblence to a plot

It made me run out and purchase the book, because it had to be better than this lousy excuse for a movie

And I was right


It is, without question, the most terrifying novel I have ever read

No longer did I dismiss the film as just another bad Kubrick film (and let's face it, he made quite a few); I now saw it as an abomination

This mini-series, however, does a much better job of adapting Stephen King's classic tale

It isn't perfect, but it is scarier (and more violent!) than the 1980 turkey that disgraced movie screens.

$REVIEW.: I like &#34;Justified&#34; a lot, but I started watching during the second season.  I was delighted when Prime included the first season.  The first season, I find, is a lot more &#34;Elmore Leonard-y&#34; than the later ones.  The episodes are more self-contained; although there is also a season-long story arc it's not the only thing going on.  Most of the weekly plots are about crimes by not-exactly sane people. The bad guys, and sometimes the good guys too, get their eye so glued to the prize they lose all peripheral vision.  And there are a few laughs to be had before everything goes into the wood-chipper, as in many of Leonard's books.

A man running in a bunny suit stalking teenagers. Although they don't show the killings, it's more than implied with the amount of bloodshed splattering all over and it does seem very realistic the way they do it. I read some negative reviews before watching this and was worried but I was very pleasantly surprised. I loved it. I could watch this movie over and over just for the entertainment factor alone. The movie doesn't really drag either like a lot of other B rated movies I have watched- it really moves along and I really enjoyed the extras too. It's loaded with TONS of extras which makes the price totally worth it. I am really looking forward to Bunnyman 2. Can't wait!

$REVIEW.: This series is pure enjoyment.  It is well written, humorous, thoughtful, and beautifully filmed.  No, it's not shot like a current 'modern' series, but I actually find that a relief.  This is more focused on the characters, rather than on 'flash bang' or 'research display' modes that so much of 'modern' tv is.  My mother and sisters pile in to watch episodes with me and we have all really loved it.  It has all the 'adult' issues a series set in that time would have--dangers of rape, torture, murder, loss of loved ones, bitter decisions, struggle to just stay alive/make a go of it, etc.--but without the ugliness of graphic shots to show them.  More substance than just going for the shock value you get in CSI and such.  I really enjoy how the characters are developed--their facial expressions, mannerisms, interactions, etc., all come together to make for people you fully enjoy being a part of.  They are capable of foolishness, hardness, kindness, humor, heroism, or villainy all in turns.  I have laughed hard on some of their interactions--like the Captain's outraged &#34;Elizabeth!&#34; when she admits to having resorted to hiding rifles, powder and shot--and her equally mixed defiant and humored defense of it--she wouldn't have to if he would curb his tendency to repeatedly confiscate them at every emergency!  I am honestly very glad that I bought it--and will definitely re-watch it often.  I really wish there were a bazillion seasons of this to purchase, but like Wonder Woman and Firefly, some awesomeness is just available in tiny bits, sigh.This series gets better and better with each episode--I am more than happy with adding this to my collection.  In the midst of crime dramas, sci-fi serials, and supernatural runs, there is something completely delightful with moving back in time to a world that is both utterly familiar and completely different at the same time.  Well worth your time.

As the title track is playing, hordes of screaming young girls chase the Beatles through the train station, cutting back and forth to a man's attempts to open a milk carton, Paul and his grandfather calmly waiting the storm out, and finally all the Beatles escaping aboard the train.The musical numbers demonstrate spontaneity of bursting into song "I Should Have Known Better" and "I'm Happy Just To Dance With You."  They are just plain enjoying themselves.  And "Can't Buy Me Love," featuring their antics on the grass pitch, can be construed as the first ever music video.  The aerial camera angles, the guys clowning around, and the speeded up camera shots add to the fun.  "And I Love Her" is highlighted by the light effect around Paul's face at the end of the number.  First, half his face is shaded, the other in light.  The camera swings to a profile shot, first flooding his face so it can't be seen, then fading to a thin corona, making an eclipse effect.  Great cinematography work there.The press conference has Paul's repeated answers:  "No, we're just good friends," plus John's witty remark to how they found America:  "Turn left at Greenland."Ringo's misadventures when he goes out parading is also of worthy mention.  and even establishes a brief but good rapport with Charlie, the boy who's playing hookie from school.  The scene in the cafe is good as well.George has a great moment in a scene demonstrating how mass marketing and teen trends are set.  I kind of wonder if this is how things still work today.Other great moments:  a Keystone cops-inspired chase scene, the carjacker, George showing Shake how to shave, John playing in the bath--believe me, there are so many scenes worth mentioning it'd be impossible to list them all--the movie's THAT good.Of the two schoolgirls in the train, the blonde is Patty Boyd, later to be George Harrison's first wife, later to marry Eric Clapton.  David Langton, the actor in the dressing room reacting to John's long beard, is best known as Lord Bellamy in Upstairs Downstairs.  Lionel Blair, the choreographer of the "Tell Me Why" dance routine, appeared in Absolute Beginners as Harry Charms.  Richard Vernon, the stuffy newspaper reading man aboard the train, had many roles in TV, including Yes Minister.  And the tall gangly man jumping up and down in the club with Ringo is Jeremy Lloyd, one of the co-creators of Are You Being Served? (!)Other supporting characters include Norm, as their bossy, height-challenged PR man who's fighting a war of nerves with John, and Shake, his towering but unassertive assistant on whom he takes out his frustrations.  Shake tells him, "John hasn't got any [nerves]"  Norm:  "That's just the trouble."But let's not forget Wilfrid Brambell as Paul's "clean" grandfather, who's got a wily look in his eye.  He's an instigator, all right, stirring things up, "a mixer," as Paul calls him.  The scene where he gets more chips after he goes broke at the gambling club shows how foxy he can be.  He successful stirs up Ringo, nearly sabotaging the live performance.The final music montage featuring "Tell Me Why," "If I Fell," "I Should've Known Better," and "She Loves You" demonstrates the triumph of the Beatles.  And look at the hysterical to love-stricken faces of their feminine audience!  What an effect they had on their fans!The rock movie would not have been possible without this day in the life of the Beatles movie.  This also shows the band in their early days, when they were fresh, getting along with each other.  And if you don't like this movie, well, to quote John, "you're a swine."

$review_text.: It's really virtually impossible not to like a movie with Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson in it.. they add a sense of gravitas to anything they are in - and there is pleasure to be had in watching their contrasting styles spark off each other.Here, the play two men, both suffering from cancer, sharing a room at a hospital (in a rather contrived set up).  After some preamble to fleetingly show that they are actually not well, they create a bucket list - a list of things they want to do before kicking the bucket, and since one of them is rich, set out to work their way through the items, learning about themselves and each other as they go.It works because the leads are strong, particularly Freeman.  Nicholson overplays, but then the writing does call for it.  It does stumble however in the script department from time to time... For example, Freeman talking to Nicholson - "You once said you're not everyone. Well, that's true-you're certainly not everyone, but everyone is everyone."  It's not exactly Shakespeare.  The concept of terminally ill men skydiving, climbing mountains and traveling the world somewhat while barely catching their breath also stretches credibility.  Morgan Freeman does his trademark stately voice over, which only serves to remind you of The Shawshank Redemption, and the comparison is not favourable.  And while the male bonding is fun to watch and some of the one-liners funny, the warmth of affection Freeman narrates for the Nicholson character never seems quite justified by anything his character does.Those quibbles aside, it's fun, warm and fuzzy round the edges, has some decent performances, and is short enough not to outlast its welcome.  Not a classic, but thumbs up nonetheless.

$review_text.: Expecting a bleak experience this was surprisingly funny, to the extent they could have got away with billing it as a comedy. Rylance delivers the goods (fnar,fnar) and Marion Faithfull does some acting too. Lurches from vulgar realism to melodrama and finally to some curious and somewhat unwarranted arthouse obtuseness. What was all that waffle about "what was it like when you died?"The explicitness rather defeats the whole point of acting. Cue boring anecdote about Olivier and Hoffman on the set of 'Marathon Man'? Nah, I'll let you off. Did we need the one for the road? Maybe it was a rare authentic moment but I questioned why the director wanted me to stand by the door watching. Five seconds of truth is still truth. Presumably the actors were paid for their endeavours which beggars uncomfortable ethical questions about prostitution.

$REVIEW.: Be warned, I saw this in the theatre, so I have no idea what "goodies" the DVD will include, so I can only really give my opinion on the movie itself.That being said, I thought this movie was pretty good.  But, if you are expecting a comic book movie adaptation on the par with Spider-man or X-men, then you will be disappointed.  Think more along the lines of Daredevil, good but not spectacular.  It seemed to pick good parts from various popular comic book storylines and then "hollywood cheesed" it up a bit.  If you read the comics and have seen this movie or Daredevil, you'll know exactly what I am talking about.  Don't get me wrong, I went and saw this movie as a MOVIE and not as a faithful adaptation of the comic book.  It was good, just not great.  I was entertained, and I guess thats all I can ask for.  I just had a problem with the way that Travoltas character died, and really wasn't happy with his character portrayal in general.  Normally, I really like him as an actor, but this movie he just seemed... stiff, for lack of a better word.  The real shining star of this movie, however, is Thomas Jayne, who did a fantastic job in the lead role of Frank Castle (aka the Punisher).  I had never really heard of him before this, but he was superb.If you have never read any of the great "Punisher" comics in your life, you will still enjoy this movie as a good action flick.  But for you fanboys out there, it heavily revamps his origin and then borrows alot from Garth Ennis recent storylines from his Punisher mini series that came out a few years ago.  By the way, you should pick up his new ongoing Punisher series out now, it's great, but I digress.So all in all, it's not a bad popcorn flick.  Good action, pretty good storyline, some dark humor thrown in there, a little suspense, and the acting was not bad (I just hope this movie doesn't re-kill Travoltas career).  Defintely worth renting at least once, and then you can decide for yourself.  I will definitely pick this one up when it comes out in September.
$SUMMARY.: Pretty good movie for some...

$review_text.: First off, I've just got to say, I loved Wolf's Rain


This series is beautiful


From the animation to the music to the plot


Everything is wonderful..


I especially loved the end to this series

Here's why


(and I won't spoil much, so it's safe to read)The first half of the series really pulled me in
It caught my attention and held it


But when I started to watch this, I really could not stop, I watched this in one sitting
The last few episodes were incredible


True, there was a certain ambiguity to the ending, but all in all, everything was wrapped up nicely
As you learn more about the pasts of the wolves, Cheza, and the other characters and as they search out Paradise, things really start to fall apart

While watching this, you'll be wondering, will they find Paradise, what cost will they have to pay to get there? And you'll find out


You may not like the end, but I actually found it to be very beautiful.The only thing I'll spoil is this, you'll probably need a kleenex or two...the last 5 or so episodes had me in tears nonstop.Even so, I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone willing to watch it

It's great.

$SUMMARY.: Stunning series....

$REVIEW.: &quot;Duets&quot; is certainly a very likable film, and to watch its  stars singing makes me feel good, but wait a minute, don't you forget something?That is, everybody does karaoke for fun.  Remember, &quot;Duets&quot; is not the first movie that shows the Hollywood stars sing a karaoke song; Cameron Diaz sang twice in &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding&quot; and &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot; respectively and on both occasions we had a really tremendous fun to see her sing (very badly).  See, nobody wants to see a singer die on the stage, no matter how the script requires him to do so.In this respect, I mean fun, &quot;Duets&quot; takes the subject matter too seriously, and makes us wonder why they must find their meaning of life in such a way, repeatedly participating in karaoke contests.  All the cast sing very well, and Gwyneth Paltrow even amazed me with her singing voice, but they did not need to surprise us that way.  Poor singing is OK in karaoke as long as you have a good time, and that is what karaoke is all about.  And that is the reason Paul Giamatti &amp; Andre Braugher duet of &quot;Try A Little Tenderness&quot; moves our heart most.  They are having fun, and we know it.  But the rest of the film remains just another ordinary descriptions of characters.

$review_text.: I got this movie for one reason - Amy Adams was so thrilling in "Enchanted" and "Talledega Nights" that I looked up some of her other movies.This was her first movie, playing the character of Leslie Miller, the oversexed, airheaded cheerleader who came in third (second runner-up -"I came in second!" - "No, you came in third!") in the beauty pageant of this mockumentary.It's a different character from the earnest goodness of her more recent roles as Giselle in "Enchanted", Susan in "Talledega nights", and Ashley in "Junebug", but you can still see her total enthusiasm come through.  It was this movie, filmed locally in Minnesota, that got her out of doing dinner theater in Minnesota and on her way to Hollywood.The movie is also interesting as a flashback on the careers of so many other actresses.Kirsten Dunst was only 17 when this movie was released, and was transitioning from the child actress Claudia in "Inteview with the Vampire" to meatier teenage roles and was on the verge of stardom with the Spider-man franchise.Kirstie Alley had gone from her "Cheers" leading lady days and in this movie was well on her way to her "Fat Actress" future.Denise Richards - yet another role where she did a good job but didn't really shine through as a super star.Brittany Murphy - almost unrecognizable in this movie as the wholesome brunette Lisa Swenson who drops out to give Kirsten Dunst's character a chance in the contest - Murphy would later do a whole series of sexy blonde roles, including Shellie in "Sin City".Ellen Barkin - she would go straight from this movie to becoming the wife of billionaire Ron Perelman, then divorce in 2006.As for the movie itself - cute, funny, and sardonic.  Not much else to add on top of all of the other reviews here.Next on the Amy Adams tour - Cruel Intentions 2!  Talk about a totally different role!

$REVIEW.: I give the WONDER WOMAN TWO-DVD SET a generous 5-stars because I'm glad this favorite super hero of mine, finally gets the recognition she deserves with her own animated movie.That's not to say that this movie or the updated character of Wonder Woman is without flaws.The action and the animation is really good, but as some other reviewers noted some scenes are graphic showing blood and killings, and so if you have small kids it might disturb them. I thought that those scenes were appropriate, but I'm an adult.And I found the story a little odd as well because the big battle happens between the amazons, Ares (the God Of War), and mythological creatures, and it all takes place in the present day in Washington D.C., at some very historical sites like the Vietnam Memorial wall and the Lincoln Memorial. But all of the modern people are absent from these scenes, including reporters, so that was very strange. I kept wondering where are the people? Where are the reporters? Where are the looky-loos with their camera phones?Another pet-peeve was during the contest they didn't show "bullets and bracelets," which was part of the amazon competition to find who would be the emissary to escort Trevor back to "man's world," but they did show WW deflecting bullets when she comes into the city. And they don't show how Diana becomes WW, she's basically wearing the costume under her clothes like Superman. Boring! They should have done the spin or the lasso from the comics, to get her into her costume.And the character herself seemed a little aloof. I was introduced to Wonder Woman through the Lynda Carter TV seriesWonder Woman - The Complete First Seasonand I read the comics during the 70s and 80s, but Carter's characterization is so firmly cemented in my brain and that might be why I find this character a little distant. Steve Trevor was a little annoying, too. But those are small problems.Other than that, the movie is cool and the extras are worth it.On DVD #2 you get:=== Wonder Woman: A Subversive Dream--(25:25-Minutes)===Discusses how creator Marston got the idea for Wonder Woman and how the comic book character has influenced pop culture.=== Wonder Woman: Daughter Of Myth-- (25:35-Minutes) ===Talks about the evolution of Wonder Woman from the Greek Myths to the television series with Lynda Carter.Also includes two Justice League cartoons "To Another Shore" and "Hawk and Dove" that both feature Wonder Woman as the lead character.I hope that another WW DVD will be coming out soon.

$review_text.: Anyone who has ever dismissed Ronald Reagan as a "B-movie" actor has only to see him in "King's Row" to realize that he was perfectly capable of being an "A-movie" actor


In Reagan's case, I do not think that it was a question of mediocre talent but rather of having the right material and the kind of director who could command a superb performance
Sam Wood was one such director, and the 1942 film, based upon Henry Bellaman's novel of the same name, afforded the dramatic setting in which Reagan could shine.Set in a small Missouri town in the early 1900's, "King's Row" explores many issues which have come to haunt modern times, specifically the power and authority of the medical profession over people's lives
It emphasizes that being a physician is a vocation in which the highest integrity is absolutely indispensable
Without a moral compass, the medical profession is doomed to barbarity.In spite of the idyllic appearance of the town, it is haunted by a sadistic doctor who sees himself ordained to punish sinners, as long as the sinners in question are too poor and obscure to defend themselves

Ronald Reagan portrays "Drake," the charming, lackadaisical rascal of the town, whom the sadist Dr
Gordon (Charles Coburn) chooses to castigate in a particularly grotesque manner
Reagan's interpretation of Drake's response to the horror which befalls him is one of the most powerful moments in classic cinema.Drake is the boyhood friend of the protagonist "Parris," played by Robert Cummings, and the brotherly bond between them is a beautiful portrayal of true friendship
Meanwhile, the neurotic women in their lives bring with them situations fraught with dark secrets, except for Parris' grandmother (Maria Ouspenskaya) and Drake's girlfriend (Ann Sheridan) who bring hope and balance
The Ann Sheridan character "Randy Monaghan" is supposed to be Catholic, and the scene in which she murmurs "O Blessed Mother of God!" is profoundly moving.Ultimately, Parris, who becomes a doctor himself, is faced with a moral dilemma in which he must choose to use his medical credentials to save or to destroy


His new friend, a lovely Viennese girl, leads him to the light, and the darkness which threatens to overwhelm the characters is overcome.

$REVIEW.: Bill Owen's last season ends with a poignant special called "Last Pigeon and Post".  He would not live to participate in Season 21.Bill insisted on trying to complete all filming.  In fact, he was not able to complete all the filming for the final special.  The producers of the show were forced to use his double for some scenes and to electronically drop his image into some others.  I think they did a seamless job.Some of the most touching images in the show feature a frail Compo sitting alone and looking completely disheartened.  The extreme close-ups of Bill Owen's eyes illustrate just how ill the actor was at this point.Compo's friends and neighbors take up a collection to send him on a vacation to France, to re-visit the country where he served in WWII.  The whole cast show ups to cheer him on his way.  He even gets an  unsolicited farewell kiss from Nora Batty!In France, compo searches through the country side, looking for the spot where he and his buddies were penned down by the Germans.  Once there, Compo takes out his bugle and plays "Last Post", the U.K. military's equivalent of the U.S. military's "Taps" in remembrance of his comrades of long ago.No one who loves this show will be able to watch Bill Owen's farewell performance with dry eyes.I think you will enjoy this vocal version of the Last of the Summer Wine theme:[...](If the line above does not display as a link, just copy it and paste it into your web address line.)Here is a listing of the DVD contents:DISC 1:1.

$review_text.: There is nothing special about this movie.It has your by the numbers 50's horror script and the make-up effects are only slighty better than a complete disaster.But I still enjoyed this picture for two reasons in particular:One being the performance of the lead,Arthur Franz.This guy was stuck with some poor dialogue and a script full of plot holes but he delivers his lines with such conviction that its much easier to forgive the films faux pas'.My other reason is the direction of Jack Arnold.MOTC is the sixth film I've purchased from this director and there is not one in the bunch that I dont recommend.Jack always manages to squeeze every last bit of entertainment value out of the movies he works on.He hasnt always had the best material to work from but they're always fun.He has a way of capturing images that stick in your head long after the picture is over.As for the rest of the movie,the cast is good except for Troy Donahue who plays a very minor role anyway.And the script moves at a brisk pace and chooses excitement over logic which suited me just fine.Once in a while a movie succeeds despite its flaws(see my review of Earth Vs The Flying Saucers).This is one such picture.This movie will make you chuckle rather than groan and you wont be looking at the clock to see if its almost over.Its by no means a classic by for 10 bucks its a worthy purchase.In case your wondering,the other Jack Arnold movies that I recommend seeing are:The Incredible Shrinking Man,Creature From The Black Lagoon,Revenge Of The Creature,Tarantula,and It Came From Outer Space.

$review_text.: BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES is the fifth movie in the PLANET OF THE APES series


It's a decent movie, but could have been much better with a bigger budget.The movie takes place several years after the ape revolt and after mankind has almost destroyed itself by nuking cities around the world

Caesar has established an ape city several miles outside of what was once New York City
In Ape City, apes and men coexist but not as equals
Men are subservient to apes and Caesar says it will stay that way until he can trust the &#34;race of man&#34;, not just a few individual humans


The climax of the film occurs when mutants attack Ape City in an attempt to reestablish human supremacy.The movie itself is an average 1970s film


The movie illustrates how the apes were just as destructive as humans
However, this latest edition of BATTLE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES tries to rewrite the Apes mythos by leaving out a crucial scene


This version of the film leaves out the scene where the remaining mutants begin worshiping the Doomsday Bomb that destroys the world at the end of BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES
This version of the movie ends with a scene of The Lawgiver teaching to a group of ape and human children leaving the viewer believing that history had been changed, when in actuality it had not.Overall, an average movie, but the weakest of the APES movies.

$REVIEW.: This film has its sweet and sour parts, like the delicious Chinese dish. The story centers around 3 Gay Chinese men, age 40, who used to be close friends during their college years. The pivotal character, Gavin, dies early in the film, leaving his two friends to re-examine their own lives. Mel, the Club Stud has a fear of growing old and losing his looks and thus his ability to attract sex partners for casual encounters. He feels as long as he carries on his hedonistic lifestyle of a young man in his 20s, dyed and buff and botoxed, he will not grow old. I found his character to be totally unlikeable; he is a jerk to Todd, a young man who wants nothing more than a monogamous relationship with Mel. Mel treats him like dirt, to be tossed aside when somebody hotter comes along. Perhaps settling down with one person reminds Mel too much of getting older.What I really disliked was the outcome of Todd's character. Initially he is successful in the fashion world and he does get his digs into Mel at the end (deserving, I might add), but then winds up a male prostitute. I suppose that's was meant for comedy, but to me it was a disservice to a young man who only wanted to be loved and settle into a serious relationship.  This character deserved better.The funniest and sweetest scenes were with Ash, a soft-spoken, demure swish who is looking for "Mr. Right." His attempts to find a partner is both touching and hilarious. He tries cross-dressing to attract a more butch, straight-acting partner and ends up with Ross, the ex-boyfriend of a cross-dressing friend. Their relationship has its ups and downs, and interestingly, Ash re-enacts the "cut sleeve" poem with Ross, though for different reasons. He too, is going through the difficulty of growing old, though he is able to come to terms with it. Poor Mel never does.Hilarious too, were the scenes of Gavin's funeral, where Mel tries to flirt with the priest delivering the eulogy, and Gavin's fiancee, giving an impassioned speech about Gavin's talent in dress design, going so far as to model one of his creations, "a complete original", only to see a drag queen friend of Gavin's wearing the same dress. Another funny scene is the reading of Gavin's will.Ash does find happiness, which is quite satisfying. I won't give anything more away, but I do recommend this film, because there's a charm about it.
$SUMMARY.: A Sweet & Sour Film...Bit of a Mixed Bag

$REVIEW.: When it comes to horror movies, less is more -- the less you show, the more scares you have

And "The Legend of Hell House" is an excellent example of that, with the scares being filtered through eerie acting, weird poultergeisty occurrences, and horrible tales of the past
The downside: it all falls apart (literally) at the ending.A weird old millionaire hires physicist Lionel Barrett (Clive Revill) to prove the existence of life after death, by sending him to "the one place where it has yet to be refuted" (which doesn't make logical sense since you cannot confirm or deny that, but who watches horror for logic?).The place in question is the Belasco House, once owned by a vast sadistic pervert who had orgies and massacres and so on at the house

 Along with his wife Ann (Gayle Hunnicutt), Barrett brings mental medium Florence Tanner (Pamela Franklin) and physical medium Ben Fischer (Roddy McDowall), but he's convinced that he can use a machine to flush the negative electromagnetic energy out of the house.Of course, it's not that easy -- Florence becomes close to the erratic ghost of the owner's dead son, while Fischer is struggling with memories of a ghastly expedition to the same house that he barely survived

Possessions, attacks and sinister secrets all come to the surface, and not all of them will come out alive."The Legend of Hell House" is creepy


Very creepy

Lots of slow-moving, eerie scenes that are propelled mainly by atmosphere and the actors, and punctuated with shrieks and the occasional spurt of violence (Florence gets attacked by a possessed cat)
It unwinds slowly with hints and clues about what's going on, and slowly building up to some shocking twists.Additionally, the actors are magnificent

Revill is excellent as a stuffy, rather rude guy who thinks that the mediums are superstitious losers, and Hunnicutt has a few good scenes as a "wanton sleepwalker." But the best performances are by Franklin as a naive, religious young girl, and McDowell as a man tortured by the past.So what goes wrong with this movie? Well, it comes unraveled in the last few scenes


Suddenly Roddy McDowall is yelling and posing and getting blown around


And of course, the Big Revelation is..

less than bone-chilling


You're more likely to just go, "What, that was the twist?""The Legend of Hell House" is a haunting, eerie movie that centers on four excellent actors, but the tension and creepiness basically disintegrate at the end

However, it's still a horror classic worth scaring yourself with.

$SUMMARY.: Ghostliness all around

$REVIEW.: OK, now we all know that this is like the best movie ever made, right???  Good, then I don't have to go into the movie at all.  That leaves me time to discuss this new blu-ray collector's set of the best damn movie ever filmed.  Let's get started as if we're just opening this box set.Outer box:As soon as you get the plastic wrap off, you're going to want to rub your hands along the smooth red velvet that covers the entire box.  You'll notice the title "Gone With the Wind" embossed in gold foil along all four sides of the box, and the front is a recessed image from the famous burning of Atlanta scene with the words, "Gone With the Wind" in raised gold lettering.  Just the outer box is enough to illicit a slight gasp.Opening the lid:Now let's lift the hinged lid, and what's that I see???? The lid is secured to opening no greater than a 90 degree angle with two black strap that are attached to the lid and the inside of the bottom tray.  Oh! my my!!  Who's that I see??  Why fiddle dee dee, it's Scarlet O'hara herself gracing the inside lid with a beautiful photo from the set showing her sitting on a fence in a white belle gown, with Tara in the background.  Now our eyes are drawn to what is actually inside the box.Inside the box:We look down to see a hardcover book with a black cover showing Rhett, Scarlett, and Tara in silhouette with the sky shaded a blazing orange and red.  The book is a top notch production with glorious black and white and color photos throughout.  There are also lots of concept drawings, costumed designs, and behind-the-scenes illustrations.  Now we lifts a black ribbon on the side which lifts the book and the other extra contents out of the box.  Now we see the reproduction of the original program given out at the premiere.  Now if you have the 4-disc DVD collector's set, this is the same reproduction as enclosed there with the nice exception of being full sized. The larger size really adds to the quality of this program.  The other printed bonuses may or may not appeal to some.  What you'll find is a collection of different communiques between the filmmakers and the various production agents.  It does provide some interesting insight into the feelings about the movie as it was in production.The Meat:OK, now we finally get to what we bought this for in the first place.  Oh.....wait......I really did want all the previous stuff, so I guess for some this may just be the icing on the cake.  The final two items in the set are a CD sampler and the blu-ray edition of the movie.  The CD Sampler is housed in a very handsome CD case, and clocks in at a little over 30 minutes of Alex North's wonderful soundtrack for this film.  It leaves you wanting more, but it's a nice addition to the set.  Now for the final course....the movie.  The movie is on one blu-ray disc, and the picture is absolutely stunning.  I've never seen this movie look so fresh and vibrant.  Warner should get an award for their recent remastering of some classic films; Casablanca, and Wizard of Oz to name a few.  The sound here will leave you breathless.  The orchestral score at the beginning and throughout sounds better than I've ever heard it.  There is no edition that you currently own that can come close to the quality of the newly remastered high-def image and sound.  There is another blu-ray disc full of supplemental material.  I believe that all of the content from the 4-disc DVD is included here.  There may be something missing, but it appeared to be everything to me.  Even if there is something missing, you won't miss it, because there are three hours worth of new extra features that are included here for the first time.  First is a great documentary that originally aired on TCM, called "1939: Hollywoood's Greatest Year".  If you missed out on the original broadcast, here's your chance to see this wonderful documentary.  It truly is amazing how many classic films were released during this year.  You also get a new featurette titled, "Gone With the Wind: The Legend Lives On".  Finally, there is a made for TV movie "The Scarlett O'Hara War" that dramatizes the search for an actress to play Scarlett.Finally:As if we don't already have enough to warrant purchase, we are presented with 10 watercolor 5 x 7 cards of different production shots.  Each of these is printed on quality stock, and is worthy of being framed.WHEW!!!!!!  OK, that's about it.  Any collector of classic films owes it to himself to get this stunningly beautiful collector's set.  The quality of everything enclosed will leave you stunned.  You definitely get your money's worth with this set.  Bravo to Warner for presenting this very important film in a way that exudes quality and class.

$REVIEW.: Arthur Conan Doyle's greatest creation--and the world's most famous detective-- comes to sparkling life in this chilling, quasi-supernatural whodunit, thanks to the wonderfully talented Basil Rathbone. Of course, there are snappy performances all around from an excellent supporting cast that includes Bruce, Greene, Lionel Atwill (as a family friend), John Carradine (as a queer butler), and Wendy Barrie (as Henry's love interest). Rathbone and Bruce's rapport, however, has come to overshadow all subsequent Holmes-Watson actor pairings. Lanfield's quick-paced "Hound" is one of their most thrilling outings (there are 13 in all!), especially with the foggy English moors providing a splendidly ominous atmosphere.

It's strange how although the theme of The Beauty and The Beast portrayed here and it's predictable out come can still be entertaining. The male lead is quite convincing in his maddness and the story is good. The film quality is good, and a nude Vanity is always good but what you'll enjoy mostly is that it's funny too.

$REVIEW.: Norman Jewison's "Moonstruck" is a Romantic Comedy that stands above almost all in that genre.  The cast, first of all, is a marvel, made up for the most part of character actors, but these are not bit players.  Olympia Dukakis, for example, as the Italian mother Rose, won the Academy Award for supporting actress here.  In the lead as Loretta Castorini, Cher also won her Oscar.  Their performances are astonishingly good, but they are surrounded by a dozen other performances that make this film live and breathe.Thirty-something, Loretta lives at home with Rose and father Cosmo, played brilliantly by Vincent Gardenia and grandfather, played by Italian treasure Feodor Chaliapin.  In the opening scene long-time boyfriend Johnny Cammareri, played by Danny Aiello, proposes to Loretta in the neighborhood restaurant where everyone knows everyone.  Loretta has scarcely had a moment to agree before Johnny tells her that he must return to his mother's death-bed in Italy and for her to ask his estranged brother Ronny to come to the wedding.Loretta finds Ronny slaving over a basement bakery, still fuming that he lost his girl years ago because Brother Johnny distracted him and Ronny lost his hand in a bread slicer.  Ronny is bigger than life, like one of the characters from the operas he loves, full of passions both good and bad.  He is so distracted from his lost love and hate for his brother he doesn't notice the cute girl in the bakery is gone on him.  Loretta performs her duties and asks Ronny to the wedding.The Loretta in the early part of the film is a wallflower, and you get the idea that she accepts Johnny's proposal because she doesn't think she'll get a better (or perhaps another) offer.  The operatically unhappy Ronny is nonetheless passionate, and he awakens something in Loretta while Johnny is away.Romantic comedies are often not very much of either.  The romances are often superficial and paper-thin, and the comedy is as likely to produce a groan as a chuckle.  "Moonstruck" benefits from a sparkling Oscar-winning screenplay by John Patrick Shanley.  It is both romantic, with vivid lusty characters, and it is funny, with lines that could have been written by Quentin Tarantino on a good day, and I mean that in a good way.Gardenia is having an affair with a younger woman, played by Anita Gillette, and their cuddly moments aren't lovey-dovey, but about how masterful Gardenia the plumber is at talking clients into using copper piping.  "I only use copper pipes.  Sure, it costs more.  It costs more because it SAVES more!"  Rose knows Cosmo is having the affair, and you know it bothers her.  She asks Johnny why men have affairs.  "Because they fear death," Johnny replies, and Rose seizes the answer as if heaven sent. "That's IT!"  Rose catches Cosmo sneaking in later and rather than having a bawling hissy-fit or smacking him, she tells him "I just want you to know that no matter what you do, you're still gonna die! Just like everyone else!"Side characters make up much of the charm and beauty of this excellent film.  Julie Bovasso and Louis Guss play Loretta's aunt and uncle, and although they look past their sexual prime, they still share glances and tender touches that let you know the embers are not cold yet.  John Mahoney has a pitiful, funny, sad but wise part as a college professor who specializes in seducing young college girls with his academic wisdom, but winds up getting drinks tossed in his face at the restaurant where Johnny proposes to Loretta.  On one of the nights when Rose knows Cosmo is out having his affair, Rose goes to the restaurant alone and meets the professor as he dries off the latest drink-in-the-face.  This meeting could have gone many different ways, but it goes in a way that allows both characters to come away without losing their dignity in the eyes of the audience.  It is a wise movie to accomplish this.The climactic scene occurs around the Castorini breakfast table when Johnny finally returns from the Italian mother's deathbed.  (One of the funny running jokes is that the dying mother "recovers" when Johnny arrives, but enters death throes every time Johnny makes plans to return to New York.)  The emotional investment you've made in all the characters pays rich dividends in this final scene.  You get to laugh, and be thrilled, and although the plot seems as realistic as a Puccini libretto, it feels like a slice of life in little Italy.

$REVIEW.: ....terrifically underrated latin actor Johnny Legs shows his acting chops in this Drug Dealer drama. Rappers Fat Joe and Treach add to the street flavor. Classic beauties Isabella Rossellini and Sonia Braga add to the exotica. The plot however really thins out when you realize Legs' character has given this hot shot investor over 3 million in cash in a suitcase...now, what would you do with alla that dough? That's right. The boy and his girl (the ueber babe/semi-actress Denise Sheen...uh...Richards) skips off to South Beach. Not too far from the Versace Mansion. From there it gets messier. What else is wrong with the film? 'Empire', the title. It leads one to believe the protagonist is gonna be so high up the ladder that he's a mover and shaker.....not a street thug. In fact,  the only regal person worth of the title was the Rossellini character. Other than that, it's an alright show.

$review_text.: In a word,........dreadful!  Nicolas Cage should be embarrassed.  Obviously neither he nor his agent read the script prior to signing on.This farce revolved around the theory believed by Cage, apparently a treasure seeker, and his family, that a treasure map existed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.  This map would lead to the location of the National Treasure, an extensive hoard accumulated by the Knights Templar and Freemasons, and hidden from the British back in colonial times.Cage in an expedition in the Arctic uncovers a ship buried beneath the ice which holds a key to the mystery.  The probe is financed by Sean Bean, who turns bad guy and tries to kill Cage and his exceedingly annoying sidekick, Justin Bartha.  And so a race commences between Cage and Bean to steal the Declaration of Independence and ultimately uncover the treasure.Along the way, Cage recruits soon to be love interest, Diane Kruger, a head honcho working in the Archives.This flick seemed to attempt to copy a format popularized by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom; swashbuckling hero, bimbo sidekick and blonde hanger on and love interest.  Unfortunately it was geared for a four year old.  The film was so corny that I rolled my eyes about ten time and glanced at the illuminated face of my watch a half a dozen times.

$REVIEW.: When i first heard they were making a new Batman movie, i thought, it won't be better than the old ones. That was before i went and watched the old ones again, as I hadn't seen them in years.  The first one in 89 was good, but after that, they all completely blowed.  I mean, they just sucked.  The acting was horrible, it was so stupid, it seemed like a comedy.Then I saw the trailer for Batman Begins, and it was amazing.  I have seen the movie 3 times so far, not to mention once in IMAX, and am going to see it again.  It was just awesome.  At first, i didn't like the different look of batman or the batmobile, but you grow to like it, and now i absolutely love it.  The acting was great, and Liam Neeson was a great actor for Ra's.  I liked the new,tougher, almost criminal, Bale as Batman.  He was a great actor as well.As the other review mentioned, the music for a movie can destroy it, or make it incredible.  The old batman movies had freakin circus music and Prince, what the heck.  Hans Zimmer is amazing with this movie.  Already creating incredible soundtracks for Gladiator and King Arthur, for example, he was perfect for Batman.  The music makes the exciting action scenes 20 times better.  I honestly got chills when i watched this movie, it was so good.  For example, the final scene of the train, the music made the scene so much more action packed.  And the "scary" parts, or more disturbing parts with the toxin being inhaled by batman and other people, made THOSE scenes perfect as well.The new batmobile is simply amazing.  When i first saw it, before i saw the movie, i was like "o no, not a dang tank!"  But i later loved it, more than the old crappy ones with the flimsy "wings" on it.  It is just more tough and has better gadgets, like the spike strips, or more spike balls, for that matter.Batman's outfit is much better in these movies.  It doesn't look like crappy rubber or stuff like that, cuz its not.  And the guy who said earlier that he can barely move his head, well, he moves it plenty.  Compared to the old movies, he looks like he isn't even wearing the cowl. In the old ones, there wasn't any head movement at all, he had to move his whole body.  Then there is his cape.  This is the best cape ever made. Batman doesn't have to hold sticks out to make it look like his cape is up.  He can actually glide on it.  Its just so much better.Anyways, that finishes my review. This movie was the best movie i've seen in a long time.  It makes me happy to know that it wasn't really associated with the old ones, and it isn't part of that franchise.  I wouldn't want to be known for those pitiful attempts.  I can't wait till the deluxe edition comes out.  I also can't wait till the next movie comes out, with the Joker and all.
$SUMMARY.: Easily, without a doubt, THE best Batman Movie ever.

$REVIEW.: This is a well-made film on every level.  It's great how they tie in the goings-on of 1969 to work with the story.  And it does work incredibly well.  One thing I liked about it is that the performances are realistic  and it doesn't smack of Hollywood.  It left me with more of a tragic feeling than a romantic one.  You can only shake your head over the complexity of the human heart and society that it exists within.  They should have included Crosby, Stills and Nash's "Find the Cost of Freedom" in there just for good measure, as this movie certainly explores that.  OK, that song is not really about love affairs and their effect on families but about war..  Still, the effect of the affair on her family (the cost of freedom?) is obviously one of the themes in this movie and is in fact part of the price she (and her family) pays.  For better or for worse.I wanted to see this after catching Diane Lane in "Unfaithful", which was a rollarcoaster ride.  "A Walk On The Moon" better fits the drama catagory, and doesn't have the edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting impact of "Unfaithful" though it does gently but surely pull you into its world.  Thus we care about the characters and become quite interested in the story.And yes, it was great to see the legend of Woodstock and the late 60s play into the personal life of one family.  Neither over nor under-done, the final effect is a beleivable and involving movie that didn't exactly have me yearning for those times, but certainly gives a sense of appreciation and understanding for where people were.  While styles and current events have changed, issues of the heart perhaps haven't changed all that much.  The hippie revolution seemed to test those issues (among others), adding another interesting element as backdrop to this ancient dilemma.

$review_text.: I have not seen the original version of this and so will not be writing a comparison.On its own, this is a pretty decent thriller, with Denzel as a man who is dealing with his own scandal and struggle as well as having to take on John Travolta as the angry, bitter man who wants revenge on the city of NY for past injuries.  Tension and some bloodshed occur after JT and his cronies hijack a train underground and hold passengers hostage.Decent entertainment, though not all that memorable.

$REVIEW.: That happens to be a line from the film, &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;.  Tasteless, huh?  Yeah, well, so is the film.  But it also happens to be one of the funniest films of the '70s.  And also one of the most forgotten.The film itself is a collection of skits similiar to those of early  &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Not Necessarily The News&quot; .  But, thankfully, there are no pesky TV censors to hold back any of the  vulgarity.  Some of the stars that are included in these unbelievably nasty  sketches are Donald Sutherland (JFK, Invasion of the Body Snatchers), Bill  Bixby (&quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;) and Tony Dow (The Beav!).  Also,  the film has many very funny moments.  Some of my favorites: &quot;Fistful  of Yen&quot;, which is a cross between old Bruce Lee movies and &quot;The  Wizard Of Oz&quot; and &quot;High Adventure&quot; with explorer Claude  Lamont!The film was directed by John Landis, who went on to direct  &quot;Trading Places&quot;, &quot;Coming To America&quot; and &quot;Spies  Like Us.&quot;  The film also includes David and Jerry Zucker and Jim  Abrahams (&quot;ZAZ&quot;).  They went on to do such classic spoof  comedies, such as &quot;Airplane!&quot;, &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;, and  &quot;Hot Shots!&quot;If you are a fan of any of these other titles  I've mentioned in this review and are not easily offended, then  &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; is for you!Film At Eleven.

$REVIEW.: A well loved classic that I re-visited for the third time. I did have an extra smile this time since I recall Scott Hamilton ice skating to the theme song in what was a very amusing skit on ice. The story is entertaining and the music fits well with the flavor of a tense moment in the sixties. When a country boy meets a group of homeless, city dwelling Hippies he's led on a strange journey he never expected, but will be touched by forever. A bizarre musical that is easily understood by any generation.Chrissy K. McVay - Author

$REVIEW.: Looking back on this movie now, after having watched a plethora of super hero movies, I can honestly say this is a decent movie, but not a GREAT one.This movie was actually one of my first introductions to the world of super heroes (I'd only previously seen the first two Spider-Man movies before watching this and hadn't ever picked up a comic book) so I look back on it with a sense of nostalgia if nothing else. The plot is essentially the essence of the X-Men comics: people who were born different vying for acceptance in a world that fears and hates them, while attempting to stop the "villain" from carrying out his evil plot. (I say "villain" because I'm not really sure if Magneto counts as a villain, if you get right down to it. He and Professor Xavier are basically two sides of the same coin. But, I digress.) It has generally good acting, with one or two exceptionally excellent or horrid performances, and the script...well, it works, usually. What this movie is, more than anything, is a setup for X2, which is by far the best of the series and (in my opinion) one of the better super hero movies in existence. But this first X-Men movie is a solid effort, and a fun watch, if only because Ian McKellen or Patrick Stewart are in it (for the movie buffs) or because there are explosions (for the action fan). And even I, who is generally underwhelmed by the character of Wolverine, have to admit that Hugh Jackman played him perfectly. The only other part I've seen so well-cast is Aragorn of The Lord of the Rings.

Not only are the characters well written and wonderfully acted, but all the details are right as well.

$REVIEW.: Elizabeth Taylor just couldn't seem to get a break in the first five years of the Seventies. She was still the biggest movie star in the world as far as the paparazzi were concerned (as J. G,. Ballard established in his novel CRASH), but her movies didn't do very well and for the most part weren't very good either. This 1973 thriller was one of her better films of the period, less because of her own performance and more because of the intelligent screenplay and the superb color photography (brilliantly transferred to this crystal-clear DVD print). Taylor plays Ellen Wheeler, a wealthy London housewife convinced she's seen a corpse in the window of the creepy abandoned house next door; her husband John (Laurence Harvey) and her best friend Sarah (the famous Beckett actress Billie Whitelaw) are worried for her sanity. Tony Williamson's screenplay (based on an oft-performed stage chiller by Lucille Fletcher, the clever writer of SORRY, YOUNG NUMBER fame) is pretty good at outfoxing the audience at the very end: you've got to see it through because it doesn't end as obviously as you might expect. And the haunted house next door is really a marvel--decrepit, mysteriously shadowed, filled with dripping water sounds inside, and authentically scary.Harvey and Whitelaw are terrific here--intensely focused and yet also teasingly ambiguous--, but even though Taylor gives one of the shrill gaspy histrionic performances that can make you forget the fine work she did in just a few of her films (like A PLACE IN THE SUN and WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF) she's still hard to take your eyes off when she's on screen. Part of the reason is because she's always so spectacularly gussied up, to the point where she wears her full makeup and rubies and diamonds even to bed. The producers gave her couturier Valentino extreme open rein here, and though almost none of her outfits ever seems appropriate to her scenes they're still pretty jawdropping. Valentino's emphasis was clearly on colors that either complemented her violet eyes (such as her enormous lavender caftan or her raspberry traveling suit) or that contrasted with them (like her kicky apricot peignoir). You'll certainly get an eyeful at the very least.

$review_text.: This is a stunning portrait of how one Polish Jew survived the Nazi Holocaust.  This is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), a concert pianist living in Warsaw.  This movie was directed by Roman Polanski (Chinatown).The film opens in Warsaw before any Jews had been put into the ghettos.  Szpilman was playing the piano for Warsaw radio.  A bomb is heard in the distance.  He keeps playing.  Another bomb hits, but closer.  He is still playing.  When a bomb finally blows in the windows and knocks Szpilman across the room, he is forced to acknowledge what is going on.  He is cut, but unhurt.  He returns home to learn that the Nazis require that all Jews in Warsaw must relocate to a ghetto.  After some arguing, the family relocates to the Warsaw Ghetto.This is a movie about the survival of one man during one of the most important and terrible times of the twentieth century.  The film never loses the focus of keeping the camera on Szpilman.  There is so much more going on than what we see on screen, but in the context of the film, those other things are not important.  This is a singular story and it is beautiful and haunting.  There are moments of absolute beauty and wonder, and there are moments that are excruciating to watch.  We know this is a true story, based on a memoir by Szpilman, but we don't know the details of his experience.  The Pianist is a masterpiece by Roman Polanski and it rightfully deserved all of the accolades that it received.

History has shown that in order to destroy a person or group of people you have to demonize them as evil or monsters who is out to destroy you. You and I know that many of the 5 star reviews are republicans/tea party people who have deep hate for our president.I am not surprise that the author and supporters of this movie also go after president Obama family members to prove their point as well.It's also shocking to see that you can write a book or make a movie filled with someone's ideas, lies, lack of evidences to support evil statements, misleading statements,  against someone; people who are smart, educated, supposed to be wise will still believe it. Shocking!!It would be foolish to believe this movies like this one or books  and still vote for republicans /tea parties that cause this country to claps leaving president Obama to clean up the mess they made again. this movie left this fact out.

$review_text.: While this film looks really nice and the camerawork is relatively impressive, it is finally a failure in filmmaking

By no fault of either the Hughes Brothers or Johnny Depp - the only mystery here is how such a talented group of people made a film like this

It isn't enough that the Jack the Ripper story has already been done in so many ways that it has ceased to be interesting, but here the identity of the ripper is telegraphed to the audience at such an early point in the film that it is laughable - like a Scooby Doo cartoon almost

Additionally, it's difficult to suspend disbelief at times - espescially when confronted with Heather Graham's rosy cheeked and milky complected prostitute - who shows her connection to the grotty and filthy streets she inhabits by her perfect straight white teeth and a smudge of dirt on her face

Ultimately a failure, but perhaps worth a rental.

I've been a Naval Aviation follower for many years now and little things about this movie that most people won't notice bother me. Like the aircraft carrier where they begin the mission. The island portion is a box with no number. This is NOT real. This scene is a victim of cheap and bad graphics. The pilot's helmets are totally NOT real either, and look like tank operators helmets. No pilot would ever wear such a helmet. Also the film just doesn't "flow". The story should be told but this film takes too many liberties. Watch the documentary instead IF you want the real story. This film is too "cardboard" California.

The sound is top notch, the production is top notch and the selection of tunes is really strong.  IMO, what makes the dvd is that the crowd is so into the band that you get the feeling that Megadeth had to be in top form, not only because of the shoot, but because the crowd was so over the top.  Two thumbs up.  Metallica has nothing on Megadeth - nothing.

$review_text.: I read years ago that "The Gauntlet" was originally intended to feature the star matchup of Clint Eastwood and Barbra Streisand, but after Eastwood was warned by the Warner Bros. brass of La Streisand's diva tantrums on the set of "A Star is Born" he nixed the idea and cast his "Josey Wales" costar Sondra Locke instead.  Admittedly, a Eastwood-Streisand matchup would have made this film a major blockbuster instead of the solid hit it was, but I'm glad it never happened.  The pair would probably have had no chemistry whatsoever and Streisand would have been unbearably shrill in the role of "two bit hooker" Gus Malley.  Besides, Locke is excellent in the role and proves a terrific sparring partner for Eastwood.  Yes, her subsequent pairings with the legend were less than satisfactory, but for one bright shining moment, Locke's talent would shine brightly."The Gauntlet" actually works strictly because of the Eastwood/Locke chemistry and not because of the unbelievable plot.  Eastwood plays Ben Shockley, a self-described "dumbass cop" and alcoholic who is sent by Phoenix's shady new police commissioner Blakelock (William Prince) to Las Vegas to extradite Malley, who is the only witness to a mob trial.  It becomes obvious from the start that Shockley has been set up and by whom, and the two don't even make it to the airport before they are being chased across the desert by mob assassins.  You'll figure out who's behind everything long before Shockley, but for once, his ineptitude makes sense, since he was sent to do the job because of it.  The plot turns when Shockley figures it out and decides to prove the brass wrong by delivering Malley to the steps of Phoenix city hall, providing he can get through the impenetrable barrier (or "gauntlet") of policemen sent to stop him.Like I said, the plot is unbelievable.  Shockley and Malley dodge so many bullets and escape so many sure death circumstances a total suspension of belief is required to fully enjoy the nonsense.  And the final five minutes is stupid beyond belief, since we are asked to believe the entire Phoenix police force would stand by and watch three people being shot  and do absolutely nothing.  However, the film is fast-paced and the action scenes are expertly mounted and the film never drags for a single moment in 109 minutes.  Eastwood directs with economy and style and with tongue firmly placed in cheek, and for once, the lightning pacing many have yearned for in his recent, more leisurely paced films.  And the performances are universally excellent, especially by Locke, Pat Hingle as Shockley's concerned partner-turned-patsy, Michael Cavanaugh as a seemingly sympathetic assistant district attorney, and '70's Eastwood regular Bill McKinney, who is absolutely hilarious as a smarmy constable taken hostage by the desperate pair.  In fact, anyone who thinks Locke can't act should watch the expert interplay between her and McKinney when he decides to have fun insulting her and she turns the tables on him, twisting the screws until he explodes.  This scene alone is worth the price of of the DVD, and it should serve as a rebuttal to Locke detractors everywhere.  I also liked the subtle way Eastwood and Locke's relationship turns from adversarial to actual love and affection.  Nowhere in the script is there a specific moment where they fall in love, they just do, and they make the transition believable strictly through their interplay.The film makes great use of Nevada/Arizona locations and has a terrific jazz score by Jerry Fielding, who heavily borrows from gospel standards like "A Closer Walk (my Lord to Thee)."  In fact, the film is littered with religious symbolism, but why is a mystery.  In all, the entire production is a solid, professional piece of work by the entire Eastwood team at Malpaso.  And while it will never be considered in the same class as such top-drawer Eastwood directorial efforts as "Outlaw Josey Wales," "Unforgiven," and "Mystic River," it remains to this day a solid entertainment that seems to improve with each viewing, just as long as you shut your brain off completely at the end.As for the DVD, WHV has done better.  However, at least it's in panavision widescreen instead of the pan-and-scan that the VHS copies contain.  And could we have a little more than the standard theatrical trailers for extras?  All in all, it rates ***1/2 (out of *****)for the film and **1/2 for the DVD presentation.

There are alot of other Marvel heroes that make guest appearances such as Hulk, Iron Man, Ant Man, She-Hulk, but the best is Namor the Sub-Mariner.  "Imperius Rex" and "Atlantis Attacks" were two of my favorite episodes and both have the Sub-Mariner.  The epidsode "Hard Knocks" featured a knock down drag out with the Hulk which is my sons favorite episode.The voice actors and the way they animated the four really do capture the essence of the characters as was intended by Smilin' Stan and the King.  I especially love the way Johnny (Human Torch) is portrayed especially when he screams like a little girl, hilarious!The story appears to be a continuation from the Fox motion picture because Doom is with the four during their foray into cosmic rays.  This is all presented during the opening credits which by the way features a catchy little techno riff that really grows on you.  So pick this up and you wont be disapointed I promise.EXCELSIOR!!!!

$REVIEW.: First, let me start off wih saying that you have to be a real hardcore Halloween fan, like I am, to love it. If you're interested in following up on this movie, than watch Halloween 1,2, and H20. Don't bother with the rest. They have nothing to do with it. If you watch those three, that will give you a basic backround of the series. Now, onto the review... (SPOILERS)The first 10-15 min. of this film are the best. It features Jamie Lee, but ends with her death. It slowly gets exciting from there until you get to the last 30 min with Sara (Bianca Kasjlich) trying to get away from Michael by using her Palm Pilot to communicate to her friend who is watching the webcast. He types and sends messages on his palm pilot of where Michael is and which way she should go. It's just plain exciting.The deaths are definitly above average. There are SO much better than the deaths in H20. See below for a list of deaths.Overall, this was an above average entry into the series. Go and see it even if you're not a fan, you'll enjoy the deaths.LIST OF DEATHS (SPOILERS)Decapitation (Off-Screen)Slit ThroatStabbed/Fall Off Roof (Jamie Lee)Tripod Through NeckStabbed In HeadImpaled On SpikeSkull CrushedDecapitationStabbed To DoorHung And Stabbed With Trowel (Off-Screen)Burned (Michael - Not Dead)

$REVIEW.: `Bus Stop' is one of those films that is largely considered the highlight of Marilyn Monroe's career.  She personally viewed this performance as her best and thought that it legitimized her as a serious actress.  While she was denied an Oscar nomination for her work (sadly, she never received one) maybe people feel that it was a serious snub looking back.  With that thought in mind, I decided to indulge last night and what I found was something far different than I expected.I hated this movie.My hatred for this film really doesn't have much to do with Miss Monroe, outside of her sliding accent, but her presence cannot overshadow the film's most eye-rolling of flaws.  Between the script and the ludicrous performance by Don Murray, this film sinks to a serious new low.The film tells the story of a brash young cowboy who ventures into Phoenix to compete in the rodeo and find himself a woman.  He catches a glimpse of Cherie, a young caf&eacute; singer with bigger dreams, and decides that she is going to be his bride.  He then bombards her with his company and forces her into his marriage plans even though she constantly puts up protest.  He then becomes a bully, yelling and screaming and accusing her of trying to trick him and he kidnaps her in an attempt to get her to his farm.  All the while, his older cowboy friend tells him he's wrong but really does nothing about it.  In fact, no one does anything about it while he's chasing her through the nightclub she works at or physically assaulting her at a bus stop, IN FRONT OF MANY PEOPLE.  It's such a bizarre film and the sad thing is that it is supposed to be taken seriously.  This isn't a comedy and none of this is played for laughs.It's just stupid.Murray gives a one-note disaster of a performance, hooting and hollering and acting like a buffoon throughout the entirety of the film until he has a sudden about face and actually delivers a sincere conclusion.  Until that moment, his performance can be described in one word; gross.  How he received an Oscar nomination for this is beyond me.  Monroe is decent here.  She gets the emotional depth of the character, but her accent work is semi-atrocious, and it certainly gets worse and worse as the film moves along.  I much preferred her in `The Misfits' and `Some Like it Hot' where she matched her emotional developments with an effortlessness that she loses here while she struggles to make her accept stick.  Arthur O'Connell is fine, but he's completely overshadowed by his abrasive screen-partner.Overall, this is a mess.  It doesn't say much of anything and it doesn't offer much of anything either, outside of a sultry introduction shot of Monroe in a windowsill.

$review_text.: In the mid-90's many of Marvel's characters came to the small screen on Saturday mornings after the success of X-men and Spiderman


 One of those was Marvel's very first group of Superheroes, the Fantastic Four


 With the movie due to come out in a few weeks, it's great to have these episodes on DVD finally

 The set contains all 26 episodes of the run
 While I agree that the first season (And I have them on VHS because I am a geek) was inferior to the second season, the first season is not without its merits, mainly in the presentation of the group's origin as well as the two part "Silver Surfer and the Coming of Galactus" episode
 This is one of the key moments in Marvel's silver age history and I thought they did a very nice job with it
 I also enjoyed the Behold the Negative Zone episode as I loved the goofy villains Annihilus and Blaastar.Things do pick up in season two in 1995 with several outstanding episodes including:The Three part Inhumans Saga where the FF battle the Frightful Four and then eventually travel to the hidden Great Refuge of the Inhumans.To Battle the Living Planet - The FF enlist the Aid of Galactus to battle Ego, the Living Planet, but at what price?  Thor co-stars.When Calls Galactus - Galactus is back to devour the earth and only the sacrifice of Frankie Raye saves the earth as she becomes his new herald named Nova.Nightmare in Green - The Thing battles the Hulk!  Nuff said!Doomsday is an adaption of one of my favorite stories as Dr

Doom captures the Silver Surfer and steals his power to battle the FF.While the animation on the Fantastic Four wasn't quite as good as Spiderman or the X-men, it was still pretty good and the show really seemed to be hitting its stride when it ended after just two seasons
 And of course this is vastly superior to the two earlier cartoon versions of the 60's and 70's

 Herbie the robot anyone?

$review_text.: "No questions, that's all I ask." When members of the Most Wanted terrorist list in Europe begin to get killed off the US Ambassador (Sutherland) sends for the best of the best. A former FBI field agent (Slater) begins to investigate. Judging by the plot and the cast this is one I was all ready to watch and enjoy. I had high expectations and was excited to see this. Then the movie started. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. The acting was OK, but the movie was just so incredibly slow moving that I really found it had to pay attention to. This really felt like a made for TV movie with better actors. There have been a lot of anti-terrorist movies lately and none of them seem to really be that interesting. This one had the possibility of being one of the best. Then I watched it. While not as bad as the Steven Segal or Dolph Lundgren movies that have been coming out it's still not anything to rush out and see. Overall, long and boring and hard to stay focused on. I give it a C-.
$Helpful?.: [6, 8] $review_summary.: A really long and boring movie with a great cast. I had high hopes and was disappointed. Nothing to rush to. I say C-

$REVIEW.: Imelda Staunton leads the tremendous cast of Mike Leigh's latest window into old Britain with wonderful subtlety
Her Vera Drake is instantly endearing: she nags without being a nag, cares for those around her without being a bother, bosses without being bossy, and gives the local troubled girls abortions while humming a tune


Unfortunately for Staunton and cast, Leigh splits the film into two distinct parts: before and after Vera gets busted


Before is wonderful
The people are brimming with life and stunningly realized


After is a long bore of streaming tears and garbled utterances
The plot never leads the way, and shouldn't in this kind of film, but the second half tries to rely on plot in such a way as to render it pointless
Viewers know what will happen, there are no surprises, and the performances stagnate
Additionally, a sidebar tale of a well-to-do girl that requires an abortion and has virtually no trouble getting one simply needed to be cut, as it serves no purpose but to show how differently the lives of the rich are when compared to the lives of the poor


But we knew that already

We don't need a little mini-tale to show us, and especially when it concerns this topic

Despite all its flaws, Vera Drake is worth seeing, as the dreary tear-soaked ending may not bother everyone


Had Leigh continued in the vein in which he began the film, it would have been a real marvel.

the film is good and worth the money, but Best musical ever? I don't knowBut to each his own I have a different story to tell
 Michael Jackson was a big Fred Astaire Fan he says so in an interview about his Grammy Awards performance of Billie Jean, Fred Astaire called Michael after the performance and Michael was very complimented by the call...

The way Michael tips the hat forward from the back  Ive seen Astaire do the same moveAnyway I read about the Video Smooth Criminal

and it was inspired by the last dance number of The Band wagon.....
one reviewer refers to the dance number as Mickey Spillane esqSo if you interested In my story I suggest if you have never seen the Michael Jackson video Smooth Criminal  See it on U Tube then see this movie....

Ive always been interested where Inspiration comes from.Anyway I hope you enjoyed this different look at the movie

They have successfully raised a film from the dead A long, long, time ago a list was published called &quot;The Lost Sound Serials&quot; GHSA was one of them

There was  no hope to ever see this story again, until Anchor Bay makes a fine print  brought fromk Universals original film negatives


 As for the movie, it's  good but not great

Warren Hull brings more dignity to the role of GH

Keye  Luke is a passable Kato, but expect no  Bruce Lee, Kato rarley gets into a  fight

The story is full of action, adventure and heart stopping  cliffhangers


 It's great fun for children and adults.

$REVIEW.: the camera work is phenomenal and is generally edited very well -- in the behind the scenes extra you see how much inactivity the crew had to sit through to get the final footage.David Attenborough is his usual self, soft spoken and easy to understand while being informative.the series as noted deals with different segments of the ocean from the beginning Ocean World (a general overview) to the Coasts (as he saids, the most dynamic) and i suspect if you have even a remote interest in marine life there is something in this series for you.my favorite is disk two with Open Ocean and The Deep; not coincidently, i find these two to be have the best cinematography. the images of marlins and tunas exploding through a huge tightly packed school is remarkable until hear Attenborough announces 'they have attracted a giant' and a whale materializes out of the blue depths.this entire series is shot in enhanced resolution so most of the footage is very sharp -- but none more so than in The Deep (with the black background and the lack of suspended particles); it seems unreal in clarity. deep water footage is harder to get due to the specialized equiptment necessary to withstand the immense pressure so i shouldn't have been surprised to see something completely new... Attenborough takes you to what looks to be underwater lake -- it's water of the highest salinity and is denser than surrounding waters so it kind of collects like a lake -- this is described in greater detail in one of the behind the scenes features. just astonishing.i've watched this series several times and really enjoyed each time; with the exception of Ken Burn's Civil War, i have never been so impressed a documentary series.

$REVIEW.: SEXY BEAST is the best British gangster flick right now.  It joins the ranks of UK mob classics like 1971's GET CARTER w/ a mean Michael Caine and 1981's THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY w/ a meaner Bob Hoskins.  2001's SEXY BEAST has Ben Kingsley playing the meanest, baddest, most despicable ... mobster of them all, Don Logan.  Don heads to Spain to drag his old partner outta retirement to do 1 last heist back in London.  The great Ray Winstone memorably plays &quot;Gal&quot; Dove, the unlucky bloke trying to enjoy life in his Spain mansion.Man!  Kingsley gave me the creeps the moment the back of his bulging bald head 1st appears.  He is even scarier than Joe Pesci in GOODFELLAS.  The looks of Kingsley's Logan with bald head &amp; veins popping and goatee could make him pass for an older but supermenacing Stone Cold Steve Austin of the WWF!  Even the sight of Logan urinating on the rug (in Gal's villa!) gave me goosebumps.  He would kill Tony Soprano with his bloody stare!SEXY BEAST is MY Sopranos!  This is MY SCARFACE!  Give Ben who once played Gandhi an Oscar nomination.  Just give him the ... Oscar!  And Ray Winstone is sooooooooo terrific here.  He is on a roll after his other flicks NIL BY MOUTH &amp; THE WAR ZONE.  It was also great to see another fine Brit actor Ian McShane (remember LOVEJOY on cable's A&amp;E?) as a gay mobster w/ 1 sinister sm:)e.  I adore his all black business suits and sleek trenchcoat.SEXY BEAST is a job well done by music video director Jonathan Glazer who shows us 1 of the most bizarre (underwater) bank robberies I've ever seen.  I won't give much but don't you think Winstone and the robbers should've drained the Turkish bath pool that's next to the bank first?  I am still putting this classic in my Top 3 Best Films of 2001 and it is only June.  Hope it will be honored @ Oscar time in 2002.

$REVIEW.: Don't get me wrong -- Signing Time is wonderful!!  All of the Signing Time videos we've purchased have been excellent.  One extra nice thing about this one is that the music is low-key, so that it doesn't keep you awake at night when a song is stuck in your head!  Rachel makes learning ASL so easy -- she explains the signs so well that they are easy to remember.  And watching her sing/speak and sign is fun and interesting, as you can try to pick up signs while watching.  My only criticism of this video (hence the 4 stars) is that she does some talking at the end without signing -- a disappointment!And, I would love it if Signing Time would put out a video that teaches ASL "grammar," if there is such a thing (how do you actually converse in ASL??) -- Or maybe provide it in the form of an instructional add-on.

$review_text.: Ok forget the notion of this being a cheap Goodfellas knock-off and acknowledge it as something way more different than Goodfellas. Goodfellas is too talky and it drags in some parts where as this movie has way more action and not one part that bores you. Barry Pepper did a great job as Matty Demerest, the son of legendary mob boss Benny Chains, who is played brilliantly by the very versatile Dennis Hopper. Matty is in a business filled with stone-cold killers and thieves but he is more of a good guy mobster and aspires for a brighter and better future. As far as Dennis Hopper, his performance in this movie has elevated him to the level of Pacino and De Niro. John Malkovic shows off his versatility as Uncle Teddy and further adds on another top-notch performance to his legacy. Seth Green as Johnny Marbles is the least responsible of the four guys trying to retrieve a missing bag filled with two million dollars and does more than enough to anger the other guys. Andrew Divoli did a great job as Scarpa, a man trying to go straight but the temptation of being a big time mobster is what makes him stay in the business. And Vin Diesel as Taylor turns in another top-notch performance. It shows how great Vin Diesel really is as an actor. He's also some-what of a good guy saving Matty's life twice despite being in the same business as Chains and Teddy and the part when he beats up that guy in the bar shows that you can't mess with The Diesel. Ok so there might not be as much action as you expect but it's spur of the moment action and the movie flows well. This is a movie for all Vin Diesel fans!

$REVIEW.: "Mae West - The Glamour Collection" is a good  addition to the film library of fans of the legendary blonde and for the general Hollywood collector.The set includes 5 movies ranging from mediocre to great, "Night After Night" (1932)- in my opinion is the worst film of the bunch, "I'm No Angel" (1933) - is the funniest, "Goin' to Town" (1935) - is the most enjoyable, ""Go West, Young Man" (1936) - is mediocre West and "My Little Chickadee" (1940) - pairs West with the legendary W.C Fields."Night After Night" ** , is a curiosity item because it is Mae West's screen debut

The film stars George Raft, who plays Joe, a former boxer and owner of a speakeasy who is interested in romancing an attractive and mysterious socialite, Miss Jerry Healy (Constance Cummings)

Whatever one thinks of the film (I am not too enamoured with it as I find it a bit tedious to get through) there is no denying once West's Maudie Triplett enters the scene, she steals the show and despite her brief appearance here, delivers some of her classic dialogues  ("Goodness had nothing to do with it, dearie.") The scene in the hotel bedroom with West and Alison Skipworth dealing with a hangover and an innocent misunderstanding is a hoot


This film may have been a star vehicle for the other actors but Mae West managed to steal the spotlight off them and several decades later, this film is remembered mostly for her presence."I'm No Angel" ****

This film is one of West's best features and it contains some of her wittiest dialogue


West plays Tira, a circus performer who hits the big time as a lion tamer
Her fame and prestige catches the eye of several male suitors, one of them is the dashing Jack Clayton (Cary Grant) who is clearly smitten and proposes marriage


Wanting to settle down with Clayton, Tira decides she wants to quit her circus act but her manager concocts a scheme in order to keep her in the show and destroy her relationship


Much has been said about this charming early 30's comedy
As mentioned, it contains some of West's wittiest dialogue and she delivers them fast and furious and some of her most famous lines are featured here including "When I'm good I'm very good but when I'm bad, I'm better" and "It's not the men in your life that count, it's the life in your men"


And when asked by her shady Manager (after Tira got herself in a bit of trouble) "How are you mixed up in all of this?" Her response: "Like an olive in a dry martini." The woman was a hoot however West's ego stroking is at it's zenith in this film which is also my main complaint

Despite the bawdy humour and hysterical dialogue, there is too much of Mae and far too much swooning over her and her physical appeal

A bit less would have worked better especially considering that Hollywood's other more conventional bombshells, Harlow, Monroe, Welch, Hayworth etc, hardly had this many men salivating over them in one 90 minute feature
We get it, Tira, as written, is a bewitching temptress, but the audience doesn't need reminding every 5 minutes on how irresistible she is since it becomes tiresome and at times, laughable and the standard then becomes too impossibly high to meet with only a few women being able to meet or exceed that incredibly high expectation

Still, this is a funny movie and is definitely one of her best."Goin' to Town" ****
This film is probably my favorite in this set as it contains her witty dialogue and trademark "purrrr's" and most importantly, is very entertaining

West plays Cleo Borden
A temptress with a past who marries into the big leagues but despite having all the money in the world, she is shunned by most of high society and has a difficult time trying to swoon the man of her affections

There is a lot that happens in this film which is one of the reasons it's never boring


West flirts, becomes engaged, becomes a widow, travels to Argentina, flirts some more, marries, and is constantly feuding with the many men, including Edward Carrington (Paul Cavanagh), the man of her desire and an incredibly snobby and ruthless high society lady, Mrs


Crane Brittony played tremendously by Marjorie Gateson


Although this film was released when the strict production code was in effect, West delivers some funny dialgue including one of my favorites:Cleo: "Yeah, for a long time I was ashamed of the way I lived."Man: "You mean to tell me, you've reformed?"Cleo: "No, I got over being ashamed."Or the scene as she is trying to tell her not so intelligent male suitor that they are not right for each other:Cleo: Listen Ivan, you're alright to play around with but as a husband, you get in my hair....
Besides, we're  intellectual opposites".Ivan: "What do you mean?"Cleo: "Well I'm intellectual and you're opposite.""Goin' to Town" is classic Mae West


It is not often recognized as being her best film but for my money, it is one of her best and it stands up to repeated viewings."Go West Young Man" **  is a tame West vehicle

By this time, the censors were successful in watering down her material so do not expect a lot of her witty and sexually laced dialogue
There is very little of it here


West plays Mavis Arden, a temperamental movie star who is constantly being scrutinized by her press agent, Morgan (Warren Williams)

Morgan is secretly in love with her and tries to sabotage all of her dates and personal appearances with the male population
During one of these personal appearance tours, her car breaks down and she is forced to take refuge in a boarding house populated by several colorful characters, including a star-struck girl (Isabel Jewell) and a strapping mechanic (Randolph Scott) whom Arden becomes smitten with


In comparison to her other star vehicles, this one is rather lackluster and it's not solely due to the watered down treatment of her dialogue

The film is rather weak, and if there is a West feature that has a running time that feels endless, it's this one


There is not much action here and West plays a rather shallow, unlikeable character and despite moments of redemption, you end up caring for no one and even the secondary characters come across as a bit annoying
Good to watch at least once as there is no accounting for personal taste, but for me, this is mediocre West and she has done and will do better."My Little Chickadee" *** 
Considering this was the anticipated pairing of West and Fields, the film is not the stand-out masterpiece one would expect as it still takes a back-seat to her superior "She Done Him Wrong" and the more bawdy "Belle of the Nineties"

However, this film still entertains
West plays Flower Belle Lee, a scorned woman who is run out of her home-town, Little Bend, for being accused of romancing a masked bandit


She is permitted to return once she can prove she is respectable and married


Accompanying her on her travel to Greasewood City is the obnoxious Mrs
Gideon (played annoyingly by Margaret Hamilton) who played a crucial role in her tarnished image

Along the way they meet Cuthbert J
Twillie (W.C Fields)
Although they are a mis-matched pair, they stage a fake marriage and Flower Belle wins back her respectability however trouble seems to follow them to the untamed Greasewood City as the masked bandit is still in hot pursuit of Flower Belle
The movie has it's moment and there are some genuinely funny scenes

One involving a goat and the other, a classroom full of immature boys and the always funny Flower Belle
If you are fans of West, Fields and Hamilton, you will love this pictures


My complaint is that as the film moves along, the novelty wears off and most of the characters become irritating, with the probable exception of West

I happen to think that West actually looked better in her later films ("Everyday's a Holiday", "My Little Chickadee" and "The Heat's On") than in her earlier films and it is more believable, at least for me, to accept her as a temptress desired by all the men that lay eyes upon her


The pairing of these 2 stars is an interesting one and the film has its moments of wit, action and comedy


Legend has it that the 2 stars could not stand each other, if this is true, you cannot tell in the final picture.The films are contained within 2 DVD's

"Night After Night" and "I'm No Angel" is presented on the first side of the first disc with "Goin' to Town" on the reverse side

The other 2 films are presented on the same side of the second disc


The picture quality and sound on all films is simply okay and are no better than the many VHS versions I previously owned


There are no extras other than the trailers for 2 of the films - "I'm No Angel" and "My Little Chickadee"
Each film comes with a chapter selection and language option and there are no linear notes


So basically you just get the film's
For the price, it is worth it


I just wish the set would be more complete as it omits a couple of West's better films such as "She Done Him Wrong" - arguably her best feature, the entertaining "Belle of the Nineties" (1934), the rather interesting drama "Klondike Anne" (1936) and the rather enjoyable "Every Day's a Holiday" (1937) which is Mae West lite and a weaker entry in her film catalogue but still fun to watch
I would have preferred any of these over 2 of the films featured here
Regardless, this is recommended to the fans, if you haven't purchased this set already.Untamed, always fun, funny and bawdy, this legendary, full-figured blonde is fun to watch and is pure, unabashed entertainment


Recommended.

$REVIEW.: So there I was in the theatre, enjoying myself.  This was a fun movie, funny, with some great performances by Robert Downey Jr. and nothing too bad from anyone else, and like Waking Life was very interesting to look at (though somewhat discombobulating during moments when the camera would move and perspective would change).  Then suddenly I realized I had no idea where this was going.  It was the cinematic equivalent of listening to somebody tell a story and then suddenly realizing that you hadn't been paying attention.At first I figured it was me, that I really hadn't been paying attention.  However, thinking back on it, a few things really helped create this sudden dissonance:-The rotoscoping process.  It's pretty, and used to great effect here, but it does create an extra layer between the action and the audience that sometimes makes one want to tear through the screen to see what's really going on behind it.-A sudden and complete change of tone.  This movie went from a stoner comedy to a depressing drama in the blink of an eye, and the blink was covered up by the rotoscoping process so we missed it.-Random changes in exposition.  From different subjective camera shots to a sudden use of voice-over narration to finally just dropping one perspective and changing characters, the movie just suddenly glides off-track like a car on ice.  Or maybe I was wrong to think that Keanu Reeve's character was the character through which we were supposed to understand the plot, and really it was a more "objective" camera we were behind... which makes the druggy subjective animation kind of ill-fitting...Actually, this use of audience dissonance could be a superb use of structure, where something that is fun and funny suddenly becomes deathly serious to the point of schizophrenia... like the drug in the film.  That would be very interesting if that were true.I really liked most of the movie and Robert Downey Jr.'s character was fantastic, but I can't say I really liked the end result.  To me, it fell apart, and for a movie that was amazingly engaging from the beginning, that seems like a hard thing to do.--PolarisDiB

$review_text.: Taking the old zombie/living dead legends and movie treatments, and then standing them on their ears, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is a perversely funny and, yet, fiercely frightening movie. A combination of &quot;The Night of the Living Dead,&quot; &quot;Thriller&quot;, and a little bit of &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;, RETURN OF THE LIVING Dead is a great punk horror film. The tag-lines are hysterical. (My favorite: &quot;Hey, guys, how can you kill something that's already dead?&quot; &quot;You know, Frank, the kid's got a good point there&quot;)Some gruesome special effects, especially the make-up, are effective, but they do not overwhelm the film. The cast, playing it up between tongue-in-cheek camp and true terror, is made up mostly of no ones but they are quite up to the task. RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is a great horror comedy.

There's nothing in/to Boyle, yet, &amp; may never be. Who can say? Diaz IS lovely/charming here, &amp; the attempt is generally sweet, well-meant, but the script is atrocious, sophomoric.

$review_text.: I guess this DVD could be considered a "follow-up" to "Morse" I don't necessarily think that it really is.  Lewis, as "Inspector Morse's" sidekick, to me, has always stood on his own as a detective and this presentation proves that he is one darn good detective,  I hope that this a beginning of a series with more episodes yet to come.I really (and always have) liked Kevin Whatley as Inspector Lewis.  This time he is on his own and is, for once, (instead of John Thaw, as Morse) allowed to be kind of cranky and a little befuddled with the "new" technology in police work.--he even orders an alcoholic drink and gets to tell his sidekick to have orange juice.  In this presentation, he has a great partner in Detective Sergeant James Hathaway, as played very well by Laurence Fox.  They are really a good team with Hathaway guiding Lewis through the maze of the "new" technology in police work.This is really a good mystery--complicated enough to keep one awake and with enough twists and turns to keep one guessing "who done it?"I really enjoyed this presentation--I WANT more Inspector Lewis.

$REVIEW.: Anthony Horowitz has acquired a well-deserved reputation with his incisive and always interesting teleplays in the English mystery genre. His work in POIROT, MIDSOMER MURDERS, and FOYLE'S WAR are well-known to Anglophiles who regularly watch those TV series. With the five-part miniseries  INJUSTICE Horowitz is not confined to continuing characters and constrained  to a pre-established plot-line formula. The story revolves around a barrister defending a colleague from a murder charge,, but Horowitz skillfully interwines fascinating character arcs, courtroom theatrics, police procedural routine while embellishing the tale with his characteristic sense of irony and moral ambiguity. that will please fans of courtroom drama. The always excellent James Purefoy (THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE and ROME) is the barrister and Nathaniel Parker (THE INSPECTOR LYNLY MYSTERIES) is his client. Both deliver compelling performances.

I note one reviewer was disturbed over the dog thing, but obviously didn't worry about Excel or Hyatt dropping dead regularly & the dog actually makes it through all 5 eps on this dvd & even sings the closing song (although seasoned a few times) My daughter was upset I kept stopping the closing to read all the comments (The English voice actress's wardrobe is credited to different sources each ep such as Straight Jackets "R" Us


There's a running joke about Andrew Kent in every closing credit
Ep 2 lists Translator Housing as Arcam Asylum


We even get a knock-knock joke.)I usually watch in English with the subtitles beneath(except Dragonball Z-MUST hear the Japanese Vegeta voice), but sincerely had a hard time keeping up with the English jokes at the same time as the Japanese

I cannot believe how fast the actress speaks the next ep previews so reading the alternate version at the same time is hopelessly incomprehensible--separate is a must
Very much the Airplane/Naked Gun throw-everything-at-the-audience-&-something-will-stick genre
I didn't notice the bathhouse in every opening until watching the clean version--there is really too much to catch the first time
The vocal cast is ADV's group we've heard on Sorcerer Hunters & the Japanese cast includes Kotono Mitsuishi-Sailor Moon as our heroine Excel, Yuko Mizutani-Sorcerer Hunters/Chocolate as the Great Will of the Macrocosm, & Ryuzaburo Ohtomo-DBZ/Dabura & Bastard/Abigail as the Demon Sergeant in Ep 4 & Kabapu in Ep 5.If you love tongue-in-cheek, this is a MUST

$REVIEW.: This is easily the best of all the Star Wars movies.  For once we have the right balance of action, mystery, humor, romance and swash-bucklingness, if that's a word.  The dialogue is crisp and smart (Han steers the ship into an asteroid field.  Leia: You don't have to do this to impress me!)  The acting this time is actually quite good, particularly between Ford and Fisher.  The special effects are incredible, but they serve, rather than overwhelm, the story.  (Oddly, there are a few moments that look fake, such as the bits with the taun-tauns, but George chose not to redo them.)  This one is closest in style and content to the old-fashioned movie and radio serials, which is what the whole thing was supposed to be based on.  The first ten minutes are a little wobbly, as it seems to be trying to find its tone, but things soon pick up, and the evacuation from Hoth has to be one of the best moments in the whole series, climaxing in a Millennium Falcon that won't start.  ("Would it help if I got out and pushed!?")  I know in the past I've said it might have been better if George had just given us one movie and been done with it, and artistically for his career it would have been, but at least, before the franchise got stale, we got this wonderful, smartly-done fairy tale directed by the very underrated Irvin Kershner.Here, as in the other DVDs featuring before and after versions of the original trilogy, George chose to give us terrific-looking enhanced-for-widescreen-TVs redos (among the best-looking DVDs I own, if not THE best) and unenhanced original versions.  Fortunately for me I have an upscaling DVD player and television, so it doesn't look *as* bad for me as it does for a lot of other people here, but still, this is just George being spiteful--there was no reason for this.  The commentary track is terrific, and justifies this purchase alone if you're a big fan.  We hear from most of the major creative forces, including director Kirshner, the only Star Wars director who really "got it" as far as I'm concerned.  (And the one Lucas was most upset with initially, thinking he was taking too long and doing too many takes.  But the quality shows.  Could you imagine the love scenes between Han and Leia directed by Lucas?  Actually you don't have to; just watch Attack of the Clones.)It's hard to "recommend" or "not recommend" something like this.  It has its built-in audience--it's doubtful anyone buying this has never seen the film before.  It is nice to have the two versions side by side to compare what's new, however, which is why I chose to go this route.(P.S.: George, who the heck is "Lando Clarissian"?  Also, Venus isn't a gaseous giant; it's a rocky planet like earth.  You folks will have to listen to the commentary track to understand what I'm talking about.)

$review_text.: The five star rating is for the show and not for the DVDs.It all came together for 'Law & Order: Criminal Intent' in the second season
As a fan of cop shows back to the some of the first on TV, this series ranks in the top 5


Goren is simply incredible and the entire cast was in full stride in Season Two

Great stories, great acting, great television.My gripe with the DVDs is that they began putting a synopsis before each episode along with cast details, etc

You click for the selected episode and you are then presented with all this information before you must click again to actually play the episode
That would be all fine and good - except - the synopsis for several of the episodes are complete spoilers! Just one example would be the season's second episode 'Bright Boy' where they tell you in the synopsis who is responsible for the murders! So, be warned, don't read them if you still want to watch Goren work his magic and still be surprised as it unravels for the perp.The other issue, of course, is that Universal has apparently chosen to drop Law & Order: Criminal Intent from their DVD offerings after three seasons

They are the worst of the worst when it comes to starting a series and then dropping it after a season or two


They've done it to some classic series that deserved much better
Strangely, Universal released Season 3 BEFORE Season 2, so actually this is the last we've heard from Universal on this show

What a pity
'Law & Order: Criminal Intent' deserved the full treatment

Maybe they will reconsider? Many of us are ready and waiting for Season Four!

$SUMMARY.: Second Season a Great Year! Just one gripe with the DVDs.

$REVIEW.: "Bedlam", one of Val Lewton's lesser known efforts with the late and great Boris Karloff, delivers a kind of a Edgar Allan Poe type tale about insanity and sanity, the corruption of the powers that be, etc.  None of this is as attractive as the setting and the costumes, and the style of the movie far exceeds its actual content.  Karloff turns in a fantastic performance as the creepy George Sims, cruel apothecary of Bedlam asylum.  You've gotta love the wig he wears.  It makes him look even more ghoulish than his natural hair.In an attempt to ingratiate himself to the obese, moronic but ultimately good natured Lord Mortimer (Billy House), Sims takes the "idiots" (the inmates of his asylum) to lordly dinner parties and humiliates them for Mortimer's benefit.  There is one unforgettable scene in which he paints an insane young man a shining gold, trying to make him look like a Greek god.  When he dies of suffocation due to the shutting of his pores, the hero of the film, Anna Lee, breaks with Mortimer, a decision which to Sims' amusement lands her in Bedlam.She is a heroic and strong character with a great deal of empathy for the insane people Sims treats as dogs.  Some of the scenes are simply unbelievable, such as when Sims puts her in a cage with an apparently chained, dangerous man in an attempt to disprove her Quaker philosophy of loving all human beings.  With a few words she woos this dangerous man into submission and befriends him.  He eventually helps her escape.The best scene by far is when the inmates "try" Sims, and find him guilty of sanity.  They then wall him up alive, unbeknownst to the authorities who investigate later on.  The paltry plot aside, the flashes of Hogarth's engravings and the dreadful mood of the film make it worth buying.  No one could make anything out of a script this bad but Val Lewton.  As you might imagine, Karloff makes the film.

$review_text.: There have been many entries of J-horror ever since the success of "Ringu" in the U.S., not to mention an overabundance of Asian horror remakes. Before this film does officially get massacred by Hollywood, (it has been marked for remake hell) I thought it may be the best time to review this piece of Japanese horror. J-Horror theater 2: PREMONITION (aka. YOGEN, 2004) is based on the manga by Jiro Tsunoda called "Kyofu Shimbun" (Newspaper of Terror). Directed by Norio Tsurata, the film does have a somewhat nostalgic feel to it, similar to the 60's TV show "Twilight Zone"; which wouldn't be surprising since the Japanese comic became popular in the 1970's.Newspapers are used to tell the past, but for a few unlucky individuals, they foretell the future. When Hideki (Hiroshi Mikami) picked up a piece of a newspaper that foretells his daughter`s death, he is so puzzled as to what this piece of paper meant and before he realizes what is happening, he is too late to save her.After the accident, Hideki and his wife Ayaka (beauteous Noriko Sakai, Ju-On 2), divorced and they go their separate ways. Three years have passed, Ayaka had been researching this strange phenomena with the aid of a medium, Prof. Mikoshiba (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) while Hideki fears that if he picks up a newspaper, he will see death. Nonetheless, Hideki begins foretelling ill-omened fate of murder to train crashes, there is nothing Hideki can do to stop the events...or is there? Now, Hideki and Ayaka must find others who have experienced this mysterious phenomenon, in hope of finding an answer. Little do they know that they will be changing their lives forever....The film does have a good plot and even references the famous psychic Chizuko Mifune, the medium who was discovered by a spiritualistic professor and who later committed suicide. The direction by Norio Tsurata is quite competent but somehow I think his style does push the film a bit to human drama than towards chilling horror. Tsurata does steer the film towards a melodramatic approach and while I appreciate that he took the time to flesh out his characters, some viewers may take it as a way to divert the film from its horrific premise. Still, the film does have a number of intense scenes that are both chilling and unnerving. The film does take its time, which helps its script as it builds credibility through its screenplay.The film's cinematography is polished and stylized. Although some of the CGI effects does look a little cheesy at times. Despite its faults, the ominous music and the nicely paced sequences do assist the film in entertaining me. I am a bit put off by Hiroshi Mikami's performance, he was trying a bit too hard to act terrified. Fortunately, Noriko Sakai is around to bail him out. Sakai is a great actress and quite a treat to look at.Now about the plot. The film focuses more on the phenomena's investigation rather than scenes after scenes of deaths and accidents. Most of the violence happen off camera, Hideki and Ayaka does take center stage. While the couple obsesses in finding the secret of the "Fear Newspaper", they slowly find themselves becoming attached to each other again. The secret of Rei Kigat and the 13-year old boy who aged into an old man within 6 months are the film's major selling points. These scenes are very unnerving as they become revealed as I got closer to the film's climax.The good thing about "Yogen" is that the film does have a solid plot and the rules of the film does have a lot of credibility and answers its own questions. True, the film's script does contain some of the usual histrionics, but I do think "Premonition" is a very good film. The film is nicely paced and pleasingly well-rounded. It contained quite a few surprises and avoids cheap scares. No, there is no long-haired ghost in pale make-up on this one. The film focuses on its characters, its mystery and it's logic does make a whole lot of sense when you put it all together. Rei Kigat and Hideki's fates are quite credible, but it also opens some questions.This is the type of film that the less you know about it, the better the experience will be. Tsurata is to be commended that he managed to generate a feeling of intrigue and genuine creepiness in the film. The film's internal logic and unusual surprises managed to keep me interested for its entirety, despite Mikami's overdone performance. Noriko Sakai is real nice to look at.Whenever you touch a newspaper, do you notice the ink getting on your fingers? You won't look at it the same way again.Highly Recommended! [4- Stars]

However season 6 is when the show started to reach it's peak


One of the reasons why the show peak is because of the fact that the season got moved back due to 9/11 as well as the fact that this season is when KOTH started syndication


But this season proved that this show has alot of potential


Here are the episodes.1.) Bobby Goes Nuts 11/11/2001The episode opens innocently enough with Bobby's girlfriend Connie inviting him over to add some spark to her dying slumber party

There, he quickly masters the technique of targeting an attacker below the belt (while yelling "That's my purse!")

Armed with this training, Bobby makes sure that his next encounter with that crasher has a different outcome
And Hank couldn't be more proud---until he learns the secret of Bobby's success.2.) Soldier of Misfortune 12/9/2001Dale is running for re-election as Gun Club president, but his chances seem to be shot when he accidentally discharges his gun

Cotton becomes jealous that Hank likes Buck better, and Peggy, determined to celebrate Christmas by repairing Hank's relationship with his father, tries to get Hank to tell his father that he loves him
But when the plan backfires, this Christmas problem can only be solved by a carpenter with the initials J.C.: Jimmy Carter.5.) Father of the Bribe  1/6/2002Kahn tries to bribe Bobby to break up with Connie
Connie and Bobby decide to pretend to break up so they can get the money


But when Connie's behavior convinces Kahn and Minh that she is depressed without Bobby, they try to push her and Bobby together

Vayzosa, offers her a chance to get a PhD for only $900, she uses the family savings to pay for it
When Luanne takes the online I.Q

test and also scores as a genius, Peggy realizes that she has been conned, and she comes up with an elaborate sting to get the money back.11.) Unfortunate Son 3/10/2002When Cotton's VFW has to close down due to a shortage of members, Hank tries to get Vietnam vets to join

$review_text.: I had heard references to Marilyn Miller in Sunny, and when I stumbled across this DVD, I thought that it might be interesting to see what the 1920's star was like. Mistake. Although the Amazon site lists Marilyn Miller as being in the film, she most definitely is not - it was made three years after her death. The back of the DVD box says something about "This is a second version of the film starring Marilyn Miller." Ambiguous and misleading.What you get is a terrible DVD. There are no extras - not even anything written on the box other than the misleading back. The visual quality of the film (in black and white despite the cover) is appalling. It looks like something someone filmed as it played on a television - and not a good one.Anna Neagle (mostly of British fame)is Sunny a singer in a southern circus who occasionally slips into her native accent. During Mardi Gras, some lox whose name I have deservedly forgotten falls for her - but she is a circus girl and he is rich. There is - literally - a lot of running around through the same Mardi Gras crowd, before the rich guy can catch Sunny, who has, for no discernible reason, run away from him after they meet and "spoon". He takes her home to the family manse. He has an ogre of an aunt who dominates the family and who almost immediately befriends Sunny. (Most of the cast just stands around. Ray Bolger at his worst does a couple of short dances. Edward Everett Horton, looking more depressed than usual, sits around.)Sunny decides she won't fit in when the clueless circus people arrive in costume, and she runs off. The lox catches her on a river paddle boat, and the aunt, who for some reason is steering the boat, declares she can marry the not so young lovers.By the way this is a musical, but the one song of any note (no pun intended) is "Who" which is never really fully presented. There is some humming by the silhouettes of (lord forgive me) darkies. One black character has a line - "Mammy" gets to say something like "Yazzuh."The sound quality is crummy, and it is hard to see what's going on at times.This movie would be instantly forgettable if it weren't so notably bad. It lingers like the aroma of bad eggs.

$review_text.: Martin Scorsese may not have been a director you would think of making a movie based on a book by Edith Wharton, but I doubt anyone else could have done a better job.  This is a beautifully directed film, gorgeous to look at, with brilliant acting.  Michelle Pfeiffer is very good as the tragic Countess Olenska, whose decision to divorce has caused the scrutiny of New York's social elite and brought her position into question.  Daniel Day-Lewis is good, as well, as Newland Archer, engaged to another but falling desperately in love with Countess Olenska.  Never has removing a glove provided more sexual tension than the scene in this film!  I loved this movie when I first saw it and I still enjoy it as much.  With a talented supporting cast (Wynona Ryder as May, and narrated by Joanne Woodward) this film is a classic.
$SUMMARY.: Scorsese and Wharton?  A match made in heaven!

$review_text.: Closer to 3 and a half stars than 4 (3.65).A rather short unrated adult "comedy" based on the series of adult graphic novels by Milo Manara that go under the name "Click." Lots of nudity and "action."  The film is also known as: "Click: The Ultimate Attraction," and "Click: The Body Beautiful."  The movie has a copyright of 2002, but there are a series of 7 90 minute TV movies that were made in 1997 based on "Click", and "Ultimate Attraction" might be one of those TV movies.DVD Features: The DVD contains the movie, biographies, and available hits (4 trailers including "Ultimate Attraction," "Midnight Tease 2," "Knocking on Death's Door," and "Emmanuelle: First Contact.")Credits: Stars: Gabriella Hall (Linda - trainer; "Erotic Misadventures of the Invisible Man" and over 30 other films and TV series), David Chielens (Ben), Nina Leichtling (Margo; "Anywhere but Here"), Jacqueline Lovell (Susan; "Lolita 2000"), Rick Jordan (Ted Fields; "Click: For the Love of the Click"), Robert Donovan (William Haywood - spa owner; "Shadow Dancer") and Taylor St.Claire (New Linda).  The director is Rafael Glenn.  Interesting, it would appear that financing came from Ireland-Holland-France & the USA.Plot: A failing gym/spa tries to keep in business, and keep from being taken over, by using an electronic device to make customers very very "excited."  The device literally fell from the sky, dropped through the toilet by a man trying to prevent its capture by the police.Review: Unlike the other movie that I have reviewed based on a Manara series; I've read the "Click" series of books. While both the movie and the books use an electronic device, the books require an actual implantation of a receiver into the brain.  The movie does not require this operation for the device to cause an individual to be infected by "adult happy" vibes.  Both include at least one prudish woman that is "changed."  The "victim" was the "good" person in the book, not the manipulators like in the movie.  This movie does not really have the feel of a Manara book (though the books aren't all great).  And unlike that other movie, this one jumps immediately into nudity and "adult fun time."The movie feels a lot longer than it actually is because the "adult fun" nude scenes just go on way too long, and actually becomes a little boring (it has to say something that I found myself fast forwarding through the overly long nude scenes, and there's at least one scene that I didn't fast forward through more because of the music than the action; and several of the "good" scenes are fuzzy or foggy).  That and there is a lot less "mainstream" scenes in this movie than there probably should be.  The movie does seem to be a step above a movie with just nude scenes with filler, but it isn't that far away from that type of movie.Some of the acting isn't that bad, some is like something like you might find on a soap opera, and some is quite bad (though one on of the stars obviously knows how to act).  I believe this film occurred after "Erotic Misadventures of the Invisible Man."  If I'm right, then Hall's acting has regressed (and maybe shows why she stars in these types of movies and gets bit parts in mainstream movies).  The plot is very thin, nothing more than a means to have nudity and adult fun.  The humor is quite thin in this adult comedy, though there appear to be parts that seem as if they are supposed to be funny.  The sound made by the active device is very irritating.  Most of the women are attractive, and while it is harder for me to tell, most of the men seem to fall into the less attractive category (at least two might fall into the handsome category).  Hall is a rather attractive woman, a "real" looking woman (other than the overly endowed top (that's before the "large balloons" gag, during which she is gigantic, clothed, but gigantic, at which point her "natural" size doesn't look as large)), but she does appear to be a little too fleshy to be an overly tight/fit fitness trainer, like she is supposed to be.  The film inserts some common San Francisco scenes to remind the audience that the film is supposed to occur in that city.  Overall, starts slow and some of the scenes are just too long.  (3.65)

$review_text.: I'm a musician, and music fan in general.  I love progressive rock (ELP, Yes, early Genesis -- the usual suspects) as well as many other types of rock, other genres, etc.  This is probably my 5th ELP DVD, and it finally gives me what I've been waiting for -- the band in its magnificent early-to-mid 70's heyday.  Never mind the grainy video quality and jumpy edits of some of the footage -- who cares?  The point here is not to show off your plasma TV or surround system -- the point is to witness a historical artifact of sorts, a window back in time to an incredible (and sadly lost) era of true musicianship and vision in the world of popular music.  It was a time when musicians (and yes, they were virtuoso musicians then, with no shame attached to the title) could experiment and create astonishingly fresh and innovative music, to a public that was not brainwashed by media empires, and who eagerly accepted the works of these gifted masters.  It wasn't "uncool" to be a recognized craftsman with your instrument (or voice).  It wasn't "required" to conform to the mass media's idea of "what pop should sound like".  It wasn't necessary to stick to the same production techniques, the same in-your-face compression on every band's vocals, the same drum loops and sampled blasts of noise used over and over (loops and samples didn't exist; there were actual humans who actually played their instruments).I won't attempt to repeat what has already been said about this DVD -- but one of the things that most impressed me was the Bonus Footage on Disc 1, called "ELP rehearsing in 1973" (!).  It actually showed the band in the studio, painstakingly going over an intricate passage from Brain Salad Surgery's "Karn Evil 9, 2nd Impression.  From our vantage point of the present, one tends to look back upon works like these as "immortal; set in stone; eternal".  But the reality was that they were written, and orchestrated, and arranged, by actual guys in their early 20's, joking around in a studio, and coming up - note by note - with pieces of music that would be destined (unbeknown to them at the time) to become classic and, yes, immortal.  It would be like "seeing" a young Mozart sitting in his music room, composing one his great works, one note at a time, and seeing just how "human" he really was -- how young, how silly, how brilliant.  That's what this was like -- it injected a dimension of humanity and reality into a piece of music that I tend to think of as "larger than life".It's also funny how we tend to think of our heroes as "aging as we do", and thus always being our contemporaries.  Of course, in the chronological sense, we all do age on the same timeline.  But the Keith Emerson that composed Tarkus was a young, brash  guy in his mid-20's.  The Greg Lake that penned "Still...You Turn me On" was - to me, now 46, just a kid.  It's strange that a 46-year old's "heroes" are all "kids"...!Buy this DVD.  Don't get it for the immaculate picture or the razor-sharp editing -- they aren't there.  Instead, look at it as a window into the musical past -- a past of stupendous freedom and creativity that, with the onset of an interconnected, Internet-based, individuality-smothering society, may never be again.

My girls thought it was pretty good (they're seven), but I felt like the magic of the previous Pixar movies was lost this time around (I guess it was the same with Cars 2 though).

$review_text.: As nearly everyone knows, this movie is about a mob family, and the movie is wonderfully crafted in every aspect


 I found it gripping from start to finish


 The focus is clearly on the men in the family, since the female characters are hardly developed

 Superficially, one might be tempted to say that this is just a story about a particular group of criminals, but of course there's much more to it than that; indeed, this movie is an iconic classic for good reasons.Rather than attempting to write a thorough review which winds up just echoing what countless others have already said a million times, let me first highlight what I personally find to be the most striking aspect of the movie, namely the moral contradiction of these people

 On the one hand, they care for honor, they love their families, they respect traditions, they're nominally religious, they have a sense of responsibility as citizens, and they have a strong work ethic as businessmen (talk about high-stress jobs!)

 But on the other hand, they resort to crime, terrorism, violence, and murder to attain money and power, thus being quite willing to disregard social norms and laws as they deem necessary

 I think many of us are fascinated by this juxtaposition because we all experience at least some degree of moral contradiction in our lives (after all, tough moral choices involving tradeoffs are routine), so a key contribution of these intense characters and circumstances is that they make explicit a tension we're all intuitively familiar with.Another theme which jumped out at me is that the mob is able to coerce even very wealthy and powerful people through violence or the threat of violence

 This is possible because they have an extensive and disciplined organizational structure which enables them to both circumvent law enforcement and apply force which no individual can resist (if you fight back against a mobster, you're fighting his entire mob family).Overall, this isn't a movie one simply recommends


 Rather, everyone needs to watch it at least once as part of their cultural education
 Also, this movie has much in common with "The Sopranos" series, so be sure to watch that series if you like this movie (in my opinion, it may be the best dramatic TV series ever made).

If you like the Golden Child, Sword and the Sorcerer, Princess Bride and movies that came from the 80's that were unabashedly campy you will love this one.Though I do give the movie a 5 star from mostly nostalgia and my complete inability to be objective about things from my youth that make me happy to do have to mention that if you like watching the commentary on a movie you love, you are unlikely to like this one. I really didn't like it, they talked about more of what was going on with them at the time of the recording and not what was going on in the scene.

$REVIEW.: &#34;Bill Cosby...Far From Finished&#34; comes as a fitting end to the Bill Cosby Standup Trilogy.  The first installment being the infamous 1983 release &#34;Bill Cosby, Himself&#34; that is undeniably one of the best examples of stand up comedy there is and the other being a not so well known and never mentioned nor ever released on DVD special from 1987 called &#34;49.&#34;  It is widely available on YouTube---I suggest you check it out.When you look at all 3 of these specials you see how much they all tie together.  Cosby in each of these specials discusses topics that are important to him at that particular time.  In &#34;Himself&#34; he talks about childhood, his parents, life, marriage and having children.  In &#34;49&#34; he discusses reaching middle age and the trials of getting older even though you're young at heart.  And here in &#34;Far From Finished&#34; he celebrates life as seen by someone in their seventies.  Life changes as we get older and The Cos is the perfect person to guide us through it all.Everyone is focused on how clean the comedy is and while that is definitely something that should be noted--the one factor people should really take note is just how amazingly crisp Bill Cosby's comedy still is today in 2013.  The guy has been at this for more than 50 years---and it would be an understatement to say that he &#34;knows what he's doing.&#34;  Yes he does but he's also doing what very few other people are doing.Bill Cosby's comedy style is radically different from many other popular comedians.  His comedy does not consist of quick one-liners that he rattles off one after the other.  Listening to Bill Cosby is like watching a beautiful sunset...there is no rush to get it over with--instead you sit and enjoy the beautiful sight in front of you.  Cosby's comedy pieces are long, incredibly detailed and very well organized.  The pacing is slower than most comedy specials because Cosby's comedy demands it.  He's a master weaver of story and as a storyteller, he takes care of his audience.  The audience is right there with him and that makes for an incredibly personal connection.They filmed two shows for this DVD.  I attended the 3pm taping earlier that day and from what I can see, most if not all of the material on this DVD/BluRay comes entirely from the 7pm taping later that day.  Two completely different sets.  Any other comedian would have said &#34;Well, let me do my same set twice...so if there's anything I missed or flubbed at the 3pm show...we can grab from the 7pm show to edit together&#34;  Not Cosby.  The 3pm show was nothing like the performance on this DVD from the 7pm show. This guy is such a pro that it boggles the mind how he's able to do this all so effortlessly.This special is hilarious and for any students of comedy: incredibly educational.  You're watching a master at work here.  Thank goodness we have Bill Cosby.

$review_text.: Cain and Mabel are Clark Gable and Marion Davies in a 1936 romantic comedy about a prize fighter and a showgirl, from Warner Brothers and directed by Lloyd Bacon.Clark Gable (1901-60) was one of the biggest stars of the 20th century, and a pretty good actor to boot. He's best remembered as Rhett Butler for "GWTW" (1939), for which he received one of his three Oscar nominations (the other nomination was for 1935's "Mutiny on the Bounty" and he won in 1934 for "It Happened One Night"), but he gave us many memorable performances in films like "Teachers' Pet" (1958) and "But Not for Me" (1959) both of which earned him Golden Globe nominations. My favorite Gable flick is "Run Silent Run Deep" (1958).In 1936 Gable was at the peak of his powers and in 1938 he was crowned "King of Hollywood" by his good friend Spencer Tracey. "Cain and Mabel" was his 32nd film. This was his second and final pairing with Marion Davies - they worked together on "Polly of the Circus" (1931).Marion Davies (1897-1961) is best known as the mistress of William Randolph Hearst. She started in silent films in 1916 and first worked for Hearst in 1918. She moved between romantic comedies and lavish costume dramas, and when Hearst  and Irving Thalberg quarreled, Hearst moved his Cosmopolitan Pictures from MGM to Warners, where this film was made. Following "Cain and Mabel" she made one more film in 1937 ("Ever Since Eve") and then retired.The film co-stars Roscoe Karns as a publicity man and Allen Jenkins as Gable's trainer.Roscoe Karns (1891-1970) was famous for his machine gun delivery, usually as the sidekick of the leading man. He's best known for films like "It Happened One Night" (1934), "His Girl Friday" (1940), and "Woman of the Year" (1942).Allen Jenkin's (1900-1974) long face was seen in more than 100 films, often as a criminal, and including "I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" (1932), "Dead End" (1937), and "The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse" (1938). He's best known for his recurring role as Muggsy in "The Red Skeleton Hour" (1954-62).Lloyd Bacon (1889-1955) directs. Bacon directed more than 100 films between 1922 and 1954, the most famous of which are "42nd Street" (1933), "A Slight Case of Murder" (1938), "Brother Orchid" (1940), and "Footsteps in the Dark" (1941). He was not typically known for any style, but as a working director who could make a film within budget and time constraints.The film has nothing to recommend it. The plot is downright silly and Marion Davies, at the end of a long career, seems disinterested in the role, despite how yummy Clark Gable appears. The public apparently agreed. Despite the presence of Gable, who appeared in the years' #1 and #10 top grossing films ("San Francisco" and "Wife vs. Secretary"), the film didn't do well at the box office and it received no major Academy Award  nominations.Bear in mind, 1936 was a great year for films, with such memorable movies as Chaplin's "Modern Times",  William Powell's bravura performance in "The Great Zigfield" (winner of Best Picture and Best Actress), Garbo's "Camille", Errol Flynn and Olivia deHaviland in "Charge of the Light Brigade", and Cukor's "Romeo and Juliette" in which a fading John Barrymore gave his last great performance. When measured against films like this, "Cain and Mabel" seems weak indeed.

It is a well made story, though I am not sure what the story is. It is entertaining and it makes some effort with creating an appropriate atmosphere including the way it is told by a narrator. The movie has some highlights (I esp. like the scene where half of his head slips off)  but it lacks from the absence of a "hero(ine)" or whatever central character to identify with. It would make a good pc-game without much alteration.

$REVIEW.: I really didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie.  People tried to explain it to me, but they couldn't really convey in normal conversation the true twisted plot of this movie.Two guys are chained in a disgusting bathroom together, and they have to crack clues and solve some pretty twisted puzzles to prove that they want to stay alive.  Supposedly these guys don't know each other...or do they?During the movie, you may THINK you have it figured out.  I don't know if the writers make it seem incredibly predictable on purpose...or if it kind of just happened.  It's hard to tell.  Once I DID think that I had it figured out...I thought that would either be a really incredible plot twist or a SMASHING surprise ending.The movie doesn't really satisfy in that way.  There is a plot twist and a surprise ending, but it's only mildy entertaining. What I did like about this movie was the incredibly twisted and wierd mind of this serial killer...and the stomach churning gory scenes.  It truly entertains for the "Seven" lovers in us.For a low-budge movie, Saw isn't half bad.  There ARE better movies for those of us that enjoy this kind of thing, but it's worth giving Saw a watch if even for the sh-t's and giggles.

$REVIEW.: Criterion's announcment that they will be releasing a package of three of Josef Von Sternberg's silent masterpieces is one of the greatest pieces of news to come out of the home video front in some time.  And if Criterion does their usual impeccable job in regard to transfers and supplements, then the results should be satisfactory to everyone.  Speaking as one who has lived with Paramount's old VHS versions of DOCKS OF NEW YORK and THE LAST COMMAND for over twenty years now, it will be very interesting to see the films with music other than the Gaylord Carter organ scores that were attached to those releases; one hopes that the new scores that Criterion has commissioned for this release are at least as good as the ones Carter did (especially in regard to DOCKS).  In any case, the films themselves are visually superb, and among the finest examples (along with William Wellman's still unavailible on DVD WINGS and the equally elusive THE WEDDING MARCH directed by Erich Von Strohiem) of silent film artistry in the late 1920's.  These films are elegant and eloquent without any talk; indeed, any talk in them would have destroyed the beautifully evocative moods that Von Sternberg creates.  This set should be a must for anyone who loves film, and I cannot wait to get my copy.

$REVIEW.: I had written earlier in my review of the first series that I didn't like Red Dwarf. If you look at my review there, you'd see that I thought it simply wasn't funny and I don't get what the fuss is all about. And I wrote the entire series off and went to watch The Brittas Empire instead.Later, I decided to come back to Red Dwarf, and watch Series 5, reasoning that by this time, they would most likely have gotten a handle on how to do it right. Although I still stand by what I thought of Series 1, oh man, I thought Series 5 is everything Series 1 was not. It's funny, clever, intelligent, engaging and not annoying at all. In fact, I LOVE it.And after immersing myself in episodes from Series 4, 5, 6 and now 7, I have to say it's one of my most favorite series ever. I'm a life long Star Trek fan, and what I say would be blasphemy I'm sure, but there are many instances in this show where they leave Star Trek in the dust in terms of concepts, storytelling, and simple bravery in the kinds of stories they have the audacity to tell.

$review_text.: I found Pirates of the Caribbean_The Curse of the Black Pearl a wonderfully fun movie.  I love the wonderful characterization that Johnny Dep does of Captain Jack Sparrow.  Know for odd-ball roles, he is finally found one where he has hit star status, which has been long overdue.  Keira Knightley is wonderful to see in action and is going to be a big star quickly as she, for her youth, is quite an accomplished actress.  Orlando, whom was wonderful as the elf, Legolas, in the Lord of the Rings, whose carreer as an actor actually go its take off in that trilogy, likewise is great as the young love interest and heroe that is trying to save the Governor' (played with a properly tongue in cheek aplumb by Jonathan Price, who tickled my funny bone) daughter, Keira's character.  Orlando really learned a lot from LOR stint and is growing into being as great an actor as Leonardo Decaprio.  Look out Leo, you got competition coming up.  Jeffrey Rush as Barbosa was a wonderfully devious and sinister yet farcicle Captain of the Black Pearl.  The effects are superb and they really worked flawlessly with the movie.I found the behind the scenes extras very informative and fun to watch, as much as the movie itself.I enjoyed the whole package and can't wait for all the others to be added to my collection.  And to think that this was inspired by a Disneyland ride/ attraction.

$REVIEW.: Sometimes you watch a film without expectation and find yourself more than merely invested but moved by the intimate and honest nature of the film itself.  It can be one of the most rewarding experiences in life, to sit back and become pulled into the very fabric of a film, the very `being' it processes.  That happened for me last night, while I was watching `Tea and Sympathy', a little known gem from director Vincente Minnelli.  In fact, until last night I hadn't ever heard of the movie.  As a fan of Deborah Kerr, I was interested in seeing it, but I had no idea what I was about to watch and had zero expectation walking in.`Tea and Sympathy' may be one of the most powerful portraits of bullying, loneliness, tolerance and sexual identity ever put to film.Some will balk at this.  Some will say that the film is dated and that its presentation of homosexuality is stilted or false, but one also has to remember the time in which a film like this was being made.  In the 50's, it was extremely taboo to tackle these themes.  In fact, it is still to a small degree considered taboo today.  It was very hard to express sympathy or tolerance for those struggling with their own personal feelings and identity because there was very little tolerance to be found.  That is why a film like `Tea and Sympathy' is so important and so powerful.  It may not address certain issues with definite clarity (it never once mentions the word homosexual or even gay) and yet in doing such it actually speaks to a larger audience.  It makes the core theme of bullying a more universal subject, and in doing so it becomes a more powerful and more effective film.The core story is that of seventeen year-old Tom Lee.  Attending a prep school and living in a boarding house co-habited by his headmaster, Mr. Reynolds, Tom is having a very hard time fitting in.  He isn't interested in the many activities of his peers.  He doesn't want to play sports of climb mountains.  Instead, he dreams of being a folk singer and indulges in the company of women, mostly the headmaster's wife Laura.  Because of this, Tom is constantly teased by his peers.  They label him `Sister Boy', questioning his sexuality and manliness and treating him like an outcast.  They harass and terrorize him whenever possible.But Laura's life isn't so glamorous either.  Her husband, headmaster Bill, is a guarded man who treats her more like an object or property and less like a wife.  He shuns her affections and spends his free time entertaining his students, taking them on hikes and trips and inviting them to the house.  He spends no alone time with Laura and seems to be uninterested in her sexually.  Seeking affection, and desiring to give someone affection herself, Laura finds herself gravitating towards Tom, who is in desperate need of some sympathy.The film is a very bold look at the destructive nature of bullying and preconceived notions of what an individual is supposed to be.  As we look at the people around Tom and the way the react to him, we can see those same actions taking place today, which makes a film like this relevant to modern society.  In a world where bullying is becoming an even bigger problem, it is interesting to see a film made in the 50's tackling, with such brazen honesty, the downward spiral associated with the act.  As Tom's world collapses under his own frustrated depressions, we are crushed by his reality.The scene where he attempts suicide is a tragic reminder that these issues are far from `a thing of the past'.Some have taken issue with the way that homosexuality is handled here, stating that the issue is merely skirted around and that the insinuation that `walking a certain way' makes you a certain way is insulting.  I don't see it this way.  For me, the film works brilliantly within the unfair constraints and censorship of the time working against it.  There were certain aspects of the stage play that apparently couldn't be included in the film (anyone familiar with Tennessee Williams' stage plays and film adaptations should be aware that this issue was commonplace in the 40's and 50's), but I feel that the film does a marvelous job of working around that fact, allowing the meat of the story to film every frame.In not addressing the obvious directly, `Tea and Sympathy' paints a wider portrait of oppression and tolerance.  The fact remains that not every quiet boy who would rather sing than play football is gay, and the way that `Tea and Sympathy' broaches Tom's demeanor, his shyness and his uncomfortable, awkward advances towards women could honestly be something altogether NOT what one would expect.  But it is more than just Tom's experience being looked at here.  The characters of Bill and of Tom's roommate Al also color different aspects of manliness and sexual identity.  Al is painted as a sympathizer, but he is also controlled by his fear or what others may think of him.  He hesitates to do what is in his heart because he is afraid of being condemned.  But it is Bill who is the real point of interest.  His reluctance to embrace his wife speaks volumes for his abrupt masculinity, a mask he uses to shield himself from his internal torment over not `wanting to want' what he obviously wants.The character of Laura is an interesting one, because one can almost wade through her sweet sincerity to find a near selfishness, a need to find comfort and solace in her time of despair and in her final letter to Tom one can almost sense that she understands that her actions were damaging, despite appearing to be cleansing and healing on the outset.Vincente Minnelli does a masterful job of bringing awareness to a taboo subject, using a visual intensity to further cast that lot.  I found it quite jarring that throughout the entirety of the film I barely saw young John Kerr's face.  He was always so downtrodden and outwardly oppressed, but in the climactic scene in the woods with Deborah Kerr, the light came down through the trees and highlighted his face and it was almost like Minnelli was allowing us to fully grasp the boy's vindication.I don't know what else I can say.  This film touched me in a way I didn't expect, and I'm saddened that it doesn't have a larger audience.  Sure, some of the approaches may be dated, but the film is far more poignant that many give it credit for, and as a statement piece of a period behind us, it brilliantly addresses a universal problem that is still very prevalent and thus expresses concern that is still very relevant.  Whether you consider Tom, Al or Bill (or all three of them) as closeted homosexuals, `Tea and Sympathy' does a miraculous job of shading three very different men suffering from a very similar issue, that of self and social tolerance, and gives us a way of seeing three differing vantage points, all of them observed by a woman suffering from her own life obstacles.At the end of the day, `Tea and Sympathy' is a film about hurting and overcoming that hurt to finally accept oneself for who one truly is.

I wish he had sung on every episode of the last season. He was only on 10 episodes. I can't figure out why he wasn't on more episodes. I usually don't want any bonus material except maybe extra episodes of other shows or cartoons, but in this case I wish they had put a bonus of Ricky singing. Where you could "play all" his songs.

The story was ok; it was typical of the goofy original, but was a bit foul.  No 99 and no mention of her and foul humor took the magic away from the original.

$REVIEW.: Whatever your thoughts on the original movie, last year's The Italian Job has very little in common with it, only referencing the former once when talking about car chases.  If anything, this seems to have been influenced by Ocean's Eleven more than anything else in it's efforts to be achingly cool.  Unfortunately it just doesn't succeed.  The plot is minimal, but that's not really the complaint given the fact that you don't go and see this kind of film for the plot.  You go to see it for the action, and here's it's pretty stinted and unexciting.  The direction is so sloppy that virtually no tension is built up in the various heist sequences, and the beautiful Venice backdrop is barely utilised at all.  More importanly, the return of the Mini chase sequence is distinctly lacklustre.  In recent years both The Rock and The Bourne Identity have given us much better car chase scenes, and this one really falls flat.In many ways it's a shame this isn't any better, because its cast really is superb.  If you can forget about the wooden star quality of Mark Wahlberg, then you've got Oscar-winner Charlize Theron and Oscar-nominee Edward Norton is supporting roles.  Unfortunately both actors aren't given nearly as much screen time as you might like, Norton's role amounting to little more than a cameo.  Contractually obliged to take the role, this is least distinguished role yet, a shame given the fact he is such an astounding talent.  Anyone wanting to see him in better roles would do better to check out American History X or 25th Hour.  Perhaps surprisingly, the best performances come from the minor players of the crack team.  Seth Green really hits his stride here, capitalising on his Austin Powers and Buffy fame to give the few laughs the film contains.  Jason Stratham is also very good, though his persona from Snatch may wear thin before too long.Like I said, the main problem with The Italian Job is that it's so boring, overlong, cheesy and unexciting.  There are heaps better action movies out there - Speed and True Lies spring to mind - and as far as heist movies go, Ocean's Eleven, and even the uneven The Score, have this beat.  This is bland anodyne Hollywood stuff, and it's particularly offensive for its waste of good talent.

Man, you can see the band is clearly enjoying themselves, otherwise they should win the OScar! Drummer Max Weinberg's enthusiasm is breathtaking.I'm still catching my breath after watching this marvellous double DVD
The Boss's voice still is strong and emotional, even at 52

VAn Zandt is charismatic
Nils adds a lot to the band.How can a band put out such an emotional  performance night after night on tour is something incredible

Yes, tehy're being paid for that, but that's not the point


THey could get the job done without sweating so much and nobody would notice it.I have only two negative comments: the version of THE RIVER is too much watered down, too much sugar, too much slow


I hated it


Secondly, The Boss really does not know how to play a guitar solo

Horrible ones he did here.

$review_text.: Thunderheart is one those rare films that takes real life events and strings them together in a short space of time so that viewers get a clear picture of the people and the issues faced


Based off of a number of events that happened in the mid seventies, you see the Leonard Peltier incident, the siege at Wounded Knee between Indians and Federal Agents and you see an approximation regarding the murder of Anna Mae Aquash because she was talking about uranium
 Graham Greene plays Walter Crow Horse, Val Kilmer is Agent Lavoi and former AIM Chairman, John Trudell - who was there for many of these events and then some - plays Jimmy Loooks Twice

 All are fabulous in their respective roles


This film gives a very good synopsis as to what First Nations peoples face to this day with regard to sovereignty, land rights, and just outright survival of both their culture and the People themselves.When you grow up in an Indigenous household and you saw these events being reported in the various tribal newspapers of the era as well as on the news or hearing your relatives talk about them, it realy hits home in a big way
 These are images and events that will be with me my entire life because some of us were keenly awre of them

 It is refreshing to see the story be told in a way that is not pure Hollywood hype as some reviewers have charged

I am not sure that the movie was meant to be entertainment as much as to be a cinematic record of these events that have gotten far less attention than what they deserve.

$REVIEW.: "Saturday Night Live: The Complete Fourth Season"  is a seven-disc box set containing all the shows from the 1978-1979 season.  This is one of the great years of the NBC sketch comedy show, which has just passed its 33rd anniversary.  Maybe it's nostalgia, but it seems the comedy landed a lot more frequently then than in the current season of "SNL."Some of the skits in this set include Nick the Lounge Singer (Bill Murray singing the "Star Wars" theme to a uninterested cocktail lounge audience), Candy Slice (Gilda Radner), The Loud Family (Jane Curtin), Fred Garvin: Male Prostitute (Dan Aykroyd), and the Nerds (Bill Murray and Gilda Radner).  Also included is the "Wild and Crazy" Festrunk Brothers (Steve Martin, Dan Aykroyd) and Buck Henry's inappropriate "Uncle Roy."  Guest hosts include Fred Willard, Carrie Fisher, Kate Jackson, Gary Busey, and Walter Matthau.  Musical guests include Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones, the Doobie Brothers, Bette Midler, Talking Heads, Devo, Van Morrison, the Grateful Dead, James Taylor, and Rickie Lee Jones.

$review_text.: The cast, while not exactly box-office gold, is impeccable. Not one of them could give a bad performance if they tried. And, the film has some important things to say about stereotyping, racial profiling, and jumping to conclusions that, in today's climate, NEED to be said. So it's more than a little disappointing that the writing and direction are so, basically, pedestrian.Is Cheadle's character a terrorist? Or a patriot? Are terrorists monsters or, if you're on their side, patriots? Does the end justify the means? What if the end is vile to us, but not to others? Don't worry, I'm not going to answer any of these questions. The problem is, neither does the film or, more accurately, the answers it offers are either glib or non-responsive to the bigger picture it tries to present. Nevertheless, it is a far more worthy use of any thinking person's time than a whole slew of bigger, more successful at the box office, flicks. An honorable failure... but, yes, a failure, nonetheless.

$review_text.: XXXXXThis movie is based on the book "Casino Royale" (1953) by the late Ian Fleming.  It is the 21ST  "official" (meaning EON Productions) Bond movie with Daniel Craig being the 6TH actor to play James Bond.Before this movie came out, Bond movies covered a period of 40 years beginning with 1962's "Dr. No" and ending with 2002's "Die Another Day."This movie is about James Bond receiving his "double oh" status and completing his first mission as "007."The movie's strong points are that it has a lot of action and good special effects.  In fact, before explaining anything to the viewer, there is a long chase scene with death-defying leaps and bounds.  It is quite well done.  There is another long chase scene that follows this chase.  It, too, is quite well done.Unfortunately, the story is difficult to follow and is somewhat complicated.  In fact, I had to view this movie twice in order to completely understand it.It is after about 50 minutes (that's right, 50 minutes!!) into this long movie that you actually learn exactly who Bond was chasing both times and you learn the details of Bond's first assignment.You have to understand two things in order to understand Bond's first assignment: the basics of how stock options work and the basics of a poker game called "Texas Hold'Em" (a variation of the poker game called seven card stud).  This, personally, is why I'm amazed that this movie has received such high ratings from others--I don't believe that all people who view this movie know such things.  For the record, I know the basics of these things and, in fact, my interest increased at this point.For Bond's first assignment we're told what he has to do.  Oddly enough, we're not told why he has to do it.  I found this frustrating and had to guess why he was on this assignment.  It turns out I guessed right by reading some articles about this movie after I had viewed it.  The point is that you will have to do some guessing while watching this movie.You may need a brochure to figure out all the bad guys that pop in and out.  The main villain seems to be someone called Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), "private banker to the world's terrorists."  What I noticed is that this villain is not very villainous (except in his last few scenes).The Bond girl has the name of Vesper Lyn (Eva Green).  She's integral to the plot and especially to the movie's long, somewhat predictable, ending.  The ending reminded me of the 1969 Bond movie called "On Her Majesty's Secret Service."  Sean Connery who was playing Bond at the time wisely did not perform in this movie.When viewing this movie, don't expect to see the James Bond that you've seen in the last forty years.  There is no Miss Moneypenny, no gun barrel walk, no Q and, thus no gadgets.  (Apparently in the book, Q is not mentioned so there are no gadgets.  Actually, there is a gadget that Bond in this movie uses extensively--a cell phone.)In my mind's eye, I compared Daniel Craig to the other five Bond actors that came before him (namely Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan).  In my opinion, he doesn't fit the mold of a James bond.  Sure, he's physically fit but there's more to Bond than just being fit!  (Actually, Craig does look like Bond in the last thirty seconds of the movie.)I also missed the Bond music.  The background music is good but does not compare to the distinctive music associated with James Bond movies. (Bond-type music is played when the end credits roll.)The thing I missed most is the James Bond witticisms and snappy dialogue.  For example, here is some dialogue from 1964's "Goldfinger" where Bond is tied down on a gold slab with a laser beam cutting the slab and slowly inching up threatening to cut Bond in half:Bond says to Goldfinger: "You don't expect me to talk, do you?"Goldfinger's priceless reply:  "No, Mr. Bond.  I expect you to DIE."Now, this movie is not entirely devoid of humor but it's not nearly as witty as expected.Filming for this movie took place in the Czech Republic, Bahamas, Italy, and England.Finally, the DVD (the one released March, 2007) I have is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are several interesting extras included on a second disc.In conclusion, for those who are not James Bond fans and looking to see a good action movie, this is the film to see.  However, many true Bond fans may ask themselves the following:"Is this a James Bond movie or is this an action movie that happens to have somebody named James Bond in it?"(2006;  2 hr, 25 min;  wide screen;  2 discs;  28 scenes)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko or "Uncle Stevie," London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX

$review_text.: This is as exciting as an unmanned space program can get. Two rovers on Mars, on opposite sides of the planet so that one is in daylight while the other is in darkness. The people in Mission Control in Houston personify these robots to the extent of talking about them being awake and asleep, of being "out of his mind" when one goes bad, and treat them like their babies. Which, after all, they are.This was the mission that found unmistakable evidence that there used to be open water on Mars. The audience follows their fragments of evidence, their decisions to probe in a particular spot, use particular instruments, and so on. And these guys (and gals) are apparently quite accustomed to explaining what they are doing in ways that make sense to non-scientists.They clearly love their work. They celebrate when things go right with hugs and pizza, and comfort one another when things go wrong. All together, it is a fascinating look into discovery, and convinces any reasonable person that we must plan on sending manned missions to Mars as soon as we can.

$REVIEW.: Ok OK, why did I watch this? I gave the last 2 previous films 1 star each (wanted to give half a star to both to be honest).I must say, I was pleased to find out they weren't carrying on with the 'Fairy Secret' storyline, which was a sequel to 'Fashion Fairytale'. This is not the same girl, or is it?! The Fashion Fairytale Barbie said she 'acted' in all the Barbie films...confusing really!Upon first seeing the cover of this DVD, I was yet again disgusted, "Another 'Plastic' and superficial tale" I thought. I was also angry they were keeping at the stories with these superficial plots and also Barbie's new look and voice judging by the glamourous DVD art. But I gave it a shot anyway.Upon the first few minutes I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Yeah, I did not like the tacky 'Princess School' idea. But at least It didn't seem totally fashion related.Boy oh boy..was I wrong! It wasn't too long into the story that it suddenly got plastic. It happened so fast I couldn't keep up! One second you see the girl in her house, next second you see her whisked off to 'Princess School' on a carriage and you see the area where she lives...graffiti and all, looks like a very run-down area. Then it gets plastic, the annoying fairies are back again too! This time they do sneaky deeds to bad characters and also help out with outfits which instantly disappointed me.Overall the story WAS Better than the previous 2. I don't know if Mattel were trying, but it was better. But still not good enough. I did like how they told Barbie 'No one can make you inferior but yourself'. Which was good for children, but they did not incorporate it in a nice enough way as there was still so much nastiness and bullying towards Barbie as they told her this and even after they said it. Which didn't make that moral stand out. I think the film had too much bullying and cattiness.I also did not like how Barbie was so willing to just go to this 'Charm School' when her adopted mother appeared sick and Barbie seemed to be the only income supporting the family. It was really unrealistic and just upsetting. It didn't seem so safe either, considering it looks like they live in an area of crime judging by the look of the area they live in.I give the film 2 stars as at least it wasn't completely fashion related as the previous 2 and the fairies weren't so prominent in this film. But still not enough heart and morals to give it any higher sadly.As an adult, I will always remember and treasure the original tales I felt taught children good lessons. It was not about how to do things 'properly' and being 'perfect' like the messages come across in this film, but about standing up yourself, being brave, kind, caring and doing things for friends.I could tolerate the new look, new voice and just overall 'NEW' Barbie they are marketing if they made her role model material and not 'marketing' material for money. I really miss Kelly Sheridan, she made the stories more 'Magic'. But even adding her voice to the last 3 films won't do anything to these I'm afraid.I'd personally suggest the original stories up to The Diamond Castle (I don't think Thumbelina, Mermaid Tale or the 3 Musketeers were very good). They taught great morals for girls I think!

$REVIEW.: I am a big comic book fan and i love the punisher. This movie fell a little short to me in a couple areas. The main area was the special effects of the movie. The movie is very gory like the punisher would be in the comics, but the special effects looked similar to a 90's horror film. A lot of really fake looking blood and fake looking body parts getting blown off. In this day and age with technology the death scenes should have been much better and not so cheesy. The story was just ok to me. There wasn't anything in regards to the story that would make me want to watch this movie over and over again. This version of the punisher is slightly better than the last two versions, but that isn't saying much. The movie isn't a complete waste of time if you go into watching it knowing it isn't going to be a great movie.

$REVIEW.: This collection has the brilliant Fugitive Alien movies, and a featurette with Sandy Frank.  I don't think Mr. Frank was too thrilled with the MST treatment of his movies, and they were a bit personal at time, but I suspect based on his other comments, he was happy to take their money.  And one of the best songs ever about forklift murder.Samson vs. The Vampire Women - actually, not that bad for a movie about a Mexican wrestler and terribad vampires.  Frank's departure didn't stand out to me, surprisingly.  I guess I expected more.The Sword and the Dragon is a delightful movie - love those Russo-Finnish epics.

$review_text.: &quot;Blue Steel&quot; was the fifth of the sixteen B Westerns that John Wayne made for the poverty row studio Lone Star/Monogram from 1933 to 1935.  Wayne plays U.S. Marshal  John Carruthers who shows up in town just after Danti (Yakima Canutt), the Polka Dot Bandit has robbed a safe.  While Carruthers is investigating the robbery he is seen by Sheriff Jake Withers (George Hayes before his &quot;Gabby&quot; days) and about to be arrested.  But then Carruthers saves Withers' life and they learn they are on the same side.  Carruthers then learns about Malgrove (Edward Peil), the big shot in town, who is trying to take over all of the ranches by having his gang stop all the wagons trains heading to town with supplies.  It seems there is gold under them thar hills and Malgrove wants it all.  The ranchers are about to cave in to Melgrove when the marshal and the sheriff come up with a plan to get the needed supplies to town in this above average 54-minute western.Written and directed by Robert N. Bradbury, who did most of Wayne's Lone Star Westerns, &quot;Blue Steel&quot; also offers the standard passing love interest.  While all of the actors mentioned above were part of Lone Star's stock company during that period, they managed to bring in a different leading lady each time.  This time it is Elinor Hunt as Betty Mason, who apparently thinks she is in a silent movie.  She and her father (Lafe McKee) were bringing in a load of supplies when they were ambushed.  The good guys are too late to save her father, but they bring her back to town where, of course, she catches the eye of Malgrove (a nice villainous name as such things go in these films).This is an early Wayne film and he is clearly still learning his craft, but Hayes is getting a lot closer to putting all the elements of his &quot;Gabby&quot; persona into place.  Wayne actually seems more interested in having a sidekick than the girl, telling Hayes at one point: &quot;I'm glad you decided to drift along with me. It's kind of lonesome trailing alone.&quot;  It is hard to hear this and not think of how &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes would be the personification of the western sidekick in the Hopalong Cassidy movies.  Usually the attraction to these films is the stunt work by the legendary Yakima Canutt, but he sticks to his standard bag of tricks in this one.

$review_text.: I saw this on VHS in a theater appreciation college class in 1991, and I fell in love with this version of The Taming of the Shrew.What makes this particular production so special is that it is performed in commedia dell'arte style, which happens to be the style in which it was performed in Shakespeare's day.  However, in Shakespeare's day, acting was considered a lewd and lowly profession, so don't be surprised at the lewd and lascivious nature of this production.The one inconsistency with this play is that Katherina ends her famous monologue on the duty of women with a wink and a nod, which is a modern convention.  Before the early or mid 1900s (I can't remember which), this play was not performed with a wink and a nod downplaying its most sexist themes.  This wink and nod make these sexist themes less offensive and more palatable to a modern audience, so the choice to use them was based on the era in which this play was produced, not when it was first written and performed.Aside from the wink and nod, this is probably the most authentic version of Taming of the Shrew available for mass consumption.  The Liz Taylor/Richard Burton movie is ... well ... a movie, but this version is a recorded play done in a style commensurate with when it was first written and performed.

$review_text.: What was the point of Falling Down?  If you can answer that question, you win the jackpot.  OK, so Michael Douglas's character had a meltdown and is supposedly sticking up for the rights of the consumer.  To think someone could go through L.A shooting up fast food restaurants and scaring away gang members twice your size with a bat just doesn't make any sense.  I don't care if it is Hollywood.  You still have to make logical sense.  There were way to many coincidences.  Things just did not add up at certain parts in the movie.  The acting was good, but of course, what do you expect from Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall?  I thought the background music was terrific though.  It contributed to the movie in appropriate ways, and I think it is what kept this movie from sticking to the fan.  Overall, Falling Down is a huge disappointment that has really no point to it.  2 Stars

The woefully miscast actors were not up to the task of the complex emotions that should have guided this piece.  Parker Posey always wonderful was reduced to playing a stand-in for some of the more nefarious characters in the novel the sadistic germans who assisted the lead in their dangerous sex games that ended in murder.There's little skin on display for the voyeur crowd - was anyone really dying to see Alexis naked?All-in-all infuriating and dissatifying.

$REVIEW.: I've always been a fan of Roger Moore's James Bond, but what I've discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his Bond movies were, like, actually good.  "The Spy Who Loved Me" is not one of them.  Oh, sure, it's fun -- almost ALL of the Bond flicks are fun -- but it's basically just a kid's movie, and that's not necessarily a good thing.(1)  Stromberg is a lame villain.  Yes, his underwater lair is well-designed, but it's silly.  Not as silly as that ice palace in "Die Another Day," but pretty silly.(2)  Barbara Bach is one of the very worst Bond girls.  She's not an ugly woman, to be sure, but she was a terrible actress; she sounds like she's reading -- poorly -- from a cue card in ever single scene she's in.(3)  Jaws is a stupid character.  Having metal teeth wouldn't actually make you capable of biting through metal.  The metal you were biting would resist, and you'd end up just tearing up your gums.  I don't expect realism from 007 movies, but I also expect them to not be outright idiotic.  (That said, Jaws is effectively used, and Richard Kiel was excellent in the role.)(4)  The disco score is terrible.  TERRIBLE.(5)  The plot is nothing more than a rehash of "you Only Live Twice," but on the ocean rather than in space.  Certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies!  Embarrassing.I love Bond, but this is not one of the highlights.The DVD is good, with a couple of fine documentaries, but the commentary track grates, because the director and other commentators spend WAY too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did.  Even if that were true, it'd be annoying.

$REVIEW.: Red Road (Andrea Arnold, 2006)On one hand, Red Road&#8212;a movie about a woman who becomes obsessed with revenge and goes undercover to deliver some vigilante justice&#8212;is a film you've seen a thousand times
On the other hand, while there isn't anything in here you haven't seen before, it's the way in which Andrea Arnold puts all the pieces together that make it feel like it is, at least in part, something you have never seen before


That is the tightrope makers of genre film walk, and Arnold&#8212;helped along in her pursuit by some very big names&#8212;walks it pretty well


The end result is not perfect by any means, but given a director working on her first feature and having a lot to measure up to, Red Road is better than it has any right to be.Plot: Jackie (Outcast's Kate Dickie) is a security guard whose entire job involves watching CCTV cameras trained on the Red Road housing estate in Glasgow

She is the quintessential character with no life outside her job, and eventually we realize why when she spies a familiar face on one of her cameras
This is someone who should not be where he is at the time he is, and Jackie soon becomes obsessed with getting revenge for a long-ago act that shattered her life.Those names I mentioned? This is the first of a series of three films (the second is Morag McKinnon's 2010 effort Donkeys) proposed by Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier (Antichrist) and featuring characters created by fellow Danes Lone Scherfig (Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself) and Anders Thomas Jensen (The Green Butchers)
In America, that's kind of the equivalent of Steven Spielberg calling you up and saying &#8220;hey, I've got this collection of characters who were created by Jon Jost and Ricardo Islas, and I want you and two of your buddies to write scripts around them.&#8221; How much pressure would you be feeling? Still, while Arnold is building tension, this movie works quite well
It is a quiet thriller, but it is a thriller nonetheless, and there is a great deal to be said for Arnold's script spending time to establish the parallel between Jackie becoming obsessed with her prey and getting less socially awkward around others


Where things fall apart is when the action begins in the third act
Obviously it would be difficult to talk about how things go down without spoiler alerts, but it felt to me like a bait-and-switch

Arnold has set us up to be expecting one kind of movie and we ended up getting another
That is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is likely to put some viewers off
With me, the jury is still out

I liked it, albeit cautiously, and I would recommend you take a look

Go into it without expectations and you may find yourself pleasantly surprised

$review_text.: I have owned this series on VHS, DVD, and now blu ray. If you love the Twilight Zone, then blu ray is by far the best way to watch! Yes the series is in B/W, but the image has been cleaned up and looks better than it ever has. The audio too is better. There are two available tracks, a cleaned up version and the original. Both are PCM uncompressed mono tracks and the cleaned up version is much brighter and clearer by far. But if you enjoy original tape hiss etc., then the old track works too. There is a lot of new bonus features too....just on season one there is 19 new audio commentaries, and the original DVD commentaries are here too!The price for the 5 season set is ridiculously set high as all 5 seasons bought individually total nearly $151.00 less! You can even do better if you buy used seasons.But however you buy them, you won't be disappointed with the quality of the blu ray editions of the Twilight Zone.

 It's much easier to watch than Glen Beck

 One reason it did poorly at the box office was due to its limited release


 Our loss.The Presidential Address-cum-World Wrestling Meet is memorable (yes, machine guns can quiet the congressional delegation) as is the hospital scene where the whole operation is run by idiots and is completely impersonal (hmmm)
 Lots of visual gags and cheap but funny shots
 Let's face it, this movie is more prescient than Kubrick's "2001".Three cheers for Mr

$review_text.: Although typed in the popular imagination as a Western director, most of John Ford's films were in other genres, with the director having a particular interest in historical subjects he rarely got the chance to turn into films. His choice of reading while shooting The Searchers was Gibbons' The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire while he spent many of his last twenty years trying to find backing for a film of Arthur Conan Doyle's saga of Medieval mercenaries The White Company. One of the reasons studios were so wary of letting him follow his instincts was Mary of Scotland, a big-budget failure from 1936 that even his greatest admirers have little good to say about and historians even less. Yet his film of Maxwell Anderson's highly romanticised take on the troubled reign and tragic end of Mary, Queen of Scots isn't that bad. True, it bears only a vaguely passing resemblance to history, it's melodramatic in the extreme and parts of the script and some of the performances are terrible (try keeping a straight face whenever Douglas Walton's camp-as-a-row-of-tents Lord Darnley appears while casting towering John Carradine as `Wee' David Riccio seems sheer perversity) and Donald Crisp sounds like the only real Scot in it, yet if it's more hokum than history, it's rather enjoyable hokum. The best of the film is its last half hour once Katherine Hepburn's Mary is in captivity and Frederic March's Bothwell is going mad in a Danish asylum: the writing improves immeasurably (especially in a confrontation between Mary and Elizabeth that plays less as a power struggle and more as one between the importance of power and love) and Ford's direction becomes quite artful, be it the fading light as Mary realises her refuge is in fact a prison cell, the trial scene with judges sitting literally on high above her or the strikingly shot execution scene as she ascends the scaffold.Sadly there are no extras whatever on the DVD, though it does boast an excellent black and white transfer.

$review_text.: Christopher Guest certainly had his mind on creating a &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; for the world of the theater when he created that humble little town of Blaine, Missourri with a heart of gold, and ordinary people in right place at the wrong time.This movie works in magic in many ways
It's filmed as a &quot;mock-umentary&quot;, and the cast becomes not only hilarious, but just plain lovable

If you think about it, this is you or I trying to make something big out of something small.There's of course the tradgedy of &quot;GUFFMAN&quot; which comes with the moral of it


In our moment of triumph, when we reach that goal, all of our talents used up to the extent we are exhausted of them, anything can happen, and often does.&quot;Guffman&quot; is a tribute to that spirit, the characters that are tragically flawed by it, and the total comedic stylings of Christopher Guest


A brilliant movie that will refuse to let go of your funny bone!

$REVIEW.: While it may never win any awards, CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON does often win fans.  At once overly written, then totally barren at other points, shoddy effects, bad science and coupled with second rate acting and very linear direction (everyone seems to move from right to left in this film), this is a film most would find hard to love.  But it's not without its charms... despite its television running time of 64 mins, and the fact that it was originally released in 3D (presented in 2D on this DVD), CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON has a lot of connections with other B films of the era.  The rockets used here will appear again in PROJECT MOONBASE, even the cockpit of the space craft will be redressed and reused for P.B.  The SPIDER that appears in this film was one of the most often used B picture props from the 50's - it would also appear in MESA OF LOST WOMEN and MISSLE TO THE MOON - which was a remake (yes, beleive it or not - a remake!) of CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON.  The space suits and helmets would make their way into ABBOTT &amp; COSTELLO GO TO VENUS - in the end C.W.O.T.M. is rare film and very fun in its own way. The casual viewer may be put off by it, but for collectors of this kind film this is must for any library.

$review_text.: "Treasure of Matecumbe" is a Walt Disney Production made in 1976.This is a good adventure movie but it should be kept in mind that thecritics have mostly agreed that "Treasure of Matecumbe" is not highlyrated in many aspects of production.However, I am not a professional movie critic.  I watch movies to beentertained and not to pick out all the technical faults.That having been said, this movie did not disappoint me.  It waslight hearted and enjoyable with a liberal sprinkling of adventure,action, humour and drama, with attention to detail for the time andplace in which the movie is set.I enjoyed the roles played by the entire cast namely:Robert Foxworth as JimJoan Hackett as LauriettePeter Ustinov as Dr SnodgrassVic Morrow as SpanglerJohnny Doran as DavieBilly Atmore as Thad.The story concerns two young boys, Davie and Thad, who are searchingfor buried treasure along the Florida coastline during the mid 19thcentury.Along the way, the boys pick up three adult helpers - Lauriette,Dr Snodgrass and Jim who also become involved in all the excitement.The boys and their helpers are pursued by the evil Spangler and hisgroup of men who will do anything to get their hands on the treasure.Not a movie classic by most standards but I did find it veryentertaining.The print has been digitally mastered.

$REVIEW.: These episodes highlight Gods' love for us, our love for Him, and how we should love one another in a Godly way. While not a replacement for a Church Service-they can help teach to youngsters as well as non-believers what true Christianity is all about. Sometimes learning "by example" works best in a fictional story setting like these. Whether alone or with close family or friends you can allow your emotions to have free reign while viewing and not keep the worlds view of "manly" control of yourself.

$review_text.: The night before XXXIX I watched this and just hoped that Patriots would repeat


 There are three segments of this DVD that really showcase Brady
 The first is an early season game when he is in the pocket making his reads
 In slow motion you see his head move from left to right 1, 2, 3, and then he zips the ball to his receiver
 The second shows his pocket presence

 As the pocket colapses he deftly pushes off his lineman, directs his his recever and passes for a competion
 The last is the coin toss of an overtime game
 The Ref tosses the coin and then there is some disagreement about what the opposing team called


 Brady says to the ref, "look at him, he knows he's lying."  It's just funny.The Patriots have always been a team I root for


 I guess as a Minnesota resident, the only time I would not want them to win is if they were playing the Vikequeens.

$REVIEW.: If your goal this Saturday is to see deep philosophical issues pondered for 3 hours on screen, skip this film.  If you want to have some fun and a lot of laughs, see Legally Blonde!  Reese Witherspoon is once again on the mark as a deceptively bright and motivated college student who doesn't know what she's not supposed to be able to do and then goes ahead and achieves even more.  All the while, she maintains her integrity and learns to stay true to herself - something we could all strive for.It's not without its flaws however.  Most of the other characters seem stilted and appear to be reciting lines from a poorly written high school play.  I'm not sure why the writers and directors gave only the main character any depth or appearance of acting ability.That aside, the story is cute ( and that's really the best word for it!) and I'm glad I chose it over Jurassic Park 3 last night!

$REVIEW.: There is not much new light that The Last King of Scotland brings to the tragedy of Uganda under Idi Amin


 This is not history, but fiction
 Young white Scot becomes closest adviser to a brutal dictator?  That's preposterous enough, but ladling on Dr


Nicholas Garrigan's naivete and philandering with one of Amin's wives brings Last King down near the absurdist level


 The Africa portrayed, and very richly so with close-ups and other careful cinematography, is new only to Garrigan and those who have never had contact with the continent

 To those who have, it hits all the cliches and not much more
 Still, Last King has two big pluses


 First, the story -- absurd as it is -- is absorbing throughout and, second, I now understand why Forest Whitaker won the Oscar last year
 He nails Amin, his appeal, his brutality, and his buffoonery.Be warned -- some of King is very rough going

 Two scenes in particular -- a dead mutilated body and torture involving grappling hooks  -- are among the most disturbing I've seen in a film.Bottom line -- Whitaker captures Amin, but Last King does not do justice to Africa.

$REVIEW.: Thus my four-star rating

Otherwise, this excellent video collection contains TEN classic episodes of I LOVE LUCY
While some fans may find some of their favourite episodes excluded (for example, I have SALES RESISTANCE, LUCY TELLS THE TRUTH, THE SAXOPHONE & NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH FRIENDS high on my list), this nevertheless should please the multitude of fans who cherish I LOVE LUCY


The public voted VITAMEATAVEGAMIN (i.e
officially entitled LUCY DOES A TV COMMERCIAL) as their very favourite


Although it wasn't Lucille Ball's favourite episode - per se - that was with Dean Martin in THE LUCY SHOW, surprisingly enough - Lucy later admitted she thought that the Vitameatavegamin routine was the best thing she ever did


The contents of the bottle was apple pectin (!)
The biggest laugh EVER recorded on the show was during the scene when Lucy smashed 2 dozen eggs while dancing the Tango with Ricky


The audience laughed for a straight 65 seconds


Obviously, about 3/4 had to be edited out

JOB SWITCHING, I would think, would be considered the second most loved of all episodes, it was certainly the one I most associated with the show as being THE classic episode


The Grape Vat, i.e
LUCY'S ITALIAN MOVIE, would probably come in third
It's fairly common knowledge that more people watched the birth of Little Ricky than watched Eisenhower being "sworn in" as President in 1953
The mirror sequence in the Harpo Marx episode is brilliant and who can forget Ms Ricardo wreaking havoc in the Brown Derby when her "dreamy" movie star idol - Bill Holden - is sitting in the neighbouring booth? THE BALLET contained a lot of ad-libbing in that Lucy actually got her leg stuck around the barre in real life: if you look closely, you can see bruises on her legs! When the gang passes thru Albuquerque, Ethel's ego goes to the ozone layer

Unfortunately, it's a bit hard to swallow that the actor playing Ethel's dad (Irving Bacon) is obviously younger than Freddie Mertz, but who really cares?)
Lucy is beautiful as she upstages Ethel Mae on stage

I have a small gripe about some of the footage being cut out of many of the episodes: it isn't much, but REAL Lucy afficionados will notice them
It would be wonderful if the "video people" would show every episode COMPLETELY un-cut, in their original length
From what I hear, the new DVD collections are beautifully clear and pristine prints from the first season.....AND, they are shown in their entirety.

$review_text.: Unforgiven is a modern classic and the best western in the last 30 years and perhaps one of the top five ever made

It ranks with Shane, Ford's calvary triology, Red River and The Searchers as a classic of the genre

All of Eastwood's experience in the genre, of which he is the last great star and this generation's John Wayen, comes to fruition in this beautiful realized film


It is classic in the manner of a Greek tragedy, of a man whose past has unleashed furies that cannot be ignored.If there was a higher rating than five stars, I would give it to Unforgiven

Do not miss this film.

$REVIEW.: When Synapse Films announced that they would be releasing the Hammer Films which I always eluded to as the elusive three, I had great reservations. The titles were only available on Japanese Laser Discs and were promised to be released many times over the years. Anchor Bay Entertainment released many of the 20th Century Fox titles, Warner Home video and Universal Pictures released their output, Paramount sporadically released a handful and finally Sony/Columbia released their titles.  But what about 'VAMPIRE CIRCUS', 'TWINS OF EVIL' and 'HANDS OF THE RIPPER'? 'THE VAMPIRE LOVERS' and 'COUNTESS DRACULA' were released by MGM as part of their Midnight Madness series and finally Synapse took up the gauntlet and came through with the DVD/BLU-RAY release of  Director Robert Young's 'VAMPIRE CIRCUS'-1972 last year.  It was an incredible set which destroyed my doubt about their announcement of the other titles. Now they have come through with their promise once again with Director John Hough's 'TWINS OF EVIL'- 1971, a prequel to the Mircalla Karnstein characters derived from screenwriter Tudor Gates and a film in Hammer's horror canon that was severely butchered by Universal Pictures when released in the US making it look like a costume picture peppered with the occult resembling Director Michael Reeve's 'WITCHFINDER GENERAL' aka 'THE CONQUEROR WORM'-1968 and a few fangs showing up amongst the characters.  Synapse has gone back to the original negative released by the Rank Organization in a gorgeous high definition transfer and restored the film to its erotically bloody glory. After over 40 years, the film shows why any release by Hammer was an anticipated event at that time. The film has also one of actor Peter Cushing's greatest performances as the tortured Gustav Weil who appeared in the film after the death of his beloved wife, Helen.  It is an astonishing characterization and he incinerates the screen every time he appears. There is also an appearance from past vampire femme fatale Isobel Black who erotically charged another Hammer opus, Director Don Sharp's 'KISS OF THE VAMPIRE'-1964' which also deals with a vampire cult.  The highlight of the set is an excellent documentary called 'THE FLESH AND THE FURY: X-POSING TWINS OF EVIL' clocking in at over 85 minutes and gives you the history of Author Sheridan LeFanu's character Carmilla and how Hammer adapted the character within their trilogy of films.  It explains everything about the state of eroticism and horror of that period with interviews with many top horror writers and critics and we also have interviews with Director John Hough and actor Damian Thomas who played Count Karnstein.  There is also an extra on the rescued props from Hammer sets by Mr. Wayne Kinsey from his personal collection , a deleted scene which should have been deleted, two theatrical trailers including the double feature with 'HANDS OF THE RIPPER', and a stills gallery.  Synapse promises the release of 'RIPPER' next year and also a BLU-RAY release of Director Peter Sasdy's 'COUNTESS DRACULA'-1970(will it contain a longer version?).  Every Hammer Horror fan living or undead deserve to have this in their collections.  Bravo, Synapse.

$review_text.: This movie has an interesting concept and was crafted in such a way that the tension and expectation really built up.  Added to that were several quite spine chilling scenes, and I have to admit what happened in the cabin totally caught me off guard and I loved it.  Unfortunately, the ending really drags down my overall opinion of this movie--an interesting reason but it's just not executed in a convincing manner.  I should say that this applies for both the theatrical and alternate ending.  Some people say that the latter is much better, that it ties it all together better; to a certain degree it does, but I still found it kind of hoaky.

But as with most of their offerings, "The Fallen Ones" is devoid of a comprehensible script, Robert Wagner is horrible, and every few minutes you end up asking yourself, "What's going on here? I'm confused."But that's Ok, because the film is marginally saved by Tom Bosley, I gotta tell ya, you can put Mr Cunningham in any kind of movie, doing any kind of role and I'm going to be entertained.And you have to mention Caspar Van Diehm...we are living in blessed times to have this generation's John Agar meandering his way through B-movie after B-movie, he is so bad in an "Ed Wood" kind of way, that he almost makes you believe he's a credible actor.I liked the super-sized mummy, that was good imagination, unfortunately, most of the rest of the movie was lacking.

$review_text.: "Meitantei Conan" or "Detective Konan" ("Case Closed" in the U.S.) has been one of the longest running manga and anime series in Japan

 Written and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama and featured in Weekly Shonen Sunday since 1994, the anime series which started back in 1996 is well-nearing 600-episodes and 14 movies have been released in Japan.FUNimation Entertainment have released several of the movies on DVD in Dec

2009

 "Cased Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century" is the third "Meitantei Conan" film that was in theaters in Japan back in April 1999 and was a success earning around 1.45 billion yen (over a million US)
 The film was directed by Kenji Kodama (director for the "City Hunter" films, "Case Closed" TV series, "Tales of the Abyss", etc.) and a screenplay by Kazunari Kouchi (has written the screenplay for the TV series and all films)


 Character design is by Masaaki Sudoh (who worked on "Kekko Kamen" OAV and "Momotaro Densetsu") and music by Katsuo Ono ("Lupin III vs


Detective Conan" special and the "Detective Conan" TV series and films).VIDEO & AUDIO:"Case Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century" is a film that came out back in April 1999

 So, you can tell it's an older anime but because it is a film, films tend to have a much higher budget than the TV series so you see more detail and shading in the art backgrounds

 Picture quality is slight blurry but it's satisfactory considering it's an older anime using cels and is not digital


 Also, the film does have a few dust particles that can be seen from time to time but it's not distracting at all.Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 English and Japanese Stereo
 English audio dialogue is clear from the center and music and sound effects are more front channel driven


 Voice acting is well done on the English side but for those who followed the Japanese series may get confused by the changing of the names


 Japanese audio is well-done and for those who have a modern home theater receiver and a 5.1, 7.2 or higher setup, my preference was to have audio set on all channels for a more immersive soundscape.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:"Case Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century" comes with FUNimation Entertainment trailers only

 I wished they included the original Japanese theatrical or TV trailers for the film.JUDGMENT CALL:I grew up with "Meitantei Conan" and I own several Japanese manga volumes which helped me learn Japanese and have watched the original Japanese anime series including the Japanese drama
 But I have never seen any of the animated films before, so it was a pleasure to see FUNimation Entertainment show their dedication in releasing the films in the US.As for "Case Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century", Kaito Kid (phantom thief) fans will definitely enjoy his presence in this film
 In fact, there's a pretty interesting twist revealed at the end which I won't get into but for the most, the film was well-written


 And keeping consistent with the TV series, a film that showcases Conan investigating this latest case and the film features a lot of action, a good number of characters from the TV series appearing in this film and for the most part, a pretty solid mystery case.For those who have never watched the television series, you can still get into the film because there is a brief introduction of how Jimmy Kudo became Conan Edogawa and also explanation of his various gadgets that he uses and also the supporting characters that appear in the film.As for the TV PG rating, because Conan has the appearance of a child, "Case Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century" is not a children's animated film

 People get shot and killed or physically hurt in this detective animated film.Overall, if you enjoyed the animated or manga series or an anime fan wanting a solid mystery film, "Cased Closed: The Last Wizard of the Century" is definitely worth watching!

$review_text.: Orson Welles was a genius in filmmaking in the same way that Lord Laurence Olivier could act Shakespeare. He was inspired by Randolph Hearst's life, the publishing tycoon. The film is probably just flawless. It's not too long or too short. It has the finest cast together including the divine Agnes Moorhead, Dorothy Comingore, Joseph Cotten, Ruth Warrick, and even the master, Orson Welles. He got into a lot of trouble making this film but it's worth it even in black and white. The acting is superb and the writing and directing are equally flawless. You won't find better. IT's still the number one film of all time for a reason.

$review_text.: Call me a sap if you like, but I think MR. 3000 tells a beautiful story. Predictable? Maybe. Cliched? Possibly. And yet, it's so well-written and directed, so vividly acted, and so attentive to characters rather than to attending to carrying out a sports-movie formula, that I never FELT that the movie was musty or cliched. The whole thing feels fresh. It's also funny and, in the end, rather touching.MR. 3000 is basically about a selfish man's comeuppance. After getting his 3000th hit, Stan Ross (Bernie Mac) decides to rest on his laurels and retire from baseball---even as his team, the Milwaukee Brewers, is in the midst of playoff contention. Nine years later, Ross finds out that he didn't have his 3000 hits after all; a counting error caused a few hits to count more than once, and he really had only 2997 when he retired. His pride having taken a beating, he decides to return to baseball to get his final three hits...and, in the process, grows up a little from the selfish man he was in the past.It's a plot that doesn't sound all that fresh on paper. But there's no anticipating the depth that the screenwriters, director Charles Stone III, and Bernie Mac bring to the character of Stan Ross. Ross could have been made into a caricature of arrogance, a painfully funny stick figure of a character off of whom easy satirical points could have been scored. But the Ross of MR. 3000 is disarmingly likable in spite of his (hilarious) flaws, because you realize that, despite his me-first nature, he really does love the game of baseball, and understands how it works. It is with this understanding that he becomes a mentor of sorts to the new Brewers team he joins: a group of self-satisfied, self-absorbed players who seem to care little about the game itself (and their indifference is reflected in their cellar-dwelling status in their league). In one scene, Ross sees a faintly disturbing reflection of his old self in T-Rex (Brian J. White), and, as T-Rex is about to get into his car, Ross stops him and advises him on the virtues of becoming a forceful team leader, one who can encourage the highest level of play from the team. Ross has clearly seen enough to know what makes for a winning team, and that is what makes Ross an admirable character regardless of his inflated ego.But, of course, at that point of the movie, you might be thinking that he's being a little hypocritical, telling a teammate to act like a team leader when he himself hasn't shown a great deal of similar unselfish attributes. It is precisely that kind of character complexity and nuance that makes MR. 3000 stand out from the usual standard sports-movie ilk, with its comic caricatures and by-the-numbers plots. The film doesn't take a mechanical approach to Stan Ross' change of heart. When Hit No. 3000 looms on the horizon for him, Ross decides to call for an extra team practice...only to blow it off himself in order to appear on Jay Leno. He still can't resist the lure of his own ego, even as he selflessly inspires his team to try to at least go down fighting.Stan Ross is a character that has been sensitively written by its three credited writers (Eric Champnella, Keith Mitchell, and Howard Michael Gould), but of course it's up to the actor to bring a character to life, and Bernie Mac comes through with a performance that is better than anyone had a right to expect from a man whose first leading role this is. Whereas another actor might have gone for psychological depth in portraying Ross' selfishness, Mac makes it light and funny. But Mac does achieve some real moments of emotional gravitas, moments in which one can sense, looking at Mac's expressive face at certain moments, that Ross' anxiety and fear about losing his hard-fought legacy loom in his head. It's a charming, beautifully-shaded, marvelous performance, and for all the hype Jamie Foxx garnered for his Ray Charles interpretation in RAY, Bernie Mac's may actually be superior in its emotional impact. Seriously.Director Charles Stone III keeps everything light, fresh and above all honest; this movie, which could easily have given into Hollywood-style bathos, never becomes overly sentimental with its change-of-heart story. Instead, it is emotionally convincing every step of the way. Stone---as well as the script, of course---also shows an awareness of the realities of the game of baseball today: how pro athletes can sometimes be less than serious about the game they're playing, how baseball owners can sometimes be concerned only about drawing in crowds, how sensitive media members can be when a player treats them less than respectfully, etc. You can see how a focused player like Stan Ross could be considered a refreshing and even uplifting presence in the midst of such cynicism. Thankfully, the movie itself never becomes merely cynical: even as it takes some sharp jabs at baseball as it is run today, there is always that faint recognition of truth that makes for an enriching movie.By the end of MR. 3000, the movie inevitably comes down to a last-ditch effort in the bottom of the 9th inning in a tie game. And eventually Stan Ross gets redemption---but not the kind of redemption he necessarily expects. It's perhaps not as surprising an ending as the filmmakers clearly want it to be; still, it is a beautifully fitting ending, one that puts a capper on a surprisingly better-than-average sports movie. Call me sentimental, but I found MR. 3000 touching. Recommended.

However, he does over act, though.  The movie is good to watch with a surround sound. With that note, the movie is strong enough to give it my lowest recommendation.

$review_text.: Royal Rumble 1998 was a pretty good event. Most of the matches were very good and watchable. The WWE Title Match was the highlight of the night. A good overall Royal Rumble.1. Vader vs. Goldust with LunaThis was a good match. It was much better than what I expected it to be. I really enjoyed Vaders work, especially as for a big man. He is one the greatest big man wrestler ever (much better than mark henry, khali, big daddy v, etc). A pretty good match. Good opener. 3.5/52. Six Man Mini Match with Sunny as the Special ReferreeBattalion, El Torito, & Tarantula vs. Nova, Mosaic, & Max MiniNo disrespect to any of the mini matches or any of the mini wrestlers but this was just a funny match to watch. The match was pretty great as well though. It was very fast paced with a lot of arm drags and head lock takedowns. Some good high risk and funny spots. A very good mini match. Listen for the Kings stupid a55 short jokes all throughout the match. Some of them were pretty funny. 4/53. Intercontinental ChampionshipThe Rock vs. Ken ShamrockPretty good match up. Some brawling and wrestling from both men. Shamrock gets the victory but then the ref reverses the decision after he finds brass knucks in the tights of Shamrock after the Rock brought them into the match by hitting Shamrock with them. Decent match. 3.5/54. WWE Tag Team ChampionshipThe New Age Outlaws vs. The Legion of DoomThis match had potential to be a very good tag team match and it was until Hawk got hand cuff to the ring post and then Outlaws got dqed after hitting Animal with a steel chair. Before then it was a good match. Some good slams and some intense brawling before the hand cuffing. 3/55. The Royal Rumble MatchWe all know who was going to win if yall was watching Raw the previous weeks building up to the Rumble. But it turned out to be a good Rumble to watch.It starts out with some "hardcore" wrestling between Cactus Jack and Terry Funk until the Rock got into it and then the ring would start to fill up. It got personal between Owen Hart & Jeff Jarrett when Jarrett took out Hart before he entered the ring. Triple H & Chyna would come out & screw Hart which would lead to their match at Wrestlemania. Some good outside action with the Rock and Stone Cold. Predictable ending but we all knew who was going to win it. Good Rumble. 5/56. Casket Match for the WWE ChampionshipShawn Michaels vs. The UndertakerClassic match. This is also where Shawn really injured his back on the edge of the casket. Shawn managed to fight through the pain and he & Undertaker gave an awesome performance. Undertaker gets piledrved onto the ring step by Michaels. Just like the 1994 Rumble, 6 or 7 guys comes out to the ring & trys to beat down the Undertaker until Kane comes out and who then would eventually turn on Undertaker and give Michaels the victory. Kane would then set the casket on fire to set up their match at Wrestlemania. A classic bout. 5/5This was a pretty good Royal Rumble ppv. Not a bad match on the card. It was a good event. The casket match was a classic but if I was yall I would also check out their Hell in a Cell Match, that was nothing compared to the Casket Match, it was so much more physical and violent.

$review_text.: I didn't quite know what to expect before viewing American Beauty. Having seen a trailer for the film, I expected it to concentrate heavily on the character of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). I suppose it does - Spacey, one of cinema's great actors, dominates the film. The relationships between the other main characters both add and detract from the success of the film. Particularly strong performances from Burnham's neighbours (British spelling!) - the ultimate disfunctional family headed by Colonel Frank Fitts US Marine Corps (as Chris Cooper regularly introduces himself), father to drug dealing son Ricky (Wes Bentley) and husband of sorts to depressed Barbara (Allison Janney). The Colonel despises gays, owns an original piece of Nazi cutlery and takes every opportunity to express his dominance. His son secretely videos the Burnham family home, especially Lester Burnham's teenage daughter Jane (Thora Burch). The pair eventually meet and gradually fall in love. I use the word gradually deliberately. Their relationship is one of the film's weaker points. Their subplot is ponderous and could have been dropped altogether without harming the film.  Meanwhile, Spacey's character transforms himself from a subserviant, meek door mouse, dominated by his extravert wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), into a carefree devil-may-care guy who quits his job, sells his sensible family car to buy a cool classic, the car of his dreams. The catalyst of this transformation is his daughter's friend Angela Hayes (Mena Survari), who he meets and immedialtely lusts over. When she returns his affection, Lester begins working out, turning his garage into a private gym, until he realises that they can never consumate their relationship.  American Beauty is a fun ride, mainly thanks to the charismatic Spacey. Lester Burnham does what many people would love to do - trade security for freedom before it's too late. It's not a perfect film and was perhaps fortunate to win so many Oscars, but it's well worth watching and includes another great Kevin Spacey performance.

$review_text.: As a fan of action film star Jason Statham( Transporter series etc) I had seen most of the movies in which he starred in, but I had never heard of the movie Blitz

 After purchasing and viewing this DVD I realized why I had not seen this movie advertised at any major U.S

movie theater.This is a British made police drama and even though Jason Statham was the star in the film, there was very little action showing his incredible physical skills and fighting ability
 Further, the only real shooting of a gun was done by the cop-killer

 In fact, the political correctness and dislike of guns by the Brits was easy to spot in this DVD


 As most people know, most British police officers do not carry guns and even our hero SGT
Brant(Jason Statham) did not carry or use a gun until the end of the movie when he took it away from the cop-killer with the use of a tire iron
 At the start of the movie I thought it was going to be an action packed film with Brant using a hockey stick to beat up three car thieves and than being chewed out by his boss for using excessive force


 However, as it turned out, a deranged psychopath began killing police officers who he had contact with in the past


The remainder of the story showed Brant and other British officers investigating the cop killings and finally getting him at the end of the movie.In conclusion,  if you like police dramas you might like this film, but if you are seeking fighting and shooting action scenes, forget it


 There is one other thing that you should be aware of, you might have trouble understanding some of the dialogue because of the British accent.

 It's about 50 minutes and it works you from head to toe


 These guys don't mess around and you will work hard (but even though you are sore the next day, you want to keep at it because you know it will give you great results).You can do a 30 minute level 1 workout or a 50 minute level 3 workout so as you get stronger, the workouts get tougher and you will avoid plateaus and boredom

 This feature will keep you moving up the strength scale and keep challenging you
 They suggest you need weights within about a 3lb to a 10lb range and if you are new to weight workouts, then you want to start light


 These guys are very motivating but yet they make it fun


 The contestants from past seasons are working out too and that is also motivating


 I really like this and can't wait to do it again.

$review_text.: Two simpleminded hillbillies head for the mountains to fix up their new vacation home, a dilapidated cabin, when they fall under attack by a group of college kids that have mistaken them for psychotic serial killers! Move over, Jason, Horror has a new mascot... Two actually, in TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL! Eli Craig's brilliant satire of the Slasher genre has all of the same sharply-written humor as SCREAM minus the pretentious overtures, turning Horror on its head by playing off of every major movie trope with hilarious results. Simple misunderstandings give off sinister appearances, as the college kids confuse Tucker and Dale's good-natured acts as attempts to kill them! When one of the girls slips on a rock, Dale heroically saves her from the lake, but the teens only see an unconscious body being dragged from the water! As they attempt to rescue her, Tucker accidentally saws into a beehive, and comes charging into the woods with a chainsaw, causing one of the kids to impale himself on a tree branch! Bits like this only cover half of the humor, because the real smarts come out in Craig's witty dialog. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk downplay their roles for maximum effect, providing plenty of laughs and keen comedic timing along the way. TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL is bloody good fun from start to finish, earning its place right beside other modern revisionist classics like BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON and LONG PIGS!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies

$REVIEW.: Compared to Martin Scorsese's brutal re-make, J. Lee Thompson's original is a subtler, vastly more chilling exercise, with Mitchum's Cady a searing portrait of evil and barely contained violence. The story examines how the law can work against the innocent when the victimizer knows just how far he can go to harrass his victims with impunity. Peck is reliably stolid as Sam, Polly Bergen excels as jittery wife Peggy, and both Martin Balsam and Telly Savalas provide assured support playing a sheriff and private detective. Edge-of-your-seat entertainment.

$review_text.: This film has it all...drama, mystery AND fun

 I first saw this film on Netflix and after one viewing knew I wanted to own it

 I find one of the main problems with foreign films they are either to esoteric or drag on and on to make some cultural, political or social statement

 Not this film

 The plot is tight and the Director interweaves humor with the drama


 You learn something about Japanese culture without being beat over the head


 You can easily identify with the characters despite language and cultural differences because this film highlights our basic commonalities

 I think is is one of the reasons I so enjoyed it
 Excellent film about how a misunderstanding can change a persons life


 Highly recommend....

$review_text.: This is an all-RAW brand PPV. It was pretty good overall, at least no majorly bad matches.1) Ric Flair Vs. Shelton Benjamin - Pretty good match. Flair uses his experience to battle Shleton's enthusiasm. Kudos to Flair as he helps Shelton look like a million buck here. ***2) Jonathan Coachman Vs. Tajiri - After a prank goes bad, Coach demands and gets Tajiri in the ring. This has DUD written all over it, but Coach is presented as an actual, serious wrestler and surprise surprise, this actually comes off OK! **3) Chris Jericho Vs. Christian/Trish Stratus - After Trish turns on Y2J at WM, Jericho vows revenge and gets both of them in a handi-cap match. These two (three actually) really know how to work well with each other. Even better than their WM match, which was pretty good. ****4) Victoria Vs. Lita - Womens Championship - Eh. Not a great match, but at least their took each other seriously (no comedy spots). *1/25) Mic Foley Vs. Randy Orton - I-C Falls count everywhere match -  Orton punked out the retired Foley for months and even got a clean pin over him at WM. But now the chips are on Mic's side in this NoDQ anything goes match. Awesome fight which includes all of Foley's previous big deathmatch gimmicks (although in a WWE watered down version). Can Orton retain his I-C belt against the Hardcore Legend? ****1/26) La Resistance Vs. Rosey/Hurricane - RAW Tag-Tam Championship - Just filler to calm (bore) the crowd between the 2 matches. Remember when Tag-Team wrestling was cool? *7) Edge Vs. Kane - Edge has returned after a year-long injury... only to immediatly injure his arm. However Edge is no pansy and proves it by STILL wrestling Kane! Seems like a RAW match, and not a great one. **8) Chris Benoit Vs. HHH Vs. Shawn Michaels - RAW World Championship - The rematch from WM. Can Benoit retain his new Championship in his hometown? Or will HHH and HBK prove it was a fluke. Not as good as their WM match, but still a great one! The inclusion of Earl Hepher with Shawn getting the sharpshooter on Benoit was pretty cool! Yup the crowd HATED shawn even more than HHH, with good reason.. ****Pretty good match. Easily recommended to rent for a wrestling fan but I don't think it's worth buying at cover price.

 I like that

 It's "OK, here's what the Bible says, here's what we know, here's what we can prove
Now go make up your mind."  They don't set out to debunk the 'religiousity' of any of it, just to present the facts based on what we know

Malden makes such a great complex villian and Brando ranks right up there with James Dean as the ultimate rebel.Several stories in one flick.The friendship of Brando and the Mexican he excapes with.The revenge story.The pyschoanalysis of Malden's character and what happens to someone who betrays, not just a one dimensional character.The Slim Pickens vs. Brando subplot.The whole Ben Johnson bank robbery aspect.The love story.Unlike other reviews I read here, I thought Brando's love interest gave an excellent performance.  I'm glad the film resisted the cliches of Malden's final shot.....killing one of the main characters at the end.
