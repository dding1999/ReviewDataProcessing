$REVIEW.: What I particularly like about this television adaptation is its representation of just how QUIET and sedate life was like in the centuries before our own clamorous age.  Surely our ancestors would be horrified by the sheer pace and the cacophony of modern life in the twenty-first century.I can vividly remember visiting my ancient grandparents, - who had my father rather late in their lives, - in their sitting room.  They were both Victorians by birth and temperament. My grandpa reading his newspaper and puffing on his pipe.  My grandma lost in her needlepoint.  The silence of their shared idyll disturbed only by the soft ticking of the clock on the mantle, shattering the quietude by chiming its reminder on the hour.  My boisterous presence interrupting their quiet contentment: the murmured conversation between them both and the cheery talk with welcome visitors.  The soft, hushed colours in the subdued lighting...  A veritable recreation of bygone times and values.  All reproduced here in this wonderful film.

$review_text.: I don't know why I watched this ridiculous "gore" spectacle from the 60's but I did. Herschel Gordon Lewis was never my idea of a horror film director anyway. But in this one I saw his tongue firmly planted in cheek. It's so funny and the acting so hammy you can't possibly be offended by it. Montag the Magnificent performs stage illusions where women from the audience are hypnotized as they're gored on stage. The trick is they seem perfectly fine afterward, seemingly unaware of what happened. Then later their guts fall out in restaurants or they end up dead---mutilated as they were on stage. A nosy "Hints For Women" type TV personality sets out to uncover the truth. The ending is WAY out there---what's illusion, what's reality and to whom?The "gore" is so ludicrous you know it's fake and the film so cheesy it's laughable. And the acting couldn't be any worse. See this if you're game---but remember, it's all an "illusion"!

$REVIEW.: This is a tight production. Knightley's performance intrigues the beast in me. She is a hot, tough, fearless, tight bodied, mean ass bounty hunter and, frankly, she plays the hell out of this role. Tony Scott's direction is innovative, packed with action, realism (though the film is loosely based on Domino Harvey's life), Scott gets great performances from his actors. Mickey Rourke plays a tough, no holds barred character who kicks a lot of bad guy ass. I say this movie rocks, and rocks hard. This movie is for those viewers who enjoy non-stop, moving-forward storytelling, and a hell of a lot of violence. Two thumbs up! Way up!

$review_text.: I give this movie a 5 because not many movies compare to this one as far as repeated watchability, and originality. Normally I'm not into a movie if it's not completely realistic. This movie however, is where I draw the line. The movie's plot does seem a bit unrealistic, but who cares. It's about a guy (Caviezel) who's dad (Quaid), is a firefighter, has been dead since he was a kid.Anyway, his nephew digs up an old 2 way radio that Caviezel and his brother used to use with their dad as a kid. It sparks some old memories, and he starts to use it. The twist here is that you see the Northern Lights shining outside the night he starts using the radio. So he starts talking to a man, who turns out to be his dead father in the past. It's really intriguing because he tries to change the past, only to find out that it changes more than he could ever imagine. I sincerely believe that you can't change the past without altering other future events. The movie then takes you on an intense suspense ride.The movie is an intense thriller with tons of emotion. Caviezel and Quaid really deliver great performances in this movie, and I recommend it to anyone who is as sceptical of UNREALISTIC movies as me.

$review_text.: But the merit of de Palma is the updating, from booze market in Chicago, to drugs market in Florida, which should have sent some message to the people pretending to be 'in charge'. The sad thing is not many politicitians have yet understood (of course, I'm not talking about the ones who get their cut) that the 'Prohibition' Laws only succeeded in creating the Mafia economical power, and that anything &quot;forbidden&quot; has a very strong appeal for many who would not care very much for something they could find in Wal'Mart; and, even if they still wanted it then, freer and cheaper availability would make life a lot safer for those risking to be mugged and/or killed so they can help junkies to get cash for their dose: just ask people in Holland (where life is not more depraved than in Miami, but much safer).For those who like History, 18th Amendment started not long before Mr. W. H. Hays took office in Hollywood, but finished much sooner: there was sure no shortage of stupidity in the ruling class at the time, and the results of their malfeasences are still effective.

$review_text.: 2 of 5 stars for the suspense movie Whiteout. This is a very odd movie. After watching the movie and the behind-the-scenes materials I was left with two words: "Just Because". When I was a kid and was asked why something happened, I'd answer "Just Because". The movie opens with a flight over Antarctica by a Russian crew in 1957. They appear to have a special cargo and the flight crashes. At the end, when you learn of the cargo, just say "Just Because". In modern times, we have the arrival of a US Marshal assigned to the US base in Antarctica. Why? "Just Because". The movie morphs into a suspense movie with people who get killed by a masked person with an ice axe. Why? J.B. We learn a bit about the lady Marshal but none of it appears to help the plot. Why waste our time? J.B. We eventually tie together the Russian cargo with the murders and are left with the feeling "Who Cares". The whole movie is set against the coming winter in Antarctica which often has "Whiteout" conditions. Why set in Antarctica? Just Because. In the behind the scenes, we learn this movie was adapted from a "Graphic Novel" (comic book) which explains why the plot seems weak. Listening to those who made the movie, they wanted to combine their idea of the lady marshal and the conditions in Antarctica. Now you see why I think the whole movie is lashed-together with "Just Because".The bright spot in this movie was Kate Beckinsale and also the location filming in northern Canada. Tough conditions to make a movie. Too bad it didn't have a better payload for the viewer. So, to be clear, a well made movie with good acting and production values. The weakness was the story that hung-together with magic "Just Because" glue. As a suspense thriller, it was fair. Frankly, I would not recommend this movie.

$REVIEW.: Hollywood seems to have a curious predilection for making charming and/or tragic films centered around dogs.  "Old Yeller" and "Where the Red Fern Grows", based on popular novels, are such examples.  2000's "My Dog Skip" was one of the best of recent times, an entertaining, dramatic tale.  But "Because of Winn-Dixie", also based on a book, is a pitiful rehash and retread of familiar ground, though not without its charms.10-year-old Opal (AnnaSophia Robb) and her preacher father (Jeff Daniels) have just moved to a decrepit little Florida town called Naomi, with a small church/convenience store, a pet shop, a library, and not much else; your classic breeding ground for simple, dramatic stories.  It appears that there's some friction between father and daughter, but it is not sufficiently explained for some time.  One day, while at the local Winn-Dixie supermarket, Opal witnesses a scruffy dog running about causing havoc for employees.  She claims him as hers and names him Winn-Dixie.It is through Winn-Dixie that Opal gets to know members of her tiny community, such as Otis, the pet store clerk (played quite beautifully by musician Dave Matthews), Gloria (Cicely Tyson), the obligatory creepy old lady, and Miss Franny (Eva Marie Saint), the librarian.  There are some other people in town of course; the cranky old guy who runs the trailer park where Opal and her father live, and some random kids who have their own problems, but are on screen only very briefly.And that's about it.  I just summarized the whole movie; and that's its problem:  nothing much happens.  Oh, sure, everyone in this dinky little town is drawn closer because of a dog, but beyond that, there isn't much story.Another problem with this film is a little something called "false advertising".  Watching the trailers, one would get the impression that this is a happy, light and silly family film about a cute little girl and a charming ugly dog, but in fact it is very serious, and at times, downright depressing.  There are many lengthy dramatic speeches and deeply emotional scenes, and not a lot of silly doggy antics."Winn-Dixie" is also highly predictable; there are no surprises.  Most of the dialogue is pre-processed clich&eacute; stuff (the Spam of dialogue, if you will), and the few events that do occur are blatantly phoned ahead.Certainly, little AnnaSophia is unbelievably cute, and Winn-Dixie is quite charming, but these are pretty much the highlights of this sappy story.The good thing about this film is that at least it doesn't have a ridiculously obvious moral to it.  I was really afraid as the movie drew to a close that one of the characters, most likely Opal, would look at the camera and give some speech about being nice to other people or something.  Thank goodness it ended with dignity.

$review_text.: I am surprised at all the good reviews here, because I don't think these are very good at all

 I had never seen them before but recently saw these positive reviews, so I purchased the set-- as I am always looking forward to finding new Holmes movies.Really, these are a disappointment
 I can see being pleased with them if one is buying these to complete a Holmes collection, or if one is just curious about all the different people who played Holmes, etc.If you are hoping for good story lines and character development, however, these will not fulfill those hopes.Because each episode is only 25 minutes or so, there is no time for character development at all

 As a matter of fact, there is no time for lots of deduction and detective work, either

 As the episodes start, we are immediately introduced to the mystery at hand
 Holmes is soon brought into the picture

 Holmes has to start his detective work, but there is often a narrator's voice that explains what Holmes is doing-- to speed up the process there is no time to see
 Then, everything is somewhat neatly tied up, but not really.Take the Eiffel Tower episode, for instance


 It starts out with a dead man and a clue in the form of the note


Lestrade immediately gets Holmes to help

 Holmes goes on a treasure hunt of sorts while the voice over tells us what he's actually doing
Then they go to the Eiffel Tower to complete their clue-finding endeavor


 The bad guys are up there and the episode resorts to complete slapstick/vaudeville type music/action

 There is a race up and down the stairs and I mentioned to my husband that this was like watching Charlie Chaplin movies

 He agreed.Finally, the detectives go to a Dance Hall to watch some can can dancers and find what they are looking for
 Remember, these episodes are about 25 minutes in length, but we have time to watch an extended set of can can dancers and the French singer sing an entire song (she was great, by the way-- I don't know who she is, but I bet she had a career)! An entire song! So, five minutes or so of the entire episode was watching the dancers and singer.Then there is a dance hall riot-- another slapstick/vaudevillian scene

 Then, the mystery is wrapped up.Really poorly done and the films are not in great condition, either
The music is grating to one's ears and the film is grainy
 Additionally, since they are not remastered, some of the sound was notably poor and difficult to decipher since some accents are very thick


 A subtitle option would be beneficial, but there is not one available

 Although originally aired in the 50s, they seem more like 20s, in style and execution


 I do want to give credit where credit is due, though


The actors-- including Howard-- are definitely okay


They do what they can do with the material


 But, they aren't excellent or memorable and the shows are just so uninteresting that their performances almost fail to matter.So, if you are a Holmes collector, I guess you should buy these

If you are a Holmes fan who wants to see everything "Holmes", then rent these first, if you can


 Or, buy the 4 episode set and then you will be convinced that owning everything "Holmes" isn't really a necessity, afterall


 Because what's the use of having another Sherlock Holmes set when they are not any fun-- at all-- to watch?

$REVIEW.: "We Don't Live Here Anymore," John Curran's downbeat domestic drama, adapted from two novellas by Andres Dubus, is enough of a bummer to make anyone contemplating marriage move to Brazil - alone. Jack Linden, (Mark Ruffalo), and Hank Evans, (Peter Krause), along with their respective spouses Terry, (Laura Dern) and Edith, (Naomi Watts), are close friends who share much in common - including each other's spouses. All four are miserable, depressed, desperate and disappointed. So much for the purported secret thrills of infidelity.The two men are English professors at a local college. The wives keep house, Edith better than Terry - one is meticulous, the other a slob, and take care of their children. Hank, a writer who has his office bulletin board plastered with rejection slips, is detached, moody, seemingly amoral, with a history of philandering. He has minimal energy for his family. His wife is well aware of all this. She is in the middle of an intense affair with Jack, her best friend's husband, and may have initiated the dalliance out of revenge for hubby's lurid past. Jack, in love with Edith, shows even less affection to Terry than Hank shows to Edith. He is petulant and manipulative, like a little boy, but he loves his kids. I wanted to pop a Prozac about here. Terry is faithful to Jack, so far. She loves him and wants to make everything better. Masochistic behavior? Things will never improve, so she drinks and throws tantrums. Jack could care less. So, Terry and Hank begin a relationship of their own. Vindictive? Who knows. None of these individuals show any sign of becoming happier, even with the extra curricular activities. And I cannot find an adult in the entire movie that I like. All of them need immediate intensive therapy. The children are cute, but ones feels that if they spend 48 hours more around their parents, they too will be afflicted.I kept waiting for something to happen, besides the emoting, especially with the building dramatic, musical score. Instead, the film just sits there and stagnates. There is almost no humor to lighten things up. The excellent ensemble cast does an outstanding job with what they have been given. But they haven't much to work with, at all. A waste of talent, if you ask me. Are these self absorbed, arrogant people supposed to be sympathetic...or remotely appealing, as they contemplate the minutia of their lives? What it the point Curran is trying to make? Whatever it is, didn't "Whose Afraid Of Virginia Woolf" do a better job with marital pathos in 1966? These four need to get new lives...fast.If you are looking for an evening watching marital destruction, with discordant notes - by all means, don't miss "We Don't Live Here Anymore." Otherwise, you're better off renting something else.JANA

$review_text.: The myopic Mr. Magoo has always been a great source of amusement for me, and "Mr Magoo's Christmas Carol" is an annual favorite that fueled my holiday spirit as I was growing up.  This TV special from 1962 (it was the first-ever animated holiday special) still holds up well, I must say, by adhering to the classic story that has been made more times than I can possibly count.  Seriously, someone's got to put a stop to it!  Every TV show in existence seems to have "A Christmas Carol" themed episode and I literally cringe at the thought of one more interpretation.  That's just my Bah Humbug spirit, though, because when well done, the story's timelessness is enchanting.  This musical adaptation features the lovable Magoo in a change-of-pace role, that of selfish miser Ebenezer Scrooge.  There is much humor and much heart in this presentation.  I'm not going to recount the plot, I can't imagine anyone that isn't familiar with this classic holiday tale.I will just add a few points about the DVD/Blu-ray combination pack.  First, though, I simply must give a shout out to the late Jim Backus.  Backus, to me, is synonymous with Mr. Magoo and his distinctive vocal stylings are burned into my brain.  I'm not sure Backus ever got as much credit as he deserved.  He was a tremendous character actor, although he's mostly known for "Gilligan's Island" to a younger generation.  Perhaps it sounds strange, but I think Mr. Magoo is one of Jim Backus' most enduring legacies.  And he is really great in this 52 minute short film!Bonus Content: For a feature from 1962, I was surprised by how much content was included about the making of "Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol."Included content:Audio Commentary trackFrom Pencil to Paint: Production montageRingle Ringle: Song DemoLord's Bright Blessing: Storyboard sequenceFezziwig: Storyboard SequenceCommemorative Booklet: 16 pages about the making of the specialMovie Still signed by Jim BackusLet's be honest.  I'm not sure how kids will react to the simple charms of Mr. Magoo in a world over-saturated with entertainment geared toward the ADD market where bigger, faster, and louder are always better.  But I'm betting the whimsical songs and colorful settings and lovely message will still translate.  And Magoo is a hoot!  The movie should easily entertain the kids and the Bonus Features should appeal to your sense of nostalgia (especially if you grew up with this one).  In that way, this collection is an great blend for both adults and kids.  The set has both the DVD and the Blu-ray.  I watched the Blu-ray and thought it looked terrific and vibrant.  And just out of curiosity, I popped in the DVD as well.  It also looks fine, perfectly suitable.  Both seemed remarkably well preserved for a TV show from, quite literally, fifty years ago!  A treat for the young at heart, an easy recommendation as both a movie and a DVD/Blu-ray set.  KGHarris, 10/12.

Of course, there is a multitude of great westerns that John Wayne made, more than I ever have seen, & probably ever will, but he also made other genre films, some truly great! "Hatari!' 1962, is one of them." Hatari" is about African animal trappers that capture animals for zoos around the world. From Rhinos to Monkeys, the "Duke" & crew catch them all!"Hatari!" is truly a fascinating film, filled with real animals being captured! It is exciting, especially the first Rhino scene that starts off the movie! It is funny, John Wayne & Red Buttons giving classic performances. It is funny, cute! Three baby Elephants adopt a female photographer sent from a Switzerland zoo, to take pictures of the crew catching animals for a photo album. They follow her every where, like huge puppies with no hair, big floppy ears & a trunk, as John Wayne uses them like Bloodhounds to find her in, Arusha, his love interest in the film that tries to leave them all behind because she thinks the "Duke" does not want her to stay. A particularly funny scene is when the first baby Elephant adopts her, & they buy a herd of Goats to feed the baby Goat milk. Every time the baby trumpets, the goats go flying everywhere, trying to run away. Then there is John Wayne milking a goat, do I have to say more!"Hatari!" is a great film for those that want to see John Wayne play something else other than a cowboy. Though his role is typical "Duke," well, that's why millions loved him & still do. The movie is quite unlike any other I've seen, & the fine cast, cinematography, script, & the directing by the great Howard Hawks, make this an essential John Wayne film!

$review_text.: Peter Temple, is an Australian author I have followed for quite awhile. Now, two of his books have been turned into a series, 'Jack Irish'. I was pleasantly surprised to find how very good they are.The opening sequence starts with a bombshell as Jack an up and coming lawyer is chatting with his wife about a home furnishing. An old client comes running into the office and a startling event takes place. The beginning credits roll. Some time later, we find Jack trying to get over his misery. He has gone through a drinking and gambling phase, and has now given up law and has become a would-be carpenter, debt collector, and working for a man who bets on horses. Jack is played by Guy Pearce, and it seems he has become Jack Irish, this role is his. Handsome, reckless, recovering from trauma, he plays this character to the 'T'.Another of Jack's old clients has called and left messages and when Jack picks them up, the man is found dead. This leads Jack on a search to find the question and the answer. Some of the answers reach into high political quarters, where he is not welcomed. A journalist, played by the beautiful. Marta Dusseldrop, is on the story and together they follow every lead. One of the most interesting sidelights of this film is the bar Jack uses as a sometime office. It is filled with old fellas who love soccer and knew his dad. He is a welcome part of the group, so to speak, and this gives some insight into his background.'Jack Irish' is a terrific series, great characters with Australia as it's background. What could be better?Recommended. prisrob 10-22-13

$REVIEW.: For a while now, a friend has been urging me to consider practicing yoga.  With that in mind, I've been looking into various books and videos, and finding them generally either too physically demanding or too involved in the spiritual side of yoga practice.  I'm sorry to say that "Yoga for Beginners" is no exception, in spite of the name.  In fact it might be more properly titled "Yoga for Beginners Who are Otherwise Quite Strong and Flexible."In an approximately 50 minute workout, Elena Brower demonstrates a beautiful, flowing workout which looks like it must feel wonderful, if you can manage to follow it.  Unfortunately I have neither the strength nor the flexibility to do so.  I'm guessing that most of my friends don't either, so it does seem to me that it might be a good idea to offer hints for modifications of the poses to suit older, heavier or simply out-of-shape students.  But Brower offers very little in the way of such modifications.  I'd guess that about two-thirds of the workout is simply not do-able for me without substantial modification.At the same time, the poses themselves look quite wonderful, and if you've ever done stretching and/or deep breathing exercises, the pleasure of these poses will be almost palpable to you.  Brower's voice is calming.  She doesn't rush you through the poses, but at the same time she doesn't spend a lot of time explaining them.  Because the practice is slow and deliberate, this isn't as big a problem as it might be during an aerobics video, but as a beginner, I'd have appreciated a bit more information.Right at the beginning, Brower suggests that the deep breathing is far more important than a deep pose.  I think it would be helpful if she reiterated that during the actual workout.Over all, it's a pretty, calming video as long as you don't allow yourself to get too torqued if you can't do the moves, or you fall out of them frequently.  If you can make the necessary modifications for your own fitness level, you may well get something out of this video.  Otherwise, keep looking for a good beginning yoga workout.  There must be one out there.

$REVIEW.: If you're going to make an allegedly off-beat life-affirming comedy about oddball interesting characters with personality flaws you need to make them funny and likeable. Right away Jeff Who Lives At Home falls flat, because Jeff (a gentle pot-smoking 30-year-old loser living in his mother's basement) doesn't engage you. Five minutes in and you're already wondering where the film is going. Jeff's unsympathetic and unlikable brother works in a paint store and is having a bad time with his wife, who objects to his purchase of a Porsche. An aggressive man mistakenly calls Jeff at home looking for Kevin and in his drug-addled state Jeff becomes fixated with everyone and everything named Kevin and gets on a bus across town where he bumps into his brother and... we don't really care. The plot sucks, I'm afraid, and what takes this movie to the bottom of the ocean is bad casting and bad acting. There are plenty of awful movies which have been dragged over the finish line by good actors but this isn't one of them. I left with half an hour to go and my wife tells me the action only became more and more trite and more and more unbelievable.

$review_text.: I watched the Expanded edition only so that's what the review is based on


 Anyways it really doesn't matter because I was fired up for this movie with all the great feedback & reviews and I ended up completely let-down
 Let me explain:The plot was slow moving and many of the things that happened didn't happen for any particular reason

 In other words there was pointless scene after pointless scene


It was a disjointed film from the get go and never recovered
 The Daniel-Day Lewis character hitting on Madeline Stowe's character became so lame and cliche' that I almost vomited

 There was no point of view other than a few English leaders and Lewis' band of indian guys
It was hard to discern why things happened..
there was little or no point to most of it and instead of a gripping tale of love and war it became morbidly dorky and senseless.The battle scenes could have been cool but they were bad too

 Bad camera work, no tension, too short, etc, etc


 This film should have been labeled a soap-opera, forbidden love story instead of some type of war or history epic

 I didn't care at all about any of the characters and quite frankly a nuclear bomb right in the middle of it all would have been a good way to start over again.Watch it to form your own opinion, but I cannot see what the heck everyone rates this so highly for


 The scenery and costumes were well done but that's about it.And to think that this movie was up for best picture?  Against what?  Geeesh!Totally disappointed :(

$review_text.: Tom Vaughn who's next romantic comedy was "What Happens in Vegas" directs James McAvoy fromThe Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)&Atonement (Widescreen Edition).  As Brian Jackson, McAvoy plays the small-town lad who heads to university only to have romantic heart trouble which makes his head all mushy.  Mushy-headed, he screws up the famous quiz bowl with an ethical lapse before clearing his head, finding the right girl and answering the big questions.  Catherine Tate plays his mother Julie Jackson, intent on finding a new romance after the son leaves home.  Off at college, Brian meets Alice Harbinson played by Alice Eve.  Eve is in "Crossing Over" with Harrison Ford.  As Alice Harbinson, she's a brainy stylish woman who sets Brian Jackson's heart throbbing.  Eve invites McAvoy's character for New Year's.  Unfortunately, Brian smokes some funny stuff and makes inappropriate comments when he accidentally runs into Alice's naked parents at the fridge.  Charles Dance fromGosford Parkand Lindsay Duncan fromUnder the Tuscan Sun (Widescreen Edition)bare all briefly as Michael and Rose Harbinson.  Back to college, Brian's friend Spencer played by Dominic Cooper shows up and beds Brian's girl.  This leads Brian into a tailspin which is only turned around when he realizes that Rebecca Epstein, played by Rebecca Hall who was inThe Prestige, is the girl for him.  The DVD extras are interesting as we see interviews from the cast and director.  "Starter for 10" entertains, although hardly groundbreaking.  Enjoy!

However with the Blu-rays being cropped too and the Dragon Box sets being expensive as hell, this is your best bet having DBZ in English on DVD. I can point out a handful of times in each episode where the heads are cut off from the cropping but the picture is remastered in comparison to the old VHS releases. This set is perfect except for the cropping. Get past that and you got DBZ!

In average, I buy 10 to 20 movies a month from this site, and write reviews for some of them.  As far as I am concerned,  this movie was my best buy for the month of March.  I watched it alone on a  Saturday night, and enjoyed all the 110 minutes of it.  I think the best to  way to enjoy this movie, is to buy or rent it without reading the critics,  and not knowing anything about the movie.  I never read the book, nor heard  about it, but I was really surprised with the plot.  The acting and the  relationship between Mr. Washington and Ms. Jolie was unbelievable.  The  supporting cast was excellent.  The picture quality, the DTS sound is  awesome, and the DVD has a making of movie section.  Overall, I really  loved it, and watched it a second time with the Director's commentary.  I  would recommend it.

$review_text.: This extraordinary film, way ahead of its time, provides unforgettable viewing.  The story is unlike anything that came out of Hollywood ever and this was 1933! Barbara Stanwyck plays a missionary's fiance who is captured by a Chinese warlord, played by Swedish Nils Asther. The film explores the clash of the cultures as the western and narrow minded Stanwyck learns to understand the oriental Asther.Directed by Frank Capra, in his legacy it is unique, so different to the sentimental comedies in which he later specialised. He was trying for an Oscar as best picture but the film was too off-beat to have wide appeal and it was not a box office success. It has a dream/nightmare quality and spectacular soft focus photography. Nils Asther is inscrutable and completely convincing in spite of his occidental profile and stature. Stanwyck displays her unusual naturalism and the juxtaposition of her realistic persona to his exotic one makes their relationship unforgettable. The last few minutes of the film are incredibly powerful. You will never forget the closing shot.This was the last of 4 films which Stanwyck made with Capra at Columbia in the early thirties. This is one film which could still blow away a modern audience. It should be revived and shown publicly. It is time that this Stanwyck/Capra collaboration was celebrated in a suitable DVD set. All the films are unique and worthy of revival, although this one is probably the greatest.

$review_text.: Hal Ashby's masterpiece Harold and Maude is so many people's favourite movie, that it's mind-boggling. When the film was released in 1971 it was panned by the bulk of the reviewers and was thought of as something that would be quickly forgotten as it was not easy for the Academic journalists to pigeonhole. Both, Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon won Golden Globes for best Actress and Best Actor that year even though the press had been grossly unkind. Several American theatres even played this film repetitively for two years, day after day, just because it was that good.The screenplay for Harold and Maude was an idea that was spawned for Collin Higgin's thesis for the UCLA screenwriting MFA program and the film took off from there.The bookis also available, for those interested, but be advised the book was put together after the film and reads a bit dry, and doesn't tell an expanded story as one would think it would, but rather a slightly `different story', if you will. But don't get me wrong, the book is still very entertaining and a good read.The film is about a struggle between the value of life and a young man named Harold Chasen and the mentoring brought by his new friend Maude. Not until he meets and forms a bond with Maude does he start to understand that the world, and himself isn't on the verge of an apocalypse as he might have been led to believe by his self-indulgent and caddish mother, wonderfully imagined and portrayed by Vivian Pickles. Don't you just love that accent, and her random French phrasing?Harold obviously was meant to be portrayed as someone suffering, as we see multiple attempts at suicide, which is a large part of his verbal and physical vocabulary. He has either an absent or dead father which is a theme that is not addressed but does make the viewer wonder how much it plays upon his psyche. The real story is the grand coupe of how Maude wins him over, getting him to really embrace and appreciate life, which is incredibly touching, making this movie one of the most unforgettable films of all time. The score, woven in beautifully by Cat Stevens, heightens the importance and greatness of the film, which continually pull at the heart-strings and the mind.Some people, smirk and pull away if they've heard about this film, but haven't seen it. They always say: "Oh, that film. Not interested." I've met about a handful of these types and they're typically bothered by Harold and Maude's relationship. Yawwwnnnnn. Others say they're always bothered by the suicide aspect, let me tell you that the thought of suicide has got me through many a dark night, and I don't find it offensive or inappropriate in the slightest. All I can say is do yourself a favor and watch it from beginning to end, uninterrupted and just accept it for what it is. Just because an element of a film bothers you -- doesn't mean that the film is bad, it just means that the film stirred an uncomfortable emotion in you. That's all.It would be nice to see this film get the re-master and frame-by-frame cleaning and color correction treatment. The DVD quality looks like a really good video transfer, but a video transfer nonetheless. It's presented in 5.1 Dolby surround, which is a plus, but this film really begs a commentary, extras, stills, all of that which is common on other releases.And yes, for the record ... this is in my top three favourite all-time films. Magnificent.

$REVIEW.: This a fairly long movie (over 130 minutes) but it moved along pretty well and is one of those infrequent films where there are no villains and no nasty people. Sometimes that's refreshing.What it is, simply-put, is a biography of Broadway pioneer Jerome Kern. Robert Walker does a fine job playing him and Van Heflin plays Kern's likable friend. The two guys never argue; they just help each other out. That's also nice to see and is rare in a film. The only person who acts badly is the grownup version of Heflin's little girl, played by Lucille Bremer and she gets scolded for her selfish temper tantrums and then turns for the good in the end.Most review books and reviewers here just emphasize the singing talent in this film and the fact that so many of Kern's songs are performed by famous entertainers, but I liked the story better than the musical numbers.This is one of those 1940s Technicolor films so you know the colors and bright and impressive.The problem has been finding a good-quality DVD transfer ot this movie, but it looks like this "remastered" version has finally gotten it right. Forget all the other versions.

$REVIEW.: Refering to web page at &quot;Ask Bart and Nadia&quot; at the International Gymnast Magazine.Nadia Comaneci has personal answered to the following question:-Q: What is your opinion on the [1984 made-for-TV] movie &quot;Nadia&quot;? Also, are there any plans for another film about your life since so many things occurred after this movie was made? (Dania of New Jersey)A: The story for the &quot;Nadia&quot; movie was created from stories and background information provided by Bela and Martha Karolyi and Geza Poszar. Although, I might have explained my story a little differently, I was proud of the way the movie was made. Considering the typical &quot;Hollywood,&quot; treatment stories like mine get, the movie was pretty accurate and well done. I have been approached about doing another &quot;Nadia&quot; movie, concerning my life after my competitive days up through my &quot;happily ever after&quot; situation now. I am not sure, maybe some day I will do it. (Nadia Comaneci)Review by mailoon: I found the actress who played the 14 years old onwards Nadia was badly casted, she was the major set back for this movie, or else the story was actually real good and inspiration to many. This VHS version was out of stock for some time, many people paid for a lot of money to get the second hand auction. Now it is great to have it back in sales again. It sure has lasting effect, after 17 years of screening. Nadia Comaneci has just celebrated her 25th Anniversary of the 1st perfect ten last July 18. Isn't it an incredible moment to remember? This movie showed how it had began and after that. We have so much to learn from Nadia. Today both Nadia and Teodora Ungureanu are still great friends, it is great to see these ladies had done so much for gymnastics, are still active with the sports. Lets also hope there will be another Nadia movie to show us the after story, her way to the freedom and regain her honour to one of the Greatest Athletes of 20th century.

$REVIEW.: Spirited Away is an imaginative tale about a little girl named Chihiro who becomes trapped in the spirit world after her parents are turned into pigs for eating the spirit's food.  There, she must work in a bath house for the spirits until she can think of a way to escape.In many ways, this film is excellent.  The animation is beautiful, the setting is strange and entertaining, the story is full of twists, and the characters posess alot of depth.  What I love most about this movie is the depth of the characters- no one is one dimensionally "evil" or "good".  Every character posesses good and bad qualities to varying degrees.  Even Chihiro starts off as an unlikeably whiny girl at the beginning, but by the end, has developed courage and self-reliance.  I just love the departure from black-and-white moral categories to a more morally ambigous characters, because the real world is morally ambigous.On another note, the setting of Spirited Away is strange and colorful.  I was very entertained by the bizarre array of bath-house guests, the strange twisting layout of the bath-house itself, and the haunting and beatiful scenery viewed from the train.  Also, anyone who's seen Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro might recognize the return of the soot gremlins.  I had actually seen Spirited Away first, then My Neighbor Totoro a year later, so imagine my surprise when I recently rewatched Spirited Away and saw them.  Soot gremlins!Compared to his other films, this is one of Miyazaki's more energetic and action-packed films.  So, if you've seen some of his other films and couldn't stand the slow pacing of the story, then Spirited Away may be just the thing for you.  Well anyway, I can't recommend this movie enough!  Please watch it at least once!P.S. There's some excellent bonus features available on this dvd.  First of all, there's a nice "making-of" feature, a feature on the art of Spirited Away, and an interview with some of the voice actors.  There's also an introduction by John Lasseter (pretty pointless), alot of trailers (seriously?!), and the storyboards (who watches those?).  Overall, though, the making-of is quite lengthy and excellent.  So, enjoy!

$REVIEW.: I love horror movies but most of them suck so I rented High Tension without any expectations and was pleasantly surprised. My taste must run along a different line considering all the negative reviews here.Marie and Alex are college students going to Alex's family farm for some peace and quiet to study. The first evening there, a man shows up, murders the mother, father and child and chains Alex up to take along with him. Marie manages to avoid him and stows away in the back of the man's truck trying to find a way to free Alex. As the movie nears the end there is a big twist, which I'll admit having mixed feelings about. On the one hand it was kind of cool, but if you think about it too much, it doesn't make a lot of sense with the rest of the movie.This movie is bloody as hell with some very graphic scenes. If you like your horror more psychological this one isn't for you, but if you like your violence painted with buckets of blood, High Tension is a good one.

$review_text.: This movie gets four or five stars for entertainment, only 2 or 3 for accuracy.  I suppose its inevitable that with material like a scorned wife driving her car into and otherwise vandalizing her ex-husband's house, they wouldn't capitalize on making this movie as over the top as they could.  And contrasting the husband as a saint for good measure.If you read just a little,however,  you discover the husband was very far from the saint he was portrayed in this movie.  What he did to his wife and his children (who used to hide in the bushes to get away from him) made me almost believe Betty had some justification.  And I only read about him, I didn't live with him for all those years.As for Linda, well, I am not married, so I have no personal ax to grind, but I believe that this idea that one should be allowed to have an affair and break up a family with children and go blameless is wrong. Yet in our society, such behavior is considered blameless. Why is it acceptable in our society that women and men should have no morals in this regard?  Women who would never be caught stealing from a store, have affairs with married men with children and don't consider that a crime?  While murder is not an appropriate consequence, there ought to be some consequence because it is not a victimless crime.  At the very least society should regard them with the attitude their low character grants them.  Breaking up a family, the emotional anguish it causes the wife and children should not be an act without consequences. And yet it has none for the person who does this to a family.I agree with Dot hutelmeyer, who successfully sued her husband's mistress for breaking up her marriage.  There ought to be consequences for doing what Linda did.  And as for Dan, marriage, particularly when there are children involved, is something you should have to earn your way out of, with counseling. Not just walk in one day and say, thanks for twenty years but I've found someone who looks like you, not ravaged by twenty years of working and raising my children,  so I'm leaving you for a younger model. Essentially that's what Dan Broderick did. Shame on him and Linda both.While no one deserves murder, what happened to Betty Broderick was a crime, just one unrecognized by society.  While she reacted poorly, she was an unbalanced individual (and after years of marriage to Dan no wonder, he encouraged her to think she was crazy by denying his affair) who reacted extravagently in some desperate attempt to get justice for what she felt happened to her, when she was getting justice no where else.It's interesting in our society that so little is done to protect families from what happened to Betty and her children.  A family is more than an emotional tie, it's also something of a corporation.  Women have been given the vote. Supposedly, after many years, there are now some laws to protect women from battering. But nothing protects a women from sinking years of her life, emotionally, physically and economically into building a home, having children, and raising them in a family and then having her husband, the man she's done all this supposedly for and with, have a cheap affair and walk out one day without any real consequences for him or the mistress --  cheat her not only emotionally, but legally, morally, economically and in every other way. Dan didn't even pay for her divorce lawyer, hid assets, used the legal system against her.  She had no representation in court even to try to get some justice.  What kind of way is that to treat your wife and children?Women as just supposed to go quietly into the night,set up to fail,  broken emotionally, financially and legally. Society not only allows for this, it expects it, teaching that you get a man for being young and beautiful and to lose one for being older and no longer beautiful is the ultimate disgrace.  But Betty didn't creep away, and that's her infamy.  But part of that infamy is perhaps the recognition within society that she rebelled against an inequity that has yet to be addressed and hurts millions of women and children. It's okay by society to be a mistress, but not to rage out against the person or persons who destroyed the home you spent twenty years building.  For centuries, it was accepted that men would be enraged by someone who stole their wife.  We're allowed to defend our property. But as women, we're supposed to just move on with our lives if someone destroys our family.Did Betty have other options. Sure she did.  She was no saint either.  Millions of women take the blow Betty suffered, and many of them even recover to some extent.  Some even come back stronger.  That still doesn't make what happened to them, or to Betty, right.  As wrong as it was for her to murder, it was equally wrong that she was allowed to be driven to that extreme. Wrong for her, her children, and even wrong for Dan and Linda. Linda took what she wanted, Dan took what he wanted, and finally, Betty took what was left.  Not a pretty story, and not pretty people, whom a little character all around might have saved.

$REVIEW.: I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and wasn't expecting much from it.However, the suspense and acting were really quite good.While there is not a ton of zombie like gore in this movie, the methodical way the &#34;aliens&#34; move about and seek more victims is really kind of creepy and effectively done.  Saving a standard fire fueled car chase at the end, this is focused more on good acting and suspense than action.  Very good movie, with some interesting extras, about why people fear this type of thing.  Decent movie.

$REVIEW.: This is right out of the Sunday Comics. The dialogue is so artificial you can almost see the word balloons. If they'd gone just a little further, it would qualify as camp.Seriously: the plot is so obvious, you know who the mysterious Black Knight is long before anyone in the movie does. The mix-up between which sister loves which knight is projected like a grade school punch line. When Sir Gawain (Sterling Hayden) is in bed with a serious injury and it is announced that the winner of the tournament will win the hand of Princess Aleta (Janet Leigh), it doesn't take rocket science to figure out that it is Prince Valiant (Robert Wagner) in Gawain's armor that challenges Sir Brack (James Mason).One other element that may be OK for some, but grated on my nerves, is the religious assumptions underlying it all. The villains are Viking pagans, and the heroes are English Christians. The Viking Christians, on the other hand are also heroes. The bigotry is pretty obvious, but in 1954 it was simply taken for granted.Good movie for children, but children these days have probably never read Prince Valiant cartoons in the Sunday Comics. I was still a child myself in 1954, so I suppose we have to assume this was made for the Baby Boom generation. I never saw it then, though; stories with swords and fighting in them to this extent would have been for boys.

$review_text.: Although not as bad as it could have been, "Darkness Falls" is most certainly not as good as it could have been. As directed by Johnathan Liebesman, we are served a non-stop plethora of rapid fire editing and gloomy visuals. While the idea is generally creepy, and the Tooth Fairy is quite scary to look at, we never really get to see the ghostly apparition because of the dark settings. The problem is simple, since "Darkness Falls" is like the billionth horror movie to be released in the last 10 years, the visuals are usually their saving grace. I'm sure the visuals are there, but the darkness that falls over this film won't allow us to see them.

$review_text.: This has a few of the reference points that assure you that you're watching a Bond film: the Aston Martin, 'M', the exotic locations and the girls. But as others have said, there's no Moneypenny or Q, and not many gadgets besides a mobile phone obsession -- Sony Ericsson must have paid a fortune for the repeated product placement.But it's in the changing pace of the movie that it feels least like a Bond film: e.g. the mundane toilet killing that kicks the film off, the rather slow recovery sequence leading up to the building collapse in Venice.The worst aspect of this film is the way it tries to ape '24' -- far too much torture, and little sexual content. The theme song sung by Chris Cornell is also bitterly disappointing. (It must now be more than 10 years since a Bond song zoomed up the UK pop charts.)The best aspects of this film are the opening credits (there's even a witty Mandelbrot reference), Daniel Craig throughout, and the staccato end. The movie also a serious, realistic tone lacking in the Roger Moore and Brosnan eras; you finish watching the movie feeling that not all ends have been neatly tied up. It's more like real life.Craig deserved his Bafta nomination. I strongly suspect that the movie largely got its Bafta nomination because the year is 2 007. The movie/DVD is recommended, but not outstanding.

$REVIEW.: When "Entertainment Weekly" put out a feature naming the 25 most controversial films of all time, there were only a couple that I hadn't seen
Of course, me being me, I immediately went out and bought those titles--one of which was "Cannibal Holocaust." Now I realize that any list of this type is somewhat arbitrary, but the DVD packaging itself proclaims this to be "The Most Controversial Movie Ever Made." Indeed, the film is made in a pseudo-documentary style that caused many to believe the atrocities depicted had actually happened
The filmmakers were arrested and required to produce the cast members (who had died in the film) to disprove the film's "reality"--oh, the innocence of 1980

Subsequently, the film was banned many places internationally (or cut up)


Quite a history

Well, I've never been accused of skirting controversy--so I jumped into "Cannibal Holocaust" head first.Often cited as a huge influence on "The Blair Witch Project," "Cannibal" is shot with hand held cameras and filmed from the perspective of the fictional filmmakers


Four documentarians enter the South American jungles hoping to locate and record footage of actual flesh-eaters that still reside in the modern world


Aided by local guides, they integrate with different tribes as they go deeper into their quest
And being modern white men and women, they go with their usual bravado and superiority.Of course, the crew will meet more than they expect! An interesting aspect of the film is that the quartet of "heroes" are not presented in a particularly good light

No, they are modern "savages" who value those they encounter as less than human

Much of the film's nastiness comes from the white "protagonists" as they pillage, plunder, and assault the natives

So even as you know they are headed for disaster, there is almost a retribution factor to it when it actually happens

The performances are surprisingly good, but the characters are far from likable


Not for the squeamish, "Cannibal Holocaust" features real animal slaughters, much gore, sexual assault, brutality, and plenty of good old-fashioned eating sequences.Many people will debate whether this film qualifies as "entertainment" and I can see that there would be equal camps on either side of this issue

It is, indeed, an unpleasant experience
It will generate feelings one way or another
I can't imagine someone sitting through "Cannibal Holocaust" and being apathetic


No, there will be shock, disgust, disappointment, or relief

The power to evoke real emotion is the strength of the movie, and whether you love it or hate it--there is no denying its visceral impact and that it has stirred some reaction from you (generally a strong one)

"Cannibal" doesn't qualify as "high art," but it is a successful underground film


It has been much studied and much copied in the lexicon of horror filmmaking

For that reason alone, it deserves its notoriety

The handsome and informative 2 disc set is an added bonus

But at 3 stars, I'm telling you that this isn't for the casual viewer
I can't say that "Cannibal Holocaust" is my new favorite movie, but I understand its place in film history

$review_text.: Direct Action (2004) is a direct to video action film about big city police corruption, featuring Dolph Lundgren as Sergeant Frank Gannon (not Cannon), a member of the Direct Action Unit.  The Unit is riddled with corruption, and Gannon is scheduled to testify in court against some of his fellow officers.  The film principally follows the events during one day, as Gannon is separated from his regular partner Ed Grimes (Rothafoard Gray), and teamed with newcomer Billie Ross (Polly Shannon).The plot is rather predictable and by the numbers, where the corrupt police officers, led by Captain Stone (Conrad Dunn) first attempt to bribe Gannon to keep him from testifying.  When that fails, Gannon is marked for death, and Billie Ross is drawn into the fray, when she saves Gannon from termination.  Also in the mix, are federal agents, the CIA, the Mayor, members of an Afghani task force, and drug dealers.  With plenty of deception all around, there are a number of twists intended to keep things lively, but the plot is generally nonsensical, and dialog often atrocious.  Supposedly set somewhere in Ohio, the vehicles sport Ontario license plates.Under the direction of Sidney J. Flurie (Iron Eagle), the action is mostly confined to standard unrealistic looking gunfights, and a few stunts with vehicles.  The Afghani's factor causes decorative knives to be featured in a couple of fights.  Frank Gannon gets shot early in the film, but it doesn't seem to slow him down much, through what is a pretty eventful day.  As usual, there isn't much depth to Lundgren's character, except that Gannon occasionally chews gum, looking rather shabby, dressed in a faded jersey.  Ross gets off to a shaky start, looking good while firing an automatic weapon, but rarely hitting the target.  Polly Shannon does what she can with her role, but there really doesn't seem to be much chemistry between her and the low key Lundgren.  It's hard to buy Conrad Dunn as a cop, let alone a police captain.With a low budget look and feel, treading the familiar ground of battling against police corruption, Direct Action offers nothing that is new.  The screenplay is weak and makes little sense, and the action scenes are just passable.  Like many of Lundgren's recent efforts, this is B movie territory, but if you just want a cartoonish shoot `em up, this may fit the bill.

$REVIEW.: This is a relatively intelligent show, with some good acting, and an interesting background (made all the more so with recent news about the resurrection of Sanford (although without the support of his wife).  Any way the lead actress Alicia creates some interest as an older female lead as an associated, which compares to the often ridiculous idea in these kind of legal shows that a young hot shot lawyer in her 20s would be trying million dollar cases and murder trials - although there is some of that from supporting actors etc.  She does a good job of maintaining a screen presence not in spite of age and demeanor, but because of it.  The show still has the same ridiculous late discovery stuff that would never be permitted in a real courtroom, but the show is well acted and hearing about the trials and tribulations of a major law is interesting.  A great component is some fun firm investigators who constantly uncover, at the last minute, trial altering stuff, which again would not likely happen but after all this is TV not real life.  The investigator creates a lot of screen interest as a young, tough, sexy, ethnic (it is woven into the show) woman who doesn't share - little bit like the Lizbeth of dragon tattoo fame, but not as edgy.  Eventually I expect this will get old, but we are halfway through this second season, and waning only a little.

$REVIEW.: The concept/problem with the Collector's Edition Alias Series Box Set are both highly similar to those of the series when looked at as a whole: Full of a rare beauty and promise that ULTIMATELY would get trashed by cheapness, laziness, and incompetence.This Set SHOULD have been the crowning addition to any serious dramatist's collection -- 'cause no one does it better than Alias when it's running on all cylinders -- but the ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS disc sleeve packaging delivered all 20-something discs to my door horribly scratched on not one but on two orders.  The packaging concept was terrific and it's REALLY too bad that the people that conceived the design for the packaging obviously have yet to realize that discs need protection from scratching as much as they need it from spindle-jumping impacts.As a series, despite the legions of Season 3, Season 4, and Season 5 naysayers, the show (mostly evenly) managed to hold it's own until the very last two episodes of the series which effectively betrayed the Bristows, the fans, and the all-important Mother-Father-Daughter SpyFamily Magic which made the show so emotionally resonant, beautiful, and heartbreaking.  Only emotionally crippled men who find "depth" in Mission Impossible, Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade, and The Empire Strikes Back will be truly happy with the mechanics of the ending though the Sydney and Vaughn storyline is laid to rest well.  Beyond that, rabid fan dissatisfaction may  also be the REAL reason why none of the series heavy-hitters provided commentary for the final episodes in the Season 5 DVD's.All this shouldn't come as a surprise... J.J. Abrams is notorious for commiting mass character assassination/genocide in the twilight days of his stories which is why (after Alias) I'll never watch another show he produces.PLEASE NOTE: DUE TO CONSUMER OUTRAGE OVER THEIR DISC DAMAGING DEFECTIVE PRODUCT PACKAGING BUENA VISTA IS NOW REPLACING THE DISCS OF THIS SET FREE OF CHARGE...

But Coburn is the one you are really rooting for and he is the centerpiece of the story. Spring Byington is wonderful, also as usual, and Robert Cummings is a surprise, playing a romantic lead instead of the comic that he was known for on TV.

$REVIEW.: First of all, this movie is a feast for the eyes. I love it when directors allow insight into the characters by placing those characters in settings where you can gain awareness into what drives them and makes them who they are.And then, the characters! Prospero is as mad as a sack full of bats, but he's a genius, a philosopher, a whiz of a wizard and a tender-hearted father. Miranda is impossibly lovely, in a quirky, punky way that made me think of what might have happened if Stevie Nicks and Sid Vicious had had a child together. She's part ballerina, part street punk, part child and part woman, standing right on the brink of finding her soul mate. Honestly, this production has the only Miranda, other than the recent Tempest directed by Julie Taymor, who doesn't appear to be a one-dimensional figure from central casting. And this Caliban, although not costumed like the typical "monster" in so many stage and screen productions, is easily the creepiest, spookiest Caliban even.I can't give this production five stars because I deplore all the nudity. In artistic vision, I can admire the use of nudity, particularly with Ferdinand when he struggles, dazed and nude, out of the sea. His vulnerability and loneliness, when he huddles for warmth on a pile of hay near a fireplace with a cheerfully crackling fire, is really very moving. However. I'm an English teacher, and as much as I'd like to share Jarman's genius with my classes, we can only watch the exposition, just up to the part of Ferdinand's full frontal emergence from the waves. It's really a terrible disappointment.So! Watch it for your own enjoyment and admire Derek Jarman's genius. We lost him too soon.

The songs are terrible (except for "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" and "You Must Love Me"), so overly worded, and they do nothing to advance what little story there is.  I'm still dumbfounded as to what exactly Eva Peron did for her country.  From what I could gather from Madonna's close to home performance, was sleep her way to the top.  (I fail to understand why the people of Argentina didn't like the choice of Madonna as their favorite first lady...she seems to fit the role perfectly).  The one pleasant surprise of the movie was how wonderful Antonio Banderas was.  I never knew he could sing as good as he looks!  Give him his own musical.

$review_text.: I must admit, I am confused.  Is this film making a statement FOR OR AGAINST self-righteous killing?  The exit-titles show people discussing, pretty much, the argument of revenge.  This is a film that shows premeditated killing, which to many people amounts to "murder".For instance, in the final killing in a courtroom, the scriptlines say a mafia-type godfather is about to get off, not because he's innocent (he's guilty), but because he's a CHARISMATIC mafia father, which gives the main characters in the movie a pseudo-intelligent premise to make it's statement.Two brothers go around taking revenge at criminals, disavowing the justice system, and this movie is doing what?  Does it ask if self-righteous killing is justified without a trial and without a jury?  It never forms an opinion!Personally, I will confess for the purpose of my article, I'm against capital punishment because I don't think it helps.  So, in a way, the movie actually helps my doctrine.  Most Americans approve of the death penalty by a large margin, but most of them would liberally accept and prefer an alternative when given one that works.  It's not that the film takes sides, because it doesn't; it helps my doctrine because it just shows a lot of blind, self-righteous killing that puts a bad taste in people's mouths.  This movie didn't have much depth of thought, as people who agree with the characters don't have.  The film was passed over for theatrical release.America is the only country in the civilized world, except for Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, and Barbados, that still has the death penalty.  This movie shows people the opposite by so distastefully investing so much time into defining a reason to prove the killings as self-righteous indignation.  This movie does not coral support for or against.  Instead, the main characters take the law into their own hands, and then the movie leaves viewers to decipher the pieces.Not too smart of a movie, if you ask me.  Unless, it's trying to scare people into disagreeing with its characters, and it doesn't really do a good enough job.  Willem Dafoe is a good actor, but cannot control the way a film turns out.The finale has one of the characters rattling off a list of infringements to the ten commandments, including that killing is wrong, and then the guys execute the mafia boss!Furthermore, when I write a review that puts down something someone else likes, people tend to click the "no" button.  Obviously, people only want opinions that agree with theirs.  I'd think people open minded if, when I take the time to state my objection, others would support me!

$review_text.: Sorry to quote Jesse, but I couldn't resist. This movie has garnered much divided opinion; both camps are right. It sucks AND it's great. First of all, immediately dismiss every opinion that whines 'where's the blood?'. Simpletons who need monsters and gore to officially enjoy a horror movie should park their cars on road shoulders and read back issues of FANGORIA while waiting for the next highway fatality to rubberneck. This is essentially a ghost story, and ghost stories frighten with mood and suggestion, not with slashed carotid arteries. But most of the naysayers have a point: after the overkill of the media hype, you DO walk away deeply disappointed after the first viewing. The narrative structure, such as it is, is clumsy and tedious. But part of that disappointment is due to the fact that horror movies are marketed to yahoos, and otherwise-rational viewers have become all too willing to think and act like yahoos when watching a horror movie in a theater. And who can blame 'em, after 20 years of dumbed-down, market-researched 'rollercoaster ride' horror that feeds the mob a steady, predictable diet of CGI, 'dream' sequences, unkillable brand-name psychos, and wisecracking teenage hardbodies. To release a serious, straightfaced, artistic horror movie nowadays is to ask audiences to think unsettling thoughts and FEEL something genuine: far easier to let the latex do the talking over a heavy-metal soundtrack and hope you can con enough kids into believing a 'director's cut' DVD of ELM STREET 12 is a statement for the ages worth owning. Now, while BLAIR WITCH is far from perfect, it does have one 'monster' that no fx wizard could ever approach...those damned woods. Anyone who's ever gotten lost on a camping trip, or even driven through the woods at night, knows exactly what I'm saying here. There's something deeply, frighteningly eldritch and pre-human about wooded areas. Nature isn't Bambi and Grizzly Adams...it's harsh, unforgiving, cruel, remorseless; the territory of elder Gods who predate our warm and fuzzy civilized notions of deities and divinities. To live out in those woods and survive extracts a price so terrible that our ancestors finally fled, formed societies, created cities....ain't NOTHING scarier than the wild. As the three kids in this movie venture deeper into the woods, I felt a deep intuitive foreboding forming in the most primitive jelly of my brain. They're doomed because they've learned to be afraid of people but they've forgotten to be afraid of Nature, and deeper they go into a place where the very terrain- the rocks, the trees, the dirt beneath their feet - is the predator stalking them. All the faux-hostility they've learned from rap music and schoolyard brawls can't help them now. If you saw this flick and left the theater underwhelmed, see it again, alone, late at night. You might think twice about preserving any rainforest anywhere. The 'movie' part of BLAIR WITCH may be weak tea, but those haunted woods are scarier than any weightlifter in a hockey mask.

$review_text.: Sometimes films get reputations way out of proportion with their artistic merit simply because they expound a point of view that the public, or critics, like or agree with. Such is the case with the first feature length film from Polish film legend Andrzej Wajda. Released in 1955, the 87 minute long black and white film A Generation (Pokolenie), is not a particularly good film. No, it's not a bad film, but it visually resembles a mediocre 1940s film noir admixed with a touch of Italian Neo-Realism from its blighted and impoverished landscapes. Its characters, such as they are, are not realistic, and merely one dimensional tools for the agitprop that is at the heart of the film.Yes, one must realize that the film needed to be green lighted by Polish censors, but unlike the ways a more mature Wajda, and later filmmakers like Roman Polanski (who has a small acting role in the film) and Krzysztof Kieslowski (called the Polish School), would, A Generation plays out more like a Primer for Communism. It became part of a de facto War Trilogy of films made about Poland's World War Two Experience, and it is packaged by The Criterion Collection as part of a Three War Films collection, along with Kanal and Ashes and Diamonds (Popi&oacute;' I Diament). Hopefully the two later films provide more true cinema to be savored....The cinematography by Jerzy Lipman is solid but unspectacular, and the scoring not even up to Hollywood B film melodrama standards. Often, mediocre films like this are defended by acolytes on grounds that its visuals are `pure cinema,' or some such. Well, this one's are not, but even were the mise-en-scene great, it would not make up for the leaden acting, dull script, and agitprop galore. Given that an average feature film will have dozens to hundreds of framed shots, the laws of average, and random chance, will demand that a few will be well-composed. So? It's whether or not a far greater number than average are which matters. Or whether or not the few that are are super-poetic, or the like. Then, one might have an argument over the visual elements raising up the bar for the film. A Generation lacks that, all of that.Similarly, although it is reasonable to argue that the Marxist references in the film were intended, at the time, as a sly backhanded critique of the system, none of that matters now, as it is simply blatant agitprop. Great art rises above such strictures, and the idiocies of would be censors. Minor anachronisms- such as a racist caricature of a black man on a cuckoo clock, are not as egregious, since it is emblemic of the times and its attitudes. Overall, A Generation does show some promise, especially in the Jasio Krone character, and a few scenes of realistic interplay, such as when Dorota and Stach first have sex, because she refuses to let him leave after the Nazi curfew has come. But, these are few. Wajda may have gone on to become a great filmmaker, but that grace is not evident here. Perhaps that is another legacy of art in totalitarian states, inside or outside a celluloid frame.

$review_text.: It has moments of pure melodrama, but as a whole this soap operatic film noir is kind of delicious.  I mean, the performances (as a uniformed whole) sizzle, the set pieces and costumes dazzle and the climax hits with a giant bang (felt right in the gut).  &#8216;The Bad and the Beautiful&#8217; is neither bad nor beautiful but some marvelous amalgam of the two.The film uncovers the seedy realities of Hollywood by focusing on a self-centered and self-promoting film producer and the lives entangled in his webs of lies, manipulation and advantage.  Jonathan Shields has big dreams for himself and he&#8217;ll walk all over anyone it takes to attain them.  This includes Fred, his business partner and director who gets squeezed out of a film deal because of Shields.  It also includes Georgia, the alcoholic actress who falls in love with him only to have him take clear advantage of her emotions.  And then there is James, the author who has Jonathan&#8217;s claws dug into his flesh and the flesh of his unassuming wife, Rosemary.The film is told in thirds, each act focusing on his betrayal of one of the key characters in his life.For me, this film is kind of glorious.  Yes, there is a lot of &#8216;over&#8217; everything here, which only helps balance out the straight faced &#8216;noir&#8217; angle of it all.  It feels like the perfect blend of two totally (and tonally) different worlds, and I applaud Vincente Minnelli for making it all work so well.Kirk Douglas was born to play this role.  It fits him like a glove.  He is seductive and crushing and manipulative and sleazy and charming and just everything needed to sell every move he makes.  Lana Turner became a star thanks to this film and this performance, and rightfully so.  She makes each broad stroke feel lived in, and she makes the quiet moments feel richly developed.  I would have loved her to have received the Oscar instead of Gloria Grahame, who is fine here but does nothing of real note here.  Barry Sullivan and Dick Powell are both really good here, downplaying their emotions well enough to balance out the broader leads.  Powell is particularly effective in the latter half of the film.&#8216;The Bad and the Beautiful&#8217; is beloved by many, a true classic, and it deserves that title.  This is a real Hollywood movie; lush, bold, &#8216;bad&#8217; and &#8216;beautiful&#8217;!

$review_text.: I never watched "The Big Valley" when it originally aired, but I was just under 10 years old when it debuted in the fall of 1965, and back then, on Monday nights, when your parents said be in bed by 10 pm, you obeyed.  I began watching the show when it began its run in syndication in 1969, airing most weekday afternoons.  In my eyes, Linda Evans was simply the most beautiful female on TV back then.To see any season of "The Big Valley" finally reach DVD is an event to celebrate.  The reasons I give this release four stars instead of five is that in my humble opinion, the first season was weighed down a bit by overacting, with the cast getting more comfortable in their characters as the season went on, and the writers toning down the soap-opera angst, especially involving Heath.  In the first season, the main cast was given to rambling, almost Shakespearean speechifying, out of place in a western.  Fortunately, this defect was mostly gone by the far superior second season, where Heath is noticeably more laconic and the actors and writers are not trying so hard.Gone by the second season as well is the character of Eugene, the youngest Barkley and least interesting brother.  The actor who played him was drafted and had to leave the show, or so the story goes.  Either way, it only helped the series hit its stride.  Also, Linda Evans was even more beautiful in the second and third seasons.So if you love a great TV western, this is one of the best ever, and although I would recommend the first season to nearly anyone who loves westerns, the series only got better.

$REVIEW.: Charlie has his youngest helper ever - or at least in any of the 20 Chan films I've seen - as 12-year-old Charlie Jr. joins Number One Son Lee as they both help dad solve a crime.Lee (Keye Luke) plays a member of the United States Olympic swimming team in this adventure. The repartee between Chan (Warner Oland) and his two sons in here is terrific. Layne Tom Jr. plays Charlie Junior.The Chan movie is more of an adventure than the normal whodunit as Charlie and the cops travel to the Olympics in Munich, Germany in search of a missing radar-plane "black box." Lee is kidnapped at the games and his dad does everything he can to get his kidnapped son back while not jeopardizing the United States in the process.This is one of the better Chan films and is available on DVD  as part of the four-disc Charlie Chan Volume 2 set.

$review_text.: This movie pretends to offer 24 carats but is in fact "Fool's Gold". The story concerns 3 Council Workers by the unlikely  names of Sue, Lotto and Wookie  (!) who spend their weekends gold prospecting. They have the energy to do this because most Council workers I see are usually having a 'smoko" or leaning on a shovel. So these three "Aussie Battlers" find a HUGE nugget  and instead of converting it to cash they bury it! These three losers have aspirations too  and  drive around in a  gas gussling V8 Holden Statesman which could be why none of them have any cash although they always seem to find some money for beer down at the Pub. This is a very common trait amongst Australian men.Dissent amongst the ranks soon follows but in "True Blue, Dinki Di, She'll Be Right" Aussie Style everything turns out fine as these three losers  discover the true value of mateship (friendship).I do grow weary of Australian Filmakers  who think they have a monopoly on the concept of 'Friendship" as if nobody else in the world has any good buddies.Don't blame me. I am of German/ Hungarian Descent. I give this movie 5 stars because it does have some nice Aussie scenery in it.

$REVIEW.: There's a scene in THE WRESTLER where Mickey Rourke, the once mighty "Ram" who fought the villainous "Ayatollah" in a classic bout at Madison Square Garden twenty years previously, is walking from the "backstage area" at a big suburban supermarket to the deli counter where he now works
We've seen him take a similar walk earlier in the movie, at the end of which he parts the curtains and hears the roar of an excited crowd


 At the deli, all that awaits are customers likely to be persnickety about how much potato salad he puts into their containers

 Darren Aronofksy's movie features incredible, heartbreaking performances from Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood
The film itself offers a poignant look at the price of fame, the world of wrestling, the complexities of life, the emotional simplicity of fan adoration, and the punishment a performer is willing to put himself -- and his family -- through in a desperate attempt to make the cheering last forever.

$review_text.: Overlong but fairly engrossing bio of Gladys Aylward, an English-woman who, despite her lack of qualifications, becomes a missionary in China. The film is episodic and covers Aylward's brief career as a parlor maid (saving money for her trip to China), her journey to China, her work at the Inn of the Sixth Happiness and the Chinese-Japanese war which results in her guiding 100+ children in an arduous journey through the mountains to a safer village. I didn't find the film as moving as other reviewers but it is well mounted and nice to look at. Bergman is outstanding as are other supporting players, most notably Curt Jergens and Robert Donat. This was Donat's last film (he died before it was released) and his last screen words are prophetic - &quot;We shall not see each other again, I think. Farewell.&quot;What is most notable about this dvd release is the excellent commentary by Nick Redman, Aubrey Solomon and Donald Spoto. Redman talks about the real Gladys Aylward, Solomon talks about the film production and Spoto discusses Ingrid Bergman. There were many things changed for the film version and many of them are small and inexplicable. For example, Aylward's given Chinese name was Ai-weh-deh (not Jenai), an adopted child was actually named Ninepence (Sixpense in the movie), etc. Other changes were more larger in scope - Aylward's journey to China was quite harsh and she almost died several times. The inn-keeper, Jeanne Lawson (memorably played by Athene Seyler) was no as agreeable a woman as portrayed in the film - she was actually a cantankerous person prone to fits and thought to be quite mad by the villagers. Aylward herself was thought by many to be fanatical and to put it bluntly, off her rocker. Many other fascinating aspects about the film and the women (both Aylward and Bergman) are included.

$REVIEW.: If you've ever seen a ghost story before, you won't know whether to be bored or disappointed. The only winner here his the score, and that manages to lose because it seems built for a very different film. In a more traditional ghost/horror story, it would have been perfect.It is all downhill from there. At least half the film is spent with characters standing around, attempting to build mood but in practice only seeming pretentious. The acting is a poor effort from all involved, most notably the incredibly out of his depth Shane West. The few times the plot ventures into something happening, it is either completely predictable of insanely illogical(biggest problem- Sorvino's reason for going to the cabin in light of revelations about her past).In all, the most interesting way to spend ones time with this is to count missed opportunities- points that might have actually built the story up and are instead ignored.

$REVIEW.: As the Barret family's peaceful suburban life is rocked by an escalating series of disturbing events, they come to learn that a terrifying and deadly force is after them. I had a pretty good notion of what this film was about and I had really thought maybe this was going to deliver something new that I hadn't seen before. The story was interesting enough for a decent viewing experience & it did have some good frightening scenes spread thinly throughout. Overall it was mainly a psychological thriller and was hardly a horror film, so if you're thinking you're going to be in for any kind of brilliant sci-fi visual experience you won't get much more than very thin "shades" of the most commonly used interpretations of what an alien being looks like. Also don't expect any visual horror scenes because there is little more than a bit of head banging. With a budget of $3.5 million the film relied heavily on story & acting, but laid off on the CGI. Overall it's cast did a fine job & it's production value was as good as any other Hollywood film. While I believe it will hold peoples attention, I doubt many people will be walking out of the theater saying wow or OMG brilliant! The plot was very similar to many other alien abduction films, which made it somewhat predictable right down to the final scene, which contained little more than a very very slight turn of events. It is a OK film.

$REVIEW.: The title says it all. The movies are great. I got this because I really wanted the first three movies on blu-ray.  And it was a great deal. The quality of the picture is pretty good.  The only complaint I have about this set is the box itself.  It has this terrible sleeve system that is a pain to get the movies out, and you have to grab the flat side of the disc to get them out, which is stupid design to say the least.  I give the movies a 5/5 and the case a 1/5.  I haven't watched the bonus features yet so I can't talk about those.  I would say only consider buying this if you can get it for a good deal. I'm considering pulling all the movies out and putting them in a different case.
$SUMMARY.: Great movies decent blu-ray terrible box

$review_text.: James Caan plays a hardcore master thief who's spent almost his entire adult life behind bars.  When he makes a Faustian bargain with a mobster (Robert Prosky) in order to get out of the life, everything he's worked for  tumbles down around him. This is a MAGNIFICENT movie, full of power, irony,  and ferocious action!  I think it's Caan's greatest role, and that's saying  A LOT!  He brings incredible intensity to his role as a man  who, in order  to save himself, must destroy everything he loves. Not only is this a  fabulous movie, it's my favorite DVD.  The DVD/widescreen format truly does  justice to Director Mann (MIAMI VICE, MANHUNTER, HEAT)'s  quirky,  ultra-slick style.  Also, the commentary by Mann and Caan is EXACTLY what a  DVD commentary track should be:  two great artists commenting on the film  at the same time, playing off of each other and really adding a whole new  dimension to the film (for instance, did you know that the &quot;technical  advisors&quot; for the film were a &quot;crew&quot; of jewltheives, and  that Caan was breaking into REAL safes with REAL burglary tools?). If you  loved HEAT, you HAVE TO see this movie!  In fact, this is almost a  companion piece to HEAT, because  Caan's character is sort of an earlier  version of DeNiro's character. If you are a fan of films like RESERVOIR  DOGS, HEAT, PULP FICTION, and THE GETAWAY, this is a MUST-SEE!  This is  truly a modern classic!
$SUMMARY.: A must-see movie, and an AWESOME DVD!

$REVIEW.: Thirty years have not tarnished the unequivocal hilarity of Mel Brooks' send-up of classic 1930's horror movies. With stiff competition from "The Producers" and "Blazing Saddles", classics in their own right, this is arguably Mel Brooks' comedy high watermark. This masterwork is just one of those serendipitous circumstances when all the elements work beautifully and in just the right amounts. First, there are the visual elements...the sharp black-and-white cinematography by Gerald Hirschfeld and the authentic-looking production design and set decoration by Dale Hennesy and Bob De Vestal. Then there is the endlessly clever script by Brooks and star Gene Wilder, which ranges from broad slapstick and farce to bawdy burlesque humor to sharp irreverent satire. They have written a king's ransom in funny lines that have since become part of comedy film lore..."Werewolf?...There wolf. There castle."..."He vas my...boyfriend!"..."It's Eye-gor"...""Put...the candle...back".The casting is impeccable. As Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced "Fronk-en-steen" to escape his "cuckoo" bloodline), Wilder balances his trademark wide-eyed innocence with the character's monomaniacal drive with perfect aplomb. Teri Garr and cross-eyed, bug-eyed Marty Feldman lend able comic support as Inga and Igor, the doctor's nubile "laboratory assistant" ("Roll, roll, roll in da hay") and the hunchback, inexplicably British footman ("What hump?"), respectively. Kenneth Mars has a funny turn as the police inspector, looking very much like a direct cousin of his F&uuml;hrer-loving Franz Liebkind in "The Producers". Deglamorized to the point of being heroic, Cloris Leachman is wonderfully over-the-top as Frau Bl&uuml;cher, still holding a torch for the original Dr. Frankenstein and whose very name makes the horses whinny in fear. Of course, she did a variation of this role in Brooks' later "High Anxiety" as the evil Nurse Diesel. Peter Boyle, well before his paternal curmudgeon on "Everybody Loves Raymond", makes a lovably menacing monster, his fearful nature offset by a soft-shoe turn with Wilder on "Puttin' on the Ritz". An almost unrecognizable  Gene Hackman provides a memorably riotous cameo as Harold, the blind monk ready to make espresso for his new friend. Even with all this keen competition, Madeline Kahn still stands out as Elizabeth, the doctor's high-maintenance fianc&eacute;e, who in one of the most hilarious scenes, gets seduced by the monster and climaxes with a rendition of "Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life" that would make Jeanette McDonald blush. Just about everything she says gives me an uncontrollable case of the giggles. She is well missed.The DVD has several worthwhile extras such as a few deleted scenes and outtakes, including a ridiculous "Actor's Parade" sequence that has no purpose but to make the entire cast pass by the camera. There is also a 36-minute making-of documentary, which is informative, entertaining and includes even more outtakes. There are also a couple of oddly amusing Mexican TV interviews with Feldman, Wilder and Leachman. This is a true comedy classic well worth owning and watching over and over again.

$review_text.: &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot; is the film that really cemented Burt Lancaster's career in Hollywood as a major player.  Aside from the fact that Burt does all of his own stunt work - some of it so harrowing I almost had to close my eyes, this nimble, garishly colorful and thoroughly captivating spectacle really grabs the viewer in.  Burt plays a pirate, out for revenge and gold.  Stop me if you've heard this one before.  But the script moves the story along with witty dialogue and plenty of eye boggling acrobatic routines that will leave you thrilling for more.Warner Home Video has given us a nice looking DVD.  Though age related artifacts are present throughout the transfer, colors are nevertheless rich, bold and well balanced.  The film has a decidely &quot;warm&quot; look to it with flesh tones that are perhaps a bit too orangy.  But oh, how the Technicolor photography will simply take your breath away.  Edge enhancement, shimmering and minor pixelization are all present but at extremely low levels.  The audio is mono but nicely cleaned up and well balanced.EXTRAS: NOT A ONE.  I have to say that I'm not really happy with Warner's classic DVD policy of late.  While many of the Warner Titles from the library get extra features packed into them the MGM titles of late are generally getting shafted with substandard transfers and no extras (Father of the Bride and Broadway Melody of 1940 come immediately to mind).  A classic is a classic, no matter the studio that originally made it.  Do them all right or don't do them at all!BOTTOM LINE: This is the swashbuckler to get.  Aside from &quot;Scaramouche&quot;, which is bar none, the best sword play movie in this latest crop of Warner DVD's, &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot; will certainly not let you down and the transfer is pretty good besides!

$review_text.: The original Swedish-made Michael Nyqvist/Noomi Rapace version BLOWS AWAY this American-made Daniel Craig/Rooney Mara version.  Noomi Rapace is so far superior in the role of Lisbeth compared to Rooney Mara that it's a joke--NO comparison.  It seems like Rooney Mara is some 15-year-old girl playing dress-up and pretending to be Lisbeth in some high-school drama club version of this story.  Mara's supposed Swedish accent is comically bad and her acting is horrendously awful.  She's totally one-note and gives zero depth, emotion or humanity to the Lisbeth character.  Mara's performance made Lisbeth both boring and unlikable.  A terrible casting choice for the remake.  And Nyqvist owns the role of Blomkvist compared to Craig as well, again no comparison.  This American remake is far more plodding and boring, and less intriguing, less suspenseful and less intense than the original Swedish version.  Major, major let down.  Expected a far better remake from the usually outstanding director David Fincher, but Fincher seems to have sleptwalked through the directing of this one.  You can tell his heart just was not in this remake at all.  And the cinematography and editing are subpar as well.  Case in point, there are virtually NO meaningful close-ups of the Lisbeth character (Mara) that last more than a second, the DP and editor keep her at a distance from the viewer so no bond is ever formed between the Lisbeth character and the viewer.  But then again, Mara's acting is so bad and she's so wrong for the role, maybe it's a moot point.  Can't even recommend this poorly done remake as a rental.  Suggest watching the original Swedish version only... As far as the poor packaging, I must echo about a dozen other 1-star reviewers here who pointed out the subpar "look" of this DVD... it DOES NOT look like a professional quality-made DVD like a trusting buyer would reasonably expect to get, no, it appears to be a blank DVD-R that has apparently been "burned" on some apparently low-end duplication machine with the title (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) actually hand-written (scribbled) on the DVD-R in black magic marker.  At first I found it confusing that this low-end "bootleg" quality looking DVD was being sold by a major studio.  I pay for professionally-produced DVDs, not bootleg-level ones.  But now, after investigating the situation online, it appears Sony/Columbia intentionally made the DVD look like a "pirated"-quality DVD for, well, who knows why...  Because Lisbeth is a hacker... ?  Bad idea.  Bottom line is the DVD looks bad and that bums me out.  I don't care why Sony/Fincher/whoever did it, I want a DVD I buy to look like a professional DVD and not pirated junk.  And on top of the bad looking DVD, the one I bought "froze" up twice while playing it.  So looks bad and plays bad.  Bottom line: 1 star for the movie and NEGATIVE stars for the look/quality of the DVD.

$review_text.: The importance of being Irish. Or: another chapter in rep(tilian) history.Martin Scorsese and Mark Wahlberg produced this charming TV series for HBO's family program (an Italian and a Swede? Hm).Its subject is gang business during prohibition. The plot is centered in Atlantic City, with Steve Buscemi as bossman. It also branches out to New York and Chicago, with various popular local heroes such as Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, and Al Capone. Not to forget, Ponzi in Boston, but he only as a footnote.It is primarily an ethnographic expedition into the meaning of being Irish. Other tribes serve as backdrop: the Italians, Jews, African American gangsters of the time.What do you call a sober Irishman? A corpse.Buscemi's Nucky Thompson loves to spice up his public speeches with such jokes. The Irish are the backbone of his boardwalk empire. His brother is sheriff. The police force are his enforcers. Even the temperance ladies invite him to make speeches. He will follow his maxim: never let the truth stand in the way of a good story.Nucky is not only in the booze business, he holds a key role in district and state politics, controlling the Republican party machinery. Among his achievements is the support for Warren Harding for the Republican nomination. We know what became of that. Nucky knows it too. He knows that he helps to put a fool into the White House, but he needs those roads built... (it seems to me, Harding wouldn't surprise us among the current reptile batch).Aside from business and politics, on the personal level, we watch with chuckling amusement how the bossman gets erotically entangled with a widowed temperance supporter, who turns out to be less saintly than we thought. Apart from that, there is the problem that it was Nucky himself who had made her a widow. She is not supposed to find out. This is all about politics and power.Towards the end of the season finale, Nucky has won the local election for his mayoral candidate and he has made peace with the gangs of New York and Chicago, but we see an inner-Irish conspiracy against Nucky take shape. We can't wait for season 2.

$review_text.: A really good film noir from Jimmy Stewart.  It has a documentary style that may come off a little stilted today but is still a fine character piece.  The film remains suspenseful until the end and has a "good" ending but not necessarily the "happy" ending.  The climactic scene has a plot hole you can drive a truck through, but who cares?  Jimmy Stewart is in great form as a cynical reporter.  There is fine support coming from Lee J. Cobb and Richard Conte.  Its a tale of guilt and innocence in gangland Chicago.

$review_text.: SESSION 9 is a terrific, atmospheric, haunting, dream-like pscyhological thriller with a unique setting:  the real-life Danvers Insane Asylum in Massachussets.  A five-man team of asbestos removers is tasked to rid the abandoned, maze-like building of asbestos in just one week.  Adding to the pressure of this seemingly-impossible job are the personal demons of each of the men working there.  Slowly, the evil influence of the Asylum, as well as the aforementioned personal issues of the men lead to a horrific turn of events.  Will any of the men live to tell about their week at the asylum?  Is there something sinister there, or is one or more of them insane? Therein lies the hook of the movie.Let me just say this right now.  If you're a fan of "cutesy" horror, then Session 9 is not for you.  When I say "cutesy" horror, I mean horror that involves 1)self-aware teenagers or young adults spouting dialogue that sounds like it was penned by Kevin Williamson, 2) a slasher wearing a ghostmask/parka/rain slicker/fisherman's hood/fencing mask/cherub mask/whatever, and 3) at least one or two faces on hiatus from the WB Network.  In other words, everything that followed SCREAM (SCREAM's success was really a double-edged sword: on one hand it revived the horror genre.  On the other hand, we will probably have to suffer putrid, self-aware SCREAM rip-offs until the end of the world.  I don't know whether we should celebrate Kevin Williamson, or slap him silly)SESSION 9 is, at the risk of sounding like a snob, a thinking-person's horror movie.  Many things are open to interpretation.  The pieces form different puzzles at different times.  At the best of times, all you have are suspicions and fears, nothing known for sure.  If you like SCREAM and it's progeny, this movie will frustrate the living heck out of you.  But if you like films like THE SHINING and DON'T LOOK NOW, where the pace is deliberately slow to lull you into a sense of unease and dread, where seemingly benign environments gradually morph into treacherous and terrifying wastelands, where even after the film has ended, you are looking over your shoulder because, without realizing it, the film has gotten under your skin, if you like all these things in a movie, then SESSION 9 is for you.My hat is off to Brad Anderson and Steve Gevedon (the writers of SESSION 9--ANderson also directed, while Gevedon also acts).  In a perfect world, their SESSION 9 would have been the one to revive the horror genre, and not Kevin Williamson's SCREAM.  But as we all know...

$review_text.: I forgot just how bad/great this movie is. In fact, I forgot how true this is to all Douglas Sirk's movies, but this my favorite. I remember seeing this on NBC's Saturday Nights at the Movies when I was a kid. Where to begin. The acting is wooden (although Hudson is always wooden, no pun intended) the sound stage scenes are so lavish and over the top and the music, OMG, the music. Between the defining sounds of violins and a chorus sounding like angles as the sky opens it is enough to make you want to cry (from laughter).Yet, it was the beginning of a string of very highly successful, Technicolor extravaganza's that the public wanted. Soap opera at ITS BEST! The story is so ludicrous (as all of Sirk's stories were) that I will not even address because so many have. It truly defies logic in any sense of the word....again, a HUGE trademark for movies back in the 50s.The cinematography is breathtaking, the use of Technicolor to paint a deep, deep pallet is mesmerizing and the sheer joy of being transported into another place and time in order to forget your own problems of the day is what makes movies, movies.  This one has all three in spades.Wyman is excellent, a consummate professional. Hudson is wooden and can't act, which is what gives him his charm...who needs those incidentals when you look like that.If you purchase only one Douglas Sirk movie this is the one to own. Although Imitation of Life (1959)and All That Heaven Allows (1956) come real close.It is bad acting, bad movie, bad everything at its FINEST. Which is what makes it so GREAT!ENJOY!

$REVIEW.: If you're into the notably offbeat, this terrific film is probably for you. A creepier tale has never been told.*The Story*A young girl is reported missing on a small island off the coast of England and a Sergeant-Constable, a devoutly serious Christian, is dispatched there to look into the matter. He has to access the island by float-plane. When he arrives, it doesn't take him long to discover some elemental facts:1. He is being passively resisted, deceived, and decoyed as he seeks information about the missing girl.2. He is informed by an island patriarch that the islanders have suffered for some time due to poor agicultural harvests.3. He is personally displeased to observe that the island population is clearly comprised of a pagan culture of grinning folks with an apparent taste for bawdy buxom barmaids, Maypole celebrations, and various forms of ritual sacrifice.Things go from bad to worse for the highly-irritated policeman and then he suddenly meets with unexpected and heartening success... and then things get *really* creepy!I've watched this intriguing, terrific color film over and over for many years and I never tire of viewing it. It's perfectly cast; non-Brits can understand the localized cultural nuances of the story; the cinematography, locations, and sets are tops; the pacing is spot-on... it's really just a flawless film.Highly recommended.

$review_text.: This is an OK Leslie video, but it is the identical of the 2009 release

 Exact same one
 The case is even the same

 The 2009 is currently selling here for $7.99 (new)
 The only difference that I can see between the two releases, is that they will make a $1 donation to the Komen Foundation
 Certainly a worthy cause, but why the $6 difference in price??  Shop carefully!

$REVIEW.: i've read so much about sadie nardini and couldn't wait to try this. i'm a solid intermediate yogi, and the 1st 5-10 minutes had my lower back hurting. i didn't even bother finishing it. i just couldn't get into it, but maybe it's just me, because i've seen some great reviews for all of her videos. i much prefer Adi Amar and Oliver Reinsch's style. they both just have a much better flow to their yoga instruction that feels less forceful in my opinion.

$review_text.: This last tour of Deep Purple will be remembered as organist Jon Lord's last. This DVD and tour was better than the one in 1998. Ian Gillan's voice seems well rested and less raspy than on the last concert release. The band plays a Greatest Hits set with a few fun things thrown in like &quot;Mary Long&quot; and &quot;No One Came.&quot; What you see is a close knit group of friends making the music they love. Guitarist Steve Morse is a perfect fit and has been with the band almost 8 years. It is too bad nothing from the last studio album ABANDON was included, but all in all fine fare!Jon Lord has left the band to be replaced by Don Airey. We shall miss the master of the Hammond. I saw this tour when it came to Minneapolis, and they were a very hot band. Excellent sound quality on this DVD and good video production. Buy it.

$REVIEW.: Although highly esteemed by Classical and Romantic composers such as Beethoven and Brahms (the latter's summing-up: "what we musicians recognize as the height of dramatic music"), Cherubini's setting of Euripides, first heard in 1797 in French, all but vanished over the course of the 19th century

Today it would be as obscure as the Baroque composer Marc-Antoine Charpentier's operatic treatment of the same material were it not for the title role's emergence in the 1950s as one of Maria Callas's signature roles


The finest of her Giasones, Jon Vickers, averred that Cherubini's vengeful sorceress, not Bellini's Norma or Verdi's Violetta, was Callas's greatest portrayal

In the post-Callas period, the work again became a rarity, although it did receive one commercial recording per decade in the 1960s and 1970s, both sets conducted by Lamberto Gardelli
Gwyneth Jones and Sylvia Sass, respectively, coped with the title role.The opera's neglect, especially in the theater, is puzzling
The part of Medea is a difficult one to sing, yes, but equally or more demanding music is all over the core soprano repertoire

I believe MEDEA's obscurity can best be accounted for on two grounds
First, 19th-century operatic theaters and audiences alike were ill at ease with a work in which the central figure was a powerful and also malevolent woman

The darkest such characters in Verdi, e.g., NABUCCO'S Abigaille, were never more than co-principals, and the likes of Strauss's Salome did not begin to appear until the 20th

Bellini's Norma -- a Medea-like figure who has a warmer relationship with her romantic rival, and *considers* but ultimately does not commit a double child murder -- was and is easier to take

Second, the work may have been too musically advanced for its own good, with its prefigurations of Rossini and Bellini and beyond

Today, it does not seem strong in period charm for the late 18th century, yet is at a disadvantage in competing for attention with operas that, 30 to 50 years later, built on its achievements.A new production (sung, of course, in Italian and with recitatives rather than spoken dialogue) by Hugo de Ana was unveiled on 5 October 2008 at the Teatro Regio di Torino

This DVD appears to preserve a single performance, rather than a composite edited together from several
The action has been updated to a period that I suppose from the clothing is either the 1910s or the 1920s (de Ana also designed the costumes -- "Gatsbywear," one might say, with Neris sporting the most eccentric getup)


The opening scene of Glauce's idyll is set on a beach, and once that scene has concluded, a low-hanging screen lifts to reveal a ship, which will remain on stage for most of the opera (Medea sleeps on board)

De Ana makes some dramatic points a trifle bluntly (Medea always wears black, Glauce virginal white), but he limns the drama with efficiency and intelligence

Creonte, Glauce and their subjects are treated with great refinement; they represent the "polite society" Giasone hopes to enter as he closes the book on his past
Into this world, Medea pursues him almost as an elemental force


In the banquet she disrupts with her first, veiled appearance, the director makes an interesting choice: everyone, including Giasone, remains seated for a long time, and this is key within the production, for a display of passivity is their method of dealing with Medea

In a sense, they just hope this violating element will wear itself out and go away

When, later in that scene, Medea desperately throws herself at Giasone, he does not roughly shove her away in the usual manner for an Italian tenor (think of Turiddu in CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA); he responds to the  unwanted advance merely by keeping his arms at his sides and *not* catching her as she slides down his body to the floor -- a telling moment in de Ana's passive-versus-active mise-en-sc&egrave;ne

In several scenes, Medea is conspicuously surrounded by steamer trunks, suitcases, and boxes full of things from, presumably, happier times (at one point, singing of the children, she makes an appeal to Giasone's sentiment by showing him a photo album): the lady literally comes with a lot of baggage

Throughout, the production impresses as a thoughtful and handsome piece of work on what I assume was a modest budget
In that sense, it is close to a model of its kind.The stage is populated with good musicians who, as a bonus, make an attractive appearance
The beautiful Anna Caterina Antonacci is not as vocally well suited to Medea as to lower-lying parts she has previously essayed (Bizet's Carmen; Mozart's Donna Elvira; Verdi's Meg Page; Berlioz's Cassandre)
Her singing is well controlled for the most part, but the top is less than one could desire, and a beat intrudes on held notes (to this last, one might reasonably counter that both Callas and Jones had oft-rebellious voices, but they also brought more power and reach to it)

Antonacci's remains a commendable performance of a role that does not present us with a wide array of contemporary choices on DVD

Singing in her native language, the Italian really savors the words

Giuseppe Filianoti is a sweeter-sounding, more lyrical Giasone than the usual (again...to the degree that one can speak of "the usual" in an opera so rarely given)

Of the rest, Sara Mingardo is the standout: a firm and confident yet warm-toned Neris
Giovanni Battista Parodi makes an agreeable fellow out of Creonte

To his daughter, Glauce, Cinzia Forte brings an acceptable comprimario tone and a good enough technique for her aria

The orchestra and chorus, under the direction of Evelino Pid&ograve; and Roberto Gabbiani respectively, thoroughly exceed expectations -- Pid&ograve;, in particular, gets outstanding work from his players, and deserved the night's most generous ovation.Except for one instance of haphazard, arrhythmic editing (Medea goes into one of her cases for an item and we get a jumble of illogically sequenced cuts that could be a "what not to do" primer in some filmmaking class), this meets a high standard technically

The theater's stage is not especially large, and two cameras placed to the extreme right and left expose the limits of the painted backdrop but also give us a nicely atmospheric "smoky" effect of dust against lights
The English subtitles are generous enough in quantity but poor in quality, with awkward line breaks and many errors of punctuation and spelling ("godess" for "goddess," "heals" for "heels"), suggesting transcription by someone with limited fluency in the language

The narrative remains comprehensible, in any case


Judging from the length of time it took me to acquire this DVD, and also from its status at this writing as available only at a high price from a single Amazon Marketplace seller, there seems to be a distribution issue -- one hopes this corrects itself, for in most respects it is a release to be received gratefully.

$REVIEW.: It only runs 75 minutes and it really could serve as an educational film for new dog owners

Not from a training point of view but as an example of the many challenges the dogs offer


So often, TV and movies show training highlights that make it appear fast and easy to train a dog

A breakthrough can take a moment or years and most people would have given up on Devon quickly


I laughed out loud every time Jeff Bridges had trouble with Devon
They embarrass us, humiliate us and humble us

"You can't live here unless you change," are the same words that came out of my mouth more than once


I actually read the book a few years after I got my first Border Collie
Eventually, that dog ended up with my parents who are home all the time
Although I won't read the Katz book about Orson, I really liked his writing style and was not disappointed in the changes when A Dog Year was made into a movie

Katz is flawed but I was happy to see him speak briefly in the extra feature

I always had a mental image of Michael Moore in my head when picturing Katz
He doesn't come off as a know it all and his openness of sharing his experiences (good and bad) has invited the experts to fling a lot of single stars at his ratings

The honesty that Katz projects could prevent someone from entering into a casual commitment when trying to adopt a dog made out of pure electricity


The most valuable command is coming when you're called!

$review_text.: "Phenomena" is my personal favourite Argento film. It has practically all the elements that form other movies of Italian maestro: boarding school for girls, mysterious murderer, dreamy atmosphere, beautiful music (although I thought the soundtrack could do easily without Iron Maiden and Motorhead), hidden rooms and passages in the houses, some unexpected and unthinkable plot lines, like Jennifer Connely's character being able to communicate with insects...It's difficult, maybe even impossible to explain the beauty of Argento's pictures. I think whether you see it or not. It's like whether you love fantasy genre or not. "Phenomena" is extremely picturesque, enchanting and dark if you get into Argento's work. If you don't I guess you wouldn't be reading this. So if you enjoyed his other films like "Opera", "Inferno" or "Suspiria" you'll get a lot of pleasure watching this one.Now a few words about editions: there are about 15 different releases of different countries, and Anchor Bay one is rather good - it has commentaries and some extra features. But my pick is German 2-disc limited edition by "Dragon entertainment". It has loads of extras and some additional dialog sequences missing in AB release. This edition is rather hard to find nowdays. But if you're a die-hard fan you might have your ways...

$review_text.: An interesting attempt by DreamWorks Animation at making an animated comedy Aimed At Adults. Father of the Pride is a decidedly unexpected take on what one would expect from. a comedy about a family of White Lions. The Series has has a type of humor that at time makes you wonder how they got away with some of the jokes and situations that they did on network television. Father of The Pride Features a great voice cast, and the fictitious take on Real Life magicians Siegfried and Roy is a highlight of every episode. Of particular interest to collectors are the Un-aired pilot episodes. The series will appeal to adults that like the type of Humor found in the animated segments on Saturday Night Live's T.V. Fun House, or to adults that would like to see what an animated series about anthropomorphic Animals is like when IT IS NOT INTENDED for children.

Computer graphics are used for most of the aerial views.No female love plots or anti war stuff. Just a well made war movie like the ones produced right after ww2.It is a survival story of an south African aviator in the RAF during the war. The view point is south African, very much like the American point of view. Very different from the British movies where the war is just a negative thing and they must just carry on and endure the hardships, with very bad endings,

This year, there were a bunch of remakes like War Of The Worlds, The Longest Yard, Bad News Bears, and The Amityville Horror and so on....I dont know, I like to complain some times a lot on remakes because sometimes they do horrible jobs and sometimes they do a decent job and some surprise me. The remake of John Carpenter's 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis flick, The Fog is not that successful. I like the fog effect when the fog rolls into the town, they did a good job at that. The story consists of a town called Antonio Bay and a curse from a ship wreck which involving the towns Four Fathers. The crew from the ship are ghosts and they bring the fog along with them. A failed attempt, too bad John Carpenter didnt remake it, that would of been interesting but Rupert Wainwright's directing only goes so far and the ghosts are only effective when we cant see them up close, only when we see them from afar and walking. Starring Tom Welling (Cheaper By The Dozen movies, Tv's Smallville), Maggie Grace (Tv's LOST), Selma Blair (Cruel Intentions, Hellboy), Rade Sherbedgia (Eyes Wide Shut, Snatch) in a wasted role, Kenneth Walsh and DeRay Davis. Some pretty interesting moments direction wise, Grace and Welling cant save it, only Selma Blair rises above the rest of the cast.

$review_text.: I watched this film knowing very little about the behind the scenes about whale capturing and exploitation of the whales for monetary gain. I kind of figured they weren't as comfortable as they were before they were captured and forced to live in tiny pools compared to a mega huge ocean. After watching this film, it cemented my opinion of never going to seaworld or any aquatic park that's similar to it.First of all these are killer whales. Killer being the keyword. Nobody said they're friendly or trainable to the extend that they won't harm anyone, which unfortunately was the case in this film. I'm not blaming the trainers for being attacked. I blame the company that set up the situation to make money off of these animals. The lies and excuses they give throughout the movie is mind numbing. The interviews the former trainers gave was informative and seemingly more truthful than the proponents of keeping killer whales captive. Of course seaworld wouldn't be a part of the film. When a company does this in a documentary, it tells me that they have stuff to hide, or possibly are in more legal trouble than letting on. If they're worried about editing, they can do what Dana White of the UFC does. He has his own camera and crew filming at the same time, since espn distorted an interview he had done previously, but I digress.I like animals. I don't love animals and I'm not a member of PETA or anything like that. I like nature, nature programs and seeing animals in their natural environment. There's something really wrong with having these huge whales in these small pools and it makes me feel sick to my stomach with the way the animals are treating each other since they're trapped. If they kill each other in the wild, it's different. It's because of territory or maybe another reason, who knows, but that's nature. When you put these multi-ton animals into a cage, it's like a wrestling match and the weakest gets hurt, as shown in the movie (I don't want to get into it too much as I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the film). As we speak, sharks are eating seals, eagles are hitting goats off of mountains, and snakes are killing baby mice. It's nature and that's what they're programmed to do it. What they're not programmed to do is live in super small spaces like these whales. Most zoos are pretty good at giving animals enough space to roam and be themselves, with a couple of exceptions. I know not all zoos are 100% perfect, but I know people are keeping a close on them.Seaworld and other similar water attractions treat these animals like crap and expect them to play by the rules. a 200 pound trainer is no match for a 6 ton whale that has taken all that it's going to take, especially when you take away it's mate and children. I really wish there was a ban on these kinds of places. I know kids can like them, but it's because they don't understand and see what's really wrong here. The only way I can help out is by never ever going to any of these places and guiding my children to stay away from them.Watch this film because it's a great film and it exposes the cruelty to these animals. Free all of the killer whales back into their own habitat. Not just for the safety of the trainers, but for the sake of keeping killer whales in their own habitat where they belong.

$REVIEW.: I have not read H. Rider Haggard's novel from which the film King Solomon's Mines (1950) is based on (I'm woefully under read), but an informed source tells me the story presented here has little to do with the original work, save for the title, the main character of Alan Quartermain, and some minor details (heck, I think they even changed the main character's name, from Quatermain to Quartermain).  This seems on par for Hollywood, taking a classic story, hacking it to pieces, keeping what they deem suitable, and then filling in the rest however they see fit...sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it generally always serves to annoy someone who has read and enjoyed the original material, eliciting harsh criticisms and condemnations, but in terms of an action/adventure movie, I though it was pretty good...is it a classic?  Well, if it's not, it's only a few frames shy of being so...the film lists two directors in Compton Bennett (Man-Eater) and Andrew Marton (Seven Wonders of the World).  Given the large amount of secondary unit stuff presented in the film (those scenes not featuring the main actors, but scenes shot on location of the animals, native peoples and such), I couldn't help wonder if maybe one of these two was the second unit director who was given a full directing credit...the film stars the very attractive Deborah Kerr (From Here to Eternity, The King and I) and Stewart Granger (Scaramouche, The Prisoner of Zenda).  Also appearing is Richard Carlson (Creature from the Black Lagoon, It Came from Outer Space) along with a cast of thousands...well, more like hundreds, in the form of true African native tribes..The story is set in the year 1897 and takes place in the deep heart of darkest, equatorial Africa.  The film begins with a bang, literally, as we see Allan Quartermain (Granger) leading a hunting expedition whose prey is elephants (if you don't want to see a couple of pachyderms taken down, then fast forward or skip this film altogether...I was put off by it at first, but managed to get past it).  Seems Quartermain is feeling his years (apparently he's been leading these types of expeditions much longer than anyone else), and also seems to be feeling dissatisfaction for the work itself.  As he contemplates retiring, an opportunity to make a heaping wad of cash comes in the form of wealthy Englishwoman Elizabeth Curtis (Kerr), along with her brother John Goode (Carlson) to lead an expedition to search for Elizabeth's husband, who is lost in the jungles as he searched for the fabled King Solomon's mines.  Quartermain is hesitant at first (a woman on an expedition?!  Surely you must jest!  And don't call me Shirley!), but soon relents as it's a really huge wad of cash.  The group is soon off, traipsing into the interior, a place where few have dared venture, and none have returned.  If this sounds ominous, it's meant to as the dangers come fast and furious in the forms of hostile natives, bitey animals, treacherous terrain, and more...I did enjoy this film a lot, despite a few perceived flaws on my part.  The biggest being the first half of the film tended to get bogged down with showing as many different creatures as possible.  You name it, we saw it...I guess I can understand if you're a studio, mounting a huge production in the wilds of Africa, you're going to make damn sure you get the most of it by showing as much of the location as possible, but it became tedious after awhile.  I liked seeing the animals, but it seemed more often than not these scenes were filler rather than part of the story.  There were some scenes were the animals were incorporated (like the wild stampede scene), but this wasn't the norm...perhaps this was more intriguing to 1950's audiences, who may not have ever seen actual footage of this relatively unknown continent.  Regardless, once we get past this, the story picks up the pace, and things begin to move along.  Granger is wonderful as the virile Great White Hunter, respectful of his place within wilds, surefooted and ever vigilant of the dangers present.  I wouldn't have thought it possible given the nature of the character, but Granger infuses an underlying level of suaveness I found worked extremely well.  One aspect I really liked was they had him speak some of the native tongues, rather than having the natives speak broken English, adding credibility to the film.  Kerr is certainly beautiful, and presents a strong, yet feminine character, determined to find her lost husband for reasons all her own.  I thought the romance subplot between the characters of Quartermain and Mrs. Curtis was unnecessary and clunky, but it was minor and generally stayed out of the way.  I thought Carlson's character a bit weak, but I suppose I'm used to seeing him in starring roles in science fiction films and such, and not used to him being relegated to a rather insignificant role such as here.  His main role seemed to be to provide a linkage between Elizabeth and Allan, forwarding their characters, but not his own.  You could have removed his character from the film and ended up with about the same results.  The use of real African natives and displaying their colorful garb and rituals was a real treat, as they're not shown to be ignorant third world hold outs but intelligent, rich with culture peoples in their natural environment.I'm unsure if anything was done in terms of restoration, but the first half of the film has a light gray tinge to it, which I found a bit depressing (hence 3 stars instead of 4).  It clears around halfway through, thankfully.  The print used does show wear, but it's decent enough, and is presented in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  The audio seems very clean and clear.  The only special feature included is a extremely worn trailer.  All in all, a great film but lackluster DVD release.Cookieman108

This film left you with the feeling that it was all just thrown together, and no one took it that seriously. There were lots of things in this film that just didn't make any sense at all. Someone explain: Why was that desert chase scene filmed in night vision? WHAT IN THE HECK WAS UP WITH THAT?! The editing was choppy and scenes were just thrown together. I gave this film two stars for one reason: The skateboarding scene at the beggining was sorta cool. Thats about it.SKIP IT. "Rollerball" is a loser.

$review_text.: OUT OF TIME illustrates a predicament familiar to most men, i.e. when good sense is subverted by the promise of genital happiness with a pretty woman.Denzel Washington is Matt Whitlock, Sheriff of Banyon Key, FL. His wife Alexandra (Eva Mendes), a Miami homicide gumshoe, has moved out and is getting the divorce papers processed. In the meantime, the sheriff finds solace in the bed of Ann (Sanaa Lathan), the abused wife of jealous Chris (Dean Cain), a local morgue security guard. Paradise begins to unravel when Ann reveals that she has terminal cancer and six months to live. After an unsuccessful attempt to convert a million dollar life insurance policy into the cash needed to fund experimental cancer treatment in Switzerland, Ann makes Matt the beneficiary, and the latter &quot;loans&quot; her five-hundred grand in impounded drug money, evidence in a stalled criminal investigation, that's currently on ice in the sheriff's safe. The night after Ann takes possession of the swag, she and her husband are apparently murdered in their home, which is then torched. Alexandra is assigned to the case. Meanwhile, the cash has disappeared; Matt is identified by a non-reliable witness as the suspicious person skulking outside his paramour's home the night of the crime; and the local DEA chief has phoned to say that he's sending two of his heavies over to take possession of the drug money. Fancy dancing is in order if Matt is to stay out of Deep Bandini.The plot becomes more incredible with a compressed time frame that demands that Matt extricate himself from his mess over two 8-hour work shifts. Alexandra doesn't even have the time to change out of a gloriously short and tight miniskirt and high heels, in which outfit she manages to kick down a locked door. (At that point, my wife leaned over to whisper, &quot;Do you know what would happen if one really tried that?&quot; Perhaps she has a secret life I don't know about?)This isn't Washington's most memorable performance. But, since Denzel is one of Hollywood's most appealing actors, who cares? Matt spends the entire latter half of the film looking like a deer mesmerized by approaching highbeams while teetering on the edge of an abyss. Alexandra is constantly giving him that hard look familiar to guilty husbands everywhere that implies the question, &quot;Is there something you want to tell me?&quot; The Final Confrontation, which takes place in the familiar milieux of rain, darkness, and a creepy abandoned structure, does benefit from a satisfying plot twist.OUT OF TIME is a better than average entertainment vehicle more cost effectively viewed as a DVD rental on the small screen.

$review_text.: I was lucky enough to see this film twice in the theatre, thanks to the Wall Street Journal review.  Since them, I couldn't count how many times I've seen the movie on computer & airplane.This is one of the top 10 animes; I'd happily debate/defend that comment.The story is equal to that of written literature (is that redundant?).  Characterization & theme equal to literature.  Do I repeat myself?So... I've got a "highly sensitive" five and a half-year-old daughter who is far more sensitive than I was at that age.  We watched this movie together with no issues (other than assuring her that nothing bad would happen), and I'm very happy to sit down & watch the movie with her at a moment's notice.This movie is a joy -- positive messages, nothing objectionable, and no unnecessary hype (which nowadays is difficult to find).  Compare this movie to, say, the sarcastic garbage that is the "Shrek" franchise and I'm sure you'll see what I mean.

$review_text.: "The newspapers are black with fear, threats and rumours. The government seems powerless. A bloody confrontation between the extremist parties appears unavoidable. Despite all this, people go to work, the rain never stops and fear rises like vapour from the cobblestones". These phrases, said by an unknown narrator, are a clear description of the dark mood that permeates this film.The main character is Abel Rosenberg (David Carradine), an American circus artist who is stranded in Berlin along with his brother Max and Max's former wife Manuela (Liv Ullman), due to an injury that rendered Max unable to perform their trapeze act. Things deteriorate as they run out of money, as the general situation for all those living in Germany worsens too. It is the 1920's, and the whole country suffered from inflation, unemployment, and periodic outbursts of Anti-Jewish sentiment. Berlin wasn't a good place to live for anybody at that time, but the situation for the Rosenbergs was even worse, because they were poor, unemployed, Jewish and foreigners."The serpent's egg" (1977) begins with Max committing suicide, as an act of utmost desperation. After that, Abel is left with Manuela as his only ally in a place that steadily becomes fulls of omens presaging misfortune. To endure the mere fact of being alive when his brother is not, Abel gets drunk every day. The irreality that alcohol offers offers him is the only way of fighting fear, fear of what is happening in Berlin, and of what he sees looming in the horizon. In Abel's words, "I wake up from a nightmare, and find that real life is worse than the dream".Evidently, Abel Rosenberg is an unlikely main protagonist, because he doesn't do much, merely existing in an unfriendly environment, taking in all that is happening without doing anything to change it. But maybe that is the task that the director, Ingmar Bergman, gave to him: to act as an eyewitness of times to come.Near the end of the movie, we get an explanation regarding the title of this film. One of the secondary characters, a crazy scientist bent on experimenting on human beings, says that "... anybody who makes the slightest effort can see what is waiting in the future. It's like a serpent's egg: through the thin membranes, you can clearly discern the already perfect reptile". I think that Bergman tried to point out that the germs of Nazism were already in place long before Hitler seized power. The serpent's egg was there, and nobody tried to destroy it.On the whole, I heartily recommend this movie. It is certainly gloomy, and doesn't get better near the end. Nonetheless, it is a masterpiece, because through a simple story, dark colours, metaphors, and flawless performances the director managed to convey what the mood of 1920's Berlin might have been like, and the kind of situation that can pave the way for a totalitarianism. After watching "The serpent's egg" you won't feel like singing, but you will certainly feel like thinking...Belen Alcat

$review_text.: Like Gatchaman and the upcoming Karas (which is an anime meant to reignite the anime superhero), Casshan is a superhero anime, which is a rare thing in the anime and manga world. It follows a man with supernatural abilities, and in this case it happens to be a half-man/half-robot who has acrobatic abilities and the capability of plowing through metal with little effort. And, as an added note, Casshan was created by the very same studio that created Gatchaman and Karas, so at least this was done by the ones who know how to do it best.The story follows Casshan as he journeys across a post-apocalyptic Earth populated by robots called Neoroids. These robots are slowly destroying the human race and, except for a few pockets of resistance, they are succeeding. But the human race have found a light in the darkness in Casshan, and he battles for the human race against the Neoroids tyrant leader, BK1, also known as the Black King. He's not alone in his efforts, for following him is a childhood friend who happens to have the blueprints for a weapon that could change the war, as well as Casshan's cybernetic dog.Casshan is no masterpiece, but it has a special place for me since it was one of the first anime I was able to see, back when the Sci-Fi Channel had an anime block. It has some solid action, great animation considering the time, and a decent dubbed track, even if it is a bit melodramatic at times. In a lot of ways, Casshan is reminiscent to Vampire Hunter D, so if you enjoyed that classical work of anime, then you'll probably enjoy Casshan as well.(NOTE: This is not volume 2. Casshan is only a four episode OVA, which is contained in its entirety on this DVD. Amazon.com has made a mistake in titling this DVD version.)

$REVIEW.: Okay.  I must admit I only watched this series because I had watched the first season of the current Nikita starring Maggie Q.  I also was ordering something on Amazon and added this DVD to get to $25 and free shipping.  The series--or the first few episodes--were watchable but that's about it.  The writing and story lines were less than compelling and the main character so obviously miscast as to be laughable.  Other than the fact that she is blond and thin what exactly is the attraction of the actress?  Many times she simply stares into space as if trying to either remember her lines or remember how she should react--or act--in a given situation.  Also, is she supposed to be Aussie or American?  Half the time her accent slips up and she sounds like the Australian that she is.  Surely there are hundreds of blond, blue-eyed, anorexic looking American actresses with little acting talent who could have had this part.I tried to give the show the benefit of the doubt and vowed to watch the entire first season.  Unfortunately I could not get pass the third episode.  Save the time and watch the current series with Maggie Q.  At least she has more acting ability to go with her visual appeal--which is also considerably more than Peta Wilson's.

$review_text.: There are many changes to this adaptation of Emma that mirror the book more closely and give more insight into the characters, owing to not being limited by a film's 2-hour time limit
 All these additions (different from the Paltrow version) I absolutely relished


Knightly, Mr
Woodhouse, The Eltons, The Taylors, Harriet, and the Bateses--all lovely


 The one flaw is Emma herself.Subtlety, thy name is not Romola Garai

 Unfortunately, Romola is so clownish in her mannerisms, always pulling faces to a cartoonish degree, so distinctly modern, that it is quite distracting and stupid to behold


 Harriet acts more lady-like than she!  Emma should be the picture of ladylike manners--the height of Highbury society and refinement--she is a town patroness of sorts and respected and deferred to by all

 Instead, here she has the bad manners of a modern-day girl with no care for the exertion or modesty appropriate to the Regency period in which the character lives

She is very vulgar and shows no delicacy, no moderation, no refinement, no reserve that a gentleman's daughter ought to embody and be a model of

 She is openly ridiculous
 When Mrs


Elton rolls her eyes at Emma's flagrantly bad behavior at the picnic, you can't help but agree!Gwyneth Paltrow did a better job of being elegant AND portraying Emma's imperfections at the same time: meddling, impertinent, misunderstanding, etc., with a heart beneath it all (Paltrow's Emma is less conceited than the book's heroine)


 Romola Garai instead brings out even MORE impertinence and conceit than the book

 Romola takes the 4 episodes to bring you back to her side and she changes some of her worst flaws (sadly, not her bad acting habits)--I commend her because she pulls that off
At the end, I do believe she is reformed

BUT, it is so hard to forgive Garai for her over-the-top facial expressions!  She also has poor posture (she slouches and walks like a modern girl), shouting or screaming dialogue, and even shouting "Woooooo!!!" several times at the ball as if she was at a rock concert


She even dances like a farmer's daughter

 The actress portraying Mrs
Taylor is a good example of "acting your thoughts in a subtle way" with small looks and slight expressions, rather than making your face EXPLODE as Garai does to convey the same thing

 Now, Garai has a few wonderful moments of pure, simple acting, but then in the next scene, she ruins it again by over-acting
 It's too bad the director wasn't stricter with her--I felt that with more direction on what NOT to do, she would have been great.If you can get past how anachronistic she is, however, you will enjoy this

I actually hated the series the first time I saw it--angry with Garai the whole time for ruining it


 The second time I saw it a long while after, I enjoyed it heartily, despite being aware of the problems with her performance

Besides Emma herself, the rest of the series is really stellar: from design and production value to script, ensemble cast, costumes, etc..
I recommend this for fans of Austen with the thought that you might enjoy it more once you make peace with Garai's garish portrayal of Emma, or the second time around.

$review_text.: First, I want to say that more than anything, this movie is just plain sad.  It is a case study for how to take beautiful material, and completely destroy it.The first mistake the filmmakers made, was to not be faithful to the excellent classic short story by of the same name by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.  Had they actually made a movie that was faithful to her excellent work, then this movie might not have turned out so awful.  In the end, they included just enough references to the short story, (such as character names, the title, the daughter, etc.) to cash in on the fame of the short story, but changed enough of the storyline, (making the husband the central character and the pathetic ending) to make the movie horrible.While not all bad, the bad portions so completely overwhelm the good, that you will find yourself wondering why you wasted the time.The Good:1.  The performances by the females....especially Juliet Landau, who would have been perfect if the movie had actually been a faithful representation of the short story. There are some great actors in this film.....Juliet Landau, Veronica Cartwright, Michael Moriarty and Dale Dickey.  They deliver subtle yet thoughtful performances and  all do as well as they possibly could have, considering the bad writing.  By the end of the film I felt sorry for them.2.  The cinematography is beautiful and appropriate for the film.  Especially the backlit scenes.The Bad:1.  The disjointed and irrelevant scenes.  Particularly the duel and desert scenes, which don't fit the film, provide no explanation, and add nothing to the story.2.  The predictable "easy way out", and disappointing ending.  So much time is spent building the suspense that the ending is fairly anticlimactic.3.  The music is completely over the top, melodramatic, and just plain bad.  So bad in fact, that at times it is laughable.  It desperately tries to create a sense of fear and suspense, building to an almost manic crescendo, then cuts to a sunny scene of the front of the house.  It does this sort of thing so often, that when it comes to a scene that might truly be scary, the music is now ineffective and you have learned to ignore it.The Ugly:1.  The truly horrible job of the lead actor, Aric Cushing.  He must be one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and delivers a performance so deadpan and uninspired that anyone off the street could have done better. Compound this with the fact that he is not only the main character, but also the narrator. I couldn't figure out how he got the part until I read on IMDB that he is also credited as Executive Producer. Ahhhhh....that explains a lot.2.  The disjointed nature of the movie.  The filmmakers took just enough details from the short story to intrigue you, yet change enough of the movie to make it seem like they were just capitalizing on the fame of the short story.  Case in point - the title.  The Yellow Wallpaper, you would imagine, would at least have a role in the story, but it seems that these scenes were cut out.  In fact, it seems like the movie was supposed to be one concept, and that they changed it midway through....hence the duel and desert scenes, which almost seem to be added as filler.  The choice to focus on the husband as the main character, especially when portrayed by such an inept actor, is extremely disappointing.Despite the questionable glowing reviews, I invite you to see it for yourself, and judge whether what I say is true....if you can stay awake.

$REVIEW.: There has never been another hour long television program quite like "Naked City". For those unfamiliar with this gem, the series takes place in New York City circa 1958-1963 and is filmed on location. Though the series is known for its humanist approach to the depiction of crime, this is no mere parlor drama: there is action aplenty and wide dramatic street scenes, shoot outs and car chases.Prior to this complete set release, only some fifty episodes of one hundred and thirty-eight had been made available. That makes for another eighty-eight tales even if you own the previously released mini-sets! For fun, look up the locales featured in the show on Google Earth and see how things have changed or not. Notice pop-culture history in the making in the show's backgrounds, such as a copy of Spider-man's first appearance on a newsstand rack!"Naked City" is anchored by four main characters, three of them police officers of varying ages and fourth is the youngest officer's artist girlfriend. Sometimes these characters are the focus of the tales told, other times they are merely incidental as we follow one of the "eight million stories in the naked city". Like a box of chocolates, the audience never knows what it's going to get! Unlike that other great police show, "Law and Order", the program's clock-time gives no clues to what will happen next or the outcome of each story.For the uninitiated, you will thrill to the appearance by a great many fine character actors and up and coming stars as they appear in significant roles. "Naked City" certainly brings out the best in them and asks that they draw deep to meet the challenge of the roles they portray. Similar concurrent "story oriented" programs that are still popular today, like the Twilight Zone or Alfred Hitchcock Presents", will seem positively mainstream in comparison with TNC. TNC is often existential, and there is a dream-like quality to many episodes. Characters pour their souls into the dialogue - they say the things we never would have the nerve to in real life with their hearts and minds open - painfully so. Being a drama, it is appropriate that each major character seems like a walking talking raw nerve but the honesty in their portrayals goes beyond what is required to entertain and demands a response from the audience.In one episode, when the father of a lost legally blind boy tells the police that when his son was born blind, after two prior miscarriages, he stopped going to church, the moment is painfully real - yet dreamlike because we conceive that no one would ever actually admit that to a stranger. In TNC, all hearts are open and the audience is required to look and feel. These eight million stories require us to participate emotionally, and it's a pity that only 138 were committed to film. This is such a different experience from any other television series that watching TNC today with even a cursory knowledge of what was broadcast in the early 1960s leads one to almost disbelieve that this program was ever shown in the United States, much less created here.But it was and it is pure New York, and now everyone can once again appreciate the drama, suspense and beauty of one of television's finest moments. This series should have been available years ago, certainly before such fare as the complete "Gilligan's Island", or other such tripe, were available. "Naked City"'s dvd debut in complete format marks the last of the great television series I intend to purchase. To say that the best was saved for last would be all too true.You're in for a treat.******************************************************************************************So, at last I have the complete series set in hand and am pleased to note that the four individual season cases, while latching weakly, contain one sided discs each on its own spindle the disc break-up being 5-8-8-8. No booklets included. Comes in a cardboard sleeve/box open at one end. I was afraid it might be two sided discs on plug-spindles or overlapping ones, but no.Bargains are available for this series: I paid sixty-five, shipped. Happy Hunting!

$review_text.: The newest  Disney animation takes us into the very early years of N.America & the Native Americans.It is a Story of revenge ,paying the price for revenge , Learning too respect  those who are defferent from you .Most of all it is about seeing the world through anothers eyes.Kenai -is the youngest of three brothers..He looks foward too the day he gets his totem and is able too place his hand print on the stone wall of his people.On the day he is too get his totem -he carelesssly leaves a full fish net -dangling from a tree..Kenai is giving a bear symbolizing love as a sprite guid.Besides the fact he doesn't care for bears the object of love brings redicule .Fustraited  he returns too his net full of fish


only too find bear tracks leading away from the net.He tracks the bear with his brothers close behind.This leads too his oldest brothers death

Kenai feels the need for revenge against the monster -despite warning from the shaman and his other brother Sitka.He gets his revenge but as a price the great spirits  turn him into a bear...the old shaman tells him he must travel too the northern lights too regain his human form.Kenai is quickly joined by a talkative bear cub named Koda and two comical mooses.there journey through a lush woodland with towering water falls and glacier formations  is hurried by the pursuit of Sitka(who has mistaken the bear who is Kenai for the bear who took away his last brother)

$review_text.: This 1994 film was adapted from a play by Argentinean playwright Ariel Dorfman and was directed by Roman Polanski.  Set in an unnamed South American country, three people are thrown together in an isolated house on a dark and stormy night.  The woman, played by Sigourney Weaver is clearly troubled and sad.  Her husband, played by Stuart Wilson, is late for dinner.  Turns out he had a flat tire and a stranger helped him out.  That stranger, who is a doctor, played by Ben Kingsley, soon befriends the husband.  The woman thinks the stranger is the man who tortured her while she was a political prisoner many years before.There is a new kinder and gentler government now, which is investigating atrocities from the past.  The woman's husband is in charge of the investigation, which is basically focused on identifying bodies and is giving amnesty to many of the worst criminals.  Naturally this complicates the situation.What follows is not a simple story though because, throughout, questions are raised that have no easy answers.  Is the doctor really the torturer or an innocent man?  After all, it all happened at least ten or more years in the past and the woman has never actually seen her torturer's face as she had been blindfolded the whole time.  The doctor declares his innocence.  At times, he's even charming.  But she has tied him up and is determined to get a confession out of him.There are many interwoven themes.  The basic one is wondering if the doctor is, indeed, the right man.  But then there is the relationship between the husband and the wife.  We discover he and his wife were both members of the revolution but only she was caught and tortured.  He has been trying to make that up to her for their whole marriage.  We also get to hear a lot about the details of the torture.  It is chilling and disturbing and, even though the only violence in the film is against the suspect who is tied up, the woman's prison experience, which is only talked about and not shown, is excruciatingly painful to hear about.There are other questions raised too.  What happens to a society when it gives someone power over a helpless person?  Now, we see the woman with power over the tied-up doctor. And we are forced to think about how this kind of power corrupts a whole society.  This is a concept that is universal, as fresh today as it has always been.  And the director certainly knows how to bring it out. All of the actors were sensational.  I soon forgot they were performing and was completely swept into the story.  I could feel the pain of all three characters as well as the horror of the electric shocks of the past.The title comes from a string quartet by Franz Schubert called Death and the Maiden.  This piece of music had been played during the woman's torture. She has found a tape of it in the doctor's car and plays it throughout.  It helps to frame the action, right down to the film's excellent and satisfying conclusion.I was surprised to discover that this film had won no significant awards and got little recognition when it was released.  It wasn't even given a high rating from the critics.  That's too bad.  I think that it is an important film.  I'm glad I discovered it though.  It's sad and serious and ultimately meaningful on many levels.  And I give it my very highest recommendation.

$review_text.: Sometimes the force of circumstances is just too powerful.When Onegin befriended Vladimir, he wasn't condescending at all; and when the latter was down, his heart was so broken as when he was rejected by Tatyana. But being so sophisticated and well read, to be honest, how could he admire Vladimir's poems when he didn't even admire Schubert?  He was intellectually an avant-garde much influenced by Rousseau: he disapproved of serfdom and he was sick of the decadent life in St Petersburg. He was full of ideas and he even questioned the institution of marriage when adulteries were so widespread. And Tatyana for all her attraction she stood for,  was so young...Onegin did spot the difference between Tatyana and her easy sister and remarked that a poet should seek for Tatyana instead.  Yet, young she might be, she was faithful and remained faithful despite the dreadful force of love. So in life there is, as in Dr Zhivago, nobility after all inspite of age and inspite of background: inspite of everything. But the notion of love in Russia in those days was too much a luxury, and through the influence of her family, her mother, grandmother etc she had to marry after standing against them for three whole years for Onegin's reply was still not forthcoming-- and it was not until another three years that Onegin had self-realization, knowing more about love and he was more than adequately punished for his lateness. But who can boast he knows love until he himself is ensnared by love itself? But the timing proves tragic to both of them...Definitely one of the best films these years, even better than Tess of Durberville. Strongly recommended.

$review_text.: I loved this film when it was released in theaters.  Superman was my introduction to movie superheroes and I held the memory fondly.  The decades has tarnished the experience and this blu-ray's &#34;extended&#34; edit only amplified some of the problems.  Its now a mixed bag with some very strong material dragged down by some very bad moments that were more acceptable decades ago but which don't play well now.Everything involving Superman's background story is very, very good.  You get rock solid performances from everyone.  In this intro, you have Marlon Brando and Glenn Ford and they give some of the best on-screen artistry you will ever find.  The acting in the rest of the film is also good, with Gene Hackman shining above the rest.Unfortunately, when Superman actually appears, things go downhill.  Reeves does well with the bumbling Clark Kent role.  Kidder comes off as selfish and unlikeable and is a damsel in distress that you don't really care about saving.  Reeves goes through the motions with one exploit after the other but there isn't much worth watching beyond Gene Hackman's portrayal as Lex Luther.And that's where the extended cut really fails.  It minimizes Hackman as a nemesis and focuses on Reeves in a lot of badly matted flying scenes that really suffer on an HDTV.  Superman's heroics towards the end of the film are so over the top as to make any of his efforts seem silly.  (To be fair, I found these events tolerable when I first saw the film but now they really wear thin.)  The extended cut only amplifies the weak issues and buries the really good parts.  In the end, you're looking at a film that was definitely a product of its time and should be enjoyed for great performances by some fine actors but which wavers badly in its modern presentation.If you can get the original theater release I'd go with that.  They edited it that way for a reason.

Gordon brought us TORMENTED in the early sixties, not long after the prime psychological thriller PSYCHO filled audience's hearts with a new kind of fear---not monsters, but monsters within us.  In TORMENTED, Richard Carlson mugs his way through the role of jazz pianist Tom Stewart, who tells his latest mistress (played by the bosomy Juli Reding) that their affair is over and he is planning on marrying the wealthy daughter of a corporate giant.  She taunts him and in an accident at the lighthouse, she falls to her death.  Tom could have saved her, but he lets her die.  The movie grows a little tedious as we wonder if Tom's guilty conscience is getting the better of him, or is the ghost of Vi walking the beaches?  The special effects are appropriately laughable and the ending is telegraphed from the moment Vi falls to her death, but for a psychological B movie ala DEMENTIA 13, TORMENTED is fairly enjoyable.

$review_text.: This is a review of the Blu-ray edition, a three-disc set, two of which are in standarddefinition


How does BOAN appear in Blu-ray? Nothing revelatory here

It claims to be mastered in HD from archival 35 mm elements, not newly restored
The 1993 restoration is ondisc 2 in standard definition (and full screen)  It is nice to see the film in what is presumably the correct aspect ratio on blu ray


 This is probably about as good as the filmis ever going to look, and it is satisfactory, considering we are dealing with a film madealmost a hundred years ago


And in one medium to long shot, I thought I could seeon the neck of the female actor who played Mammy, obviously in blackface, the point wherethey forgot to make up entirely the back of her neck

The picture certainly has never lookedbetter on any home video medium
Whether it looks better than the standard definitionversion on disc 2 is perhaps debatable.However, the blu-ray disc is,in my judgment, marred by the decision to include a newly composed score as the only music scoreoption


I find it to be undistinguished for the most part


 After watching the blu-raydisc with this option several days ago, I viewed several portions of the film last nightin the standard definition format (disc 2)


Here we are given the 1993 restoration of DavidShepard with a 1993 adaptation of the original score of Joseph Carl Breil


This consistsof period-specific music such as "Bonnie Blue Flag," the infamous "Dixie," "Year of Jubilo,"and other American compositions, as well as the work of several nineteenth-century composers(I recall hearing strands of what I believe were Rubinstein's "Ocean" Symphony as well asa composition of Edvard Grieg)


The battle scenes in the film are much more stirring whenaccompanied by the period music rather than the newly minted score

That being said, onthe blu-ray disc, we are given two audio options for the new Mont Alto Orchestra score, 2.0Stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1

No complaints about the sound here, simply about the lackof the Breil score option on the blu-ray disc

This same disc includes the filmed introductionof D.W


Griffith and Walter Huston
Here blu ray does serve to noticeably enhance thepicture from its original incarnation on a Kino standard definition edition of the film,at least insofar as memory serves correctly--I no longer own that standard definition version.Disc 3, also standard definition, contains Griffith's shorter Civil War films, but alsoextensive documentation of "New York versus The Birth of a Nation," centered on the legalbattles to prevent its showing in New York upon its re-release in 1922
It's fascinatingmaterial, presenting the opposing contentions that initial screenings of the film in 1915did or did not produce riots


Thus, we are shown that not only the content of the filmbut its effects on the public are controversial and in dispute
I discovered by internetresearch that it is even disputed whether President Woodrow Wilson actually uttered hisfamous description of the film as "history written with lightning." The section on the 1922litigation also offers some interesting philosophical reflections on cinema's potential effects on public morality, clearly an issue that has not gone away.This film seems to cry for a commentary on the blu-ray disc, both as to the historicity orlack of same of some of the film's claims about historical events and as to its effectson the public
But alas, who would give an objective commentary, could any American, livingor dead, untouched by the passions which have swirled about the film since its release,accomplish the task? Part of the problem, of course, is that Birth of a Nation was basedon two virulent novels by Thomas Dixon, a racist if ever there was one


But there is alsothe problem that Griffith seems to be expressing the synthesis, or majority view of hisgeneration, arising from the clash of thesis (Reconstruction) with antithesis (Southernresistance, the Klan, etc.) Thus, he appeals to the authority of Woodrow Wilson as historianin several of his intertitle cards to substantiate his historical claims

Moreover, heactually celebrates the death of states' rights in another intertitle card! Upon closerexamination, there may be something to offend people of all political persuasions in the film.This film, of course, is distinguished by its almost complete lack of subtlety.The power of its images is such that it is a legitimate question about itseffects on the viewer


Though it is a silent film, and the acting styles are quaint andoutmoded, still one has to wonder if it is really so far removed from Oliver Stone's "JFK,"for example, another film which has been accused of manipulating history


And does notall film manipulate in the name of artistic license? If a picture really is worth a thousandwords, isn't the motion picture viewer a thousand times more vulnerable to suggestion,even "corruption" of his values than a reader, who at least can control the pace at whichhe peruses a book or reject it more easily than the mesmerizing form of a film?All in all, this is a release worth owning, perhaps more for the supplements on discs2 and 3 as for the feature film in blu ray


It is not so much entertainment as it iseducational in nature, though it must be admitted that scenes in the film still retaina power of storytelling that engendered much of the controversy over its effect on thepopulace

It probably does accurately mirror the majority view of white Americans in the early20th century, admittedly racist


I give this release four stars because of the failure toinclude the Breil score option on the blu ray, a serious omission when dealing with a filmwhose greatest claim to fame is its importance for the history of American and world cinema.One wants to view such a historical film accompanied by music such as its original audienceswould have heard.A couple of afterthoughts
I personally, as a Christian, am offended by the Klan's useof the cross, as when they rush to the rescue of the parties trapped in the little cabin.At the same time, I realize that such use in the picture probably reflects a historicalreality
The point I was trying to make about a commentary is that it would take a verybrave man indeed to do a full and complete commentary on this film, subject as he wouldbe to possible vituperation from many different quarters
If, as I believe, all cinemaworthy of the name has a point of view and is therefore propaganda in some sense, thisone at least has the merit that it is overt and blatant and not concealed
That may notmake it any the less dangerous


Finally, a review on another website suggests thatthe Mont Alto score on the blu-ray disc is indeed the original score played with themovie when it first appeared


If that is the case, then the information on the packagingprovided by Kino is misleading, since it calls the Breil score the "original." Finally,I have never purchased a disc that was as difficult to extract from its cardboard slipcaseas this one

I was almost on the point of cutting it open with scissors when I finallymanaged to pull it out
Subsequent attempts to pull the discs out were just as arduous,with the result that I am now shelving the discs in the plastic container without thecardboard slipcase.

$REVIEW.: Some remakes are welcomed, even if most are dreadfully unappealing.  Sometimes the right director can take something we know and love and transfer it with the right amount of freshness that we feel compelled to watch it.  I remember recent films like `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and `King Kong' being just as good if not better than the originals.  But there are always the films you wish they'd leave alone because they can never be done as well as they were the first time.I hate referencing Van Sant's 1998 debacle `Psycho' when speaking of Haneke's remake of his own 1997 German thriller, but they are alike in on particular instance.Both are unnecessary.Both films are a shot-for-shot, scene-for-scene, word-for-word remake of the original, and thus both films have a feeling of redundancy that doesn't go away.  The difference between the two is that Haneke's second attempt still feels pristine, complete with stellar performances and signature direction.  Van Sant's film was abysmal.  Still, regardless of how good this film is, there is no denying that it has no purpose, other than to reach an American audience who would really serve themselves well to seek out the original (why is it that we as American's have such a fear of subtitles?).The film is really so much more than a film, for it is not meant to be entertaining.  It is a message film, a film that is meant to shock us into our senses.  It is masterfully crafted by Haneke to ask us the all important question of why; why are we so obsessed with that which we are so afraid?  He attacks our society, a society bent on entertaining ones self with gore and death and horror.  Having the attackers ask us outright how we would handle the situation is pure genius.Are we really so diluted that we dare play along?The performances this go around are just as engrossing as those in the original.  Naomi Watts is flawless as the tormented wife and mother Ann.  The disturbing close ups of her frazzled expressions and tear soaked cheeks are heartbreaking and raw.  She steps into Susanne Lothar's shoes effortlessly.  Tim Roth is not as effective as Ulrich Muhe, but he works well enough.  He has a very warm and inviting face, which I hadn't noticed until this film.  I really felt for him throughout, you just don't want bad things to happen to him.  Michael Pitt was the biggest surprise for me, in a good way.  I have never been drawn to him as an actor, but I must admit that the trailer's for the film made me rethink that.  He was the most compelling visual there, his arrogance playing so well into his character and I must say that he is truly the films highlight.  Such a richly cold character, effortlessly charming and charismatic and hateful.  Brady Corbet plays second fiddle well enough, but he can't really hold his own against Pitt.So, if you have not seen the original and dislike subtitles then by all means watch this movie.  It is brutal and frustrating and heartbreaking to say the least, but it carries the weight of an important message well.  It is not mainstream and it will not end as you expect and it will not deliver the type of `good feeling' thrills that many mainstream horror movies deliver, but if you look at it for what it is and commit to understanding it then you will see it for the masterpiece it is.Haneke is a genius.I consider his original the greatest horror film of all time (on most days at least) and highly recommend it.  This one would have been a masterpiece as well had it not been a remake.  The fact that it has no differing factors makes it feel repetitious.  I didn't feel a need to keep watching despite all the pros presented.  It misses out on a five star review from me for that very reason.

$review_text.: This movie really bugged me (pun intended)


 It follows the relationship of a paranoid schizophrenic and a woman at a run down motel
 For whatever reason she seems to like this guy even though he's quirky and convinced the US Army placed bugs in his system
 He cuts himself, pulls his own teeth out and generally freaks out in every scene trying to reconcile himself to the bugs living inside him.Eventually he convinces his girlfriend that she too has bugs inside her

 By the end of the movie they have decorated their motel room in tin foil so the bugs cannot transmit signals to each other.I can't help but think this movie was a waste of time and money and the acting really isn't all that remarkable, either.

$review_text.: Here is the life of Christ depicted in the political climate in which He appeared.  In fact, the first few minutes of the film will make you wonder if you are watching the right movie, as it reviews the Roman invasion of Judea.  The Romans, the family of Herod, the Sanhedrin and Barabbas with his Zealots all play roles in the trajedy.Samuel Bronston, a producer whose production center was located outside of Madrid, envisioned a shorter movie along the artistic lines of "The Gospel According to St. Matthew," simple and reverent.  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer saw the movie as a threat to its' current blockbuster hit, "Ben-Hur."  Bronston needed some additional financial backing and MGM stepped in, so that the release could be delayed until after "Ben-Hur" was finished with its' usual one year playing engagement.  At the same time, the tremendous audience response to the spectacle of "Ben-Hur" convinced MGM to expand the film and make it more spectacular.  At least an additional 45 minutes was tacked on the planned running time.I find the film a great success.  By giving us the political milieu, it provides us a different slant on the well-known story and invokes interest with sub-plots.Jeffrey Hunter took a lot of unnecessary abuse for his portrayal.  This was the first portrayal of Jesus by an actor who was around the same age as Christ during the events, but he was criticized as too young (???).  His piercing blue eyes added a sharp edge to his appearance, making him symbolically stand out as unique.  He depicted an accessible Jesus.  This was certainly in evidence during the Sermon on the Mount scene.  In no other movie, I feel, does Jesus come down off the lofty pedestal and talk directly to you.  The Sermon on the Mount scene starts with the Beatitudes but becomes a conversation between the audience and Jesus, at times, questioning Him directly on who He really is.  Here, Jesus becomes human, and it is thanks to Jeffrey Hunter's heartfelt performance.  To contrast the human element is some of the most incredibly moving miracles ever filmed, establishing his Divinity.  The healing of the crippled boy never fails to elicit a tear.The other performances are just as good.  The political and action sequences around the sacred story are interesting and exciting.  The sets and the photography are appropriate for the spectacle but not terribly overdone.  And, last but not least, is Miklos Rozsa's incredible music score, one of his best.Although lambasted when it first appeared during the media backlash against spectacles (although the audience disproved the critics by making this one of the best grossing films of the year), this film gains in reputation as the years move on.  One of my personal favorites!  We need this on DVD!

Sad that they didn't see fit to carry this series to fruition, but HBO and Showtime are famous for that sort of junk.Anyway, an interesting show with an interesting cast and an interesting concept.  Extremely entertaining.  I little bit of language and some brief nudity, but not as bad as many other shows on premium channels.As long as you understand that this is an incomplete series (supposed to have been a trilogy, but was cancelled after the 2nd season) going in you won't be disappointed.

The music is very trendy and new century, but at times not as good as billed?Over all it was an entertaining movie:a fluff piece.

$REVIEW.: Machete Kills reminds me of the great action films from the 1970s. It's sure to impress older moviegoers and younger folks, much in the same way Chuck Norris has become a household name with teenagers.My name is Ed Rubinstein and I operate the Young Mariners Society. We're a small nautical league of aspiring seafaring boys that I run from my boat here in Iowa. We spend countless nights on my boat just a few yards from the lake. Eventually, when the repairs are complete, we will take the boat out on the water. I know I worked those boys hard this summer, but it was the only way I knew how to prepare them for manhood. Much of their training was based off of the television show `Deadliest Catch' along with the movies `Cabin Boy 'and `Down Periscope.'Upon graduation, several of my well-instructed little seamen have taken upon themselves the distinguished title of &#34;Mariner.&#34;Winning the rope swinging competition this past summer with my boys, I gave them a night off from our rigorous activities to enjoy a little R&R; with a movie night. Without a doubt, they earned it. This movie was selected for its theme of maturation from boy to man.Much to everyone's delight, this movie was a hit. Actor Danny Trejo is the modern day equivalent of a Chuck Norris, Dolph Lundgren and Jean Claude Van Damme all rolled into one.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent action film sure to impress the young & old! Reminds me of Chuck Norris & other 1970s action movies. A++

$review_text.: A good classic film from the 50's. The fact you are looking at this you probably know already. What you might not know is next. 1:85 is made from 35mm film that is cropped in the viewfinder, top and bottom at the time of shooting. During the days of VHS why would a studio crop a 1:85 to full screen when the film minis the crop was already full screen. If it is a major film they might have done pan & scan but a lesser film, just scan it as is. You can see the cost savings. This appears to be the case also with some full screen DVDs but to a lesser degree. I believe "It! The Terror from Outer of Space" and "The Monster that Challenged the world" are these full prints. Just set your DVD player to full and TV to Zoom. Your player and TV may us different terminology. I watched It! and Monster this way (Wide 16:9) and it works! No heads cut off. No missing action. You'll notice the title and credits fit perfectly. (If they don't you don't have the set up right.) It actually played better because the close up added tension. No extraneous views of sets or background. Just as I'm sure the director and cinematographer wanted. Just crop it and watch it in wide screen.

$REVIEW.: "About a Boy" is a great romantic comedy based on Nick Hornby's best-selling novel


[I haven't read it.] It's not an ordinary entry in its genre because of its points of view [those of an eleven year old boy who's old for his years and a thirty-eight year old man who's never grown up] and its refusal to follow the normal boy-gets-girl formula


The story could easily have veered into the maudlin and sentimental, but directing brothers Chris and Paul Wiesz ["American Pie"] inject wit and often acerbic humor at just the right moments.Will [Hugh Grant] lives off the royalties from a hit song his decesased father wrote


He keeps telling himself that the axiom `No man is an island' is no longer true in our world filled with technological marvels


He uses his money to live well and his good looks to get women


One day he discovers the world of single mothers and decides to invent a child of his own in order to charm these women
The plan works well enough at first, but when he meets a lonely boy [Nicholas Hoult] and his depressed mom [Toni Colette], he finds himself in a situation where, for the first time in his life, someone else's happiness might be more important than his own.Hugh Grant is an acting treasure

The movies today are filled with plenty of tough guys and rough guys, sweet ones and soft ones

Grant is one of the few actors around who are charming, funny and sophisticated in a loveable bad boy way


This may be his best performance to date - other contenders include "Bridget Jones's Diary" and "Four Weddings and a Funeral"


Newcomer Nicholas Hoult is great, playing the boy as eccentric and worldly wise rather than as cute and cuddly
Toni Colette plays his mother and is superb as always.There have been several decent romantic comedies in the last year or so, but "About a Boy" is one of the few I can describe as "Brilliant!"


$SUMMARY.: In a word - Brilliant!

$review_text.: All three of the LOTR film are timeless classics and some of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my life. All three films were extremely powerful, immensely emotional, unbelievably gut wrenching and epic beyond words.So now, Nine years later, a prequel trilogy is being made with Peter Jackson back in the director's chair. That alone had me sold. What could possibly go wrong? Actually, I think a more fitting question to ask is &#34;What the hell went wrong?&#34;There is a rather rough transition from &#34;The Return of The King&#34; to &#34;An Unexpected Journey&#34; as far as tone goes. King was an all-out war movie. The film was literally three and a half hours of huge battles. &#34;Journey&#34;, however, is an all-out kid's movie, which brings me to my first point.One of the two problems I had with the film was just how juvenile it was. I guess that could be my fault for going to see movie based on kid's book. But, as a prequel to the LOTR films, I thought it would be a little more, well, mature. The film has everything from burping contests to snot jokes to even a sing along musical number. (That seen had me crouching down in my seat, embarrassed that I was seeing this film on my own time.)The second problem I had was the pacing. The first hour of the film is so slow. Way too much exposition! It's like a half hour of old Bilbo giving backstory to 45 minutes of the Dwarfs singing and going over plans at Bilbo's house. Even when the new adventure begging, thing barley pick up, as they keep on stopping to give us more exposition.Ok, I'm done with the bad stuff. On the other hand: the last hour of the film was consistently entertaining. In fact, Peter Jackson threw in a few scenes that brought back warm memories of the last 3 films. 1st: He adds moments that let us have a glimpse of the enormous heart that made the other films so unforgettable. Gandalf's speech about heroes to Cate Blanchet and Bilbo's speech to Dwarfs about Home at the end of the film were both touching.There were two other scenes that genuinely moved me. The first was the scene where Bilbo is invisible because of the Ring and he holds his sword up to Gollum&#8217;s neck. He is about to swing, but Gollum then turns around and can see that he is destroyed and heartbroken over the loss of the ring, his big blue eyes holding in tears. Bilbo lowers the sword.The second the last scene when Thorin finally accepts Bilbo. He starts yelling at Bilbo about how he knew from the beginning that Bilbo would be nothing but a useless burden and would do nothing but get in the way. He then finishes by breaking down and saying that he's never been more wrong in his life. When he hugged Bilbo, my heart honestly skipped a beat.The emotional moments were only half of what made the other trilogy so great. The other half is being so genuinely epic. There is a scene at the end when Thorin lays eyes on the Orc leader who..., wronged him in some way years earlier. Thorin lifts up his sword and in slow motion, runs at the Orc across the burning tree with the song playing from LOTR when the hooded riders are chasing Frodo on their black horses.Also, Christopher Lee's cameo was a very present surprise.(surprise to me at least. I guess I didn't read the cast list beforehand. Up until the credits rolled I thought Legolas was going to be in it. I kept on waiting for him to show up, even in the final scene.)It's the warm memories from LOTR that would make me recommend the film to any (patient) moviegoers.

$REVIEW.: Age six to ten audiences usually get the short end of the stick when it comes to major feature films. Although technically films like "Elf" and "Toy Story" target this demographic, the marketing people insist that these productions incorporate adult elements and humor to expand the target audience and maximize attendance; these are called "family films" and the additional elements take much away from the identification experience that children most enjoy. The only escape from these multi-generational things are preschool stuff like "Clifford's Really Big Movie" and "Muppets from Space" which no one in the 6-10 group would admit to watching, let alone liking.Then along comes Robert Rodriguez with "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl", a film that gives 6-10 audiences exactly what they want without even the slightest attempt to appeal to older viewers (well maybe middle schoolers will get crushes on Sharkboy and Lavagirl). Since this is a new animal to most critics, it gets blasted for not being what they wanted it to be, a family film. And teenagers complain that it is not as good as "Spy Kids", a Rodriguez film that not only targeted a broader audience but which most of them watched several years ago when they were preteens. To be fair, while Rodriguez did not make "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl" for 14 year olds who saw "Spy Kids" 4-5 years ago, the distributors did attempt to market it to those audiences-who are now angry about being misled although I think the trailer gives a pretty accurate representation of the film.So don't let the negative reviews and comments discourage anyone in the target audience from seeing this film. There are plenty of positive reviews and comments from critics who have a clue about Rodriguez's intentions and from the viewers in his target audience. There will be a lot of Sharkboys and Lavagirls out trick or treating this year and the film will become a classic to those who first see it at a young age.Which is not to say that only those in its target audience will  enjoy the film, it is a fun children's tale that might be described as a cross between "The Wizard of Oz" and "Yellow Submarine". In one respect it is better because almost all the actors are kids; Rodriguez understands that a lot of adult characters in a children's film is a less than zero situation. And it has very good messages: emphasizing the value of dreams, how dreaming better (i.e. unselfishly) increases that value, and how working to make your dreams come true maximizes that value (the young hero's name is "Max"). Plus Sharkboy and Lavagirl are friends who demonstrate a willingness to risk their lives to save each other. It is entertaining just to watch kids (both girls and boys) get into it.Speaking of less than zero, the advantage of seeing this on DVD versus in a theater is having the option to watch in 2-D. The 3-D version subtracts instead of adding, as much of the brightness and life of the film are lost to the crude 3-D cardboard glasses process they used. The only useful thing about the 3-D (other than a mildly interesting visual effect for those who have never experienced it) is the interactive aspect; as signs flash on the screen telling when to put on and take off the polarizing glasses. The DVD contains both versions and the 2-D one is first rate.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

until Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson) arrives to be the housekeeper
Although there is no overt sexual tension, they grow to love one another

In best British style, the emotions are suppressed for decades.Kazuo Ishiguro, a Brit with Japanese ancestory, acutely observed the British psyche in the novel

But Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's script for Merchant-Ivory is a rare case where the movie is better than the underlying book
She uses the technique of the epistolary novel (telling a story by letters between two people) and the carefully nuanced voice-overs by Hopkins and Thompson move the complex plot right along.If you can only picture "Sir Tony" as Hannibal Lecter, you'll be convinced that he is a great actor by this performance in which he ages several decades


Emma Thompson responds with heavily banked fires.When Hopkins begins a speech, "I must say this, because we may never meet again," you'll feel the tears running down your cheeks
This is a movie to watch time and again.

$review_text.: Spielberg's MUNICH is a brilliantly made movie, with superb direction, cinematography, acting and music...but it is not a pleasant movie to watch.  Inspired in part by true events that occurred after the tragic terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich olympics, the movie offers the difficult question of just when does revenge become simply murder?  As in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, Spielberg has some deeply disturbing and realistic scenes that are uncomfortable to watch in the sanctity of your home.  But the film is powerful indeed.  Eric Bana is marvelous in the role of Avner, giving us an honest portrait of a man who questions his ethics; Geoffrey Rush is great as his deceptive boss; and the underappreciated Ciaran Hinds glows in his role as the team's "worrier."  Surprisingly, future James Bond Daniel Craig's role is the least developed, but he does an okay job. John Williams does one of his best scores, and the movie is certainly a cinematic achievement, if not totally an entertaining one.

$review_text.: TAKERS is a very entertaining "cops-and-robbers" movie, enhanced with several well-executed action sequences that depend on stunts, rather than CGI.Idris Elba, Paul Walker, Michael Ealy, Hayden Christenson and Chris Brown make up a gang of Los Angeles bank robbers who have been able to pull off some remarkable, big money heists without being caught.  Their luck takes a downward turn when a former associate (Tip "T.I." Harris) approaches them with a fantastic deal involving enough cash that the gang will be able to retire.  Now, aside from the cops (headed by Matt Dillon and Jay Hernandez) close on their trail, the gang also has to deal with the Russian Mob and a major double-cross by one of their own.Directed by John Luessenhop, the film is cut from the same cloth as Michael Mann's HEAT (1995) in that it takes the audience into the personal lives of the criminals, humanizing them to the point where we almost wish that they will get away with their crimes.The screenplay by Peter Allen, Gabriel Casseus, Avery Duff and Luessenhop contains several surprising plot twists, but also more than one lapse in logic.  For example, in an opening sequence, the gangs robs a Federal bank, which had me wondering throughout the movie, why the LAPD was taking the lead in the investigation, rather than the FBI, which never even makes an appearance in the picture.However, the exciting action scenes, including the spectacular heist on the streets of downtown Los Angeles and a later shootout at Hollywood's Roosevelt Hotel, certainly take you mind off the minor failings of this likable "popcorn" movie that is what it is.On the other hand, I sort of felt sorry for the hotel maid at the Roosevelt who was going to have to clean the rooms at the Roosevelt after the gang had finished with them.:-)The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment contains audio commentary by the producers and director, plus a music video.

$REVIEW.: While most Japanese monster movies from the 1960s are loads of fun, this one is in a creepy class by itself. The horror isn't in the obvious mushroom monsters, but in the peeling back of civilization as the shipwrecked characters encounter the real monsters -- their own dark selves, stripped down to the primal core. The allegory is never overbearing, but the cast is clearly a microcosm of then-contemporary Japan, and by extension the modern, post-nuclear world. Beneath the glossy, fast-paced surface of the technological cityscape, irrational forces still fester, ravenous & unrelenting.The film itself looks terrific, drenched in rich color & mood. Rather than rely on gore & easy shocks, it builds atmosphere & dread as the casual veneer of each character begins to disintegrate. And exactly what are those mushroom people, anyway? Symbols of those who have abandoned reason & responsibility in favor of self-absorbed hedonism? The true face of the alienated public, which is concealed beneath flash & pop culture? The desire to hide from & deny the looming terrors of the world? Perhaps all that & more.As usual, Media Blasters has done a superb job of restoration & providing all the extras you could want. The commentary by lead actor Akira Kubo is informative & charming, and the additional special features are a treat. In its own way, as profound & challenging as the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," this is not to be missed -- most highly recommended!

$REVIEW.: Partway through this movie I was tempted to stop it, but I'm glad I didn't. This is a movie that starts good, has a wandering middle section, but a strong, satisfying finish. The story is one most people can relate to - a guy gets dumped, tries to forget his ex but can't get away from her, and manages to find someone else. The part where I almost gave up on it was around where Jason Segel's character was breaking down in scenes which were intended to be funny, but at times just felt sad. I enjoy comedies which include their share of drama, but these scenes felt too forced. It seemed like some of those scenes stretched on for too long or borderline-funny gags were repeated too much. The movie does still have its share of funny scenes, like most of Apatow's films.The scenes with the Dracula puppet musical were quite funny and the ending was rather touching. I will also give the movie credit for being one of the few daring enough to include male frontal nudity. Movies have no problem with having all the violence in the world but shy away from any nudity except graphic sex scenes. Here's an example of where nudity can be used in a story without being gratuitous.

$REVIEW.: I watched this on DVD yesterday and wasn't impressed

The plot is taken from movies such as Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds: Misfits overcome adversity to prevail
The comedy is funny, but not that funny

The most intriguing character is Vince Vaughn's: the party boy and instigator of all the craziness who is carrying around his son the whole time being a dad


Other than that, a lot of the movie is a let down


What's the point of that one fat guy doing the vault with the scrawny guy spotting him? He does the vault successfully with no squashing the little guy


Big whoop

That pretty much summarizes the movie


Lots of build up with no payoff.

I'll admit though, this isn't for people who've never exercised before. It's super hard, but worth it. I've already noticed a difference in my endurance after doing this dvd only five times in the past two weeks.

$REVIEW.: I have always been a huge fan of this show. Of course we all watch it because of the lead actor in it. His character is very abrasive and abusive to his coworkers , but they love him and they know he's a good man.  This season was 8 eps long and we get it on standard dvd here. It was shown in hd in the uk. WHy we can't get more uk shows on American tv is beyond me.  It's a good way for a network to get good programing and fill in gaps when other shows are not on.  Still this one is now gone , so it's a moot point. this one is from 2009. And we get a return of the evil mastermind serial killer , who is a female no less; and quite a good villain. One of the eps was weak in my opinion. And it is probably the weakest in the history of the show. It's about body parts selling.  But it's still a good ep; as this show never made a bad ep imo it is just weak for this great show.. Still for some it may leave a bad taste in their mouth because of the ending.  THe rest of the show are typical two parters and fit into the waking the dead mode.  There's one more series left to come out on this hit show which could have lasted more years , but tt's network cancelled it due to their desire to put new shows on. regardless of the fact that this was a hit for 11 years. (two of which had no shows on though).  On dvd looks as good as tit can in spite of the fact it was shot in hd.  There are NO extras , but for many of these tv shows from the uk , that's normal. At least we get to see them finally.
$SUMMARY.: one series left to go , this was a show still making great tv.

$REVIEW.: Now 5 years old, and released around the time when Earth destruction seemed to be the winning formula at the box office. This Sfx out the wazoo epic has none of the flare, drama, or intellect that other offerings had around at that time (closest comparison being Deep Impact), and my only real complaint would be, that it thinks it did.Here's the story - A huge Meteor is heading for Earth, and we're all about to die. Good news is that, after scouring the 5 Billion inhabitants on this planet, we managed to find a bunch of Oil Rig workers, who are the ONLY ones, able to save us.Bruce Willis is at his best (and worst) as Iron Jawed team leader, who must land on the meteor, dig a hole, and plant some explosives. His fellow workers (all with colorful backgrounds) will be able to go from beer drinking party animal roughnecks, to fully trained and specialised astronauts in about 6 weeks, and then try and pull off this amazing feat before we all get roasted. Sounds great, and actually it is a lot of fun - just make sure you leave the grey matter behind on this one and accept it for what it is...

It gets messed up and one of these rabbits {named Hutch} mutates and gets bigger, but this has also somehow affected Wallace.

$REVIEW.: This movie starts of great
A mad doctor conducting horrible experiments in an insane asylum, the inmates riot and nearly everyone is killed in a terrible fire

And then we move to the present day with Geoffrey Rush  playing an impressario with just the best roller coaster ride arranging a  party for his neglected wife (Famke Janssen).Unfortunately the story  goes down hill after that

The guests at the party are not those actually  invited but the decendents of the people who survived the fire, invited so  that the evil residing in the house can wreak its revenge

You get lots of  spooky opportunities, minor chords, jiggling and monstrous faces a la  Jacob's Ladder and lots of blood.But none of this is new and although  you may jump a few times, it is not really scary
The effects are not  really state of the art and evil is far too easily defeated (or at least  managed).The best scenes (available on the DVD) seemed to have been cut  from the movie

I have given this three stars because the DVD interface is  very well done and there are some nice extras.If you want to be scared,  watch the original


If you want a laugh with your mates over a beer or two,  this is for you.

Cher eclipses even Cleopatra and Nefertiti of their astounding imprints on history - you are totally captivated! EVERY major hit single, including 4  #1's in her native USA, are all songs nobody but CHER could have ever turned into the monumental hits she has produced...and rarily has anyone ever dared to "remake" a CHER song she so brilliantly defined in her own unique style. Not even Madonna could ever match the POWER and ENDURANCE of CHER's FIVE DECADE outstanding long career! Madonna may have more #1 singles, but, she has none of the artistic depth nor the stylistic vocal ability and no Academy Award to her credit. CHER is the quintessential female entertainer of all time in moderm pop music. FAREWELL TOUR dvd is total proof that people will continue to demand to see MORE of CHER in years to come, and a priceless concert show which belongs in every dvd-cd collection.

$REVIEW.: Finally, a modern day horror film with a touch of class


"The Wolfman" is set in the old country, 1891, perfect for a remake of the 1941 Lon Chaney classic

The film is loaded with suspenseful action and bloody gore, not recommended for the younger set


Sir Anthony Hopkins is in his usual psychotic role, Benicio Del Toro gives an adequate performance as Lawrence Talbot, Emily Blunt is the part of Gwen
The film is by no means perfect, a step higher than your run of the mill horror films of today - one flaw in the gypsy scene, the wolf is attacking the village running around killing, slicing, innocent victims one by one, the creature is moving at a velocity of a hundred miles an hour, as the camera zooms in, this thing is the size of a medium size dog, not big enough to be a "wolf man", obviously some bad camera work and effects


This and some overdone "howling at the moon" were basically the only flaws from this viewer
The plot is  different from the original, at the same time this new version is based on the same concept


"The Wolfman" is close to a newborn classic at least of the horror genre

The problem with remakes is you can't change or touch the original classics
The theater version runs 96 minutes, the unrated director's cut is 119 minutes, special features include deleted and extented scenes.

I know this was a fantasy movie and you have to let reality slip a little, but moving one of the world's most recognized landmarks, (presumably to avoid views of the World Trade Center site) is kind of lame.Oh yeah - the movie itself blew chunks.

$review_text.: This is the best version of "Ivanhoe" to be dramatized, and its not because it is completely true to the novel (although its close enough).  This version is great because it contains the slight adaptations to the story of "Ivanhoe" that everyone has wanted to see: Ivanhoe himself not so anti-Semitic as to deny his tenderness towards Rebecca, a generous Isaac of York, Brian de Bois Guilbert truly carried away by his love for the beautiful healer, and other subtle changes.  In addition it has all of the colorful pageantry, fast-paced action, sword-fights, jousts, and battles that will get your adrenaline pumping.  Sam Neill is superb as Guilbert, selfish, creepy, handsome and yet redeemed in the end.  (Note: there are some DVD versions of this movie floating around, but you'll have to look hard for them.)

$REVIEW.: I was a bit disappointed with this series.  Yes, the locations were great, South Africa is a dead ringer for Iraq, and the special effects were brilliant...BUT, I felt that there wasn't enough action.  Very few battle sequences, and those that there were, were too short.  The series spent way too much time with the internal politics of the military chain of command and how individual soldiers dealt with it.  I realize that the series was based on the writings and henceforth the book of the embedded Rolling Stone reporter that was featured in the series, but I must say that the fictional FX series "Over There" was much more exciting.That said, the portrayal of the first few weeks of the Iraq invasion was great.  From the MOP levels and the chaos in Baghdad after liberation was great.  So with that I give the series two stars, one for the location shooting, and one for the special effects.  I'd love to it it more stars, but quite frankly I would closely watch the show just waiting for something to happen, and then nothing ever did.If HBO, or whoever wanted to make a much more exciting show about the invasion, they should have used 3rd I.D. stuff, instead of a Marine Force Recon unit that *sighe* never got to do any force recon, other than once during the Nasiriyah sequence.

$REVIEW.: I am not familiar with the comic strip at all but my boyfriend pushed to see this film. Since I am a huge Steve Buscemi fan I agreed. I crossed my fingers hoping that this was not going to be your ususal teenager coming of age film and in that respect it most certainly was not.Initially, I was very intrigued by the main caharacter Enid (Thora Birch) who is a typical jaded, cynical teenager who's only motivation is to get the hell out of high school and get on with her life. The only problem is, what to do exactly. Enid is a complicated character who is on the outside of typical high-school society wearing thrift-shop clothing, sketching in her journal and has a penchant for East Indian 60's flims with rock music dance scenes (much like what you find on cable in the wee hours of Sunday mornings). She and her friend constantly observe stranger's foibles and often poke fun at them, even at the expense of the other persons feelings. Enter Steve Buscemi (Seymour)....Overall the performances were very good as well as the basic story line. I just was left wanting a little bit more.

$REVIEW.: Arising from Hollywood Babylon, from the depths of evocative cinematic arcana, here we remember Edward D


Wood Jr., one of the most underrated actors, producers, directors of all time
Driven by an insatiable passion for pictures, he brought his imaginative visions unto the silver screen with all the resources he had available, using wile and guile, remaining the nucleus of his own creations no matter what obstacles beset him

Wood {here portrayed by Johnny Depp} struggles for recognition and gathers around him a cadre of misfits from the crew to the actors themselves:Bela Lugosi: He meets with the legendary Bela Lugosi upon a fortuitous outing near a coffin shoppe, they quickly become friends, and remains Wood's primary star

Herein, he is portrayed as a pathos-inducing, flawed character surrounded in precious memories and the treasures of his career
Wood spends time with him watching Horror films and is regailed with tales of his experience.Vampira {Maila Nurmi; here nicely portrayed by Lisa Marie}: Meets her at a shindig literally begging her to appear in a movie, but is coldly denied
Until later when she is fired from her career as the nocturnal hostess of a horror movie show, finally agreeing to appear in a mute role for "Plan 9 From Outer Space"

Lugosi actually took quite a liking to her, even remarking on her ample cleavage.Tor Johnson {played by George "The Animal" Steele}: A brutish wrestler whom many will recognize as a bald zombie character immortalized in Halloween mask form.Lugosi {Martin Landau} became addicted to morphine which plagued him during this time, yet his love of films bade him on until he reaches a point of mandatory recuperation at a detox center, experiencing the horror of withdrawal, and where Wood meets his next wife after knitting Lugosi some black booties to "match his cape" - it was instant love after that
He eventually confesses his penchant at the local spookhouse for dressing in women's clothing, opting to get that out of the way before progressing with the relationship, and she accepts him nonetheless
His first wife became an ingrate and opted for a so-called "normal life".Prompted by a brief though motivating chat with Orson Welles, his most memorable accomplishment occurs after this departure, funded, by all things, two Christian ministers whom he convinced would in turn fund several religious films
Wood and crew actually become 'baptized' to ensure this cooperation

One of the most humorous lines in the film consists of his friend 'Bunny Breckinridge' {Bill Murray} who said "How do you do it? How do you get all your friends to get baptized just so you can make a monster movie?"The black and white format really manages to place one in Noir Hollywood, enhancng the overall storyline in certain classic style


Ed Wood essentially became the forefather of the B-Movie, whose comic science-fiction and horror presentations became an archetypal model for many similar creations to come.

$review_text.: This film is a great suspenseful thriller with a decent enough cast to be more than interesting, but it is also superfluous and irritating at times.The story is a real twister and will keep you guessing until the very end

Murders are being committed in Montreal and a team of experts sets out to solve them

As a viewer you are left guessing, then suspecting, and then guessing again


The actors are well cast and appealing in their individual roles with each contributing something worthy to the film
The three French detectives, played by Olivier Martinez, Tcheky Karyo and Jean-Hugues Anglade, are all great in their nose-to-the-grindstone tenacity
Martinez stands out as the sexy mysterious one that stirs a few questions

Kiefer Sutherland appears in an eerie way sending all sorts of messages to your senses and always playing such a part perfectly natural

Ethan Hawke is a witness who seems legitimate but also has an edge to his realm
Gena Rowlands is excellent as a worried mother who believes her evil son may have been the killer of so many young men


So the plot is set get ready for the ride.Of course the star of this movie is Angelina Jolie, a woman who is either amazingly lovely or downright irritating in her roles

Jolie begins this film as an incredibly strong and independent FBI agent/profiler who is appointed to help the Canadian detectives solve the murder mysteries at hand

She is great in the beginning of this film exhibiting a toughness that she sometimes lacks despite the attempt


Jolie is distant and constantly thinking, placing herself in the killer's shoes and attempting to master his/her thoughts

So what happens half-way through this film? Jolie suddenly becomes a stupid inane idiot, falling for someone who has danger signs written all over him, simply because she is lonely


She lowers herself to an entirely gratuitous sex scene and spends all of her close ups concentrating on how enormous her lips are and how much waterproof mascara she can wear
Needless to say I wasn't shocked to find out the director of this film was a man! Jolie's role goes from strength and wisdom to barefoot and pregnant and her integrity almost goes down the drain too


But thankfully with an ending twist she is revived to some degree as the woman she started out to be

Enough with the close-ups we all know she has lips, let her act already.For thriller and murder mystery fans this movie is a perfect treat

For lovers of gore and slasher films this movie contains enough to wet your whistle


Sadly even lovers of Jolie get more than they ever bargained for, much to her disgrace

The director does an excellent job at adding some scare tactics that will leave you jumping as well as a few chase scenes filled with excitement

Overall this film is pretty good but it could have been better if treated with a bit more care and respect for Jolie who ended up taking a few punches along the way.

Why not a Region 1 version? Chamberlain did three wonderful Dumas classics, this "The Count of Monte Cristo", and "The Three Musketeers". The first two are not available on Region 1 DVDs after all these years. Great movie that I highly recommend for the whole family. Let's hope someone like Criterion gets the rights for both Chamberlain's Dumas movies that aren't available and does a proper job of releasing them.

$review_text.: Visuals, visuals, visuals, baby!  That's all I can say.  I immensely enjoyed this futuristic action/drama about how the effects of a technology-driven society can lead to the decline of basic human need.  Out to prove otherwise, Will Smith did a good job in his role as detective Del Spooner.  He maintained his humorous roots, but also let us sample a slice of his more serious and dark side.  That being said, I've seen him do better.  The script could have been juiced up a bit as well; some scenes were pretty predictable.  Graphically speaking, there aren't many other action movies out there that can compare.It is a thrill ride indeed and I highly recommend its introduction to your ever-growing DVD collection.  Hint: Get the widescreen edition if at all possible.  Enjoy!WILDFLOWER has spoken! (Smile just a little :-})

$review_text.: The film &quot;Dave&quot; went through a script change. The story of a Presidential look-alike (Kevin Kline) who fills in for the secretly deceased real thing, the original story featured a Republican who brought his skills as a small entrepreneur to the job. Hollywood turned him into a Democrat, but kept his G.O.P common sense, such as when he and his partner look at the Federal budget and balance it by using the methods any small businessman would use. Naturally, pet liberal projects are all interjected while &quot;Republican priorities&quot; are given the heave-ho. You can search far and wide, and you will not find Hollywood films that openly portray a Democrat as the bad guy. I wrote a screenplay a few years ago called &quot;A Murderous Campaign&quot;. It had all the elements of a great script. A beautiful porn star has an affair with a Democrat Louisiana Senator. She overhears him plotting the assassination of a political rival, but they find out she heard the plan. They try to kill her, so she goes into hiding and hooks up with a crusty old Washington reporter who is considered kooky because he has been accusing this Democrat of these crimes for years. A retired FBI friend of the reporter helps them. The Democrat announces a Presidential bid. The porn star uses her considerable charms and discovers that the Governor of New Jersey is the assassination target at a Statue of Liberty rally. She saves the Governor, and the plot is revealed, but the Democrat candidate goes into spin control. Nobody can really prove the plan. It looks like he will win the nomination, having weathered the politics of personal destruction. Finally, the porn girl and the reporter find the old father of the Democrat's chief of staff, a former Ku Klux Klansman who wants to get what he knows off his chest before passing from this mortal coil. He tells them about the drug smuggling operation the candidate has been running in the Louisiana Bayou. The reporter's FBI pal arranges a raid. They discover all the &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence of a series of political murders going back years. The girl is re-united with her family, gets out of the porn business, the reporter wins the Pulitzer, and it is jail time for the Democrat. The end.Creative execs who loved the verbal pitch when I simply described the Democrat as a &quot;politician,&quot; a &quot;candidate&quot; or the &quot;Senator&quot; all passed when they read the part in the script that identifies him as an actual Democrat. Pamela Anderson would be perfect as the porn chick. I could see Denzel Washington as the reporter, and Gary Busey as the Democrat Senator. I was asked if I would change him to a Republican. My answer was that I wanted to maintain the realism of the story. See ya.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;STWRITES@AOL.COM

$review_text.: I tend to like tragedies and smoldering melodrama and this film has it in spades. Character motivations and actions are puzzling at times, mostly by editing and story telling trajectory. The time that passes is not always easy to gauge. The movie is quiet and slow, but complex. There was something here for me. If you find the plot synopsis of this film interesting and you can handle melancholy and drama, this is for you.I wouldn't find life lessons here. I took from this an interesting story of paths crossing. One in evolution the other devolution. Those lines zig-zag their way along towards avoidable yet irreconcilable courses. I loved Guillaume Gouix as Imir and found the actor's performance complex and the character charming yet tragically flawed. Matila Malliarakis is fine as Paulo, who is a lost needy soul, Dependent on others, his evolution is colored by the bird whose wing he takes comfort from.

$review_text.: I was 10 when I watched this as it aired originally and it was mesmerizing! Falconetti-William Smith- was possibly the BEST villian ever on film, big screen or tv! Considering this era - the 70s, left us with disco and music variety shows, it is almost impossible to believe the quality of Rich Man Poor Man! The acting is overwhelming, the story enthralling, and there is little "down time" in the series.

$REVIEW.: This isn't the same movie as the original, and that's a good thing. The original was all right for a cold war cautionary tale but it wasn't great science fiction. To my ears, the original sounded preachy and Klaatu seemed too much like a charming man rather than an alien. The new movie is a variation on the original rather than a remake. (Why do a remake? Just watch the original if that's the story you want to see.) The new version's plot fit together well and raised important issues about humanity's place in the ecosystem. That might offend those who take the view that humanity simply has dominion over everything else by virtue of ability or divine right, but it's a serious issue. By focusing on this issue, the new movie is far more relevant going forward than the old one. The new movie conveys more of the story through action rather than speeches and Keanu Reeves does a great job conveying the impression of an alien mind trying to interact with us. PS: Some folks have expressed anger at the film's portrayal of the US government as being run by warmongering idiots. (Remember the Iraq war, which was necessary to start due to the fictional weapons of mass destruction?) You have to remember this movie was made during the George W. Bush years. The portrayal looks accurate for that time frame. It's possible this aspect of the film will eventually seem dated if we're lucky enough to experience more responsible leadership in the future.

$REVIEW.: Ronnie James gives a stellar performance on both of the early shows on this DVD.  2 concerts are featured.  One from the Holy Diver tour and one from 1984's "Last in Line" album.The earlier show is from the last leg of the Holy Diver tour during the month of December.  This is a great piece of Dio history.  Plain and simple.  With this being an early show, the material is limited but the music is great.  Mostly tunes from the Holy Diver album along with some Dio era Black Sabbath.  Great versions of these songs are here.  Vinnie Appice's drums are phenomanally heavy and give the whole Dio expierence a different sound.Next is footage from the Last in Line Tour at the Philly Spectrum.  In my humble opinion this show contains the best version of "The Last in Line" I've ever heard.  Also, when the tune "Heaven and Hell" rears it's head during this show you are in for another great version of a great song.This is a solid DVD from one of the godfathers of heavy metal.  Truly, Ronnie James Dio is one of the driving forces behind metal and this DVD shows why.

$REVIEW.: Recently wrapping up of very enjoyable October month of nothing but horror we decided to get back into another foundation; glorious b action. What better way to start the evening off then with a double feature opening with the transcendentDeath Ring? Absolutely nothing is exactly right. Naturally the only way to close it out would have to be with the legendary Steven "Panda Bear" Seagal. Now you may be wondering how we got our hands on The Keeper before it's release date. Well Sid and the old boy Seagal go way back and always get a pre-screen run before the masses get their hands on it's action packed goodness. Coming off some recent "less then desirable" features, The Keeper proved to be somewhat of a throwback to vintage Seagal. Sure he's still quite portly but smart as a whip and really picked up the a** kicking factor that he's famous for.This round we start with Seagal playing the usual rogue LA cop character named Rolland Sallinger. He along with his partner bust up a drug ring taking 2 of their members out with some sweet gun action. As Rolland gets ready to call it in his partner winds up shooting him since they couldn't come to terms on stealing the cool 2 mil sitting in front of them. Naturally Seagal plays by the books and winds up shot and retired because of it. He was a good man. Being newly retired doesn't keep him down for long when he gets a call from an old pal with a problem. He brings Seagal in as a high payed bodyguard to is daughter, which of course proves to be the best move. The rest is filled with some very entertaining beat downs, great laughs, and an actual audible dialogue from the 99% of the time whispering Seagal.The Keeper had a bit of a "Man on Fire" feel just way more b and with much much less emotion. This was a happy day for Sid seeing a glimmer in the chances of Seagal's career getting back on track. Ok, lets not get nuts here. No it won't get him back in the mainstream but should impress his group of followers out there. He's not and will probably never return to his former notoriety except among the action b loving community who will continue to watch his monthly features. At this point you can't expect too much and have to realize as long as their laughs to be had, then Steven Seagal is your man. From all angles this one was gold for us and has us awaiting the next release.

$REVIEW.: Reviewer John Corbett wrote the definitive review of this product, so all I want to do is add my voice to those who appreciate this great stroll down memory lane and hope that additional seasons of TWIB will be made available.I had spent the eight years prior to 1977 overseas (Army brat) and just about the only way to follow baseball at all was to buy baseball cards during the brief time that they were available at the Post Exchange each year


The 1977 season was the first season that I was truly able to follow baseball: I watched the NBC game of the week every week (loved doubleheader days), listened to every game of the 1977 Texas Rangers (their best team until 1996), and never missed This Week In Baseball
Watching these old TWIB episodes is like seeing those old baseball cards come to life and reliving part of my childhood.Due to my limited access and knowledge of MLB prior to that time, I didn't know that Mel Allen wasn't just the narrator of TWIB

For anyone who wants to hear him as a game annoncer for the Yankees, pick up a copy of the DVD of 1960's World Series Game 7 - legendary Pirates announcer Bob Prince handles the early innings and Mel Allen announces the rest

It's one of the greatest games of all-time with the game's most memorable homerun (sorry, Bobby Thomson) and two great announcers.As far as the quality of the DVD's is concerned, I had no trouble with them whatsoever - they even played perfectly on my oldest (12 years old) DVD player.

$review_text.: I chose two stars just to be different.  One for Ego, one for Mego.I thought I was a Neil Young fan but I guess not. I've been waiting, hoping, for a box set from him, but more like a human-scale box set, 4 to 6 cds and a nice book.  So we go from Decade to this?  I got the complete Thelonious Monk on Riverside for half this and that was 15 cds from the greatest period of one of the 20th century's most important jazz artists.  I got the Grammy winning Charlie Patton box with  7 or 8 cds and a hardcover book and amazing packaging for less than half this.  I think you can get the complete Jesus and Mohammed debates for 200 (sarcasm).I have always respected Neil; he stays real and continues to create, but this sure smells like Ego to me.  Too bad.  After all this wait I now know there will never be a simple human-scaled box set of Neil Young.  Big deal about the audiophile sound quality issues.  I'd have to jump through technological hoops just to hear this music on half my cd players.  What the heck is goin' on up there on Sugar Mountain?

I waited a whole year to watch the second season
BBC America showed last season and this season out of order, so I sat down one day and watched episodes 1 to 8


I plan to watch episodes 9, 10 and the deleted scenes real soon

I am now even more hooked than ever


I am waiting for Season 2 in region 1 NTSC format and I hope they make a Season 3, 4, etc

You can not compare this to Buffy because it is very different story

The only similarity is that they are both about the supernatural
I liked the Buffy series, but this series is better than Buffy, Angel, or Xena

Hooray for the British


Thelma is my favorite character because she is quirky.

 I think the best thing about "Planet Earth" is that it is great for all ages


 My wife and I are in our mid-20s, both of our parents loved the series, and I know kids are more than able to appreciate the material
 I'm very excited about holding onto this series for my children; I know they'll love it.For those in the U.S., many reviewers have pointed out that the narration is different than that which was broadcasted on TV

 I can't really attest to which is better because I first watched this series on DVD


 However, I feel that Attenborough does a great job of conveying his high level of interest in his subjects and really makes you wonder at what you're seeing.I'd also like to comment on the environmentalism of the series

 Environmentalism is a hot issue these days, and while I'm not a big environmentalist in the way that most people use that term, I am concerned about the environment generally

 I think this series strikes a good balance by bringing to mind the relevant issues without driving the point home to an offensive extent.All told this is a great accomplishment
 The thousands of hours in the field clearly paid off; some of the shots the camera crews captures are hard to believe


 Further, the insight into "nature's ways" makes one marvel at creation
 You can't go wrong...

If you had a "Choice Of Colors"Which one would you choose my brothers? If there were no day  or night,which would prefer to be right? But it goes beyond his years with theImpressions, into his solo career. His thoughts about leavingthe Impressions. I was born in 1955 with Cerebral Palsyand I'm Black American. So when Curtis sang"We're A "Winner"We're a winner and don't let anybody sayyou can't make it because a feeble mindis your way.No more tears do we cryand we have finally dried our eyes."Curtis was talking to ME.All of Curtis' songs we're one on one.From "He'll Break Your Heart"Which he gave to Jerry Butler to his solo careerthat began with "If There's A Hell Below"it's here on this DVD.Along with priceless interviews with formerU.N. ambassador Andrew Young about the messagein the music and Carlos Santana who explainshow Curtis crossed boundaries.There are interviews with his wife and evenCurtis himself before his tragic accident.The interviews were done separately.He was as important to me as my self esteem.He put The Lord and Black Pride together,as no one ever had before,or, since.The most surprising thingabout Curtis' is how many songs he wrote for other singers."He'll Break Your Heart" for Jerry Butler became "He Don't Love You"for Tony Orlando.  He was producer, arranger, songwriter and singer,who met obstacles but kept Movin Ob Up and may inspire you to dothe same.

$REVIEW.: This film has become a classic for combat realism & intensity. It's definitely not for the faint-hearted, especially the first 25-30 minutes.For many years I considered THE LONGEST DAY, the best film about the Normandy invasion during WWII.  That was an excellent film for its time, but this Spielberg production takes the invasion & ensuing days to a much more intense, gut-wrenching level, with a story that not only is based in fact but also shows the horrors of combat in a way that few films ever have.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN develops the characters in such a way that any harm that befalls them has a greater impact on the audience than most war films.There are a number of breakout performances by this star-studded cast (Sizemore, Diesel, Pepper, Davies, Goldberg, Ribisi) with some fine "cameos" by Giamatti, Ted Danson, Dale Dye, and Dennis Farina, to mention some of the more better known actors.  Tom Hanks EARNED his Oscar for best actor.  His performance as Captain John Miller was BETTER THAN "spot on"; it was masterful.While other excellent war films have been made since this one was released in '98, such as BLACKHAWK DOWN & the HBO series BAND OF BROTHERS, this one will rank at the top of anyone's list of gripping war stories for years to come.The extras in this set are top notch as well.  You can't go wrong with this DVD version unless you get the Blu-Ray release.

 I sure hope that Eisler didn't write the screenplay and if he did that he was paid enough so that he can create a fund to reimburse those of us that purchased or rented this movie.Some salient factors:1.) I generally don't mind subtitles
 However, this was not billed as a foreign film?  The majority of the dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles, except for when Gary Oldman rants in American accent or the John Rain character speaks acceted English (was he not born and raised in the US?)2.) For all the points made by other review, the movie storyline did no service to written series
 The Bourne series is proof that both the books and movies can be entertainingFar be it from me to cast asperions on how anyone makes a living, however, Gary Oldman must have needed a check!

$review_text.: Freeway (1996), is an extraordinary, hyper-scary movie  that thinksnothing of  delving into taboo subjects, sordid fascinations that toooften are swept under the rug in our society... anarchy, juveniledelinquency, shootings, chaos of cities, etc. For that reason, perhaps this filmshould be rated not 17, or 21 but perhaps 30 or 35, suchis the graphic nature of the filming, the language, the underlying taboosubjects touched upon that only jaded, "men of the world" would hesitantlyadmit exists or discuss in today's society. e.g. drive by shootings,the constant need for the justice system to redress certain extreme behaviorsfrom extreme individuals, commercialism, etcThe filming is great, with its wide-screen format, although the music is veryminimal or invisible in the context of the underlying story.Reese Witherspoon's character is outstandingly played by the actress, as anagressive,  stressed out 17 year old raised in a broken home, (with all thatentails), and the vicious circle seems to repeat itself, despite herself,as she falls into the same pattern of life occurrences as everyone in her familydid in the past,  although she  sees it coming a mile away, from having beenaround the block a few times. Her charisma and youthful energy are a plus.Kiefer Sutherland's choice in volunteering for this picture, lends it credibilityas entertainment, but  ...the audience will be challenged and baffled for theactor not having minded to be portrayed as a psychologist who loveshis job of listening to the emotional despair of his clients during therapy,as the same time as he has immense  personal skeletons in the closet, 100 timesfold more serious than any of those he's counseling.Amanda Plummer, does a perfect job in the role of Reese's mother, which isof a methampetamine addict, doing tricks for cash, while  Dan Hedaya isfine as a  modest police detective just trying to get to the bottom ofthings.A winner of the Cognac Police Festival in France, the same year it wasreleased, Freeway has an impact which is  entertaining, but a lot moreas a  shocking experience to viewers, almost every 5 minutes, as almost everyaspect of personal behavior shown offers  no limits, no filters, norestraint.  It's a  certain "Reality" in America, which is absolutely real:the penal system, out of bounds behavior, the consequences, real casualtiesfrom youths who have access to Saturday Night Specials, etc.The upshot, is that this movie is a must-see, but jaws will drop to the ground overand over again, over 90 mins.

$review_text.: Writer / director Paul Greengrass presents a plausible imagining of events aboard the ill-fated United Flight 93, which went down in a grassy field after the passengers stormed the cockpit rather than allow the hijackers to pursue their objective unchallenged.  This story is interwoven with the events in various control rooms as air traffic controllers and military personnel gradually realize what is happening and find to their horror that they are unprepared to stop it.This film keeps a tight focus on the events of the day, thereby honoring the memories of the fallen by keeping our attention on their plight and their reaction to it, rather than making political points about the big picture.  There is no mention of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, Afghanistan, or Iraq.  The audience becomes observers at the various locations and learns nothing that the actual participants would not have known.  We learn nothing more of the passengers on United 93 than we would if we were fellow travelers on the same flight.  The result is far more powerful than if the filmmakers had strained for effect through trumped up sentimental backstories or political proselytizing.

$review_text.: I found this movie engrossing.Alexander Payne once again tells a story of everyday life and in a just under two hours lets the viewer consider a variety of emotions from different character's perspectives.Clooney was an interesting choice as the very emotionally distant father to his two daughters. To be honest, I think he was too extreme and bordered on non-believable. Perhaps his lack of experience as a father was difficult for him to grasp the sincere empathy that the role required.Shailene Woodley was tremendous for a 21 year old with little movie experience. She was able to bring the pain, hurt, rage and sense of loss all to the screen. I hope we see more of her.Hawaii as the backdrop to the movie was inspired. It's tranquility and beauty in complete contrast to the emotional drama being played out in the foreground. I quite liked how one reviewer suggested Hawaii was in fact another character in the movie.So some excellent acting, a script and plot that allows the viewer to "participate" in the emotions played out on screen, made this a very thoughtful and strong drama.

$REVIEW.: Peter(Christopher Walken), the cellist for the Fugue String Quartet, has been diagnosed with early stage Parkinson's Disease.  He tells the other members of the group his intentions to retire and he is already grooming a replacement.  This sets up a string of events within the quartet both professional and personal.  There has been a percolating resentment by Robert(Philip Seymour Hoffman), the second violinist, toward Daniel(Mark Ivanir), the first violinist.  Robert feels he and Daniel should alternate chairs as well as take more artistic chances.  Juliette(Catherine Keener), violist and wife of Robert, sits by in angry silence.  Outside the group Robert has a one night stand with a flamenco dancer which Juliette finds out about and throws him out.  Daniel meanwhile is developing a relationship with Alex(Imogen Poots), daughter of Robert and Juliette.  This may all sound a little melodramatic but it's not really.  The inner workings of the quartet mirror those of any group of people who've worked together a long time.  The cast is uniformly excellent but Walken is the glue that holds the film together.  While he's dealing with his illness as the sage elder and de facto leader of the group it is he who has to navigate the quartet through the rough waters.  I won't even pretend that I know much about classical music.  My attraction to the film was the presence of Walken.  I can correlate this film to the dissolution of pop groups like the Beatles who became undone when internal and external distractions caused them to go their separate ways.  That said this film is very accessible to classical music non-enthusiasts.

$REVIEW.: I guess that I realized it in the very beginning of the movie.  When Lance Henriksen is the star and there are no other recognizable names or faces, maybe that is a cue that you might want to see something else.  As a mystery, it does not work because what is going on becomes painfully clear pretty early in the movie.  I do not feel that it is fair to blame the actors, who incidentally do not distinguish themselves.  But, who could make something out of this simplistic yet muddled mess?  It would have been somewhat interesting if we could make some sense of each character's epiphanies, but they are so garbled and unclear that there is never any payoff.  And, on top of that, the ending (I shall not give it away) was contrived and trite.  An almost complete disappointment.

$review_text.: Not having seen this movie since the late 90s, I was certain that I had retained an accurate memory of it

But I was wrong
I had forgotten the pain we all endured {yes, I endured it along with the characters}But I thoroughly remembered the genius of the book, as well as its incredible transition to a movie!I was struck anew by the 'spot-on' casting, the horror of Celie's life, the unreasonable meanness of Mister


But I had forgotten the burden carried by Shug, the horrible misunderstanding between Sofia and Harpo, the unbearable bigotry they all lived through.And the music! What can I say about such genius in creating the 'lift- your-heart' music that, at times, left me gasping in delight?This two-disc special edition had none of the original defects, praise God, but rather a smooth and splendid retelling of a timeless and always germane, story
It is a credit to all who participated in the movie, in any way.And just as I felt the first time I saw it, I can only wonder why the Academy Awards members dared to give it NO Oscars, not even to Quincy Jones! Each actor in it gave superlative performances, if not the performance of their lives!I urge everyone to renew their acquaintance with "The Color Purple" once again, as such talents cannot be seen in today's films.

$REVIEW.: Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe&ntilde;a have a great chemistry in this movie and help to carry a fairly leaden script through the slower parts


They are easy to believe as good friends, partners and cop buddies and certainly the dialog lends itself to creating an authentic relationship between the two.Unfortunately, the amateur-cam filming style is distracting and unnecessary and not even consistent throughout

It's never explained why all these separate parties are carrying video cameras and in certain scenes they revert back to an unknown third party camera presumably because they couldn't figure out how to put a camera in the scene (who's filming Gyllenhaal and Kendrick's love scenes?)
All in all, it would have been a better film to shoot in a traditional way without having this distraction.The main plot is slow to start too

The first act is spent showing what great cops our duo are and while we get to witness some exciting action, when the bad guys decide to take them down, it all feels very rushed


As a result, the film is very strong on character and atmosphere but the plot's not well structured enough to act less like TV and more like a movie.Ultimately, End of Watch provides an exciting ride up to a point but after the film you don't feel you really discovered anything


It compares poorly with Training Day, David Ayer's earlier flick, which shows how well executed a detailed police procedural can be.

$REVIEW.: Too many foriegn war movies are not coming out here in region one on blu ray.This is playable though on our blu ray players , in fact of all the recent blu ray foriegn language  war themed blu ray releases only max manus is not compatible with our blu rays

 This movie is a great movie because it really shows how people can adapt to terrible situations that are beyond imagining

This is a absolutely true story true

By the time of the russian entry into berlin , the battle that killed hundreds of thousands of people; berlin was in ruins,  people stood in line for food, and if people were blown up they'd take their place in line covered with blood and guts, just to get something to eat

That's a desperate nightmare even before the russian troops entered the city

Most germans too knew that The axis troops had engaged in a orgy of death and rape and extermination on the eastern front and the russian troops were  out for revenge

However as this movie makes clear the average soldier usually wasn't there to exterminate the germans
They did rape every woman in site though including elderly women

There was random kilings though of people , but mostly it was rape and this movie shows that women were forced to survive those terrible days that many women had to adjust to this and try to find a russian soldier that they could have as a protector


After all after the fourth rape or much more it would be in your best interest to get someone to keep the others off you.Some women killed themselves , others went mad, but most just tried to survive and remained strong


They adjust and shockingly discuss their different rapes and how they were treated by different soldiers raping them in groups

 They must adapt and if they must sleep with the russians to get food so be it

The men sit around helpless why the women accept things as they are
This story came from a autobiographical  book that shocked and angered people in the late 1950's
Noone wanted to accept that women would just deal with the  horror of this and do the best they could to survive

The authors name is still not given even after her death


 But history is filled with women shacking up with former raping conquerers

It's about survival after all and war drags things down to primitive level


Noone who wasn't there in these situations can judge the women


This movie isn't a great movie like 'downfall' which you can get on blu ray too, but it's a good and important movie about the human condition

It has bloody fighting in the first part as the russains fight their way in and then begin to take their lustful revenge

Even so they are not depicted as mindless beasts but angry wartorn men who feel that true justice would be extermination

That being said the russian leadership did kill several million germans when they forced them out of what is now western poland.The deaths from the war continued long after the fighting stopped

In fact with many people deported throughout eastern europe to siberia only to die there over the next ten years the true death toll of the war is far greater than anyone wants to admit

 This blu ray looks great with a great print , it's in german with english subtitles and that's fine because reading is good for your brain
 The acting is very good and the story true and true stories that stick to the facts are the best kind

History isn't boring it's a slaughter really with times of peace inbetween.

$review_text.: THE SEVEN LITTLE FOYS (1955) is narrated by Foy boy #2, Charley, who sounds just like kid brother Eddie Jr
Accepting that this musical biopic is mostly fiction, its 93 minute running time would have greatly benefited by the addition of a single reel
Foy Sr.'s early song and dance routines are most interesting (as are his later on-stage struggles with the children)
Once Eddie (still a 'single') graduates from vaudeville to Broadway, career success and the passage of time are noted by the use of a series of lighted ad signs that proclaim his hit shows

An opportunity to present a song highlight from each is squandered here
To have done so would've added greatly to this film's depth and in hindsight, its value as a source of theatrical history.Jimmy Cagney appears briefly as George Cohan
In a testimonial dinner highlight, he mounts a long, shiny black table top and performs his famous "Yankee Doodle Boy" steps fromYANKEE DOODLE DANDY(1942)
Although 13 years older and clearly heavier, Cagney has lost only a little of that loose-jointed flexibility
Hope (as Eddie Foy) follows him and delivers a vigorously impressive tap routine

They conclude with a precision softshoe duet.In typical Hollywood fashion, all this frivolity unfolds while Foy, who's just returned to NY, is unaware that Madeleine (Milly Vitale), beloved wife and mother of his seven children, has died from a lengthy illness that she kept hidden from him.Angela Clarke is Aunt Clara, the deceased's meddling older sister who, incensed that they must play the Palace during Christmas week, tries to wrest the kids away from Eddie by getting the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children involved (this organization's actual name was the Gerry Society)


Foy has his brood do their pathetic stage specialties for the presiding judge and he rules that they aren't performers


Although defeated, Aunt Clara decides not to return to Italy and on one auspicious Sunday, Eddie actually makes it to church with the family! Bells all across New Rochelle announce the miraculous news


Finis.(Watch for a priestly cameo by Joe Flynn, best known as Capt


Binghamton on TV'sMCHALE'S NAVY.)

$REVIEW.: This is my favorite Kubrick film to watch because it is his most  &quot;extreme&quot;- in language, violence, and subject matter.What makes  this movie so much better than all other war movies is the fact that it  doesnt concentrate on one facet of war, such as a battle, man or mission.  It focuses on the complete process of dehumanization of men in war.From  drilling it into their heads in basic training, to &quot;pacifist&quot;  Joker wasting the sniper, and thus, completing the process.Kubrick really  seems to capture the essence of men in the Vietnam War. Commanders only  intent on creating killing machines, soldiers simply killing for amusement,  and no one thinking of the consequences for anyone. I've read a lot of  criticism of the second half of this movie-the battle scenes-for being  boring(compared to the first half) and unrealistic. I feel I must point out  that the first half is so savagely brutal that the revelation of the  meaning of life would probably  be a letdown. As for it being unrealistic,  Vietnam is not just one big jungle, and war is not made up simply of planes  flying overhead and bombs being dropped. These scenes, I feel, capture the  isolation and  sense of terror  in being in a situation in which you have  little or no control, and can be killed at any moment. I hope that those of  you who don't lile the second half will go back and rewatch it. It is  certainly worth the extra effort, for it is what makes the film a classic.

$review_text.: I gave it five stars for the touching performance by George C
Scott, reprising his role as General Patton.Alas, one can guess the source of this DVD
A VHS tape.I already owned the original Fox VHS tape, which I will continue to keep.Yet, in quality, both are equivalent, neither worse, nor better.The only minus lies in the fact that the DVD sports an evident superimposed logo on one corner of the image.But this is not disturbing, since it is halfway transparent.Yet they could have done without it.So, back to the contents of this made-for-TV movie.First of all, it comes in its original full content version, running slightly over three hours long.The acting is fair for this kind of movie.Names such as Murray Hamilton, Eva Marie Saint and Daniel Benzali (in one of his earliest appearances), giveyou an idea of the caliber of actors involved.As the title states, this is a more or less faithful account of the last days of Patton, involving him as theMilitary Governor of occupied Bavaria and his relations and conflicts with General Eisenhower, which encompassesthe first half of the movie, to the tragic car accident that caused him to break his neck and surviving it fora while (the second part of the movie).We are also introduced into some flashbacks on Patton's earlier military career and his struggles to transforma static Army, into a rolling and moving Force.We get to see some of his romantic life and finally, is ultimate battle with Death itself.He died a hero and consequent to what he believed in.It is a very touching and moving picture of a very controversial historic figure, but despite all his humanfrailties this big hulk of a man demonstrates that one can keep his dignity even to the end.He was a fighter, beloved and perhaps even hated by those who knew him personally, but at least he was one manwho helped move things along in a time where many were too scared to act.He was a leader, he was a war philosopher, a classic hero, like those he worshiped from Ancient History, andtherefore he may be considered sitting in the Pantheon of these peers of his.This movie is a worthy complement to "Patton".If only 20th Century-Fox would care to pick it up again, restore its original filmed material, digitalize itand transfer it cleanly on DVD, they would have the appreciation of many who did appreciate and love the workdone on the transfer of "Patton".Only time will tell, but I am sure, one day, someone may wake up and smell the coffee...In the meantime, I can recommend this as an interim to that next version.As said, it is not worse, nor better than its VHS counterpart, but being this a DVD, brings a more durable platformto it.To me it is a worthy investment, if just as a historic documentation...

$REVIEW.: Valentine ( Irene Jacob ), a Swiss model, runs over a dog and haps on the owner ( Jean-Louis Trintignant ), who is an old judge


Although the judge begins talking about his past, what he says also depicts Valentine's future
There's the linkage between his past and her destiny! On the other hand, Auguste ( Jean-Pierre Lorit ) is preparing for the exam to be a judge...Red implies passion, but also means fraternity
This motion picture depicts cyclical destiny and human spirit.Jacob, the star of "Double life of Veronique," is vivid in Kieslowski's movie

Trintignant expresses the old judge who is revived by Valentine well


Lorit's silent performance is notable.Director Kieslowski is good at depicting two things at the same time


In Red, he expresses the linkage between the past of the old judge and heroine's destiny
Kieslowski uses unique, artistic, and abstract expression


He effectively uses silence, unique behavior, metaphor, minimum speech, and beautiful music
In addition, he represents the characters of the hero and heroines of The Three Colors Trilogy ( Blue, White, Red )by contrasting the each reaction toward an old lady through three stories

Also, it is interesting that 3 stories are intertwined.The three colors trilogy consists of 3 films ( Blue, White, Red ) 
The colors of French flag means liberty, equality, fraternity

Director Kieslowski expressed these themes through the movies


Compared to "Blue" and "White," "Red" gives us the impression of the hopeful future


Also, this film was nominated for the Academy Award in 1994


Many viewers have praised this film
I recommend watching all three motion pictures.

$REVIEW.: How many bands have such a history that they can create a 8 hour documentary and have it fun and entertaining? Not many! Can you imagine a 8 hour film on Journey or REO Speedwagon? Not me.This film actually stems from a 1971 film Neil from Apple corp made called "The Long and Winding Road" and was placed on fold and was actually be end with a filmed re-union of the 4 Bealtes doing a few songs, but Lennon died and the film was on hold until 1994 when they decided to complete it.The only gripes...2 gripes out of 8 hours.....on some of the songs, one example is Revolution 9, the song jams to a pristine video clip....then they fade the song down and have John talk about how it came into being then the music comes back up. I'd rather have the song play out then have Johns audio talk about the song.Gripe #2 is the bonus features, there are 2 segments were the surviving 3 (Threatles) are playing songs, one is sitting on the ground by a stream and George has a ukilalie, they play 1 song, another section is the 3 are actually back in the studio doing an acoustic jam...I wish they just showed all that footage..or edit it down to shwoing all the songs and some chit-chat...I mean what a historic happening, the 3 surviving Beatles back and actually performing songs! It mighta been a but lack-luster, but just the historical context of that alone merits it worthiness........or maybe Apple will package it as a DVD someday.....make some bucks that way.The Anthology series flows and is never dull, you can watch the whole series then a week later go through it all again and have it seem just as fresh. It's a true work of art from hours and hours of hard work collection various news reels, interviews, tv clips, promos and hours of new interviews edited down to be inserted in the film. I really like the fact you don't see the wives and friends of the Beatles, but you see and hear the Beatles, Sir George Martin and staff of Apple, corp back then narrate this series, its a classic and is their coda.

$review_text.: Lately I have been trying to more coherently form my thoughts on why I didn't care for "Inglorious Basterds". Now that I think about it some more, it was a matter of inconsistency of tone and pointless violence.With "Inglorious Basterds", Tarentino didn't seem to know exactly what kind of movie he was making and he switched back and forth between styles with no rhyme or reason. I know people say that's his "style", but he has proven he can work within his "style" and still make a movie that works within its own universe if nowhere else. Here he jumped so randomly between Parisian/subtitled art house movie to exploitation flick to war drama with such quickness that the story lost all sense of flow and I was constantly being knocked out of the movie like a car crash. I have seen these three styles worked together before and to do it well you have to flow one into the other as a consequence of the story and not a jump cut that seem to exist only as a result of the director's inability to blend them together.As far as the violence goes I really don't mind gory, even gratuitous violence, as long as it serves the story and doesn't merely exist as a gag. For instance the difference between the Hitler skull destruction scene near the end when compared to a similar death in "Glory". In "Glory" a commander's head popped like a ripe zit during a close up and splattered everyone around him in dripping bits of brain matter and hair. Over, done, quick and pointed. It made its impact and moved on. In "Inglorious Basterds" the violence is such a distinct entity in the exploitation sections of the movie that it felt like Tarentino was sitting around with some buddies saying, "hey you know what'd be so super gross?!" and then he built a movie around it. It never felt like it served a plot or a direction for the story. Even "Hobo With A Shotgun" seemed to have a reason for most of the gratuitous violence it showed and there was a consistent tone to the film. That movie was messed up beyond all reason, but the film makers kept us firmly rooted in a world that made sense, at least to itself and it obeyed its own rules.If this had been a clips movie of short films and it were edited into distinct sections where one third was the straight narrative of the girl, one third was gory exploitation, and one third was the ending where they come together, all presented one right after the other instead of interspersed within one another I might have found a middle ground with the movie. As it was I just didn't enjoy it. Editing it differently may have provided us with a far better movie.

$review_text.: Yikes! I rented the movie because of the All-Star cast and the advertisement on television. Obviously this was an HBO series which I didn't see. If I had, I would just have been watching a repeat. But since I had never seen it and was expecting a full-length movie, I was deeply disappointed when the credits came up without a conclusion.Because the end was left dangling, I can't give it five stars. What happened to the characters? What happened to the relationships? What happened to the hopes and dreams some of the people had?Although the cast was superb, I also thought the story was VERRRRRY slow. I paused the DVD player a couple of times to do something else just to break the monotony. Cinematography was excellent and the story was refreshingly void of nudity and foul language, however, so that is the plus side of this DVD - along with a look at people in small-town America.Sorry, folks, the book or the whole series may have been good, but if Hollywood is going to put a story onto DVD, they should put the WHOLE story!Gail Gupton Author,The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth

$review_text.: &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; is a touching and nicely done film. It has a good story to it and it is greatly enjoyable. It is about a young boy who lives in a small town in Connecticut with his mother and his the events that take place when a man(Anthiny Hopkins) comes to stay in their house with them. There is much more to the story, but you have to go see it to find out what else. I greatly enjoyed this film. There have been so many awful films this year that it was nice to see a really good one for a change that I did not walk out of feeling any bit of disappointment for. I think Anthony Hopkins did a great job in this film and should definitely be recognized for it when oscar nominations are decided. Also, the young boy in the film is good too. It was really nice to see good acting by a young actor for a change, most child actors couldn't act to save their lives. I also really liked director Scott Hicks directing style. He makes some of the best looking films out there and he really uses his gift with this film. So if you read this review, take my advice and go see this film because it really is one of the better ones out there today.

$REVIEW.: It is true that in today's politcally correct world, there would be much hand wringing about this film
But, it is one of the funniest films of all time

Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder are a great comic team


And, the film itself is filled with so many wonderful moments
Harvey Korman and Madeline Kahn are fabulous

This movie showcases Mel Brooks as a director


Unlike some of his later films, he shows more restraint and doesn't try so hard to get the laugh
Yes, they use the "n-word." But, it this movie, in works


And, sometimes, we just take ourselves to darn seriously!

When a plea deal is struck that sets one of his family's killers free, he decides to take justice into his own hands
He targets not only the killer but also anyone else involved in striking the plea deal
This means many people will face the wrath of Clyde Shelton (okay, that's no &#34;Hannibal Lecter&#34; but boy, does he know how to out-think...plus he doesn't eat his kills.).If you haven't seen this movie or know how/who kills these people while Clyde is in isolation in prison, then it will be a very enjoyable  view
it does not hold up on repeated viewings because, well, like with magic, once you know how the trick is done, it is not so impressive.Nonetheless, it is an absolutely worthwhile watch.

$review_text.: I can't understand how anyone could give this movie more than one star.  I would give this movie NO STARS if I could...or maybe even a NEGATIVE star!This movie, in a word, stinks.  I can not think of one good thing to say about it.  Okay, maybe Mary Louise Parker.  She's always interesting, for some reason.  But that's about it!Where do I begin?  You all know the premise:  Ryan Reynold's, a good cop, ends up dead and working for the RIPD (Rest in Peace Department).  He is partnered up with Jeff Bridge's character; a gruff gun slinging lawman from the 1800's.Their mission is to find and kill &#34;deados&#34;...bad dead guys who are hiding out on earth to avoid &#34;judgment.&#34;Okay.  This movie is supposed to be a comedy, right?  Then....where were the laughs?  This movie was not funny.  It was not funny in the least.  Yes, it felt a little like Men in Black...but without any of MIB's charm, humor, cleverness....or good character development!Ryan Reynolds as the main character is soooo bland!  Bland, bland, bland!  Nothing likable there at all.  And Jeff Bridge's character?  Well, I just found him irritating.  He's like a one trick pony.....always bringing up the past, and living up to his tough old west gunslinger clich&eacute; of an image.The two partners have fake i.d.s that determine how others see them.....Ryan Reynolds becomes a little old Chinese man, whereas Jeff Bridges becomes this (supposedly) hot blonde.  The so-called humor of these fake i.d.s is so juvenile!  Unless you are under the age of 17, you probably won't find this ongoing joke very amusing.The &#34;deados&#34; in this movie also have zero charm.....at least the aliens in Men in Black and the ghosts in Ghostbusters were FUNNY!  These creatures are just flat out rubbery looking messes.Wow.  I hate to be so negative.  I wish I could think of something good to say.  Well, the best thing that comes from me watching this movie is the ability to warn you NOT to!

$REVIEW.: In the Wedding Date, Dermont Mulroney plays a male escort hired by Kat (the beautiful Debra Messing) to star as Kat's boyfriend at her half-sister's extravagant wedding.  Kat dreads going to the wedding and seeing her ex-boyfriend so she pretents she has a great guy and that her life is perfect.In reality, Kat is still in love with her ex and wants to show him how she had moved on, or win him back, either way would be fine with her.The plot is similar to Pretty Woman, with genders switched.  Except this movie glosses over Mulroney's career as a man-prostitute and what kind of services that entails.  This movie has funny moments and will be tolerable movie for a guy forced to watch it with his wife/girlfriend.  I haven't watched 5 minutes of Will and Grace so I enjoyed spending 78 minutes (this is a short movie) watching Debra Messing.This is a good, fun, sweet movie with charming cast that should be enjoyable to everyone, and good movie for guys to watch in hopes of getting your girl to watch the Wedding Crashers with you.

 And man, I thought Jack of All Trades was going all the way

 Not only is it entertaining and humorous, but educational as well


 What better way to teach kids about the history of early America than by showing Bruce Campbell as the Daring Dragoon as he foils evil plots against America?  Not everything is completely factual (I don't think Napolean was actually a midget, but damn if it wasn't funny), but stilla great show that should've continued for several more seasons.

$REVIEW.: In 1973, author John Godey created the thriller novel "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three".  A film that received an adaptation in 1974 courtesy of screenwriter Peter Stone ("Charade", "The Truth About Charlie") and director John Sargent ("Jaws: The Revenge", "Warm Springs").The film was well-received by film critics and would be nominated for several awards.The popularity of the film would lead to a TV film adaptation in 1998 (starring Edward James Olmos), which was more faithful to the novel but to make it more modern, while the latest film adaptation titled "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3' from 2009 starring John Travolta and Denzel Washington would be more raw, vicious and feature modern technology and with key differences from the 1974 version.While the 2009 version didn't do as well and was criticized by critics, many have wondered how the 1974 version of the film was.  And now, the Blu-ray release of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is now available.VIDEO:"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is a 1974 film and there is a good amount of grain.  I felt that the picture quality was much better than from what I remembered of the film, especially towards the closeups where I found a bit more detail.  The film was never vibrant in colors, if anything, it was a bit of dreary under the tunnels and where most of the brightness was towards the command center and outdoor scenes.Black levels are deep, I didn't notice any artifacting, banding or edge enhancement.  Considering the film was shot in the early '70s, the picture quality was much better than I expected.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is presented in English mono DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish mono and French mono.  For this Blu-ray release, you are given the choice to have a lossless mono left and right track or to have it play through the center channel.  I chose to have the audio play on all channels as I prefer a bit of immersiveness.  Dialogue is clear but because this is a monaural track track, one can't expect too much, but wit the setup that I had of stereo on all channels, the soundtrack definitely sounds good during the more action-intense moments towards the end and also during the machine gun exchange towards the middle of the film.SPECIAL FEATURES"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" comes with the original theatrical trailer in HD (duration: 2:30).JUDGMENT CALL:The original film adaptation of "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" so far remains the best version of the film to date, despite the modern remakes decades after this film's release.There is one primary reason why the original shines in my opinion and that is because it reflects on a time period of how America was at the time.  How New York was at the time.New York during the seventies was not the cleaned up post-Giulani way it is now.  There was racial tension, there was a lot of crime, there was prostitution all over the streets and I think the Blu-ray release that goes in to great detail of how bad it was back then was the recent Blur-ray release of "Taxi Driver" (1976)."The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is essentially a portrait of how America once was, from the character Lt. Zachary Garber (played by Walter Matthau) treating the Japanese guests by calling them names and even shocked when he finds out the NYC police officer he was talking to all this time was a Black man.  Then there is Mr. Grey calling the Black passenger the "N-word" and even the mention of "Attica" painted a picture of an America that was tense due to the racial conflicts at the time.This is one area that can't be redone in any remake.  The early '70s, especially a film that takes place in New York City had this seediness, this portrayal on film that was drab, the police were often featured as inept, as well as its mayor.  The film was obviously a message or a statement of how things were at the time.So, a politically correct remake of this film, even if the most recent version featured more violent, I don't care about humanity type of hijackers post-9/11, New York today has evolved to a much better city than it was in the '70s.And when you go back to watching this film, there was a sense of hell breaking loose!  I loved how there was this counter argument between Garber and Correll, especially towards each other.  And unlike films today, where hostage films have a negotiator trying to play nice, this film showed Garber and even Lt. Rico Patrone adding their comments towards the hijackers of how they think of them.  Something you just don't see in today's films.And of course, the villains.  It was a much more intriguing film to have someone leading the group who sounded like an intellectual, violent enemy rather than a crazed lunatic as portrayed in the remake version of the film.But what it all comes down to is character portrayal.  The recent version of the film is your typical, forgettable banal popcorn-action film, the 1998 TV film is just a TV film and this original film adaptation from 1974 was a raw, in your face action/suspense film that had more in tune with how New York City was for its time.  The original is a much better film.As for the Blu-ray release, it's your usual barebones release that I wish had more to offer in special features but doesn't.  Picture quality is very good for a film that is nearly 40-years-old and yes, it would be nice if given a 5.1 lossless soundtrack but the monaural lossless soundtrack still makes this Blu-ray release the definitive version of the 1974 film to own at this moment.If you want to see the best version of "The Taking of Pelman One Two Three", this is the one you want!Recommended!
$review_summary.: Blu-ray: The original 1974 film captures the gritty, racially charged times of NYC and much better than the 2009 film!

$review_text.: I had heard nothing but kudos about "A History of Violence" and certain critics bemoaning the fact that this film did not make the Oscar cut, so I was ready to pop in the DVD and be amazed.Maybe I had my hopes just too high, but I was disappointed.The story centers on Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), a small town family man who runs a local diner, his wife Edie (Maria Bello), and their two children, Jack (who is being bullied at school by the local high school sports hero-jackass) and Sarah (who suffers from nightmares). Basically, your average American family, at least on the surface.One day, two thugs from out of town stop in to the diner intending to rob it and kill everyone (Tom, his two employees and two teens on a date) present.  Tom ends up kicking some major butt and killing the two thugs in under thirty seconds.  The news media, in what is obviously a slow news week, descends on Tom's small town and makes him an overnight media hero.  This is where the real problems start for Tom.Before you know it, men from Philly show up (including Ed Harris, spectacular as always and in much too small of a role) claiming that Tom is really Joey Cusack from Philly, a bad guy/hitman type.Is Tom really Joey?  Did he run from the mob?  If he was Joey, is it possible that he left all that behind is now Tom?  How will his family react?The idea is a good one, with many possibilities but this is where the movie fell apart for me.  The film left a huge dramatic possibility in the scene where Jack ends up beating the tar out of the kid bullying him.  This certainly should have opened a well of conflicts in Tom - - did he pass this "trait" along to his son?  How could he tell him not to punch someone, given his violent background?  Did the film show Tom grappling with this conflict, maybe even a worry that Jack might end up just like Tom?  Nope.  Tom tells Jack that their family doesn't hit people, Jack makes a smart-alecked remark, Tom slaps Jack and that's the end of it.  Edie at least throws up upon learning of her husband's sordid background, and gets in a slapping, shoving and punching fight with him - - that ends up with the two of them having sex on the stairs.  Yes, that's right - - having violent sex on the stairs.  I had a hard time believing this - - not just because Edie had just seen her husband kill two men, but she had also found out about his past - - and let's not forget, that they have two children at home who could have walked in any moment.But even forgetting about those problems, the ending was a massive disappointment.  Tom returns from Philly, after having seen Richie Cusack, Joey's brother (a nice little cameo by William Hurt).  Edie, Jack and Sarah are having dinner and Tom walks in.  My first thought was that if I was Edie I would have changed the locks.  But that's just me - - Tom walks in, sits down at the dinner table, everyone looks at each other and the  movie fades out.  What??  What kind of sorry ending is THAT?  It tells us nothing - - had Edie just accepted her husband?  Are they just never going to mention this again?  Disappointing is an understatement, this ending was a complete let down and a complete sell out.Overall, other than Ed Harris, none of the acting performances jumped out at me and I really didn't understand what all the critics were doing putting this film on their Top Ten list for the year.  Definitely some better choices out there.Maybe the film might have done a little more for me had it just focused on Tom's family life and the effect this had on his family - - or maybe had Ed Harris played Tom the movie might have had a different flavor.But I'm giving it 2 stars, for Ed Harris' performance.

Well, it just goes to show you that you don't know how good or bad something is until it's finished and ready (with some notable exceptions, of course).I'm not going to spoil any of the plot for you, I'm just going to say that if you love the character of Rocky Balboa, this is the fitting and just sendoff that his story demanded, and much better than could ever have been expected

Plus, the film's center has a surprisingly tender heart at its core with Stallone (who also wrote and directed the film) reminding us what a charismatic, charming on-screen persona he has
He should be proud of this last round for The Rock.Hope you enjoy it as much the hooting, laughing and cheering audience did that I saw it in the theater with.

$REVIEW.: Rushmore is a movie about friendship and the strains it can have. Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) attends a prestigious prep school because his  mother got him in. Even though he's in every extracurricular club, he's  failing his classes. It's ironic because he's brilliant and could get all  As if he wanted to. Bill Murray is Harold Blume, an alumni of Rushmore. He  befriends Max and gives him a role model. Things change when they fall for  the same schoolteacher (Olivia Williams). Other stellar characters are  Max's protoge and his wise barber father. I liked Max's precocious self and  his relationship with Blume. This is not you typical comedy and may not  seem that funny at first. Bill Murray is not in your typical slapstick  role. But if you sit and think about it, you will realize that it's  hilarious.

$review_text.: This series is the best one to understand and maybe even experience (the section on the use ofpoison gas) the "Great War/WWI." I agree with the many other reviewers who wish it was onDVD. I assume rights problems have kept this from happening.I do know that as an American History teacher this series was an invaluable resource for meto allow my students to try to learn/understand about WWI. The strongest sections include those on poison gas (see above),the effects of the war on civilians, the industrializing of killing with artillery and machine guns at neverbefore seen volume, the US role and the home front problems here, new weapons and especiallythe failure of Wilson and others at Versailles that led directly to WWII and many problems in the MiddleEast, Asia (the Vietnam War) and elsewhere. Finally, it conveys the sense of staggering loss andbitterness felt by Europeans especially. As one said, cheering for the war's end was like cheering in a"charnel house."

$review_text.: NO SPOILERS:Let's get right to it.  What makes Person of Interest work is the phenomenal cast.  Perhaps the best on network TV.Starting with Jim Caviezel (John Reese) and Michael Emerson (Harold Finch).Who can forget Kevin Chapman (former Providence Irish mob boss) and the corrupt cop Lionel Fusco (offered a chance at redemption by Reese).Thrown into the mix are a trifecta of hotties with recurring roles:1.) Joss Whedon alum Amy Acker, as elite hacker with an agenda, "Root"2.) Fixer and sometime Reese love interest "Zoe" played by Paige Turco3.) Less us not forget Sarah Shahi playing somewhat out of character as, stoic & burned former goverment assassin, "Samantha Shaw" Admittedly, I had hopes that we would at least catch Shahi coming out of cold shower!Now for the boys.  Enrico Colantoni (Flash Point and Veronica Mars alum) as imprisoned mob boss Elias. Surprisingly endearing and adding some comic relief is Leon Tao (Ken Leung), as the often troubled financial hacker who sometimes assists in cases.OK, so with a great cast, why not 5*?  The culprit is the writing/script.  IMHO, season 2 is much superior to season 1.  Starting with episode 14 (season 2) the script catches up with the 5* cast.  There is intrigue on several levels with Root (Acker) meeting Shaw (Shahi) in episode 16.  Episode 19 may just be the best episode of the series with several storylines coming together.  Elias admits that some outside force is posturing to take him out, Shaw re-emerges and decides that she will go after Root for some answers and then there is the re-emergence of the mysterious Englishman who is a point person for a shadowy organization, which has yet to be revealed.I am very exited for the final 3-episodes of the season.  Fans will be excited to know that Person of Interest has been renewed for 3rd season.

$review_text.: A pleasant holiday comedy.  If you like the intrigue of New York City magazines or Martha Stewart, you will probably find this 1945 film a fine diversion.  Barbara Stanwyck is fine as a columnist of a Better Homes & Garden (pre-Stewart) who has become famous with her imagined life on a farm in Connecticut. The head of the magazine division (a kind of Conde Nast character played by Sydney Greenstreet) invites himself and a World War II sailor hero to her farm (complete with husband and baby) for Christmas. Of course, she has none of this and has to quickly create it and that's where the comedy ensues. This is a screwball comedy so there's lots of confusion.  Some of the actors worked in &#34;Casablanca&#34; so there's that interesting overlay.  I don't think kids will like this, as it's a little slow.  But fine for high school and up.  Stanwyck is good, but pouty and her comic timing could be better.  Myrna Loy probably could have carried this off breezily.  Still, it's charming.

$REVIEW.: &#34;Haunted by a personal loss, a brilliant geneticist working on a top-secret project unwittingly unleashes a virus in this sci-fi thriller&#34; says the tag line.It seems from that sentence several reviewers were expecting a zombie movie, some were expecting a medical thriller others, well who knows
 But nothing in the tag line suggests zombie movie or medical thriller


 Some complained they didn't see an unleashed virus creating a global plague

 That's not what this film is about


 It's a pensive, moody, well acted, well written journey into regret


 And yes, if you paid attention you'd realize the virus was unleashed

 The fact that you don't see the outcome, in society as a whole, of that unleashing doesn't mean the infected mouse who scurries away is not the vector


 It is established earlier in the film that they are creating a virus that is blood born and carried by mosquitos, ticks and fleas


 Thus the mouse would infect the fleas that would obviously soon find him and they would in turn infect the human population

 The Easter gene, probably called that because of resurrection being associated with Easter, does not ultimately kill as our protagonist becomes painfully aware
 If you aren't paying attention the nuance of the film may escape you but for those who did pay attention that extra dimension is found there in the tears coming down Rebecca's face when she asks our protagonist, now a patient at the same research institute, why his son didn't recover


 The only answer can be, and one that informs the internal angst of regrets from the first scenes on is that our protagonist must have put his own child out of its suffering
 This film deserves 4 stars for not relying on clich&eacute;s, tricks and deus ex machina to tell the story
 It is nice and tightly written unlike other sci fi films by better known film makers.If you need clich&eacute;'s, tricks and special effects to enjoy a film, this isn't for you


 This actually engages several brain cells at the same time and makes them sit up and take notice

 It's nice to find a well written script that doesn't rely on special effects to tell the story as is so often the case with lazy film makers these days.Bravo.

$review_text.: I can't believe I waited almost a year to see this

I was unexpectedly surprised and very satisfied with Spielberg's latest film (his best since Catch Me If You Can a decade ago), based on the critically-acclaimed play of the same name.It has a charming enough beginning and premise: a young man takes in an injured horse and trains him to plow, hoping to raise enough money to save his family's farm
As World War I breaks out, however, the family is forced to sell the horse and the movie truly begins.While I expected a standard narrative, the film functioned in a much more interesting way: the horse passed between different parties, British and German soldiers, a young French girl, and others throughout the course of the war

I won't give any spoilers but the ending is incredibly moving and satisfying.The movie seems to drag on during the second hour (clocks in at almost 150 minutes), but the payoff is well worth it

The wide variety of characters are able to come together in a believable scenario, illustrating how much the horse and the war has changed all of them.It is in this last ten minutes or so that the film truly blew me away; the characters gave incredibly stirring speeches, evoking themes of sacrifice, loss, and redemption.In addition to the wonderful emotional power of this film, it is also very well shot and produced

The stunning imagery is often reminiscent of Gone With the Wind, of characters in desperate situations silhouetted against a fiery orange sky
Their identities aren't what matters; it is the extraordinary circumstances they face and how they meet those circumstances that make this a genuinely heartfelt and inspirational work.

$review_text.: Released just long enough ago to be forgotten by today's standard of speed amnesia, this film by Oliver Stone is worth seeing again. The violence in it was sickening years ago, but such things have quickly gotten normalized in our culture's ongoing desensitization. Ironically, this very process of media desensitization is precisely the topic of this film's satire. On top of that, few understood Stone's film was a satire and instead accused him of promoting violence. This is a tragedy because "Natural Born Killers" really is a sharp and funny satire that helped to usher in the 90s with Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction".It might be over the top, violent, and flashy but it works! The effect may make you a bit dizzy, it may disturb, and may even offend you, but it's great cinema. "In Cold Blood", "Badlands", and "Bonnie & Clyde", can be compared to this film due to fact its about two killers on the road who are madly in love with each other. Unlikely movie stars Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play Mickey and Malory. Through a few frantic and imaginative scenes we see them meet, fall in love, murder Malory's abusive father, and hit the road. These scenes are instantly unforgettable, bearing a wit that may be overt, but is funny enough to accept. Meanwhile our heroes become a media sensation thanks to the TV show "American Maniacs", hosted by Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr. with a British accent).Under-appreciated actor Tom Sizemore ("True Romance", "Heat") plays detective Jack Scagnetti, the celebrity homicide cop who pursues and eventually captures Mickey and Malory (in what has to be one of the best, most intense arrest scenes in screen history). In the context of this film, he is a villain, but he is a human being just the same. He leads us into the second half of this picture, which has Mickey and Malory behind bars awaiting a big TV interview with Wayne Gale on Super bowl Sunday. Tensions build to one of the best climaxes a crime or prison movie ever had.Rodney Dangerfield, Russell Means, and Tommy Lee Jones put in highly memorable appearances in supporting roles. On the director's cut DVD we see cut footage of performances from Ashley Judd (her best work) and Dennis Leary. "Natural Born Killers" is many great small parts adding up to an even better whole.If your curious about "Natural Born Killers" then I recommend this film to you, including the movies I mentioned above. This film will simply blow you away, in the good sense.
$SUMMARY.: One of  Oliver Stone's best films.

The telegraph wires were down, and Thomas realizes that the encounter had been in vain, because General Lee had surrendered three days earlier


Langdon, on the other hand, knew this fact a day before his battle


To him, it was not futile
He resolved to keep on fighting
For now, his men would hide their arms, disguise themselves as civilians, and march to Mexico, where he would meet with Emperor Maximilian.Months later, Thomas finds himself in Mexico, and he runs into his old nemesis


The two men are surprised to learn that they had been on direct opposite sides at several key battles


Each complains of the casualties inflicted by the other side to his men
Thomas wants to move on, while Langdon continues to identify himself as a Confederate.A group of Mexican revolutionaries hosts the Confederates with an elaborate meal
Then they draw their guns, and call the Confederates their prisoners


It is a trap

Langdon is released with a ransom demand
Either all the surrounding men give up their horses, or the captive Confederate soldiers will all be shot

What will Thomas and his forces do? Will Langdon finally forget the Civil War and return his loyalties to the USA? What will Thomas' adopted Indian son do? The plot thickens...

$REVIEW.: Man, lotsa people are taking this movie way to seriously, particularly those who don't like it.  Frankly, I don't know what most of the negative reviewers were doing in the theater in the first place.  It's a big, stupid, over the top action-adventure movie that 3 hours long.  If that doesn't sound appealing to you, stay away.  Of course, I'm not typically that big on this kinda thing either.  I'm not really opposed to it in theory, but this kinda ultra-populist stuff is almost guaranteed to be to gutless and middle of the road.  Fortunately, Peter Jackson is no Michael Bay, and while I'm not as big on his stuff as many others, he definitely has a grasp on this sorta material.  Of course, this doesn't totally compare to the LOTR movies, as those were quite a bit more serious, but his ability to work with grand action scenes remains here.  And frankly, it seems like I shouldn't like this movie as much as I do, as it does have a number of problems.  But, what can I say, I had a helluva good time.Many, many people have complained that this movie is too long.  I disagree.  I mean, geez, it's an epic.  It's supposed to feel big and the length fits the general tone and mood of the film.  The increase in length is largely just a sorta ballooning of the elements that were already in the original.  The one major exception is the addition of the bizarre romantic relationship between Kong and Ann.  I think this works a lot better than I would've anticipated, but that no great feat as I anticipated that it wouldn't work at all.  I think it's interesting that this romantic subplot seems far more tailored for male tastes than female.  After all, it is the story of the big, stupid, ugly filthy man-beast that earns the love of beautiful woman for no apparent reason, other than, perhaps, the sheer fact that he really, really likes her.  That and I gotta wonder how many women are really wishing that King Kong will come take them away.  Still, though this stuff works alright, it's too drawn out.  To be blunt, these scenes take up a lot of screen time, and there just isn't a whole helluva that can happen in them, what with Kong being unable to talk and all.  So it largely comes down to alternating close-ups.  Man, you wouldn't believe how much time is spent with the camera pointing at Watts while she is looking at Kong in an affectionate manner.  Personally, I wouldn't have thought that a film could spend too much time staring at Naomi Watts in closeup, but there ya have it.The film does have a fairly lengthy opening section, but I was always passably amused.  It spends most of this time introducing us to a lot a deliberately cliched characters and a sorta intentionally dated either excessively whimsical or ominous tone.  I certainly can understand why some people would be bored with this portion of the film.  In fact, it's seems like I should've been, but I wasn't, so whatever.  But seriously, people need to get over this.  The movie has got like 2 hours of action in it, so the longer wait has got a longer payoff.Once they actually get to Skull Island we are fairly quickly treated to some more or less endless action scenes, and they are generally quite spectacular.  The one exception is the big, silly dinosaur stampede, which is just too wackily improbable, and just doesn't look very good.  It is kinda amusing in it's stupidity, but that ain't worth too much  Many have complained about the frightening, demonic natives, but I think they work very well and are, well, frightening and demonic.  Accusations of racism are stupid-- These people aren't related to anyone in the real world, what with their not being any Skull Island.  And frankly, I think you'd be pretty crazy and upset if you lived on an island filled with monsters, regardless of your race. But, on the other hand, maybe the critics are right.  Maybe they  shoulda had the nutty natives be a bunch've white men in business suit.  Thatta really made ya think.After Skull Island things are perhaps drawn out a little too much.  We don't really learn anything new in the delay between the major action scenes, and it would flow better if Jackson had tightened things up a bit.  Still, once Kong gets back to smashing stuff it's pretty sweet.  The finale is also pretty well done, though I think it's a bit excessively operatic.  Again, this goes back to the whole overly drawn out Kong-Ann angle, and we can only stand to see Ann being sad that Kong is going to die for so long before it gets a little tiresome.The acting is generally pretty stylized, so it isn't really good by modern standards, but it does fit the mood of the film.  Many have complained about Jack Black's performance, and while I hate Jack Black I think he's getting a bit too bad of a rap here.  Yes, he can't really handle the more dramatic scenes so well, and I definitely wearied of looking at his fat face, but he's fine in the lighter parts of his performance. (Which, of course, makes up the vast majority of his role.)  Watts is good enough as Ann, making her affection for Kong more plausible than one might've anticipated.  Brody is a little dull as Jack, but he doesn't have much of a role, frankly.  No one else stands out too much other than Thomas Kretschmann as the ultra surly, eastern european boat captain with a heart of gold.  What can I say, I like that guy.I guess that's it.  This is a just a big, fun, silly movie, albeit with some heart.  About as good as this kinda thing gets.  File alongside `The Mummy' and `Pirates of the Caribbean'.Grade: B+/A- Can't decide

One of his favorites, among a lot of the guys then - was and still is Arnold.When this came in, he was surprised I'd gotten it and told him I'd remembered the huge Weider book he had that looked older than me, and how I thought he would like seeing all of the weightlifting studs of the day on the set.He'd popped it in and you could tell it was like turning back the clock, the way he named off the weightlifters back then, which guys were cool, which guys were dirty or just immature towards others, and he would tell me quick stories of what they did. It was interesting.I'd gotten into watching with him and it is a great movie to share with someone who enjoyed, or anyone for that matter, the age of the body builder and Arnold, someone who has a knack with people (the prison scene) - you can see why he was very popular back then.The quality was great, and am grateful I bought it so I could share something like it with my dad.

$review_text.: Davie & Golimyr is a DVD release from Anchor Bay/Starz productions.  The story is a new take on the old biblical tale of David and Goliath.  Instead of boring old computer animation, the filmmakers used claymation and some very nifty camerawork.  This new version breathes life into the often told story of good triumphing over evil.  Davie is young and idealistic kid who tries to topple the giant Golimyr.  But his first attempt ends in utter failure and embarrassment.  So, he works hard to try and best the goliath with the help of Chops his faithful sidekick and belief in himself to save the day.  But will it be enough?The DVD is real bare bones, except for some previews for other kid friendly programs.  Davie & Golimyr is presented in full-frame and in 2.0 English soundtrack.

$REVIEW.: Why do people always complain that movies are a BAD TRANSFER onto DVD? I just recently picked up this DVD for 3.99 in a cheap bin, watched it and it looks fine to me
They talk about it being a bad transfer just because it's full screen, and it's not pan & scan or any of that crap
There's 2 things to remember here ok? it's a low budget 80's film! and was probably re-released by some low budget company
I thought the transfer was great


Sure the movie looked a bit old, but you can't expect them to remaster a low budget movie like this unless it had potential to get some good sales

And also, who in the right mind can afford a Widescreen tv, and if they did afford one, who would want this movie in widescreen format? Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty good movie, but it's not the greatest.anyway, on to my review

I rented this movie when I was a kid, probably a few months after seeing Dirty Dancing, and it bored me senseless

Probably because being around 10 years old, you wouldn't be interested, or understand the story

So recently I was walking through an A & P grocery store and came across it in a cheap bin for 3.99 and decided to pick it up
I read a review on here of someone saying it was a bad transfer and that the movie sucked

Well I strongly disagree

I find the picture nice and clear, and the sound quality is great for DVD, even though I think it's only 2 channels of sound, but it don't matter to me.I would normally give this movie a 4, but since I only paid 3.99 and I probably won't watch it as often I give it a 3
I only give movies a 4 or 5 rating if I can watch them over and over again without getting bored of them
so a 3 is a decent rating

If you like dramas with more realistic stories then this is the movie for you, and don't let anyone sway you by saying this movie sucks, because I liked it

I thought the fact that it was filmed in a small town was interesting and more REAL


So if you relate to small town life, this movie might interest you.

$REVIEW.: Theatrical releases, supposedly, offer more than the fare that one finds on the small screen. Producers of these have the luxury of acquiring A-level actors and, conversely, A-level scripts.Well, "Cheaper By the Dozen" does sport a star that frequently rises to the occasion in quality material (Steve Martin), an ingenue for the teenybopper set (Hilary Duff), a hunk on the rise ("Smallville's Tom Wellig) and an actor whose fame and popularity is mindboggling (Ashton Kutcher). It's sad, however, that these performers, along with Bonnie Hunt, Richard Jenkins, and the other ten kids, are saddled with such a derivative script.I mean, Lucille Ball & Henry Fonda, Brian Keith & Doris Day, and Robert Reed & Florence Henderson tred upon the same domestic waters in "Yours, Mine, and Ours," "With Six, You Get Eggroll," and television's "The Brady Bunch" with better results.You know, the pratfalls of raising a HUGE family and still maintaining two careers.SPOILERS: The adolescent humor consists primarily of falling chandeliers, slipping on body fluids, exploding playground equipment, a wayward frog, and a truly juvenile scene involving groundbeef and an actor's crotch.Certainly, the stuff of "quality" filmmaking!In hindsight, I'm not sure if this one would make the grade on Fox Family!

$REVIEW.: THE BROKEN TOWER will likely never be on the list of best films made, so why award it five stars? Because this very fine art piece is the result of the devotion of James Franco to his craft.  He worked directly with Boston College professor Paul Mariani, the author of a half dozen volumes of poetry, as well as several biographies of 20th-century American poets, including William Carlos Williams, John Berryman, and Robert Lowell: Franco based THE BROKEN TOWER on Mariani's similarly titled 2000 biography of Crane.The subject of the film is the life and creative genius of Hart Crane, (July 21, 1899 - April 27, 1932) an American poet who found both inspiration and provocation in the poetry of T. S. Eliot, Crane wrote modernist poetry that is difficult, highly stylized, and very ambitious in its scope. In his most ambitious work, The Bridge, Crane sought to write an epic poem in the vein of The Waste Land that expressed something more sincere and optimistic than the ironic despair that Crane found in Eliot's poetry. In the years following his suicide at the age of 32, Crane has come to be seen as one of the most influential poets of his generation.James Franco wrote the screenplay based on book by Paul Mariani, directed and edited the film and acted the main role of Hart Crane.  Crane was a nearly disconsolate man who refused to follow his wealthy father's business, longing instead to be a poet. Born in Ohio he traveled to New York (the place he always considered home), to Cuba, and to Paris searching for his poetic voice.  He was a gay man in an era when his lifestyle was always under threat, he had a lover (Vince Jolivette) early on in an affair that was filled with passion, and in his travels he seemed to find his true love in Emile (Michael Shannon) that endured the manic highs and depressive, death-haunted lows that befell this self -destructive visionary poet. He attempted suicide at least once and finally ended his life in a successful suicide at the young age of 32.Franco breathes life into Hart Crane, offering more understanding of this enigmatic genius than we have ever been afforded.  In making the film Franco uses his younger brother Dave Franco to depict the young Hart and selects his small cast wisely. The film is completely in black and white and is in the format of `Voyages' - each voyage takes us through a distinct part of Hart's life: his gay loves, his poetry readings, his forays to Cuba and to Paris and his lonely hours of sitting before an old typewriter where he created the major epics of poetry that remain some of the finest ever written by an American poet.The film is choppy, not unlike the manner in which Hart's mind worked in bits and pieces, always immersed in thoughts of the sea, the labor of common man, of the Brooklyn Bridge which would play the major role in his most famous epic poem THE BRIDGE, and of the fellow artists whose work he so admired. There is a strange musical score (the work of Neil Benezra) which is long on choral chanting, and a quality of gritty cinematography achieved by Christiana Vorn. The technique of the making of this film matches the vision of James Franco in continuing to visit the lives of isolated geniuses.  The dialogue, what little there is, is Crane's poetry as spoken by Franco.For many this film will seem self-indulgent on Franco's part.  And perhaps it partially is.  But the flavor of this gay American poet of the 1920s and the reflections of America at that time ring true.  THE BROKEN TOWER is not a biopic of Hart Crane.  It is an elegy.  Grady Harp, February 12

$REVIEW.: These prints are an improvement on Hallmark releases and TCM broadcast versions. The textures are clearer as is the contrast. You can see makeup lines and things like bottles are noticeably sharper. But if you're expecting pristine, crystal clear, absolutely clean prints you will be disappointed. But since this is the first complete collection of their great series of sound shorts and Hal Roach feature films and since the package comes to about $2 per hour and $6 per disc, this is definitely a bargain. Only one of my discs had any kind of blemish on it and I like the space-saving package design. Seeing these familiar old films in greater clarity just makes them seem more real, fresh and funny.Strangely, Jerry Lewis in the tribute feature claims that Stan found Oliver working in the Hal Roach construction department, put him into show business and taught him everything he knows. All of which is untrue so why would Jerry's statements be included in this tribute? Oliver began acting in films in 1914, 12 years before his teaming up with Stan. If you're paying tribute to somebody they should get their facts straight and not just pass along some misremembered secondhand celebrity stories.

$review_text.: TWELVE ANGRY MEN is unique in being one of the few films based on a television screenplay.  The movie developed out of Reginald Rose's 1954 teleplay for "Studio One," and was just a critical success that it was filmed for general film release in 1957.This film is all about one thing:  great acting.  The plot itself is as simple as any in the movies:  a jury convenes to render its verdict in a murder trial.  The initial vote is eleven guilty and one not guilty.  The remainder of the movie consists of the lone not guilty overcoming the prejudices, the biases, and the inner personal demons of the other eleven.The ostensible star of the film is Henry Fonda, but all twelve actors do stunning jobs in their respective roles, and the way that these twelve extremely distinct personalities interact is one of the great joys of the film.  The film ends up a character study, as the moral and emotional make up of each individual is reveals as each personal reveals his reasons for defending his guilty or not guilty vote.  Many of the actors were stalwarts of the American stage.  Henry Fonda is best known as a film actor, but he frequently in his career made trips back to the stage.  Lee J. Cobb made nearly a hundred films, but far and away his greatest achievements were on stage, in particular in arguably the greatest role in an American stage play in the 20th century:  creating the role of Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN.  E. G. Marshall is another actor familiar on screen, but whose greatest work was in theater.  The same is true of Martin Balsam and Jack Warden, who made his film debut in this movie.  But it isn't fair to do anything but praise all twelve actors.  Every single one leaves his mark on this film.Any fan of great cinema or great acting needs to see this film.There was later a first rate recreation of this film in color done for cable TV.  Jack Lemmon capably performed the Henry Fonda role and George C. Scott one.  Not quite as good as the original, but still exceedingly watchable.

$review_text.: This was Jerry Orbach's first year as Detective Lennie Briscoe


My wish is that when I first saw the episode Point of View, that is would've been my first time meeting Detective Briscoe as he stepped through the steam, placing his gold detective's shield on his front jacket pocket, his shirt without a tie
He teases the personnel of the Crime Scene Unit as he wearily walks over to talk to the patrol officers who responded, noticing (PDR)powder donuts residue on the officer's blue shirt
The episodes were strong and centered around some of the most powerful issues
From used pacemakers to the death of a gay police officer


From the assassination of a civil rights leader to a computer hacker spreading a computer into a hospital computer


Some of the episodes include "Conspiracy," "Self Defense," "Prince of Darkness," "Point of View," "Mandhood" and "Benevolence." This was also Paul Sorvino's last episode as Sergeant Phil Cerreta
People involved in this season include Rene Balcer, Micheal S


Chernuchin, Walon Green, Robert Nathan, Ed Zuckerman, Ed Sherin, William N


Fordes, among other producers/writers well known in the franchise


Season three is a must have all fans of everything Law & Order, for it was the season that premiered the episode that introduced us to Detective Lennie Briscoe for the first time

This was the season where Jerry Orbach finally made it into the main cast of the show after years trying and the beginning of the Briscoe/Logan partnership.

$REVIEW.: I LOVE this movie!!  It's spooky, the architecture is great, and the cinematography is excellent.  I'm confused, however, on what we're supposed to think of the film.  The husband is REALLY hot and nice, but the female lead is frigid and annoying....and even more annoying is her maid Zucchini.  Are we supposed to feel sorry for the frigid wife with the really hot husband?  I think he should have just thrown her out, and found a nice guy who wouldn't be so frigid.

$REVIEW.: I've been completely addicted to this series since I watched the original movie When Calls The Heart. Then I was excited to learn that the Hallmark Channel had decided to pick this one up as a series and continue the story from best selling author Janette Oke. In this DVD, When Calls The Heart: Lost and Found, we find that Elizabeth Thatcher has left her wealthy and prominent life to journey west to become a teacher in Coal Valley. She believes despite all her father's misgivings she can do what they believe she can't. Armed with nothing more than her clothes and some books, she is soon the victim of a stage coach robbery that leaves her with little more than the clothes on her back. She arrives at the request of the women of Coal Valley that have suffered the loss of their husbands and older children in a mining explosion. Their only hope is that Elizabeth can educate their children so that they don't have to become miners when they grow up.But Elizabeth isn't at all prepared for what she is hoping for and thus no matter how hard she struggles to fit in, she is more of a challenge than she thinks. From learning to deal with issues that the children are facing to establishing the school in a saloon during the day, there are numerous laughs to be found along the way. Elizabeth's biggest ally is Abigail  Stanton who has lost both her husband and son in the mining explosion. Yet both women persevere despite all the odds against them. Abigail dispenses motherly wisdom to Elizabeth when she feels overcome by the challenges facing her on the frontier and the two become friends.Jack Thornton arrives as someone Elizabeth's father has hired to watch over his daughter while she insists on taking up the teaching in Coal Valley. Soon the sparks fly between the two even though they fight the attraction brewing between them. Yet after some time, Elizabeth soon discovers that Jack is more than just a friend and the harder they try to fight their romantic feelings the more they each are drawn closer together.I received When Calls the Heart: Lost and Found compliments of Word Films, The Hallmark Channel and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for my honest review and the opinions expressed are strictly my own unless otherwise noted. It's so wonderful to know that in a world where choices in television and movie entertainment is becoming challenging for families that a series like When Calls the Heart comes along. Completely suitable for all ages in your family it reminds me of Little House on the Prairie from my own childhood. This series is directed by Michael Landon Jr and produced and written by Brian Bird and will be one that I am sure you will LOVE. My entire family LOVES this series from my youngest daughter at 15 to my husband. This DVD will be the start of an incredible journey for you and your family and one I can easily give a 5 out of 5 stars too!

$REVIEW.: Every time I see a film with Matt Damon in it, it's always an outstanding film--it's not just his acting and the action scenes, it's always the pace of the film and the fascinating plots. Although he's not hard to look at, it's really his characters that stand out more. He never tries to be too cute or too masculine--he's just a strong performer, and this film is an example of that.The film is about a team called the Adjustment Bureau who are doing everything within their powers to make sure that David Norris (played by Damon) does not get off-track for an election. They think he's good enough to be the president, but if he ends up meeting and falling in love with Elise Sellas (played by Emily Blunt), then that'll change her future as a dancer and his political future. While David is fighting to hold on to Elise, Elise has no idea that there's a team hell bent on making sure the two don't end up together, and when David finds out he has to make a decision that'll affect both of their lives for the worst, she may not be too happy.Doesn't that just sound like a good plot? I see why he took the film. Then again, I see why he takes on all of his films.

$REVIEW.: On a good day I'd just rave about how The Tick is one of the two or three funniest and clever animated series ever, portraying superheros as flawed, dysfunctional people with their own issues to deal with as they try to rid The City of evil.  The Tick and Arthur are great characters in and of themselves, but it's the ensemble of not-all-too-perfect superheros that appear in the various episodes that are the icing on the satirical cake here.I'm really just happy to see this series on DVD at any price because I never thought this would actually happen!However, on a bad day I'd rant about how I'm paying twenty-five dollars for a bit over a single disc (a rather empty second disc) with no bonus features.  What's with that?  But we have to buy it anyway so that future seasons will eventually come to market, because if we don't buy this they may not make any more of them.  That really makes me feel passive-agressive.But any day with a Tick episode you haven't seen in 12 years is likely going to be a good day!  The Tick truly puts the "fun" in dysfunctional.

However, when Maggie arrives three days late to the set she finds a disorganized film company trying to hold together a group of actors, a crew, and filmmakers who all have different agendas. Nevertheless, Maggie tries her hardest to fit in, even though she does not speak any French, and she tries to get a good grip of the character that she intends to cast. Meanwhile, the director is having problems keeping himself emotionally together and the film's future becomes jeopardized. Irma Vep is an interesting film that portraits thoughts that are not followed through with or that cannot be followed through with unless they are organized.

$REVIEW.: South by SW is an annual happening in Austin Texas. The concluding Saturday of every SXSW festival has a free concert lakeside in downtown Austin. This year the headliners were Los Lonely boys from nearby San Angelo, Texas.I actually had no idea they had national renown until I turned on the Latin Grammy's and saw them with Santana. This has most of their songs from the debut album and some excellent muscianship. Fans of the album will not be disappointed at all.I especially like Hollywood, Nobody Else, and Heaven is great. There are a number of extended guitar solos, drumming, jamming, and a few drum solos. Even some harmonica and gazoo playing.The extras are nice if not that long. The best by far is the look at their hometown of San Angelo and going back to their old schools and homes. Anyone who likes their music will be pleased to have this in their collection. And unlike movie videos this can be viewed and enjoyed over and over and over with no lose of enjoyment. Those of you elsewhere go and see them if you get a chance. I was out of town for this concert so it is nice that I get to see what I missed that night.

$review_text.: "The Jeff Foxworthy Show" is responsible for a number of careers, namely those of Haley Joel Osment, Jonathan Lipnicki, Bill Engvall, and, perhaps the biggest star of them all, Matt Borlenghi.  Yes, you know him, star of stage and screen, and obviously fond of monster crocodiles, being that "DinoCroc" is his second foray into crocdom.  His other "croc" film was "Blood Surf," which is actually a very funny B-flick.This time around, Borlenghi actually gives it a really good ol' college try as Tom, resident of a sleepy little town with a huge reservoir and a slimy corporate science firm, Gereco Laboratories.  It's Gereco who's responsible for unleashing the dinocroc on the innocent people of Tom's tiny town.  They also attempt to cover up the death and destruction that the local sheriff (the underused Charles Napier) and his dogcatcher daughter are trying to make sense of.Gereco is headed up by the sinisterly sexy Joanna Pacula, who sends out well-meaning Dr. Campbell to capture the escaped beast.  You may recognize Campbell (Bruce Weitz) from his days as the lovable little "Animal" from "Hill Street Blues."  He fails in his initial attempt to snag the beast, so in comes Dick(Costas Mandylor).  Think of Mandylor as the real "Crocodile Hunter," Steve Irwin if Irwin were a tad bit of a bumhole who doesn't follow-up too well on his croc captures.  You'll understand what I mean if you watch the whole flick.As the movie rolls along at a decent pace, we are introduced to three-legged Lucky, the wonder mutt, and Tom's little brother (Jake Thomas), who also happens to be Hilary Duff's little brother from "Lizzie Maguire."  *Spoiler* He has quite an intense run-in with the croc, leading lovers of Lizzie's lil' bro weeping in the aisles.As a whole, this flick is pretty good.  The croc doesn't look too bad, though he seems to be standing under a spotlight every time he runs through the dark trees.  I'll agree with other reviewers that this film's ending is somewhat silly, but the rest of the film is just so doggone fun that I'll let the conclusion slide.If you enjoy creature features, "DinoCroc" will suffice.  It's not on the same level as "Anaconda" or "Lake Placid," and it's nowhere near "Jurassic Park," but "DinoCroc" will pass away a sleepy Sunday afternoon quite easily, and you won't feel completely cheated of your time.

$review_text.: GODZILLA VS BIOLANTE is one of the lesser films featuring the Big-G.  Toho had a long fallow period after King Kong vs Godzilla that was sprinkled with incredibly bad films (Terror of Mechagodzilla anyone?)This is the beginning of their comeback.  An interesting concept, some new and fascinating characters, and the same old ass-kicking Godzilla.The Blu-Ray features a first-rate print that does some justice to the effects of the film.  I might have wanted more extras but there are few here.  Still, if you're a G-Fan, you have to add this to your library.

$REVIEW.: Every time a big movie like this comes out my friend whips out his Blu-Ray version and I whip out my HD-DVD version.  We hook his PS3 to my Sony 1080p XBR3 46inch LCD t.v. and we go at it.  Every time we have done this HD-DVD has been the winner and 300 is no different.Both have awesome picture the Blu Ray and HD-DVD versions, but what makes the HD-DVD version stand out other than the loads of extra features is the sound quality.  I had the sound set at level 50 which was plenty loud, and when I would change between the PS3 and the Xbox 360 functions, the PS3 300 Blu Ray version was more quiet and sounded slightly muffed.  It was only recognizable when comparing it to the HD-DVD version.  Again, the sound for the HD-DVD was better, and to get the same level of "loudness" I had to go from level 50 to about 55 56.  To me that's a clear difference.Overall, the movie is fantastic and the HD-DVD version is clearly superior much like the majority of the titles out there for both formats.PLUS, I GOT IT AT CIRCUIT CITY AND PAID THE SAME PRICE AS THE BLU RAY VERSION $23.95.
$SUMMARY.: Compared Blu-Ray to HD-DVD...HD-DVD is clearly SUPERIOR

$REVIEW.: Along with the original "Scarface," released by Howard Hughes one year later, LeRoy's "Little Caesar" summoned up the real-life exploits of Al Capone, who in the prior decade had virtually controlled Chicago through fear, violence, and huge illicit profits from bootlegging and vice operations. Actor Robinson, a refined soul in real life who'd considered becoming a rabbi, actually resembles Capone, but projects a menace all his own. This makes "Little Caesar"--a landmark gangster film that made Robinson a star--still bone-chilling 75 years after its release.

$REVIEW.: A gargantuan killing machine, extant roughly 145 million years ago, is brought back to life with his own "back story".The killing machine was also a baby, a child, and an adolescent. Went from snagging insects to tackling killer machines his own size.This brilliantly conceived and executed program could be a permanent part of any curriculum, including informal home learning.One citicism, which actually extends back to the Speilberg classics. Why the human-like facial and body mannerisms? I can understand how kids might be scared by the "real deal", an entity terrifying enough to make even Spiderman take flight.In think, in 2008, even the "kiddies" can take a stronger dose of dino-reality. There was no cuteness. Unless they had a way of distorting themselves so as not to look menacing to those peaceful plant eaters - and today, [one of] their thriving descendents who hang out in swamps,  can "cry crocodile tears" prior to ripping apart a prosperous looking wildabeast

$REVIEW.: I have to chuckle when I see a review of this saying its full of twists and turns.  In fact, its 100% predictable and can be explained in one sentence..."Paralyzed man imagines fantasy where he is private dectective".  Care to guess the "trick" ending?Anyhow its a low budget movie where everything is just a bit off.  The characters dress and talk, more or less for the 1940s.  But they drive a 1959 Caddy.  And when the detective enters the blond's house, there's a modern motion detector for the burglar alarm, right over his head.  Whoops.But its not terrible.  BillyBob is in fine form and the others would probably be fine too if the script was better.  The blond is built but you won't mistake her for Lana Turner.So, if you want to see Film Noir, for heaven's sake, get Out Of The Past.  If for some reason you want a modern slant, try Cast A Deadly Spell or Witch Hunt.  But if you've already seen these and want to see some actors smoking a lot of cigarettes and trying very hard to be cool, its fairly entertaining.

The ten thumbs of each of several studio execs leave their prints all over this thing. A good movie will transcend any particular age group.  This one doesn't.

Farscape and Firefly at least went on to finish off the end with movies but poor Stargate Universe, one of the most promising Stargate's I felt, was left to die off into nothing.Anyhow, it took a couple of episodes to get into this but afterward I was hooked

I watched all the episodes on Netflix but had to come to Amazon for the movie and it was worth spending the money.This series is unlike anything I had seen before, kind of like what X-files was when it first started

This is among my favorite TV series and I was very happy it came to a close the way it did, very fitting.

$review_text.: RIO GRANDE(1950)---John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Victor McLaglen, Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr., Claude Jarman, Jr., Chill Wills, J. Carroll NaishThe last film in John Ford's "cavalry trilogy" and, IMO, the best of the three. John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara are one of the great "screen teams" and they are in top form here. Wayne is "Lt. Col. Yorke", O'Hara is "Kathleen", his estranged wife, and Jarman is their son, who has enlisted in the Army and has been posted to his father's command. O'Hara has accompanied Jarman to his posting hoping to persuade his father to let her "buy out" his enlistment and return him to civilian life. To her chagrin, Jarman wants no part of that and refuses to allow it.The film is "classic Ford". The characters are developed slowly and fully and, as always, the location photography is stunning---the film was shot in Moab, Utah. There is plenty of action involving an Apache uprising. McLaglen is a delight as the "top kick" for Wayne's unit. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey, Jr., give fine performances. The scene where Johnson, Carey, and Jarman ride teams of horses bareback, "Roman style", is just incredible---especially so given the fact that each actor is doing his own riding---no stunt-doubles for any of them. Ben Johnson, who was a National Champion Rodeo Cowboy prior to entering films, is probably the best horseman to ever appear in the movies.Anyway, this is another movie that I would recommend very highly to any fan of westerns, John Ford, or John Wayne.

The film does a fair job explaining how Freddy Krueger changed from a regular guy to a horrible nightmare. For those who didn't see the original Freddy is a nightmare that manifests in the dreams of teenagers and hurts them enough where the damage shows upon awakening. It's worth a look for horror fans but don't expect too much. The budget for this was $35M and it made a bit over $115M at the Box Office.

$REVIEW.: Although I am an outsider, I have read extensively over the past fifteen years about the Old Order Amish. "The Shunning" is an excellent and for the most part accurate portrayal of Amish life as it really is. All the major characters are believable. And the story itself is fast-moving, gripping, and heartwarming. (The one little quibble I have is that it is possible to take away from the story that marriages in the Amish community are arranged or practically arranged, as Katie's [Danielle Panabaker] proposed marriage seems to be. Based on the research I have done, I do not believe that this is typically the case.)Unlike some reviewers, who have stated that the ending leaves us hanging, I found the scene at the bus stop, when Katie is on her way to search for her birth mother, to be a perfect way to bring the story to a close. This story is primarily about Katie and her relationship with the adoptive family that has raised her since infancy, and in particular the break (and resultant shunning) that takes place when she finds out the secret her family has hidden from her all these years. The story is not about whether or not she reconnects with her birth mom. The fact that we never find this out is not relevant. Whether or not the rift with her family (particularly her father) is healed is what is crucial. The touching last scene at the bus stop deals with this, and is a perfect ending to the movie.

EXCALIBUR is the finest Arthur film of them all.  Forget KING ARTHUR, forget FIRST KNIGHT or even CAMELOT, THIS IS THE ONE.  A wonderful cast, including a young Helen Murren as Morgana, Nigel Terry as Arthur.  Best performance has to be Nicol Williamson as Merlin.  Look for a pre-Picard Patrick Stewart.  Beautifully filmed with a truly majestic score, the only film of this type to come close is probably Richard Donner's LADYHAWKE.

$REVIEW.: This is Rowan Atkinson's best leading role, not that this is saying very much.  However, Rowan Atkinson's character is a good-natured buffoon that tries his best, which is a separation from the more selfish character of Mr. Bean.  However, it's impossible to have a complete separation, and we see a lot of skits that Atkinson has already done multiple times in other venues.Another weakness to this movie is that it is just another spy spoof, akin to the numerous Leslie Nielson movies we have all seen.  It is almost a believable plotline though, which would've made the movie a stronger satire, had not John Malkovich's role had not been so entirely unbelievable.  Needless to say, Malkovich took a weak character and made him worse, and his performance was enough to keep me from wanting to see this movie again.But there are some very funny scenes that make this movie very fun.  There's a hilarious chase scene, along with a series of funny scenes at the headquarters of the secret organization involving Atkinson that left me out of breath.  Atkinson's brilliance along with strong support from the rest of the cast (minus Malkovich) make this movie a worthwhile trip, as long as you keep your expectations low.

You can forget the rest of the plot in this movie. It just seems to be an updated  riff on the Friday the 13th movies where you get to see teenagers killed in a variety of imaginative ways.

$review_text.: Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland are one of the best teams in movie history ranking with Laurel and Hardy, Irene Dunne and Cary Grant, and  Doris Day and Rock Hudson in terms of chemistry
Each were bursting with talent both musical and theatrical, so their films together jumped from the screen

Here are their four most popular and profitable ventures featuring excellent musical scores and simple stories about show business.Babes in Arms is notable as the first smash hit Garland and Rooney teaming
It was adapted from a stage play for the screen, and probably lost some appeal in the transition
What stands is an okay film with a great cast and some interesting musical numbers

A group of vaudevillians led by Joe Moran (Charles Winninger) are planning a big comeback to the stage, although vaudeville is losing its audience

Their kids want to help, but are brushed away
Moran's son Mickey (Mickey Rooney) brings the kids together to perform their own show and to prove to the adults that they can hold their own on a stage


Mickey's girl Patsy (Judy Garland) intends to play the lead, but Mickey thinks "Baby Rosalie" (June Preisser) might draw a bigger audience


And they have to battle Mrs
Steele (Margaret Hamilton) who wants to put them all into school.With lots of notable songs like "Good Morning," in its best form here with the jazz stylings of Garland's vocals and Rooney's piano playing, it's the catchiest song of the film
Most of the others are medleys with good and bad parts


Betty Jaynes and Douglas McPhail sing a few songs in their operatic style, which will be less appealing to mass audiences

The blackface routine might offend some audiences today, but it is really a tribute to the minstrel shows that Mickey's father started his career in

Rooney does an impression of Eddie Cantor in blackface, and also his impersonation of Clark Gable and Lionel Barrymore


However, none of the medleys have the energy that most Garland/Rooney numbers have, so they disappoint, possibly because the spotlight is shared with the lesser talented members of the cast.Strike Up the Band is an outstanding musical about a group of kids who adore music

Jimmy Connors (Rooney) loves playing the drums, so much so that he scorns girls and goes against his mother's ambitions for him to become a doctor
He ropes a bunch of his friend into forming an orchestra, something more fun than just the school band, and recruits Mary for a singer (Garland)

Mary is in love with Jimmy, but he has no time for women, even though a new girl in town (Preisser) tries to change his mind.The music in this film is a lot of fun

"Our Love Affair" is a cute song, but it features an absolutely strange presentation of animated fruit playing instruments


This segment was done by uncredited animator George Pal
Very early in the movie is the famous "The Conga" number, a high energy exhibition of one of the eras dance crazes
No matter how many times you see clips of this number in documentaries, it never gets old, and that is thanks to the boundless energy of Rooney and Garland who just leap from the screen

The next best song is performed at a party; Garland sings "Let the Drummer Boy Play" while Rooney goes crazy on the drums
Some people might be a bit put off by how over the top Rooney is in these sorts of movies, but he's so lovable that even if he looks ridiculous, you can't help but laugh and enjoy it


The finale is somewhat of a letdown, though it does include medleys of the previously performed songs which saves it, but "Strike up the Band" is far too tame to end such a great film.In Babes on Broadway, Rooney plays a guy who feels it is his destiny to make it big on Broadway


Although Garland has similar ambitions, she is not willing to step on other people to get what she wants

The two team up to start their own musical extravaganza to raise money for some poor children to visit the country, a dream that though promised has never materialized


With lots of talent in their hands but many problems to face, they unravel a simple but fun story.Garland is at her most beautiful in this film, a true joy to watch
Seeing this film would make you think she'd be soon jumping into films as a romantic lead, not struggling to grow up on the screen
Her magical voice was both an asset and her downfall; it kept her typecast in sunny musicals
Rooney is a ball of energy as always, but somehow even moreso than ever
His impression of Carmen Miranda is very funny


His love for showing off is really catching, like a puppy doing tricks

Virginia Weidler does a good job as well as a secondary character and Ray McDonald does a great job dancing
Busby Berkeley directs the musical numbers, which is obvious by some of the overhead shots and the choreography.Finally we have Girl Crazy, the story of a playboy Danny (Mickey Rooney) from New York whose father has had enough of his behavior

He is sent to an all boy's school out in the west where the boys get up promptly at 5:45, rarely shower, and find solace in riding horses all day

Danny certainly doesn't fit in, but he finds he can't complain too much thanks to the presence of Ginger (Judy Garland), the Dean's grand daughter and one of the prettiest girls he's ever seen


When the school is threatened to close, the two join up to find a way to save it.Rooney is a barrel of fun in this film; his energy is contagious

He's hamming it up in every scene, especially in the "I Got Rhythm" finale
Although he isn't the most handsome of men, he really pulls off being a charming ladies' man, much like he was in life at this time
Garland is breathtakingly gorgeous throughout the film


Her natural charms, heartbreaking voice, and gentle sweetness add up for an amazing character and performance

June Allyson makes her first appearance in an opener that catches the attention quite well


She seems confident, but it is interesting to know that after each song she had to sing on a film, she threw up in the bathroom.The songs in this film were later compiled for the musical Crazy For You
The lyrics were changed slightly to fit the altered plot, so if one is familiar with that show, it is interesting to see this film too.There is a bonus disk of materials to supplement the commentaries, short subjects, and radio presentations on the movie disks
Here we find Rooney's interview with Robert Osbourne on TCM's Private Screenings, Rooney and Garland movie trailers, and Garland's songbook, a compilation of songs from Judy's career in films.The packaging for this DVD is absolutely wonderful

There are three sections in the box

The first contains the disks for the four films


My only complaint is that they are stacked on top of each other, which can be mildly annoying
However, the booklet features great photo collages for each Rooney and Garland


The second section in the box is a folder of stills from the making of the films; it is an excellent bonus for fans

Each photo is interesting and most are uncommon


The third section contains the bonus features DVD with a booklet of information about each of the film including scene selections and supplemental materials.This set is perfect for musical lovers, teens looking for more wholesome entertainment, or classic movie fans who can't get enough of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland.

 I rented this DVD more out of curiosity to see what all the &quot;hub-bub&quot; was about over this movie


 Well, it was a good movie; lots of action, a good story, great filming, but I am so tired of people saying that the books in the LOTR trilogy are the greatest pieces of literature ever to grace the printed page and that this movie is the greatest film ever made

 Get a life!  It's a movie, folks
 Agreed, a good movie, but JUST a movie
 I must admit, some parts of this movie I found a bit boring
 The movie really got cooking after about 1 1/2 hour, but the first part did seem to drag a little bit
 The acting was good overall


 Anyway, please don't send me hate mail over this

 I respect all the people that really love this movie and the books

 In fact, I am going to start reading the LOTR trilogy today just out of curiosity to see how different the book is from the movie and to see what happens to these interesting characters

There are a few truly precious lines in this one.. like when the guy in the cafe says how would you like your eggs? bogie says overeasy.. and the guy (who is wearing a classic diner uniform complete with that silly pointed hat) says 'easy does it'..i guess you had to be there... sorry.. this is what black and white films are about.. oh yeah there is another sequence when bogie is getting plastic surgery and he is having this surreal drug induced dream sequence where the doctor says in a very funny voice - i'm going to make you look like a bull and stretches his cheeks out.. very hard to explain but very hilarious in a campy sort of way..
$SUMMARY.: pure campy film noir

$review_text.: My wife brought this home and I went into it expecting NOT to like it at all.  I mean, let's be honest, it sounds silly and I absolutely can't stand Tim Burton films.  After we finished, we were both surprised at how much we enjoyed it!!  In fact, it's one of the better movies I've seen in a while.  Now, I have not read the book and I saw a couple of reviews on here that 1 starred it for not following the book word for word.  Not sure I agree with that, but to each his own.About the movie:The action sequences were amazing; the sets & costumes were excellent; the special effects were top notch; the story was quite good with great acting.  What more do you want in a movie?  The people who are going to like this movie are going to be those who enjoy action/graphic horror movies with great special effects.  If you are a 'Bridges Over Madison County' or 'Sex in the City' kind of person then this probably isn't for you!  In fact, if you are a man and can say you enjoy the 2 movies I just mentioned, you might want to think about having that surgical procedure to have your nads removed....  but I digress....Oh yeah...you want to spend the extra $ and rent it on blu-ray if you have a nicer tv and sound system.  The blu-ray really takes advantage of the cinematography and great sound in the movie.  Enjoy!!

$review_text.: This is a gorgeous instructional DVD, and a pleasure on every level

Matthew Cohen's instruction is clear and simple, with never a wasted word, and yet he never sounds like he's dumbing-down his insights into this profound and at times esoteric practice

And -- joy! -- his voice is calm and relaxing


Both practices (about 40 minutes total each) end with a seated meditation, and I only wish those meditations were longer
Both practices also have chapter headings for skipping around, though I've never been tempted to do so.What I most enjoy about this is the thought that went into the production
The stunning outdoor setting somehow enhances the simplicity of the practices
Using voice-over instruction, Cohen performs both practices with another instructor; her equally calm presence and mirroring offers the eye and mind another place to learn from and study


Every visual detail seems to have been considered in advance
To name just two: i) the timing of the day (stunning morning light for the Fire practice; dusk-evening light for the more calming Water practice), and ii) crane shots that enhance the instruction by letting us see different angles than would be available to us if we were standing directly in front


Some 'jazzy' quick cutting here and there (the disc has a couple of free-form practice demonstration chapters separate from the instruction), but overall the artistic direction is sophisticated, subtle and unobtrusive


I particularly like the music and sound effects in the Water section.One suggestion: keep the remote nearby at the end of the Water practice
You'll be in a mellow zone after the end of the meditation, and the music pops back on so quickly that it's kind of startling.Overall, my favorite Qi Gong DVD by far


Can't wait for more from this instructor.

$REVIEW.: 1.) John Cena and FBI (Johnny Stamboli and Chuck Palumbo) w/Nunzio vs Rhyno, Spanky, and Chris BenoitWhat a huge step down for Benoit. After being in Judgment Day classics with Jericho and Angle to being in the opening match with Spanky. Anyways, a quick opening match that ends with Palumbo getting the pin on Spanky following the Kiss of Death from Palumbo and Stamboli._________________________________________________________________________________________________A segment with Austin, Bischoff, and their waitress woman in the skybox_________________________________________________________________________________________________2.) La Resistance (Rene Dupree and Sylvan Grenier) vs Scott Steiner and Test w/Stacy KeiblerA decently good Tag Team match from both teams. This was Dupree and Grenier's PPV debut and they were certainly impressive in their first PPV match. La Resistance get the win after their Bonsoir double team move on Steiner. After the match, Stacy checks on Steiner but Test yanks her away from him, which would begin the Summer love triangle story between the 3_________________________________________________________________________________________________3.) WWE Tag Team Championship Ladder Match: Team Angle vs Eddie Guerrero and TajiriThis was a real treat, considering it had been quite awhile since we had seen a Tag Team championship Ladder Match on PPV. This match gets pretty violent at times and is overall just exhilarating. Eddie retrieves the titles in the end in what was no doubt a classic and forgotten gem._________________________________________________________________________________________________4.) WWE Intercontinental Championship Battle Royal: Val Venis vs Chris Jericho vs Goldust vs Lance Storm vs Rob Van Dam vs Christian vs Test vs Kane vs Booker TAfter the Intercontinental Championship had gone vacant many months prior, it was back up for grabs in this highly entertaining over the top rope battle royal. Everyone excluding Booker T was a former Intercontinental Champion, so it featured some of WWE's best Intercontinental Champions throwing down. Pat Patterson even sat ringside for the match. Booker T originally won the match but the referee had been knocked out, so it allowed Christian to sneak back in the ring (ala Stone Cold 1997 Royal Rumble), attack Booker with the title, and throw him out of the ring to win the match and the championship. Great match with a nice swerve at the end_________________________________________________________________________________________________5.) Bikini Contest: Torrie Wilson vs SableIf you ask me, this was probably one of the biggest reasons fans ordered this PPV. Sable had recently returned to the company after a near 4 year hiatus and got involved in a feud with Torrie Wilson over on Smackdown about who was the better Playboy Cover girl. I honestly didn't understand why guys were so head over heels for Sable when she came back in 2003. She had a horrendous plastic surgery and she looked....well....not as pretty as she did in the 90s to put it nicely. If you just look at this you'll see for yourself. Anyways, both divas strut their stuff and the winner would be determined with the most fan cheers. Sable gets the most cheers but Torrie strips off an extra layer that was much more revealing and Torrie wins the Bikini Contest. Following the contest, Torrie plants a kiss on Sable to ensure there were "no hard feelings"_________________________________________________________________________________________________6.) Rowdy Roddy Piper vs Mr. AmericaI remember this feud back in 2003. And even then and even now, this is one of the stupidest storylines in WWE history. Hulk Hogan playing his alter ego, Mr. America and Piper and McMahon trying to prove that Mr. America was Hulk Hogan. Mr. America said he wasn't Hogan, despite him using Hogan's theme and Hogan's moves. It was just a mess. Then Zach Gowen made his debut and got involved and then this horrible match happened. Everything about this storyline was just bad. This match was even worse. Hogan..er...umm...Mr. America puts us out of our misery with a leg drop on Piper close to the 5 minute mark for the win. Why were Hogan and Piper fighting in a match at this event anyway?? This was 2003, not 1985. Both Hogan and Piper were past their prime and out of shape. Horrible horrible horrible._________________________________________________________________________________________________7.) World Heavyweight Championship Match: Kevin Nash w/Shawn Michaels vs Triple H (c) w/Ric FlairBasic match that's not all that great to watch. Pretty much one-sided with Nash dominating Triple H the entire match throughout until Triple H gets DQ's hitting Earl Hebner in the heart with his sledgehammer. Triple H gets beaten some more and eventually Jackknifed through the announcer's table by Nash. It seemed that fans weren't very invested in Nash in 2003 like they were back in the 90s. But then again, he hadn't exactly been in the internet's good graces since WCW so it was understandable why he wasn't necessarily liked by many fans_________________________________________________________________________________________________A segment where Bischoff throws up out of the skybox and onto some fans below. Throughout the night there were some pointless but semi-comical segments with Bischoff and Austin where Austin forced Bischoff to overeat and overdrink, leading him to throw up everything he had consumed_________________________________________________________________________________________________8.) Women's Championship Fatal 4 Way Match: Trish Stratus vs Jacqueline vs Victoria vs Jazz (c)Short but sweet women's match. The Women's Division on Raw was shaping up to be pretty impressive around this time. Jazz was rising as probably WWE's top diva heel while Trish was WWE's top babyface diva while Lita was out with her neck injury. Jazz retains the title with a DDT on Jacqueline_________________________________________________________________________________________________9.) WWE Championship Stretcher Match: Big Show vs Brock Lesnar (c)This was the final match of the Brock Lesnar vs Big Show PPV trilogy and what a match it was. This was without a doubt their best match, compared to their Survivor Series and Royal Rumble battles. The storyline was intriguing as Big Show was wrecking havoc over on Smackdown and injuring superstars and putting them on stretchers. With Brock Lesnar being the only one big enough to stop him, their final one-on-one PPV score was settled in this awesome Stretcher Match.  In addition to the Bikini Contest, this was another must-see fans probably ordered for. Near the end, Lesnar drives a forklift to the ring and the fans go wild. In what was probably the moment of the night, Lesnar dives off the forklift into Big Show. Follow it up with a suplex and an F5, Lesnar rolls Show on the stretcher, positioned on the forklift, and drives the forklift/stretcher over the line to retain the title. No doubt, the match of the night and probably Lesnar and Show's greatest match against each other.Overall: A pretty poor Judgment Day if you ask me. The Tag Team Ladder Match, the Battle Royal, Bikini Contest, and main event are the only reasons to really watch this PPV. Everything else just sucked and was boring or didn't deliver enough. This would be the last Judgment Day PPV to be co-hosted by Raw and Smackdown as it would become exclusive to the Smackdown brand the following year

$REVIEW.: One Night Stand 2007When I bought this DVD the first thing I said to myself after it was done was "UGH". Seriously, I hadn't been this disappointed with a WWE PPV since No Way Out 2002. I just felt that there was way too much controversy surrounding this PPV and it added up to a lackluster show that ends with a little bit of a smack to the face. For me, One Night Stand was supposed to be one of 2 ECW events of the year and after the poor December 2 Dismember a few months prior, things could only go up from there. I never knew I could be more wrong.So I mentioned there were controversies surrounding this PPV and here they are. Controversy #1, Rob Van Dam's last match in WWE... with Randy Orton???? OK, so I get it "The Legend Killer" and what not but I'll go there, Randy Orton does not impress me as a wrestler. The guy's technical skills are adequate at best and you'd think with the style mismatch we'd at least get a little entertainment. Not to mention this match is a Stretcher Match! When I think of RVD and Stretcher Matches, I think RVD v Sabu. A highly physical match up that goes above and beyond the limits of imagination. This Stretcher Match doesn't even come close. Terry Funk was once quoted as saying, "The best way to go out, is on your back". If that was the case, RVD went out upside down because it's such an awkward feeling watching that because for those of us who've seen RVD really go full throttle we know that the man can get it done and to watch him go out like this almost feels insulting.Speaking of insults, Controversy #2... Vince McMahon defends the ECW World Heavyweight Championship against Bobby Lashley (w/ the helpf of Shane McMahon and Umaga). First and foremost, WHAT THE HELL? Vinny Mac the ECW Champ? OK so I will admit that Vince has taken some brutal beatings from Austin, HHH, Undertaker and others but is Vince "hardcore"? Survey says..... NO! If you ask me this match is no better than an over-hyped squash. Not to mention with Lashley's amateur background you'd think he'd be an amazing chain wrestler but NO. He ends up being your "A" typical strong man wrestler. So not only do we have a squash we, have BOREDOM. Wonderful (sorry, sarcasm doesn't come across as funny when it's written).I will say that even with those 2 major problems, there are flashes of  brilliance in the 6-Man Tables Match between the team of Tommy Dreamer, Sandman and CM Punk v Elijah Burke, Matt Striker and Marcus Cor Van (ugh, seriously why can't we just call him Monty Brown?). Sure this match wasn't nearly as crazy as other Tables matches but for what it was, it was entertaining. Personally if this match had been an Elimination Tables Match it probably would've gotten over more but again, take it as it is.The other shot of brilliance was the Tornado Tag Ladder Match between The Hardys and Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas. I've always been a fan of Shelton's (go Gophers!) and the guy can put on a show when it comes to Ladder matches. I just love watching these 4 take the risks that they do in this match. Sure Charlie Haas doesn't take the same kind of risks that Matt, Jeff and Shelton do but the guy can take some punishment. If you ask me, this was probably the best match of the night. Then again, there was that Extreme Lumberjack Match between Kane and Mark Henry (again, more sarcasm).So overall, this PPV to me is a 1  star PPV (but closer to 1). PASS. No question about it, PASS. I'd like to say that there are some redeeming factors to One Night Stand 07 but there's really not. To only have 2 somewhat entertaining matches on card is plain out pathetic. That's like end of the line WCW like. I really hate to dog this PPV so bad but I don't want anyone else to have the same disappointment I had when I watched this PPV.

$review_text.: The next best thing to being there - and I've wanted to "be there" for nearly forty years! Missed this tour (sold out before I even found out about the date, and actually had tickets for the aborted Schenker-Roth-West tour!) Michael's concert dvd output has been as sketchy as his up and down career, so I approached this new one with a little trepidation. But WOW! WOW! WOW! In fact, I tried to form the word WOW several times watching this incredible show but couldn't due to my jaw continually dropping to the floor. At sixty years of age, Michael's playing now is not only unbelievable, but at some points on this show even better than the old days. It's all there (again): the dexterity, the tone, the phrasing, the melodic structure of the solos, the fills. The playing here rivals even "Strangers in the Night", generally considered one of UFO's finest performances as well as one of the great 70's live albums - and in light of the rumors that that album is a bit of a cut-and-paste affair, this performance is particularly amazing). 'Rock Bottom', though, is the album highlight, Michael's solo slowly building to a crescendo of speed and precision that literally left me wanting to get up off the couch and bow to the TV. Another highlight of the dvd is the fact that the drumming and bass duties are handled by two of the original Scorpions members (original if you don't count "Lonesome Crow", that is), so it's nice to hear Michael rip into all the songs he recorded with them for the "Lovedrive" album. Other than that, it's pretty evenly divided between Michael's solo material, UFO songs and a couple of tunes from the new album. But, it's Michael's playing throughout this show that is simply stunning, and his return to form is revelatory. Additionally, the sound quality (5.1 DTS!!!) is just fantastic!! Don't miss this!

$REVIEW.: A true judge-by-its-cover comedy, this is almost precisely what you'd expect from the trailer and/or promotional materials, for better or for worse. It's a light, predictable comedy with a few good laughs and a wealth of filler material. Although Steve Buscemi and Jim Carrey appear in supporting roles, the spotlight is largely reserved for Steve Carell, who's merely okay as an out-of-touch, egomaniacal Las Vegas magician. Carrey is particularly wasted in his role, a Criss Angel-David Blaine hybrid that amounts to little more than a barbed punchline, and doesn't even receive the dignity of an endgame. The film is at its most entertaining when Carell is insufferable, a snobby celebrity lost in his own self-image, but quickly loses steam when Carrey's grim not-quite-magic act forces him to wake up. The plot becomes fairly paint-by-numbers from there, with a tour of skid row and a telegraphed love interest (Olivia Wilde) lining Wonderstone's path to redemption, and navigates no sharp turns on its way to an empty happy ending. A good time-killer for a lazy weeknight, but not something I'd want to recommend to friends.

$REVIEW.: Where in the item description does it say that there are only 11 episodes selected by Acorn Media? Are we supposed to know that since there are 11 CDs there are only 11 episodes? Even the outside of the packaging does not reveal how few episodes await within.I found out about this series on YouTube and purchased this &#8220;collection&#8221; to fill in the gaps created by missing episodes on YouTube. What a disappointment to me when I discovered all the missing episodes on these CDs. In addition, Acorn Media denies you complete control over the the CD&#8217;s contents. On the 1st, I could not skip their advertisements for all the other wonderful British series they offer (but probably only selected episodes.) The only way to skip to a point where you left-off is to increase the speed from 1X to 8X and race forward until you recognize the scene where you had paused watching. There is no comprehensive menu either.So, I believe that the description is misleading and constitutes false advertising. Do not buy this and perhaps other Acorn Media series unless you are sure of the actual contents you are purchasing. It would be much better if Amazon could offer all the episodes in this series at their normally reasonable prices. I have no understanding of the huge number of rave reviews. I too think that this is a magnificent series, but it is hard to rave when you have been screwed. I will now try and return this purchase to Amazon.

$review_text.: Some films are so raw and so real that they tend to break your heart more so than others.  `Ponette' is one of those films.The film is pretty simple in scope.  Young Ponette is in a car accident with her mother.  She walks away with a broken arm, but her mother loses her life.  The film basically follows Ponette as she learns to grapple with the fact that she will never see her mother again.  She becomes rather reclusive and aggressive and defensive.  She fights her depression and her grief the only way she knows how.  She isn't yet old enough to learn balance and so she dwells in her pain and sorrow almost constantly.  Her young friends try to help her (sometimes) and the adults in her life try their best to console her, but in the end Ponette has to discover for herself just how to be happy.I want to say this up front.  Some have criticized the depiction of Ponette's father in the film, stating that he is cruel for the way he reacts to Ponette's longing for her mother.  I don't agree with this.  I don't feel he was a cruel man at all.  He was emotionally crushed by the loss of his wife and the realization that he was going to have to raise this little girl all on his own.  He was angry with his wife for leaving him alone.  He missed her, he longed for her, but he knew that he couldn't show that because he had to be strong for Ponette.  It's only natural for the man to feel as though he must hide his feelings in order to take care of those around him.  If he were to grieve, who would console his daughter?  Sure, he snaps at her and calls her crazy, but this is out of frustration and not something he is proud of.I completely understand that overwhelming feeling to `fix' everything.This film, while simple, becomes so much more thanks to a stunning performance given by 4-year-old Victoire Thivisol.  Yes, I said 4-years-old!  In fact, this performance is SO good that I'm tempted to call it the best of the 90's.  Everything feels nature coming from her.  Every tear, every outburst, every solemn stare; you can't help but feel it in your gut.  Having a 3-year-old at home, I can see so much of her in this performance and so it speaks to my heart.It's a performance you have to see to believe, honestly.In the end, this is a film I highly recommend.  It is a French film, so be forewarned that there are subtitles (something that has NEVER bothered me, but I understand that it deters some) but the language spoken by this young girl's face breaks all barriers.  This is a beautifully moving film about the bond formed between mother and daughter and the strength it takes to `learn to be happy'.

$REVIEW.: Vincent Price. A haunted mansion house. Spooky caretakers. And a giant pile of money to any of the guests who lives through the night. What's not to love?"The House on Haunted Hill" is one of those rare horror movies that seems as fresh as if it were made yesterday. The script is clever, the acting is solid, and while the direction is a bit on the hammy side, the plot is clever enough to keep viewers riveted until the final twist. It's horror, myster and dark comedy all in one.Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) decides to host a macabre birthday party for his devious wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), in the "House on Haunted Hill." He invites a test pilot, a columnist, a secretary and the house's unbalanced owner, and offers each one ten thousand dollars if they stay all night. Chandeliers fall, doors slam shut, and they get to see the wine vat full of acid.But as the night goes on, poor Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig) begins to see specters and rotted heads. The others think she's hysterical -- until Annabelle is found hanging in the hallway, dead. The unfortunate guests start to suspect that Loren brought them there to murder them (except for the owner, who blames ghosts). But the truth is far more complex and sinister....William Castle made a lot of slightly kitschy horror movies like "13 Ghosts" and "The Tingler," but this clever twist on haunted-house movies is probably his best work ever. Okay, that dancing skeleton is unintentionally funny, as is the gliding crone. But most of the time, it provides some in-your-face chills and great work from Price.This movie has solid dialogue ("Do you remember the fun we had when you poisoned me?") and some truly wicked exchanges between Price and Ohmart, as spouses who completely loathe one another. Castle's weird sense of humor shows up in the coffin-shaped boxes, the vat of acid, and the organ playing itself.But the most impressive aspect of "House" is that it's not just another ghosts-terrify-screaming-idiots movie. It's more of a mystery, before the crime is committed. We're never quite sure if there really are ghosts haunting the place, or if the humans are the ones who are really causing all this trouble. What's really scary is that the humans are more frightening.Vincent Price is definitely the star here -- creepy, intelligent, debonair, and he has an acid comment for every occasion ("Don't stay up thinking of ways to get rid of me. It makes wrinkles"). Ohmart runs a close second with her seductive, devious trophy wife; the other actors do solid jobs as well, although Craig doesn't do much except shriek periodically."House on Haunted Hill" is a deserving vintage horror movie -- a twisty plot, and Price at his finest. A must-see.

$REVIEW.: Though alot of the laughs here are scattershot, on the whole this is a thoroughly enjoyable bedroom farce.  The film is not without it's flaws namely overlength, Peter Sellers at times seems to be channeling his Dr. Strangelove character in his portrayal of psychiatrist Dr. Fassbender, and writer Woody Allen's dweeby character seems an unlikely associate of Peter O'Toole's lothario.  The film's virtues include O'Toole's account of a womanizer trying to reform his ways.  O'Toole has a deft touch for the broad comedy he's asked to tackle here.  Romy Schneider is effervescent as the woman O'Toole is trying to settle down with.  It goes without saying that Paula Prentiss, Capucine, and Ursula Andress are stunning as the women who throw themselves at O'Toole despite his resistance.  Great mod feel here(love the cars and costumes).  Catchy Burt Bacharach-Hal David score including the memorable title tune.  Great title sequence.

$REVIEW.: Or words to that effect; I think it was Woody Allen  who said that. and Forrest Gump embodies the "Just turn up" principle; that is pretty much the only "point" to this film.There does not seem to be any statement in this film that Forrest has a purpose. He just follows his nose, and things happen. Maybe if more people did this, they might enjoy what they have in life, and get more out of the precious moments we have in life.Without a doubt, this film is superbly entertaining. If you have a good script, and a Great cast, then all you need is a Zemeckis to create visually good material, and masterful special  effects  to back it all up.The end result is that a very moving, dramatic, funny, and ultimately emotional film will result.if you find something deep and meaningful in this film, then good for you, and if you find something else in this film, I would question why you would watch a film; at its heart, this film is superbly crafted. It cannot but be with the people who created this work.The imposed meanings that some reviewers assert tell more about the reviewers than they do about the film.Highly recommended as great entertainment.

$review_text.: I liked this one better than the first one because it's funnier and a much better plot


And plus It's got most of the villains from the cartoon on it like..
Pterodactyl, The Black Knight Ghost, The Skeleton Men, Zombie, Captain Cutler, Miner 49er, The Tar Monster, The 10,000 Volt Ghost, and The Cotton Candy Glob which was not on the cartoon..

I wonder why
Now the person who brings all those villains to life is an evil masked figure who could be Dr


Johnathin Jacobo, Old Man Wickles, or Patrick

And all of the costumes are in a museum which Patricks made with the exhibits


It's up to Mystery Inc to stop this masked figure and his monsters
And this time Fred is a better leader, Daphne is tougher, Velma is smarter, Shaggy is Shaggier, and Scooby is Scoobier
YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FILM!

$REVIEW.: Peter Cushing is at the top of his game in &quot;The Curse Of Frankenstein&quot;, the very first Hammer horror picture!  And certainly one of the two BEST -- right up there with &quot;Horror Of Dracula&quot;, which was released a short time after &quot;Curse&quot;, and also starring these two legends of the horror genre: Mr
Cushing and Christopher Lee


 Lee speaks not a word in The Curse Of Frankenstein, but nonetheless makes a strong impact as the monster created by Cushing
 A solid supporting cast is on hand here as well, along with good atmospheric sets

I believe this to be one of the truly greatest horror films ever produced!  And it started the classic teaming of Lee and Cushing

 This one's got a darn good closing shot, too -- as Cushing is sent off to face the ultimate punishment
 For a fan of horror pictures, this one is 83 minutes of pure pleasure!

$review_text.: Paris, 1931. Hugo Cabret is a young boy living in Gare Montparnasse, a railway station. He has no family and is trying to salvage parts to fix an automaton, believing it contains a message from his late father. Constantly hunted by the Station Inspector (who delights in finding orphan boys and sending them to the orphanage) and thwarted by a toy stall owner who takes his father's notebook, Hugo's quest seems doomed...until he discovers another piece of the puzzle.Hugo is director Martin Scorsese's tribute and love letter to the pioneering days of the cinema. The director's first family film and his first movie made in 3D, it's a bit of a new direction for him but also one that he embraces. Hugo is vibrant, colourful, entertaining and amusing, let down only by a slightly excessive running time.The movie hinges on the central performance of Hugo and actor Asa Butterfield (best known for playing the young Mordred in the British TV series Merlin) does great work in the role, nailing the loneliness of the young boy looking for a place in the world. Chlo Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass, Let Me In) is equally capable in the role of Isabelle, a young girl who befriends Hugo and encourages his quest. Older, more established actors like Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee also bring their A-games to the movie, with Kingsley particularly successful in his role as real-life movie pioneer Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s. Arguably the biggest revelation is Sacha Baron Cohen, who leaves behind his increasingly predictable comedic roles (though not entirely his comedic talents) in the role of the Station Inspector, initially presented as a straightforward antagonist who becomes more nuanced as the film progresses.Visually, the film is a delight. Scorsese uses a combination of sets, CGI and illustrations to create a vivid, exaggerated version of the real world. Scorsese makes the slightly 'false' look of CGI into a virtue, using it imaginatively and contrasting it against the much more primitive effects of early 20th Century cinema, but which were equally groundbreaking in their day. Scorsese is well-known as a film historian and a keen preserver of old movies as well as a director, and he combines these interests with a solid storyline (adapted from an award-winning book by Brian Selznick) to create a film that is close to his heart. Crucially, however, he prevents the film from tipping into self-indulgence by ensuring that these elements are driven by the story rather than any kind of lecturing.Where the film stutters is its pacing. For a film meant to appeal to children as well as adults, the two-hour running time is a bit long for such a slight story, especially one where the writer and director have to keep contriving dramatic situations out of misunderstandings which could be solved in a single line of dialogue (why does Hugo never tell Georges that the notebook is his father's? Why doesn't he tell the Inspector that Georges is now looking after him?). This problem is accentuated by the presence of under-developed sideplots, such as the Inspector's faltering attempts to romance a flowergirl (a heavily under-used Emily Mortimer), Christopher Lee's lack of screentime and an amusing but very slight storyline involving two station workers (Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour). Perhaps expanding these storylines and dropping some of the repetitiveness of the main storyline might have been a better idea and could have filled the running-time more effectively.Still, despite this problem Hugo (****) is visually arresting and well-directed, with some educational value regarding the early days of cinema and some excellent use of emotion without descending into mawkishness (one shudders to think what an off-form Spielberg would have made of this script).

$REVIEW.: *Note: This was originally written as a review on iTunes, where the overwhelmingly large number of 5-star reviews were just too much to sit idly by.*Yes, I am 21, but High School Musical (and especially it's successor) was a movie with a lot of heart, with a soundtrack full of catchy replayable tunes.  They say this is for the "older" crowed, that HSM is too "tween" and that TAM is edgier and more mature - well that ain't true.  Unlike High School Musical's, these songs are empty and hollow, the most generic music I've heard in a very long while.  I didn't think vocals could get worse than Hudgens' (who actually improved on the second soundtrack) but Nina Dobrev's - and the rest of the cast for that matter - is nothing but horrid, synthesized drivel.  And there's no one with anywhere close to the vocal prowess of Lucas Grabeel on this album anywhere.  It's a shame the only one with apparent true vocal talent, Neil Haskell, only got 3 stanzas of solo music in the entire score.As for the movie itself, it's highly contrived, and really, really boring.  Nina Dobrev's acting is no better than it is on Degrassi - which is horrible (her acting, not the show), for those not with the program.  The musical numbers have horrible segways, coming from out of nowhere, and "Survivor" is a complete music-video of a mess.  The cinematography and editing are admitably decent, but is that really important when everything else is screwed up so horribly wrong?  The entire ensemble cast is bland, and although I love So You Think You Can Dance's Neil Haskell, his sidekick role could never be good enough to hold me to a movie this bad.  Speaking of So You Think You Can Dance, it's sad that the only reason I was able to wade through the film was catching tiny glimpses here and there of dancers who had been on the show this season (Matt, Thayne, Gev, Kelli, Bayli (Kelli's sister, also Bonnie Story's daughter)).  For even the most diehard fans of the dance reality show, it's not worth it.  Trust me.Comparing "Work It Out" to "At The Mall" (whose lyrics go something like "at the mall, ooooh at the mall") or "Gotta Go My Own Way" to "A Little Bit of Heart Somewhere" (hey sugar hey sugar hey, don't care what you say...") seems like no contest.  Yet there's hundreds of people who attest that this is better than High School Musical.  Everyone has their own opinions and prefrences, but when something so blatantly bland and horrible is said to be better than something with a lot of heart, I get pretty darn confused.  Did we watch the same film?  Are we reviewing the same thing here?

 Actually, they rise as early as dusk


 They avoid sunlight
 They live in darkness and filth with cobwebs, spiders, and rats running around
 They sleep in coffins, in crypts, sometimes in castles

 They're evil

 They're scary


 They're everyone's worst nightmare


 They appear in such movies as:Nosferatu (1922)Dracula (1931)Horror of Dracula (1958)Brides of Dracula (1960)Black Sunday (1960)Vampire Circus (1972)Dan Curtis' Dracula (1973)Count Dracula (1977)Dracula (1979)Salem's Lot (1979)Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)And many more.I had to see Twilight (2008) to see what all the Hype HYpe HYPe HYPE is about


 I don't get it


 On the other hand, I DO get it


 This is a movie for teenagers, especially teen girls and pre-teens

 It's mostly a romance movie


 From a bee-bop-a-lulu standpoint (translation: from a teen romance standpoint), the movie works

 But it has a total disregard for what vampires actually are and what they do


 It borrows the basic vampire concept, but has the vampires walking around in broad daylight, attending school, playing baseball, etc
 This is ridiculous and laughable

 This movie is unintentionally funny


 I found myself laughing most of the movie


 This movie is an insult to classic vampire stories, their authors, and classic vampire movies as a whole

 Even the plot is laughable

 It's funny to watch this teen guy vampire watch the girl he has his eyes on
 He's creepy and weird


 Also, the makeup used is horrendous


 The special effects are OK, nothing great.One positive about the movie is the overall atmosphere.If you're somebody who respects the classic vampire, the stories, the authors, and the classic vampire movies, then steer clear of this movie and its sequels, unless of course you're in the mood for a few laughs.

$review_text.: Batman fans have been waiting a long time for a really awesome Batman movie, and well, the wait is finally over. Seven years after the franchise was nearly ruined by Joel Schumacher's attempt to make Batman "family friendly", ace director Christopher Nolan along with comic-nerd screenwiter David S. Goyer wipe the slate clean and go back to the drawing board. What they've come up with is a brilliant comic book movie. Batman Begins is so good in fact that it even blows aways last year's excellent Spider-Man 2. This is simply an Oscar-worthy movie. It may be a little far-fetched for a superhero movie to be up for Best Picture consideration, but if ever a superhero movie had a chance, Batman Begins is certainly it. Never before has the character seemed so real and believable as he does in this movie, and never before has the audience been so motivated to care about him. Never before have we had an actor of Christian Bale's caliber in the role of Bruce Wayne. With a supporting cast that includes Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, how can you lose? With a brilliant director like Christopher Nolan at the helm, you can't.The film explores the origins of the character and, for the first time in a Batman movie, actually gives us a plausible reason for a grown man to put on a costume and mask and fight crime. The movie makes the character seem less silly and more believable. For the first time, we get a true portrait of Bruce Wayne: a haunted, bitter man who is angry at the world around him yet wants to make it better at the same time. Batman Begins delves deeper in the psychology of a "super hero" than any movie of its sort ever has before. Less believable is the second-half plot in which Scarecrow (the excellent Cillian Murphy) wants to spread a fear-inducing drug through Gotham City's water supply. However, the story is so well conceived and executed that you won't mind its far-fetched aspects.Batman Begins should certainly solidify Christopher Nolan's status as one of the finest young directors in the business today. He made a seldom seen yet impressive debut (1998's Following), followed by a crime-thriller masterpiece (2001's Memento), then a superb psychological thriller (2002's Insomnia), now he presents a stunning comic book movie to re-energize a dying franchise. I do eagerly await Nolan's next project, nearly as much as I await Quentin Tarantino's and P.T. Anderson's.Batman Begins was not only probably the best movie of this past summer, it is one of the best movies of the year.

To its benefit, its keeps you interested throught and you do develop a strong interest in how the characters and particularly the story will evolve.  There are many unexpected moments and several surprising turns and ultimately the message that the story is trying to convey is achieved.  However, personally I like movies that have tidy endings and this one did not, consequently it rates only 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: Home Theatre is becoming more common each day and buying the right DVD for your system is most important. The movie is the main ingredient/bottom line to all this equipment! Being a videophile I am obsessed in getting the best quality picture and sound available! So my reviews will concentrate on the total DVD package.TOTAL RECALL is my (#2nd) Home Theatre DVD Review. This is the movie's second release and the first was fair but they got it right on this &quot;Special Limited Edition&quot;.Now this DVD is Digitally ReMastered (Picture &amp; Sound). It is enhanced for Widescreen (16:9 Aspect Ratio) TV's &amp; HDTV's. The movies picture is one of the best (sharpest clarity) I've ever seen on home DVD. NOTE: 480p = 480 horizontal lines (Digital) of Progressive Scan (p) - which is basically a line doubler and using COMPONENT VIDEO cable for the best picture quality. Regular DVD players have 480i = 480 horizontal lines (Analog) and use either COMPOSITE or S-VIDEO Cables. For more information see my SD-6200 &amp; MV3CV-2M reviews.Simply put this is a scifi Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie of the highest quality (special effects, story line, casting &amp; color). He is caught between a boring life and the strange desire to be an action hero on Mars. He sees a TV ad referring to a brain implant journey to Mars. This is the latest Travel scheme fad of the time. A mental exercise in time and space. (pretty clever huh?) The name of the company is &quot;Rekall&quot;. This is just the beginning of a great DVD journey!!!! (Parental Guidance required - some graphic violence and mutant make-up).The colors are absolutely beautiful, so vivid. The Sound is so crystal clear. (5.1)Extras are abundant and delightful including a Commentary Track with Schwarzeneggers many fond memories. This DVD is a great value and total eye &amp; ear candy!!!!

$REVIEW.: 10/02/06 Surprisingly enough, I received a personal e-mail from Waner Brothers Home Video, explaining the Mama's Family situation

 Now, I am very disappointed that this is an edited, watered down, syndicated version of the first season, but Warner Brothers has informed me that they do not own the rights to the first run episodes that were aired on NBC in the early eighties, only the syndicated versions that have been shown on TBS and more recently the i network


 My response to them was, of course, if you are selling edited releases, the packaging should clearly reflect this

 A series cannot be advertised as Complete if several minutes of footage are missing from each episode

 I realize that some reviewers are satisfied with the edited versions, however, I am not, and will be selling my copy to the local used book store, and hoping that sometime in the future, the original first-run episodes will be made available for release
 So, for those of you looking for a complete second season, that is unedited, it looks like you might as well hang it up

 Warner Brothers doesn't own the rights, so don't expect to see anything but an edited, syndicated version of the second season, as well...

The actors are good and Emily Blunt is always a good actress and good eye candy. The problem I have is the film is a little over three hours long and the first half deals with Henry's divorce from Catherine and the Anne Bolyn affair. The last half tries to cover Queens Jane,Anne,Catherine and the last queen also a Catherine. It just goes to fast Anne of Cleves gets ONE scene, the last half is WAYYY to rushed. Other than that though, not too bad. If you liked the Elizabeth movies you should like this too.

$REVIEW.: The Conspirator (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)I purchased this DVD of The Conspirator, and have now seen it three or four times. It is a Historic, True account of what was behind the assination of President Lincoln. The fact that Mary Surrett was not proven guilty, in a Prejudice Court and Environment. The Constitution totally ignored by all those of the Prosecution, the fact that she was guilty before even being tried in a Military Court and not one by her Peers. The Secretary of War only interested in seeing someone "pay" for Lincoln's assination, innocent or guilty, man or woman. Others involved in the Conspiracy lied in court, or was not apprehended and got off scott free.  The DVD arrived in very good condition and well packed. Very good job, for the wrapping, sending and condition of items bought, is very important for the consumer. Thank you. I would recommend this movie to anyone who finds interest in our Country's history.Also, the true feelings of the Americans, both North and South towards one another. Much hurt, pain and grief from all. For the North continued for several decades to punish those who were on the Confederate side of the boundries of this country. They were even denied to have equal representation or anyone representing them in our National Government-Congress or House of Representatives, for a long time after the war ended.Abraham Lincoln knew the feelings and pain of the Northern and Southern people towards one another. He "did not" want the South punished for "any reason" after the war ended. He just wanted our country to be reunited, be civil and sypathtic to one another, so as to heal all the wounds from this horrible war. His full intentions was to reunify the United States of America. This is what he was fighting for. To once again see America reunited. But sadly it didn't happen that way, due to his death. This is quite evident and reveals it so much in this movie.A movie that every school child should see, or even adults, for it is a very sad part of our American Heritage and History. But the TRUTH, it reveals.Thank you to Robert Redford for bringing this very factual, moving, emotional and Historical movie for all Americans to see and experience. A great job very well done.I wonder if someday, someone like Mr. Redford, will make a historical movie, based entirely on facts, the truth of the John F. Kennedy Assination? Yes it is out there. For even today they (experts in many different fields) are still researching and revealing what took place. I will never live to see it, but maybe someday the whole truth will come out for Americans to know the Conspiracy that enveloped his murder. LBJ had much to gain by getting rid of the Kennedy Brothers, and he managed it, all within his term as Vice President (to become the new President of the USA) and President then for a second term of office. Also, the murder of Martin Luther King. How many died because of his Greed and Lust for Power and Money.
$review_summary.: Very good, entertaining, historic account and how it changed our Laws in this Country.

$REVIEW.: My biggest beef with this story was that Angelina Jolie got top billing and as far as I'm concerned, she was just a secondary character. I guess her status gets her top billing even if she has a three-second walk-on. She has a substantial part, no doubt, but James McAvoy is the real star here, and he did a pretty decent job.The story was certainly not what I expected! I thought it was going to be a conventional cops-chasing-the-bad guy type of thing, but instead it was about super assassins, with Matrix-like super powers. That being said, the movie was a lot of fun.Though I like Angelina Jolie, I don't like the fact she got top billing while the real star of this movie was tucked in there behind her name. This is the nature of marketing and show business, I guess. Overall, still a good movie and a great vehicle for James McAvoy. Recommended.

Who knew Gene Tierney could be so funny? The scene where she arranges to have him win back his money in the casino is hilarious as he tries to rationalize his winning streak. Many great scenes, interesting villains, funny dialogue and great suspense. Fun.

$review_text.: I remember reading on a home theatre website that LOTR was going to be released in a theatrical version first followed by a director's cut later on.Upon reading that, I was furious
I'm here to say now that if you can serve up my words on a platter, I will eat them.It still kind of bugs me that I almost bought two versions of this film, but the extended version does add so much excellent backstory and detail to the main film that I admit it was well worth the wait.Not one person that I've shown this film to has not liked it


This is truly epic filmmaking and should be (not necessarily budget or special effects wise, but in vision, directing and acting) the baseline of what constitutes a &quot;good film.&quot;I cannot recommend this film any higher.

One Thanksgiving Nina Ostroff (Meester) surprises everyone by showing up unexpectedly


This innocent act changes both families forever

For awhile now I have started watching movies without seeing the trailers for it

That way I go in with no real expectations and no idea about what the movie is about

I did that with this one
I knew the basic plot but that was it


I have to say I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this

The writing is very witty and funny and I laughed out loud most of the way through


The movie deals with a very hard and sensitive subject but has so much heart and laughs that it takes the pain away from the idea and makes it enjoyable to watch


This is a very good indi-comedy that I highly recommend


Overall, very very funny and very much worth watching

I say B+.



$SUMMARY.: A very very funny under the radar comedy that deserves to be seen by a larger audience then it will get. Laugh-out-loud. I say B

$review_text.: Visually, Girl with a Pearl Earring is absolutely stunning. Viewing the film on DVD, one could actually watch the entire piece with the sound turned completely off and enjoy it just as much...as has been said many times before; the film is like viewing a Vermeer painting in motion.Based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier of the same name, the story is a speculative exploration into the identity of the model of the famous Vermeer painting. A young woman from a poor family is forced to seek employment and finds work as a maid in the Vermeer household. A tacit love affair develops between Griet (Scarlett Johansson) and Vermeer (Colin Firth) though in a purely emotional and mental sense, as her appreciation of art, due to Griet's father being a painter, intrigues the master, and he begins to teach her about colour and the delicate skill of mixing paint to achieve just the right shade and depth. I loved the scene where Vermeer asks Griet to tell him the colour of the clouds in the sky. She responds with the answer, "white", to then observe more intently, to answer, "Yellow, blue and grey..." Vermeer is pleased with this answer.It is no wonder that the film won many awards and was Oscar nominated for art direction, set design and costume design because the historical accuracy and beauty in all three categories is simply astounding.In fact, viewing the DVD with a good friend, she would comment after a particular scene that she was sure she had seen "that" painting before. Going back over the film, one can almost detect past master works of that time. It would be interesting to investigate this further and possibly connect certain scenes with actual paintings of the period.The soundtrack composed by Alexandre Desplat, also nominated for many awards including the Oscar for The Queen (2006) and the Golden Globe for The Painted Veil and Girl with a Pearl Earring, is both beautiful and haunting.In itself, Girl with a Pearl Earring is a true work of art. The time spent and attention to detail certainly showed in the final product.Director Peter Webber (Hannibal Rising 2007) managed a very young Scarlett Johansson to perform with mature restraint, concentrating on her expression, particularly those wonderful eyes.An absolute 5 star rating...

Contact seems to be the franchises most action oriented chapter yet. Here there against the borg. The movies action is actualy pretty nice, and the special effects are considerably revamped. But the plot is solid enough but not the most engaging. But if anything though ill give the movie credit for being the most intense of the batch since The Undiscovered country.

$review_text.: The previously read commentaries of the film are all valid, but for those of us that, after viewing the film with all its texural variations, might want to follow some of the obvious visual games implied in the title of this extraordinary work, it's a lot of fun.My friends and I have always enjoyed the game of locating ALL of the "Numbers" implied in the title.  This, of course is dependant on how close to the original theatrical aspect ratio you get.  It doesn't work well at all in a full-screen edition.This game is difficult if you're only paying attention to the cast and the storyline of these splendid characters portrayed on-screen.To properly play the game, I feel that the viewer must be sufficiently acquainted with the story and its twists and turns, to follow the digital progression from start to finish.  To keep this fun element in the film, must have been difficult at best, as it precludes the transposition of scenes for the sake of goosing up the storyline.  The editing had to done progressively or other scenes would have to be reshot, in order to properly continue the numerical progression.This provides a fun diversion in the storyline in what must have been a nerve-wracking way to shoot and assemble a motion picture.

$review_text.: Paul Newman plays a Boston lawyer on the skids with alcohol who takes on a negligence case against two prominent doctors and a hospital run by the Boston Archdiocese

It's a sort of do-or-die case for Newman, and it goes pretty badly against him, until he is able to get the help of one of the nurses who was in the operating room when the negligence took place

It's pretty much a one-man show for Newman, and he does a bang-up job

We can see into his character thoroughly, and it's not all goody-goody idealism: after he's turned down a $210,000 "payoff" (out-of-court settlement) thinking he has a chance to win, and then his chief witness is bought off, we see him try desperately to get the settlement money back


The trial is pure Hollywood, with the judge, too, against him, and Newman winning the jury over with a plea for compassion and doing right

Jack Warden does a good job as Newman's senior partner and mentor, as does James Mason as the suave and wily defense lawyer


But Charlotte Rampling is a total non-entity as the double-dealing woman who falls in the sack with Newman
There's much hokum and predictability here, but Newman is so good he makes the movie hum


Definitely worth a watch.

$review_text.: Before I watched this show with my wife, I thought it might be a satire/comedy, and she was suspecting Joaquin Phoenix would be playing a mentally ill character. Within only minutes, it was unexpectedly clear that this show met neither of those expectations!(Spoiler Alert)The depth of the main character's letter-writing skill, the genuine nature of his relationships with his ex-wife, good friends, and co-workers, as well as many other indicators all showed that this was no mentally-ill person falling in love with a computer.Somehow, Spike Jonze and others who created this masterpiece managed to go where NO movie we've ever seen has gone! Deep into the realistic realms of inquiry into our society's possible uses of technology in the very-near-future. In a way, 'Her' taught us a similar lesson to that offered by &#34;Minority Report.&#34; Just because we may stumble upon the 'technology' to 'create' human beings who foresee murders, enabling us to prevent/stop them before they occur . . . doesn't mean that that technology is ethical or should actually be used. Similarly, just because we may be capable of developing Artificial Intelligence in the form of Operating Systems that so easily and effortlessly organize & improve our lives, yet are actually able to evolve and develop a sense of being/personhood . . . doesn't mean we actually SHOULD do that! How insanely unethical!I LOVE these ideas, like the books &#34;The Giver,&#34; &#34;Tuck Everlasting,&#34; &#34;1984,&#34; &#34;Brave New World,&#34; and &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34; that point out futuristic technologies or really cool 'ideas' that, when looked at on a deeper level, prove to be the creepiest ideas of all.

While not nearly the quality of a Tom Clancy story, it does have an excellent cast which makes it enjoyable to watch. The flight sequences are just too unbelieveable to take seriously. There is a lot of action and an engaging plot which will keep your attention. I enjoyed this film just from the all star cast.While this is a good film, I recommend Tom Clancy's series based on the character of CIA Analyst Jack Ryan.

 The film is a long lost cousin of "Hitch" and is rather contrived
 But romantic comedies are contrived - nothing new here


 I enjoyed watching David Boreanaz smile - his other roles are always so serious - I very rarely seen him smile

 Besides - he is easy on the eyes

 Not all movies are a home run - I realize that

 Anyhow, this film had some redeeming moments
 This film is a very high-end Lifetime movie
 As another reviewer stated - watch this movie only if you are a David B

$REVIEW.: I bought this movie thinking it would be a good slasher. From reading up on it I thought it sounded good. I also bought this because I was a huge Danielle Harris fan and I figured with her in the movie the movie would be at least average. I usually enjoy movies she is in. The main issue with the movie was the writing. The second issue was actors not being used properly. Harris and Shepis didn't get enough screen time. What bothered me is I thought those two should played different parts then they were playing that were bigger roles.The plot is years after a tragic accident leaves a young child scarred for life, the people responsible pay - with their lives. It's a story that had been done before many times. This time due to the writing I had trouble following the movie and guessing who the killer was. The gore was good. There was good action in the story. I thought the acting was very good for a horror movie. I thought Courtney Baxter did a good job as the woman had the scarred face from the accident. I liked her character and felt for her character. Ashley C Williams did good too. The actors all did good but the poorly written script hurt the movie severely. I think had it been better this could have been a really good slasher movie. I think the other as I said before Shepis and Harris having smaller parts was a mistake by the director. It was wasting good talent. If they were in the movie more they may have made it a better movie. They just missed the mark with this one.But in the end I recommend you rent this movie and not buy it unless you get it cheap. I think hardcore horror fans will enjoy it and I think new horror fans might be disappointed. Cheers!

For a movie made in 1991, the transfer is flawless. It looks a lot better than the previous blu ray version.2.) The sound is amazing! (Dolby 6.1) The fact that they included a headphones sound option is fantastic! I watched it once with my Bose Quite Comfort 2 headphones, and it blew me away how awesome it was!!!!3.) They have most of the features (all of the good ones at least) from the last two versions of the movie on DVD.4.)

Although I wasn't as crazy about DeNiro's performance, I must say that the story of their developing friendship was worth the price of the film. There is a second storyline, though, about drug dealers & stolen money, & I feel they could've jettisoned that whole part of the film. If they had just left it as a character study of these two people & their relationship, that would've made a much better film.

$review_text.: Back in the 80s, Butterfly was one of those movies you always heard about, but never actually saw

 Men's magazines at the time talked a lot about it, and then there were all those Razzie awards

 Pia won a Golden Globe, but scandal struck when it was suggested that Butterfly producer and Zadora husband M


Riklis BOUGHT the award for her

(This inuendo is discussed in the commentary and in the 44-minute featurette on this DVD.) Well, what a surprise!  The movie is pretty good, in a scenery chewing, John Waters kind of way
It's short on skin, long on sleaze and NEVER BORING
 Orson Welles hams it up, Stacy Keach tries his level best to rise above the material, even Ed McMahon and June Lockhart (Mom Robinson from Lost in Space) show up

 Besides Keach, the only performance that rises above the material is Kate Nelligan, who seems to be acting in a completely different (high quality) movie
 Director Matt Cimber frequently gets a bad rap for his pictures, mainly because lots of people like to paint him as the bad guy in his marriage to Jayne Mansfield (two sides to every story, you know), but his direction here is very effective


If you like this, you should also check out another Cimber film, The Witch Who Came from the Sea, an interesting movie that does NOT feature a witch

In Butterfly, the cinematography is splendid, the Ennio Morricone soundtrack majestic, the script so-so, the acting very uneven, but if you like good B-pictures, C-pictures and D-pictures, you'll love it


Unlike another commentator, I've never been a big fan of Pia Zadora, but I'll admit: Nobody else could play the part as well

And hats off to Stacy Keach for trying so hard to take the material seriously

 Also a pat on the back to Orson Welles for his willingness to cash the check


 One thing to watch for: When Keach and Zadora go into the silver mine, the scene is shot almost identically to an early shot in Welles' own Mr
Arkadin


 But Welles would never horn in on directorial duties on somebody else's picture, would he?  Anyhow, this movie really is worth seeing.

$REVIEW.: I would rate Wrestlemania XIX as arguably the best Wrestlemania ever.  The WWE Superstars gave everything they had in every match - especially in the triple-threat women's title match - and overall fan enthusiasm at the SAFECO field arena in Seattle, Washington was very high.  Other noteworthy matches were the Hogan-McMahon streetfight, Angle vs. Lesnar, and The Rock vs. Austin (I was glad to see "the People's Champion" - with three devasting Rock Bottom slams - finally score a Wrestlemania pinfall win over "the Rattlesnake").There are two reasons, however, why I'm only giving Wrestlemania XIX a four- as opposed to a five-star rating:  1) the four-woman "catfight" was a little silly (plus, I didn't need to see the Coach in his Fruit-o'-the-Looms), though I'm sure others enjoyed it; and 2) I really felt that Booker T should've won the World Heavyweight Title from Triple H.  "The Game," the great althelete that he is, has held that belt far too long; meanwhile, Booker T has seriously paid his dues since coming to the WWE in 2001 and, in my opinion, REALLY deserved it, as well as a win at "the Granddaddy of 'em all."  I sincerely hope that this isn't a bad omen of things to come as far as Booker T's major title prospects in the WWE are concerned.Overall, Vince McMahon outdid himself this year.

Luckily, I have just seen TTTSANTB, and well, we can all have pleasant memories of what Erasure used to be can't we? Becaause this DVD is OUTSTANDING.This looks to have been recorded during their Chorus years (I attended  one of their 'Wild' concerts) and Andy looks amazing in this


totally fit, voice in perfect shape, and just boogying all over the place (as opposed to the other DVD)

I havent the foggiest why they splurged so much on this show, because it's spectacular
Dancers, costumes, props, everything


The catalog they use is equally fun too, with new stuff (eg everything from the Chorus album) mixed in with the old (Sometimes, Oh Lamour etc)
I really also how they plucked the obscure songs out of the catalog as well, for example, "Love Is A Loser" and especially that extremely old B side, "Soldier's Return".This is just dynamite


Crisply edited and sounds great, this is a must for any Erasure fan.

$REVIEW.: Although this is the third film in the Jurassic Park series, it is still quite entertaining. I believe this movie stands on it's own, as a good action film. Yes, the awe and wonder of seeing the dinosaurs on film for the first time is gone, but JP3 has some good things going for it. First of all, this movie's running length is not overly-long (it's only 90 minutes). Second, although it is an action film, it manages not to take itself too seriously (and even has refreshingly humorous moments throughout the movie). And finally, the filmakers have added some new dinosaurs to the mix, in this film, in addition to making them look even more realistic (technology has greatly improved since the first flick 12 years ago, and it shows). The actual plot is not bad either, but people are ultimately more interested in the quality of the dinosaur action sequences, and they deliver quite a bite (no pun intended).

$review_text.: It's not uncommon for a film to start at the end of the story, then explain through flashback what led up to that moment.  MEMENTO starts at the end, but is anything but common, because it then progresses backward in time.  Each 5 to 10 min. segment (shot in color) occurs at a point in time just prior to the one before.  Interspersed within this reverse narrative are B&amp;W scenes in chronological order which, if all put together, lead up to the final segment, which is the beginning of the story.  How could something that sounds so confusing make a watchable film, you might ask?  It's a tribute to screenwriter/director Nolan that he created such a compelling and thought-provoking mystery/thriller from such a framework.  It's rare to find an unconventional approach to film making that really works..and this does.Guy Pierce is excellent in the role of Lenny, a man who has suffered a severe head injury while trying to defend his wife against an attack by burglars.  This injury has left him incapable of making new memories; he retains nothing for more than 5 or 10 mins.  He can't watch a half hour TV show because by the end, he's forgotten how it started.  His condition is not amnesia; he knows who he is and recalls everything about his life before the injury.  His brain simply won't retain any new experiences.Lenny's wife was raped and murdered by her attackers, leaving him devastated and filled with rage.  A police investigation turned up a suspect known only as &quot;John G.&quot;  Of course, Lenny's injury would quickly cause him to forget all of this, so he has his chest tattooed with &quot;John G. raped and murdered my wife&quot;.  His quest to find and kill  the man who ruined his life is what gives him purpose.  In order to function, he is constantly taking Polaroids and making notes to refer back to after he's forgotten.  The most important clues that he uncovers he has tattooed all over his body.  Lenny's mission is complicated by two people with ulterior motives who take advantage of his dysfunction.  One is Teddy (Pantoliano), a cop helping him find the killer; the other is Natalie (Moss), a woman he meets along the way who he thinks may be able to help him.Christopher Nolan adapted the screenplay (which was nominated for an Oscar) from a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan.  The genius of the script is that it mimics Lenny's handicap in that the viewer doesn't know what preceded the current scene, just as Lenny doesn't know because he's forgotten!  It raises intriguing questions about the role of memory in our perception of reality.  At one point, Lenny is thinking out loud about his predicament.  He wonders how many times he's been reminded and forgotten that his wife is gone.  Imagine learning that a loved one has died, over and over, each time as if it were the first.  &quot;How can I heal if I can't feel time?&quot;  How can he trust others that he only knows through scribbled notes on photographs?  In a surprise revelation near the end of the film, we find that Lenny can't really &quot;know&quot; anything because he can't even trust himself.  Because this film is so unconventional and tough to fully absorb in one viewing, some impatient folks will consider it a waste of time.  But MEMENTO is extremely well made (Oscar nominated for Best Film Editing) and well worth the effort for anyone who appreciates film as art and is not intimidated by complexity.

$REVIEW.: This dourly amusing political comedy from Romania is a throwback to Soviet bloc films of the 1960s (e.g. "Closely Watched Trains"), and its message is that not much has changed since then. People still make fools of themselves while clinging desperately to shreds of dignity, and life is elsewhere. Set in a town somewhere "east of Bucharest," the story follows the events of a day in late December as a few characters make an effort to remember (and remember correctly) what they did when Nicolae Ceausescu's communist government fell - his departure from the capital at 12:08 p.m. Did anyone rush to the town square to celebrate before then, or did they wait until after?For the moderator of a TV call-in show, the question seems to matter a lot. Meanwhile, the young boys of the next generation are setting off firecrackers to startle the grownups, money is short and the only pastime seems to be getting drunk in the local bar, a lone Chinese businessman in town gets his fair share of ethnic abuse, and there's an effort to somehow observe Christmas with a tree and a proper Santa suit. The DVD has a commentary by the director, who reveals that the film was inspired by an actual TV show in his hometown marking the 16th anniversary of the "revolution." Funny and sad.

$review_text.: Here is Olivier at his rollicking best.  This movie must be seen to be believed, and once seen will likely be regularly revisited throughout your life.  It is beyond superlatives.The reviews on this site amply speak of this great film's riches.  While not one of the so-called "major tragedies" of Shakespeare, Olivier uses the play to to hammer home the most essential 101 level lessons about Shakespearean drama and performance -- its broad and physical appeal, its bald directness and outrageous humor, plain human pathos.  If your kids need to start somewhere with the Stratford Bard, this is the place.  It is highly likely that this single film will make a lifetime believer out of them -- and you too.Olivier uses the adaptation of the play by the great British actor David Garrick from a couple centuries back, using the last part of Shakespeare's Henry VI, part 3, for necessary background, and then going off full-tilt into the best melodrama in the English speaking world.  There is no reason to set forth the plot -- Richard himself delivers it to you inch by inch as he schemes his awful trail to power.  Yet too, you laugh with him -- evil is not a black and white, Sunday school, cardboard cut-out proposition.  The drama faces you with its terrifying seductiveness.  This is a lesson once thought vital for developing adults in the English-speaking world, before the current monkey see/monkey do miasma of political correctness -- saying "good things" just to get ahead.  Indeed, Richard is nothing if not the epitome of political correctness.Of course, the story of Richard's character, as Shakespeare presented it, is Tudor era propaganda writ large -- still subject to reasoned debate.  The drama, however, rightly retains its place  as absolutely central to the ethos of the English speaking world, and its cultural claims.  And Olivier nails it at all corners.  Simply, this movie is as essential as a good dictionary, a properly translated bible, and a fundamental background in literature and the language.

$review_text.: This is a beautiful and moving story about love and nostalgia


 In the beginning, Salvatore, a middle-aged filmmaker of some renown, is informed of the passing of Alberto, the old projectionist who had befriended him and had first awakened his love of cinema


As he travel back to his hometown for the funeral, memories of his childhood and youth come tumbling out of him: the boy Salvatore's fascination with the workings of the projector, his growing friendship with Alberto, the raucous, communal warmth of the theater and the ectascy and heartbreak of his first love
These memories have a purity and richness sharpened by the passing time


We the viewers can't help but to be swept up in these vivid scenes and perhaps marvel, along with the older Salvatore at the end of the movie, how movies are akin to our memories and dreams, where colors are forever vibrant, beauty never fades, and love always just a heartbeat away.

$review_text.: This 1931 pre-code depicts how "The Gazette" a sordid "yellow press" muckraking newspaper destroys one family's lives in the quest to raise their weekly circulation numbers. The newspaper owner {Mr. Hinchecliffe }intends to retry "re-fry it  hot" a 20 year old shooting incident of a women's lover by running a serial series {The Love Mad Stenographer} that will dredge  back up the whole affair. The women {Nancy Voorhees} had been acquitted, subsequently married, had a daughter and is living a quiet and respectable life. The newspaper owner hypocritically rationalizes that this series will be a moralistic and cautionary human interest tale for shop girls and secretaries "not to fall in love with their boss".Edward G. Robinson portrays the newspaper's editor - Mr. Randall who has tried to eschew this kind of sensationalized  journalism but goes along with the owner {his nickname for him is the "Sultan of Slop"} to make this the  newspapers major news story to be played up. Randall  immediately warms up to the task and has a new female reporter  Miss Carmody {Ona Munson} tramping the streets to get anything she can and playing it up as a filthy mess by putting Voorhees on trial again { via the Gazette} as a murderess for a crime  for which she  had been acquitted .  And play it up they will for as Randall's secretary Miss Taylor {a wry, cynical excellent performance by Aline  MacMahon} comments - "I think you can always get people interested in the crucifixion of a women".The newspaper will use and does anything necessary to  get into the women's/families past and present - even to the point of planting a newspaper reporter as a phony minster to gain the families confidence and get "dirt" on them. This reporter {Mr.Isobod} is well played with a slimy, hypocritical relish by a "pre-Frankenstein" Boris Karloff. Voorhees has a 20 year old daughter that is about to be married, She is terrified that her past {which her daughter knows nothing about {which includes that her daughter is illegitimate from the man that she shot will be discovered. The newspaper gets going full blast and in a week the family is under the microscope and under siege. The daughter, Jenny Townsend {a surprisingly effective performance by Marian Marsh} learns everything and fears that she will lose her parents and her fianc&eacute;' because of the scandal.Isabod, posing as a kindly, concerned minister gains access to the family and gets the lowdown on the forthcoming marriage and much else. The despair of the parents as the pressure mounts is too much {sympathetically played by H.B Warner and Frances Starr}so when the mother is found dead from committing suicide, the father in his despair also takes his own life. That is just more grist for the mill when Miss Carmody and a photographer break into the parents apartment, find them dead, phone in the story and it is a page one blowout story complete with pictures of the corpses. When Randall hears about the suicide he knows that the paper is directly responsible for the deaths by digging up the old story.This leads to the astonishingly tense, scathing and shattering climax of the film when Jenny Townsend faces down Randall, Hinchecliffe and Isobode with the question "why did you kill my mother" and demands that the omnipotent publisher raise her parents from the dead since the newspaper can solve any problem. Marian Marsh is an unknown actress today but in her agonized, semi- controlled,  hysterical  denunciation  -  in  this scene she  really lets herself  go and  her performance here  is  worthy of Betty Davis -  marvelous.  She is just stopped in shooting them by her fianc&eacute; { a stiff Anthony Bushnell}  who tells them that they have gorged on misery and blood and that no one has had  the courage to "crush them  back into the earth". After they leave,  E.G. Robinson then goes it one better with one of the greatest  short performances of his career - a  controlled, agonized , white hot angry tirade to Hinchecliffe in condemning  himself and Hinchecliffe as "degenerate assassins, diseased hypocrites and berates himself for his 10 years of blood soaked  service to the newspaper and quits  right on the spot. Miss Taylor  who has quietly loved  him also quits just as another sensational story comes to Randall's desk  - a double  homicide  with the murderer committing suicide.This is an excellent and still  relevant  film that highlights that even 80 years ago {before the internet ,Google and 24 hour news channels} that's sensationalized, scandalized news that celebrates misery and caters to mindless readers was alive, well and just like today SELLS BIG TIME !!!. Edward G. Robinson is {as usual} outstanding as the driven, hard  drinking, tormented editor with a "Pontus Pilate" complex - washing  his  hands  20 times a day as  if to  clean the  muck of the job off them. There is the usual sharp dialogue, face pace and tight editing that is typical of 1930s Warner Brothers movies. I give this movie an enthusiastic 5 star and highly recommend it - This film is truley excellent.

$review_text.: This DVD comes with both the 1935 version and the 1952 version.These are both based on French author Victor Hugo's book.I have never read the book so am not sure which version more closely follows the author's concept. I did notice most of the script was the same. But I also noticed some of the context and scenes themselves were different. Not sure if that was due to time and/or censuring.The 1935 version is considered one of the best with four Oscar nominations including Best Picture. It was produced by Darryl Zanuck and starred Fredric March and Charles Laughton.  It is black and white and the runtime is 108 minutes.The 1952 version was directed by Lewis Milestone. Only actor I readily recognized was Elsa Lanchester who happens to have been married to Charles Laughton.  This version is also black and white and 105 minutes.The special featurette was The Fugitive and the Pursuer: Vidocq.  The connection to this movie is that Hugo's "reformed criminal Jean Valjean and his pursuer, police inspector Javert, were modelled after Vidocq." His legacy is being considered the father of modern criminology and the French Police. After leaving the police he started the first private detective agency.  While very interesting I would have prefered a featurette on the author Victor Hugo.We picked up this Studio Classic as part of a 4 disc set celebrating the 75th anniversary of 20th Century Fox.

$REVIEW.: This rating would be a 4.5 if it was available.  Everything about this film was fantastic, except that it could have been about half an hour shorter and been even more stellar.  Aside from pacing issues, every aspect of this film was spot-on:  direction, acting, writing...  It was interesting to see San Francisco presented in a light progressed beyond the idealistic haze of the 60s, yet not having quite reached its hippie goals.  The cultural transition presented in the wider picture of this film is as extraordinary as the depiction of Milk's life.  While Penn is a great actor, I did find that some of the mannerisms he fused into Milk were ones I've seen him do with other characters.  This distracted my spell several times, but his ability to express the gentle kindness of Milk at any given point made up for the unoriginality of physicality.  The film is, of course, terribly sad, for far more reasons than the obvious untimely demise of Milk.  The personal drama that he gave himself over to in creating this revolution is well documented.  A stern reminder that this was not so long ago, it is a must-see film.

$REVIEW.: I had high expectations for the movie given there were some great names in horror like Danielle Harris and Lacey. Billy Zane is pretty good actor adding him into the fray helped. I thought the acting was good. The story was good. It's not going to rank on a list of greatest horror movies ever but I rate this above average. The last one third of the movie was awesome. This is one of Harris's better horror movies in recent memory as she has been picking poor movies and getting too small parts. Her talents aren't wasted here. Some parts were scary and other parts were funny. I liked the combo of horror and comedy.It wasn't hard for Billy Zane to pull off playing a jerk but his character at times was funny and entertaining. Lacey was kind of understated and gave a good performances. I thought all the other actors did their parts well. The movie was a little slow in the beginning but the actors keep it going. I think I would recommend this for rental first. I think it's an underrated film. Harris fans should check it out. Fans of ghost stories will enjoy this. Give this one a shot! Cheers and Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: When I was a soldier stationed in Germany in the 1970s there was a raid on a Turkish-owned bar on the outskirts of Frankfurt A/M. German Polizei and US CID (US Army Criminal Investigation Division) broke up a white slavery ring that had been operating out of the bar for some time. The bar was a way-point in the transportation route of young European girls (preferably blonde) who had been kidnapped throughout Europe and were being smuggled to be sold in the harems and brothels of the Middle and Far East. The police found some twenty girls in the basement of the bar, some from as far away as Denmark and the Netherlands, waiting to be shipped further down the pipeline.The German police and Interpol had been watching the bar for some time and were hoping to trace the route farther down the track to take down the ringleaders. The white slavers made the mistake of kidnapping the daughter of a US Army colonel whom they thought was a German national. The Colonel learned about the investigation and refused to allow his daughter to be held by the white slavers and victimized so the police could gather intelligence. As it turned out, I learned later, the raid eventually did lead to the disruption of this particular ring because the guys busted talked.So, when I learned what this film was about I went in with a certain amount of understanding of the subject matter. Let me say here that this film hits the nail on the head in presenting its subject matter and the way young women are victimized by ruthless animals only out to make a buck. (SPOILER) The scenes where they show the young women being made into drug addicts to control them are particularly disturbing to me as I've seen the impact drugs had on young girls working as unlicensed street walkers in Germany (a nation that legalized prostitution to make it "safe").  As disturbing as the film was I am glad I watched it and if I had a daughter (I had all sons) I would make her watch this film when she reached an appropriate age in hopes it would make her more careful in how she behaved when I wasn't around to protect her. This is a film every parent should watch - it is a film every teenaged girl and boy should watch. It's sad, but things like what happens to the girls in this movie go on every day.Having said that, the next question is, is the movie good?Well, I've never seen Liam Neeson deliver a bad performance. Even if I didn't like the movie (and he's done a couple turkeys) he has always been superb. No exception here. Sadly, most of the negative comments about this film seem to be from people who don't like action movies. But Neeson elevates this even above the typical action movie. This is a story of family. When I watched Neeson's reaction to what happens to his daughter and his response I imagine it is what Natalie Holloway's daddy wishes he could have done, what every father of a child who has been abducted and brutalized wish they could do.As a professional soldier and former martial arts instructor I find Neeson's action scenes are superbly executed and realistic. Don't look for a superhero leaping tall buildings with a single bound, but watch an expert, who may not be as young as he once was, doing what he knows best for a good cause. The fights are brutal, ruthless, and efficient, pros doing what they do. Even the violence is understated, brutal, but avoids the spectacular many audience have come to expect. What Neeson does is violent but considering the circumstances and motivation, necessary to save his girl. Great stuff.The alleged coincidences do not strain or insult the intelligence overmuch, this is an action movie for folks who think.  Of course, if you thought "The English Patient" deserved the Best Picture Oscar you'll probably hate this film. Otherwise, it is a don't miss. Neeson brings to the revenge flick empathy and gravitas lacking in other such films.As I watched the film I thought of that Army colonel fighting Interpol and the German police to save his daughter. I hope he was able to see this film, I think he'd approve.

$review_text.: I knew Seth was twisted, but I never knew just how much. The only reason I give this DVD two stars is that I did find some of the clips very funny. However, if you like lots of homosexuals and gay jokes, bestiality, toilet humor, and too much sex with robots, household objects, celebrities, etc. then, this is for you. Otherwise, you can catch a lot of the tamer stuff on YouTube. Also, way too much use of the F word. Seth MacFarlane loves to swear. A LOT. And although that's not uncommon these days, for me, it takes away from the humor if it's done too much. This DVD really got me thinking about Seth's sick and twisted sense of humor. It's really bad if left unchecked by the networks. In the future, I think I'll just stick with Family Guy. I know at times that can be over the top, too, but not this bad!! As Peter Griffin would say, Ah, crap!!

 My wife and I watched Volumes 1 and 2 and, despite the ethereal beauty, were really considering shelving the whole thing because  of the pacing

 Then Volume 3 came and -- *click* -- parts started falling  into place; we couldn't wait to get Volume 4 into the VCR


 Yes, the story  slowly unfolds, but you don't just watch Lain, you immerse yourself in it
 By the end, the journey you thought you had started out on leads you to a  completely unexpected destination

It is difficult to film a remarkable book such as Atlas Shrugged, but the scenes were more than adequate and the despicable manner in which the government of that era (the same mentality exists today) was adequately depicted. However, the sound quality of the Atlas shrugged  DVDs is poor.  Actors who cannot project their voice should not be allowed on stage, on film or on DVDs.

$review_text.: A quote from Huppert's character may lead some insight as to what dangerous emotions are brewing inside the minds of two eccentric women, who become the deadliest of friends

 It's like two ticking time bombs not going off on their own, until they are brought together


 What happens when these two become acquainted, does not bode well for the upper class French family who took Bonnaire's character in as a maid.I say ticking time bombs, as there was certainly something in each of these women's past


 Something evil fell upon both of them alone, and the question is, which one of them were responsible for deaths occuring in their past, and which one was accident, or were they both no accident?A lot of these questions do not get answered in this tension building shocker

 The entire film is a set-up for the last few minutes, where Jacqueline Bisset and family are subject to first hand violence that can occur when these two ladies get together.Although Chabrol had another film called The Color of Lies, the hidden secrets in this film seem to outnumber the ones in that one


 It's a slow building but entertaining film, full of mystery, great performances, and a shocking ending


 If you enjoy this, I would also view Nightcap (Merci Pour Le Chocolat) which I found it to be an even better film, with Huppert bringing tension to the lives of another upper class French family, this time, from the inside!

$review_text.: Overall, I really enjoyed what seemed to me to be the authentically artistic (but not historical) character of the movie. Mostly that meant not including standard movie cliches, and having an inspiring story, a complicated plot with no true good guys or bad guys, and good action. By cliches, I mean specifically that I really appreciated the lack of a gratuitous sex scene, and the lack of a scene where the good guy is almost beaten, kneels on the ground, the bad guy swings, and at the last second the good guy jerks up and kills the bad guy. The fighting in this movie is actually good.But I deducted two stars because of the historical problems. While there is an ancient Roman Republican tradition of Roman fighting prowess, and this movie suggests a great conflict between that republican martial tradition and the developing bureaucratic and soft elites under the empire, this movie doesn't do anything to portray the natives of the Island of Britain in an historically accurate way. The setting of the movie is in the 2nd century AD, but Gaelic-speaking Scots-Irish didn't arrive in Scotland from Ireland to establish the Dal Riata until the 5th century. In the 2nd century here were no Gaelic-speakers in what is now Scotland, and there never have been any in central Britain where supposedly "Gaelic" speaking Esca came from. His tribe, the Brigantes, spoke an ancient ancestor of the Welsh/Cornish/Breton languages, a completely different branch of the Celtic language family from Gaelic. The people north of Hadrian's Wall were the Picts, and we have no idea what type of language they spoke - The strongest hypothesis is that it wasn't Indo-European at all, just like Basque & Etruscan are/were not Indo-European. It's extremely unlikely that Esca could have spoken with the people north of Hadrian's Wall, and there's a 0% chance that either he or they were speaking Gaelic.Come on. Can script-writers and movie producers check Wikipedia? Could they at least hire a linguist and an historian to both do some fact checking if the movie people didn't want to take a couple hours to read up online about the actual cultural and linguistic landscape of the time period and area that is the movie's setting?

$REVIEW.: This is a movie that needed to be made. It was just the right vehicle with which to go mainstream with a gay love story.It starts in 1963, when Ennis and Jack spend the summer as sheepherders (not cowboys, although Jack also does rodeos) on Brokeback Mountain. In a scene that seemed completely authentic to someone with no personal experience of homosexuality but plenty experience in sexuality, they end up making love one night in their tent. And we have to say making love, not having sex. There is real feeling here along with the masculine horseplay. Thus begins a loving friendship that lasts over 20 years, mostly on "fishing trips" and other camping adventures away from wives and prying eyes.Remember this starts in 1963, long before the word "gay" had been developed as a healthy way to describe male homosexuality. They had a lot nastier terms in those days. And Ennis remembers when he was a child, his Daddy took him and his brother to view the remains of a man who had been mutilated and killed for being one of a couple of men who lived together. Understand this: he did NOT happen upon the corpse accidentally; his daddy took him to see it. As Ennis said, he probably was one of the people that did it.So naturally they want no one to know about their relationship. Thus the movie explores some of the hazards of closets.OK, no spoilers here. But you definitely do not have to be gay, or even bi, to appreciate this movie. That is exactly what's so valuable about it. Even straights can have real sympathy for the two close friends, likable guys, who look the part, but just don't quite fit the stereotype of the he-man of the western mountains, the rodeo and the ranch.

$REVIEW.: I went into this with high hopes, as the Criterion Collection usually does more than justice to restorations of great older films.But I was terribly shocked by (1) the abbreviated version of the G & S score, cutting some of the best songs; and (2) the terrible miscasting of Kenny Baker as Nanki-Poo, who appears to have wandered in from another planet as an avatar of Perry Como.  His voice is cloying, to the say least, and is a "pop crooner" voice totally unsuited to The Mikado.  Compare, for isntance, Bonaventura Bottome in the English National Opera version (with Eric Idle).  The fact that he speaks with an American accent and has a very American "gee whiz" manner throw off-key the whole movie.The main merits of the blu-ray are the beautiful high definition restoration of the original pastel costumes and sets, as well as the fine comic supporting turns by members of the D'Oyly Carte Company.

$review_text.: When I say good, I mean way better than the Friday the 13th movies anyway lol. What I love about the movies is that they mix fantasy with horror. So it's not just gory and disgusting, it's imaginative and inventive as well.Nightmare on Elm Street: Nancy's friends start getting killed off in their dreams by disfigured man with claws and it's up to her to stop him. His name is Freddie Krueger and he was burnt to death by angry parents of children that he murdered. So now he's back for revenge in the town that he died killing teenagers in their sleep. The result is a scary and often goofy "what Freddy movie isn't a little goofy ?" film. *** out of ****Nightmare on Elmstreet 2: This is probably the worse one. I mean a new kid moves in to Nancy's house and Freddy takes over his body. He doesn't just take over his body though, he rips through his body to get into the real world and kill people. Plus get this...the guy is still alive after he rips through his body and climbs out into the real world. He's not just still alive though...he doesn't have a mark on him. So yeah this is the worse even if Freddy is probably his scariest here and is no nonsense. **Nightmare on Elmstreet 3: Part 3 brings Nancy back and she wants to help kids in a Psychward that Freddie is after. This is probably the most imaginative one. While it has good effects and is really gory gross on top of it. I mean there's a kid that makes puppets so in his sleep Freddie walks him with his veins like he's a puppet. Which is pretty hard for even me to watch lol. It gets a little corny when Nancy shows  the kids that they can fight back and do whatever they want in there dreams but still it's one of the better sequels.*** out of ****Nightmare on Elmstreet 4: This is also one of the better sequels. Freddie comes back and kills all the survivors from part 3. Their friends soon realize that Freddy is after them as well and that they need to fight back. This film is imaginative but hard to watch for me. Mean is one gross part with meatballs with faces on them and Freddie eats them of course. Then there's one part where he turns a punk girl into a bug and crushes her. The film is still well made and entertaining though.***Nightmare on Elmstreet 5: The girl from part 4 that killed Freddie is back and pregnant and Freddie is back too of course. He wants her...baby for his own ? It's not as bad as part 2 but it's not very good anyway. ** 1/2 out of ****Freddie's Dead: Not scary but pure whacky imaginative fun and yes sadly it's one of my favorites. I mean you have Freddie controlling a kid like he's playing a video game, him killing a kid with a hearing aid by making a lot of noise until...his head explodes. Plus yes it even has a smart unpredictable script. I wanna say ***1/2 but I may get too many unhelpful reviews if I say that lol. So I'll just say ***.Wes Craven's New Nightmare: This is also one of the best. It has the actress that plays Nancy finding that Freddie is fighting his way into the real world. He plans on using her son to get into the real world. Plus he is killing people in their sleep as well and kills her husband. It's up to Nancy..I mean Heather to stop Freddie and save her son. The movie is mindbending and actually scary at times. With Robert Englund being more scary than goofy. ***1/2 out of ****

$review_text.: I do have to agree with the other reviewers that have mentioned an obvious amount of overzealous editing! IMO it's the biggest flaw in the film! To those who haven't read the book, the editing will probably leave you confused at times! I do however, much prefer where they ended the movie as compared to the book. And I also appreciate how they removed a lot of the vampire themes! I feel doing these things really gave the flick some true blue originality! I personally believe that the reviewer who said the special effects are laughable is being way too critical on a movie that is around two decades old. This movie is no Matrix granted, but even today I find the ambience of the movie to be quite gothic and darkly moody. I too would love to see this movie done over to DVD in an uncut version... I'd bet my bottom dollar such a version would redeem most of the bad rap it tends to get! If your a horror buff, and like a little originality... This movie is definitely worth giving a chance!

$REVIEW.: Claude Rains stars as the father of four pretty, musically talented daughters who learn all about the complications of love.  The Lane Sisters - Lola, Priscilla, and Rosemary, along with Gale Page, play the loving sisters.  Of these, the non-Lane, Page, gives the best performance as the down-to-earth oldest sister, pursued by one man, but in love with another.  It's a quiet, touching performance.  The men in their lives are Jeffrey Lynn, Frank McHugh, Dick Foran, and John Garfield.  Garfield is easily the standout among the boyfriends, his hardened-by-life musician a precursor to the Method actors of the Fifties.  In a way, he clashes with the idealized family presentation and sweet goodness of this unbelievable family, yet it also helps to ground the film in reality.  It is sentimental, but everyone performs earnestly and the music adds to the atmosphere. It's a very easy way to spend ninety minutes.

$review_text.: Bigger isn't always better.  That's the lesson inventor Flint  Lockwood and the rest of the town learn the hard way.  For years, Flint's inventions  had  been total disasters, but one day,  Flint finally invents a  real  winner  --  a device that turns rain from  the  clouds into food.  Since  the townspeople are stuck eating only sardines,  they're thrilled  by the sudden  variety of food to choose from.  However,  growing demands for more food start overloading the system  and so,  what started  out  as a great  invention  quickly turns to  disaster, too.There's an environmental message in here about our  out-of-sight-out-of-mind  mentality about disposing waste, but it's not  played as  heavy-handedly  as Wall-E.There are 3 other messages here as well, which are:1 -- it's unfulfilling when you try to meet your needs through shallow substitutes2 -- it's important to be your authentic self (this lesson isn't just for Flint, but also for the newscaster who pretends to be dumb when she's not)3 -- you shouldn't get addicted to fame because fame is fickle (and again, this lesson isn't just for Flint, who's just now experiencing fame for the first time, but also for an aging child star who's just now having it taken away)Kids will surely delight  seeing how food is transformed in this movie... from  rooftops made out of ice cream scoops  to  a tornado made out of spaghetti and meatballs.  The movie has it's funny moments,  too, like Flint's  ice cream snowball fight with unsuspecting victims and the lame chant kids came up with to taunt the newscaster.The acting can be a little over dramatic at times, but perhaps little kids will like that.  There's also gross out humor like the dad kissing the son who just vomited and the monkey pulling out the heart of a gummi bear.  Depending on a child's humor, they'll either laugh at this or be grossed out.Towards the end, we get a kind of Indiana Jones sequence  that, on one hand, is clever in it's use of food, but on the  other  hand,  drags  a bit too long.Overall, I thought this movie was funny and clever  with a great ending showing how appearances can sometimes be deceiving.

$review_text.: "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" is smarter than your average epic.  And longer.  And more exciting.  And more moving.  In other words, it's just better overall.  Like the first two LOTR movies, "Return of the King" flies along at a note-perfect pace, ensuring that viewers won't be looking at their watches even as the film moves past the three-hour mark.  Perhaps the most notable aspect of this trilogy is the way it manages to expertly balance grandiosity and intimacy, and the finale is no exception.  It's truly amazing that Peter Jackson And co. manage to tie up the loose ends from "Fellowship" and "The Two Towers," introduce a few new characters and themes, and still find time for some more of the trilogy's own unique brand of action-packed set pieces.Since "Return of the King" is the conclusion of a trilogy it only makes sense for it to up the ante from its predecessors, and it does so in a manner that makes "Return of the Jedi" and "Terminator 3" look like an episode of "Barney."  The stakes here are higher, the battles bigger, the monsters scarier, and the Orcs even uglier.  However, despite the film's huge budget and epic scope Peter Jackson's direction always finds time to zoom in so we can see how the events are wearing on the characters, reminding us that Hollywood epics can still be full of emotional depth.  This one runs the gamut, with plenty of heroism and a bit of comic relief tempered by an abundance of fear, conflict, and death.Right from the beginning, it's obvious what kind of movie we're in for.  The movie's opening plunges you right into the abyss, opening with a young Smeagol's murder of his friend for the ring and then the harrowing depiction of his descent into madness and deformity.  Things don't get much better from there, either.  Despite the fact that "The Two Towers" ended with the defeat of Sauron's and Saruman's army at Helm's Deep, "Return of the King" still opens on a pretty big down note.  Mankind is teetering ever closer to the brink of extinction, and more than either of the first two installments this one has a palpable sense of dread hanging over it.  This is never more apparent than when Faramir leads his soldiers in a doomed charge against an impregnable Orc position in an effort to regain his father's good graces.  At the same time his father is piggishly stuffing his face while Pippin serenades him in a scene eerily reminiscent of Nero playing his fiddle while Rome burned.  Moving stuff, to be sure.Even though it doesn't even constitute the climax of the movie, "Return of the King" is highlighted by a sustained action sequence the likes of which you can scarcely conceive.  I don't think it would be much of a stretch to say the battle at Minas Tirith is quite probably the greatest ever filmed, taking up about a half-hour of screen time and probably costing enough to end world hunger for good.  Here's a quick laundry list of a few key elements: flaming catapulted rocks; elephants ridden by crews of archers; flying, shrieking Nazguls; the return of the malevolent Witch King; an awe-inspiring cavalry charge; and a tide-turning army of ghosts.  Not to mention, the cinematography involved is nothing short of staggering.  My brief rundown hardly suffices, though; this is truly a scene that must be seen to be believed.Of course, even if they don't register quite as much as previously, the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Smeagol still remains the central point of the action.  Their trip to Mount Doom becomes progressively more difficult and hellish, moving through ever harsher terrain, with Smeagol's treachery only serving to undermine the mission even further.  The bond of friendship between Frodo and Sam, which held them together through so much difficulty in the first two movies, becomes strained as they come closer to Mordor and Smeagol gets more devious.  As before, there's a sense of impending disaster lurking just around the corner, but it becomes more pronounced at every turn.In the end, "Return of the King" is not only the last LOTR movie; it may well be the best.  I could even go so far as to say that LOTR has assumed a lofty position as THE movie Trilogy, since it manages perhaps more than any other to match its huge budgets with a huge heart.  I guess only time will tell.  Now to read the books!

The Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal was solid and good by battle royal standards with a awesome finish to boot. The John Cena-Bray Wyatt match was not great but had pretty good storytelling even with the sloppy finish. The Undertaker-Brock Lesnar match was also not great but pretty good. The Vickie Guerrero Divas Invitational title match was solid for that type of match. The Randy Orton-Batista-Daniel Bryan-3 way-WWE title match was a heart-pounding,smash-mouth,hardcore brawl. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.

$review_text.: I came very close to not buying this DVD, based on the bad reviews, but I am SO glad I did!  The negative comments from others led me to expect a horrible abomination from the theatrical cut, but it actually wasn't as bad as I feared.  Different, yes, but not bad.  Yes, the sound effects are different (for a reason), yes the song tracks are different (for a reason), yes, some of the visual effects are different (for a reason).  (The reasons are all fully explained in the commentary of this edition.)  What you have to understand is that the director, Richard Kelly, considers this a "remix" version of the film, not a "replacement" version.  He's not pulling a George Lucas and trying to usurp previous versions with this one instead; he was given the chance to make an additional version, so he did.What is awesome about this edition, however, is not the changes from the theatrical version, but Kelly's commentary track with Kevin Smith, because it finally makes everything so perfectly clear!  When I first saw the original film on the theatrical DVD release, I kind of understood it, but not completely.  Then I watched the deleted scenes and the extras (the Philosophy of Time Travel excerpts) on the original DVD and I got a much better understanding of the film.With the director's cut, the deleted scenes and the POTT excerpts have now been added into the film, so if you've never seen the theatrical release you might find this one easier to understand.  Completists should be aware that some of the deleted scenes that have been restored to this version are NOT available in the deleted scenes on the theatrical release DVD - they are making their first appearance here.But it's when you listen to the director's cut commentary that we finally get the full explanation of what Kelly meant to convey.  I won't spoil anything here, but even if you think you sort-of understand what the "manipulated living" and the "manipulated dead" and the "receiver," etc all mean (from the POTT excerpts), it's never really made completely clear until this commentary with Kevin Smith -- even Kevin Smith admits there are things he didn't understand until this meeting with Kelly, like what the other characters were (subconsciously) doing throughout the story to influence Donnie.  And there is one relationship between two characters that I don't think anyone but Kelly got until now.Now, this might mean that Kelly is just really bad at getting his point across on a dramatic, script level - otherwise why would it have taken this many tries to get the true plot structure clear to the audience?  Unless he meant this film to be the "2001: A Space Odyssey" for its generation: deliberate vagueness to leave it open for individual interpretation.And for those wanting to know why Kevin Smith was chosen to assist in the commentary, it's because Kelly was attempting to make the movie more like a comic-book film (despite his own admission of not being knowledgeable about comic books) and asked Kevin Smith along to talk about whether or not he succeeded.Bottom line, which version do I prefer?  Well, the theatrical version, but mostly because I prefer its song selections to the director's cut song selections (song choices and song placements, which both changed).  But to truly understand this film, you need to be familiar with the deleted scenes, the extras, AND the director's cut commentary - all of which are in this edition.
$SUMMARY.: Buy This for the Director's Commentary!

$review_text.: "The Brain That Wouldn't Die" is definitely a large step up from "The Beast of Yucca Flats", but how much of a compliment is that?NOT IN THE RUNNING FOR WORST B FILM EVER:This film is watchable even though it runs for 80 minutes and has quite a bit of dialogue in it. Let's say it promises more than it delivers, but the possibility of the delivery looms until the very end when indeed something of a horrific event does finally take place.WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?:Joesph Green doesn't waste any time in his direction of "The Brain That Wouldn't Die". It begins on an operating table with action and dialogue of a philosophical nature. The theme of the film is established at the onset -- just how far can we humans go playing God without suffering dire consequences.The rest of the film plays out as a "Science Goes Amuck" formula with some sexploitationist detours which are not altogether unentertaining, but do detract from the seriousness of the film. Of course, there is decent pacing and a building of tension as the clock ticks. The brain can only be kept alive for "48-60 hours" before something must be done, but then there is more B-film stuff as the plot does thicken. We have henchmen and experiments gone amuck in the foreground as our anti-hero deals with the crisis of the brain that wouldn't die. We have our anti-hero scientist scoping for a body to replace his fiancee's who has just a head, but no shoulders.All the while, things are happening in the basement as the brain of this sweet girl turns into an evil thing with fiendish designs and desire only for revenge against the man who is trying desperately to put her head back on a body. Preferably, a really nice one, but only if he can find one quickly thereby helping science in the process. His fiancee has enlisted the aid of an unseen fiend in the closet and his arrival waits till the explosive climax, although he has already killed the scientist's henchman through an opening in the door where he is fed. The end is hardly unexpected, but shows more than the usual effort for this type of film, especially in the realm of imagination.When all is said and done, this is definitely a "'B'-MOVIE SLEEPER FOR THE BRAIN DEAD"!ABOUT THE DVD:This is a decent single-layer transfer and is relatively glitch-free.

$REVIEW.: If you've never seen this comedic genious (and I don't think I'm over-exaggerating by saying that), than get this DVD as the BEST taped show of Eddie Izzard that I've ever come across.  Originally aired as an HBO &quot;special,&quot; it was my first time to catch Eddie, and I was in pain/tears from laughter.  I'm a tough audience to please, esp. when it comes to comedians, but this show was a wonderful surprise, and to this day, one of my absolute favorites.  If you've already bought this one, be sure to catch &quot;Definite Article&quot; as well. The latter starts out a bit slow, but boy, you'll be holding your sides with that, too.  Have fun laughing!

I love the story between Yakumo and Pai, the monsters, the sanjian... the first part of the series is very much worth owning.The second half... well, the animation style changed, the characters changed and nothing came close enough to the manga for my tastes.  It's like they waited so long to get to the second half that they lost track of the story.  Plus, it honestly doesn't seem to end there, so the ending is depressingly vague.Still, the soundtrack is pretty good, and you have to love cute little Yakumo.

$REVIEW.: Hammer was just about in the beginning of its downward spiral when they went into production on "Taste".  Christopher Lee was already tired of playing Drac and his performance consists of little more than standing around glaring and making silly little pronouncements to no one in particular.  The action seems to take place in spite of him rather than because of him.  Ralph Bates must have hit the coffee pretty hard right before his scenes because he's a bit over-amped and over-camped. It's still full of the lush Hammer treats like costuming, great character actors, excellent sets and smouldering atmosphere.  What it lacks is a compelling story and any particular raison d'etre.

$REVIEW.: If sore muscles mean anything, this is a good workout for those of us over 50 (and probably a lot of younger people too!).  Joel Harper, with his assistant and his mother, takes you through a warm-up, an upper body workout, lower body workout and, with another assistant, an abs workout.  In the upper and lower body workouts, Joel's mother shows the beginner level of the exercise, his assistant shows intermediate, and Joel shows the advanced level.  In the ab section, Joel's assistant shows the easier version and Joel the advanced version.  The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is the annoying little man (a doctor??) who pops up in the middle of the exercises, giving health tips and facts.  I found him distracting.  If you can ignore the little pop-up man, this is a great exercise dvd.

$review_text.: Johnny Depp plays William Blake, an accountant who, through an unfortunate twist of fate, winds up an outlaw, hunted for murder he didn't commit.  Guided by an outcast Indian (Gary Farmer), hunted by three bounty hunters (Lance Henriksen, Michael Wincott, and Eugene Byrd), Blake must come face-to-face with himself, and learn to write a poetry different than that of his namesake...a poetry written in blood...Let's face it: "Dead Man" isn't for everyone.  If you are a fan of Depp's work soley through "Pirates of the Carribbean," you might want to think twice before purchasing this film.  Not that it's bad, or Depp's performance is below par; Depp always turns in a good performance, and this film, superbly written and well-acted by pretty much everyone in it, is worth watching.  It's a bit slow in spots, however, and there were a few details about the ending I found pointless and disappointing.  Overall, though, this is a pretty good film.With cameos by Robert Mitchum, Gabriel Byrne, Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop, John Hurt, Alfred Molina, and still others, you'll get a heaping helping of great acting.  With the black-and-white filming, you'll get a since of old-style Westerns.  Wrought with some disturbing images, counter-balanced by some dark humor, "Dead Man" is a slow-trodding Western that really has no point; it's just a good film to watch.

Tommy Lee Jones was his usual magnificent self, and the grocery store scene with he and Ann Archer was my favorite part of the movie....very droll. There are some sweet and heart-warming moments too, (especially with the cheerleader who has a crush on Tommy Lee's character).

 I LOVED the girls, these gals can take care of themselves and don't take crap from anyone (well, almost) ..

and the script, written by the film's co-director Noel Clarke (who also plays Tee in the film), is very clever in playing out each girl's individual story, while tying up every loose end in how their stories all play off against each other, as well

$review_text.: Having already read the book, I was eager to see this movie
I've seen plenty of movies that have been shoddy adaptations of books, but this movie was definitely not one of them
For those of you who have not read the book, the movie is clear enough on what it is about, requiring no previous knowledge of the book (unlike certain other movies, such as Harry Potter) and if you did read the book, I am sure you'll be happy to notice that the movie remains overall faithful, with the changes being minor

A bit has been cut out, but that's to be expected with book to movie adaptations.Jack Nicholson is an awesome actor, and he really embraced this role
While I imagined Randle Patrick McMurphy to be taller and stronger (and more Irish-looking), Jack had the right attitude for the role, so I can forgive the person in charge of casting
Everyone else also did a great job, especially Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched
Overall a wonderful movie, 4.5/5 stars.

$review_text.: I feel like I've eaten a bag of Doritos after watching Shrek 2. It makes you sick to your stomach and wishing you'd had a regular dinner instead. I watched this only to please a friend who assured me that "the sequel is great entertainment."Nothing about this film is original. Eddie Murphy as the donkey is almost as annoying as Jar Jar Blinks in the Phantom Menace movies. The soundtrack is nothing but recycled, overplayed pop songs that I've heard on the radio for decades (i.e.,"Funkytown", "Ain't Stopping Us Now", "Hero"). The animation is decent but the storyline is as stale as a day-old Starbucks biscuit. We all know from the opening sequence that Shrek and Fiona will end up back together, no matter what happens. The only interesting character is Puss in Boots, thanks to the inflections of Antonio Bandaras (again, not original. That French literary character has been around in literature for 200 years).There is something very depressing about how many people unquestioningly love this movie-sized piece of junk food.Give them recycled music, recycled characters, a cute cat, and they'll stampede to the box office. On the surface, parts of the movie satirize mass consumerism - all the shop signs in the Kingdom are twisted re-creations of the ones you'd see in a local mall - but it's really subversive. It forces viewers to recognize brand names in order to get the joke -"Burger Prince - oh, I get it! It's Burger King!" etc. A marketer's dream - promote mindless mall crap like Old Navy or Gap by making people think it's a game! Brillant!In the same vein, endless references to transient pop culture (Justin Timberlake, American Idol, Mission Impossible) is played for laughs but also for brand recognition. Again, you have to recognize the brand to get the joke. It's a sign of American decline that people are so terrified of watching anything NEW, anything without a BRAND NAME, that filmmakers can get away with promoting processed junk like this.Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I feel the character of Fiona practically promotes obesity. There's something about her tubbiness (more so than Shrek, who is big overall, like a football player) that makes me think the film is aimed toward young teletubbies munching Doritos and happy to have a stomach just like hers. Again, familiarity breeds dollars.In 20 years, this film will be simply unwatchable because a younger generation of viewers won't have any cultural references to "get the joke" and by that time Starbucks and other stores of that ilk will be out of business. Fortunately, the classic, commerical-free Disney films from the 1930-60s will still be well-preserved enough to entertain them.

$REVIEW.: Remember La Femme Nikita?  Or, better yet, Lucy Liu's history in Kill Bill?  Same thing.  It's nice revenge fantasy, and Zoe Saldana is certainly gorgeous to look at, but there is nothing very new here.  Which isn't a bad thing!  A few interesting, somewhat creative assassinations, even though I've seen better.  The blood and gore is a little lacking, not to mention the absence of nudity, limits the impact a bit.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed its simplicity.For a mindless action flick that does a good job from beginning to end a viewer could do much worse.

$REVIEW.: I am a great fan of one of the rightful kings of comedy, the late, great Jack Benny.  He is featured at his wry best, here, along with the stunningly beautiful Carole Lombard--the last film she made before she tragically died in a plane crash.  The title is based on the famous "To Be, Or Not To Be" soliloquy in William Shakespeare's HAMLET.  A troupe of actors in Nazi-occupied Warsaw must get by on their ability as thespians to elaborately (and effectively) disguise themselves, as well as adapt new identities, in order to fool the occupying troops.  Jack Benny is hilarious and Carole Lombard is gorgeous and charismatic.  Don't miss out on this.

$REVIEW.: If you're under 30, you'll love seeing Wild in the Streets.  If you're over 30, you'll be lining up at the LSD water coolers at your local "retirement camp" and dancing in circles with the rest of the "senior citizens".I first saw this film when I was still a junior high school student.  It was broadcast on a local television channel at 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning.  My parents had told how much they enjoyed it during its original release in 1968, so they let me stay up late to watch it.Afterwards I understood why this film was a major success for AIP at the time.  Christopher Jones should've starred in a biopic about James Dean.  Shelley Winters is perfectly cast as Max's horrible mother.  Hal Holbrook is very fine and believable as the naive liberal senator who thinks he can keep Max Frost under his thumb.  The music is memorable, esp. "The Shape of Things to Come".  (I was lucky enough to acquire the original soundtrack on vinyl years ago.  Best instrumental track: "Shelley in Camp".)The plot is incredible, the visuals often chilling -- Max's black-uniformed "age police" with peace sign armbands recall Chairman Mao's Red Guards during the 1966-76 Chinese Cultural Revolution -- and you couldn't ask for a better twist ending.A few questions, though:Is it really possible to dose an entire city's water supply with LSD?  Seems dubious.  Maybe Max & Co. had access to some extra-powerful acid or something.  (In early scenes we see Max as a teenage chemist in his family's basement, mixing up a new batch of LSD.)  Wouldn't dosing everyone in D.C. with psychedelic drugs qualify as a "terrorist attack" maybe?  How many of the over-30 crowd would really go quietly to those concentration camps?  Wouldn't at least the able-bodied folks in their 30s to 50s grab any available firearms, igniting a civil war between the generations?  (The only one we see doing this is Shelley Winters.)  Maybe I've given this too much thought...?  Oh well.Those questions aside, Wild in the Streets is a highly enjoyable example of late-Sixties psychedelia and political satire.So be sure to see this movie -- and be sure to vote for Max Frost for President in 2012!  You'll be very happy in the camps.

I'd even go so far as to say that it's the greatest work of fiction in human history. I won't bother explaining why, because there are plenty of other people who have already reviewed. But if you haven't seen this series, you MUST buy these DVDs and you MUST watch them.

His skills at flying kites and playing baseball are rather poor and gets help sometimes from Lucy, but one day there's a class spelling bee and Charlie Brown decides to be in it so he can prove he's not a total loser. But suddenly as he spells some words correct he wins and becomes a class champion just enough to be in the national spelling bee in the big city, his friends have total faith in him that he could win the spelling bee and become a home hero.Entertaining and charming animated feature that is the big-screen debut of the popular comic strip characters "Peanuts" by Charles Schultz. The movie is a funny and thought-provoking piece of animation with a brilliant jazz score and some good songs like the theme song, this movie has always been a childhood favorite of mine that i still enjoy!The DVD has good picture and sound with widescreen presentation and some scenes that were cut out from the video version and back into the movie. There is a lack of extras but hey that's ok, this is a superb animated flick that kids and adults will enjoy.

$review_text.: The bond between siblings is often stronger than the bond between parents and their children. For much of our lives, we look at our parents as "the enemy": we love them, to be sure, but it is a love that is flavored with adoration and repulsion at the same time.But it is with our brothers and sisters that we can ultimately form a comradeship, a we-against-the-world bond-a bond that is never broken, though interrupted surely, for our whole lives.Director Susanne Bier resurrects the ancient biblical story of Cain and Abel and sets it in Denmark and Afghanistan in her film "Brothers," which tells the story of Michael (Ulrich Thomsen, so good in "The Celebration") and Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas)...two brothers who are as different from one another as night is from day.Michael is an army officer, married to Sarah (a luminous Connie Nielsen) with two beautiful daughters. Jannik, at the beginning of the film, has just been released from prison and is none to happy to see his father awaiting him  for dinner at Michael's home...from which he promptly exits brimming with anger when his father says something to the effect: why can't you be more like Michael?Michael is the perfect son, Jannik is the black sheep. Michael is dutiful, respectful, has never gotten into trouble. Jannik drinks too much, associates with the "wrong" people and has been in jail for bank robbery.Then Michael is sent to Afghanistan, is presumed dead from an explosion and everyone's world is toppled.Bier makes some interesting and dramatic points about what we humans are capable of in times of life-threatening danger and great need. Do we step up to the plate or do we cower from responsibility?Bier and her cinematographer Morton Soberg carefully and thoughtfully arrange the mise en scene so that the intimacy between the characters is palpable. The first scenes alone between a wary, suspicious Jannik and a chilly-towards him, Sarah are gorgeously and thoughtfully framed so as to accentuate the huge emotional chasm that exists between these two people: they both loved Michael and yet they can't initially verbalize, much less physically show how they feel. They are frozen with despair and stricken by regret."Brothers" is personal, hyper- emotional but never mawkish. The acting is of the highest order. Don't come to "Brothers" expecting easy answers and pat resolutions. You won't find them. What you will find is a beautifully realized and executed story about human beings caught in the silky web of living in the contemporary world: a world tainted with war and deceptions both personal and global.

$review_text.: In a reckless moment free-spirited Eva has unprotected sex with her spouse/boyfriend/whatever, causing a pregnancy for which she feels increasingly unprepared. Soon enough Kevin emerges from her womb with an inexplicably preternatural awareness of his mother's prenatal reluctance/indifference/whatever towards him and proceeds to make her life hell for much of the film until his sinister grudge culminates in an atrocity.That is the plot in a nutshell, although the film progresses in a non-linear fashion, no doubt in an attempt to unsettle the viewer so that one feels as bewildered as Eva through these events. The atrocity is referred to obliquely at the film's beginning but it's not difficult to figure out what happened from the barrage of speechless images. From there the first thirty minutes are an unnerving slog. However, once Eva throws Kevin against a wall--does anyone ultimately blame her?!--the film takes a bizarrely comic turn. The father becomes impossibly doting and oblivious as Kevin gets noticeably creepier. And in spite of her paranoia--conveyed, I suppose, by Tilda Swinton's relentless blinking at Kevin's foul-mouthed replies to her every solicitation--Eva reacts with equal indulgence.The film's score constantly wavers between the strumming of a mandarin guitar (which is annoying as hell) or haunted house music or (more aggravating still) various uplifting songs which clash spectacularly with the dreary subject matter.Oh, and is John C. Reilly capable of playing anything other than a complete imbecile?

$review_text.: This was an excellent show on how adults should NOT influence their children! The history and the lifestyle is PBS Gold as usual, but I wonder what the family decider-type-people were thinking when they picked these three! It wasn't really reality either because they didn't have to make it through even one week - or two weeks in the winter
I know people who live in Montana, and that's the hardest part of that beautiful state - winter lasts a long time.I agree with the reviewer who said the Homestead era was great for men, not so much for women

And I don't like admitting this at all, because I consider myself an independent and capable female

But, the females from the CA family made me embarrassed to be female
Really? You are going to live as a pioneer in the year (small clue here...) 1833!!! There's no make up! Also, who would pick a wealthy beyond measure family for this type of gig? At the end, when dad came out of his newly finished mansion overlooking the sea in Malibu - he just looked ridiculous

We just saw the type of life our ancestors lived - toughing life out and doing with what really mattered, and here comes Bob Bitchen who in reality lives in a house that just made him look like the puffed up, look-at-me, I make my own rules personality he truly is
Why did PBS allow this family to continue on when they cheated every single step of the way?? That's not right

And, teaching your kids how to make moonshine?? Really? People chide the Glenn's because of their breakdown in communication, but it's my opinion that the only reason the C


marriage is together, is because the wife is a total doormat to her husband


He is the KING and she follows him around like the newborn colt they decided to sell - because they didn't want to chop more hay for the animal's survival, and because he bought up the store because his family was "starving" and went into the red and had to step up and pay the bill


I can't stand liars
And cheaters - who know they're cheating - are the worst kind of liar

Pops just absolutely had to have his way


Which is why he didn't get along with Ms
Glenn
She is exactly like him.I felt sorry for the poor Glenn children

Watching their parents fight and argue and slap each other with words in the home is bad enough, but these kids witnessed the many arguments knowing this was ON CAMERA
Hello, mom and dad??? Who's the adult here? I hate to label people and places, but when I lived in the South, I saw the same type of behavior: gossip, gossip, gossip, but go to church every Wednesday and Sunday doncha know


And what is it with 21st century women? Especially the younger 20-something women?? Some of them need to step OFF of their men already! Why do these women feel the need to ride their husbands like Zorro - never letting them just...breathe!?! It's funny, the people pickers picked a family where the guy was a chauvenist with the most whiniest kids on this earth, to the family who has Mrs

Cravettes and won't leave her husband alone

He was kind of a bent fender anyways, and the remark about "I should never have became a stepfather." That was beyond not cool

Forget the separation dude, just get the divorce

That attitude should never be allowed around children already suffering from one marital breakup


And Karen could do to appreciate those children of hers


Those kids were the best kids out of all the youngsters on the show

They really lived the life and didn't complain


Even when they suffered losses common to the pioneer family in farming - they still didn't complain.The Brooks were by far the most entertaining - in a positive way


I learned so much from the way they loved each other and tried to be positive and get along
It was sad how lonely it was for them because the other two were acting like the Hatfields and the McCoys
But, I don't think it was fair to include a family that had no children with others who did

It was very much harder for the families with children - so much more work

But, it was tipping the scale a bit too much


Plus, the wife coming in two months into the project - was just too wierd

She didn't have to do much at all except cook and dishes

Her husband had already prepared the hardest work

But, it was sweet how she tried because she saw how badly he wanted the experience


And she did step up to the plate.Nice touches - Adrienne can cook! Her menus were fabulous looking
Because this was in 2001, they heard news of the Terrorist attack at the farms


Adrienne made a flag from scratch
I was a bit jealous because they were so sheltered out in the West with no electronics


They didn't have to experience the attack as the rest of us did
The Glenn children riding their horse to school and how well they took care of the animals


Just awesome

And last, but definitely the best: Mr
Brooks gets a white dress and beautiful veil for his bride


How awesome is that guy???

$review_text.: Before I begin you need to know I am writing as a parent of a 3 year-old who tries to limit television viewing to non-violent content for him at this age. If I was a single adult or childless my review would have been very different.This video takes just a glimmer of the books' original content and makes a whole different story out of it. If you enjoyed this children's picture book then don't assume the video is the same story as I did. If anyone is wondering, the book is short picture book appropriate for babies on up. (The content of the book is innocent and happy, with no negativity or violence.)I bought the video not having previewed it first, for my 3 year-old. It didn't seem necessary to preview a movie that was based on a picture book for children aged 4-8 and was a cartoon type movie for children. I was not happy with type of negative and violent content being marketed to young children. Based on my liking the story book, I assumed the story was the same and good, innocent content but I was wrong.The video is peppered with negativity and language inappropriate for a small child. Here are just some of the things that go on that I didn't like:Olive's owner loves her and is telling her that and she can't hear him. The flea is the interpreter and tells the dog that the owner doesn't love her and wants her to go away. Olive is upset and sad. (That amount of sad emotion seems out of place and unnecessary.)Christmas is cancelled due to a reindeer being sick and children are upset.Olive pairs up with a penguin (a character not in the book) who speaks like a mobster and sells fake Rolex watches and stolen stationery on the city streets out of a briefcase. Penguin explains that he stole the stationery when he was fired from his job at the city pound. One reason given for the termination was that he was smuggling in dirty magazines for all to read. (What are small children supposed to know about dirty magazines? As a parent what explanation am I supposed to give when my 3 year-old asks what that is and why it is so bad he'd get fired?)There is a deranged, mean postal delivery man who hates Christmas since he doesn't like the increase in work load during the Christmas season. He kidnaps Olive and wants to hurt her. Olive escapes and rejoins the penguin.Then they go into a North Pole bar full of nasty talking characters (including reindeer) who proceed to try to injure them by throwing them all over the room and threatening to throw them off the roof. Words such as jerk and idiot are used to name-call Olive and the penguin (who is now seen as a nice, good, character).There is talk of how the North Pole area is in bad financial times all because Santa called off Christmas. Olive ends up flying with the reindeer and saves the day and Christmas is on.I have no idea what the producers where thinking and to what age this would be appropriate. This is nothing like the old Christmas shows I remember from my childhood such as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman. Marketers of the video stated this is bound to be a new Christmas classic-if this is indicative of what our society thinks as good entertainment for young children and classic material our society is really in trouble!

$review_text.: I saw Gabe Kaplan about 10 years ago in a comedy club in Seattle; I believe that it was "Giggles."  I think at the time, he was on sabbatical from playing professional poker or something.  But during his act, from what I remember, he hinted that he wasn't the biggest fan of John Travolta.  At the time I was somewhat surprised, but thinking about it, it shouldn't have been too surprising, really, as the two were co-stars in "Welcome Back Kotter" at the time."Saturday Night Fever" released, making Mr. Travolta a mega-star.  But then, just within the next year or two, "Grease" released, and it could only have compounded his stardom.  He was very young, probably in his early-to-mid 20s at that time, and surely while he was more than excited about it, more than likely it gave him a big ego.  (That was what Mr. Kaplan seemed to allude to in his act.)  Hey, it probably happens to anyone at that age that has that level of success, so quickly.  But then of course, "Urban Cowboy" released later, and that was a really entertaining film as well.  More success, more than likely.I've been hit-and-miss on Mr. Travolta over the years; I think a lot of the movies that he's made over the last decade have been more than forgettable.  But he sure had magic when he was young, and in "Grease," I actually think that he out sang Olivia Newton John a bit, and she was a very nice singer.  He just had that edge that you're looking for, especially for the 50s genre, and his falsetto on a couple of tunes was fantastic.  And of course, he's always been a very nice actor as well.  But overall, he's probably the most talented as a dancer.  Seems like he's a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-some.I finally watched this movie last night in HD 16 x 9, in it's unedited entirety.  Free HBO will do that for you.  And while this film is surely not perfect, it is perfectly fun, kind of like the film "Abba" in a way but surely better.  This is the only way to watch this film.  I saw a bit on "Siskel and Ebert" a long time ago where they were discussing cropping in film, showing what happens -- in a negative way -- when film is cropped from 16 x 9 to 4 x 3 for TV (they don't do this much anymore with the advent of HD, thank God).  But I was reminded of that episode while watching; catch a couple of scenes where you know if it were cropped it just wouldn't work as the background characters would be gone, and their expressions would be missed.To Mr. Kaplan I say, "If I read what you meant correctly, I can understand it."  But to Mr. Travolta I say, "If you did have a big ego, I can understand it."  After all, in the late 70s, Mr. Travolta was almost as big as Al Pacino.

I thoroughly enjoyed these movies featuring mutiny, battles, facinating characters and the rough life of being at sea for the English Navy.  The series follows Ioan Gruffudd on his naval military career as Horatio Hornblower and each movie is an adventure all by itself!  This set completes the series and is put together very well.  I can't wait for more movies to come out!
$SUMMARY.: Outstanding films of adventure!

$REVIEW.: Saw this at Sundance and was very pleased and satisfied to have had the opportunity to view it for it was sold out. This is definitely a detour for Carrey whom is mostly known for doing commercial fare. It is refreshing to see big stars indulge in what would usually be performed by actors without the A grade stature. What really impressed me were the very explicit and heavy sex scenes and romantic moments between Mac Gregor and Carrey. They felt real and tender. I know this film was going to cause waves because even though I watch independents all the time I as surprise to see two A list actors go at it sexually the way both these actors do in "Phillip Morris". I hope this film is taken as an example for other A listers to follow in creating other really original and daring works. Specially applaud Europa, Luc Besson's film company for putting together such and abrasive and risky subject matter.
$SUMMARY.: A surprising departure for Carrey - a pleasant as usual character selection for MacGregor

$REVIEW.: Loosely based on novels by Earl Derr Biggers, 20th Century Fox's Charlie Chan series proved an audience favorite--but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor the studio feared audiences would turn against its Asian hero. This was a miscalculation: actor Sidney Toler took the role to "poverty row" Monogram Studios, where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in 1947.20th Century Fox had regarded the Chan films as inexpensive "B" movies, but even so the studio took considerable care with them: the plots were often silly, but the pace was sharp, the dialogue witty, and the casts (which featured the likes of Bela Lugosi and Ray Milland) always expert. The result was a kindly charm which has stood the test of time. Monogram was a different matter: Chan films were "B" movies plain and simple. Little care was taken with scripts or cast and resulting films were flat, usually mediocre at best, virtually unwatchable at worst.Released in 1945, THE JADE MASK is one of the very few Monograms that approaches the quality level of the 20th Century Fox series.  This largely due to the expert cast and witty script, both of which are a bit unusual for Monogram.  In this particular tale, Chan--who now works for the government during World War II--is called upon to investigate the murder of a scientist working with potentially beneficial but distinctly deadly gasses.  Sidney Toler's Chan is always enjoyable, and he is aided in this by the local sheriff (Alan Bridge, who has the best lines in the film) and the inevitable Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland.)Fans of the 20th Century Fox series are likely to find Monogram's Chan a significant disappointment and newcomers who like the Monogram films will probably consider them third-rate after encountering the Fox films.  Even so, THE JADE MASK is unexpectly good, and I think most Chan fans will find it enjoyable.GFT, Amazon Reviewer

$review_text.: Solid, moving, entertaining movie about life, love, and the hard times of the Civil War


The battle sequences are incredibly moving and depict the gore of war in a gritty and realistic fashion

But the majority of the story focuses on Jude Law, a southern patriot stricken by love and Nicole Kidman, bereaved daughter left fatherless and penniless in a merciless, hard-scrabble time in North Carolina.Renee Zellweger steals the show with her brilliant interpretation of "Ruby"! The critics are silenced as Ruby spits, swears, and melts our hearts in convincing style


Zellweger doesn't portray this character, she becomes her and adds breath and life to this tough-minded, practical, hard-working ragamuffin.Equally riveting is the performance of Natalie Portman as the desperate widow protecting her new-born baby and scraping a living out of a hard-gravel southern farm

Inman visits her and both their lives are forever touched by the encounter.I appreciated the quality of acting, beautiful scenery, and poignant story
Very good film.

I borrowed it from the library, which seems like the only place that still might have a copy. I recall when it was first on TV, I think it was an ABC Movie Event. Sitting each week enthralled in the storyline and then waiting for the next episode. This was the most thrilling thing to ever have been on television and it has stayed with me all these years. I became a life long Nick Nolte fan after seeing 'Rich Man, Poor Man'. I only wish this was on DVD! With all the junk that is put on DVD, why not something this ground breaking???

$review_text.: The team of then action superstar Charles Bronson and bluntly violent director Michael Winner can be forgiven a great deal of the cinematic sins they commited during their career ending days at Cannon simply for giving us this excellent thriller.  Bronson plays a 'mechanic', fancy crime world talk for assassin, that takes Jan-Michael Vincent under his wing and shows him how to do the job right.  The tension mounts when Vincent's first assignment turns out to be Bronson.  Highly recommended.

Really fantastic fantasy. Minor citicisms - would have liked to have seen them dial down the CGI a bit and throw in some more pratical effects... and they should have kept MARS in the title..

 There's a great script, great performances by all the lead actors, who all hit their characters dead-on, and a wonderful premise that is, in fact, based on real occurrences
 The film never degrades to sappiness, and as we watch the father grow and learn, we also witness his willingness to compromise, and his willingness to admit that he had been in the wrong


 Simply a beautiful film about a man's redemption that comes just in time.

$review_text.: When I first heard that Hairspray was going to be made into a movie, I must admit that I was not sure if it would do very well


 I am SO glad that I was wrong.First off, the casting is amazing!  Newcomer Nikki Blonsky (Tracy) completely steals the show with her amazing voice and dancing
 She is going to go far!  I love how she portrayed the character of Tracy in every aspect.I was beyond shocked when I heard that Christopher Walken...the same actor that was in Sleepy Hollow, was in this
 I had no idea that he was a triple threat!  But he really does a great job as Tracy's father Wilber

 He's so funny and sweet...a complete 180 from the characters he normally plays.Michelle Pheiffer (Velma von Tussle) was wonderful as the 'villain.'  She normally does not play the "mean" person in movies yet like Walken, she pulled it off really well

 I knew that she would be able to sing and dance, having seen the movie Grease 2
 Brittany Snow (Amber von Tussle) was wonderful as well; she fit the role to a "T"!Current teen idol Zac Efron (Link Larken) surprised me here

 I knew he could dance since I saw High School Musical, but I know he didn't sing (in the first movie anyway)

 Yet he sang here and in my opinion, did an outstanding job

 I think his hair was a bit overdone though...he looked like he had just come out of Grease, haha


 But overall, he was a good choice for the part.Queen Latifah...well she's fabulous, as ususal


 After seeing Chicago, I knew that she was the only person who could play Motormouth Maybelle as she did.All right, I saved the best for last...John Travolta


 Oh my goodness!!!  He was absolutely AMAZING!!!!  Nearly everyone knows that he can sing, dance and of course act, but who knew that he could pull off playing a 300 pound woman so darn well?  I sure didn't expect him to
 Again, I'm glad I was wrong
 As Edna, he's (she's) so sweet and really makes you believe that he's a woman


 Very well done.I love the general theme of the movie as well


 It was very well structured and portrays 1962 Baltimore quite well
 I like how it touched on the subject of racism and segregation but at the same time the director and producers didn't over do it and make it the MAIN theme of the movie


 The message of the movie was still there: that you can do anything if you try.This is definitely a movie musical that I am going to purchase when it becomes available

 Anyone who loves musicals will love this movie.

$review_text.: &#34;Jennifer's Body&#34; is the kind of film that should remind us all that it takes a lot more to be clever, hip and interesting, then merely spouting a few modern slang terms and a sexy pout
They try to play up a campy teen angst kind of thing here, but it never rings true
It's more like pseudo-angst, thought up by a focus group of Hollywood suits, that tries to play to what they think teenagers would find &#34;cool,&#34; only to fail miserably in the attempt.The premise of this tale, is about how a teenage babe (played by Megan Fox) is sacrificed to Satan, by a loser indie band in the hopes they may be granted fame and fortune, only for her to become a flesh eating demon, because she wasn't a virgin when she was sacrificed


No, really, that is the basic plot outline here.The film tries to come off as an edgier mix of &#34;Mean Girls&#34; and &#34;Scream,&#34; but ends up as merely a putrid pile of trash, that is way too self-absorbed and into itself, and comes across as thinking it is way more clever and hip than it actually is

Most teenage horror-comedies are an extremely superficial affair, but this one is shallow at BEING shallow
There's nothing here beneath the surface at all


No insights, no meaning, no message

Heck, there's no real laughs or scares, either (unless you count the row of 18 year-old guys up in front of me, who giggled at the make out scene with Fox and Seyfried)


Like some vapid teen pretty girl, the film never looks out of it's own self-induced tunnel vision, thinking itself way too smart and cool, and the film loses any chance to be relevant or entertaining


It's not just style over substance, but a self-deluded and half-formed idea of style over substance


Why have a coherent story and plot? Look, Megan Fox is swimming naked in a lake! Isn't that just so awesome?!It seems little thought was put into the script, direction, or anything else


It is merely a vehicle for Megan Fox to look ultra-sexy (in that slutty way she usually does)
No one ever bothers to go beyond this, as everyone else is just some stereotype or cipher character, used for the demands of Fox's character, who looks like she has a totally vacant expression throughout the whole movie (the very same one you'll probably have, after you watch this crap)
The only thing it goes to show, is that Fox is truly a horrible actress and is certainly not up to the task of headlining a film


It takes a lot more than a few cute slang terms being thrown around, and some pathetic attempt at controversy (with a little girl-on-girl make out moment), to make a worthwhile story
Honestly, the thing feels like it was written by a couple of 13 year-old boys, who got a look at their father's Playboy collection for the first time, and thought this would be a great idea for a film


It is just a blatant attempt to appeal to the &#34;teeny-bopper&#34; crowd, who love films like &#34;Twlight&#34; and the like, and has absolutely no regards to the intelligence of the target audience (or any other audience, in general).This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen all year


If this doesn't register on many a film critics and film fans &#34;worst of&#34; lists for 2009, I fear for the mental sanity of the industry


&#34;Jennifer's Body&#34; is honest as a title for this travesty of celluloid, though, as the only thing the film ever concerns itself with is how &#34;hawt&#34; the title character looks
Unless you are a hormone-raging teenage boy, with Megan Fox as your ultimate fantasy plaything, avoid this dreck at all costs! Heck, even if you are one, you should avoid it, as even hormone-raging teenage boys deserve to be marketed to better than this.

$REVIEW.: This forgotten romantic comedy from Paramount, 1951, is a small treasure.  Filled with clever dialogue, unexpectedly textured performances and familiar-yet-fresh domestic chaos, 'The Mating Season' (don't let the stale-sounding title fool you) is a pleasant piece of '50s marital-mixup fun with a strong dose of rapid-fire '40s screwball sensibility.  While I could easily say that the always wonderful Thelma Ritter steals the show, truth is the admirably equitable screenplay (adapted by big pens Charles Bracket, Walter Reisch and Richard Breen from the play 'Maggie') sees to it that all players get their due representation.  Beautiful (though sometimes glass-eyed) Gene Tierney is surprisingly agile in her role as the noble-hearted but genetically snobbish bride/daughter; B-lister John Lund is appealing and appropriately reactive as the anxious, plain-principled groom/son; and supporting stalwarts the likes of Miriam Hopkins, Larry Keating, Jan Sterling, Ellen Corby, Billie Bird, etc., round out the cast with the perfect touches of weight and humor; all efficiently directed by Mitchell Leisen ('Easy Living,' 'Midnight').  As TMS has not yet been released on DVD, a decent, unremastered print is available to watch on Amazon and Netflix streaming for those who've said goodbye to their VCRs.  4 stars.

They don't make  them like this anymore.The famous theme  used in the film  is unforgettable.A pity they  did not use the words of the song as well.Probably because it was a boating song.(jolly boating weather etc)Somehow it fits  beautifully into this  adventure on a train in India. Big question - why did they change the title  of the film for the  bluray release after  53 years.It defies logic.Most films don't deserve a second viewing.This one  does (and repeated  viewings at that).Can't wait for the bluray release.

$review_text.: As a New Mexico native, a movie shot in our state brings a sense of pride, and that may be the way this movie earned star #2 in my rating. Ultimately, the pacing was just off and what was probably intended to be a "slow burn" thriller just felt slow. Don't believe the word "horror" on the cover, either. This is a thriller with almost no gore and no horror.This is definitely an indie movie, the writing and direction were okay, but the breakdown really occurred in the acting (cheesy "psycho chick" dialog) and the movie's pace - it felt overly long.It also didn't help that I mistakenly saw the other 2013Home Sweet Homewhen looking for this one. That flick is REALLY a nice slow burn, bigger budget, horror/thriller, with a nice plot twist. In fact, just see that one instead.
$SUMMARY.: SO wanted to like it...

$review_text.: Absolutely awesome!  This is how I felt about &quot;Gen-XCops&quot;.  A story about three rebellious generation-x cops hired toinfiltrate the underworld.  I recall several director's discussing about the current situation of HK films and how there is not enough originality and they tend to copy or redo something that was popular on many other films.Gen-X Cops is different.  Police Academy this is not.  You get three talented young no-named actors who really kick ass in this film.  Notably Nicholas Tse who plays the character of Jack.  In the featurette included in the DVD, Jackie Chan even gives respect to the man because he also does his own stunts.  There is one scene where he comes out of a swimming pool with gasoline on top of the pool on fire and he emerges out of the pool.  These are just a few scenes that you see Nicholas Tse do.  Pretty boy?  This guy is not afraid to take on risks and this person is definitely a rising star to keep your eye on.One of the things that makes this movie rock is the dedication of the director Benny Chan (Big Bullet, Who am I?). Although he admits that it was difficult to film the movie because the three gen-x actors loved to play around the set and are loud, he knew that was the chemistry that made these guys click and the way the movie turned out, he definitely clicked with them.Sam Lee who plays the character of Alien is so weird and very funny, you can't help but like his character.  Then there is the &quot;playboy&quot; Stephen Fung who plays the character of Match.  According to Tse, a person playing himself...a playboy.  These guys get along so well and are a perfect click which makes this movie even more enjoyable.  One scene has the three friends outrunning blasts in a building.  A scene that they can only shoot once with no mistakes. The only time the three were ever quiet on the set according to Chan.The movie also features our favorite gangster guy, Francis Ng who is a great gangster guy in movies such as &quot;Young and Dangerous&quot; and comedy movies such as &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Star&quot;.  It was a pleasure to see him in this movie as Lok.You'll notice that three languages are used in this movie (Btw, I watched it in Cantonese in English subtitles, I'm not into dubbed in English movies): Cantonese, English and Japanese.  The Japanese star in this film is Toru Nakamura.  Popular for his awesome work in Japanese dramas such as &quot;Nemureru Mori&quot; (The Sleeping Forest) and &quot;Ko-ri no Sekai&quot; (The Ice World).  He speaks in English and in Japanese in this movie but I think it was pretty cool they included him in this movie trying to attract Japanese viewers. In this movie he plays Akatora.  The bad guy!  For those who followed his works, he can definitely play a hardcore bad guy!  The man is definitely a talented actor.It was also a pleasure to watch Grace Yip who plays Y2K and the introduction of model, Jaymee Ong (who plays the character, Haze) of Australia.  Last, you can watch the special cameo of martial arts star, Jackie Chan.It also helps that you have people involved in this movie such as the special effects team that blew up the White House on Independence Day and a professional aerial team who worked with Chan to make one hell of a movie.Some people might get upset about the use of English.  It's not the best and if you watch a Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Chow Yun Fat American movie, you are either used to it or your a person that moans about the English.  Just sit down and watch the movie without zoning in on the language, let the story and the action be the main thing you are watching this movie for.  I'm sure this movie was expensive to make as well and Gen-X Cops in my opinion has a much more of an interesting storyline.I think one of the reason why I like this movie is because I can identify with the three actors and I like how hip this movie really is.The video quality in the film is pretty good and I was happy top see the widescreen version done anamorphically! YES!  Also, the sound is presented in 5.1 (Cantonese and also in additional languages) and trust me, it was a great experience to hear those sounds from all sides of the room.Are there many extras on this DVD?  At first, I quickly glanced at the menu before the movie and I said to myself...probably not.  I was wrong!  After enjoying the movie so much, I then checked out the extras included on the DVD.  Bare in mind it was 10:30 p.m. when I finished the movie.  It was cool to see the trailers but then I watched the deleted scenes and oh my!  It's about 40 minutes long?  Well, ok...it's mixed with parts of the film, so I guesstimate that it was 30 or so minutes of extra footage. Most movies with deleted scenes are about 5-10 minutes long or even shorter.  It was a pleasure to see the extra scenes.  Some I felt would have been nice for the movie but I wish there was a director's commentary to explain why he took it out...but what the heck, they jammed some scenes into this deleted scenes segment already.  Very cool to watch!Now, it's almost 11:30, I have yet to watch the making-of documentary.  This one was pretty long and it was very...I mean VERY awesome!  You actually get to see Nicholas Tse perform those risky scenes and you also get to see/hear the comments by the director and by others of each other.  Also, a comment at the party by Jackie Chan who says something about Nicholas Tse.  Overall, the extras are pretty damn good!  To end the documentary, you get the music video performed by Tse, Fung and Lee.It's almost 1 a.m. now and I'm just pumped up!  This movie was very awesome!  It was definitely much more than I expected.  Also, it is pretty cool to see a DVD out in department stores with Asians on the front cover.  I hope Media Asia Films releases another DVD and I can't wait for Gen-X Cops II.This DVD is highly recommended for action movie viewers.

$review_text.: I've liked this movie's storyline ever since first seeing it on television several years ago. A couple years later I found a "previously viewed" VHS copy at a local video store but was disapointed in the image quality. I chalked it up as the tape being worn out. When I saw the DVD was available I quickly purchased it, certain the image quality would be there. However I was again disapointed. I recomend the story to anyone who loves Westerns. It's wonderful and its stars bring a lot to the production. Just don't expect first rate image quality.

$REVIEW.: There is a secret throughout the movie that only gets reveiled at the last scene


A secret that the viewers dont even know its existence

And at the  last scene everything that they have been watching for the past hour and a  half changes completely its meaning


Because of the revelation of this  secret at the end, viewers have to rethink the whole movie from the  beginning and check it for consistency.I wont reveil the secret, but I  challenge you to see the movie and try to understand what is wrong at all  times
Something that does not fit


And only at the end you will say, Oh,  man , yeah, yeah, now it makes sense

$REVIEW.: Normally I'm not fond of adventure films, especially modern one's which seem to depend more on gratuitous blood and violence than on plot and acting. But this classic version of King Solomon's Mines from the Golden Age of Hollywood is a true classic. Yes there's violence -- consistent with the harsh conditions of the unexplored portions of 19th century Africa -- but there's also splendid writing, plot, and acting. If you want to see how good an adventure movie can be when it's done right, get this DVD of the classic version of King Solomon's Mines. By the way, Stewart Grainger is outstanding as the virile but somewhat world weary safari guide and Deborah Kerr is both convincing and especially beautiful as the stalwart heroine.

$review_text.: David (John Cusack) has never really gotten used to his wife's death


 Years later he is considering adopting a child despite his sister Liz's (Joan Cusack) advice
 His friend Sophie (Okonedo) has the perfect child for him

 Dennis (Coleman) is a child who believes he is from Mars
 He hides in a box during the day because the sun bothers him


 He wears a "gravity belt" to keep him from floating away

 Once home, David finds that it is more difficult than expected to connect with Dennis
 In these tough times, doctors from the orphanage are checking in on things, and David realizes he must make a breakthrough if he wants to keep Dennis.While "Martian Child" is a fictionalized account of author David Gerrold's adoption of a child, one can't help but hope that there were less sappy moments in real life
 "Martian Child" is full of them, just begging the audience to shed a tear at the characters' plight

 Cusack does his usual best with what he is given here, but the script hinders him more than usual here

 Sure there is a nice story here, but it seems to be buried under a layer or two of sap
 This was not a bad movie, but it definitely wasn't my thing


 I recommend this to those who enjoy tear -jerker type films.

$REVIEW.: Says British conductor Alfred De Carter to his younger and adoring wife, Daphne, at the close of Unfaithfully Yours, "A thousand poets dreamed a thousand years...and you were born, my love." Before we get there, however, we are in the midst of one of the most sophisticated comedies of style ever filmed, and we have witnessed Rex Harrison as De Carter give a titanic performance of plump ego, ridiculous self-righteousness and effortless comedy skill.De Carter is a famous, wealthy symphony conductor married to Daphne (Linda Darnell) and who employes the handsome Tony (Kurt Krueger) as his personal assistant

Through plausible misunderstandings he learns a private detective kept tabs on Daphne while he was in England


The detective's report is clear...Daphne spent some time in Tony's hotel room late one night wearing a negligee

De Carter first rejects the report, but the worm of jealousy burrows in
That night, while conducting, he imagines three immensely satisfying ways of dealing with the situation


They involve a straight razor applied vigorously to Daphne
Then the noble use of his check book..."This little head was never made to worry, or these little hands to work." And last, a game of Russian roulette, with his preening wit and a cowering Tony


But after the symphony, when he attempts to implement his ideas...well, let's say De Carter finds himself in an extended scene with disasters of his own ego's making


Finally, with just a little humiliation, De Carter learns the truth about that nighttime visit to Tony's room
With the misunderstanding finally cleared up, De Carter embraces his wife and whispers to her those last lines.Without Preston Sturges' witty screenplay and clever direction, Unfaithfully Yours would be a slight and cold work indeed
Without Rex Harrison's skill and personality, Unfaithfully Yours would be as cynical as a broken promise and as funny as a man who slips on a banana peel, but shatters his jaw on the curb
Together, however, they have created a film of incredibly high style, smart dialogue that just keeps coming which Harrison delivers with precision and malice


Harrison gives a line like "Put on the purple one...with the plumes at the hips," all the demeaning innuendo Sturges could hope for
Even Edgar Kennedy as Sweeney the private eye gets in the act

"No one can handle Handel like you handle Handel," he enthusiastically tells De Carter


"And your Delius...delirious!"Rex Harrison was not only an incredibly gifted stage and movie actor, he was just about the best there was for high comedy

It's no accident that most critics think he was the outstanding interpreter of Shaw and one of the best with Coward

I think he had the best line delivery in the business


What is surprising, because he can be so clever and amusing, is Harrison's handling of the extended deadpan slapstick toward the end of the movie
De Carter encounters chairs with wicker seats he steps through, tables that fall over holding lamps and phones he tries to catch, gloves that won't fit and high shelves he can barely reach

The classic is his attempt to set up the Simplicitas Home Recording Unit, "So Simple It Operates Itself." By the time De Carter finishes, the elegant drawing room is a shambles
Harrison, if he put his mind to it and on a good day, could possibly out Keaton Keaton.For fans of classical music, De Carter is conducting works by Rossini, Wagner and Tchaikowsky while he imagines the three ways of dealing with his ego-damaged situation


As Sturges has De Carter say at one point early in the movie, "There's nothing serious about music

It should be enjoyed flat on the back with a sandwich in one hand and a bucket of beer in the other, and as many pretty girls around as possible."The Criterion picture is in great shape


There are a number of extras, including an appreciation of Sturges by Terry Jones and a commentary track by three Sturges scholars.

$review_text.: Just when you thought they'd never make a mystery thriller as deliriously bad as Midnight Lace, just when you imagined that the gold lame spirit of Douglas Sirk had departed forever, comes director Richard Rush's Color of Night to brighten up your dull evenings. Color of Night isn't just bad: it's bad with raisins in it.If you were one of the few who saw Color of Night in a theater, you probably remember the plot, but for those millions and millions who missed this gem, Let's recap.Bruce Willis stars as a psychologist. Are you laughing too hard or can we go on now? Willis is having a crisis of conscience/confidence because one of his patients leaped out of a window after applying lots of lipstick - we all know, don't we, that applying lots of lipstick is a sure sign of suicidal depression? Anyway, Willis goes out to L.A. to visit fellow shrink Scott Bakula, who takes Willis to his group therapy session so that the fun can start in earnest. Remember "The Bob Newhart Show" from the '70's? His group therapy meetings weren't nearly as funny as these: we have a nympho, an obsessive-compulsive, a split personality, the Professor and Mary Ann - well, you get the idea. Bakula gets killed in a scene that looks like Psycho directed by Mack Sennett. The sad part is that Bakula is the most talented and attractive member of the whole freakin' cast and 30 minutes into the picture he's been bumped off.Willis stays on in Bakula's grandiosely modern home (crammed with screamingly bad art) despite the fact that someone keeps stalking him and leaving snakes in the mailbox. Are hotels in L.A. that expensive? It's like the TV movie where that devil doll keeps chasing Karen Black around her apartment going, "Yanni yanni yanni," and it never occurs to her to just leave.Instead of ruining the horribly implausible and helter-skelter plot for you, we'll just point out some of the more outrageous lapses of sanity: a) Willis's patient jumps out of a Manhattan office tower, causing pedestrians to scream and run, whereas real New Yorkers would have lifted her purse; b) Three days after famous psychologist Scott Bakula is killed in an exceedingly colorful way in his midtown office, his patients still don't know about it - okay, we've already established that there are no reasonably priced hotels in L.A., but surely there must be at least one newspaper or TV station; c) The whole plot hook - Willis goes color blind after seeing his patient's blood--goes nowhere. Period. We kept thinking there had to be a reason for it or a plot twist that depended on it - but nothing ever happens.The film is a laugh riot and we don't want to give away all of the jokes. When we saw the film in the theater, the audience laughed all the way through the first sex scene, which took place underwater and was about as erotic as an Esther Williams movie. Oh, yes, we do get to see generous portions of Bruce Willis, though not as much as he'd have liked.Then there's the acting. Even the extras overact. Keep your eyes out for one unbilled woman playing a hooker in a police station. She only has one line, but she gives it such gusto that she leaves the audience stunned. Even formerly respected actors lose all sense of self-control; Lesley Ann Warren (decked out in a Shelley Long wig) twitches and twitters like a road company Billie Burke, and Ruben Blades does what appears to be a Jose Jimenez imitation. Willis actually seems like a model of intelligent understatement compared with the rest of the cast, but the truth is, he just wasn't acting at all.And then there's Jane March. Ever so much of Jane March. Watching her try to match wits with Bruce Willis really makes you appreciate the bang-up job Cybill Shepherd was doing all those years. Jane spends half the movie dressed in disguise as a teenage boy. I mean, how hard is she to spot? She's got teeth like Bucky Beaver, for goodness sake. (That gal could eat corn on the cob through a picket fence!).It all gets sillier and sillier until the grand finale, which tried to come off as Hitchcockian but reminded us more of Harold Lloyd. Judging by the guffaws from the audience, we were not alone. So, buy this if you're feeling down in the mouth. Just don't try to eat popcorn during Color of Night unless you know the Heimlich maneuver.

Big named stars- an academy award some where in there- and word of mouth mostly critics- and last and the real reason the film would eventually make sense and let me in on if it is really happening or a deranged dream or just a sort of urban legend
NO CLUE! I may try again someday but with reinforcements(friends,family ect) Well I am off to make some hot cocoa to warm up from watching that frozen climate "film" brrrr! If someone does read this and can help me escape this fog im engulfed in

$review_text.: There's a lot of hype surrounding Inside; people are praising this movie as an instant classic. Going into the movie I wasn't sure what to expect. Most of the time a movie with this much hype almost always fails to deliver. But with Inside this movie is well worth the hype and this will go down as one of the greats of the horror genre.Since 2000 I think there's been a lot of solid horror flicks and despite being in remake hell there are some solid horror flicks, but with that said there are also many problems with the horror genre. For those sick of the typical Hollywood horror film or the angry spirit movie and for those who want a no holds barred movie with extreme violence and not some watered down product, Inside is the movie for you. This is what the horror genre is all about and this is the type of movie Hollywood is far too afraid to produce. Right not France is red hot in the horror genre, and Inside is a movie that shows us why.Inside starts off a bit slow, but it's never boring. Though I couldn't help, but think it might be one of those movies with all hype and nothing else. But once the suspense kicks in never once does it let up. This is the type of movie that will have you on the edge of your seat until the very shocker of an ending. After you watch the movie the images will be burnt into your head and it's hard to shake.The screenplay by Alexandre Bustillo was overall quite solid; it's a straight-forward movie and overall quite simple, but very effective. While the characters aren't all that much developed in a movie like this they didn't have to be. The screenplay works well and is always mostly interesting.Directors Alexandre Bustillo & Julien Maury, deliver one of the most disturbing movies I have seen in ages. Their scenes are well paced and never lag. Inside is a great movie, but there's nothing really ground-breaking. But despite they very much deliver on the thrills and chills and also deliver on some brutal violence. Most of the movie takes place in a house and never once does it get boring. Bustillo and Maury always keep it interesting and eerie.What makes this work is you never know what will happen next; Sarah played by Alysson Paradis is pregnant and in most movies a character like her is never in danger due to PC Hollywood. But there is some graphic violence against her through out the movie. It's scenes like this that will shock you and you'll be wondering what the filmmakers will do next. Bustillo & Maury don't play it safe just when you think they won't go there they do. They take it one step further and when they do it really shakes things up and you have no idea what these guys will do in the next scene.Like I said the characters are all that developed, but in a movie like this they didn't have to be. The fact Sarah is pregnant really raises the stakes and makes her sympathetic right off the bat. Seeing what she goes through is just crazy. And seeing some of the violence against her is cringe worthy. This is something you won't see in American horror. Maybe back in the 70s or 80s, but you'll never see anything like this now.Beatrice Dalle who played La Femme is one of the scariest and most sadistic characters I have seen in a horror flick in quite sometime. Some people were complaining about a female villain. Well make no mistake woman or not she was damn creepy and easily rates as one of the most sadistic this genre has ever seen.A lot of people talk about how gory this movie is. Well it is quite gory, but not as much as it's being made out to be. It's just that Inside is so brutally violent that people over-do it with the gore level. This movie is quite extreme in the violence and while there is a whole lot of the red stuff to be found it's not as gory as people say it's just that it's so violent. I recommend this movie to any horror fan that wants something a little more extreme. Inside is a deeply shocking, disturbing and violent movie.Inside starts off slightly slow, but once it gets going it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The suspense and tension never once lags, it's violent and disturbing with a truly twisted ending. Bustillo & Maury push the envelope one step further than any horror film has done in recent memory.

$review_text.: Question: Why buy a cheap imitation when you can own the real thing for the same price? I'm talking about the DVDs of "Reservoir Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction" of course. Both brought to you by a director that understands pacing, acting and directing actors. I've seen a lot of "Tarantinoesque" films, but never one with such shameless disregard of originality. "BGB&O" does have flurries of good writing, but the director doesn't know when to have his characters shut up. Watching this, all I kept saying to myself was, "Breath, man, breath..." Technically, it wasn't half-bad, its low budget actually works in its favor, much like "El Mariachi" (we saw what happened when a large budget was thrown at that very same story with "Desperado"). Like I said, your money would better spent purchasing films that this one tries so desperately to imitate.

$REVIEW.: This movie about a soul-less person who teaches to make a living while looking for a rich hubby basically has no reasonable plot line and an inexplicable conclusion.  Somehow at the end we're supposed to like this unredeemed person because (I think - it happened pretty quickly) she had one moment of kindness.  I'm not actually sure about the kindness part.  Basically stupid and unfunny with an incoherent story.  No matter what she's in I usually like to watch Cameron Diaz movies, but not this one!

The video is good, not stellar, but not bad for a 30-plus-year-old movie that no doubt had been decaying in a vault somewhere. The movie, of course, was made before the discovery of the Titanic itself and its 2-piece plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic. But who cares?

$review_text.: A heartbreaking story of two young gay cowboys, who meet each other herding sheep on Brokeback mountain.  Down through the years, they get together twice a year, for some rest and relaxation.  Jack would love to get together and live together, but Ennis resists because of the social ramifications and an incident that happened when he was a young boy of barely nine years old.  I initially watched this movie because of the titillating nature of the subject matter, but halfway through, I started to understand this is much, much more than just a gay cowboy movie.  I bought it off amazon.com because I'd loved to be able to watch it whenever I wanted to.

$review_text.: Like most, I'm more familiar with the Jimmy Stewart-starring remake than the 1934 original. And by "more familiar with" I mean I didn't know the original existed until a few years ago. Smarter people than I can do a much better job comparing and contrasting the two versions. But I believe it stands up just fine on its own, even while I still prefer the latter version (though an included essay makes a strong argument for the original).First, though, the restoration. It looks incredible. The film could be average and the restoration job would be worth five stars alone. Similarly, the sound is as clean and crisp as you could want. Criterion has knocked it out of the park again.As to the film itself, it's immensely enjoyable. It lacks the nuance of the remake and the polish that Hitchcock developed as a director, but it's worth seeing for Peter Lorre's performance alone, his first in English. A performance he delivered, I might add, without knowing quite what he was saying, as he learned his lines phonetically on account of not actually speaking English at the time.At the end of the day, it's classic Hitchcock presented by Criterion. What's not to like?

$review_text.: The Friday the 13th films have always interested me. The movies themselves are scary but yet are devoid of a real plot,hammered by an extremely low budget,and have really no character development at all. But for some reason, people don't seem to mind this. The movies are entertaining enough,and having a very low budget only seems to make the movies feel more creepy. In Friday the 13th-The Final Chapter (yeah right!) there really isn't much more to add if you've seen the first 3 films. You know Jason is going to rise from the grave and kill some teenagers (or rather people in their mid 20's playing teenagers),and you know there is going to be a lot of gory, grisly deaths.Makeup master Tom Savini returned for the last time in the series to create the films extermely disturbing death scenes. Young Corey Feldman appears as Tommy Jarvis, a 12 year old obsessed with video games and creating his own monster masks and makeup. When a group of teenagers rent the house next door to the Jarvis family, Jason returns to Crystal Lake to kill everyone. That's pretty much it plot wise, you see dumb teenagers going outside in the middle of the night by themselves to take a little midnight swim (take a guess at what happens to them..) This movie is a horror movie and follows the formula of dumb characters doing dumb things, but that's all part of the fun with these type of films, guessing how and who's going to die next.The DVD itself is extremely disapointing with the bonus material being nothing more than a lame theatrical trailer. Even the transfer is a total let down. Has it improved from the VHS version of the movie? Sure, but not much. The image quality is in  terms pathetic on how the movie could look compared to other films that have been digitally remastered. The sound is even worse. A flat mono track is the only availabe sound option. Thanks a lot Paramount. It amazes me how Paramount can produce a profitable franchise that was so sucsessful it has 8 (soon to be nine sequels) and not give it any special attention at all. Obviously if there are that many sequels made there is a huge number of loyal fans to these films who are given absoulutly nothing in return. Without the fans, this series would have ran out of steam a long time ago. Maybe someday the loyal fans of this series will get what they deserve. My applause goes to New Line Cinema who now holds the right to the franchise. Maybe someday they can buy the rights from Paramount and produce a collection similar to the outstanding Nightmare on Elm Street DVD collection. One can only hope. To sum up this very long review, the movie itself is worth watching, but spending over $20 on this bare bones DVD? Do yourself a favor and buy the VHS version for $9.99. This DVD would be better used as a coaster. Thanks for nothing Paramount!

$REVIEW.: Most cinema is really just plays on film.  Nothing wrong with that, but when one is evaluating the uniquness of the medium, even special-effects blockbusters can be thought of more purely cinema than, say, a Merchant-Ivory production might be .  "Baraka" inherits its grammar from painting rather than theater, but understands its "movie-ness" as well. It could even be described as a visual piece of music - and here I do not refer to its excellently-integrated soundtrack - the experience is a visual fugue. If you're looking for thrills, seek elsewhere.  This is a meditation, a quiet dynamo that will fill you with longing and amazement.

$REVIEW.: This is a nicely done dvd collection.  Thankfully, all the films are of pristine quality.  Better still, they feature the original French soundtracks (with optional English and Spanish sub-titles), sparing the viewer the horrible dubbing inflicted on the American theatrical releases.  One minor complaint: although the box provides the alternate titles used for the Anglo market, English translations of the French titles are nowhere to be found.  For the benefit of those of us who have forgotten their high school French classes, or who never took them in the first place, they are as follows:THAT CRAZY KIDDO YOU WANT TO DANCE WITH ME?WARRIOR'S RESTHEARTFUL OF JOYTHE WOMENThis collection should not be seen as BB's greatest hits.

The films in this collection from Studio Canal may be concerned with subject matter that's far from profound, and may even bore at times.  The fact BB's mere presence makes them irresistable to watch is reason enough for the 5 star rating.

Shots  are held very long (especially in contrast to the jumpiness of other German  films of the 1970s). This is an impossible film to like and it's hard to  admire it because the stylization is so extreme. Obviously, Fassbinder  chose to illustrate a classic of German literature rather than to try to  bring it to life. But why?

$REVIEW.: A steller cast and a riveting script from a book ahead of its time send this movie to the stratosphere! There can be no doubt in my mind that the presciece of this movie went over the head of most Americans in 1977. Indeed, even in the 1980s as Americans increasingly became the targets of terrorists, people felt aloof to the true threat that existed.Seeing this movie made me realize how porus America's borders truly were. Indeed, even now the borders can be overcome (Although Admitedly It Is Much Harder). Bruce Dern's portrayal of a disgruntled Vietnam vet is the performance of his career. He and Marthe Keller are the perfect antagonists. Yet at the same time, they are not caricatures. Keller also plays a wounded women in the psyche. "Take a good look at her. You created her," Gotell says to Shaw's character as he hands him her dossier. The horrors that Keller's character went through manufactured her into a monster. Sadly that is often the case in internecine strife, yet while deplorable it is understandable. It is why there will never be peace in the Middle-East.The pacing and timing of this movie are phenomenal. It also shows that America would be fine without a DHS. The ATF, CIA, DEA, FBI, INS, NSA, Customs and all four branches of the armed forces will always be enough to strangle the terror threat facing the Americans.This movie is one of Frankenheimer's best. Buy it and you won't be disappointed. I wish he was still with us to make more remarkable films of this genre.A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.

$review_text.: Let's begin with the sunny side of the show. Hearing is much better than looking at this DVD. Marcelo Alvarez can sing the Duke, without much elegance (his costumes doesn't help much in this regard), but I would say he's good at it. The other Alvarez, Rigoletto, does a fairly good job from the standpoint of a singing actor, and delivers lots of power and intensity, though IMHO his voice cannot be considered a beautiful instrument. Inva Mula is the star of the show, she sings with intensity and ringing power, portraying a much more strong character Gilda than the usual. Sparafucile Konstantinov is awful in Act 1, but gets better in Act 3, where he appears to manage a Techno-Bar-Whorehouse. Sister Maddalena Surguladze is quite hot. Lopez-Cobos and the Liceu forces deliver standard, decent performance.Now the dark side. Stage director Vick presents us not the renaissance court in which Verdi inspired (a too "obvious" layout?), but a strange place instead, difficult to locate in space-time, where everything is somewhat unpleasant, or just plainly ugly. Vick's success on the point is complete: this is the ugliest Rigoletto I've experienced. Bad taste floods the stage, and our attention is permanently distracted towards unimportant but sordid details. Let me tell you about.Poor Rigoletto, in addition to be a hunchback, suffers from neurofibromatosis (remember the Elephant Man?), so his head is badly deformed also, and some bloody tissue hangs around his right eye... Yeah, you don't want to look at Rigoletto's close ups, believe me. In Act 1 duet with Gilda, he pulls his shirt away so you can watch his naked hump (a huge one), and then his daughter gets a sponge and some water and tenderly washes it (yes, the hump). And so on. Monterone appears on Act 2 not between two guardians, but surrounded by five or six "cortigiani", who are laughing and playing their swords against him, like a bunch of naughty boys. Thus, his imposing personality and his tremendous effect on Rigoletto is lost. Finally, when Sparafucile gives Rigoletto the bag with Gilda's severely wounded body inside, Rigoletto repeatedly punches the bag, hard, very hard, with fists and feet! So it's a miracle how can she still sing "Lassu in ciel" before dying.Widescreen picture is rather low-definition, sound image is OK. Dolby 5.1 and DTS will throw to your speakers every damned bump or thump generated on the stage, so put them away and stick to PCM Stereo.If you're looking for a serious, heart touching, no-nonsense Rigoletto on DVD, you're out of luck. MacNeil at the Met could still be the best one around, and that's to say nothing interesting came along in the last 30 years. Let's keep on waiting.

The bonus is that, besides Skarsgard in a stellar performance,  I got a tightly woven psychological drama, unlike anything made in the US  these days.Set in a bleek Norwegian backdrop (a European `Affliction'  like setting), Skarsgard's police inspector Engstrom finds his own word  unraveling after he shoots and kills his partner on a murder investigation.  His decision to cover up his own involvement will lead him to a personal  implosion of sorts.Stark, raw, Insomnia is challenging as a visceral  experience.I enjoyed it and recommend it.

$review_text.: If it wasn't for the perverted old man and the language, this would probably be a really good children's movie.  Who knows, maybe it's intended to be...Anyway, little Masao lives with his grandmother and has never met his parents: his father is dead and his mother ran away.  He knows where his mother lives, however, and wants to go visit her over the Summer, so his kindly neighbor conscripts her profligate husband to take him.  "Mister", as Masao calls him, doesn't make the ideal companion with his absurd behavior and his verbal abuse, but they go off to adventure anyways and learn to really connect with each other.The power this film has lies mostly in its contemplative approach.  It's very humorous and isn't really slow, but the camera does take the time to linger on locales, faces, and characters.  For a few odd parts here and there, it's still really innocent and it seems to show that most people are kind-natured at heart, even when they project an aura of toughness and abusiveness.  An interesting aside to analyze that theme would be the carnival scene, where people intrusted with family entertainment turn out to be violent cheaters, whereas even the heavy-metal biker folk are more than willing to go out of their way to help Masao.The film itself is from Masao's perspective, as a childhood's slightly photographic memory comes into play, mixed a lot with colorful imagination.  The humor is the best part, as it is at times really simple but holds itself up well.  There's a lot to enjoy in this film.--PolarisDiB

$review_text.: John Sayles' &quot;Limbo&quot; is not as good as it could have been. It starts very well. The first hour tries to capture the mood of the people living in the lonelyness of Alaska, and it succeeds. Additionally, a  romance developes between the two key characters.Unfortunately, Sayles'  film makes a very bad step at the beginning of the second half. He wants  his three main characters to be lost on an island so that they can have all  sorts of crises. The plot construction to get them there is contrived  beyond believe and the film never recovers from then on.The picture has  a very surprising and inconclusive ending. This can be called brave, but I  had the uncanny feeling, that Sayles just didn't know how to write himself  out of this mess and the ending is a sign of his desperation. Of course I  can be wrong.I think &quot;Limbo&quot; should have stayed on the track  it followed in the first half. Maybe it would have been a great movie then.  John Sayles has sometimes the habit to make his films too &quot;rich&quot;  for their own good. The result is that the movies are sometimes a bit  unfocused. &quot;Lone Star&quot; is also a film that has perhaps one or two  subplots too many. Maybe he should try to film a screenplay written by  someone else.

$review_text.: While waiting for his wife to arrive at Dulles Airport in Washington D.C., Lt


John MacClaine (Bruce Willis) discovers that high-IQ right-wing terrorists are prepared to take back a deposed Central American dictator who is prisoner on a cargo flight headed for the airport
The terrorists (led by William Sadler) take over a nearby independent church and use equipment to disable the power in the controls tower

The control tower is given enough time to alert planes above not to land and to remain circling with low fuel

The terrorists demand that they let dictator (who is biding his time before he takes over the cargo plane) land in an isolated runway so that they may take a fully fueled jet to escape with him


Otherwise, they threaten to cause the planes to crash by masquerading as the control tower and making the planes equipment indicate that they are higher than they really are

In effort to rescue his wife on one of the planes, he battles the terrorists however he can, while dealing with the useless, foul-mouthed chief police officer (Dennis Kranz).Die Hard 2 is highly enjoyable and maintains your attention like the first film
However, be warned that some of the characterizations are slightly flatter than the ones in the first film

If this doesn't bother you, than you should enjoy the exciting action scenes and the twist-filled plot.If you like this film, I also recommend Executive Decision and Air Force One.Rated R for extreme graphic violence, strong language, and nudity.

$REVIEW.: Good Night Gorilla is the headliner for this DVD collection, but the 'more stories' are also very nice
The book itself is an instant favorite, right up there with GOOD NIGHT MOON
While reading to a child yourself is always preferable, it is not always possible, and this DVD fills in very nicely
Highly recommended for  children 2-7, although older children might enjoy it as well.


$SUMMARY.: Very nice collection of children's classics

$review_text.: Starving people who don't eat, magically transforming dirt into rabid dogs... is this a Tim Burton movie, oh, it's not. Does it appear to be a remake of a half dozen different Wrestling/MTV productions spanning back a few decades?  Absolutely.I wondered what all the fuss was about.  It was about a bunch of book geeks getting their book turned into a movie.  I think this movie falls into the same phenomenon as the Twilight series (whatever all that is really about).What's funny is a movie like Battleship gets such a horrible rating, but people are trying to call this a movie of the year?  It's hilarious.  I liked the actors, their acting was exceptional at times, the story was timid and very horribly written screenplay felt too overproduced.  It fell short on believability, things were just weirdly random and seemed to have very little reason other than to be part of the visual experience. The pacing was pretty decent for most of it.I'm very generous when it comes to movies.  I tend to go in having no expectations and come out at least somewhat pleased.  I went in without any expectations and came out displeased.  I was wondering what the point to even having the movie was.  Oh, to celebrate a book that's probably popular for good reason.Maybe there needs to be a 3 or 4 hour directors cut.  I don't know.  What I saw on the big screen can stay there.  It was too shallow and cliche' for my tastes.  I have a hard time even calling this science fiction. It's more like a fantasy movie without much of a fantasy.

$REVIEW.: I've looked and looked! One of the most popular Hollywood urban legends, I know what scene you're supposed to see the hanging corpse of a suicidal munchkin but I can never find it! Oh well, I guess that's why they're called urban legends. Anyway, I don't think there's ever been a movie that's been referenced, homaged, parodied or quoted as much as this one. I'd even go as far as to say this was probably one of the first movies I ever saw (but I also have conflicting memories of Snow White and Dumbo). I probably won't say much about this movie seeing as how everybody and their mother has said just about everything there is so I'll try not to repeat anything. The actors are great, the songs are memorable and the story simple yet charming. I've never read the original book so I don't know how much was changed. The only two things I know of that were changed from book to screen was the exclusion of the Witch of the South and the color of the slippers from silver to ruby (silver being to hard to film in color against the yellow brick road, I assume) so maybe one day I'll give it a go. The special effects are great, even in today's CGI world, I prefer the practical effects, especially the make-up used on Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion. One thing that puzzles me though is why people are afraid of the Wicked Witch. She's a good villain and all but as a child I never felt scared by her. Oddly enough though I WAS scared of the Wicked Queen from Snow White but wasn't scared when she transformed into the old hag. Yeah that is a bit strange; the Wicked Witch, Danny DeVito's Penguin and Lord Zedd (the Power Ranger villain who was so scary he gave children nightmares and soccer moms complained) don't scare me at all yet a queen whose only goal is to kill a young girl just to be the most beautiful woman in the land does. I've also never seen the musical Wicked but from what I heard about the story, they try to humanize the Wicked Witch. Great job guys on trying to lessen the impact on a character that's been scaring children since 1939! A great classic movie that'll continute to charm each new generation that watches it. I know I'll give it a few more in the future.

They work in the high tech industry of cell phone development. While working for Jock, Adam meets a former conquest Emma (Amber Heard) who was not impressed with his cheese fries or anything else.Adam finds himself caught between the proverbial rock and hard place as he is trapped by slick gadgetry, which unlike anything I have seen, never has a glitch. He has no choice but to use what he has learned to fight back as he wants out.The film uses technology that is available today, hacking, GPS, facial recognition software, etc to modernize an old twisty script. How well you enjoy this film might be determined by age, gender and love of electronic gadgets.A drama thriller that might be worth a rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No nudity.

$REVIEW.: Ralph Fiennes plays the handsome Hungarian Count Laszlo Almassy who is a quiet, intense, sensitive educated man

His complicated life is unraveled thread by thread in this deeply inspiring, adventurous and biographical film about love and survival

He awakens in a British hospital without identification and is simply called "the English patient"


His face is scarred beyond recognition, his hands are contracted from scar tissue ..

The haunting exotic lyrics to the song "Szerelem Szerlem" (Love Love) as sung by Marta Sebestyen is heard occasionally throughout the film

It very appropriately symbolizes the basis of his actions and life story
Count Almassy demonstrates courage, resourcefulness, and integrity when he does everything in his power to keep is word and rescue the life of the woman he loves, Katherine Clifton played by Juliette Binochet

In the end, whatever he did was just not enough ..
yet he survived.The film begins in Indiana Jones fashion, the cinematography is outstanding as two biplanes fly over mountains and sand dunes ..
visible as far as the eye can see
The views are stupendous! Count Almassy is a pilot who leads a British group to some mountains which were described by a Bedouin


They discover a cave which has magnificent archeological value: simple drawings on the walls of ancient man's activities ..


Katherine Clifton, the wife of a British mapmaker, is captivated and makes drawings which she offers to Laszlo Almassy

There is an interesting tension between them which later in the film develops into intense feelings of love upon which most of the story is based
Other memories surface of the sand dunes, Count Almassy is rescued by Bedouins who cover his burned face with a wet cloth, wrap his body in a blanket, place him on an immmobilizer and transport him to their camp where they treat his wound with unguent and herbal remedies, essentially saving his life ...The story line unfolds in different time segments, as the memories of the English patient awaken ..


this makes the film especially interesting and provides unique perspectives and reveals his life story in a more suspense-filled and intriguing manner
After World War II is declared over, he is transported in Italy by the Allies ..


prior to crossing bridges and along the roads, several soldiers check for buried unexploded land-mines left by the enemy

Hanna who is the nurse caring for the English patient lends money to a girlfriend who happily joins a group that will celebrate in town


Within minutes, her jeep explodes from a bomb which kills all the passengers

Hannah is so overcome by her friend's death she runs to the site and starts walking to the wreck ..


the mine sweepers stop her so she is not injured right after she retrieves her friend's gold bracelet.After the explosion, Hanna (Kristin Scott Thomas) wants to settle in a monastery she spied on a hillside to care for the English patient until help arrives to rescue them
She talks the mobile hospital unit into moving him into one of the empty rooms of the bombed out building
They leave her to her ministrations
The English patient has a book which he cherishes
It is filled with a few items and momentoes of his past life


He opens up and talks about his life to Hannah as she asks him about the significance of his souvenirs


He reveals his deep relationship with Catherine and how it developed ..

They acquire another guest Carravegio, a self-described thief who knew one of Hanna's nurse friends and who comes to learn the identity of the English patient


His original plans were to strangle the English patient, whom he suspected was a German spy but after he learned the circumstances of why he had given maps to the Germans his feelings for revenge evaporated
The thief described his experiences during the war which included some graphic torture scenes (I had to close my eyes, I just could not watch it) ...Hanna is shown to be a vulnerable sensitive nurse who needs to feel love and companionship


She develops a relationship with one of the Sikh soldiers named Kip who was a minesweeper


One of the most beautiful scenes in the films is when Kip rigs a pulley system with a seat to show her the artistic murals on the walls of a local church ..


However, after Kip's coworker and minesweeper friend dies in an explosion, he withdraws into himself and the relationship with Hanna dissolves


Hanna begins to accept that at times she needs to just let go of people about whom she cares and loves

She learns to accept it is not within her power to correct and solve every problem

This is a very powerful film that touches many emotions within the viewer


It shows how the human spirit can overcome many adversities when the power of love is unleashed


It is no surprise the film won nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture of the Year ..
word descriptions are not nearly adequate to describe the true impact of viewing it

$REVIEW.: First of all, if you're a Bierce fan, you won't tolerate a lame Hollywood version of the man

You won't be disappointed; Campbell Scott does a great job: He's obtuse and cynical--everything we expect from Bierce.The three stories are beautifully filmed and acted

In the first segment, "One Kind of Officer," the battle scenes go on too long, but the story's payoff makes up for it

The second segment, "Story of a Conscience," is perfectly realized--the best of the three, in my opinon


The third, "Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge" is, of course, the most famous story


It's well done, and it includes story details that were missing from the award-winning 1962 Enrico film
Nevertheless, it doesn't have the emotional impact that the Enrico film had

Enrico nailed the climactic moment so well, I don't think anyone could ever do it better.I hope this film, even though it obviously had limited distribution, will inspire uninformed viewers to get into Bierce

He was such an outrageous character (no less than eight biographies have been written) that his life often overshadows his work--but that's part of the fun.These filmed versions of Bierce's stories really stay true to his intention: to show what an utterly foolish and misguided creature is man, with war being the greatest evidence of his folly.Plus, it's great to see Bierce hanging out with his employer / nemesis, William Randolph Hearst
Great stuff!

$REVIEW.: Even though I delayed to see it in the theatres (I rented it when the DVD was released), I say it's better late than never
All I can say is that I love how original it is in telling a love story
The characters are well done with both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet making a good impression with them

And some scenes were touching with Jim Carrey's character reliving some beautiful moments that he had forgotten how much they meant to him


While it's not as inventive as "Being John Malkovich", or as clever as "Adaptation", I think this is still Charlie Kaufman's best screenplay because it has a light charm that wasn't in the others, and plus his characters are more rich in seeming like real people in a crazy situation

There's a lot of good elements to this movie that shouldn't be overlooked

I'm hoping it gets nominated for majors from the Academy Awards(Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Actress, and maybe Editing) because it's a beautiful movie that's hard to get out of your head at the end


It shows the beauty of starting anew

I hope the movie industry continues to create and reward more inventive films like this

$review_text.: &quot;Babylon Five&quot; was probably one of the best--if not the best--science fiction show on television in the 1990s.  While most of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series kept on safe ground, B5 moved into territories unknown or unwilling to go in Roddenberry's world.  While much of B5 owes much of its allure to its use of symbols and ideas from other myths and sources--like the Arthurian tales and JRR Tolkien--it also built a new world, a dangerous one and, often or not, a humorous one.The first season is, in a sense, a prelude to the whole drama--themes are announced, characters introduced, and the well-known arc begins with the special questions of &quot;who are you? . . . what do you want?&quot; and moves on from there.  It is a necessary part of the story and, if a bit different because of Sinclair's presence--one which would be missed in season two--the feel is still one of a fine beginning.

$REVIEW.: This film did not do great box office business, and it did receive a few reluctant Oscar nods, which is a waste, since it is certainly one of the best films I have seen on the creative process, fate, and life's more complicated decisions.Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances in years as Grady Tripp, an English professor and published novelist, who has been writing his follow-up for seven years. In the meantime, his latest trophy wife has left him, and he has been having an affair for years with Sara Gaskell, very well-played by Frances McDormand, who happens to be married to the English Department's Dean.Enter James Leer, a very witty name for the character very well played by Tobey Maguire. James does, indeed, leer from the background. He is Grady's best student, a brilliant writer who seems to craft his work with amazing ease. He is also a compulsive liar, and he drags Grady into a crazy set of circumstances and, eventually, revelations.Robert Downey, Jr. does a great comedy turn as Grady's editor, Terry Crabtree, who arrives awaiting the novel that Grady simply cannot stop writing. The book has stretched to thousands of pages, and Grady cannot find a conclusion to his novel or to his life.The direction by Curtis Hanson is understated and superb, and the screenplay, by Steven Kloves adapted from the novel by Michael Chabon, is witty and fast-moving. There are so many good things about this film, and it is a must-see for any frustrated writer. The performances, including a small but memorable part by Rip Torn, are incredibly good, and the chemistry between Douglas and his co-stars McDormand, Maguire and Downey is superb.I cannot recommend this film enough. There are so many nuances that need to be viewed again and again. It is truly one of the best and most under-rated films out there.

$REVIEW.: English-language single-dvd period erotic horror-drama from Joe D'Amato is rated NR for lengthy female nudity, but some of its blood and action and all of its pornographic scenes are missing. However this Soft Touch Video dvd print has an authentic look and feel to it and if you are into Roman History it is definitely worth watching and not expensive. One of its stand-out gore scenes was done better in Patrick Still Lives and Mother Of Tears, but generally the acting and direction are laid-back and extremely good. What lets down this 2004 print is the visual quality in its beach and swimmingpool scenes compared to the 2009 Stormovie mainly-Italian R0 2-dvd boxset 18-rated prints. If you are into this film and can afford it get this one so you know what the players are saying, and then get the visually superior 102m and 125m Italian prints(sold together). The hard porno scenes in the longest and partly-English print are well photographed but are so long that they may become boring. This isnt a D'Amato gorefest like Beyond The Darkness, and you might find that the 102m version-censurata is the one you want to watch again although it is all in Italian. All 3 prints mentioned are 16/9 and R0. I again commend Amazon for believing, as I do, that if you are old enough to vote you are old enough to watch what you want to....

$REVIEW.: While I'm not quite sure that it lived up to the hype that followed it, it certainly earned it. The story presented in this series is strong in how different it is. It's a slow moving, quiet, character drive period drama. Once you move past the differences and look at the series for what it is, you're still left with something above average.The characters and story are strong in their own ways. While the pacing and humor of the series will try the patience of everyone at some point, the romance and characters will keep you coming back. I can understand someone loving this series but I can also someone saying that they hated it. There is a middle ground though and even though I never found myself particularly attached to this series I was sad to see the first season end. I may not be counting down the days until I see the second season but I am at least left with wanting more.

$review_text.: If you're interested in learning more about Charles II of England then get this DVD and then read "Forever Amber". The costuming and detail is wonderful and Love-to-Hate-Her Barbara Palmer is marvelously scheming and evil. You'll recognize--at least by her distinctive voice--Moaning Myrtle as the King Charles Portugese Queen. It seems just a bit sterile though because most of the scenes are shot indoors. I think I'm missing the scenery of Merry Old Restoration England. Rufus Sewell is a hunk and plays Charles II the way I would imagine. Enjoy.NOTE For Parents: At the beginning of the movie Charles II witnesses his father's beheading. He's directly under the scaffold and the head drops towards his upturned face and the blood splashes all over Charles' II face. Yuck.

$review_text.: I already owned a copy of this movie on DVD, but I decided to upgrade to Blu Ray because even with an old movie like this, the images are so much clearer. In this case, the movie itself didn't seem any better but the expressions on the faces of the actors seemed more expressive than they had on regular DVD.This film was first released in 1956. Little Patty McCormack and I are just about the same age. The Ad campaign was low key and asked the audience to &#34;please don't tell you friends anything about this picture&#34;, or words to that effect. As a child, I assumed there was something &#34;dirty&#34; anout the picture from the way it was being promoted.I didn't see THE BAD SEED until the advent of the VCR.The premise of Maxwell Anderson's play is straighforward. Are some people just &#34;Born Bad?&#34;.Mervyn Leroy attempts to &#34;open the play&#34; up in this film version. It is still very stage bound but it is still very engrossing. Young mother Christine Penmark (Nancy Kelly) worries that her daughter Rhoda is a little too mature for an eight year old child and suspects that something may be wrong. During a school picnic, a classmate of Rhoda's, Claude Daigle, is drowned under very suspicious circumstances and there are indications that Rhoda may have been somehow involved, a detail that no one wants to believe, at first. Christine finds one clue after another incriminating Rhoda and Christine begins to explore her own background to see if somehow Rhoda may have inherited some genetic trait that has set her on the road to murder. I'll stop here and let you watch this film play out for itself.Great acting performances abound in this film, many of the actors having appeared in this play on the New York Stage. Nancy Kelly as Christine received a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance. Some people feel that her performance is a little too over-the-top, but I disagree. Christine's agonizing descent into a near nervous breakdown is the glue that holds this play together. Equally good is Patty McCormack as Rhoda Penmark,a heartless child murderess. Patty earned an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress for one of the greatest performances by a child actress in Film History. Eileen Heckart is unforgettable as Hortense Daigle, the grieving alcoholic mother of the murdered boy, who suspects that all is not what it seems to be. She too was nominated for an Oscar as Best supporting Actress.In addition, Henry Jones plays &#34;Leroy&#34;, a sly dim-witted handyman who works at the apartment building where Christine and Rhoda live. There is something dangerous in Henry's performance which seems to suggest that he is a potential child molestor as he tries to match wits with Rhoda. Evelyn Varden is Monica Breedlove, the Penmark's well-intended buttinsky landlady. Jones and Varden deliver Oscar Caliber performances as well. William Hopper, the actor-son of gossip columnist Hedda Hopper plays serviceman Kenneth Penmark, Rhoda's father, who is conveniently calledaway for most of the picture. Familiar character actors Paul Fix is Christine's father, Richard Bravo and Jesse White is Mrs. Breedlove's brother.This is the kind of thought-provoking film that didn't rely on special effects to entertain an audience. It's of-it's-time but nonetheless compelling entertainment.

$review_text.: Lost has always hinted at time travel, but in season 5 the show's creators finally decided to stop tiptoeing around the issue and tackle it head on.  The new tagline for the series became "When are we?" and viewers were asked to wrap their collective heads around concepts such as skewed time lines in which the characthers' futures became their pasts, or the idea that the past can't be changed.  But all of the headache inducing (for the characthers as well as the viewers) time travel only served to enhance the drama and make the series more intriguing as it began setting the table for its final season.Season 5 picks up where season 4 ended:  the island has disappeared after Ben turned the magic donkey wheel.  Meanwhile it was revelaed that Locke had made it off the island only to end up committing suicide; but not before trying to convince the Oceanic 6 to return and fulfill their destinites.We quickly learn that the fate of those who remained on the island.  After Ben's departure, the island started moving through time.  Daniel Farraday likens the movement to a record skpping, a connection that devoted fans will immediately draw to the series' ongoing motiff of records and turntables.  As the Losties travel through time, they begin to experience some undesired side effects which include headaches and bloody noses.  Why is the island moving?  What will stop it?  Why are the survivors suffering the strange effects?  Don't worry, some answers are provided.Meanwhile, the Oceanic Six struggle to return to the island with the help of Ben and Eloise Hawking, a coming war is hinted at, we learn how Locke left the island, Jin is found to still be alive, the losties end up as members of the Dharma Initiative and we finally meet Jacob in the season finale.A lot happens in season 5, and trying to summarize it is almost impossible.  But what keeps the show from spinning completely off its axis and becoming an inaccessible mess is the human element.  The characters are so vividly drawn that we have a strong vested interest in what happens to them.  Especially engrossing is Sawyer's storyline.  This is the season when his development from a hot-headed, selfish and angry loner to an actual human being with deep feelings and a sense of purpose was completed.  Believe it or not, he is the human heart of season 5.The finale provides a a rather large plot twist and puts everything in place for the final season.  Who knows how it's all going to end and what everything means, but I'm on board to the very end, no matter what that end may be.

 Quentin Tarantino is the mastermind behind this gem of a movie, which is in turns hilarious, disturbing, fierce, and ultimately heart-wrenching


 Who knew that a tale about diamond thieves and a botched heist could be so powerful?  Tarantino, obviously
 With the help of brilliant actor Harvey Keitel, who both supported the film financially and found the perfect cast, Tarantino has provided us with the most influential film of the 1990s
 The acting is realistically gritty, the dialogue is delightfully crisp, and the soundtrack is one to die for


 If you love movies, this is an essential view.

$REVIEW.: I was very intrigued with this anim&eacute; ever since I first saw some trailers on Newtype DVD's. I grew even more intrigued when I heard that the animation and CG graphics were all done by one man. So, when I heard this had been released, I picked it up and immediately watched it upon my return home.What I saw was a stunning work of moving art. The animation, at face value, is absolutely incredible, and the fact that it was all done by one man makes it even more so. The music isn't remarkable, though it works and suits the mood welle nough. The director is able to weave a grandiose story quite well within a timnefarme of a half hour. I was afraid that, in this anim&eacute;'s short amount of screentime, the characters would not be developed well enough and that the story would feel incomplete or unfinished. Luckily, however, Makoto Shinkai proved me wrong. There are some ludicrous moments in the story, however. I find it hard to believe that either character would continue to subscribe in a long-distance relationship without fail or without looking at the other options around them (particularly, even when the distance between them can be measured in light years. Even though I'm sure there will be great advances in technology within the next few decades, I still find it hard to believe that a cell phone can actually transmit a signal over the course of eight light years. But, I suppose it's safe to say that a good love story isn't created with rationalists in mind. If you can suspend belief in what makes logical sense, or in other words, you're a romantic, you'll enjoy the story.One reviewer compared it with the greatness of Evangelion, though I'm not sure if this is an appropriate comparison. Evangelion and Voices of a Distant Star are both astounding works, but they are also completely different. I would classify this as a moving story with a remarkable emotional punch, one that will be viewed by few people, yet will undoubtedly profoundly affect the few who do watch it. Thus, I would compare it to the greatness of &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; or &quot;Now and Then, Here and There.&quot;The short animated film, &quot;She and Her Cat,&quot; which was directed by Makoto Shinkai as well, is unique, mildly perplexing, and an excellent addition.As it is, I would give this remarkable DVD 4 stars.However, the reason why this got a three and not a four is the responsibility of ADV films, the distributor of this film. I'm not one for english voice dubs; I hardly ever choose dubs over subs (Cowboy Bebop being the unique exception), thus I haven't heard the dub. If you're one for dubs, then go ahead and pretend I gave this 4 stars.Before I continue, let me just say that I'm not one of those otaku that gets offended if &quot;what was that&quot; is used in place of &quot;nani&quot; (which is what in Japanese). I don't look for a perfect translation, simply one that conveys the story in general well enough. The tempo of the subtitles here, though, drove me crazy. Some were far too verbose to be read in time, while others were quite terse. As erratic as the timing may be, I was still able to notice numerous misspellings. Considering how I've never had this problem with the 43 other anim&eacute; DVD's that I have, I think it's safe to assume that whoever translated this didn't spend enough time making sure that the timing and the content of the subtitles was as good as the anim&eacute; at hand. Not only that, but the &quot;Original Production Animatic&quot; was left untranslated; there are no subtitles or voice dubs at all!Overall, it's worth the money if you don't mind a disappointing translation or a very short anim&eacute; feature.

$review_text.: Customers have been asking for all things Chris Pine that do not involve a Tremor brother theme (alaSmokin' Aces [Blu-ray]) and unfortunately this film is all that is available at the moment.A virus has decimated humanity so a foursome with an unknown history are traveling cross country to hopefully find a safe haven. Along the way we get peppered with the usual long string of irritating moments and self defeating actions amongst this isolated crew. There are no zombies or nasty critters anywhere, just an infrequent mixing of other survivors out to save themselves. Pine and Lou Taylor Pucci play the brothers that lead this group, and they both give decent performances. The pace is not meant to be scary, and there is no horror (as the cover art would make you think - it shows the only real "jumper" moment with a dying person zombie look-alike). Some brief performances by Chris Meloni and a couple ofMad Men: Season 2regulars in Moses and Shipka.The 84 minutes seems short, but for what they made the film about in ambiguity and lack of closure or big picture items, it fits. Go in not expecting anything huge, just a slow burn post virus kind of film that throws the moral compass decisions right at you. Not a bad film or an original idea, just nothing takes this DVD to the next level of being really good. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is a solid 5.1 with subs in English, French and Spanish - Spanish language track is included. There are no special features at all. 3 for the film and quality and nothing else.

$REVIEW.: I believe that the luke warm or negative reviews of the New World are mostly the result of expectations. The trailers and print ads gave the impression the film was an action movie. It was Mick LaSalle of the SF Chronicle who prepared me for what to expect---and appreciate. Pirates of the Caribbean this is not. The often slow pace and the emphasis on the love story are bound to leave many viewers disappointed. I loved this film. I agree with the Amazon reviewer who would appreciate it if the 180 minute Directors cut be made available. It was last year when I saw The New World in a theater [135 minutes]. The version I saw recently on satellite and the DVD are also 135 minutes long, not 150 as stated by Amazon. The New World is one of the best films I have seen in recent years and I strongly recommend it.Update April 17, 2010: I have purchased The New World on Blu-ray and the video quality goes from very good on the DVD to superb on the Blu-ray. Also the Blu-ray is the 180 minute Directors Cut which fills in some gaps on the 135 minute version. Including the theater I have watched this movie four times now.

$review_text.: I'm sure someone else has used this title, but it's too good to resist, isn't it?Hugh Laurie is a remarkable man


A product of Eton and Cambridge (which almost by definition makes him an upper-class twit), he's a considerable athlete, having rowed in the Oxford v
Cambridge boat race, a talented musician who plays multiple instruments and sings the blues and one of Britain's best-known comedy actors

Like most people who knew his work before House, I was amazed to see him in this part
I associated him primarily with Blackadder and Jeeves and Wooster, in both of which he actually played an upper-class twit

Yet here he is, not only playing an ascerbic misanthrope, but an American one!However, what his lighter work has given him is a wonderful sense of timing
He delivers House's zingers with great relish and doesn't rush the lines- this is one of the best-paced shows on TV, with the pauses often meaning as much as the words

Laurie also brings out the bitterness and underlying sensitivity of his character by subtle expressions and inflections


It helps that he has the bluest eyes since we lost Paul Newman

It's a brilliant performance that never gets stale.He's helped by being surrounded by a magnificent cast, headed by Lisa Edelstein, Omar Epps and Robert Sean Leonard

They are the perfect foils for House's eccentricities and convey their frustration with and admiration for the rogue doctor perfectly

If Jennifer Morrison and Jesse Spencer, as his junior colleagues, aren't quite as strong, it's only because the bar is set so high.The stories are formulaic, but it's an interesting formula


The supply of rare diseases for House to figure out seems inexhaustible! Around the essential center of each episode, a mysterious ailment which House and his colleagues must diagnose and treat before the patient dies, there are various sub-plots involving House and his colleagues in some way, usually demonstrating House's disregard for convention and cynicism about human fallibility (an early proposal for the series name was 'Everybody Lies')
The various patients' personal lives and those of House's colleagues also provide a rich source for drama

Almost every episode has a touching moment, often when House's better nature shows through the irascible outer crust
Laurie somehow manages to make the character both the biggest jerk you would ever have the misfortune to meet and a sympathetic figure at the same time.This is both the funniest and most moving program on TV at present


This first series shows why, and it's one that can be watched over and over
Bravo to all concerned.

$review_text.: I am wayyyy past the age bracket of the target audience of this movie.  Nevertheless, I actually had a good time watching this movie.  It is wholesome, sweet and quite funny.  Hillary Duff, however lame or teen-boppy you may think she is, she does have a certain screen presence to her and is quite watchable.  As for the role of a modern day Cinderella, she was a perfect fit - A good girl who learns to stand up for herself and wins the prince in the end.  Some excellent additions to the cast were Regina King and Jennifer Coolidge.  These actresses made the film become a real movie.  Regina King is the modern day fairy godmother but definitely with an edge and Jennifer Coolidge - isn't the name enough?  She was downright hilarious and just fabulous, as always.  I was thinking that if I were a teenager, I would have dove right into this movie.  I was thinking about it from a mother's point of view, too.  This movie is definitely risk-free in many ways.  The only precaution I'd have is Cindrella's correspondence with a perfect stranger that she met in a chat room.  :)Even if you're not a teen or a tween, I think if you're fan of a light romance movie or don't mind reminiscing the cute old days of just dreaming of prince charming, I'm sure you'll enjoy this modern day Cinderella story.

$review_text.: The life of a child prodigy is never an easy one, and six-year-old Vitus von Holzen is quite the child prodigy.  With an I.Q. so off-the-charts it's been classified as "incalculable,"  Vitus is already such an accomplished pianist that he would give Mozart and Beethoven a run for their money in the musical genius sweepstakes.  Vitus' parents are justifiably proud of their son and understandably intent on affording him every opportunity possible for him to fulfill his rare, God-given potential.  But how is a boy supposed to have a "normal childhood" when he's eons ahead of his peers in intelligence and talent and when even his own teachers are intimidated by his knowledge?  Small wonder he's an arrogant, precocious little brat long before he's reached puberty (he's already planning on attending college at age 13).  Yet, at what point does a boy finally rebel against his "specialness" and seek the life of a "normal" child?  Well, in a shocking turn of events, Vitus comes up with a way of doing just that."Vitus" is a superb German film that vividly captures the stress and strain of having an adult brain essentially trapped inside a child's psyche.  But the movie also brings into focus the nonstop struggle the parents go through as they attempt to find a balance between nurturing and cultivating the child's talents, on the one hand, and not making a psychological wreck of him on the other.  And how much of their obsession with the child's gift really just comes down to the glory he reflects back on them as parents?  And whose dreams are they really trying to fulfill through his success anyway, his or their own?Brilliantly written by Peter Luisi, Lukas B. Suter and Fredi M. Murer, and solidly directed by Murer, "Vitus" takes us into a world we don't often visit in the movies - that of the mysteries of the intellect - and does so with ingenious plotting, complex characterizations and outstanding performances by a wonderful cast.  Julika Jenkins and Urs Jucker are excellent as the parents who certainly mean well but who don't always act in the best interest of their child, while Bruno Gans provides a strong emotional focal point as the loving grandfather who is the one person in Vitus' life who provides him with a safe place where he can live life without pressure and just be a normal kid.  The two young actors who play Vitus - Fabrizio Borsani at six and Teo Gheorghiu at twelve - don't hit a single false note in their portrayals of a character who is half grownup and half temperamental child.Nobody is a hero or a villain in this film; they're just well-intentioned individuals trying to work their way through an unusual and challenging situation without making a total mess of it all in the process.The script does lose its way a bit in the second half, wandering too far into wish-fulfillment fantasy and the arcane muddle of big business deal-making and stock portfolios for its own good, but that's a small enough flaw in a movie that otherwise provides an abundance of inarguable virtues.

$review_text.: I enjoyed this film and it has a lot of very funny parts.  At its heart it is a formula buddy film except in this movie the buddies are women.  Actually they don't start out as buddies but the fun part is watching the transformation from antagonist to buddy.  Sandra Bullock does her usual excellent job but the film is stolen by her co-star Melissa McCarthy.  What really puts this film into a whole new category is that the leads are not there because of their looks but are real characters.  Melissa is not only far from slim in body and brain but she is perhaps one of the most unattractive females I have seen on screen in a long time and never is such a pivotal role.  In fact Melissa makes the film and is hysterical in her role as a hard street detective.  There is non-stop action from the very first moments as we see Sandra Bullock innocently get off on the wrong foot with Melissa who never takes anything lightly.  This is not an academy award film on any level but it is funny and very enjoyable.  I must warn you though that if the profanity was eliminated from the dialog this would be a silent film.

$REVIEW.: This chapter of the Friday the 13th series is better than most before and after it. For one thing, it has more energy, more old tension, some unsettled scores to settle!It begins where the last chapter left off. Back in the last chapter, our star hero, Tommy, had one mean terrifying showdown with Jason, the notorious hocky-masked serial murder from Camp Crystal Lake, who killed his friends and family. He did what many people got killed trying to do, kill Jason. And to add onto that, he did it as a child. Tommy Jarvis, now 25, is still haunted by visions and fear of his old nemesis, Jason Voorhees. He is comitted to a mental hospital, but therapy is not helping him forget the nightmare. Finally, Tommy decides to make sure Jason doesn't come back. Finding that Jason is still in his grave at the cemetary, Tommy drives a metal stake through Jason's chest in a fit of anger. But unfortunatly, he should have left Jason's grave alone. A lightning bolt stikes the pole, filling Jason's corpse with 100,000 volts of electircal energy (sound framiliar?). Within moments, the diabolical Jason is out of his coffin to pick up where he left off, and to get revenge on the one who killed him. Realizing that his nightmares of Jason returning from the grave were true, Tommy runs. He arrives at the sheriff's office and things go from bad to worse. Tommy is caught in a fix even bigger than the one he was in last time, for now he tells everyone that Jason is back, and no one believes him! Meanwhile, Camp Crystal Lake (now called Camp Forest Green in the hopes that it will help the residents forget the camp's bloody history) has reopened with lots of kids in for a weekend of fun and games at camp. While awaiting in a cell at the police station, Tommy takes on an ally, the sheriff's spunky and sexy daughter, Megan, who takes a fancy to him. Before long, however, Jason returns to his hunting ground at Crystal Lake and the body count begins to add up. Plus, the cynical and rather unfeeling sheriff thinks Tommy is doing the murders and accusing Jason to make people think that his story is true. Realizing that it's time to end it, Tommy escapes from the county prison with the help of Megan to save the innocent children campers before Jason does his worst homicide atrocity yet. But how can he do that with both a skeptical, over-protective sheriff and an undead, homicidal, machette-wielding maniac out top take him down?One reason why I liked this movie is that Jason has an old enemy. In most Friday the 13th movies, there are all new characters each time, not including Jason. Having an old enemy that brings us from a time long ago to now can really add to the twist of things. Plus, I find it great that the main character, hero, and protagonist of the movie is a guy and not a girl. In a lot of Jason movies, the surviving heroic character is a girl, with almost nothing to lose. In this one, they take it in a different direction with a male hero who has some unsettled scores. That what really makes this movie good. Another is that a whole camp full of innocent childrenis in danger. A common element in Jason movies is that kids are not really involved, for I have never really seen a Jason movie where young kids are in the danger of getting killed by Jason. This sort of thing adds to Tommy's determination to stop Jason.

$review_text.: According to common wisdom, the plot of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is incomprehensible. Which is odd, as it actually seemed reasonably straightforward to me. Essentially it goes like this:Thousands of years ago - and apparently without anyone noticing - the Decepticons placed a device inside the Great Pyramid of Giza that can blow up the Sun and harvest it for energon, which they can use to fuel themselves and possibly restore their dying homeworld of Cybertron. The Fallen - the Decepticons' supreme commander, senior even to Megatron - wants to activate the device, but he fears setting foot on Earth due to the threat posed by Optimus Prime (apparently only 'a Prime' can kill him). Also, the device's starting key, the 'Matrix of Leadership', has been missing for millennia. The Autobots and their human allies end up getting involved in the Decepticon plan to find the key and start the machine and the whole matter is resolved in a string of unlikely plot coincidences and stupendous explosions (spoiler: the good guys win).What confuses the matter is Michael Bay's total inability to selectively self-edit. The problem with Revenge of the Fallen - aside from those inherent to the franchise established in the opening movie which it is far too late to do anything about - isn't that the ingredients are wrong or that you couldn't make an entertaining movie with them, but that Bay and the writers throw every single half-baked idea they have into the mix, regardless of whether it makes sense or if they have the screentime to do it justice. In isolation, ideas like Devastator (a massive robot made up of seven lesser ones), the Pretender (a Terminator-esque Decepticon assassin that can pass as human) or Jetfire (an elderly Decepticon who switched sides to join the Autobots, got bored with the war and has spent decades disguised as an exhibit in the Smithsonian) could have made for interesting scenes or story points. Thrown on top of one another, they decohere the story and make it increasingly hard work to follow what's going on amidst the ridiculous number of fireballs being hurled around.Matters aren't helped by the human cast: Shia LeBouf was blandly inoffensive in the first movie, but doesn't have the acting chops to sell Sam Witwicky's plot-inspired descent into temporary insanity, which reduces the middle third of the movie into barely-bearable tedium, though things are briefly livened up by the arrival of the Pretender assassin, a cool idea which is underdeveloped. In fact, most of the human performances are uninspired and uninteresting. There's also a bizarre lack of emotional response to events in the film. At one point a US aircraft carrier is destroyed and sinks, taking with it thousands of lives and an appreciable fraction of the USA's military power, but this garners almost no response whatsoever from anyone. No-one seems to be particularly concerned about the partial destruction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, either.The Transformers themselves also suffer from the problems of plot overload. Compared to the dozen or so in the first movie, there are about forty in the second, and very few have any development or interesting character traits. Those that do get more screentime tend to be lazily-written and based on human racial stereotypes and caricatures which are inappropriate and moronic. Still, from the carnage Jetfire emerges as a more interesting character that not enough is done with, whilst Optimus Prime and Bumblebee develop well over their roles in the first movie. Indeed, Peter Cullen's dignified voice performance does seem to have come in from a completely different and considerably better film altogether. The Decepticons are mostly lacking in any kind of development whatsoever with the Fallen being a colossal disappointment and Devastator being a let-down after an impressive first appearance. The film's lack of memorable villains is a key problem (though hardly the greatest in the picture).What really damages the film beyond all possible repair, however, is its severe pacing problem. The climactic battle sequence in the Egyptian desert (written by someone who's never looked at a map of the Middle East, but let's not go there) goes on for far too long, eating away at screentime that could have been better-used earlier in the movie to flesh out more interesting concepts and ideas, or simply could have been removed: two and a half hours is probably way too long for a brainless popcorn action movie in the first place.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (*) is a spectacular failure of a movie, being incoherent, badly-paced, badly-acted and ill-conceived. The special effects are genuinely impressive and there are glimpses of concepts that could have made for a great film, but these are left underdeveloped in favour of atrocious attempts at comedy or pathos. It's certainly not the worst movie of all time, as some have labelled it, and it's almost worth watching as a masterclass in how not to make a big-budget action film. A tremendous let-down considering some promising ideas and also the inoffensively entertaining first movie in the franchise.

$review_text.: Quigley Down Under is a twist on the big technicolor epic westerns of the 50's and 60's. The twist is that the location is Australia and the issue is the decimation of the Aborigine population by the locals and British military, alike. The photography and scenic beauty of Australia is on full display throughout the movie.There is no question the movie though  belongs to Tom Selleck as the transplanted cowboy hero with the Sharps Buffalo Rifle. Channeling a Buffalo Bill visage and riding tall, very tall in comparison with everyone else, in the saddle, he visually dominates in whatever scene he is in. The majority of supporting cast is excellent with Alan Rickman doing his quirky best to match Quigley in steely looks. I found Laura San Giancomo not lacking so much as miscast. But this is a minor criticism of a movie that is long on action, memorable characters, scenic beauty and a wonderful musical score. Sit with it. Drink it in. It really grows on you!

$REVIEW.: The two reasons I would even give this one star is that Amazon doesn't allow anything less, and when I saw this in the theatre my friend paid for my ticket
 So I got a free trip to the movies

 That's where the excitement ended for me.I was never a huge Alien movie fan to begin with, but even if I was I wouldn't have been impressed


 We have two gross monsters shooting disgusting goo at each other for an hour and a half, and everyone but the girl with the cleavage dies at the end


 Sorry for spoiling the end for those who haven't seen it, but I just saved you an hour and a half or however long this movie was
 I suggested you use that time saved for something useful...like cutting your toenails and watching paint dry.

$REVIEW.: Director Sergio Leone has produced an ambitious, complex, and moving portrayal of Jewish gangsters in the early 20th century.  When the aged former mobster Noodles Aaronson (Robert DeNiro) is summoned back to New York, memories of his childhood gang and subsequent rise in organized crime resurface, as does the mystery of what happened to the money the gang had been pooling since their first days together.  The answer to that question--and the payoff to this fine film--renders one of the most moving portraits of betrayal and wasted lives that I have ever seen committed to film.  James Woods delivers an explosive performance, as always.

$REVIEW.: Rod Steiger is Carl, "The Illustrated Man", a drifter covered from collar to toe in elaborate tattoos placed upon him by a mysterious and magical woman from the future. When he crosses paths with a young drifter named Willie, he relates to him the story of how he acquired his "illustrations" and how they haunt him and have filled him with hate and anger. It seems that each of his tattoos, described to be "alive" or animated but not really shown to be, tell a story of the future, and three of these stories are shown to us. They are stories taken from the 18 story anthology book of the same name by Ray Bradbury.  The first is "The Veldt", in which a couple grows concerned over their children spending time in a holographic playroom programmed with a violent African Veldt environment. The second is "The Long Rain", in which stranded astronauts are driven to madness by a hard and incessant rain as they attempt to cross an alien landscape in search of one of their luxurious "Sun Dome" shelters. The final story is "The Last Night of the World", in which another pair of futuristic parents are troubled by an impending apocalypse and whether or not to administer suicide pills to their children to prevent their suffering. Along with the three tales is the continuing story of the two drifters that frames the collection."The Illustrated Man" is an odd little film. Strange enough is seeing this depression era wraparound story presenting these three far-future tales, but that's just kinda cool, and Rod Steiger's acting is as passionate as always. But, while I don't agree with the many who thought this film was terrible since it was first released, I will admit that it isn't perfect, and this is not a comparison with the source material at all, as I have not read it. My main issue with the film, and it's probably the only real issue I have with it, is that some of the stories, to me, don't feel satisfactorily finished. "The Long Rain", for example, just doesn't have a clever enough ending for me. Perhaps it is the same in the book. The wraparound story of the Illustrated Man himself, especially Willie's side of it, needed something more to it as well, in my opinion, not just at the end but throughout, to be clearer. "The Veldt" and "Last Night of the World" were generally fine, though more fleshing out of their settings/situations would definitely have been appreciated. Overall though, I found this 1969 film very entertaining and enjoyable. Serious sci-fi films from that era often are. The DVD provides a nice, enhanced widescreen presentation with two great bonus features: The theatrical trailer and the vintage featurette, "Tattooed Steiger". There's also, oddly enough, a trailer for the direct to video prequel "Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning". I don't get the connection, but check it out anyway, because that's the hottest Daisy Duke there's ever been.
$review_summary.: If you love freaky anthologies and this era of sci-fi, it's pretty enjoyable!

$review_text.: Having recently read Bob Spitz's massive but delightful book "The Beatles: The Biography", I wanted to check out the Beatles Anthology again, not having watched it in many years."The Beatles Anthology" (5 DVDs; approx. 645 min.) does an absolutely superb job in bringing the visual history of the Beatles to the screen. Here some of my personal highlights of this set: (1) the Swedish TV appearance from late '63, where the band gets asked to do an impromptu additional song, and Paul tears into a rousing "Have Some Fun Tonight"; (2) the madness that was Beatlemania in mid-1964, such as the visit to Amsterdam and the premiere of "A Hard Day's Night" movie in London; (3) the Shea Stadium concert in August 65, with a cleaver pre-concert montage (I also had forgotten this was the first stadium show in rock history); (4) the first intentional video in 1966 for "Paperback Writer"; (5) the montage for "A Day in the Life"; (6) the utter boredom of the guys, but in particular George, in the video for "Hello Goodbye"; and (7) the whole commotion around the opening of the Apple store in December, 1967 (capping off an unbelievable 6 months, started with the "Pepper" album release).The "Special Features" DVD is actually quite good. The best bits are of course George, Paul and Ringo reminiscing and playing/strumming some songs (such as a great "Blue Moon of Kentucky") in various sessions in 94 and 95 (George's story of his second--and last--meeting with Elvis in the early seventies is hilarious). The guys also spend time in the studio with producer George Martin going through various takes of some songs; the disection of "I'm Only Sleeping" and "Tomorrow Never Knows" will be fascinating for true Beatles fans.In all, this is a massive DVD set, but enjoyable from beginning to end, and that's an understatement. As the years go by, this now also becomes a nice time piece for historians looking back at the 1960s culture and society. Essential and highly recommended!

$review_text.: Until the final ten minutes of HITCH, this was one of the best romantic comedies I had seen in a long time.  The premise was fairly original, though in a way an inversion of the Cyrano de Bergerac theme.  The difference here is that instead of an ugly man capable of great love who gives voice to a less deserving, but handsome surrogate, Will Smith's Hitch is a man who is afraid of love enabling somewhat unattractive men who are capable of a great love, an opportunity to express it.  Hitch is a date doctor, someone who corrects the errors in a person's dating style that prevents his meeting the woman of his dreams.  The film revolves around two poles:  Hitch's efforts to help the hapless Albert--an overweight, clumsy accountant with bad taste and music and a hopeless dance style--woo the woman of his dreams, the socialite and heiress Allegra Cole on the one hand, and Hitch's own attempts to get to know (but not to love) Sara, a gossip columnist.  I like the way the two story lines intersect and complicate one another, so that at the end of the film Hitch ends up with not one but two disasters to correct.  Like in so many romantic comedies, the way to true happiness is paved with misunderstandings, and this is no exception.  My only problem with the movie is the way Hitch takes care of his own problems at the end of the film.  The person I saw this with hated the ending even more than I did, and she was quite upset that Sara had not taken what she considered to be the minimal steps that should have been expected for Hitch to be able to forgive her before trying to win her back.  I didn't hate the ending as much as she did, but I do agree that the final ten minutes of the film are much, much weaker than the rest of it.  On an intellectual level I understand why the decided to portray Hitch as temporarily bumbling and inarticulate, but I just couldn't buy the particular way that they pulled it off.How nice to see Will Smith in a romantic role!  And how refreshing to see Hollywood present an interracial relationship!  Granted, Eva Mendes is a dark complexioned Hispanic of Cuban descent, but it is one of the very few times we've ever seen a romance between an African American and a person of European descent.  Interracial relationships are common today, so it is nice to see Hollywood stop pretending that they don't occur.  Smith has never been funnier than in this one, and the scene in which he suffers an allergic reaction to shellfish is about as funny as I have seen in a while (the make up is exceptional in that scene).  Eva Mendes I had only scene previously in a film I absolutely detest, TRAINING DAY (as Denzel Washington's wife) and in the mess that was ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO.  She is much better served in this film, and she acquits herself admirably.  She has a feistiness and projects a confidence that I really like.  Kevin James is a stitch as Albert, and reveals himself to be one of the more physically graceful large actors to appear in some time.  Model Amber Valletta is fine as Allegra, the object of Albert's affections, but since she is quite attractive in an arm-trophy sort of way, she was perfect for the role.  Special mention must be made of Jerry Donovan, who is excellent as the reptilian Vance, who wants to hire Hitch to help him "bang" a girl he had met (Sara's best friend) so that he could forget about her and move on.I will confess that my own personal favorite type of film from the birth of the sound film to the present is the romantic comedy.  I wish as much effort was expended in the making of romantic comedies as in the production of movies based on comic book heroes or remakes of classics or TV shows.  That day may never come, but in the meantime I will be happy to see the occasional excellent representative of the genre such as HITCH.
$SUMMARY.: Great romantic comedy marred by weak ending

$review_text.: I know that in the end `The Family Stone' may be predictable.  Okay, I won't lie, it is pretty much `very' predictable, but there is something more here that really makes me love this film from start to finish.  The concept of a significant other meeting their lover's family for the first time and completely falling out with them is not new by any means.  In fact I think there are at least a dozen or so films each year to broach the subject, but again, there is something about `The Family Stone' that makes all of that forgivable.  Maybe it's the approach, the pure dramatic elements mixed within this comedy that make the feel more relatable, more real to me.  There are scenes of pure uncomfortable silence and or conversation that make this movie appeal to me because I swear it could and probably does happen all of the time.  The dinner scene alone is so unbearable intense you'd almost forget you're supposed to be watching a comedy.  `The Family Stone' is for lack of a better word a `dramedy' in that it has it's moments of comedic bliss but it never loses it's foundation of real life drama.  No matter how funny the movie may get the audience is always aware that this is real life and real life isn't always a good time.The film follows Meredith Morton, an uptight business woman who is meeting her boyfriend's family for the first time over the Christmas holiday.  Well, she has met his youngest sister once before, but that didn't go so well, so she's ultimately dreading meeting the entire lot of them.  Her boyfriend Everett knows that his family is a little difficult but he really wants this weekend to work out since he's planning on asking his mother for `the family stone', an engagement ring she promised him when he found `the one'.  Everett's family is eccentric, especially compared to Meredith, and this alone makes her a bit uncomfortable.  She can sense the dislike in Everett's sister Amy's eyes and can tell that Everett's parents, particularly her mother Sybil, think her strange.  Everett also has a sister Susannah and a brother Thad but it's his brother Ben who really makes the largest impression, not just on Meredith but on the movie itself.  Luke Wilson has never been an actor I'd call truly talented.  Sure, he's had his films where he was tolerably funny, but here he reaches new highs for me.  I'm not saying he's Oscar worthy, but he sure is best in show.So, as the days tick by Meredith butts heads with everyone in the household one by one.  So much so that she insists on leaving to stay in a hotel and has her sister Julie come down to stay with her for moral support.  Julie, a stark contrast to her sister, is immediately welcomed into the arms of the Stone household and this is almost too much for Meredith to bear.  Everything she says is taken the wrong way and used against her while everyone is free to speak to her how they like.  It's funny because my wife and I had too very contrasting opinions about this film and who was `in the right'.  I felt that the Stone family was way too hard on Meredith who was just a little different but an all around good person.  My wife felt that Meredith was too stuck up and needed a reality check.  You can make your own assumptions.The acting here is what makes the film endearing.  It truly is a great cast of actors.  Sarah Jessica Parker is phenomenal as Meredith.  I personally never watched `Sex in the City' regularly, and the few films I've seen with Parker were less than impressive, but here she truly shines.  Diane Keaton is another shining star.  Her performance is far from her best but she gives her character enough warmth to balance out her hysterics.  I mentioned already how Luke Wilson is best in show here, and I mean that wholeheartedly.  Claire Danes, an actress with whom I am eternally smitten, is only in the film for a short while but her few scenes are well done and effective.  Rachel McAdams is a young actress on the rise and her performance here is fresh and witty and impressive.  She plays the perfect little sister, flawed yet lovable.  Craig T. Nelson is not used as strongly as he could have been but he does have one very commanding scene (that uncomfortable dinner scene I was talking about) where he's used to his full.  Brian J. White, who plays Thad's lover Patrick, does a great job with what little screen time he's given.  His character is one that is sympathetic and understanding, one that seems to feel for Meredith's situation.  Elizabeth Reaser and Tyrone Giordano are not really used much here.  Their characters fall into the backdrop, especially Reaser's character of Susannah.  Same can be said for Dermot Mulroney who is not the strongest of actors and who seems to take a backseat to just about everyone else.The film, while not as original as it could have been, still delivers in many areas.  In fact it's one of my favorite films of 2005, a film that I can seriously watch again and again and enjoy it immensely.  Sure, it has its flaws, but what film doesn't.  I won't deny it's imperfections but there's something warm and raw about `The Family Stone', and that quality makes me come back for more.
$review_summary.: There's just something about this film that warrants my love and attention...

$REVIEW.: It is notable that Elvis made a movie reflective of his patriotic service. On the other hand, in light of the fact that he actually decided AGAINST performing in &quot;Special Services&quot; while in the Army, it must be  assumed that he was uncomfortable in unintentionally &quot;exploiting&quot;  his military experience. So despite the amazing financial success of the  movie and soundtrack album, it must also be assumed that Presley wanted to  get the whole thing behind him and pursue serious movies, picking up the  pace from the 1958 black and white classic, &quot;King Creole&quot;.  (Ofcourse he made two consecutive impressive dramas following this mild  musical). But whatever misgivings he might have had with the tired and  predictable plotline (his character reluctantly gets involved with a bet  that he can't win a date with a dancer) he certainly seemed to enjoy  performing the songs - his vocals are terrific on all the tunes, especially  on the classically-based &quot;Tonight Is So Right For Love&quot;, and the  bouyant rocker &quot;Shoppin' Around&quot;. The production numbers are  particularly colorful and well presented. Juliet Prowse's dancing sequences  are effective, though more &quot;adult&quot; oriented than one might  expect. So if you can stand watching Elvis in a 1950 movie made in 1960, go  for it - enjoy the music.
$SUMMARY.: Not exactly &quot;Elvis Is Back&quot; on the MOVIE side.

$REVIEW.: This movie is great! It's a hilariously cute movie with a fun and talentedcast, a whitty script, and ultimately an adorable love story. A coming outstory with the most clever of twists, "My Mother Likes Women" ("A Mi MadreLes Gusta Las Mujeres") is a lesbian romantic comedy classic that everyonewill adore.Sophia is a divorced Spanish woman with three adoring, grown-up daughters.And, as she announces during her quiet birthday celebration, she hasfallen in love. Immediately ecstatic for their mother, the three women arestopped dead in their tracks when they discover just who their mother'snew love is -- a beautiful Czech woman closer to their age than theirmother's. The daughters' reactions are brilliantly realistic and all overthe map. Suddenly everything they thought they knew about relationshipsand love is turned upside down, and everyone is sent into an uproariouslyfunny and tragic search for how to deal with love and desire.Tongue-in-cheek humor throughout, this movie is absolutely a joy to watch.If you know Spanish, it's an added bonus, but the English subtitles aresuperb and easy to read. The characters are genuine, the European sceneryextravagant, and the plot extremely clever. "My Mother Likes Women" islaced with humor, romance, and ultimately, a coming out story foreveryone. Cute, sassy, sexy, and witty. Great movie.

$review_text.: My immediate notion was not that &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; needed to be cut, especially because I can see where some characters and situations needed to be fleshed out a bit more, but rather than the pacing needed to be picked up a bit.  But director Anthony Minghella has deliberately slowed the pace of this film, to reflect both the measured progress that Inman (Jude Law) is making trying to get back to Cold Mountain, and the long period of time that Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) has been waiting for him to return.  Before I go farther, I should point out that &quot;The English Patient&quot; has the distinction of being the Oscar winning film from my lifetime that has most left me cold, so I am beginning to think that Minghella and I are just on totally different wavelengths.I really got the sense that Charles Frazier's novel was lurking behind this film, because there had to be more to the power of love than binds Inman and Ada together, despite the fact that their relationship before the start of the Civil War consisted of an exchange of tintypes and less than a minute of last minute kissing.  I fully understand why the picture and the idea of Ada would sustain Inman during the trauma of being a Confederate soldier for four years, but Ada's steadfastness is rather puzzling, based on smoldering looks and very few words from the man she has decided is to be her mate.  She does declare at one point that she will not leave because her &quot;last thread of courage is to wait&quot; for Inman's return, but the film does not provide much substance to give weight to those words beyond the fact she stays and waits.  I would think the novel provides more, but perhaps I am wrong on that score.The Battle of the Crater sequence that opens the film is fairly impressive; it was filmed in Romania which explains why so few of the Union soldiers were blacks (the battle was notorious because the Yankees made the error of running down into the crater, without ladders, instead of running around the giant hole in the Confederate defenses, and the Rebels refused to let the black troops surrender, slaughtering them instead).  In addition to the giant melee of battle there are also quick telling details, such as a soldier having his clothes blown off of him by the explosion.  The chief asset of the film is a superb supporting cast that includes Kathy Baker, Donald Sutherland, Brenand Gleeson, James Gammon, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Natalie Portman.  To give you an idea of how deep this cast goes, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is a film that has Jena Malone in a bit part.Several things distracted me from enjoying this film more.  The first was that I really did not have a good visual sense of Cold Mountain, so that every time Inman gazes at mountains I have no clue if he is getting any closer to home.  Compare this with another film sure to be nominated for Best Picture where you know Frodo and Sam are heading for the mountain with the smoke and fire coming out of it.  The second was that the villain of the piece, Teague (Ray Winstone), who once owned all of the land on Cold Mountain but is now running the Home Guard as his own gang of thugs, perplexed me.  On the one hand he seems overly concerned with hunting down deserters, which I say knowing that this is a way of his confiscating property.  But on the other hand he wants Ada and she spends years on a farm by herself and with one other woman for company, and it never occurs to him to just go and take her and be done with it.  Finally, there was a scene in the middle of the film where the Home Guard goes after some deserters and I found myself thinking that men who had served four years in the Army of Northern Virginia should be able to take these local clowns.  The film vindicated my belief, but it took a while to prove the point.Ren&eacute;e Zellweger as Ruby Thewes, the country gal who shows up to help the delicate Ada save the farm is a sure bet for an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actress and would have to be considered the frontrunner.  Her performance runs counter to the measured pace of the film overall and her poetic description of the war's insanity much be a reach for her character, but is still memorable.  Law has little dialogue in his scenes, but turns in the best performance of his career working mainly with his eyes.  The competition for Best Actor will be fierce this year, but he might be able to wrangle a nomination.  The same can be said for Kidman, especially if Mirimax decides to put its weight behind this film.  &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is one of those movies where your expectations are so high that falling short might it seem a lesser film than it really happens to be.  If this is an Oscar winning film, it is one that does it more by the numbers than by the force of the cinematic narrative that has been created.

$review_text.: This is one of those Steve Martin films that should always be available for purchase.  It is my favorite of his, along with All of Me.A Simple Twist of Fate is the story of a man who finds out the baby his wife is  carrying is not his.  She leaves him to go to this other man.He spends  his time afterwards buying expensive gold coins and polishing them and  staring at them every day until one day a man steals all his coins and runs  off with them.Steve Martin's character is real down about this time and  he just mopes around all day and doesn't talk to anybody.  Then, one day, a  simple twist of fate walks right into his life.  A little girl around a  year a half to two years old walks right into his house and chooses him as  a daddy.Her mama was a drug addict and she got her money for drugs from  a rich politician in town who was married, but who was the father of her  little girl.  The mama wanted more money and the man wouldn't give it to  her, so she packed the little girl and herself into the car and drove in  the snow to go see the politician.  But on the way, the car wouldn't work  any more and the woman and little girl walked in the snow.  The mother was  all high on dope and she died not far from Steve Martin's house, and the  little girl saw the light in his window and walked right on in just like it  was her own house.Steve Martin adopted her and the little girl grew up  to love him like her own daddy. Her real daddy (Gabriel Byrne)was still a  politician in town but nobody knew it until the real daddy wanted to lay  claim to his daughter, who was now about 10 or 12 years old.  Now there  would be a court battle on who would gain or keep custody of little  Matilda.I believe everyone should see this movie, and since the  producers are not producing this movie any more, I'm sure you could rent a  copy at your nearest video rental store.In the meantime, won't you  producers PLEASE bring back this beautiful and tender movie so that I can  buy a copy of it?

$review_text.: I caught Le Femme Nikita when channel five picked it up at some point in the late 90's. I was entranced from the first episode. The story of a street girl, framed for murder and forced to train as an anti-terrorist agent was gripping to watch. Excellently acted with intelligent plots and multi-faceted characters, the series delved into a world where no-one was as they seemed.Nikita: Innocent victim, who despite doing what she has to in order to survive, manages to retain her humanity.Michael: Apparently cold hearted and manipulative yet he hides his true nature as he knows that playing the game affords him greater chances of survival.Walter: Aging weapons specialist with a fun sense of humour. Survives in the Section due to his value.Madeline: Cold, perceptive and tactical. Madeline is the psychologist and torturer of the section. She has skeletons in her past, but she buries it in work.Operations: Ambitious, Ruthless and cruel. Operations runs section efficiently, yet chafes at the eyes on his operation.Birkhoff: Barely out of his teens, Birkhoff is the intelligent computer whiz kid responsible for all of sections computers. How this sweet guy ended up in section is left blank, yet we get the feeling that he had been too curious on the outside.My only issue falls on the DVD distribution. I live in the UK and am unable to buy this series. Luckily I have a multi-region DVD player and am able to purchase from the states, but I really hope that they will eventually cotton on to the numerous fans in Britain and finally acknowledge them.

$REVIEW.: Cursed is just another werewolf movie with hip dialogue.  Which is to be expected considering the writer, Kevin Williamson, also wrote the Scream trilogy.  Unlike Scream, however, there is nothing at all clever about the plot of Cursed.Basically, it is about a young woman and her younger brother who got "infected" and became a werewolf.  The younger brother, who is in high school, not only must deal with school bullies, but also with his new abilities as a werewolf.  Meanwhile, there is another werewolf on the loose, causing havoc throughout the city.  It's now up to the brother and sister to find out the identity of this other werewolf and stop him.This is probably a good teenage date movie though.  I can see where it would appeal to the high school age group.

$review_text.: This is one of the best transfers of a hit Broadway musical to movie musical. Everyone is superb! From Michelle Leeto Robert Morse to Rudy Vallee to Ruth Kobart--all re-creating their Broadway Roles!  Robert Morse's brilliant performance alone is worth the price of the dvd. Maureen Arthur's sexpot defines the word and is hilarious. Okay you can gripe that a few numbers from the Broadway Musical were left out--but overall this is a major success.Concerns a window washer who reads a book "How to Succeed in Business" and within about a week, goes frommail room clerk to Chairman of the Board . And he get's the girl in the end.Fosse's  Broadway choreography was recreated by an assistant for the film.  Frank Loesser's Score is classic and singable.And it shows how using the original Broadway Cast  can make a film work incredibly  well. (Take note those people who cast Lucille Ball in Mame and Peter O Toole in Man of La Mancha to terrible outcomes)I don't think this film was a huge hit when it came out but it surely deserved to be.  I watch it over and over. I sing the songs.  It's a keeper.

$REVIEW.: Team U.S.A.: Alex Shelley, Jay Lethal, & Sonjay Dutt Vs. Team Japan: Minoru Tanaka, Black Tiger, & Hirooki Goto (World X Cup Preview Match) - This was a really good choice to open the show up as it got the crowd on their feet. These six performers went very fast paced delivering solid, back and forth action. Great match as it did its job. 3.5/5Christopher Daniels Vs. Senshi - This was a battle between the former Triple X teammates. Daniels & Senshi went out there and put on more of a ground based, technical match instead of a high flying, fast paced match they normally put on being in the X Division. This was a good match as the crowd became more into it as the match progressed. Daniels & Senshi fought hard and they delivered a really good match. 4/5Konnan w/L.A.X. Vs. "Bullet" Bob Armstrong w/The James Gang (Arm Wrestling Contest) - The winner of this contest would give their opposition 10 lashings from a leather belt. Quite honestly though, this was a waste between two of the best tag teams in TNA (at the time). It might be entertaining to some of you but to me this was an absolute waste. 1/5Petey Williams Vs. Chris Sabin Vs. Elix Skipper Vs. Chase Stevens Vs. Puma Vs. Shark Boy (Xscape Match) - First of all, the Xscape Match rules are that participants in the match are eliminated by pinfalls or submission until two are left where they must climb over the top of the cage to floor to win. This Xscape Match contains some good X Division action & also has a lot of good and entertaining moments in it such as Petey Williams & Scott D'AMore (Team Canada's manager at the time) pulling a quick one over on Elix Skipper & Simon Diamond, Chase Stevens pulling off a Shooting Star Press from the top of the cage but would fall face first onto the ring canvas, a wrestling exchange from Petey Williams & Chris Sabin, Shark Boy being the first eliminated by Petey Williams' Canadian Destroyer (as it is always a sight to see), & the ending as Scott D'Amore accidently costed Petey the match. Overall, this match was great for a X Division Xscape Match. 4/5X Division Champion Samoa Joe Vs. Sabu - The only problem with this match is that it was way too short for what these two are capable of in this kind of match environment. Though, Sabu had an injured forearm so maybe that was why the match was cut short. However, Sabu & Samoa Joe gave a good performance for the short time they were in the Six Sides Of Steel together. Samoa Joe's roll in the match was to prove that he was indeed the most dominate X Division Champion ever as he nearly walked over Sabu in this match. Though not a bad match surrounding the circumstances, it still could have been much better. 3.25/5Team 3D Vs. Team Canada (Anthem Match) - This match did not catch my attention whatsoever. The match was the total opposite of what I expected it to be & it did not deliver at all for me. Just disappointing in my eyes. 2.5/5NWA Heavyweight Champion Christian Cage Vs. Abyss - This World Title Match is really good. Christian & Abyss firstly starts the match outside of the cage and fights into the crowd for a little while until Christian & Abyss makes their way back to ringside & then the match begins. Christian's & Abyss' battle in the Six Sides Of Steel was a great one. Christian can always put on a good match with whoever he is in the ring with & that's no exception here. Christian's Frog Splash onto Abyss from the top of the cage is somthing to see. Tacks gets introduced into the match as well where it would only cost Abyss the match. Bottomline, this was a great battle for the NWA World Title. 4.5/5Sting's Warriors: Sting, A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, & Rhino Vs. Jarrett's Army: Jeff Jarrett, Scott Steiner, & America's Most Wanted (Lethal Lockdown Match) - Firstly, Lethal Lockdown rules are similiar to the old WCW War Games Match rules. two individuals from each team starts the match for a 5 minute time period and from there at ever 2 minutes, one teammate from each team alternates in entering the match and once all the individuals enters the match from both teams, a roof is lowered ontop of the cage with weapons suspending from the top and from there a team can only win by pinfall or submission. This match only continued Sting's mission to get rid of Jeff Jarrett from TNA. The crowd was in anticipation for the roof to be lowered from the start and when it was, it brought excitement to everyone. A.J. Styles was the one who stole the match with his dive from the cieling to James Storm through a table ontop of the roof. This was a great main event & a perfect way to end the show. 4.75/5Overall, Lockdown was a good TNA event with it only containing one dud. This event is recommended.

$REVIEW.: Having watched all 8 seasons of the original television show of &#34;24&#34; over several weeks, I had enough time to witness and appreciate the ongoing plot and character development. Writers and directors showed their talents and provided closure in season 8, considering all the actions and characters in the show over the years. Although some gaps, such as glimpses of what happens with Jack's daughter and granddaughter or the female president (whose name escapes me at the moment) occur in the last episodes, perhaps they were or will be addressed in later story lines. I just saw Kiefer Sutherland mention that he is filming again for &#34;24,&#34; so perhaps we'll find out about these story lines while witnessing new adventures. All in all, if you can get past some unnecessary violence and blood and guts (which I know is a draw for some viewers, but got a bit repetitive for me, getting in in the way of plot and character development), the series and season 8 were stellar and quite satisfying to watch.

$REVIEW.: Antoine Fuqua Keeps churning out solidly crafted movies that are well worth remembering. A film like Training Day represents his best work. Or Tears of the Sun, a movie I have seen 7 times and absolutely adore. His latest effort, Brooklyns Finest doesnt dissapoint at all. Here Fuqua does a bit of Sidney Lumet in the tradition of Prince of the City. While not as compelling as that film or as remarkable it does pay a pretty impressive homage to the genre of films that deal with police corruption. This film is filled with a lot of violence, but not a lot of action. Even when there is action it seems to be played less for thrills and more for realism. As a whole the film is strangely somber and slow, but never dull. Over all this story is pretty familiar territory which brought to mind a lot of other similar films. Numerous movies like Serpico, We own the night, and Narc came to mind, to name a few. Over all an impressive film that handles its subject matter believably. Never utterly predictable, but not what I would consider Antoine Fuquas finest work. Still a pretty great movie. A solidly crafted film about police corruption that features excellent performances from Hawke, Cheadle, and especially Wesley Snipes who was unusually brilliant as a drug lord. Definately above average film, just dont expect this to be oscar territory and you should be pleased with the results.

$review_text.: Director Christopher Nolan hit artistic and cinematic paydirt with his underappreciated, &quot;Memento&quot;.  This latest effort is different in style and story, but repeats all the same mysterious character flaws in a landscape that's as beautiful as it is foreboding.Pacino, Williams and Swank all deliver spectacular performances and Pacino is incredible as the &quot;respected&quot; high ranking detective who has terrible secrets only to accidentally get in deeper.  His consience keeps him 'awake' and his craggy face and tired eyesacks show it.  Williams is just as creepy and frighteningly clever in his role, never reminding you that he is also a comedian.  Swank plays the young, awe-struck cop with ease, who also faces a problem of conscience as she gets to know her mentor, Pacino.  This secrecy and disallusionment seems to be the motif Nolan sets into the characters.The scenery is spectacular, but also, as shown in several scenes, not to be trusted - just like the main characters.It's a tension filled, medium action film that will keep you mesmerized until the end.  It doesn't matter if the ending is slightly predictable, it's the ride that matters.DVD includes all the typical Director's commentary (very interesting), making of documentary, theater trailers, etc.  Best of all is a sequence into the life of an 'insomniac'.  It gives the story all that more credibility.

$review_text.: The Abyss is an entertaining underwater adventure with non-stop action.  Forty percent of the action footage was shot underwater. The actors actually had to become certified divers.In the film, an oil rig crew is  hired to conduct a search-and-rescue mission when a nuclear submarine sinks  to the ocean floor during a fierce hurricane.  Throw in a few alien  creatures and some mysterious forces, and you have one heck of an exciting  film.The acting is above good, as Ed Harris delivers a remarkable  performance as Bud, the leader of the civilan oil rig.  Mary Elizabeth  Mastrantonio plays his separated wife who designed the rig, and equals him  with her own superb acting.The movie is loaded with action, conflicts,  determination, and a love story in the overall background.  The special  effects involving the water creatures were outright phenominal.  This film  keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is an outright heart-stopping  thriller.

$REVIEW.: Dosha Yoga with Hemalaya focuses on three main exercise routines. You can choose from Kapha, Vata and Pitta. There is also a special segment about the Ayurvedic lifestyle that explores giving yourself a massage with oils before showering and explains your best times of the day for various activities. You can also go online to a site to figure out which routine you should follow. I find you can do all three at various times. Kapha seems to work best on its own, but Vata and Pitta are fun to do together.Kapha was the first one I tried later in the afternoon and it was stimulating and energizing. Torso twists help the body relax into authentic music. The names Camel, Aligator and Swan help to bring the poses to life. By the time the routine was ending, I was quite ready to lay on the floor in corpse pose for as long as possible.Vata was the next section I tried early in the morning after taking a nice warm bath. The warming and calming elements are enhanced if you do this first and maybe even use Ylang Ylang or put on an exotic perfume. The calming and centering aspects are immediately apparent. You roll like a ball, do an interesting frog movement (hanging over, squat and keep moving from the floor to the sky with your hips). Soon you are swaying like a weeping willow and then challenging your balance. Indian dance is incorporated with hand movements and special mudras. At times this feels a little like a Vinyasa with additional artistic appeal. Facial exercises are done while you are in Cobra.Pitta was my favorite section and seemed very soothing and cooling. Your mind may feel like it becomes clear and awakens for the day. I like doing this exercise session in the morning because it seems to wake me up for the day. Eagle is especially fun. You start off like you are going to do a balancing pose and then lean forward, one leg behind you and literally flap your arms like bird's wings. It is an especially beautiful feeling and if you can balance on one leg, there is a sense of freedom and control. This seemed to be the most balancing for me and it allowed me to tap into my own powers of creativity.I can also highly recommend the Yoga for Urban Living Series. They are all healing and nurturing and you may find some of the same poses from this DVD, but with less focus on Ayurveda and chanting. I think this will be especially enjoyed by intermediate practitioners of yoga who want to add fun and creativity to their sessions. What I like about the Urban Living Series is the wide-open room she works out in.In this DVD, the room seems more cluttered (three people working out) and I missed that spacious feeling. The paintings on the floor and other icons seemed to distract just slightly from the workout because the artwork is so beautiful you keep looking at the pictures instead of focusing on your workout. But if you can remain focused and ignore the distractions, there is so much to enjoy. This is very much about stepping into another culture and enjoying the moment.I'm a big fan of Hemalaya's workouts so I hope she continues to make more and also includes a longer relaxation section at the end of the routines (even if it is just music). You have to get your own music because right when you lay down in final relaxation, the section ends. But don't let that stop you from enjoying the routines. You just have to plan ahead and have your own CD player nearby.~The Rebecca Review

$review_text.: My mother kept an old clipping for years describing SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS when it opened at the huge and prestigious Radio City Music Hall in New York City and received a rave review from newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler.He usually wrote about politics but on this occasion he took time to devote an entire review to Disney's new film. He called it a "masterpiece" and said that when the projectionist slipped those reels of film on the projector, the audience at the Music Hall witnessed one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.Coming from him, that was high praise indeed. And seeing the film now, restored for its video bow, we can appreciate his words. There are faults, to be sure, but basically it has to be admired for the innovative techniques it used in the art of animation. There are memorable sequences thanks to daring use of the multiplane camera: Snow White's flight through the woods, the Queen and her Magic Mirror, the Queen in the thunderous transformation scene as the camera seems to whirl around her, the Dwarfs in the mine and their march over the bridge as they sing "Heigh-Ho", the dwarfs chasing the witch in the thunderstorm. Even the rippling effects of the water in the wishing well scene.And, of course, there are the genuinely comic moments that made even the great Charlie Chaplin applaud in admiration. Dopey's antics are always a delight, as are Doc's and Grumpy's. All of the dwarfs are given inventive and funny things to do. The animation for the heroine herself is so gracefully done, particularly in the "Yodel Song" sequence where she dances with the dwarfs, that it's almost like watching a real "Snow White" go through the paces. That scene remains one of the most charming moments from the entire film with the dwarfs all displaying their own distinctive traits.The music is a standout: Someday My Prince Will Come, Heigh-Ho, I'm Wishing, The Yodel Song, etc. The young in heart will always love this classic. The art work is so rich in detail that the cottage scenes take on a life of their own, as do the images of the Wicked Queen at her castle.It belongs in the top tier of Disney's crown jewels, along with Pinocchio, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.Summing up: an inspired work of art on every level that will remain a timeless classic.Note: This review is based on the VHS and theatrical version of the film.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this after seeing 21 Jump Street in theaters.  I thought 21 Jump Street was so funny, I saw it twice in two days.  So, thinking I would stay on my Jonah high, I bought this.  It's not very funny at all; despite a pretty decent cast; and it failed on almost every level.  I only managed to chuckle two or three times, and the majority of the movie was really flat and lame.  Other reviewers have compared it to Adventures in Babysitting, and the plot is quite similar but they tried to drive it in a more adult-direction.  I had high hopes for this, I think Jonah Hill will eventually become one of our funniest and most celebrated actors ever and I've never seen Sam Rockwell in anything I didn't think was brilliant.  Rent it on PPV or netflix if you really want to see it, but save your money and buy 21 Jump Street when it comes out.

$REVIEW.: This is a stellar performance by a superb cast and conducted expertly by Valery Gergiev. Hvorostovsky and Fleming are ideal as Onegin and Tatiana The stark set, indeed a "non-set", is at first disappointing, but does succeed in focusing attention on the human drama instead of toward lavish production elements. Color is used very effectively to saturate each scene and outline the singers. This production no doubt benefited from the close scrutiny of the camera because the performances were finely tuned and sublty nuanced. As an example, the usual "dance spectacle" accompanying the Polonaise which opens Act III is replaced here by Onegin attended to by his valet staff while changing from dueling attire to formal dress. Although I enjoy a lavish production as much as anyone, it was refreshing to experience a concept which focuses primarily on the protagonists. This would not work with less than world-class principals.

$REVIEW.: I have to say, that even at my age, going back and watching these shows was really fun! It was nice to see that the themes and plots weren't all about combing hair and going to a beauty pagent. These stories had many excellent themes and for the most part they were very enjoyable.I found several elements, such as the bushwoolies, incredibly annoying and I think the series could have done without. However, for the most part, all the episodes were very entertaining and sometimes unpredictable.Rescue at moonlight Castle (?) and Escape from Catrina, the two bonus movies were the best by far, and I really liked the voice overs.THis series is really perfect for younger children, because it does deal with good vs evil in a very unfrightening way. THough I am a G2 fan myself, it was very fun and exciting to go back and watch the ponies come alive. I hope to show these to my own children (particularly the girls) someday!

$review_text.: This is our second copy of Walking with Dinosaurs

 Our two boys have watched it so much that we wore out our first copy!  Buy this DVD if you have even the remotest interest in dinosaurs
 I admit that I am a huge fan, and am impressed every time we view it


 Also look for other "prehistoric" productions by the BBC in this category--excellent quality CGI


 NOTE: These DVD's are often produced with celebrity narration which can be hit or miss (Brannaugh is excellent, Slater is mediocre.)

$REVIEW.: I remember seeing this film for the first time and it was a life changing event. At that point I was in a emotionally bruised place. Yet, this film inspired me so much to reinvent my life and make the long term comeback as I have. Sometimes we go to the movies and we have an epiphany of such proportions that it is a life changing event. Since I do collect films this Blu-ray disc incarnation is my 3rd purchase of this title all the way from VHS then to DVD and now in this truly magnificent form which makes this film such a joy to watch on my big screen TV and crank up the sound on my home theater system. Of course what people forget is the soundtrack by Tangerine Dream was magnificent then as it is now which I also bought on LP record, then cassette tape, and then on CD which I own 2 versions of because for some reason they did not put all the music on one disc. Needless to say I have all the music from the movie which is spectacular and helped to modernize soundtrack music today as we know it. Now, the Armani clothes Mr. Caan wore in this film provided by the then famous clothing store, &#34; CHARIVARI &#34; are so timeless especially in today's world where virtually any style goes. That 3/4 length leather coat and those suits are just superb. Then we get to the then early 80's Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz in black in it's just freshly downsized form that gave Mr. Caan's jewel thief character  of &#34;Frank&#34; the final touch as far as accoutrements go. The scene in the diner with Tuesday Weld is priceless simply because I can totally relate after having my own scene like that in a diner one time. Yet, it's a great piece of acting with these Mr. Caan & Ms. Weld on top of their game way back when. Robert Prosky as the heavy was a nice surprise when I saw this film the first time. He had gotten into the acting game late as an older man, but as a bad guy he shines. The other scene I love is where Frank goes to get his money from the plating company with his completely fearless character. Let's not forget Willie Nelson either who plays &#34;Okla&#34; who is Frank's mentor and father figure who in character reminds Frank that there are still good people to love like surrogate parents no matter how bad things get. I also bought the original book called &#34;The Home Invaders&#34; by Frank Hohimer who this film is based upon. This was another piece of the puzzle that helped me to really dig deep into the characters here in this film. Though the film's character of Frank doesn't say so, in the book Frank Hohimer reminds readers to NEVER team up with the MOB as they will start a relationship one way and then want to own you. Needless to say there are many great lessons about life to be learned from this film and whenever I need a little inspiration I put on this film and let it teach me some fresh lessons that I didn't see before. This is a great film to watch on a rainy night all cozy underneath some blankets with someone who you love~!

$review_text.: I honestly can't believe that this is the movie that comes between The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only

 Not that it's a terrible movie, but is a fine example of a 70's B movie.Actually, it wouldn't have been that bad of a movie, except for the extremely strange portrayal of one of my favorite bad guys, Jaws

 He meets a Heidi-esque girl and falls in love, and they too, end up in space

 In the end, he even assists Bond and Dr

Goodhead (a very forgettable Bond girl) in their escape of the doomed space station.I love Bond movies, and I am not one of those who goes into watching a Bond movie looking for depth and meaning
 Actually, my favorite Bond movie, Live and Let Die, has quite a few cheesy elements

 This is not a tossaway movie, but if you're new to classic Bond, don't let this be part of your first experience.

$review_text.: Beautiful Boy is the story of two parents, on the verge of separating, whose guilt and suffering bring them together during the aftermath of a tragic event


 The question of why their son commits an atrocious act is not answered as this movie focuses on the struggle of the parents who are trying to deal with the emotional upheaval the event has caused


 The pacing of the story is well metered and emphasized by wonderful performances by both Michael Sheen and Maria Bello as the stricken parents trying to come to terms with both why their son did what he did and how they may have played a part

 The fact that this film shifts the focus on the parents gives a different perspective as together they may or may not be the ones to blame, but their emotional journeys are no less touching than if their son had simply been a victim


 About the only point of contention is the limited way in which the son, Sam, is shown so there's no real conclusive ending or closure.A well executed film that rarely falls flat but is hard to watch at times

 Not exactly high on overall entertainment value
 The movie is a bit of a downer and doesn't exactly end on an upbeat note so I don't feel it's worth repeated viewings, but it bears watching for variety's sake and the intricate manner in which the characters discover more about themselves.

His dance on the counter in that scene when John Goodman and Dan Akroyd (spelling?) makes the whole movie fantastic.  And Aretha Franklin's RESPECT!  WOW!  Another dynmite song to dance to!

$REVIEW.: Note: French with English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean and Thai subtitles.An attractive but troubled young Carmelite nun named Sarah (Elodie Bouchez) falls ill and the physicans responsible for her care are unable to correctly diagnosis the cause. Thinking it maybe psychological in nature Father and Doctor Joachim Ferrer (Gerard Depardieu) is summoned to investigate.Father Joachim finds himself irresitably drawn to the vulnerable Sarah and continues to delve ever deeper into her pain and delusions even after Church authorities demand that he cease treatment and leave her to the care of the convent.Determined to solve the mystery, he becomes more detective than doctor or priest and eventually discovers that Sarah's medical problems are somehow psychically linked to her twin sister Gaelle who was just recently released from prison.There is something evil afoot between the syblings and only Father Joachim is in a position to save the innocent. Will he be willing to risk his priestly vocation to uncover the truth?'The Pact of Silence' is an exciting murder mystery/romance that will command your attention to the very end. Gerard Depardeau is excellent, as is the very lovely Elodie Bouchez in the dual role of Sarah and Gaelle. One of my favorite French films!

$review_text.: It's a shame that junk like "Tomcats" gets a wide release while gems like this, "Ghost World," never make it to the big movie theaters. Terry Zwigoff  directs this film, an adaptation of the comic book by Daniel Clowes. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson star as two recent high school graduates who, the summer after their senior year, begin to grow up and grow apart. Birch strikes up an odd relationship with a reclusive music lover played by Steve Buscemi ("Fargo"), which only serves to further the wedge between the girls. It's difficult to say what this movie is about, except to say that it's one of the most original coming-of-age stories done in years, something that will very much be worth looking for on video.

$REVIEW.: The title "True Detective" doesn't ring, ahem, true, now that I've finished the whole season.  It's ironic that the word "True" is in the title of something this far-fetched.  I was expecting a deep character study, and we do get that, but the problem is that the characters are too clich&eacute;...two burned out detectives who are damaged goods (one of whom is constantly spouting ridiculous philosophies that eventually become kind of a joke and detract from the show's seriousness).  And a villain I won't describe, to avoid spoilers, except to say that in the last episode, over-the-top suspense movies like "Seven" come to mind.  As the plot unfolds and becomes more and more absurd, it loses a little of the magic of its first few episodes.Does all of this mean that I didn't like it?  Nope.  It's massively entertaining.  The last episode was disappointing, only because it's so incredibly unbelievable, but as a thriller, the storytelling is solid and it never failed to keep my attention.  It just wasn't what I expected.  I had hoped for a little more TRUTH from the true detectives, some gritty realism rather than falling back on Hollywood conventions of not-of-this-earth characters and excessive plot-twistery.  I think that if the show weren't propelled by the incredible performances of its two leading men, it wouldn't have been nearly as compelling, so McConaughey and Harrelson should be credited for elevating the series beyond its overindulgent writing.

$review_text.: I first saw this film many years ago, but the funny thing is that I love it only more as the decades go by.This is especially a good film for people to watch who have a lot of pain in their lives, because Cabiria shows us how she got that too, and how she always gets up, dusts herself off and gets back in the game -- nay, joins the parade.There are many things I love about this film. It tells us so much of the world and Cabiria shows us a glimpse of the Divine coming through the personae. (How fitting that even her name, Cabiria, is a form of a word representing ancient divine deities.)Falling in love with Cabiria helped me also to fall in love with me.I would also like to mention how grateful I am that this film is still in black and white. It is true art.I have called other films my favorite, but in the end -- as of 2008 -- this is THE favorite. (Other contenders are very different though very good, such as TRUE ROMANCE which was written but not directed by Quentin Tarantino.)

$review_text.: It is said that the executives at MGM took away this film from director John Huston, since the issue of anti-heroism in war was unpopular, particularly at the time of McCarthyism and the action in Korea. Based on Stephen Crane's novel set in the Civil War, this tale of a Union Army youth who's fear makes him flee from the battleline, actually gets a patriotic rejuvination when the youth overcomes his understandable state of being a &quot;mental outcast&quot; and rejoins his unit. Some may see his subsequent bravery as overcompensation, since one wonders just how important it is to have the flag ahead of the troops in an advance. The youth's genuine sensitivity is juxtaposed with the phony crowing of the other soldiers, some naive, most expressed to conceal their own fear. It's remarkable that as the youth, Audie Murphy conveys an emotionalism that is lacking in his later Western career. One senses that the music by Bronislau Kaper is studio imposed, but the narration with excerpts from the book may well be Huston's contribution, considering he did the same thing with The Bible. Whoever decided on the readings, they are a mistake since Crane's writing is embarassingly awful. Huston stages the battle scenes with a formal elegance that also captures the general stupidity of the activity. He reduces the Rebels into howling Indians from a stock Western, but the enveloping smoke and the images of sunlight coming through treetops at dusk are strikingly beautiful.

I just wanted to inject some sanity amidst all the 5 star reviews here


I saw this in the theater with my friend's wife,and one of her friends,and we walked out just stupefied
I generally like Kline,along with many of the other actors here,but they are simply given nothing to work with
The plot is nonsensical (even though supposedly 'based on a true story'....as Pauline Kael might note,when you see those words,you know you're in for it),and the script would be mediocre even for a high school play

I have little doubt that all the stars in the picture would rank this travesty amongst the nadir of their career

$review_text.: Despite my title for this review, I basically enjoyed the movie.  The cinematography is excellent; the acting competent and the special effects...well...they look like special effects.On the other hand, the movie was a combination of predictable and unbelievable.  A child and an English lady...almost miraculously...turn out to be great drovers and, working alongside the leading man, bring 1,500 head of cattle to market despite pursuit by baddies who stampede the herd and even poison water wells.  The film is also totally Hollywood and politically-correct.  Australia, it seems, is eaten up by racism...except, that is, for our leading man and leading lady.  The racism theme is used time and again in the movie.  Our hero, heroine and the aborigenes are noble.  Predictably, almost everyone else, isn't.In case anyone misses the point, the heroine's [Kidman's] husband or father [I missed the first few minutes] has been murdered by an aborigene spear...but, as we learn to our politically-correct relief, the weapon was really a decoration wielded by a white bad guy. Hollywood.  When will the producers and directors grow up?

$REVIEW.: I didn't have the highest of hopes that this would be a good film, but when I had the chance to see it a couple of days ago I thought "why not?".I was actually pleasantly surprised by "Smokin' Aces", it wasen't complete bollocks as I'd expected. The direction of the film was good, production values were good, visually very attractive, decent soundtrack, good acting (from some members of the cast) and some very funny bits here and there.It was not all just fun and whoopie though. Some of the characters were too stereotypical and others were too far fetched. Some of the scenes and the gags were also too non-original in my opinion. Also the main character is in my opinion very badly acted by Ryan Reynolds. This is partly because his dialogue is somewhat boring and simple, but he definitely fails to convey the emotions and feelings of his character to the audience. Also the casting of Andy Garcia was overkill for that part.The story tries to be clever but fails. Although it's not really obvious what's going to happen next, it falls way short of being anything solid. This is a movie you should see for the visuals, not the story.

$REVIEW.: I watched all 12 episodes of this series. Let me just start off by saying that this series is not worth fifty freaking dollars. I also need to point out that I know all the previous Blood Vampire stories ( the anime movie, Blood+, and the live action movie) so I didn't go into this one blind. That being said, even going into to this series blind would not change the fact that this series is a mess in terms of story. It is bland, boring, and predictable to the point that it's insulting to the viewer's intelligence. What really makes me hate this anime is the way it ended though. While the ending was predictable enough, the tone of it made me have flashbacks to another awful anime's ending called 'Master of Martial Hearts'. I love the Blood+ series, and I love a lot of CLAMP's stories, but CLAMP drastically failed when it came down to this series. I finished this series feeling sick to my stomach, depressed, and angry. I really don't recommend this anime to anyone. If you have a Blood Vampire fix that needs curing then go watch Blood+. It's a superior series with a satisfying conclusion.

$REVIEW.: This is an odd film, but definitely one of the better ones of his late 60s efforts.  The pace is slow, there are no big stars, it is embedded in a historical drama related to real events, i.e. the Cuban missile crisis. There is also an array of excellent French actors, who speak only in heavily accented English.  Nonetheless, it is a very good film, if not a great one.The main character is a French intelligence operative, who operates in close cooperation with the CIA and is a kind of maverick.  He is extremely good at what he does and has a system of his own operatives and collaborators set up.  As he gets involved in an investigation at the behest of the CIA, he comes into contact with crude Cuban revolutionaries (one of them finds a diplomatic dispatch wrapped around a half-eaten hamburger), uses an affair to get information about Russian missile placements in Cuba, and then fights to find a conspiracy (and at the same time save his career) in Paris.  He operates in environments that mix elegant style with the saddest brutalities and constant threats, often humorously portrayed.As always, the details and imagery are quirky, unusual, and unexpected.  While the plot is a bit pedestrian, the intrigue and off-hand humor are wonderful.Recommended.  Not Hitch's best, but the best of his late efforts.

$REVIEW.: This workout combines sport moves (bootcamp) and dance moves (boogie) in a surpisingly great way.  It is cued beautifully, and the movements really work well together to give you a great, total body workout.  I usually am not very good at following a lot of dance moves, but I had no trouble following this workout the first time I did it.  The dance is pretty simple, yet very fun, and it is a nice release from the bootcamp moves.  Petra Kolber cues perfectly, and she is motivating and fun.  The workout is about 55 minutes of cardio, including the warmup.  The movements include lunges, punches, repeater knees, plies, chasses, pivots, marches, jumps, hip sways and more; I worked out different muscles than I do with a lot of my other DVDs.  The cardio is broken into intervals, including a 45-second intense burst at the end of the intervals.  However, I almost didn't notice I was doing the burst because Petra eases into it beautifully and it goes fast.  There is also a recovery section after these intervals, which includes plies and hip sways and which slows your breath again.  Petra teaches everything add-on style, and she and her background exercisers do three different levels of intensity so you can pick the one that is right for you.  She works both sides of the body evenly, although you have to wait a little bit to do the second side.  All in all, the program is unique, fun, and effective.  I exercise regularly and I was fatigued by the end - in a really good way.  This workout would be good for anyone who is already familiar with exercise.  I believe this is a great workout at a late intermediate or early advanced level, and I enjoyed that it can be modified for more or less intensity.  I really enjoyed working out to this DVD, and I recommend it.

I happen to love Period Flix and this one does not dissapoint in my opinion, I was never once interested in moving from my chair once the movie began..

BEWARE this is also one of those that if you get up and come back a moment later you may miss something essential to the story

If you see my other reviews you'll see that I devour romance novels, well this movie was like watching one of those come to life.Jeremy Northam and the Jennifer Ehle are remarkable in their potrayal of the 2 Poets, their words were moving and whomever selected them for these roles did a outstanding job.


during the movie their voices are heard reading passages from their letters to one another.
Jennifer and Jeremy's voices sound so sincere and passionate it wraps you in to this story from GO.Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart were believable as the 2 present day people trying to piece together a mystery from the past

I loved this movie because the 2 stories were interwined so smoothly, their were no loose ends left untied and everything made sense in the end

I haven't read the book that this movie was made from but since seeing it I have been on the Auction sites looking for the original book.If you like your movies with a &quot;twist&quot; at the end I would also recommend {The Red Violin} it is another period flick with a incredible story that keeps you seated throughout.Respectfully Reviewed

$REVIEW.: This third series of Dexter follows the same pattern as previous series. Whilst working in the Miami homicide department Dexter kills deserving criminals who got away with their crimes. Each episode usually has it's own story where Dexter hunts and kills his target and then there is the over-arcing series story, this time the hunt for `The Skinner', that is interwoven.In this series Dexter and Rita's relationship takes another step and Dexter also finds a new friend, but there may be more to him than meets the eye.Thankfully this is still written very well and had me second guessing and teetering on the edge of my seat the whole way through. I found the ending had slightly less impact than the previous series' did, but it was still adequate payoff for the time spent watching the DVD. Michael C Hall is as amazing as ever as Dexter and whilst the actress who plays his sister is still pretty wooden and gets annoying due to playing a loud mouthed arrogant character, at least her performance here is better than in series 1 or 2. That's the thing I've found with Dexter overall actually, the story is excellent and keeps you gripped and Michael C Hall is excellent, but the rest of the cast give changeable performances and sometimes are very believable and other times they make you cringe. If you feel the same way as me about series 1 and 2, you will see that nothing much has changed here.All in all, this is another superb Dexter series and it develops his character, the back story to his life, his relationships and the overall theme very well indeed. You shouldn't be disappointed.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

$REVIEW.: Watching COSMOS was one of the most influential experiences of my early teens. It sent me off on dozens of areas of interest and research that continue to this day, and I've always had a fondness for Carl Sagan for giving me that gift. Unfortunately, I gradually forgot what the show itself was like, without ever forgetting how influential it had been. I had even forgotten about the lovely music. So I have wanted to purchase the COSMOS DVD set for quite some time.To be honest, I was concerned that the 25 year old special effects might weaken its appeal while viewing it again as an adult. But now that I've seen it again I realize that it was never the graphics (state-of-the-art as they were at the time) that inspired me so much. In a way, it wasn't even the content, since you could find most of the content elsewhere. It was simply watching Carl Sagan's natural sense of wonder, curiosity and awe, which is something we just don't see in people anymore. Sagan was utterly fascinated by the Cosmos, and COSMOS seems at times more like a love letter more than a science documentary. It's contagious. Watching COSMOS, I felt exactly the same way I did when I was a kid--like there was a whole universe out there just waiting to be discovered and explored--by me!What a shame that the bureacracy and stupidity of politicians, lawyers, and businessmen who can't even conceive of what "wonder and awe" means (they prefer "shock and awe"), have forced us all to waste our precious lives pushing papers and sitting inside concrete tomb offices all day, every day. I like Sagan's world better.Get this box set--the high price is worth it many times over--and if you do not feel inspired and passionate about the world you live in afterwards, you're either dead, or you're a politician, lawyer or businessman.

$review_text.: I have really enjoyed working with Sera's new DVD. It so far has been great for for my bellydance practice.This DVD covers conditioning drills, refinement of technique, and interesting combinations....along with great tips on posture, body alignment, etc. Though, the basic arm positions for tribal are explained, just know this DVD doesn't go into depth about "step by step" break-downs of the basic bellydance foundation movements.The chapters are broken down into sections for each sequence of combinations. These combinations and drills are structured to enhance your dance by conditioning, strengthening, as well as, increasing your articulation.Chapters:Warm-Up & Opening MeditationArm StrengtheningUpper BodyHipworkWeight shift, footworkHip Undulations"Follow Along"(no cues) of entire dance (or all combinations)2 Performances by SeraThe whole instructional is taught with continuous non-stop movement (or a flow) with a "follow me" type feel.You will first, view a clip of the combo in it's entirety performed by the class, then Sera and just a few of her students, drill a few basic movements... then they add & layer to create the complete combination. Once you learn all the combinations, there is a chapter that puts all the combinations together, so you can practice a complete dance routine.I personally enjoyed the warm-up section. I don't always have the patience to take the time I should to warm-up, but Sera made it interesting and fun. And I also liked the combinations taught, really great examples of Sera's unique style of tribal fusion.Overall, a fun and fantastic DVD for your dance practice. You will get a nice workout with its steady pace and can incorporate the dance-worthy combinations into your tribal fusion repertoire. I would go as far to say, this program is quick enough for even the intermediate dancer to practice with--yet, I would not recommend to anyone who is not familiar with the bellydance basics.

$REVIEW.: For Father's Day, my son and I went to see the fifthin a series of Batman movies..."Batman Begins".  Atrue fan of this big screen sequence, I thought thisprequel was refreshing, exciting...and on a totallydifferent plain from the first four.  What Idiscovered was that Batman has a heart...has ahistory...has every reason on the planet to don wings,ears and abilities above and beyond the call ofDracula.While I was expecting the same action-packed thrillsfrom the "Batman", "Batman Returns", "Batman Forever",and "Batman and Robin" full screen classics, this onehit a completely different nerve.It is a two-hour and 20 minute drama...creating thelife of Bruce Wayne from childhood to the Joker.Starring Christian Bale as Bruce (Batman) Wayne, thisone was far from being the action thriller withnon-stop special effects, violence and thrills.Director Christopher Nolan took this opportunity togive Batman a heart...a purpose...a reason forbeing...and he does it masterfully.  To achieve thisgoal, he had no choice but to submit a 140-minutemasterpiece that achieves everything it set out to do.Don't bring the little ones.  This intellectualthriller is 20% action...80% intellectual.Granted, the action builds in the last 30 minutes andthere's an awesome Batmobile chase, but the true meritof this film is the heart of Batman.  Bale turns in ahighly believable performance as the viewer discoverswhy Bruce became the comic book hero of the 50's.The music and sound holds this flick together.Wayne's heart throb Rachel (Katie Holmes), turns in anaverage performance, but this film would have bombedwithout Bale.Perhaps the finest performance is turned in by cinemalegend Michael Caine as Batman's butler.  He hasn'tmissed a beat.If this film had been released as the first in thesequence of five films, I would have given it a 5.But because us viewers expected more action based onits predecessors, I give it an 4...which isn't bad.Bale bails this one out.

$review_text.: Anne of a Thousand Days is by far the better of the two

The acting is much better and the subject matter much more accurate

Mary, Queen of Scots tends to make Mary seem a victim and much too nice to have come to such an end

Nothing could be further from the truth


She purported to be a faithful Catholic, but didn't hesitate to attempt to murder her second husband and commited adultery with her, later to be, third husband
She also attempted to organize the assasination of Queen Elizabeth I at least twice

These things are brought out in the film, but are glossed over as the follies of youth


Since the life expentency at the time was an average of 35 years, I wonder how old one need be to be called a youth


Still , the actual history of her life is mostly accurate

I purchased these to replace the VHS copy of Anne of a Thousand Days and the other one came with it as a set


I have watched the first many times and still enjoy it and recommend it to those interested in the Tudor history.

$review_text.: This DVD set of "Jewel in the Crown" is touted as being the "25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION." However, the transfer is old and fuzzy and the soundtrack is often muffled and unbalanced.By no means are the discs unwatchable, but they could DEFINITELY be of better quality. When I see something touted as a special edition I think remastering, bonus features, commentary, etc. There is none of that here.This is a bare-bones transfer, apparently from the original tapes. Nothing has been done to update or enhance the viewing experience of this EXCEPTIONAL production. And this production FULLY DESERVES to be spiffed up! The performances are enthralling, the plot is enticing, the scenery is sumptuous. Even though I had to agree with the comments of others who stated that the editing is choppy and the story is somewhat disjointed, I really enjoyed watching all 14 episodes over the course of several weeks. But I couldn't keep from shaking my head and thinking "what a shame" about the quality and how deceived I felt by the presentation of a "Special Edition."

$REVIEW.: What's wrong with a straight-up shark thriller? Deep Blue Sea showed us that character development and sparkling dialogue aren't necessary when you approach shark movies with craftsmanship and little pretention.RED WATER is here to remind us how hideously wrong it can all go. Should we start with the acting? Let's. Lou Diamond Phillips is not a bad actor. I loved his over-the-top performance in THE BIG HIT, but he plays it straight here, bogging down in unspeakable dialogue and trying to make the melodrama appear genuine. I haven't seen  Kristy Swanson since the Buffy Movie. Her appearance is significant because I thought she was dead.. :/Coolio doesn't need much talent: he character ought to be natural to him. The bad guy is okay, typically scruffy and unshaven.All of these actors certainly  could have done better had they had better dialogue to spew. How many times have we seen the scene where the ex-husband and ex-wife begin to be reuinted in the face of danger? How about where the hero mournfully recounts his troubled past?But let's talk about what REALLY matters. The animatronic shark looks great, but it is intercut with some shoddy CGI work, and it frequently changes size and shape. There are several attacks at the beginning, all of them predictable (a bad sign, DEEP BLUE SEA's best attacks were viscous and surprising) and bloody, but not done in a visceral fashion. There's no new camerawork or methods of making an old creature attack more hard-hitting. When people are killed, I felt very little.Several opportunities to create genuine suspense (the flashing on the underwater lights to alert the divers of the sharks presence) are squandered so often that their mere possibilites must have been accidents.The movie also bogs down in a ridiculous treasure-hunting plot. I realize this is necessary to keep the characters in "the crucible" (i.e., keeping them always in conflict) but why must if be so pretentious? Why must there be "human" conflict with the drug dealers? Why must there be explosions? Unless you're DEEP BLUE SEA, less is more.And by the way, the phrase "The Jaws of Death" will ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS be lame and hackneyed, no matter what language it's in. (You'd think if they were going to pull it off in French, they wouldn't have translated it for us)Speaking of cliches, see if you can count the ones in this movie. My favorites were the aforementioned "troubled-past-reminicing" and the hero's final insult to the beast during the climax.Had this not been a made for TV movie, perhaps a more creative director could have done something visceral and carnage-ridden. The river-setting is rife will possibilites. It's made for TV premeir during shark week was exciting, but simply because I am one of those who is immediately attracted to any movie featuring a set of teeth, ESPECIALLY a sea creature,and ESPECIALLY a shark.I suppose I should be thankful. After slogging through the SHARK ATTACK serious and countless direct-to-video sea thrillers, RED WATER comes as a kind of blessing. Gone is the blatant FLATNESS. Instead of just being a second-rate-studio churned out, by-the-numbers piece of sheep intestine, the makers of RED WATER seemed to have genuine interest in the project.  Regardless of whether or not they failed, this pleases me.If you seek River/shark horror, the best I can recommend is watching JAWS and ANACONDA back-to-back. If that doens't suit you (no reason it shouldn't) or you are simply a crazed shark-movie maniac, then check out RED WATER.(By the way, the shark on the cover is obviously a great white, whereas the shark in this movie is a bull shi- AHEM... bull shark. Some shoddy marketing there, dontch'ya think?

$review_text.: I figured this film would be a complete vomit when I got it for free while buying Rob Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN.  The folks at DIMENSION must be pretty desperate to unload this nonsense if they have to give it away as a freebie.  Now I have to be bothered with getting this wretched, sensless, vile, waste of film out of my house because I would truly be embarrassed if anyone saw it in my home and thought that I was stupid enough to purchase it.This film represents EVERYTHING that is wrong with American Horror cinema today.  There is not a single interesting or original idea in the entire film.  How much did DIMENSION have to pay Earl Dietman of WIRELESS MAGAZINE for his cover quote "Unlike ANY horror film you've seen before or will ever see!  The scariest movie of the year!"  Of course the film is exactly the same old boring, PG-13, CGI, desaturated nonsense that the movie-by-committee system has been throwing at us for the last four or five years.  We've all seen everything in this incoherent, ugly film OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  When will film studios get the idea that CGI digital visual effects are tired, boring and simply no longer interesting?CGI is not a substitute for IDEAS or SCARES, and of course PULSE has neither one.There is also that matter of the hideously ugly look of this film.  Every single frame from start to finish is tinted a cold blue, which is of course supposed to make the film look serious, artistic and important.  Naturally, anyone who isn't brain dead will recognize immediately that this is just a cheap gimmick to make it seem like the viewer is watching SOMETHING when instead we are really watching NOTHING AT ALL.  No ideas, no scares, no humor, no art, no likeable characters.  NOTHING  That is what this film is.  It is an abundance of nothing.Lets talk about the cast.  Suffice it to say that everyone sleepwalks through the entire film.  The entire cast as if they are on their way to a fashion magazine photo shoot, wearing clothes that would be impossible for the average American to afford.  Kristen Bell even takes a bath wearing full eye makeup (which is applied so heavily that she looks as if she has just time-warped out of a scene with Liz Taylor in CLEOPATRA).  There is nothing that could be remotely called acting going on anywhere in this botched incomprehesible mess.Sadly, it has become a safe bet that if a horror film is released in the United States by any major studio, or if the name Weinstein is associated with the film, then you will be watching an idiotic, CGI filled train wreck.  Now of course there are the occasional exceptions to that rule (DISTURBIA, CABIN FEVER, GRINDHOUSE) but in general, studio film making has sold out so bad I don't believe they even know what a real horror film looks like any more.  Too bad the folks at DIMENSION don't take a look at films being released by true independents like ASYLUM, RAPID HEART, ECHO BRIDGE etc.PULSE is certainly the worst film I've seen since SOUL SURVIVOR and in fact, it may be the worst film I've ever seen . . . EVER.  It is such an insulting, insipid, uninspired, artless heap of garbage.  A cinematic bowel movement.  Every single blue tinted, washed-out frame of it is an assault on what good film making should be.  It is really past time to simply boycott this stuff.  The fact that I got this film for free somehow makes it all even worse.  It is as if DIMENSION was saying, "You simply have to watch this garbage, and we know that no individual with even the slightest big of discernment would ever pick up this stinking pile of dung, so we will give it you free of charge because we think you deserve it."I can't believe I ranted this long over such a rotten film.  Shame on everyone involved in making this rotten, wretched, hideously ugly film.That includes you Wes!

$REVIEW.: "The Jazz Singer," available for the first time on Blu-ray, is often mistakenly referred to as the first movie with sound.  It is the first feature film with completely synchronized dialogue and musical sequences, but much of it is essentially a silent movie.  It stars the biggest pop celebrity of the era -- Al Jolson -- in a tale with considerable similarities to his own life story.  Jolson portrays a would-be entertainer whose show business aspirations conflict with the values of his cantor father (Warner Oland).  Based on a 1925 play, "The Jazz Singer" premiered in New York City in October, 1927, in the Vitaphone process, in which a 16-inch disc was synchronized with standard 35-millimeter projection equipment (the industry would eventually change to the sound-on-film process, where a magnetic soundtrack was imprinted on the film alongside the picture)."The Jazz Singer" was a huge success in the approximately 200 theaters with sound equipment, and within two years, nearly 8,000 theaters were wired for sound. The film features a number of Jolson's trademark songs:  "Toot-Toot-Tootsie Goodbye," "Dirty Hands, Dirty Face," "My Mammy," and a then-new song composed by Irving Berlin, "Blue Skies."The three-disc Blu-ray edition contains a full-length documentary feature, "The Dawn of Sound: How Movies Learned to Talk;" four hours of Vitaphone shorts featuring George Burns and Gracie Allen, Baby Rose Marie, Blossom Seeley, Elsie Janis, and several other vaudeville performers; vintage cartoons; a 1947 "Lux Radio Theater" broadcast starring Al Jolson; and an 88-page book containing behind-the-scenes collector's cards, lobby cards, souvenir program, vintage documents, and a post-premiere telegram from Al Jolson.

$REVIEW.: This takes off where "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"- the movie left off. With Big Chris riffing "its been emotional" into a full length gangster psychodrama. This was a roller coast ride of a film. At first I was tempted to eject it out of the DVD player. Get a bit bored with working class crim macho. But, this is the problem, I'd probably watch Ray Winstone doing a tampon add. So, I hung in there and was glad that I pulled me knackers up and got on with the business of man watching. Winstone as Colin Diamond was brilliant. Think Lear without the daughters but unravelling into madness. Ian McShane as the gay hard man was downright scary, a blend of camp psychopath. Tom Wilkinson, the anchor. Everyman on the journey up the river of darkness, no paddle, no life-raft and a captain as mad as a snake on bennies about to be flattened by that huge shovel of trying to get his few unadulterated brain cells around understanding women, libido, possession and that being the biggest alpha male is not going to get you over the line all the time. The story is never predictable, just as you thought you knew where it was going it would smash through another layer. Like "Sexy Beast" the script was a pleasure to hear. Emotional? Bloody hell, I'm a mess after viewing this one.

$review_text.: So I see this movie at Blockbuster. It's got a pretty ridiculous 3-D prismatic cover that features a herd of demonic sheep and it's called "Corn". I couldn't resist...The tagline on the video box, "It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature" is borrowed from an old margarine commercial. This thing has got to be awful, right? Well, the reality is that it's not quite as bad as you might imagine. It ends up being a weird Rosemary's Baby kind of story about genetic manipulation and aggression. Not done with the same panache of 28 Days Later, it still strives for a unique story. In the end, "When Sheep Attack" might have been a better title, and it's pretty boring at times... but I think two stars is fair.

$review_text.: No debate about this being the best filmed version of this story, but hoping this is not some cheap fly by night dud of a copy.Guess will just have to wait and see if the company mastering this program has what it takes to give it the treatment it deserves.  I cant understand why Paramount can release all kinds of trash on dvd not worth watching but cant remaster and produce a decent copy of this program along with extras related to the story and bios on the actors, especially the gifted Elizabeth Montgomery?  This did win several awards that year, besides its still far and away the one that captures how creepy and unhappy this family must have been...

$REVIEW.: This episode begins with what appears to be a low budget version of Balance of Terror
We don't even get to see the Gorn ship, which takes some excitement out of a high-speed chase, which Kirk believes is important to the Federation.As soon as the Metrons step in, however, the action picks up considerably

Kirk is forced to battle the leader of the Gorns, and the resulting combat is fun, exciting, and suspenseful.The Gorn is well-done and effective, slow, but too strong for Kirk to overcome using his standard Federation Judo that usually serves him quite well.The final showdown between Kirk and the Gorn is a classic Star Trek scene that is not to be missed.

$REVIEW.: So what's your Clockwork Orange? Weather your a film buff who's seen pratically every movie known to man or you don't really watch movies all that much, everyone has that one film that they can keep going back to. That one film that no matter what they will never EVER get sick of it. For me it's Stanley Kubrick's 1971 masterpiece "A Clockwork Orange." This was the film that made me a film buff. This was the film that made me sit up and say "What the [heck] did I just see?" I absolutly love this movie. It's disturbing in parts, it's funny in parts, it's bizzaar in parts (all parts). This is a true cult classic and one that will always be around for years to come. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: As a social barometer of the times it may be reading a bit too much into "A Summer Place" to proclaim it as an early ripple in the social tempests still to come in the 1960's.  Still those of us alive at that time know that in 1959 it WAS controversial to sympathetically portray adultery and teen sexuality as depicted in "A Summer Place".  I remember my high school years (early '70's) and how girls who "got into trouble" would simply disappear and you'd never know what became of them until a classmate told you years later of their waywardness (this was still a VERY rare occurrence here in "flyover country" even then; how things have changed). And of course while adultery and divorce were likewise not quite so prevalent "back in the day," they certainly happened but not without considerable burden of stigma for the convention-defying lovers who tossed everything over for their passion.So yeah, I do think the sociology of "A Summer Place" is significant but that's really the least reason to see it.  Mostly it's just maximum guilty-pleasure FUN and a HUGE blast of '50's nostalgia and "attitude" that still has great charm and luster for receptive movie fans.Rule number 1 is that you must have full tolerance for what we could now call cheesy acting and intensely overripe melodrama.  AND ALSO you must be prepared for the intense full-frontal gumball-vivid Technicolor cinematography of the time.  Too many viewers can't see beyond the stylistic conventions of the time a movie was made to appreciate the human story being told; what a pity!  Think of everyone you know who just won't watch a movie because it's in black & white, or because it's obviously an old, overcooked Hollywood potboiler.  You know what?  Many of those are GREAT works of art however (like most art) they require that you make the effort to meet them halfway.  Think of them not only as theatrical productions but also as time capsules of the era they were created--because that's exactly what they are.  And how fortunate we are now to have such easy access on DVD for our enjoyment now!But enough of the film theory stuff.  "A Summer Place" appeals on many levels; the gorgeous cinematography, the convention-challenging story & script, the VERY effective and well-remembered orchestral score, and let's not overlook the cast.  Sandra Dee & Troy Donahue do indeed project a kind of youthful innocence that truly is a thing of the past now, but was common in their time.  Dorothy McGuire & Richard Egan give it their all as the reunited Pine Island lovers who cannot resign themselves to half-lives of marital indifference or cruelty.  And how about those jilted spouses?  You gotta love Constance Ford as the scheming, triple-bitter wife interested only in keeping her husband & daughter under her thumb.  Look-the DVD transfer shows how she has make-up "frown lines" painted at the corners of her mouth just in case we don't get the point that she's a sullen, PO'd bitter woman.  A Snidely Whiplash mustache wouldn't have been gender-appropriate, would it?!?  Arthur Kennedy also gives a GREAT performance as Dorothy's bibulous husband who despite his degraded state still musters considerable self-awareness & ultimately inspires our sympathy.I described "A Summer Place" earlier as a guilty pleasure, but now I want to back off a little bit in closing.  This is not really drama that will shake you fiercely like, say "21 Grams" or "Dead Man Walking," however I confess I AM touched by the underlying sincerity of "A Summer Place" and its intent to provoke--gently--some questioning of the Eisenhower era values that seemed set in stone and indeed WERE a cage of oppression for many. Perhaps your appreciation of "A Summer Place" will be proportional to your level of receptivity to such a re-evaluation.  All I know for sure is that you enjoy it half as much as I do, you will like it a very great deal indeed!ADDENDUM 4/11/12: "Summer Place" remains a huge favorite, and I've gone on to enjoy Delmer Daves' other Troy Donahue movies (nicely bundled in theWarner Bros. Romance Classics Collection (Palm Springs Weekend / Parrish / Rome Adventure / Susan Slade)), but "Summer Place" is still INDISPUTABLY the best.  Blu ray would certainly be the next frontier for "SP", and I admit I'm hoping they take some time to add some meaningful extras--and a good modern COMMENTARY track would likewise greatly add some perspective and "back-story" to the experience.  (The DVD is sure way better than nothing--still highly recommended--but it has NO extras at all.)I still think "Summer Place" is an important pop culture expression of the changing social attitudes and mores of the late '50's-early '60's, reflecting how all generations were questioning what life "expected" of them versus the gravity of their own yearnings.  And as such it's definitely worthy of a little "deluxe edition" re-issue love!  Come on WB--Make me buy "Summer Place" again!

$review_text.: *** This review may contain spoilers ***Amazon reviewers are real sheep

Everybody is bashing 50 Cent but very little of these rants posing as reviews actually speak about the actual movie

Let's get one thing straight


If you hate 50 so much that you cant even write a partial review on this movie don't review it
Im not fond of 50 as a rapper and as a person but that is a lousy reason to give this movie bad reviews.Get Rich Or Die Trying is loosely based on the life of Curtis Jackson and based on that reason its pretty good


50 plays himself and there are good performances from Terrance Howard as well as Joy Bryant who plays Charlene, Marcus's girlfriend in the movie


Bill Duke is pretty good as Levar the boss of the organization Marcus links up with

Adewale Akinnouye Agbaje is excellent as the ruthless Majestic


The movie covers Marcus childhood as well is how he became to be a rapper

One might question the authenticity of the story being told in this movie(this being the movie's real flaw) but as far as entertainment goes I enjoyed myself.Its a shame when people allow the hapless trendies that run amok on Amazon, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes dictate to you what qualifies as quality movies

These weirdos think that defending awful movies that were rightfully panned like Freddy Got Fingered, Nothing But Trouble, Batman and Robin, The Musketeer and The Black Dahlia makes them hip and cool and not pathetic posers in dire need of a life
And as far as acting goes the last time I checked  Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Leonardo Dicaprio, Brad "Musty Arm" Pitt(overrated beyond belief), Casper Van Diem,  Chuck Norris were not real actors! To all of you reasonable people out there do not allow the circus freaks on Amazon, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes to tell you what counts for good cinema because you will be disappointed every time


There are a lot of great movies that never made the Top 250 or gotten Fresh Tomatoes
Just goes to show you the bandwagon mentality of these pseudo intellectual rodents

And as far as the overly sensitive sheep go, I wouldn't waste time trying to reason with your schizophrenic a**es
Go fawn over the ever-so-overrated Quentin Tarantino like the spineless groupies you are.BRING ON THE UNHELPFUL VOTES!!!!

$review_text.: `Paranoia Agent' defies most of conventional anime. No giant robots, big guns, or girls with blue hair. It takes place in present day Tokyo and revolves around the lives of everyday workers. It is also unique for being an anthology.`Paranoia Agent' is not based around the conflict of heroes and villains. It depends mostly on style. The opening credits are arguably the most memorable in anime history. We see our many characters standing in the midst of a disaster, flood, fire, earthquake, nuclear bombing. However they are all laughing uncontrollably in an insane manner, as to make us think that these characters may have come to except the horror of their lives.The plot: Unlike most anime series `Paranoia Agent' is an anthology, each episode seems to exist on its own, in that we are introduced to new characters whose stories begin and end with that episode, an anthology. The stories are all related in the sense that each of our characters lives in modern day Tokyo and is having trouble in life, generally work related. They all end up being attacked by boy in roller blades, Little Slugger.The stories are very entertaining in a dark comedy way, from a sleazy reporter who owes money to the mob, a school girl by day and prostitute by night, an anime production team that's behind schedule, friends that keep failing in their many attempts to commit suicide. Little Slugger attacks them all.As the show progresses, so does Little Slugger. It becomes quite obvious that he is super natural. It also becomes quite obvious that `Paranoia Agent' has absolutely no intention of wrapping things up or ever explaining the truth about Little Slugger or any of the bizarre events. And it doesn't.I couldn't see this series going on any longer and it's nice they ended it after 13 episodes allowing us to remember it fondly.`Paranoia Agent' works mostly because of its style. The animation and directing are great. It also works because of its very entertaining stories, as short as they might be.

And a Disney flik is never complete without the help from a Cutsie kid that no one cares about (unless your 9) especially in a Marvel film like this

$review_text.: You can immediately feel that you are a part of history and even when you know their (Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera) story you still get surprised amused and amazed. I have seen their actual work and this film brings it back. For people that do not know their story this is an excellent introduction. I found it interesting how Frida (Selma Hayek) and Diego (Alfred Molina) complimented each others personality so well from the beginning until where we leave them.Also the films surrealistic qualities will remind you of "Like Water for Chocolate".  Many times this enhances instead of distracting form the reality of the films port ate.  The colors being vibrant and even the music being vibrant fives a three dimensional quality to the film. I have only seen one other Julie Taymor directed film "Oedipus Rex" (1992) which also had this quality. Julie seems to know how to bring out thoughts that we do not know we have our selves and we see many things in a new way.I started to buy the soundtrack but do not see Lila Downs on any of the tracks. And her singing was the soul of the movie.Now it is time to read the Hayden Herrera (book) "Frida - A Biography of Frida Kahlo" to see how much is in this screen adaptation by Clancy Sigal.Frida : A Biography of Frida Kahlo

My hope that a seemingly endless series of vignettes would build into something cohesive was never realized.  About five times during this oppressive dirge, I yelled out, "Direction!" A waste of time and money - wish I hadn't wasted nearly two hours of my life on it.

$review_text.: At first I was a little bit skeptical, since Jennifer Aniston, and sometimes her hair define a genre of "Jennifer Aniston" films, which is not the actress's fault. Aniston had a decent start with the "Good Girl" and "Along came Polly" and has a nice range. She can be dark and sexy, if you only let her. In "We're the Millers", Jennifer get's to play with Jason Sudeikis and Emma Roberts, which results in some luscious dark humor. I did not know what to expect from a rated comedy and we were wondering, why even risk this cinematic balancing act, but it pays off most of the time. The cast is hilarious and there are some unexpected turns and twists, which makes this story entertaining.

$REVIEW.: The stars that were in this movie...Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt all did a magnificent job. Sometimes the plot became a little murky or convoluted, but if you stay the course some questions are answered. Cameron diaz does a hell of a job as the big bad and that isn't revealing anything you see it from the start. Her motives and the how and whys though, to me, were terribly unclear. Lots of turns going on in the movie but the end piece....with Cameron...just don't get it. Sometimes I enjoy a mystery ending,in this case I wanted to know what the hell? Not much of a Brad Pitt fan...but I love that he has been taking these smaller parts...he excels as does the rest of this stellar cast. BTW love the cheetahs.

$review_text.: Legions of fans were left hanging about the fate of three faves, Connor, Abby, and Danny. This badly-named Volume 3 actually contains all of Series 4 & 5. It's a treat to finally see who, when, and how they made it back (one, quite temporarily) to the contemporary land of coffee and deodorant. Although Irish director Robert Quinn isn't given credit as a director on the box (who did he get in a fight with?), he does a great job bringing out the best in a super cast of hard-working actors. And many scenes are filmed in Ireland (many shots of "London" are actually Dublin), county Wicklow's seaside caves are sanctuary for creatures in Series 4, episode 5. Following this, episode 6's Irish castle features another past cast-member. The addition of the fine Alexander Siddig is always a good bet, though his part is rather thankless, and Ciar&aacute;n McMenamin is great too. The Victorian element also adds complexity as past, present, and future hang in the balance. Andrew-Lee Potts ought to be given a shot at Doctor Who, at the very least, and Hannah Spearritt gives a nuanced and fine performance, worthy of any theatre-trained actor, given the material. Ben Mansfield reliably lends credibility.The down-side: Producers clearly saved money by under-staffing ARC. The lack of personnel is quite obvious, making plot-lines that much more difficult to believe. As well, there's a dolorous lack of humor in too many stories, humor leavened past series, lifting Primeval to a higher level. Sadly, the show suffers from the lack of the gleefully villainous Helen, the excellent Alexander Siddig isn't given much to chomp on. Overall, everyone seems less happy, less vital, and there's far too little of the delightful Rex. Even mad Helen lent a crisp and biting humor. Now, we only see one character's austere (Dublin, not London) home, gone are all the playful scenes with Rex, Abby, and Connor in her flat. Missing are the costly visits to beautiful primeval worlds, sooty Victorian London and a terrible future-scape are the only portals much explored. Though this is done very well, fans may miss the previous series' spectacular scenes of dinosaur country, contrasting present-day environs with scenes filmed to looked like a cross between New Zealand and Hawaii. Still, fans are compelled to give it a go, and hope for more!If you haven't seen them, previous Primeval is even better:Primeval: Volume 1 (Series 1 and 2)&Primeval, Vol. 2 (Series 3)

$review_text.: Disney travels to the Grecian island of Crete to film this enjoyable tale of a young English girl, played by teen favorite Hayley Mills and her Aunt (Joan Greenwood), who are traveling the area in search of native folk songs.  While visiting Crete, Hayley meets young and handsome Peter McEnery, and is soon swept up into mystery, romance, and intrigue.  The film has a Hitchcock feel to it, and reminds the viewer a little of "To Catch A Thief" and "The Man Who Knew Too Much."  I believe it's the locales and the fine performance of Eli Wallach, as the jewel thief Strattos.  I highly recommend "The Moon-Spinners," it has a vacation feel and is quite enjoyable to watch, especially for Hayley Mills fans.  The dvd is featured in the full screen format, however, the picture's transfer is very clean and the audio sounds good.  I too, would prefer the films in their original wide screen formats, but just to have these Disney classic films available to add to my dvd library, whether full screen or wide screen, is something to be thankful for.

$review_text.: If I understand the meaning behind the great white buffalo alluded to in HTTM, I can unequivocally say this film is in and of itself a great white buffalo.  From the title to the closing credits, this movie is an absurd, preposterous concept that absolutely works and had me crying tears of laughter.Four downtrodden, depressing friends get together for a wild male weekend full of cavorting and camaraderie at a ski resort.  This ski resort is special because it's where three of them had some of the most memorable experiences of their lives in the 80's, and the trip is meant to reinvigorate youthful momentum and break adult monotony.  Unfortunately, the resort is now in shambles, not nearly what they remember, and depressing as hell.  Not what they expected.  When the four decide to obnoxiously drunk in a hot tub, you know what happens next: They are transported back to their debaucherous and exciting 20-something lives of Winterfest '86 where they careened recklessly down the slopes, dove face firstScarface-style into mounds of drugs, and bedded bimbo ski bunnies dressed in atrociously colored yet wonderfully form-fitting 80's attire (spandex is a privilege, not a right).  The rest is side-splitting comedy, as the foursome must make every attempt to make their way "Back to the Future" while possibly righting past wrongs.The main cast (John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry, Clarke Duke) is perfect together.  Tons of chemistry.  The supporting cast is just as good: Chevy Chase is the aloof hot tub repairman; William Zabka is the same character William Zabka always plays; and Crispin Glover is the oddball, one-armed* bellhop (a great touch considering his McFly roots in Back to the Future).  It's just too bad they couldn't find a bit role for Michael J. Fox.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the FACT that Rob Corddry absolutely steals every scene.With 80's references to pop-culture, music, fashion, politics, and everything else, the movie is packed full of hilarity.  When Robinson gets onstage to relive his musical glory days, I defy you not to bob your head and snicker at his "new" song.  When Corddry wakes up hungover in the hot tub and says hello to a squirrel in his own special way, there is no way you don't laugh.  And the "gag" joke between Zabka and Corddry is epic.  With the exception of the awkward insertion of a new love interest for John Cusack - a subplot never fully developed - the entire film is a compounded running joke that will evoke great memories for those who are fond of the era, mixed with various forms of laugh out loud comedy.  Add in an awesome soundtrack and a predictable yet completely fulfilling twist ending (it's the ultimate what if we all imagine if we were allowed to time travel), and this movie is easily the most enjoyable of the year.  While not quite on par with the cult status Hangover deserves, this film is very comparable, quotable, and hilarious.

$REVIEW.: I saw Sherlock Holmes at my local theater and immediatley loved it


There is only one word to describe this film and that word is "brilliant".The story takes place in Victorian England with a young detective named sherlock Holmes (Robert Downing Jr.) and his doctor named Watson

The film picks up at a mysterious temple in wich a human sacrifice is taking place

Luckely for the one being sacrificed Holmes, Watson, and the police come just in time to stop the killing


 The sacrifice was being performed by a devil-worshipper known as Lord Blackwood


 Blackwood is immediatley arrested and brought to trial for the murder of several women

He is sentenced to death and is hung
Later they bring the body to Watson and he pronounces Blackwood dead
But several days later a witness sees Blackwood rise from the grave in the local graveyard

Blackwood continues his killings and his powers are rapidly inflicting fear on the people of England
He plans to use this fear in order to in a way take over the world
Luckely Sherlock Holmes is such a brilliant detective that he can notice every minor detail in this case.I highly recommend this movie
It is action-packed, frightning, and even hilarious
Although you my need to see the movie more than once, the plot is very difficult to grasp.

Steve Martin does his best work here.  Martin Short is hilarious.  The Banks' are the kind of family every girl (or boy) wishes they had.  Even the inlaws are fun.

$REVIEW.: This film is full of what Westerners think of Japan--land of submissive all-suffering geishas, androgynous men, pagodas, bridges, and ceremonies.  There's no mention of noodle vendors, crowded narrow streets or (female) natives who are proud of their culture and race, who prefer NOT to leave their land for the West.  The geisha who becomes Brando's girlfriend willingly offers herself to him--he doesn't need to earn her love. This film portrays Japan and the Japanese as they never were, as much as "Gone With the Wind" was of the antebellum South.  It is an affront to Asians everywhere and such a film would never be made today.To its credit, it was made fifty years ago, when cultural sensitivity in the US didn't exist.  And it certainly doesn't have obnoxious scenes like the "Talky Talky" number in "South Pacific".  As for the film's merits, it is quite beautiful.  Shot in color, the Japanese landscape is postcard-picturesque.  The love story between Kelly (Red Buttons) and his Japanese wife is tender and helps illustrate the consequences of racist policies within the US military.  There's not a boring moment in this film as it is very moving.  But since I object to it on grounds that it perpetuates stereotypes of Asians by the imperialist West, I have to deduct a couple of stars.

$REVIEW.: This dark and somber picture deals with a sensitive and awful sexual abuse

A tragic chronicle that sealed three different existences

Add the physical wounds the unforgettable traces left in the mind and the soul
Three friends who just are in his teenages, one of them will be designed by the destiny's finger as the innocent victim of that crime.The silence will be the common denominator, but the damage is too big to heal these emotional wounds

And so slowly, the destiny will assume the form of a long cloud that literally will gather them again, thirty years later.Eastwood reached the peak as hard to beat director; with a simple story but rich in details and edition


Between you and me this film and 21 grams were the most pyramidal american films in 2003 but you know, the logic usually doesn 't apply as a mathematic equation, and this outstanding picture was simply nominated and nothing else happened


The cast is simply terrific

And the absorbing photography is another invisible actor.A film that will shock your senses for a long, long time!

$REVIEW.: I've always been fascinated with Watergate, possibly because it's the first major news event I can remember.  I was five years old; while watching TV with my Mom one day in August 1974, I was flabbergasted to see a podium with The Great Seal of the President of the United States.  Before I reached for the dial, my mom said, "Watch this - it's important.  You'll be glad you did someday."  I didn't really understand the significance of Nixon's resignation at that age, but those events are burned into my memory.Over the years, I've watched "All the President's Men" several times - most recently, after the revelation of "Deep Throat" as the FBI's W. Mark Felt. The movie never loses its excitement for me, and remains one of my favorite films from the 1970s.The tale of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they discover the true story behind Watergate could have been dry; indeed, director Alan Pakula, perhaps not entirely trusting the material, jazzes up the action by inserting ersatz "chase scenes" and other elements from standard thrillers.  But "All the President's Men" excites the most when Robert Redford's Woodward juggles phone calls to glean new bits of information, or when Dustin Hoffman's Bernstein extracts names from reluctant witnesses.  It calls to mind the heady days of investigative journalism, a time when brave men like Ben Bradlee ran newspapers, rather than today's corporate conglomerates.Pakula effectively conveys the reporters' struggle through a variety of techniques. A mournful Vivaldi trumpet duo highlights Woodward and Bernstein's loneliness as they fight uphill to break their story.  Shots of the two reporters against Washington's monuments - or most memorably, from the ceiling of the Library of Congress - eloquently portray the reporters' struggle against Washington's power structure.Both Redford and Hoffman deliver subtle yet inspired performances, aided by a stellar supporting cast, which includes Oscar winner Jason Robards as Bradlee, Oscar nominee Jane Alexander as a key witness, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Stephen Collins, Ned Beatty, Robert Walden, and others. Hal Holbrook portrays "Deep Throat," delivering perhaps my favorite line from the movie: "Forget the myths the media's created about the White House. The truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.""All the President's Men" should be required viewing for anyone interested in Watergate, investigative journalism, or politics in general.  In today's troubled times, with reporters going to jail to protect confidential sources and White House officials desperately trying to cover up the sources of leaks, we could use men like Deep Throat, Woodward and Bernstein, and Ben Bradlee again.

$REVIEW.: Dogs - those lovable, tail-wagging, stick-fetching, ruff'n'tumble quadrupeds who are one of our most frequent animal companions on this planet - can be fairly scary in real life if they're ticked off at you and snarling like a Harley Davidson engine trying to turn over; but making them genuinely scary in movies and other tales has often been a tough task.  Maybe it's just too easy to envision a big lovable goof of a german shepherd growling and stalking on cue like he's been trained to, but then reverting to chasing his tale or pestering for doggie biscuits as soon as he knows his performance is over, but the fright factor doesn't usually work with dogs like it does their cousins the wolves, or with various reptiles.  Usually, anyway.  "The Breed" is one of the few that's succeeded.  The canines here are cunning, big, aggressive and fast, and not at all hard to believe could be produced by a mean-spirited breeding program using conventional, non-futuristic, steroids.It's five friends vacationing on an island where a reclusive uncle (recently deceased) kept a nice beach house, who encounter the Breed, descendants of an old secert program at a complex (apparantly government-owned or sponsored) on the other side of the island.  There are vague clues that there may have been people suspicious about what was really going on at the compound, but nothing definate.  "The Breed" doesn't go indepth into the backstory, preferring to drop in a kind of broad opening into the Breed's origins and let viewers draw their own conclusions. Another intriguing area where the movie doesn't spell out exactly what's happening - and thus preserves a good aura of mystery - is the unusual 'link' that forms between surviving victims of the pack and the dogs themselves.  Having already established the dogs as realistic, it adds in something very strange but keeps it feeling real, making it more eerie and enhancing the whole movie. "The Breed" takes its time building into the man vs. beast action, creates genuine tension, and is largely devoid of improbable 'near-superhuman toughness and feats'.  One exception that's easily noted is the wound one of the characters receives early on, that certainly wasn't fatal, but that after the initial incident and subsequent treatment, doesn't seem to affect the character as much as it should.  You could still have her/him (I don't want to indicate which character it was) running about and such, but give a really pronounced limp to it when they're running along.  It's not a terrible mistake, but since I'm  praising the movie for being so believable, I thought I'd also mention the part where I thought it lacked a bit on that front.  Back on the positive side, the movie holds up with its thrills and effectiveness right through to the end, whereas some movies like this crumble quite a bit at the climax.With a talented cast, (including Michelle Rodriguez from "Resident Evil", "BloodRayne" and "Lost"), a nice island setting, extremely effective action sequences and well-done special effects, "The Breed" is a credit to the 'lethal animals' subgenre of horror.  Recommended.

$review_text.: I will second what so many critics have already admired about this film, it plays anti-Hollywood.  It is subdued and realistic; yet, there is poetic cinematography that enhances a small town romance.  I can't believe that David Green and Paul Schneider just hatched this script in a dorm room.  The miracle that a film like this can be made, the enormous cost of film, I am impressed.Paul is a nice Southern boy in the Smokey Mountains that has already tasted the town girls.  His mom is a piece of work and he's just shy of being a momma's boy.  Paul's best friend has a sister that has been away at boarding school for years.  (Yes, this is contrived.)  Zooey Deschanel is cute and ready for a love adventure after her cloistered years.  Paul is crazy about her, but sex with someone you love is an Oedipus moment, so things are beautiful and terrible at the same time.  If you don't understand, get a copy of Freud's Lectures, 1927.We totally related to the sensitivities of Schneider in this role.  They speak slowly in this town and feel deeply.  They are surrounded by nature and industry in turn.  My one complaint, well, maybe more than one, I thought Schneider a few years too old for this part.  Bachelors in their late twenties are a little more cynical or perceptive than Paul.  They know sex is great with lots of nice people, but when it's time to settle down, they already have their act together.  Now young twenties, that's chaos, which I think director Green was aiming at.

$REVIEW.: This movie should go into the Hall of Shame, as it has one of the better casts ever in a movie, and is still almost unwatchable.  In particular, when a writer creates a screenplay that threatens to take down the greatest actress of our generation (maybe ever) - Meryl Streep - then the writer deserves more than a Razzie.But it's not just the writer who is at fault.  The soundtrack is absolutely grating.  Now, I myself have always liked Carly Simon over the years, but Ms. Simon has many songs, many of them very good.  Why is it then that she, or those doing post production work, decided to use "Coming Around Again" over and over again, maybe with the original at first, and then variant instrumental versions?  Why not other songs, such as "You're So Vain" for example?  Wouldn't that song have fit the Jack Nicholson character as well?  Let's mix it up a bit here!In this film, Ms. Streep's character is a mess but she's supposed to be.  So, well played once again with what she had to work with.  But the movie feels like a mess as well, little scenes thrown in just because they seemingly have to be in any movie.  Weddings, dinner parties, pity parties, etc.  I would say that if you've just gone through a bad breakup and want to lay around and eat ice cream and cry like a little baby, this film might be just for you.  Otherwise, avoid at all cost.And don't forget to put the Tums on the coffee table while watching.  You're gonna need 'em. . . .

$REVIEW.: This was a wonderfully acted, well written movie. Riviting from start to finish. It realistically captures the feeling of one girls increasing mental illness realistically. The story is both disturbing and sad. This could easily have been a cheap, exploitive thriller but ends up being a superb drama with a lot emotion and fully rounded characters. Being based on a true story, it could have veered toward sensalism, but instaed, the script challanges the viewer to look at the characters from different view points and to have mixed feelings about them, the way we often do in life. It explores some very sad circumatnces that can place this young woman in a position of feeling a need to destruy someone else.The actors handle the characters that they are playing in a way that makes them complex and emotionally deep.

 A person who says he is broadcasting from a city in Germany is teasing the English with his warnings of disaster which often come true during the broadcast.Basil Rathbone is great as the detective figures out what&#8217;s going on over the blustering and cocky chatter that is typical of the British politician .The film is a bit dated, since it is occurring during World War II when the Nazi threat was real and invasion was a possibility
 Now it&#8217;s interest is historical
 The final villain is not that much of a surprise, a person gets shot for betraying Nazi&#8217;s and Watson says he knew who the bad guy was all along.Love these old Black & White shows with their fancy Universal logos and cool music interludes.Best Scene:  When Holmes is confronted by the Nazi spies and he lets them escape, to the shock of the council, which really was a puppet group, to be honest.There are better Basil Rathbone films of this time (Hound of the Baskervilles!)  but this one will do.Recommended.

$review_text.: I initially bought this because I thought Rachel McAdams was brilliant in Mean Girls and The Notebook, and I read on IMDB, that she's got the lead role in The Time Traveller's Wife (a book which I'm currently re-reading) opposite Eric Bana. Love the book, love her. Saw this for dead cheap, and although it sounds like a standard thriller movie, I thought I'll have that.The thing about Rachel McAdams is she never plays the same character twice, unlike so many of her peers. Plus, her look changes with every film, and I barely recognised her, with the reddish brown hair.Starring opposite Cillian Murphy, a truly creepy guy (I think it's the eyes), the two stars bounce well off each other, when they're the ones really holding the film up, as it's mostly about them. Rachel is playing a hotel manager, who is travelling back from a funeral. She's smart, she's tough, and she takes no nonsense. Cillian plays the appropriately named Jackson Rippner, a nice guy with a dark side. He befriends Rachel's character, buys a drink, and then reveals his Ace on the plane - he wants an important VIP, currently staying at her hotel, moved rooms, so he can be killed. And he also knows her father. And there's someone waiting outside his house, to kill him, if Jackson doesn't phone them at such and such a time.The third act is where it really lets the film down, when Wes Craven turns it into a Scream-chase-the-pretty-girl-around-the-house standard movie. It falls flat on its face here, but not so bad to ruin the rest of the movie.It's a truly claustrophobic movie, which is probably why I love these kind of movies. Makes me never want to set foot on a plane ever again. I'm glad I never travel alone either, because I can barely handle being in a pub (I always swap a ring onto my engagement finger), it's the whole thing that I can't handle being approached by someone in that kind of situation. The way Jackson approaches Rachel's character is just way too creepy for my liking. It's definitely worthwhile seeing. Plus the guys won't grumble too much at Rachel McAdams. I can't wait to see her in The Time Traveller's Wife.

$REVIEW.: The original Connery films (Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, and even the less-than-5-star Diamonds Are Forever) still stand head and shoulders over any Bond releases that followed them. There. I said it.I never gained an appreciation for Moore's Bond. I didn't care for the droll, smirky approach. Every time he unleashed one of his catty bon mots it just felt a little squirmy, you know?Any film that features Christopher Lee as the villain and Herv&eacute; Villechaize as his evil henchman demands to be watched, and for that reason alone, "Man With The Golden Gun" holds a unique position in the canon of Moore's Bond films. The scene with Lee in his room filled with mirrors as Villechaize intones "Where is your little gun?" is particularly  entertaining.Britt Ekland as the film's requisite Bond Girl? One of the worst, but the crown still goes to Maud Adams in "Octopussy."You say potato, I say potato. Roger Moore starred in a series of films featuring a character named James Bond. This was one of them. Connery brought the character to life, Moore kept it in the box office.

$REVIEW.: Every now and then it's fun to pick up a video you know nothing about--to not even read the back of it--and just experience it without any preconceptions or media hype.That's what I did with this movie and I was very pleasantly surprised.  It's a very spritely, optimistic, creative piece, about the glories and traumas of youth, of love lost and found, of small-town life, of longing for something beyond what one has.Not at all realistic-that is one of its attractive points. The bright colors used, the stylized clothing worn, the clean, white-washed look of the town itself all tell you that this is not a story to be taken literally or seriously(lordy help us if it were!), but a fantasy of sorts.The music is fun, as is the dancing (and I'm not really a huge musicals fan, so for me to be saying this is something), and the sixties look pervades.My only complaint is that it's too long. They could have cut a couple of the numbers to good effect. My theory is that just about everything--be it book, movie, play, whatever--is 20% too long and this one fits that bill.Still--you'll enjoy it. Sit back, relax, and let this film take you to a more innocent, carefree placewhere the sky is always blue and the people you meet on the street are always happy, or if they're not at the moment, they soon will be.

$review_text.: If you liked the first movie, Taken, then you will love this sequel. There are absolutely no boring moments and it kept me on the edge of my seat just like the first movie. Of course, watching Liam Neesom kick some behind is never boring and is always a good time. Like the first movie, in my option this is the kind of movie that you have to watch from beginning to end to know what is going on. I also suggest watching the first movie, if you haven't already, so you will understand the link to the bad guys and the location that they are in, and Neesom's protectiveness of his family. I absolutely loved this movie and due to the ending, I definitely believe there will be a Taken 3!  I hope you will enjoy this movie as much as I did.

It has a sort of twilight zone feel to it, and the organ carnival music throughout the whole movie was so eerie. Candace Hilligoss, who plays Mary Henry, did an excellent acting job, even for a B-Film. She is an amazing actress, and deserved an Oscar for her riveting performance as Mary Henry. I reccomend this movie to everybody, and would also like to thank Criterion for giving this awesome film such a beautiful treatmant.

$REVIEW.: Sorry folks-I love low budget, off the wall, extreme camp, all the cult films, etc but this one just doesn't cut it in ANY genre.  A lot of it is the same footage played over and over, same with the music. The sound quality is HORRIBLE, not to mention that a lot of the sound was recorded seperately and doesn't even match up to the moving mouths of the (dare I say?) actors.  I think Bruce La Bruce might have been shooting at an "artsy-fartsy, foreign" type feel with this film, along with the B & W thing, but fell WAY short.  The skinhead stays mute for about the first half, where he basically takes a very stupid & LONG bath, then dances around badly in only his boots, flailing his arms around like a chicken with it's head cut off. Purely stupid film.  I rented it, so I FORCED myself to finish watching it, hoping something, ANYTHING would develop.  The thing ended as stupidly as possible and made no sense whatsoever.  Do yourself a favor and rent something else.

$review_text.: Wes Craven's contribution to the horror genre has been a lot of "hits" and "misses"
Several of his films have become classics of the horror genre; "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Scream" are the two best examples of this while "The Hills Have Eyes" and "The Last House on the Left" have become cult classics but let's not forget some of his other failed attempts such as "Deadly Friend", "Shocker" and "The People Under the Stairs"
"Red Eye" differs from most of Craven's previous work because it's not a horror film


It's a slick, well-crafted thriller that features a great cast, some genuinely intense scenes and  heart-pounding suspense

Craven can gladly add "Red Eye" to his "hit's" list.Rachel McAdams plays Lisa- a young busy body who works at a chic resort Hotel
After attending her Grandmothers funeral, Lisa takes the "Red Eye" flight back home to Miami


At the airport, she bumps into a charming stranger named Jackson who offers her a drink and good conversation

As luck would have it, she ends up sitting right next to him on the flight
As their conversation progresses, it is soon made clear that the nice stranger isn't nice at all and his true motivations are exposed


It appears there is an assassination plot to kill a security official and his family but in order for it to go as planned, Jackson must convince Lisa via threatening her father's life, to authorize a room change for the unsuspecting victim in order to position him as a target

She must do it using the airplane's unreliable telephone and 30 thousand feet up in the air


Lisa tries repeatedly to outsmart her fellow passenger and a game of cat and mouse ensues.Finding a film that last under 90 minutes nowadays is a rare occurrence and one of the reasons this film had me glued to the screen was due to its rather short running time
There never really was a dull moment


The film didn't give me chance to get bored, get popcorn or even blink and the performances from the two leads were impressive


McAdams commanded my attention even during the film's less intense situations and Cillian Murphy proved he can be a mighty good villain.Like Schumacher's "Phone Booth", "Red Eye" is a fast-paced, well-executed, well directed time-waster where normal people are suddenly thrown into a violent, diabolical world of murder and mayhem

With a running time of just under 90 minutes, it hardly gives you a chance to catch your breath.Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Orson Welles, who was not known for his modesty, said that if a cabinet containing every film ever made caught fire and he only had time to run in and rescue one film, it would be the Grand Illusion (not Citizen Kane, etc).  Most people watching this film today might wonder why it warrants such high praise.  I say this because many of the themes in this film have been dealt with memorably in other films (the first time I saw the Grand Illusion, for example, I couldn't help thinking that I preferred Stalag 17).  As a result, the film appears to be less original than it actually was.  Modern audiences are also not used to the movie's themes being dealt with so subtly (no bodies are graphically blown up to show the horrors of war, no lower class characters are unjustly executed, etc).  Thus it will not attract as much widespread popular praise as such overblown garbage as Saving Private Ryan (which is a complete and utter failure as an anti-war movie after its opening 10 minute gorefest ends). In contrast, this film has a subtle depth which elevates its effectiveness and will keep the viewer thinking long after it ends.There are many illusions dealt with in the film.  The interaction between the upper class prisoners and the prison camp's commandant (excellently performed by Erich Von Stronheim) illustrates the illusion of civility that exists (or should I say existed) during war (people pretending to be civilized while trying to wipe each other out).  It illustrates the illusion of nationalism (except for the war, the officers are kindred spirits).  The illusion of class is also well portrayed with the commandant arbitrarily showing less favour to some prisoners because of their last name and for no other reason.  Viewers with knowledge of history will also note the irony in its theme of the decline of nobility and the ascendency of democracy given that this film occurs during a war in which lowly soldiers were ruthlessly sacrificed by their &quot;noble&quot; leaders in greater numbers than in any other war.One thing which makes this film different from most others about war or class is that it portrays the noble officers as worthwhile and positive people, but it treats all of its characters with equal respect.  This, of course, further illustrates the illusory nature of class.For a thought-provoking movie, it is also quite entertaining, filled with humour, suspense and great performances.  While I would not go as far as Welles in his praise of The Grand Illusion, it is still very highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: The Scottish-made television series "Rebus," filmed in that country and starring local boy John Hannah as the title character, made its TV debut in 2000
 It's based on the well-known series of the same name by Ian Rankin, who's now the most popular crime writer in the British Isles


Rankin is, of course, considered the founding father of the Scottish tartan noir school of mystery writing: a work that's darker and more violent than most, lightened, fortunately, by that grim Scottish humor
 Anyway, the show was released on video in 2006; it is a box of three DVD's that gives us the first four shows.It was the first of what has also proven to be a series of TV crime dramas, although further entries in the series star Ken Stott, rather than Hannah

 The production is set in Edinburgh, as are the books; however, aside from the briefest sidelong glances, we don't see much of that beautiful city beloved of tourists
 (Nevertheless, I went there a few years ago, and carved out for myself such a Rebus tour as time allowed; as I too am a rather longtime fan, and have read every one of the books save the last.)  There appears to have been plenty of money thrown at the screen; it believably portrays the life of a modern business city, with clogged streets, bridges and roads


 Cars, dress, housing and bars all look like the real thing.John Hannah, most of us know, achieved a lasting high-profile with his powerful funeral scene in 1995's "Four Weddings and a Funeral;" as it happens, I had first noticed him in the Glasgow-set "Taggart" series


 He sure is easy on the eyes, and I found him fine in the part; perhaps I'm not as demanding in this regard as a person of the other sex might be

 As to what Stitt, reputed to be a very good tv actor might do with it, well, I've no idea.As the first of the series to be filmed, the makers had their choice of books, and, as you might expect, they filmed four of the most interesting and powerful
 The first disk gives us "Black and Blue," and "The Hanging Garden."  "Black and Blue" is about a previous serial killer still at large, dubbed "The Prophet," and a copycat killer who's sprung up, dubbed "The Disciple." The novel won many awards, and helped to make Rankin's name: the plot's complex, and moves fast

 "The Hanging Garden" is particularly powerful, as Rebus's daughter is hit by a hit-and-run driver and seriously injured


 It also gives us a local gang war, a look at the illicit international trade in women, and a subplot about a World War II prison camp sadist who's escaped retribution, and gone comfortably to ground in Edinburgh.The second disk gives us "Dead Souls,"an exploration of child abuse, and is a story that makes particularly good, resonant use of its setting

 The third disk is "Mortal Causes;" it, like the book on which it's based, makes really strong use of the city's little-known corners, and centers, as did the book, on a plea for racial tolerance.All four episodes are just crammed full of plot; and may be rather difficult for anyone not familiar with the underlying books to follow


 They also all neatly, perhaps too neatly, have the detective solve every case within the allotted time:  He also did so in the books, but that seemed less troublesome


 Biggest problem with this series in my house was the sound track
 On the second disk, we sometimes had the volume turned up to near 100, highest it's ever been, and still couldn't hear the entire dialog
 Furthermore, this is a recently-made and -released series: why oh why doesn't it have subtitles?  Even when the dialog is audible, the actors are speaking, as we agree they should, in that city's strong accent


These American ears would have been totally unable to follow the action, had I not previously read the books
 That really shouldn't be so necessary, and I hope the further releases, starring Stott, are a little more helpful in that regard.

$REVIEW.: Albert and his friend Franz are young aristocrats enjoying Carnival on the Moon.  There, Albert meets and befriends the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo.  Some say he's an alien, some say he's a monster, some even say he's a vampire.  The truth is, he's a man (more or less) out for revenge.  Albert and Franz return to their native France, and Albert introduces the Count to Parisian society.  The plot unfolds over the course of 24 half-hour (well, 22 minute) episodes, but there's enough going on that the story doesn't drag (well, not too much).  The loveless arranged engagements of the young aristocrats and the machinations of their parents provide additional subpolts.The anime is surpisingly close to the original novel by Dumas.  Nearly all of the large cast of characters and most of the main plot points of the novel are included in the anime.  The main deviations are: being set 3000 years in the future, the exact nature of the Count, and the final fates of the main characters.  Plus, we don't get the Count's back history until much later in the series.About the look of the anime: some people may find it unbearable.  I don't have a problem with it, in fact, I like it.  There are two issues here, the first (and less distracting) is that the show is "a riot of color."  Movies in recent years have gone the opposite direction.  Everything's getting so dull, muddy, and blah.  I swear, some day some genius is going to invent black & white movies.  So to me, the riot of color provides blessed relief.  The second, more distracting element is the "2-D collage effect."  Surfaces such as clothing and hair are depicted as two-dimensional surfaces, and as the characters move, the surfaces change in peculiar ways.  For some, this would be a show-stopper, but again, I don't mind it.The English voice acting is about as good as amine gets.  The opening credit song is pleasant enough, but after a few episodes, I fast forward through it.  The final credit song is a blast ("You won't see me comin'/ til I strike!").  Additional music during the show helps to set the tone.  Ratings-wise, there's not much that's too offensive.  Well, there's a woman with her hand between her legs at one point, but it's not graphic.  I suppose that bumps it up to PG-13 or so.  (I'd rather not even have mentioned that, but some people would be offended by it, and if your kids would say "Mommy, what is the lady doing?" you probably wouldn't want them to watch it.)

$REVIEW.: This is a must buy for any Jazz fan. Licenced by the BBC for release in the U.S. but not available over in the UK, you get two sets of Garner with bass player Eddie Calhoun and drummer Kelly Martin. Even more amazing is that when the BBC repeated Jazz 625 in the 1980's they only showed one half the show. This disc contains both halves.As you'd expect the playing from Garner is incredible. Take 'Honeysuckle Rose' as an example. A long introduction, during which the drummer and bass player have no idea when they are supposed to come in. This features a little bit of Boogie Woogie and stride and then suddenly the tune starts and Garner is flying. The distinctive lagging right hand spells out the tune and then there are a few choruses of sparking improvisations. Then to cap it all a long stride section recalling memories of Fats Waller and culminating in a modulation through multiple keys to the finish.Garner alternates between his uptempo swinging stuff (or occasional mambo style) with his distinctively florid ballad playing, which creates a nice contrast. The picture quality is reasonable for 1964, and the sound is pretty good. There is a bonus audio only version of Misty played over some photos of Garner performing elsewhere.Buy it now before it becomes completely unavailable.

$REVIEW.: The Incredibles is a fully-fleshed out and developed computer animated story that isn't just another summer kiddie flick. The Incredibles family members aren't cookie-cutter cartoon characters but real people who just happen to look like something out of a cartoon. :-) The intelligent and well written script won the writers a best script award and along with the amazing special effects they combine to produce the best animated film in many years. The action scenes are entertaining as well as spectacular, and after a while you hardly remember you're watching an animated film because the plot and characters seem so realistic and true to life. Overall a great effort from Pixar and they'll have to work hard to top this one.

$review_text.: I remember watching this cartoon as a kid and absolutely loving every minute of it.  I was a huge fan of `The Chipmunks' and watched their cartoon's religiously, so it's only expected that with the birth of my first child right around the corner I would seek out and purchase some cartoons that I myself adore.  `The Chipmunk Adventure' I can honestly say still stacks up even in its old age.  It's funny and entertaining and enjoyable even in my adulthood.  The animation may not be as flashy and realistic as we have today but there's nothing wrong with a good old fashioned cartoon every once in a while.  The storyline is engaging, the characters are likable and the entire feel of this cartoon, the vibe and atmosphere is sure to excite and entertain any child.  There are a few things I found a little annoying but there's not enough here to really complain about.First let's discuss the storyline.  Dave, the Chipmunks father figure, is traveling to Europe on business and is leaving the boys in the hands of absent minded babysitter Miss Miller.  Alvin is none to happy with this arrangement for he wants to travel with Dave and see the wonders of the world.  He soon gets his opportunity when two shady strangers overhear a conversation, or a fight, between Alvin and Brittany (leader of the Chipettes) in regards to who could really win a race around the world.  It just so happens that these two strangers, Klaus and Claudia, are in need of some transporters to smuggle their stolen diamonds.  They devise a plan rather rapidly to send the Chipmunks and the Chipettes on a race around the world, having them deposit dolls stuffed with diamonds at certain checkpoints along the way.  Of course this group of young rodents doesn't realize the dolls are carrying precious cargo and just feel that these two creepy adults are rich and bored, and besides, the winner will receive $100,000 and that's about all the persuading Alvin and Brittany need.  So, Alvin, Simon and Theodore set off in one direction while Brittany, Jeannette and Eleanor set off in the other and each of them meet danger in varying ways.The film is filled to the brim with action and adventure and musical numbers.  The musical numbers, as hilarious as they are, present my first lukewarm feeling.  First of all, maybe it's just me, but was it easier to understand what they were singing when we were younger.  I had the hardest time figuring out the words to the songs.  Maybe children can hear at a higher octave than adults can.  Secondly, some of the songs are not songs I'd want my children to sing, some of them are somewhat suggestive ("get lucky with you") and just not for children.  I know this was the 80's and these songs were popular, but as a soon-to-be parent I find myself a little more judgmental of things.  Like I said though, this is not enough for me to really complain about.I also would have liked to see the boys really understand the danger in what they did, leaving home unchaperoned, trusting strangers...things of that nature.  Other than Theodore mentioning the guilty feeling once and Simon somewhat bickering in the beginning the boys never really acknowledge how wrong their actions were, nether does Dave for that matter.  I know this is a cartoon, but cartoons are notorious for morals and lessons learnt and I feel that this one could have established those a little better.  Regardless, this is still a fun time and not something I would hesitate to place before my daughter.  It remains a highlight of my youth and I'm hoping it becomes a highlight of hers.

$REVIEW.: What had instantly become a critical and financial hit, not to mention a fan favorite among superheroes perhaps less known, Iron Man produced a sequel only 2 years later due to it's immense popularity. Probably the greatest thing about the first Iron Man film is that, nobody really knew what to expect. Those outside of the comic book community in fact were not very familiar or aware of the Iron Man character like they were of Spider-man or the X-Men. In addition Robert Downey Jr. had not created a very positive reputation in the preceding years and most did not know about the director, Jon Favreau, and his ability to helm a superhero flick. Well as it would be, all of this rode in favor of the novice superhero filmmaker and gave him the chance to wow the world with this movie. Because movie studios primary concern 99.9% of the time is making more and more money they green lit what was sure to be another money hungry superhero blockbuster and production was underway only a year after the first film had been released. Now this can result in a few outcomes. The movie could be horrible having rushed a screenplay, been careless with casting actors and performances and an overall lack of quality control. Luckily this was not the case. Although it wasn't as good as the first film, all too uncommon to do especially these days, this was a good Iron Man sequel. I think part of the reason it couldn't be as good as the first movie was because now that we all know how good the first movie was we expect par or perhaps even better. No expectation of the first film gave it the opportunity to blow us away.

$REVIEW.: This is what cheesy 70's sci-fi is all about!  Bad hair, bad dialogue, and sexy-stupid costumes.  I must admit that I find this movie thoroughly entertaining and provocative, however.  There are several themes at work  here and the story operates on many different levels.  I also think that  the film is great eye-candy, even though it hasn't aged very well.The  film is engaging and fun, although I do agree that it lacks a bit after  Logan and Jessica escape, but it picks back up in Washington.  I could have  done without Box, what the heck was that all about, anyway?Where can I  get one of those transporters Logan beamed Jenny Augutter in on?

It's not a dry documentary, but rather a collection of "factoids" strung together in a generally entertaining and informative fashion.The skits are an major component of each episode and, for the most part, if you're a Cleese fan you'll enjoy them


A few dragged on a bit too long - I would have preferred a bit more information than entertainment in the mix

$REVIEW.: Overall, not as funny as I had hoped for, and a tad more gory then I was ready for.  This was a movie where the trailer was better then the movie.The movie follows a young outcast high school boy, as he decides to change his life, by becoming a Super Hero, complete with outfit and all.  However, his first confrontation doesn't turn out so well, when he is stabbed and beaten to a pulp.  Though that doesn't seem to deter him from trying again, after he mends up from getting out of hospital, which is when he meets Hit Girl and Big Daddy, the real take-no- prisoners-crime-fighters of the movie.  And Hit Girl, is awesome!  But it doesn't take long for the bad guys to find the newest Super Hero, and mistake him for the one damaging their business, when it was really Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  So the battles ensue, with a final blow out battle and somewhat happy ending.It was a great idea for a story, though I felt the movie fell short on delivering the story to screen.  I did like think the idea for the story was unique, as was the inclusion of the comic book story as a way of depicting the story.  It has some fantastic action sequences in it for sure!Though, it wasn't as funny as it could have been, in my opinion, or as witty.  Nor did I find the characters as compelling, as I wanted or hoped for them to be, which leads me to believe that the writing was a little lacking in character development, as well as story.I'm fine going to a horror movie and having some gore.  However, this movie, had way too much for my tastes.  And I don't believe it really needed the gore in it, to make the point or be visually entertaining/interesting.If you're looking for action and gore, with some humor, this might be just the ticket.  Otherwise, if you're expecting a really funny movie, and a great story, you may want to pass...It was somewhat of a let down for me, and one that would not be included in my library.

Thank God, I never had to face any of this, but the possibility was there. That may be why the movie moved me so much.

$review_text.: ** possible spoilers ahead **By "borer" I mean that it will bore you to death before it horrifies you
It's a shame too, I actually liked the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre that was done by Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes company
I was hoping that this would be similar, but the only similarity is that they are both remakes of horror movies from the 70's.To be fair, it's not like the original Amityville Horror was anything great
It, like the remake, borrowed heavily from other successful ghost stories of the time to try and capitalize on some of their success
No one will ever be able to convince me that George Lutz carrying around an axe in the original was not a direct rip-off of Stephen King's crochet mallet wielding villain in The Shining

I know, the film version of The Shining came out a year after the original Amityville Horror, but Stephen King wrote the novel of the Shining several years before the Amityville Horror book was written (or should I say plagiarized?)In the same fashion, this remake borrows heavily from the ghost stories that seem to be successful right now


Namely, the J-horror aesthetic of the little girl ghost
It worked in the Ring, and it worked in the Grudge, so it will work in Amityville Horror, right? Well, to be blunt..
no
It didn't work


In fact, it felt like the blatant rip-off that it was.But like I said, the original film borrowed from other ghost stories of the period, so does the remake


That's not the worst part of this movie, and that's not why I hate this movie so much.Where this movie goes wrong is that absolutely nothing happens until the last ten minutes of the film


The original had the same problem, but you'd hope that we would learn something in 25 years


No such luck


The main scares in the first hour of the movie are: Magnets rearrange themselves on the fridge, little girl goes into the boat house alone, little girl climbs up onto the roof, George Lutz complains of it being cold, George chops wood
I'm not kidding


There's no body count to this movie

Other than the DeFeo family, that gets killed in the first five minutes, there is not a single casualty.Which brings me to another thing that I hate about this movie
Does everyone know the true story of the Amityville Horror? It's not all that frightening unless you consider how depraved and ugly George and Kathy Lutz really were.George and Kathy bought a house they couldn't afford, a place where a mentally deranged kid named Ronnie DeFeo had shot his whole family
George and Kathy knew about the murders, they had a friend come over with pictures of the crime scene and they fabricated a whole haunted house story to help them GET OUT of their mortgage

Then they sold this ridiculous fiction as a book and a movie
They have made millions off of the DeFeo family tragedy
I find that a little disgusting


That's the TRUE STORY.But regardless of the truth, what's done is done


I hope that any surviving members of the DeFeo family sue everyone involved for defamation of character or something.Doing something stupid like giving millions of dollars to a con artist would be one thing, but then to make a really boring movie that's not even remotely entertaining is just a plain disgrace

It's a shame because I think Ryan Reynolds is hot as hell, and he's ripped to shreds in this movie, but it's not even good enough to skim through for the boy eye candy.

$REVIEW.: I start to think that I've watched too many movies or read too many books because I have a hard time enjoying sci-fi flicks.  I question why the hell, if creatures started appearing in the ocean, the solution would be to make huge robots, on huger budgets, rather than invest all that money in a detection system and a bunch of high power torpedoes/traps/rail guns/stun gun or anything else that would be more practical.But then I realize that there area sci-fi movies that have a good enough story line that I don't question the practicality because it's just a good movie (The Fifth Element, Oblivion, Original Star Wars, The Last Star Fighter).The special effects were great, the justification of the robots and story line, not so much.

$REVIEW.: I have always loved the "Dante's Inferno" but had forgotten about the Isadora Duncan film. Both these are included. I wish the Richard Wagner bio was included. Never had a chance to see that.When I was a college student, some professor showed us "Dante's Inferno" and I have never forgotten it. I loved the PreRaphaelites, and was familiar with both Dante's and Christina Rossetti's poems. The movie is about Dante's very private hell of regret and guilt, and the imaginative style of acting and symbolism really adds a lot to the story. It also provides an excellent intro to 19th century bohemian life. Oliver Reed's brooding style fit the character perfectly.The Isadora Duncan: the Biggest Dancer in the World story is also excellent, providing both information, and conveying personality, and something of the mood of the era. I had forgotten the movie, but immediately remembered Vivian Pickles, who was excellent as Isadora.Elgar was a bit of a disappointment, but the Rousseau Bio was excellent, and one I had never seen. Debussy was interesting as well, but not as successful, as some of the other films.Still, for the price, I am pleased to have found Inferno and Isadora again. Russell is underrated and forgotten.

$REVIEW.: Hollywood cinema tends to go through fad after fad after fad. Whether it's an onslaught of perverted teen comedies, cheesy horror movies for the faint of heart or corny chick flicks with the same script and just different actors, they tend to wear themselves out beyond their welcome so Hollywood will move onto a new fad. Ever since Spiderman swung into the box office Hollywood has decided that superheroes would be the new big screen thing. So now it seems that superhero after superhero is finding his or her way onto the screen (even the less know ones such as Hellboy).Obviously the American public has taken to superheroes so it only seems right that Hollywood pump out another one, so we are given The Punisher. A little bit of background info: Frank Castle is an FBI agent who has decided to quit due to lack of time for his family and the potential of putting them in danger. He pulls one last job which (try and catch this ball hit into left field) has gone unexpectedly wrong. A young man, who was not supposed to be there, is shot down in the course of the undercover operation along with numerous other people who were there. The young man, however, is the son of Howard Saint, a rich tycoon who has his hand in crime. Wanting vengance for his son's death, Howard, in occardance of his wife, orders all of Frank Castle's family to be killed. So they are....except Frank who miraculously survives a bullet at point blank range to the chest and an explosion. After being nursed to health Frank takes up house in an apartment and sets out to exact his revenge on Howard and everyone tied to him. Along the way he meets a few allies but mainly keeps to himself as he takes down Howard's crew one by one.So since The Punisher has a comic book series of his own does that automatically make him a superhero? Well what superpowers does he have? He can get beat beyond all recognition and still save the day and he can hold a lot of weapons at once. Superhero or no superhero Frank means business and he uses the abilities bestowed upon him to get it. Now how accurately his methods are to that of the comic series I'm not sure (I was never big into comics) so I can only base the movie on its own merit.I never credited Thomas Jane with being a great actor and his role of Frank Castle/The Punisher doesn't raise him a notch in my book. However I have seen the better side of John Travolta and I was somewhat disapointed in his portrayal of the villain in this movie because I've seen him do it so well. It's like he decided to take a break from trying and just kind of lay back for this one. The rest of the characters don't leave any lasting impressions in their roles so it's somewhat hard to get into loving/hating characters until later on in the movie.So how does The Punisher stand as far as being a 'revenge' movie? Well he kills people unmercifully so that automatically qualifies it.  There's not much here as far as actions scenes go to make it a bright shining light in the genre but it does have some clever moments. Instead of straight up shooting some of the main 'villians', Castle uses his intellect and plays with Howard's mind through a nice set of tricks he has cooked up. This makes for an interesting touch and shows a much more intelligent side to our hero than posed in most revenge movies.The few scenes of clever intelligence and a nice final death scene don't save this film as it suffers from multiple things (lack of character depth, severe boredom in some scenes, a poorly acted script, done over action scenes and just kind of dumb at some points). While The Punisher is probably worth a rent if you've got nothing better to do and does make you somewhat impressed at certain points it still leaves you wanting more. I give The Punisher a 5 out of 10 (or 3 stars).

$REVIEW.: This movie was beautifully put together. The black and white with slight yellow colorwashing was a good look for the story and added to the heat.The basic storyline is that a murder was committed in the woods and the only few people that have a clue as to what happened tell conflicting stories. The underlying storyline is that everyone involved lies or bends the truth when they're telling their stories to the officials. Every one of the people, even the dead man's tale through the medium, try to make themselves look better rather than tell the truth and have the situation resolved.Very beautiful music and coloring and storytelling methods. Kurosawa did a wonderful job on this movie and it was very enjoyable.

$review_text.: Kate Hudson is prettier than her mother, but she doesn't have half her range.  Nevertheless she is well cast as Isabel, particularly in the scenes in which she finds herself drawn to her enigmatic uncle, Edgar Cosset, played as a sophisticated pundit by the one and only Thierry Lhermitte.  When Edgar appears on TV, don't ask Isabel to do anything but stare at the screen.  Even if the house was burning, she'd be there slack jawed forgetting all about anyone else she's with.  I felt sorry for that other boyfriend Isabel had, that little nothing with the frizzy, greasy hair, but he was too much of a boy to compare to the magnificent Thierry Lhermitte.He gives her a red Kelly bag which she then totes everywhere as a symbol of his love, and consequently everyone finds out that the two are involved.  We, the viewers, can see a mile ahead of Isabel and know he's just using her, quel tragedy.  If it was me, I'd have stapled myself to Thierry Lhermitte's iconic fesses before I let him kiss me off with a silk scarf, no way, Jose!Obviously author Diane Johnson was interested in doing a French version of the Sylvia Plath-Ted Hughes story.  In both stories a female American poet, very pretty with blonde hair and two children, a boy and a girl, find themselves trapped in a foreign country when their sexy native husbands just dump them for younger, darker, more ethnic seductresses who also happen to be married.  And then the female poets at the center of the storyline attempt suicide.  The only difference in this story is that you would have to imagine that Sylvia Plath had a younger, peppy sister who went to England to help out and wound up sleeping with Ted Hughes' uncle.  Case closed, except for, the way Matthew Modine plays David Wevill, Wevill should sue.  The whole movie falls apart everytime Modine hogs center stage with his demented ramblings.  French police in real life would have shot him in an instant the first time he steals Kate Hudson's striped umbrella in the rainstreaked courtyard to her building, yes, and packed him off to Devil's Island, good riddance.

A key part from Theon's story and it was completely axed from the show. It's a shame too because Ramsay is a character you'll love to hate and most people do in season 3. And then we have Roose Bolton. He was the one that went to Harrenhal and should have been the one having interactions with Arya, Not Tywin.The Boltons are key players in the series in book 3 and on and yet they barely get seen/heard from in this season. I think if they had used this season to build them up, Their impact in season 3 would have been a lot more powerful.I understand that budget problems and things of that nature can effect things but when it's about essential characters, I just can't stand it. That is why I did not care much for this season.

$REVIEW.: A very good movie. As I have said before, Al Pacino said that Colin Farrell is the best actor of his generation, and I TOTALLY agree.  This movie is very well played by Al Pacino, Colin Farrell, Bridget Moynahan is good, too.  I didn't know that her sister is Michelle Moynahan until recently. I think she has more acting skills and potential than her sister.

$review_text.: Angel Heart never quite got the critical acclaim it deserved
Long before Mickey Rourke was reduced to doing Iglesias music videos, he actually had something of an acting career

In this, perhaps his best work, although not his best known, he plays an amnesiac private investigator sent on the trail of a 1940s crooner/singer named Johnny Favorite

While some of the plot twists are pretty evident to modern viewers (some later films have used similar twists to further their own plots), they were quite novel at the time of the film


The eerie film-noire atmosphere gives everything a sinister, seductive feel, and, while you can pretty much ascertain the identity of the PI's patron (Cypher), the identity of the elusive crooner remains a shocker at the end


Also, if you are a jazz fan, the eerie jazz of Trevor Jones provides a suitably melancholic atmosphere to the film
Lisa Bonet, the Cosby show's wild-child, performs admirably as a voodoo priestess who is also the daughter of Favorite, and the eventual lover of the PI
Rourke is great, as he was in those days, reflecting more emotional range than he was allowed in more notable films in which he participated, namely 9 1/2 Weeks and Wild Orchid


De Niro oozes diabolical smugness and a certain sinister quality that you just cannot quite put your finger on (yeah, if you READ the name of the guy, you know what he is...but those seeing the movie didn't have that luxury until the end credits ..

MUCH better in this role than Pacino), and this is one of my favorite roles for him


The film works in a little bit of everything darkly occult, from benevolent, poor but soulful black-folks in voodoo cults, to rich and powerful white-folks with their secret devil worship to keep them rich and powerful


Set against the mysterious bayou backdrop of New Orleans, which only serves to enhance the spooky atmosphere, this film is a classic for anyone who is a fan of film noir.

Loved seeing Angela Bettis doing a less eccentric role - this girl is fast becoming one of my favourite horror stars. She shines in the lead role.As ambiguous as the killer is, I found the whole unknown factor quite fascinating here. Creepy damn building with some great kills and scares. For fans of horror only, PG-13 "horror" fans won't find much to like here.Enjoy!

$REVIEW.: Perhaps Fassbinder's most revolutionary film, Petra von Kant manages to combine the stunning cinematography of Michael Ballhaus with very deliberate symbolism and a brilliant script of viscious circles to create an art form at once prosaic and highly intellectual at the same time. Fassbinder brings the theatre back into film (or maybe the other way round) and, as in 'Martha', we feel so strongly connected with the main character as to feel all the pain and agony.  This movie is one truly powerful cinematic experience. One gets a sense of the often chaotic and emotional life that Fassbinder himself must have had.

$REVIEW.: BLOW OUT is probably my favorite Brian DePalma AND John Travolta movie.  Often criticized for his derivativeness from masters such as Hitchcock or others, DePalma found a niche in this film that he never really recaptured (with the exception of THE UNTOUCHABLES, but it's a different kind of film).  DePalma's trademark kinetic cinematography and plot twists are evident, but they don't seem as forced or contrived as in some of his other films.  I've never seen BLOWUP, and sometimes I hate it when people tend to compare similar films.  Let them stand on their own for whatever their merits might be.  This is a stunningly performed and hypnotic thriller, buoyed by the performances of both Travolta and Nancy Allen, who first appeared together in De Palma's brilliant CARRIE.  John Lithgow is very effective in his role as the killer after our stars.  Dennis Franz gives another solid performance as the sleazeball who sets Allen up with the presidential hopeful.  Some of the scenes where they're trying to get a good screamer for a horror movie Travolta is working on are priceless.BLOW OUT culminates in a suspenseful finale at a Liberty Bell celebration in Philadelphia and his decision to slow mo the Travolta rush to save Allen is mesmerizing and agonizing at the same time.  Flashy thought it may be, I love the scene where Travolta and Allen are in the foreground of the fireworks.DePalma was at his peak here and I have enjoyed this movie four times since its release.

$review_text.: First let me say, I absolutely LOVE this movie! I recently purchased the "Don't Call Me Shirley." Edition on Amazon.com


It was hilarious as always


It's also great to watch it as an adult, LOL

Anyway, my only issue with this version of the DVD was the bonus features
Now of course it may have just been operator error, but let me explain what happened..

I watched the original movie with no problem whatsoever


Then, I went to the special features and started the audio commentary

There was still no real problem other than it was a little boring for me

Then, I chose the other option, which was the "long haul" version which had deleted scenes and interviews with the directors anytime an icon came onto the screen
The very first time the icon appeared, it automatically goes to the interview

However, I was unable to hear any of the dialogue at all! So, I tried to go back to the original version of the movie and now none of the dialogue could be heard either
Only the background music

At first I thought maybe it was my DVD player, but I tried another DVD, and there is no issue at all
I may have to return it if I can't figure out what happened

So be very careful when ordering
It may be better just to have the original version with no fancy bells and whistles


Just my opinion

$REVIEW.: (...)Blue Velvet comes from my collection of Chinese bootlegs

My sister Bethany and her husband Brian are teaching English in China

Apparently you can purchase a wide assortment of DVD's there very cheaply


So I supply them with big lists of movies I'd like and when they come home they bring me a big stack

There are never any special features on the DVD's, but the picture is usually good and for $1 a piece, that's all I need.Blue Velvet is dark, scary, freaky, and really good


Which is how you cold describe most of David Lynch's films


His films are often filled with symbolism and it is easy to finish one of his films and have no real idea of what actually happened
They usually take two or three viewings, and a little research to get a good idea what the movie is actually trying to convey
Blue Velvet has a simpler plot that can generally be understood at a basic level upon first viewing, but there is plenty of symbolism and deeper meaning to make it "enjoyable" for further viewings

I put enjoyable in quotation marks because to many watching it is not an enjoyable experience

It is a movie deep seated in horror, with scenes that make you crawl under the covers and lock the doors

For the cinephile it is a type of pleasure to watch a lurid piece of cinema with enough depth to require multiple viewings
For the weekend movie watcher it is probably too much to stomach.The film starts with an idyllic, picturesque small town
It's a town where every day has blue skies, manicured lawns, pretty flowers, and quiet simple people

Lynch fills the screen with gorgeous pictures straight out of fifties television shows


But this is a David Lynch movie and the pretty pictures don't last long

Quickly a nice old man who is watering his lawn falls down near death
The camera pans down past the convulsing man and deep into the grass
Digging into the earth until the camera is dark with freshly wet dirt and grotesque bugs


The idyllic town is only pretty on the surface


Underneath the top layer of goodness lies a darker, seedier town hidden from the eyes of most of its citizens.The plot of the film revolves around Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern delving deeper and deeper into the darker side of the small town


MacLachlan finds a dismembered ear on his walk home from the hospital one afternoon

Finding such a macabre in his hometown sparks a quest to discover who's head the ear could belong to and why it was removed

He involves the good girl Laura Dern in his quest and they sink into darker waters


To tell more of the plot is to give away too much
I'll just say that it is not for the weak of heart.Dennis Hopper plays one of cinemas creepiest villains to date
His psychosis is even more terrifying in that it is so real


Here is no Freddy Krueger, or even a Hannibal Lector


This is not some crazed psychopath lurking in the corner

Sure he is psychotic, and maniacal, but versions of him can be found almost nightly in any major city newspaper

He is not a homicidal maniac, but a violent, evil man made even more so by his addiction to unnamed drugs.Isabella Rossellini plays Dorothy Valens with such beauty and sadness it breaks your heart as it squirms your stomach


Her character has taken such horrible abuse over her life she has come to like and enjoy it
Mixed with heavy amounts masochism her performance is remarkable.There were several times while watching this with my wife, Amy that she said she couldn't keep watching it
After the credits rolled she said she would never watch it again


I suspect this is the sentiments of many viewers after watching Blue Velvet

But if you can stomach the violence, masochism and overall creepiness there is a lot of pure cinema to study.(...)

The cast is made of terrific actors from many countries, even if they're not celebrities, they're far more talented than those who have made it big in Hollywood.The sex and violence are there but they're NOT extremely graphic, and everything was tastefully done.Is a visual feast and the directors and producers really went out of their way to visualy bring this old world back to us in every aspect you see from the sets, costumes, props, etc.All lovers of the ancient Greek tales and mythology should own a copy or at least watch it.

$review_text.: I have been a fan of Artie Lange's since he was on MadTV
 His appearences on the Conan O'Brien show were hysterical

So, when he took over the "Jackie Chair" on the Howard Stern Show I was thrilled

 Of course with his success on the show it was obvious to all the regular listeners that Artie was going market something eventually

 When word of the DVD first came out on the air I knew I would buy it, but I didn't hold out hopes that this would be a great stand-up act
 I was wrong.Artie's stand up was not only funny enough to make you laugh until you cried, but it was extremely original
 The vast majortity of the act was funny, well-paced and at times even a little insightful


 When it failed it is not for lack of trying, but some of the material isn't worked out very well


 A classic bit is Artie's observations on Harry Carry.Is it the best stand-up ever, no


 Is it great, yes

 Is it worth the money?  Absolutely!

$REVIEW.: An exploration visits mysterious Tibet. The Englishmen are searching for a rare flower that only grows in Tibet. The natives are afraid to visit a valley from which no man has ever returned, it is said to be inhabited by demons. A missionary warns them against this, but they press on for their quest. A strange animal attacks one, but is driven off. The plant is harvested and returned to London (it only blooms under moonlight). Wilfred is obsessed since his return. They have strange plants in that museum, they eat insects. Dr. Yogami of the University of Carpathia visits, he too is a student of plants (like that moon flower). Can this flower be an antidote to werewolfery? A pet dog is suddenly upset, then Dr. Yogami enters. The film shows a camera that shows anyone who visits the laboratory (the latest in high technology). An old book explains why a human must be killed by a werewolf each night - to be able to return to human form.Night transforms Wilfred into a werewolf before your eyes! He then leaves to prowl the streets. There is an attempt on Miss Edie, but her guests think she was drunk. The next victim doesn't escape. Wilfred and Lisa are invited for a moonlight ride. Wilfred won't go, but Lisa is stubborn. There are some jokes sprinkled to carry the plot along. Wilfred seeks a rented room for isolation (like "The Invisible Man"). The film shows another transformation of Wilfred to Werewolf. Then another victim. Dr. Yogami visits Scotland Yard to warn about werewolves, but they don't believe him. [Note how people don't want to accept warnings about some future problem?] Wilfred visits a place where he can be locked up. But there is another transformation and another attack on a woman. The police suspect Wilfred, but can't find him. Dr. Yogami visits the laboratory to steal the last flowers, denying the antidote to Wilfred. Now Wilfred goes to attack Lisa, wandering in the moonlight. But the police arrive and fire a bullet to end this tragedy (like "The Invisible Man"). There will be a cover-up of the facts. Nobody will believe the story of a werewolf! Would you?This film resulted in many sequels which continued until this story was played out. The story can be seen as a parable about addiction to a drug that men will kill for. Or a romance where an unhappy wife's husband conveniently dies after an old love returns. This is an interesting story as long as you don't question the situation. The later Hollywood version created a new reality about werewolves, silver bullets, full moons, etc. so they became part of popular culture. [Warner Oland's acting style is similar to his "Charlie Chan" films.]

$REVIEW.: It is no wonder there are complaints about the Blu-ray transfer of this 25th Anniversary Blu-ray edition with the Blu-ray on one side and the DVD version on the other side of the same disc.  It's a Universal picture.  This is the studio notorious for putting four films on the same disc of their Hammer franchise or even their original horror monsters along with Ma and Pa Kettle, etc.  For pennies they would sacrifice your hard-earned dollars and do not care how much you complain because they are a very large studio.  The screen during some of the vista of the African countryside are blotchy.  A DVD is more often clearer."Born Free" (1965) causes me to cry every time I see it.  "Out of Africa" was a long way to go for a downbeat ending.  And as an epic it does not go very far, it is not as involving or even compelling, although it does say some small things rather effectively.  Perhaps I am being too hard on it, as these small things added together have a nice message.  Robert Redford seems a little too old to be playing these romantic parts, Streep is good, but I would never say Jane Fonda did not have the capability to out-act her, at least, by her performance in "Out of Africa."  The best thing about "Out of Africa" is John Barry's music which augments the stunning cinematography by David Watkin and editing.  Barry's music for "Out of Africa" lifts the film out of any mediocrity into any higher achievement it deserves, which is ample as it won Best Picture.  Barry has created many beautiful passages and where one film may have only one central theme song, Barry has created two equally beautiful themes:  the Love Theme ("The Music of Goodbye") and the Main Theme.  And I guess a studio like Universal doesn't value its own Oscar winner enough to provide exemplary home video of it.  That's the real story.  Don't spend the $6.88 at Big Lots.  It's not worth it to have a piece of junk for your money.  If you can accept the poor Blu-ray version, then one side of this two-sided disc may malfunction.  But then you won't have to throw away a whole set of non-working discs.  But then, don't they deserve it?

$REVIEW.: I simply love this series, every minute of it.  Sort of like Angel, though much less tongue-in-cheek, deeper, and LOADED with heart.  Reminiscent of both Once Upon a Time and Person of Interest, in mood and tone, I thought.As another reviewer said, each episode gets better and better, building slowly, developing character, and expanding the scope.  We begin with tragedy, and the birth of a being with superhuman powers, a la Superman- invincible, thrilling, see what he does to bad guys!  ("My God, what ARE you??" they cry, as he metes out justice and rights wrongs.)  But slowly, it builds, deepens, exploring the nature of good and evil, death, our purpose here, redemption, soul mates, the power of love, and much more (such as recovery, friendship, healing).  It keeps all these balls in the air while developing the characters, we come to care about them, know them.  The plots are simple, actually incidental, the characters and their relationships with each other are core (as in any good story).The series is actually one long story- characters reappear, threads begun before are taken up and brought to fruition throughout, often in unexpected and surprising ways.  Appropriate, too, I would say, for older teenagers (maybe 14 and up) and for spurring family discussions.  The series handles a wide range of issues honestly, yet tastefully (addiction, for example).Mark Dacascos is simply marvelous as The Crow- alternately enigmatic, powerful, troubled, lost, charming, funny, an innocent.  Is he a lost soul, adrift between worlds, an angel, what?  Whatever he is, he's simply beautiful, in every guise and phase- his face, his body, his martial arts moves, the way he rides his Harley, the way he walks, grace personified.  And I love the way he delivers clever/funny quips, however great the menace.All the actors are topnotch, and the show at times features beautiful scenery and special effects.  It also showcases music (in smallish doses) from alternative bands, and credits them at the end of each eposode.  And unlike the original Crow film on which this is based, we get to see rockstar Draven sing and perform, and Dacascos excels there too.This series is subtle- it doesn't hit you over the head with things, the dialogue is simple, yet effective- to sum it up, it's absorbing, moves you from laughing out loud to tears to cheering for the good guys, just splendid, inspiring.  And for this price...Grab it!  I intend to buy another for backup.

$REVIEW.: WE WERE PROMISED! Back in 2011 when Volume 1 was release we were promised Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat would be restored and included with these releases


I'm not spending any more money on Tom and Jerry DVD releases

We the collectors went through this with the Spotlight Collection
Remember that fiasco fans

Remember how The Spotlight Collection Volume 1 had edited and censored cartoons and we had to mail back the discs so the WB could mail us back the discs they originally intended to have in the set

And all for the build-up when Volume 3 was released and ALAS - NO Mouse Cleaning, No Casanova Cat! And a statement from WB that they were deemed inappropriate for release.Welcome to the same old situation

I thought with these Golden Collection releases they would make it right, but the WB's day of grace has passed as far as Tom and Jerry is concerned

I'm not spending anything more on them.

The picture was maded in 1954 and the events obviously occurred during thelate 1940's or early 1950's which makes the story very powerful.

$REVIEW.: You would think that just by looking at the movie poster and the title, people could figure out the characters are gay...most of the really low ratings seem to come from those who were surprised. If this bothers you, you probably should stay away. Similar to "The Kids are Alright" the characters just happen to be gay, it's not all that integral to the plot.I admire Carey for taking on roles like this since he could have made more money just playing Ace Ventura for the rest of his life. McGregor is sort of wasted in this movie; he doesn't do much other than provide motivation for Carey's character. The fun part of the movie is watching him go from cop to con man; not being very successful at either career.

$review_text.: The Kentuckian, 1955 filmA man and a boy cross a river with their dog Pharaoh. They are going to Texas (which attracts other settlers). Pharaoh barks, a horn recalls him. The man dreams of Texas as an answer to crowded Kentucky. There is a dogfight. Elias Wakefield is held as &#8220;suspicious&#8221;. [No Miranda warning?] A woman feeds his son, she is indentured servant. There is a family feud too. Two men are hunting Wakefield. But a bondswoman lifts a key to free Elias. The Sheriff finds them and will take them back. But a deal is made for their freedom, and they continue their journey with Hannah Bounder. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got take things as they are.&#8221; They must earn their Texas money there. They fish for mussels in the river. One mussel has a whopper pearl. A &#8220;windbag&#8221; sells medicine to the gullible. Will he buy a pearl? President Monroe buys pearls. [Is this a joke?]Miss Suzy teaches school. Will little Eli learn his letters? Suzy plays the piano and sings [for entertainment]. Is any man too old for school? Elias is told of the trick. Little Elias is taunted at school, he answers back. Elias is taught about the quality of tobacco leaves by Zach. Ely learns to not turn his back to the other children. The hear the steamboat whistle. A man asks for volunteer emigrants, he describes the richness of Texas. [No mention of the Comanche Indians there.] Ely apologizes for disrupting class. Hannah offers Elias the money for Texas; she sold herself into bondage to Bodine. Elias and his son go hunting and forget to visit Miss Suzy. There is a letter from President Monroe for Zach (with money). [Note the type of letter envelope.] Elias is sent on a business trip. There is gambling on the steamboat. [Note the shills to entice gambling.] &#8220;Nine wins!&#8221; They leave the steamboat quickly! Eliad buys for the crowd. [&#8220;Easy come, easy go.&#8221;] Elias&#8217; new clothes marks him as a businessman, not a hunter or laborer.Elias has settled in. Two men show their prowess with a bullwhip. One man instigates a fight between two boys. &#8220;I dare you!&#8221; One boy has a bullwhip! His father is called, he knows what Bodine did. There is a fight, Elias is losing. But the fight is equalized. Wakefield wins and is lauded by the crowd. There is a new development for Elias and Suzy. &#8220;No Texas?&#8221; Little Ely accuses his father of lying. [Do circumstances affect opinions or judgments? Yes, you have to adjust for changed circumstances.] Suzy tells what Hannah did. A horn tells of little Ely&#8217;s changes [you don&#8217;t see this]. The two Throne men are at Bodine&#8217; home, they will wait for Elias. They tell Bodine what to do! [He squealed!] Hannah loads the musket. Elias quickly crosses the stream before a man can reload? Are they safe now? They will go to Texas.This story is taken from Felix Hart&#8217;s popular novel &#8220;The Gabriel Horn&#8221;. Is it an example of revisionist history? Do some parts seem implausible? I doubt that young Ely would not have a firearm of his own (if he could afford it). This story is unusual as having a bonded servant as part of its story; this is usually censored from academic history. Many immigrants would finance their trip to America by indenture. [Its not too different from going into debt to pay for a college education, isn&#8217;t it?] I wonder if they planned a sequel to this story? James Madison was President from March 1809 to March 1817. The year 1816 had one of the coldest summers ever recorded. A volcano explosion generated dust that limited sunshine for warmth and crops. [Does everything look too clean for a village on the frontier? Too few people there?

$REVIEW.: Freier Fall, in which two ostensibly straight males fall into bouts of illicit lovemaking in inhospitable locations, plays like an adolescent homosex phantasy. It's accordingly derivative and predictable, like most films that put homosexual arousal center stage, then figure out a scenario that will make the inevitable lip-locking as implausible as possible for the biggest pay-off. With rare exceptions (Marco Berger's Plan B comes to mind) this inevitable meeting of mucus membranes eventuates with the suddenness of an act of desperate violence. To that end Stephen Lacant spends an inordinate amount of time establishing the masculine bone fides of the protagonists, to such an extent that it threatens to become the main focus of the film. Given the plasticity of the male sexual response in homosocial environments, the scenario of two police cadets getting the hots for one another is not incredible--but neither is it novel or particularly interesting. Lacant has merely produced his version of the standard doomed gay romance. Films dealing with homosexual persecution and paranoia have been made since the 1970s (Wolfgang Peterson's Die Konsequenz and Claude Miller's The Best Way to Walk come to mind)--with greater nuance and humanity. The experience of inconvenient homoerotic arousal in and of itself is an insufficient thematic for average filmmakers, I don't care how much splicing and edgy verit&eacute; stylization its packaged in. Protagonists whose sole purpose is to channel anomalous sexual predilections wind up as ciphers of animal mediocrity.Freier Fall's similarity to Brokeback Mountain has been remarked upon. I would draw parallels with another recent film about illicit homosexual bonding, Nicolo Donato's disturbing Broderskab (Brotherhood 2009). Again, the comparison is to the detriment of the formulaic Freier Fall. Donato's film was vastly superior because the homosexual attraction wasn't front & center, but one factor in a complex of engaging, if rather horrifying, themes.Max Riemelt, who plays Kay is a telegenic and engaging presence on screen, if not quite in the league of Volker Bruch in terms of intensity. Hanno Koffler as the repressed (or just clueless?) Marc broods with the best of them, but has the physicality of a Guinea Pig on steroids. A walking muscle-mass with tunnel vision, hair-trigger fuse, and a lecherous-malign glint in his eyes, he resembles a figure out of a Lucas Cranach portrait. Yet for all his irascibility, borderline autism, and  inarticulacy, he's not particularly spirited.With cortisol surges and the fight-flight reflex dictating events, flying fists and sudden retreat are the inevitable outcome of every encounter that doesn't end in furtive homosex. I get that these two are struggling with illicit desires in a no-win situation, but their inability to converse with one another as persons radically limits their appeal. That well-spokenness kills the mood of rude and randy man-on-manism seems to be a generally accepted fact among primitivists and pornographers, but give me a break. These two academy trainees spend all their time either working out, fighting, or having sex. (You know, like real men...) Oh, and Marc has a pregnant girlfriend who turns into an real nag when his interest wanes, sealing the deal of his straight-arrow credentials.Romance risks comedy when it confronts lovers with the necessity of its normalization. Once domesticated passionate partnerships generally transform into delicate, maintenance intensive stand-offs. Kay and Marc, inhabiting the realm of non-negotiable erotic impulses, never get that far. Their relationship, while tested by divided loyalties, lacks the civilizing dimension of habit and the intimacy of two minds meeting in sympathy. It remains a conflict (fight) resolved by the (SPOILERS!) sudden absconding (flight) of one of the partners.

The reason why I gave this 3 stars is for one reason and one reason only, no Widescreen

It's a slap in the face to the fans and the cast members out there who have worked hard making this film and the fans who have supported the musical over the years.As an avid DVD collector, I like to buy Widescreen because I never liked the thought of having a film 'cut to pieces' to fit my TV screen


Annie 20th Anniversary of course is no exception.Hopefully Columbia will hear our voices about this and release Widescreen in the next few months...with the same extra features.I'm not giving up on this, not by a long shot

$review_text.: I read some negative reviews on the Hills Have Eyes 2, the remake
But after watching the movie I am wondering what people expect, Shakespeare? This is horror people not rocket science...Good horror movies deliver atmosphere, shocks, twists, and most importantly scares


While not a huge fan of the 70s versions of the Hills Have Eyes, I loved the orginal remake in 2005


I thought it was the best horror remake I had ever seen
And after viewing this sequel I am again impressed


This movie delivers


Its gross, and it shocks
The caves and desert terrain that the hideous mutants hide out in provides a dangerously forboding atmosphere

Throw in the mix the impending threat of decapitation, rape and torture and the scare factor climbs pretty high.

$REVIEW.: The acting was great

Despite society's taboos, Barney 's life spins out of control from smoking and drinking while he gets and marries his ideal princess, Miriam, while recently being married


He should have gotten an annulment from his second wife


While pursuing Miriam she has flaws, playing moral lecturing cat and mouse, ie taking his obsessive calls from a married man, and not pursuing other men


After a decade of marital bliss, Miriam explains to Barney, that she is going back to work as a TV host


 He gives his machissimo control freak speech, that he is the bread winner


He, out of vicious neglect, failed to attend her first TV interviews, watching hockey games habitually at a pub and getting drunk

He did the same abandonment trick at his second wedding


After some snide jealous remark over a colleague's sexuality, Miriam leaves him for space, taking her son along

After Barney has a one night stand despite his begging for forgiveness, she moves in with  her work colleague waiting in the wings

 Princesses dont tolerate mistakes
His main concern after the cheating mistake was if he caught an STD and was devastated by Miriam's final total rejection

There is no slap or profanity as his 2nd wife called him an animal in the end because Miriam is too fragile incapable of expressing emotion and she is a princess
As for relationships, it reminds me of Annie Hall.

$REVIEW.: I first saw this film when it was a new release in theatres and I was nine years old.  My parents always took me to see Gary Cooper films because he was a fine actor and he always gave a beautiful performance and as with "High Noon" we have the same kind of performance here.  A man being pulled in many directions by his faith, his wife, his son, his friends, his country and having to make his way through it while trying to satifisfy the needs of all involved and to follow his own conscience.  It's a beautifully photographed film and all of the performances are convincing and evocative of people caught up in a terrible national crisis and trying to decide the best and right way to respond to it.  As an adult watching the film, I think of the allusion to the Bible -- the rural setting is peaceful and abundant -- the Garden of Eden -- with little intrusion from the outside world and then "the serpent" enters in the form of the Civil War -- tempting a young man to put aside his Quaker upbringing that emphasizes non-resistance and non-violence -- and yet -- we know that at the heart of the war was the ugly beast of slavery -- and the war was being fought to end that abominable practice in the United States. Some writers today want to deny that the war was fought for that reason -- yes, it was economics -- but it was an economic system in the South driven by slave-holders whose economy was built on the owning and labor of other human beings.  So the war enters the picture as the serpent entered the Garden of Eden and the Quaker family and their fellow Quakers are faced with a dilemma -- resist -- fight to protect themselves and at the same time protect the union and end the slave trade or refuse to fight and attempt to use reason and the example of compromise and non-resistance to resolve the issue.I loved the film in 1956 and I love it today because it is a timeless classic it entertains and at the same time it makes you think and examine your own conscience.

Keanu Reeves plays a much darker character than any I've seen him do before, like an updated Humphrey Bogart, and his darkness actually makes you forget how cute he is, not an easy thing to do.  Lucifer's evil is convincingly subtle, and the conclusion is great, not forced and definitely not a letdown.  Worth watching.

$review_text.: Get Smart the movie uses current gags for humor while the tv series used dialog

 This difference makes the movie very different from the tv series that disappoints many core fans
 The movie is entertaining in its own way, spoofing Entrapment, Alias, and other spy movies along the way
 One must always have a dance scene in a spy movie.What was disappointing was Siegfried and Starkel, who both lacked the goofy incompetence and humor found in the original series

 Sure, Max was a goof, but Kaos was even more inept than Control.The 2nd disc is not worth the extra money in a special edition
 The gag reel is rather short and could have been included in the 1st disc
 The 1st disc presents the alternative jokes in a very aggravating manner

 It forces you to watch the entire movie and it is constantly interrupted with the phone booth elevator
 Only by pressing the enter button when the phone booth is shown, will the alternative gag line be shown

 Very tedious to be constantly interrupted and having to press the button to watch the gags

 It would have been much easier and entertaining to watch the gags the standard way with their own menu.Overall the movie was entertaining, but the poor special features in the 2-Disc Special Edition results in a 1-star deduction due to the higher purchase cost
 The single disc edition is good enough and a better value for your money

 Wished that other reviewers could have explained the 2nd disc in more detail, would have saved some money and only purchased the single disc version


 If you already have the single disc version, no need to buy this 2-disc version.

$REVIEW.: Delicately told love story from its unexpected start to its slow death is beautifully performed by Ryan Gossling and Michelle Williams.  Michelle  plays a girl (Cindy), nursing student with ambitions to go to medical school.  She is attractive and smart, comes from the middle class family and has affinity for kinky sex.  Ryan (Dean) portrays a young man who is a high school drop out and works for the moving company.  Through the set of circumstances, this unlikely pair finds their way together.  Their inital attraction is genuine and generosity and kindness of the young man is sincere and unconditional.  So is his love for the girl of his dreams.  As it usually happens in relationships, there is always one person that loves the other one more and in this case is it Dean that loves his girl more.  However good his intentions are, his drinking, lack of ambition and desire to improve his circumstances and circumstances of his new family are taking a toll on relationship.  Cindy, once carefree is suddently looking worn out and exhausted from being a mother, wife and a part time student.  Before our eyes we see their love story and marriage unravel and it is easy to relate to their loss at some point.  The end is not surprising but it is a plot that helps bring the movie to its reality in its conclusion.Plot, performances and music in the film are great.  However, the camera in some parts of the movie is wobbly and for that reason, I give this film 4 stars instead of five.

$REVIEW.: My review title, I hope, answers a query I saw in a another review.This rather tired genre at first delighted me--it reminded me how Japanese films from the 1960s are so similar to the Norwegian and Swedish stuff. No wonder the tags are so confused...I mean, after all, this could very well be a film about a Kazhakstani camel-driver who retires to the Ukraine!But the Norwegians, who strike me as almost Vulcan-like (cheap "Star Trek" reference) are far too weird and placid for my taste. Example: in America, a man would not break and enter one place just to get to another place...then sit and visit with the child of the house, as occurs in this film. In the end, Norwegian film is at its most annoying when it is trying to be funny or slick.Now to the delicately beautiful about this film: the lead actor is a knockout. I haven't seen him before, but his pal "Flo" played the priest in the 1990s film "Hotten", known in English as "Bloody Angels". The lead is like a marriage between Sir Ian McKellen and Wyatt Earp. He's shy, quiet and reserved, has a quiet sweetheart he seems to want to marry, and visits his mother at the nursing home, dutifully. He's like an overgrown child, which it seems to me most Norwegians like to play in film.As a pipe smoker, I found the lead's love and need for the security blanket of his "Lillehammer" brand pipe most endearing. It's hilarious when he goes into the store, then like a frightened steer about to go to slaughter, he freaks a bit because the old proprietor isn't there in the tobacco shop--it's his widow.Once Odd (Bard Owe), our hero, knows who she is and sees that she is knowledgeable, Odd tells her why he's there and he gets his new pipe. Significantly, he abandons it near the end of the film: it's no longer a security blanket and he no longer seems to need it.The ice storm and its consequences--the storm that hits while Odd is out for a few drinks is so hilarious I leave it to the viewer as a surprise.Don't be shocked by the silence; there are probably about 25 speaking lines in this film total. Norwegians like their pretty pictures and beautiful cinematography, but they don't seem to like dialogue. In the Norwegian films I have seen throughout my life, I notice all the players seem quite angry when they have to speak lines.So, be ready for a somewhat amusing, not too deep, meditational yet clich&eacute;d genre here. I took away one star for all of the above negative observations, and for one last thing: I don't want to have to pay more than $15 for a DVD of a film like this.That's what it would cost me to get a new Weber pipe!
$SUMMARY.: O'Horten=O
