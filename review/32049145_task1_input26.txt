$REVIEW.: In a book of this length you don't expect so much depth. From the wine making process to mistreatment of Lucia's sister, I was amazed at the amount of story that could be packed into this book.I loved the Characters. Lucia is spirited and completely lovable and easy to relate to.Marco is the perfect hero- honest, fair, and let's not forget a totally Dominant, Italian hunk. I'll take him. Please, can I have him.Along comes Lucia's twin sister Celia and we really get to see the hero step up and be a hero- and we also get some hot sex scenes.But, then as all those crafty authors do- that Renee leaves us begging for more and so thankfully Courting Celia is available now too.

$review_text.: Oh, Courtney Milan knows how to wring the emotion out of a reader, doesn't she? From Jonas and Lydia's first abbreviated interaction to how Lydia unravels the mystery of the good doctor, I was hooked

And now I want to read book 1 like whoa because what I've read of this series is ridiculously good and I want more

MOAR.So


Lydia and Jonas

The position he's put in when he first lays eyes on her is painful
While he could have spoken up and done something, he didn't and she ended up paying for it

On the other hand, Lydia rallied from an event that could have defined her in a most tragic way and she ended up a strong, confident woman
As an aside, I adored her father

His honesty when Lydia asked him why he was willing to stand beside her after her mistake laid me low


In a good way.I genuinely liked the relationship that bloomed between Lydia and Jonas


Jonas is blunt -- sometimes painfully so -- and he believes knowledge is power
He talks about sex openly and he's uncompromising on being honest

Which is kinda awesome because he flat out tells her how he feels up front

Yeah, she doesn't believe him due to the preconceived notions she has about him but he lays it on the line and never wavers from what he feels.I like that in a man.Sarcasm, blunt talk, and a steamy kiss or two make for a fantastic book

$REVIEW.: It was considered a bad omen when Katalina was the only pup in her litter to survive. She tried to overcome the stigma of her birth, but eventually she was forced to go on the run. Silver is the Alpha of his pack and didn't think he'd ever find a mate, until he meets Katalina. There's only one problem. She's been infected with a disease that can turn her into a monster without control. The lovers must find a way to overcome Katalina's condition, stop her father from hunting her down, and face a slew of conspiracies at every turn. The story leaves us with a nail biting cliffhanger that will have you clamoring for the next book in the series.Abomination is a fast paced novel filled with non-stop action. The author creates a whole new world and puts a unique spin on both werewolves and vampires. Yet, those are only a few of the creatures you'll encounter. There are demons, wraiths, dragons, elves and so much more. I love the way she describes pack life, and how some packs choose to live in mansions while others are more primal. In the midst of all the battles, there is also a sweet romance that explodes into a sexy love affair with steamy scenes that will leave you panting.  I was totally pulled into the fantasy world of Xosha and look forward to reading the rest of the series.

$review_text.: I must confess to have on rare occasions engaged in what Bob Servant describes in this book. Responding to a spam e-mail message expressing interest in their "proposal" and then quickly cutting them off. It is one small way in which you can get back at the harassment and waste of time that the generators of such messages create.However, Servant takes it to a new level, some of the messages he sends to the "mark" are so absurd that it is astonishing that they don't get the reverse scam sooner. It is also hilarious; Servant sends a message even more ridiculous than what the spammer sent him yet they respond in all seriousness, still trying to troll for the bank account information. The scams he deals with are:*) Russian woman looking for romance*) African trying to take wealth out of a country (three times)*) Foreign company looking for a local agent to market their products (three times)*) Company looking for people to work at home at a high salaryServant has written a book containing actions that we all want to do, namely string along a scammer with your own scam, forcing them to waste their time and effort chasing an empty trail.  It is a taste of their own medicine and sometimes they find it a rather bitter dose.

$REVIEW.: Kill The Storyis a very good mystery. Plot was highly original and will appeal especially to those who disapprove of the invasiveness of reporters (though the revenge in this case is harsher than deserved). Pacing was good, and kept me reading. Progress of the investigation was credible. Characters were interesting and intelligent. Ending is a nail-biter and highly satisfying.Two negatives in my opinion: some gratuitous cursing; also I've read mysteries that are slightly more uniformly gripping, though I'd put this one in the top quartile for "grippingness".Very entertaining. At $2 it was a great deal, too. I highly recommend it.

$review_text.: Life was good for Roy Page. Then he lost his father to Alzheimer's, his marriage of twenty years fell apart, and his business took an economic downturn. Then his son had an injury that had the potential to destroy his baseball career. While his son was in recovery from the surgery, Roy took time to be with him and to contemplate fatherhood and his own life. He decided to write Evan a letter.He gives the letter at the beginning of the book and then writes about each of the sections. "The contents are my heart, my soul, and my story." (5) He reflects on his own life, Evan's life, growing up in church, his strong faith, Evan's athletic experiences, and he parallels Evan's healing from surgery with his own healing from divorce.Roy admits that part of the reason for writing the letter was to heal his own pain. "...[I]t provided a platform for my own healing and recovery..." (27) He is very open and honest about his own mistakes and living through the consequences.He says of the trial he has been through and his life now, "My purpose is to use my gift of creativity, my spiritual gift of faith, and my entrepreneurialism to inspire people to be the best they can be. I would never have developed this renewed purpose if not for this trial in my life." (109) He believes, "this book is a part of God's purpose to give hope and encouragement to His children, who He loves, who are experiencing the same pain I have endured." (150-1)Roy's healing may not be what most people experience because he had a personal counselor and an executive coach to help him along. He notes several times the progress he made only because of their influence on him. He admits that he has been blessed beyond measure knowing that most people who experience divorce do not have such advantages.This is an encouraging book for fathers, especially fathers who have made mistakes in their marriage and parenting roles. While Roy had a great deal of professional help to get him through the healing process, there is still much to gain from reading this book.I received a complimentary copy of this book through the B&B; Media Group for the purpose of this review.

$REVIEW.: I truly loved this, definitely the best adult angel/fallen angel story I have ever read! Do not hesitate and read it, you won't regret it.Serah is Power angel - she protects the innocent from evil. She believes in goodness and happily serves the God and his purpose. But after her brother becomes fallen angel and she is ordered to establish the truce at the border between "the righteous and the wicked", Serah starts to ask herself questions. Questions about what is good and bad, questions about life and humanity, questions that need answers. And the most important question is - how can you cooperate with the Devil himself?Yeah, we all know that Satan (or Lucifer as he prefers to be called) is the bad guy. Rebelling against God, bringing people into temptation, etc... But what if there is more into him? What if there is still a little bit of compassion in him? A little bit of goodness that noone else bothered to look for? Seems like Serah may be the only one seeing hope where other see only damnation. But is it wise to trust the Devil?I have to admit that I was smitten by Luce. He was arrogant, mocking and bitter but never vulgar or disgusting. I knew I should not fall for the Devil himself but I was truly fascinated by him. He was able to push all Sarah's buttons and their banters or discussions made extremely intriguing read out of this book.I am not going to tell you more since I want to avoid spoiling the story for you. But believe me, once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down! Extinguish is thoughtful story written in brilliant and beautiful writing style which only J.M. Darhower can master. Yeah, I admit it, I have a girl crush on this author and her stories. Everything she writes appeals to me. You simply cannot go wrong with the book by J.M. Darhower! This is her first paranormal story and I loved every single moment of it.Story is wrapped up nicely by the end, there is no cliffhanger but I have a feeling there may be a sequel coming... Who knows? I definitely know that I would be more than happy to come back to this paranormal world and characters J.M. Darhower created in this story.

$review_text.: If there were many more such home cheese-making books on the market as competition I may have given this book only one or two stars, but it is one of the few so it does hold value through that alone.There is really no time given in this book for describing the taste of the expected finished cheeses. This would be useful in deciding which recipe to put your effort into, as well as for determining how close one's  product came to the mark when finished.There are fairly large gaps in the instruction as mentioned elsewhere, leaving one to chance an interpretation of the recipe for the direction to take as opposed to having it plainly stated. For example the Farmhouse cheddar recipe doesn't say anything about rubbing salt into the outside while drying nor placing in brine. Other cheddar recipes in the book do require this step and elsewhere in the general text it describes why it is important. Was this left out intentionally from this recipe or not needed in this case?There are lots of little examples of these questions which arise throughout the book. The point is that though this book has great potential, the fact that it is in its third edition is unbelievable considering how it lacks cohesiveness and finish. It has the feel of a home published first attempt by an experienced cheese maker with no experience writing books but tries very hard to get it done.This book should be handed over to a professional for clean-up and it would be far more useful.

I was reminded too much of The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price or the Omega Man with Charlton Heston; even an episode of the Twilight Zone, "Where is Everybody?" Even more, I hoped that Wiley wouldn't lead me down a road where zombies would be waiting for the protagonist.Fortunately, there weren't any zombies.I liked this story. I liked what Wiley ultimately achieves with the story line. Though some reviewers have faulted this book for having a lousy ending, I was particularly impressed with the way he handled the twists and turns in the story and you will too if you give this story and author I chance.I did.Thanks for the good read, Mr. Wiley.Jeffrey Miller,When A Hard Rain Falls

$REVIEW.: Unrequited love between best friends is a tale as old as time and has become really overdone lately, but Jennifer Armentrout tells this story right; realistically.  Right away at the beginning we meet Sydney and learn that she has been in love with her best friend Kyler for years, but she thinks it's unrequitted.  Kyler is your typical playboy hottie (ie. perfect book boyfriend! swoon) and Syd is such a goody goody that she thinks there's no way he'd go for her and he thinks she's way too good for him.  Like I said, a little cliched.  What I love though, like I said in the beginning, is how realistic it is.  As they are stuck together on Christmas break, they both struggle with their feelings for each other.  It doesn't happen over night, it happens naturally as they spend more and more time together.  I LOVED that it was in dual POVs, but it was SO FRUSTRATING!!! I just wanted to yell "SYDNEY, STOP OVERANALYZING, HE LOVES YOU!!!" and "KYLER! CAN'T YOU SEE HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO HER?!"  I also liked the little bit about the mystery vandalism at the house because it added some drama other than the whole "he loves me, he loves me not" angst.  And finally finding out what the tattoo means? SWOON! I mean seriously, can Kyler get anymore swoon-worthy?  All in all, I loved this story and although it was a bit predictable, it's a must read!

$REVIEW.: I read the first of the Fatal series as a free book.  The mystery was good enough to keep me interested, but I did think too much time was spent in the bedroom.  Instead of just ordering the next book in the series to see if I really liked Marie Force's books, I ordered the rest of the series.  The mysteries were OK, but way too much information was given about Sam and Nick's bedroom activities.  I really don't need to know they like to experiment with sex.  I did read all of the books so far in this series since I had bought them.  I won't be buying any more.  I want my mysteries to be mysteries.  I don't want explicit details of what a couple is doing in their bedroom.  I did learn a lesson from this.  If I find a book I like that is part of a series, I will only purchase one book at a time.If you are looking for a series where a couple is featured, try the J.D. Robb series.  These are set in the future (New York in the2050s), but aren't that futuristic.  She's a cop and he billionaire computer wiz.  Their bedroom/office suit is a frequent setting in the story, but J.D. Robb writes with less sexually explicit details.P.S.Marie Force responded to my comments.  She pointed out that her books are romantic suspense and not mysteries.My intent was to let other readers know the sexual content of these books pushed my comfort zone.  I prefer to let my imagination fill in the details.The J.D. Robb (Nora Roberts) books I mentioned above are also romantic suspense/futuristic suspense, though they are classified as mysteries at my library.  The relationship between Eve and Roarke is an important part of this series.  The bedroom scenes are not as descriptive.

$REVIEW.: In a contemporary, conversational style Joel Miller has written a new biography of Paul Revere. Using words like "gig" and "cranking away," Miller brings Revere into the 21st century using an easy to digest tone.This is an excellent introduction to Paul Revere's life, it is readable without being overly bogged down by minutae. While Miller does get into specifics about what Revere's financial situation was from year to year, it is always in the context of the overall financial position Revere occupied in the community of Boston.The book incorporates illustrations of engravings and drawings Revere created as blueprints. Each chapter has the added detail of a small, italicized introduction in a historical style.What I enjoyed most was the humanization of Revere. No longer a crazed man on a horse screaming "The British are coming!" Revere becomes a man with talents, passions and a fondness for his local alehouse. He had a family, friends and grieved the loss of his child Mary.Easy to read. Enjoyable.

His descriptions are excruciatingly long and drwan out and this the good story moved too slowly.  One is informed at the beginning that this is Part I, but just when you want to know more, the book finishes without a hint as to how you can get access to Book II or even if there is one.  That is very unsattisfying.  I felt gypped.  Thus, the two star rating!

$review_text.: In Myra McEntire'sTimepiece: An Hourglass Novel, things are still going badly for the members of the Hourglass. Though Kaleb didn't think he had the time-travel gene, he's starting to see time ripples and something feels very wrong. With demands and threats coming from both the man who murdered his father and a dangerous new stranger, Kaleb and the other Hourglass recruits must decide which risks to take in order to fix things or else the very fabric of time may be altered forever.Though I didn't enjoy McEntire's debut,Hourglass, as much as I would have liked, I went into reading TIMEPIECE with the hope that it would be a better experience for me. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Even with Kaleb as the new narrator, the writing and the story never pulled me in. Kaleb's voice felt too forced in its hormonal, "guy" nature, and Kaleb's feelings and personality shifted too much in a short time span to be believable. The time-travel and "veil" mythology also became even more murky and convoluted in this installment. Because I didn't understand how the world worked, nothing ever felt like a real risk because I didn't truly understand what was going on. When conflicts did arise, they were resolved much too quickly or too easily and the moments of dramatic tension never felt that way. Because of all of these things, I felt uninterested and uninvested in the characters, their relationships, and their troubles.On the positive side, readers do learn more about the Hourglass group and their history, as well as about the villains and other adversaries. Even though I didn't enjoy Kaleb's voice as the narrator, some might appreciate his tone, and it does provide a welcome change from all the "sparking" and swoony talk of Emerson in the first installment. Lily, Emerson's best friend, takes on a major role in this sequel, and she is easily the most interesting and complex character in the series. Her spunk and personality added life to the tale and often kept it moving along during some of the slow parts.Though this series doesn't seem to work for me, I'm glad that others enjoy it and its ideas about time travel. In the next book of the trilogy, I hope McEntire brings greater clarity to her time-travel mythology and that she raises the stakes for her characters in order to create an engrossing read.Note: This review refers to an advance review copy.

$review_text.: A friend, knowing I'm an avid birdwatcher, suggested I read this biograpy of Phoebe Snetsinger and her obsession to add to her life list after being diagnosed with incurable cancer.This book stays with you long after you have finished it
Aside from being a fascinating look at those who obsess about adding birds to their life list and will travel and do almost anything to add a missing bird, the book leaves you thinking about choices


Choices Phoebe made with regards to her life and her family and her obsession

Choices Phoebe made with regards to her health

Choices she made with regards to her four children
It is also fascinating to review those choices against the background she flew out of - that of a 1950's housewife.The book fascinated me enough to reserve her autobiogaphyBirding On Borrowed Timefrom my local library!

$REVIEW.: The concept of sending &#34;plain&#34; people to colonize other planets (although, are they really &#34;other&#34; planets?) is an interesting premise. The juxtaposition of people who living technology-minimal life and their thought processes vs. people who grew up plugged in and how they might interact is very interesting.The story is not finished and I am eager to see where the next installment takes the characters - does Dawn have even more ulterior motives? What's Eagels' back story? How did Amos come to power and will he remain a benevolent leader? Where was Jed during Amos' rise to power and how does he fit in with the grand scheme of the SOMA?Plenty of plot twists and action keep the story singing right along and I didn't want it to end. Like any Really Good Book, Pennsylvania has inspired me to research some of the philosophies Bunker explores and question some of my own.Well done!

$review_text.: In the second volume of the old republic, threat of peace, we are put in a story similar to the situation from Episode one. The empire and the republic are still at war, but the sith are attempting to overthrow the jedi secretly while proposing a peace treaty. Although the sith are working as individuals, and for the jedi that are fighting the fight alone, well, the pressure makes them stray from the true path of the jedi way. This story creates complete different characters than the first volume, which bothers me. The plot and the characters are present, but like the first volume I find it difficult to connect with them emotionally. I also feel like they're so many things happening at the same time that I became confused at times...I give this book an even 3/5 stars!

Oh, it's very dark, and intense, but what has always struck me about Joey Comeau's writing is that I haven't read anything else that makes me feel like friendship is the best thing, just the best thing ever.  There were things in the book that were really creepy, in a classic, ghost-story way, and in a much more unsettling way.  I highly recommend it.  It is fun to read-- that was the second trick.  Because I read it, and then I tried to summarize the plot and I thought, "What the-- what IS this?"  I'm going to read it again, but I've lent it to a friend right now.

Well, Cosmo for one.  He's too independant to accept a sugar-daddy but he just can't resist the guy.  These characters and really original and well-drawn.  This is definitely a book I will want to come back and read often.  Also it's more than the usual two-hour read, so I really felt I got my money's worth, especially considering there is a free add-on story you can get here called "Scewing The Fags".

$REVIEW.: I am the first to admit that I am extraordinarily picky about things like proofreading and editing.  Call it a personal quirk.Hoodoo is not my personal tradition.  I picked up The Conjure Workbook thinking that it sounded interesting and I might be able to learn something from it - and indeed, I might have, had the book been READABLE.Unfortunately, it's narrated in a fake "folksy" style, complete with dialectical spelling (putting in an apostrophe instead of a "g," for example, to indicate the way a word would be said rather than writing the word correctly).  There are so many grammar, spelling, punctuation, and organizational errors in this book that I kept reaching for a red pen.  I realize that this author is known for plain speaking and common sense and I respect that - but there is a difference between the way someone talks, and the way a book is written.  The fact that this book was published without anyone, presumably, pointing out that the "voice" of the book is almost incoherent confuses me.  Family stories are jumbled in with instructions, explanations of motive and meaning mixed in with history, and not in a sort of conversational style that leaves the reader feeling as if they've just had a chat with a friend.  This reads as if someone decided to write a book, sat down, fired off a first draft, never showed it to an editor or any other literary professional, and had it published.To be honest, I'm astonished that Pendraig Publishing put this out without putting it through a major overhaul. It's disappointing, and it's certainly going to affect my purchasing from that house in the future.Let me be clear:  I am not criticizing the CONTENTS of the book.  While I'm interested in Hoodoo, and have studied the practice, I am not a Hoodoo practitioner.  The information inside the book may be absolutely needed and completely accurate, I have no idea.I am an omnivorous reader with high standards and a vast collection of books on spiritual topics, and someone who used to work in the publishing industry.  I find it absolutely bewildering that a book this amateurish has made it to print, and that so many people have found it enlightening and learned so much from it.  I am highly critical of the way the book is written, not of the information contained within it.  I wish Ms. Casas the best, and I hope to see a second edition of this book eventually, proofread and edited and put forth in a professional way.

$REVIEW.: Love this series. I was amazed when i stumbled on the first set! I mean how brilliant, write as a person writing a blog during the zombie apoc! Publish as a record of events! Love it! Love the characters! Love everything, keep it up!One of the better zombie series out there! And dear lord have I absorbed all level of them!This account has it all! Zombies, survival, fights, questioning of morality.I suppose what makes this series stand out is1) the zombies evolve (so not for hard core zombie traditionalists)2) the descriptions of the adaptations the survivors have to make to be safe and to eat3)the personalized feel of all posters (self doubt, disagreements with eachother over structure of the compound, dealing with outsiders, learning to fight)4) several groups that are well described including the mauraders, and bad guys in later booksThese are just some of the things I really. It is a really immersive story, on occasion you want to rush to the compound/Haven and help them survive the next problem. The characters are just normal people in crazy circumstances, attempting to do the right thing and occasionaly failing miserably. But they persevere, and I keep reading.
$SUMMARY.: Still good as ever!

I'm so glad he got his HEA!Dankyo and Sofia embark on an adventure as he accompanies her on a mission to solve a puzzle.  Their interactions are scorching, Dankyo commands her submission in such a way that she can't help but submit.  Her curiosity and vulnerability as well as light humor make him yearn for more than their temporary arrangement.I've only read a handful of steampunk stories and Cari's is a definite read.  She handles BDSM amazingly, while being hot and steamy also very sensual and raw.  The characters are brought to life in vivid descriptions, seeing them fall in love was truly a wonderful experience.Book provided by author for an honest review.

$review_text.: First Line: Katina's eyes locked on the straight-back chair she had wedged under the doorknob.Katina Salvo has come a long way from her abusive childhood. The reclusive Native American singer/songwriter's music sells very well, even though she's never made a personal appearance or given a concert. Her manager feels that it's time to change all that and have Katina move another step up the ladder, so a concert is booked in a small North Carolina theater where Deputy Steven Hawk will be put in charge of the singer's security.Something goes terribly wrong at the concert, and Katina and Hawk are attacked. No one is quite sure of the assailant's identity, so the singer and the deputy regroup in familiar territory for Katina: the Taos Pueblo Indian Reservation in New Mexico. Hawk is determined to find this mysterious attacker before he can get close enough to kill the talented young woman.Snare was so good that I'm going to have to get my hands on a copy of Ledford's first book in the series, Staccato. The pacing kept the story moving at a fast clip, and the plot-- after giving readers two viable suspects-- kept me trying to guess the right one. (I guessed wrong, by the way.)Ledford has created a compelling story where the main characters are all members of minorities. (I love it when the Lone Ranger doesn't show up and the day is saved anyway.) She's also very adept at adding small details that can pack a big emotional punch-- as when the very young Katina is hiding in her bedroom and marking time on her Hello Kitty alarm clock.The scenes revolving around the concert-- both doublechecking the security set-up, the concert itself, and the near-riot and attack-- moved lightning quick, were frightening, and felt almost as though I were watching a video. Everything was crystal clear in my mind's eye. Also much appreciated were the details of Taos Pueblo life and culture during the scenes taking place in New Mexico.All in all, I found Snare to be a very good read, and I'm hoping Deputy Hawk has a good long run of many books to come.

The love between Laney and Chance was so cute and filled with love and sex hahaha. The story telling was very well done for a first novel. What I love the most was Laney's love for her children. You felt that love that oozed out of her for her kids. Almost makes me feel the love the author has for her very own.

This elegant deck brings that wisdom and guidance straight to you.Featuring thirty-six stunning renaissance styled illustrations of artist Warren Maddill, these card are rich in symbology, featuring such well-known angels as: Metatron, Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel; as well as introducing us to The Angel of Spiritual Growth, The Angel of Children, The Angel of Creativity and many, many more.The profiles given in the companion book are knowledgeable, flowing and easy to understand. They give a deeper meaning to the card readings without forcing you to discard you the messages your intuition receives during the reading itself.Also within the book are instructions on three types of reading styles. Ambika gives information on single card reading, a Yin/Yang spread and a three-card (past, present, future) spread. She also encourages the readers to develop their own methods.The cards serve as a wonderful means for connecting to the higher powers, and from my experience are very accurate, and hearing what information and advice they have for you.

$REVIEW.: Book Review by Chris for Book SakeDelilah Dirk is a true adventure tale. There isn't a moment without some action, humor, camaraderie, or a mixture of all of the above. The story, world, and characters are just so full of life. They really just come to life.The story itself isn't an epic. The world isn't going to end. There isn't a power mad wizard trying to take the world over. But that is okay because there's Delilah, her Turkish lieutenant and their wild and entertaining adventures.Speaking of the duo it is great to read a story with a female and male lead character and they don't have to be romantically involved. Who knows, maybe one day they will, but right now they are just friends and what a wonderful friendship. Their relationship is so well written and hilarious.There are hardly any faults with this book. If anything I would say it is a kid friendly book, but there are a couple of instances that may not be for all kids. There is some sword stabbing and little light cursing. But no blood really or anything worse then you'd hear on network television.If you are a fan of exotic adventures or high flying tales, this book will entertain you. If you are not a fan of that stuff, what the heck?Book Review by Jessica for Book SakeI read this book at Chris's insistence. He knows what I like and what I don't and in the world of graphic novels, he is King at Book Sake. So of course I liked it. After the first chapter I made a comment to him that it's Buffy-esque and he immediately knew what I meant. The characters have a witty banter, well mostly Deliliah is Buffy-esque. Her lines have that Joss Whedon feel, which I adore. The characters are interesting and unlikely companions, which makes it work all the more.While I felt that not a lot happened, I often feel that way about graphic novels because I read more for the story than for the artwork. Speaking of artwork though, there was nothing distracting about it for me, it didn't take away from the storyline, but did add to it with the facial expressions and body language of the characters. I could imagine them as characters in a TV show or movie - the sighs audible in every way.I will continue on with the series and see what is to come of this adventure tale. I'm sure Tony Cliff has more snark up his sleeve!Book Received: For free from publisher in exchange for an honest review

Her sister Emma becomes a member of the church and gets married.  This has Lizzie questioning love, life and faith.  Since Lizzie is a little older in this book than in Running Around (And Such), this book focuses on becoming a young woman.  She questions God's will, the meaning of scriptures and the true meaning of love.I love the attention to details that Ms. Byler provided in this book.  She described the wedding and Amish customs with precise details.  I think I have learned more about the Amish community by reading her books.  I am looking forward to reading the third and final book in this series called Big Decisions which is scheduled to be released in March 2011.A special thanks to FSB Media for allowing me to review this book before it is released!

$review_text.: (NOTE: My first review was negative. See the end for the original review.)The book is an excellent read. It went by really fast. I believe it's the first genuine insider's look at AC/DC, and it's from a band member who was there during the climb to the top. I recommend it to any fan of rock-n-roll and especially AC/DC.The original review I wrote is below. All of those problems are gone with my second purchase. I think it was just one of those strange technology glitches. The ebook is flawless on the second try. No problems. I have a Kindle, plus the Kindle app for Android, and the book reads perfectly on both devices now.Original review:There's a lot of missing text in the electronic edition of this book, which I bought a few days ago. I'm at the 21% mark and have found five instances of missing text so far. It's unreadable.I just returned the book and received a full refund in about 15 seconds. Not bad at all! I checked "defective content" for the reason. So, that menu selection and this review are the only ways Amazon has of knowing there's a problem with the electronic edition. I hope they resolve the issue and let me know about it, because I'd buy this book again in a heartbeat.Based on the text I was able to read, the book is excellent. Any AC/DC fan would love this book. Too bad I can't read it.Despite this problem, I make no condemnation of Amazon or the ebook system. I like both, and have had excellent service all around. Amazon sells thousands of products, possibly millions, and there's bound to be a lemon lurking here and there.

$REVIEW.: Act Like You Love Me was a good example on how people can change over time.  In high school Sawyer was the self-absorbed jock and Brynn was a weird theater geek.  You also learn about other people (especially bullies) from their high school who have changed for the better.One of the things I liked about Act Like You Love Me is when it switches POV's you feel that person's POV.  At first you hated Sawyer when you read from Brynn's POV because she hated him, and when you read Sawyer's POV you thought Brynn was a brat and didn't like her.  It also made you sympathize with whoever's POV you were reading.  I don't think I've ever read a book that did that, but as the book goes on their view on each other change so it's not as dramatic of a switch.  Anyways, it was a nice change to read.One thing I hated about the book was I kept reading "Brynn" as "Bryan", so I'd be really confused as to who this new Bryan character was till I reread the sentence.  It wasn't really a big deal, I just never realized how much reading the name Brynn could mess me up. ;)

Topics discussed inside this book include the proper lens, understanding the importance of light (or the lack thereof) and shutter speed among a host of others.

$REVIEW.: I loved this sweet novella
A growly alpha is all fine and well, but I love those hesitant beta heroes

Fletcher was adorable and sweet and so scared that Lexie would reject him if she knew how he really felt


Meanwhile, Lexie was great - at first I was afraid she would be one of those klutzy, incompetent TSTL types, but she wasn't at all that way

The author did a great job of showing that she was a strong, smart woman in spite of the way others often underestimated her

I also appreciated that this was a complete story even with the shorter length

The characterization was strong, and there was plenty of plot
I highly recommend this.

$REVIEW.: In this relatively readable but ethically inexcusable work, Mr


Zizek  finally does what many of his readers have expected him to do: he outs himself as a communist

The writing was on the, er, "wall", of course, after some of his recent books and especially after he edited one of Lenin's works


Here he's forthright in proffering what he believes would be best for humanity, what social movement he wishes would sweep across the planet
No anodyne or meliorist Scandinavian-style social democratic half-measures for him! He wants the grand-daddy of them all, the Big C: communism.What is most disturbing is that he weds his musings on the need for communist uprisings and action, with an emphasis on -- as he says a number of times -- the "Pauline" (read: universal) nature of ethics

The upshot is that communism isn't just an option that, say, Peruvians in a jungle camp, or Nepalese militants, or a flat of Bologna mates who want to live as anarchists to try it out, or radicals in Christiania (Copenhagen), or whomever, can avail themselves of, on a local scale


No, communism must be universalized and universalizable

If it is not everywhere, then it is nowhere, and that won't do

(This explains his quasi-Christian animosity towards the relativistic postmodernists: his Truth will mean nothing if it is not True in every possible situation, and True for everyone.) Naturally, as with communism 1.0, those who don't believe will presumably need to be "educated." (Does that mean there will be education camps with Lacan on the reading list?)Problems abound
For example he quotes John Gray -- a most interesting thinker, indeed a commendably hard-to-categorize thinker -- on a number of occasions


But has he really read Gray's work, or Isaiah Berlin's for that matter? Has he learned nothing from Gray's many compelling essays, written from the centre-right, the centre and the centre-left, over many years? If Gray's thought can be distilled, it is to this: that utopian thinking (whether communist, central-planning, top-down, socialist, neoconservative or efficient market fundamentalist) is mistaken precisely because it is universal, and rides roughshod over pluralistic, local and practical/practice-based, organically evolved alternatives


Zizek weighs up communist totalitarianism (for the horrors of which, see e.g

Caplan's Museum of Communism, online) vs

the merits of piece-meal, muddling, pluralistic social (mini-)engineering, and plumps for the former


To be sure, this is communism shorn of its immutable laws of history talk, and the usual communist messianism is muted by an unspoken acknowledgement that hundreds of millions went to their deaths in a myriad of ways (all miserable) because radicals wished to instantiate some form or other of collectivist utopia.Overall, for all of the "knowing", sophisticated prose, the references and the name-dropping, this is almost ridiculously simplistic thinking, designed for the undergrad minds who presumably purchase the vast majority of the books Mr

Zizek's churns out with such regularity

Policy options aren't brought up and discussed seriously, opposing views (or should I say the views of "dissenters"?) are given short shift, and of course there little discussion of civil society, let alone -- most crucially, and damningly -- what communism 2.0 would even remotely look like, practically speaking (would there be parliaments? workers councils? any private property? parental input into school curricula? elections?)...

$review_text.: This was a short and cute story.  It is considered a historical romance, clean PG rating.  The story was about Tom, and his inability to find himself a girl because he was just so clumsy and ackward around them.  Tom soon becomes the joke of the town, including his younger brothers.  Jessica was the girl everyone loved, especially mother-in-laws because she would agree to everything and never complain.  She was engaged to Peter, who was completely a momma's boy.During a dance, Tom is doing his usual, getting rejected by all the girls, except Jessica felt bad for him and thought that perhaps she could help him overcome his clumsiness and make him datable.  Their first dance together was a complete disaster, making Jessica wonder if Tom was really a lost cause.  After their incident, they start seeing each other more often under different situations.  Story is very predictable, yet I still found it entertaining, light and easy to read.  Can't complain too much, it was free afterall!

$review_text.: The thing that makes The Hambledown Dream so special is the author's clear love of music and classical guitar.  He incorporates this love into a tale of love, life, and redemption as Denny, an Australian architect who loves to play the guitar, finds himself "reborn" in Andy, a Chicago drug addict who also loves to play the guitar.  As Andy battles to clean himself up and make something of his life, he is haunted by images of Australia and of Sonya, Denny's fiance.  When presented with an opportunity to travel to Australia as part of a music festival, Andy finally has a chance to find Sonya and put his demons to rest.  Although The Hambledown Dream is a compelling story of redemption, Dean Mayes description of the music, that serves as Andy's ultimate salvation, truly makes The Hambledown Dream a special read.  I found myself feeling the music, almost as much as Andy did.  I loved this book and can't wait to read more of Mr. Mayes's work.

$REVIEW.: Simply put, I loved this book.  It delivered everything I'm looking for in an erotic romance: unique and engaging characters, an engrossing storyline and some very delicious sex that will leave you squirming in your seat.  We're first introduced to Indigo who is a rather unconventional heroine.  She's a curvy fetish model and culinary student with brilliant tattoos and blue-streaked hair.  Indigo is hired last minute to be a sushi model (a living, breathing food display platter!) for the very famous and talented Chef Banner Faust.  Indigo is a fangirl of Banner's so she is both nervous and ecstatic to work with him.Banner has devoted his life to becoming a top chef, but his personal relationships have suffered for it.  Banner is a Dom in the Miami BDSM scene, though his need to find his perfect submissive has been pushed to the back burner, until he meets Indigo.  Banner senses a submissive nature in Indigo that he longs to explore.  He offers her a 3-day "trial" period to experience the pleasures of dominance and submission.  A painful past has caused Indigo to build a tough, protective barrier around her true self to avoid being hurt again.  Banner's challenge will be to break through those walls and show her how liberating the act of submission can be.Fallon Blake is one of my tip-top favorite new-to-me authors I've discovered this year.  I read her first book This Side of Heaven (an erotic paranormal romance) a few months ago, and I couldn't wait to see what she had in store for us next.  Wrapped Around Your Finger was worth the wait!  She has a very pleasant writing style, and her words flow together effortlessly.  The characters are written so that the reader gets to know them right away.  Indigo and Banner are both multidimensional and realistic, and they're believable as a couple.So, what about the BDSM and sex?  Scrumptious would be a good description considering this is culinary erotica!  What can I say except that Banner is my kind of Dom.  He's not into rigorous D/s protocol, though he doesn't mind Indigo calling him Sir.  He's into gaining her trust and taking control so they both will have maximum pleasure (not to mention he's also quite charming and, of course, he's a great cook.)  He has a very naughty use for ginger which is actually somewhat common in BDSM, though I've never seen it practiced in an erotic story.  Bravo to the author for making something I was a bit scared of very erotic!  Wrapped Around Your Fingers will appeal to fans of erotic romance and BDSM.  Highly recommended!SOURCE: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: Digesting an entire story and reproducing it in three lines is an art form


To have had it your daily paper was a privilege denied to all of us


Feneon could make the most mundane news item into a fascinating gem


He could communicate angles with extraordinarily efficient use of words


He was the Al Hirschfeld of news
Like Hirschfeld, Feneon's news items are tinged with humor:Brandy he thought

Actually it was carbolic acid.Thus Philibert Faroux, of Noroy, Oise, outlivedhis spree by a mere two hours.If you read this book while imagining the nationwide roundup page in USA Today, you will mourn the death of creativity


Journalism today is so dry and careful, so politically correct, as to be completely disposable and avoidable

Try this item, one of series describing the ongoing battle to get crucifixes out of classrooms in 1906:Two mayors in the Somme were determinedto restore to classroom walls the imageof divine torture
The prefect suspendedthose mayors.And let me leave you with one last gem that could also never appear in an American paper today:The name of a man arrested in Blainvilleas a spy: Tourdias

His age: 24

Hisprofession: traveling salesman of bandagesand medicine.Truly a novel, an elevator pitch for a Hollywood thriller

Leaves you asking questions, like nothing in the papers today
And that's the whole point, isn't it? Leave them asking for more!

$review_text.: This is the second of the "Entry Point" novellas to be released for the Simon Vector universe.  If you have not previously read "Simon Vector" or "Correction" this is another good place to enter into this intriguing new literary universe.  To enjoy the story you are not required to read the preceding works, but of course, it does help to know what's going on.  It is an experience comparable to viewing an unfinished tapestry or peering through a broken kaleidoscope. Each new work in the series of books gives us, the readers, a glimpse of the pattern of the whole.  Each time we lift the cover of one of these stories new characters are introduced and we are exposed to more elements of the political and societal pressures that force the choices the protagonists of each story make.As "Correction" was the most recent story I had read in this universe it's brutal flavor remained on my palate as I began reading this work.  This sensation was also enhanced as several of the characters have cross-over scenes between the two stories.  However, the brutal flavor of "Correction" was washed away as I bit into the bloody pulpy meat of Corruption.  Make no mistake, "Corruption" is a pulp adventure along the pattern of the old Penny-Dreadful westerns or hard-boiled detective novels. In "Corruption" we are formally introduced to Marshal Boothe, who may be the first actual hero we have in the Simon Vector stories. And considering the nature of these books his eventual destination on the prison planet of Alpha Draconis seems pre-ordained.  There is less jumping around in time in this narrative than there was in "Correction," but there is still a bit, so the reader is counseled to pay attention to the boldfaced "Before" and "Now" alerts that sometimes appear at the beginning of a chapter.  Otherwise they might, as I did, get confused about if they are still in an extended flashback or not.If you are a fan of Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels or of the 2005 film, Marshal Boothe's story does have some similarities to the "Hartigan" storyline portrayed by Bruce Willis, adapted from "That Yellow Bastard."  However, when you're working in the pulp genre, similarities to preceding works are inevitable and I'll leave it to TV Tropes to dissect the similarities and differences.  There is something comforting about going into a work and finding a character type that you are already familiar with from the past, it's a bit like coming home.If you are a fan of sci-fi and adventure stories I do recommend giving "Corruption: A Marshal Boothe Tale of Justice" a try, a digital copy is only $.99 on Amazon and you're sure to get at least a couple of hours of entertainment from it.  As for me, I'll be waiting for the next two Entry Points to drop so that I can return to this universe and find out more about what the heck was going on in Simon Vector.

I bought the love story between William and Bryn 100%. It was sweet, passionate, and heartbreaking all at the same time. To love someone so completely and believe that you will never get to be with them completely is just heartbreaking.The characters were terrific in this book. I felt as if I knew them all by the end. I wanted to beat John to death, give Cora a huge hug, and smack Charles and Nathanial for not believing in William. If he is supposed to be the leader of the family, why do they not trust his judgement on this one issue that is more important to him than any other? I almost cried for William in the screen in the Council Chambers..having to go through the same torture all over again.Anyway, I really enjoyed this book. There were so grammatical errors, but that isn't all that important to me as long as I can follow the story. This story is worth the purchase. I don't think many will be disappointed

$REVIEW.: I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.3.5 StarsBright City Lights is a paranormal/murder mystery story

 Rabb is an alpha shifter who owns a bar in Bright City

 He does not follow typical traditions, preferring living in the city rather than open spaces
 Brant has been the mayor of Bright City for a decade
 He is determined to remove shifters from the city in order to protect his secret

 These two have a scorching history and are forced to work together to solve a sting of shifter murders

 Will their history prevent them from solving the murders, will it cause Brant&#8217;s secret to be discovered or will these two come together burning hotter than before?This book was a fun read
 It kept my attention and the mystery behind the murders was intriguing


 The characters were interesting

 Rabb is a total alpha, but he has a warm heart especially when it comes to Brant

 He wants nothing more than for Brant to be happy

 Brant is a torture soul

 He makes hard choices to protect the ones he loves, but at a huge cost to himself
 The side characters are nicely developed


 I am eager to hear more about their stories


 For fans of paranormal romances, this is a sweet story involving shifters and vampires.I wish Ms

Sands would have spent some time with the world building
 I got the impression humans didn&#8217;t know about paranormals at one point, then it appeared humans did know about them


 Also, I wish the book was a little longer

 The story felt a little rushed and underdeveloped


 This is the first book in the series, so these issues might be corrected with the other books come out


 The only other issue I had was the ending


 It was very abrupt

 I actually looked at my kindle in disbelief that it was over

 You do get some closure, but the ending definitely leaves you wanting to read the next book.Overall a fun and entertaining read
 I would absolutely read other books in this series.

Three mysterious people from some shady governement department are nosing around Leesa's dorm and they are after anything supernatural. Luckily Leesa is not on her own to deal with the new threat.The epilogue promised more trouble coming in the next book, so I hope I won't have to wait too long for it.

The seduction scenes are overly long drawn out with highly overblown poetically styled descriptive verbiage.  Then turns in a seduction scene worthy of a well trained an highly talented prostitute. The actions description runs on so long it gets booring.No I don't recommend this book, I also won't buy the next book in this series.

$REVIEW.: Originally posted at: [...]Sarah Munro goes back to the old family homestead in the still semi-untamed, hot and humid world of New South Wales, Australia. She leaves behind both her fiance' and her current, and enormously successful, life in Sydney.Her visit brings her past too much into focus: her past and her first love. From her view, we find Ethan Wade as a tough Aussie outdoorsman who knows what he wants and is set on having it. We have to question his real motives - and Sarah has to stop running from all she has tried to leave behind before they can even begin to sort things out.We get to know Ethan from his own perspective; we develop a much closer understanding of his thoughts - and indeed, meeting Sarah again is shockingly emotional for him.There's a measure of suspense right from the very start. Ms. Brandyn doesn't just give away Sarah's past mistake, or perhaps, betrayal. Nor does she let us guess the real direction of the storyline; the best part of this is that secrets are revealed in a very unpredictable way.The blue mountains unfold as the backdrop or the lonely cattle station in the scrub brush, dry withered grasses struggling to survive. We readers feel completely inundated with the place, from sights to scents, the outback comes alive. The community, old friendships, and rural location all give us a sense that Sarah is far from the place and person she has become. And is that what she wanted? We have to wonder...did she just take up the life she found when she ran away from that one mistake? Sarah's anxiety about disclosure is actually quite secondary to her grief at that long-ago decision. And as the secrets come out, so too do the possible entanglements.Ms. Brandyn writes beautifully of this exotic locale, in fact her descriptions would give even area residents a new perspective on their home. Descriptions are never overdone either - a line here or there, interspersed, work to give us an overview that we are hardly aware is building in our minds. Not so our main character's internal monologue, which occasionally does drag drearily on...but always clarifies the past.Ethan, the Aussie cowboy, tough as he is, is every girl's dream, but somehow a little bit more, too. There are definitely surprises in store. Sarah is not the only one with a secret.Wonderfully evocative and engaging, Heat in the Outback should be on everyone's summer reading list.

$review_text.: Pros:  This is an interesting take on yoga.  Mr. Stiles has a clear love for his profession, his students and yoga.  I agree with the premise that a regular yoga practice will effect the structure of your body.  This is good news for someone like me with an tilted pelvis, also for people with curved backs or knock-knees etc.  There are very detailed chapters on how to measure your own strength and flexibility.  He invites the reader to consider what their goal/intention is in their personal yoga practice. For example some people would like better posture, others more strength, others want focus or calm.  No problems there, this is all useful information, related in an engaging format.Cons: I felt the book was priced over average, considering that some of the pages were blank - i.e. blank forms for you to fill in, and some of the pages were duplicate. He shows the same sequence over again in different chapters in order to cover different aspects.While this is an excellent sequence, I don't agree that it is the only sequence you'll ever need.

$review_text.: I don't think that C.D. Reiss can write a character that I don't like, well except maybe Jessica from S.o.S., I was not a fan of her.  In The Songs of Perdition series we are introduced to a few more Drazens, with Fiona front and center.Fiona is a rich party girl that doesn't care what people have to say about her. She is looking for a good time and if you can provide it for her, she is yours.  The Drazen kids are out of control, so their every move is plastered on tv, including the incident that landed Fiona in a mental institution.Fiona's memory of the incident is fuzzy to say the least.  She remembers bits and pieces of the evening, but not enough to explain what happened and get out.  Elliott Chapman is the Doctor at the hospital assigned to help Fiona sort things out.Elliott is another story.  There is something up with him and I hope he sticks around for Fiona's sake.Songs of Perdition is pure C.D. Reiss and I loved every page!

$review_text.: This is a novel approach to improving one's competitive chess skills

Taking a page from sports like basketball and soccer, it proposes a concentrated series of repetitious drills using various chess motifs involving each piece in turn, and also involving both tactical and strategic aspects of the game.The author, starting with the premise that there is a difference between "chess ability" and "chess knowledge," and that this difference shows up most often among club players as early blunders and tactical weaknesses, claims that the techniques introduced here improved his personal chess rating by 700 points in two years - that is, that it moved him from a class "D" player (1200) to international master level (1900).After reading the book, I have my doubts about the claimed improvements
But I could be wrong because the drills do rely on a kind of "board mind/muscle memory" training which indeed could well protect against blunders, a major problem with club players

And thus could reasonably give a modest player a "leg up" on automatic visualization of the board.However, early blunders is not even halve the problem with weak chess playing


Arguably more important is being able to contend with those who have both superior chess knowledge AND superior chess ability -- sometimes only for the moment

Skill, after all is not a random variable left up to chance
These days, "getting out of the opening" even against average players (and all of the chess machines) requires more than just a minimum knowledge of basic opening strategies.My own solution to this problem is to play at least three practice games with a highly rated chess computer, before playing a fourth game with a human under rigorous competition rules


In the practice games, I allow myself one "blunder take back," but under competition rules, none are allowed

Then I ratchet up the level of the machine until it takes clear overall improvements to beat it

I also, try to replay all games from memory, giving special and concentrated attention to situations that caused repeated blunders
The same weaknesses invariably will keep showing up until the missed concept comes well within one's range of intuitive vision.In my view, repetition is good only when it is directed at the weakness at hand

Remember the old saw "that practice makes perfect, but only perfect practice makes perfect?" I think that rule applies here


But again I could be wrong, so I need to test the author's thesis.With my technique, I have seen slow, but steady improvements in both tactical and strategic (or positional) play, as well as in my FIDE score (which over the years has varied from 1150-1760)
And importantly, also in my confidence in match play! On a good day, I can consistently beat a 1400 player.I am going to give the author's technique a try, but on a more accelerated time schedule

Two years is a long time at age 70


 Three Stars

$review_text.: This book both teaches, models, and facilitates letting go. Just reading it opens new ways to become more free.The book opens with a freewheeling inventory of spiritual seeking and the resultant bewilderment. There's nothing like it in all Hawkins' work for fun and zaniness.Then the book's solution is presented through a brilliant analysis titled the Anatomy of Emotions. This is the master key to Hawkins' work of bringing emotional peace to humanity. David discovers five strategies for dealing with emotions and shows unexpected ways to using these five strategies.Particularly empowering is the discussion of denial of surrender, which explains why the mechanism of denial whereby many former students of Dr Hawkins can "forget" the miraculous healings they experienced as a result of the work; this helps create compassion for people's baffling tendency to give false explanations for having surrendered through the enlightened Presence of a spiritual teacher.Two categories of letting go are letting go of negative emotions and letting go of resisting positive emotions:Two thirds of the book evokes and teases out these two categories experientially. Each of these chapters open with a mini inventory of similar words, which just by reading through surfaces new options and choices, new ways to get free. Rather than an intellectual or therapeutic approach, here we have crisp clinical observations, flashes of wit (Hawkins is the George Carlin of Consciousness), and recontextualizations that bring release. Subjects include love, sex, money, work, sales, and happiness.The last third of the book treats specifics and relies on experience with the previous two thirds of the book. A miraculous and simple way to solve problems well and make the right decisions through letting go is shared.The last two chapters concern letting go of illness and letting go of the small self or ego/mind. They are for the healer and spiritual student in us all.Although David Hawkins died in late 2012, I hope this will not be the last of his manuscripts Veritas publish. He was a kind man and he is missed. In addition, work so useful and caring will find a lively and appreciative audience. Five stars from a completely happy customer.

I loved the entire book but especially the parts where baby Keely is brought home from the hospital, Carolyn has to leave her children in care of Carson to attend her aunt's funeral and Carolyn disapproves her husband's idea of retirement. There is an eternal quality of the love between Carson and Carolyn.Ms. Lorelei James, are you wrapping up this incredible series with this book? Then I would say it is a fitting finale.

$REVIEW.: Have you ever wondered what would happen if the world was given all the happy they could stand and then were given more? Can you imagine the chaos that would occur? If you were one of the happy ones you really wouldn't care you'd just want more or anything that made you happy. Luke Ahearn's "Euphoria-Z" explores what happens when the world really gets happy and stays there. Everything you know grinds to a halt as the happy waves keep waxing over the population with people overdoing everything from eating to sex and back again.It really gets scary when it not only happens in cities like Los Angeles -- you expect some craziness there -- but how about conservative London or on the streets of Anytown USA? Happy is the watchword and overdoing it is the corollary. You know a germ of some kind caused it -- some whit named it "Euphoria-Z" -- but no one really knows where it originated. Did terrorists or maybe the government do it intentionally? How about a germ that mutated and grew exponentially flooding the skies with its lethally happy results? Or was it a spore that changed and did the same things? You do know the outcome -- happy, hedonistic people doing the immoral, amoral and anything in between. Eventually, though, the happy mutates and people who were still happy, also needed to eat anything. -- you, your cat or dog, your Great-Aunt Ethel. At least, they would be eaten with a smile as the happy people were just doing their happy bit for society.When the mutation happens people look and act exactly like zombies and, you know something, they just can't get enough to eat and they can't have enough hedonism to keep them happy all the time, even if they are dragging arms and legs around. At this time, people act exactly like zombies. They not only want to be happy but they want you, too, and they'll have their happy and if eating you will help keep them happy, the chances are good you may be a snack for a very interesting person or group of people. That is, if you have the disease full on. If not and you have to avoid the happy people you need a good claw hammer, cricket or baseball bat or a good 9 iron and then you have to make sure it's a headshot the first time because if they lose an arm or leg, it doesn't matter as they just keep coming.In the hands of skillful author Luke Ahearn. The leaders are the last people you would expect to be heroes. The usual heroes are typically the brooding sheriff with the slightly questionable past who comes to town and redeems himself or the long-time town leader whose leadership qualities are known to all and to whom people naturally turn. The funny thing about the town leader is that he usually turns out to be the first out of town or who tries to find the deepest cellar, locks it and tries to save himself.The real leaders are those you would never expect: the town slacker, a biker and other  people caught in an unwinnable situation. In Ahearn's capable hands the heroes - as well as the bad buys -- come to life. As a reader, you learn to care for them - well maybe not for Banjo the bad biker - as you press on through an excellent work.Who are the leaders in Ahearn's "Euphoria-Z?" There is the mild and slightly slackerish Cooper, for example. He is the last person you'd expect to be a hero. On the other side, Banjo the killer biker and friends are just bad hombres and Ahearn makes them live on.That, I think, is the mark of an excellent writer. He snookers you into a book that has you pulling an all-nighter just to find out what happens to the good guys and the bad guys and the happy guys.The great thing about his skill is that you never know you've been pulled in as completely. (This was another one that had me reading when the sun went down and when it came up again, I was still reading. That, to me, is the mark of an exciting, skillful writer. I've been doing this a long time -- writing, not being a zombie -- and I sometimes stand in awe of a writer who makes it look effortless to write so well.)"Euphoria-Z" not only features fresh writing, it is full of surprises; you just have to keep reading to find out what happens next. This is where Ahearn reaches his stride. He puts together a group of people who have to survive. They were in the wrong places at the wrong times even as the rest of the world reached for its happy. They are forced to live and do things they never thought they would do.For example, if you are being run down by zombies and you happen to have a loaded gun, it doesn't make much sense to sit in Zen-like position, saying: "Come let us reason together." Wrong move because all it makes you is zombie kibble. Instead, you whip the bad boy out of its holster or wherever you stowed it and start getting those happy, but hungry zombies with headshots, the only way to do them in.Leaders emerge who you never thought would be leaders. Of course, there's obligatory cop, Dale, in the story who keeps things together and keeps his charges save. He's undercover and people thought he was someone else, but no he's the police authority figure.Then, there's Cooper, brilliant, but slightly out of the mainstream, who steps in to take up the challenge. Dale, Cooper and Ron and a couple of women, Ana and Wendy, lead the anti-happy zombie effort. Ahearn's characterization is first rate and he knows that people will support those who offer them protection, often turning on their former "friends." For example Banjo, an outlaw biker who just likes to hurt people, finds his friends turning on him and supporting the good guys. All Banjo wants to do is more and more bad stuff that has nothing to do with their safety.Each character is fully developed and has a front story and an equally good back-story so you feel you've known these people for years. Ahearn has taken his time to make the characters real and he grabs you and pulls you into his work. It's a great read that leaves you more than a little scared (okay so I looked under the bed) and wanting more.

$REVIEW.: I have trouble rating this book.  I read through almost every book, even if it leaves me somewhat cold.  However, I came close to putting this one down.  When I read the first hundred pages, I really felt like they could have been condensed into about 25 pages.  I'm still not convinced that this should be the case.  However, after working through the beginning, the plot took off and I became much more interested in the book.  Behind the story are many questions that the authors challenges us to ponder.  Can we truly change who we are over time?  What should the role of the church be?  How can children be treated and understood when they try to deal with the vagrancies of life?  Pondering these questions makes the book a very worthy read.  I just wish that the beginning had been a bit more engaging.

$REVIEW.: I picked this book to read largely because the contents of the book contain a lot of chocolate.  However, the book was not as good as eating a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Kind of disappointing.But I pursued the end of the novel.  It got better with time, but still . . . it took WAY TO LONG for the story to engage with my imagination.Perhaps it was because main character , Carly, is older than myself?  Divorced?  I'm not sure . . . but it was hard to connect with this character.  She didn't seem quite believable.I most likely would NOT purchase this book nor would I check it out from the library.  Sorry!I received this book through BookSneeze.  I was not paid for this post nor do I have to return the novel.

$review_text.: Glenn Reynolds writes a crisp, thought-provoking,  critique of the debt bubble in higher education. He describes it, defines it and offers prescriptions for the clueless student - adrift in post high school,  dreamland America -  at the same time challenging the intellectual poobahs of the university set in their outmoded, static and self protective thinking.  One may not like what he writes but one can not but be impressed by a fluid writing style and his forward approach to a major issue festering in our educational obsessed society and this country's need to reconsider our fixation on college and its escalating financial costs.

$REVIEW.: What a relief this ebook was for me


I have been dealing with acne for a really long time and was getting quite fed up! I knew I had to make some lifestyle changes to help it, but didn't know where to start

This ebook gave some great info about dietary changes and natural remedies, like herbs, that can help with acne


I've implemented some changes to make myself healthier overall, and my skin is finally starting to look a little clearer
I would recommend this ebook for anyone that is having trouble with persistent acne.

It's those type of books that you just one click without reading what the story is about. And that's what you should do....buy it without hesitation, you won't be disappointed. She brought the characters to life from book 1, and you can't help but fall in love with them all and I love the fact she brings back the characters from the recent series to the next book.

$REVIEW.: Hannah is happy to escape the pressures of her everyday life, especially after her father's drug overdose. She is opting to spend the summer with her Aunt instead of going to Paris with her mother. Hannah is nearly suffocating from the expectations and rules of her parents. She doesn't expect to meet someone who will help her break free of those rules. Can Hannah find a new beginning for herself and set her own rules?What I Liked:*I picked this one up expecting a light, fluffy, summery romance, but what I got was a book all about finding yourself and learning to let go of the past. While I was a tiny bit disappointed that this wasn't all feel good and easy reading, I was happy to see that it tackled some important issues such as: drug and alcohol abuse, loss, growing up, deciding your own future and healing. This book doesn't stray too far into the overly dramatic and gut wrenching fare that is so popular right now. I think this towed the line perfectly as it carried a nice balance between dramatic and fun. If you are a fan of the popular New Adult books, but want something that won't tear your heart out, this would be a good pick.*The romance in this one is slow and subtle. Two people meet, and the first meeting isn't exactly all sparkles and butterflies, neither is the second. Over time, Hannah ends up forming a friendship with Jude, a troubled young man who just recently lost in brother in Afghanistan. The pair are complete opposites, Hannah is the good girl, straight A student who adheres to a set of complex rules. Jude is a bit of a bad boy and a rebel, especially since the death of his brother. Over the summer, a shirt flapping from a tree, a broken truck, and a mountain will bring the two together and through it all they form a strong friendship that eventually turns into something a bit more. This romance builds very slowly, and in fact it takes the entire book to get there, but I am a fan of romances that take their sweet time and are formed out of friendship. I thought the romance in this one was just right.*I am a fan of character growth, and this book excels at character transformation. Hannah with Jude's help, learns to let go over the ridiculously stringent rules set by her parents. During the summer, she sets her own new rules to live by, and in the process, she learns a few things about herself, finds the courage to live as she wants by not adhering to other's expectations, she lets go and even does a few things that scare her the most. Jude also transforms. He is carrying a lot of baggage from his brother's death and he has not been able to break free. His friendship with Hannah helps him to finally bury his brother and move toward a new future. I thoroughly enjoyed the maturation of both characters.*I enjoyed the writing in this one. Ms. Norris gives us plenty of sage advice on living, loving and more. There are some notable quotes and good advice to take to heart.And The Not So Much:*I felt like I was missing something as far as Hannah's backstory. She is fresh off a breakup with her boyfriend Zac. I got the impression that there was more to the story, and after I finished the book I learned that this was the companion novel to The Boyfriend Thief, and I am guessing the details of Hannah and Zac's relationship are chronicled in that book. This is not an issue because Hannah's story with Zac is in the past, but there are a couple of references to it. I am eager to go back and read The Boyfriend Thief now.*I never felt like I had a firm grasp on Aunt Lydia's character. She seems aloof and rather mysterious for most of the book. She doesn't come across as particularly warm and fuzzy, but in contrast to Hannah's parents she is a far better role model. I finally got some answer toward the end of the book, but I found that I wanted to understand her a bit more. I would like to have more details on the relationship between Lydia and Hannah's mother.*At the end, Hannah and her parents are working toward healing their relationship. I hated the way Hannah's mother treated Hannah and did not like her actions. I was hoping for a bit more admission of guilt and a little more resolution in regards to the mother daughter relationship, but it was realistic, and I know that in real life this is often the way things go.*There were a few unanswered issues for Jude. For instance: I wanted to know what happened with Jude's mother. Did he get her to clean up her act? Did they make up? Will they be okay? What really happened with the missing money from Jude's former job? I really wished that the issue with the stolen money was resolved.The Rules of You and Me is a book that will take you through the trials and tribulations of leaving behind childhood and moving toward an adult. There are always some difficult choices, and the question is will you learn to let go of the past and choose the path that will make you the most happy or will you adhere to the tight expectations of others?Favorite Quotations:&#34;Be yourself, but be the you that you could be, not the you that everyone else wants you to be.&#34;&#34;The rules you think you should follow in life aren't always the right rules for you.&#34;&#34;I know the guy your parents don't like is exactly the kind of guy you think you want. But the idea of the bad boy is sometimes better than the reality of him.&#34;&#34;I wish I had the courage to not be the person everyone expects me to be.&#34;&#34;She loves the person she wants me to be. I'm not sure that she really loves me as I am.&#34;I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own and I was not compensated for this review.Posted@Rainy Day Ramblings.

$review_text.: I LOVE this book and its presentation of the Fun of Sex. My "Lady Friend" has raised in a CONSERVATIVE home. She has enjoyed reading and learning from this book. The artwork and comicbook helps to deliver the message in a nonthreatening and fun way.  Kidder and his "team" did an excellent job of getting the information out and into the hands of people that need it.The Sex is Fun podcasts, both WITH and without Kidder, are an wonderful way of getting educated about sex, sexuality, and acceptance (to ones own comfort level). I highly recommend not only this book but also the Podcasts for everyone.  In fact I think it should be required reading for all.

$REVIEW.: At the start of this story, we see a woman afraid - Olivia - who is totally controlled by her husband, Robert. When he's away at work, he has  scheduled surveillance via online &#34;FaceTime&#34; conversations. He has steps to make certain she's exactly where she's supposed to be - always.  The Reader can see that Robert's obsessive (or even psychotic) nature exerts itself regularly in managing Olivia's total life. And as enforcement, he uses the strongly-implied threat of endangering her children (2 of which are his as well) as leverage to ensure her obedience. Observing this frightening situation, the Reader knows it will take a lot of surreptitious planning for Olivia to escape.Robert is easily able to ensure that Olivia appears to be unstable; after all, she has had a tough life: her first husband &#34;disappeared&#34; (assumed to have run off to Australia), and quite soon after, both her parents die in their sleep, due to a freakish malfunction in their home.But Olivia's guiding force is her children's safety, and it is THAT concern which keeps her reasonably grounded through all of Robert's nasty maneuvering and tricks.This story has a complex plot, with some unexpected twists and turns. Other reviewers have said that there are too many characters, but I don't think so.  I felt that the supporting characters were fine. I particularly liked her war hero friend, Sophie.  I'd enjoy Sophie in a story of her own; she has quite a feisty and brazenly brave personality.I admit to getting a bit confused as to the last part and resolution of this book, and I am still not 100% certain I've followed ALL the details, ploys and maneuvers correctly. Still, it was an intriguing and satisfying read, with enough puzzlement to keep any mystery fan entertained.

$REVIEW.: I read this compilation of the authors three books a while back and when I came across it the other day I decided that I should write a review on it because of how wonderful I found the books!  The author is part of a group who helps find homes for homeless animals and one the group asks for his help in rescuing this cat that she has observed for a while that needs care but she can't catch on her own.  He helps her catch the cat, which involves a bit of a struggle and then has to keep the cat at his apartment for a few days until they can get it looked at by the vet and then adopted out to a new family.  As soon as he gets it to his apartment, the cat disappears in the apartment and they look high and low to find it-what a humorous event.  This is the story of an independent cat and the author and the strong bond that they develop.  Beautiful story!  As a fellow cat owner, I highly recommend this book.

$REVIEW.: Rachel, 11 is biracial.  Her mother is Danish and her father is black.  Rachel spent her early childhood in Germany and did not give her rich racial heritage much thought.  She is brown in coloring and her eyes are blue.  When Rachel and her family are struck by tragedy after moving to the United States, Rachel is sent to live with her paternal grandmother in Portland, Oregon.  The neighborhood in which Rachel's grandmother lives is predominantly black.Once in Portland, Rachel is literally hung up between two sticks.  She is the target of insider bigotry. Other black kids pull her hair and accuse her of having delusions of Caucasian superiority because she does not fit a racial mold.  The age old racist claim of "thinking one is white" simply because they don't use bad grammar and street argot or act like an unflattering stereotype is one that irks me to no end.  It is one thing to adjust one's speech accordingly, but NEVER dumb down for anyone.  Using good grammar and demonstrating a good vocabulary is one good way to command respect.While I'm at it, good grammar and a large vocabulary is not exclusive to ANY race.  There is NO legitimate reason to deed over one's right to speaking the Lingua Pura to others lest they be ostracized or targeted for attack for not using street argot.  I have always believed that bad grammar and street talk is a DEPLETION of language and a form of shackling oneself to stereotypes and carry overs to a bad time in history when knowledge and learning were denied to blacks.  I feel very strongly about this and I will admit that I never liked street talk and feel that it does not speak to class.  Trying to enforce other members of a particular group to speak and act in stereotypical ways is the modern day equivalent of slavery.  Willfully choosing ignorance reflects badly on whoever makes this choice and sadly reinforces negative racial stereotypes.  I don't feel these insider racist claims and demonstrations of insider bigotry is helpful to anyone.  Again, since I do feel passionate about this, I believe that shackling oneself to an atrocious bygone era and upholding ignorance does nobody any favors.Rachel naturally feels like an outsider among her family and peers.  Because she is clearly biracial, she defies all stereotypes.  During Rachel's early years in Germany, she was simply accepted and gave no thought to the fact that she was the daughter of an interracial couple.  Most people, including those who are "identifiably" black are a mix of other races as well.  Race is a congenital condition.  Race has nothing to do with how one talks, dresses, speaks or what cultural influences they enjoy.  Sadly, people often want to label others and that confines people into places where they just don't fit.  That is ENFORCING beliefs on others and trying to categorize them in simplistic terms when people are NOT simplistic; they are complex!Durrow, who shares an Afro-Danish history with her character, Rachel has written a brilliant story.  (Model Melyssa Ford also shares an Afro-Scandinavian ancestry.)  Black, white, how about both?  Most people are!  Most people are the products of MORE than one race!  Family secrets and family dynamics as well as the place for race are discussed candidly and realistically.  Rachel is branded as "light skinned-ed" which is bad enough, but to add insult to injury her peers ride her for "talking white."  Since when is it white to use good grammar and eschew street argot?  That claim has always struck me as asinine to the nth degree.Rachel herself has some similar feelings as she cringes at her grandmother's "dialectical" speech.  Readers learn about Rachel's parents and their social attitudes.  Although part of this story takes place in the 1980s, it remains relevant and the socioracial issues resound to this day.I could identify with Rachel.  Being branded a race is bad enough, but when it is prefaced with "light skinned," it adds insult to injury.  The tacit message is that people often feel a need to define members of the black race by their skin tone.  Non-blacks who use this term raise the question of if they feel that members of the black race who are less ethnic and/or lighter in appearance are more acceptable overall.  I have never liked the term "light skinned" because I never saw the need to define or identify a person by their skin tone.  Archie Bunker comes in all colors.  Bigotry, ironically enough, is an equal opportunity form of ignorance.  Bigotry is not limited to any one group and the targets are also not limited to just one group.  Hair is a very trenchant issue among many blacks and Rachel learns this the hard way.  Other girls pull her long hair and make catty comments about her appearance.  There is also a classist assumption about hair texture:  the less ethnic one's hair is, the "better off" that person is viewed.  (Just watch Chris Rock's 2009 movieGood Hair.)  There is also the very real issue of internecine bigotry.  Often blacks who are less ethnic in appearance are targeted by other blacks who try to pigeonhole them and charge them with having delusions of superiority.  That is downright asinine!  It's all bigotry, any way you toss the dice.  How can anybody claim to know what another thinks?  And for a group with a history of being targeted based on the color of their skin and general appearance, it is damned ironic and very upsetting that there is a faction who practice this kind of insider racism replete with ridiculous racist ideas.This is a very good book that is serious, topical and in your face.  Yeah, it will evoke strong reactions in readers.  That is because it covers issues that many feel strongly about, more often than not for having lived through some of these race based targeting methods.  It is something that many people can relate to, particularly if they lived with insider bigotry.  Rachel herself grows and her view of the world naturally changes with time and maturation.  Again, this is a book that is a much needed work as these are issues that sadly still exist.Michael Jackson's 1991 hit "Black or White" is definitely the soundtrack of this book.

$REVIEW.: My mother introduced me to Susan Hayward when I was a child and I have had a love for her for a long time but really did not know much about her life.  After reading, "Brooklyn's Scarlett", I am now a rabid fan of this audacious and wonderful lady who was larger than life itself. Gene Arceri, through his artistry, has captured her essence in this most entertaining tale of life in old Hollywood.  You get the good, the bad and the raunchy, all mixed up into a neat and sometimes very saucy stew and it is a savory sauce you do not want to miss.  I found it a very light and easy read-you won't get bogged down with facts as if you are in a history class.  There are so many interesting facts inside the book that you actually want to find out more about old Hollywood.  Kudos to Mr. Arceri!  Excellent Book!

$review_text.: This had promise but fell flat


First there was way to much information on tourism, at times I felt like it was more of an information manual than a novel
Sidney wasn't the typical type to be a sleuth, other than asking around until closer to the end she really didn't do anything
I found her whiny, complaining that the ships crew wasn't doing enough when it seemed they really just didn't want to bring attention to what was going on


I couldn't figure out why Sidney was singled out in this whole thing and the twist at the end just confirmed what I thought at first


Even with all the explanations I felt like it was to much and to convenient.I felt like the plot dragged and this wasn't due to the story as much as the filler


There was just way to much un-needed information about the ship, tourism, tourist, and the places they where visiting
I think this what they talk about when they say show don't tell


It was like Sidney was talking far to much and not showing me what was going on

I couldn't get sucked into the book and carried away like I usually can with books.I think the story had a lot of potential but just slipped up on a few key things that made it unbecoming in my opinion.I received a copy from the author.

$REVIEW.: I only just recently discovered the adventures of Usagi Yojimbo, and being a swashbuckler/samurai fan I started thumbing through issue number one at my local library


It looked interesting enough to pick up
The first couple of books were fun, you can see where artist Stan Sakai borrowed from Japanese mythology and other sources, and look a few homages to some of Kurosawa's greatest films
Light entertainment

And then I picked up Grasscutter
What a story!!! Starting of with the legend of the sacred sword Grasscutter, Sakai spins an amazing quest saga


All the elements are there, love, betrayal, friendship, loyalty, honor, magic, monsters, plots, ninjas ...
A fast moving tale with surprises on almost every other page

To add even more depth to the story, Sakai cleverly weaves in characters and plot points from past adventures


You don't need to read previous Usagi Yojimbo novels to enjoy this tale, but trust me, it's well worth it!

$REVIEW.: Alex worth head of Worth luxuary goods, has been attracted to his straight laced assistant Tessa Crawford, since she started working for him just over six months ago. At thirty five he was no stranger to getting what he wanted especially where women are concerned.Tessa loves working for Alex Worth it's her dream job, and Alex is certainly dreamy. Tessa is organising his itinerary for an upcoming business trip to Europe. But Alex surprises her, he wants Tessa to go with him. Alex is determined to make Tessa his while they are away together. But upon their return she is accused of giving away company secrets to their rivals. Alex fires Tessa without a second thought. But Tessa has her own secret, but she's not telling.Okay this is a romance that is quite predictable. But that didn't stop me from enjoying this. It passed a few hours away very nicely. I liked the characters and the writers style. She certainly knows how to rack up the sexual tension. There are love scenes in this, and no they are not as explicit as some I've read. But they were well done IMO. So if you are looking for a light non taxing read to relax with. And plenty of romance thrown in then this is ideal. Alex has a couple of handsome brothers, so I expect their stories will get told as well.

Loved everything about the book from the characters, to the twists and turns, to the chapter titles, to the gods showing up at random times.

$REVIEW.: Denis Macek is a student, a student with very little money.  With the help of a friend, Denis creates a plan which will allow him one excellent meal in the best hotel in Bratislava.Friday morning, Denis, dressed in his best clothes, sits in the lobby of the Carleton Savoy hotel.  Mr. Fico is a guest at the hotel and Denis knows his room number.  Denis also knows that Mr. Fico never eats breakfast in the hotel dining room.  On this day, Denis, dressed in his best but somewhat shabby suit, watches until Mr. Fico leaves the hotel at his usual time.  Denis walks to the dining room, tells the maitre d' his name is Fico,  gives the room number and is shown to a table by a window.  The Royal Breakfast has anything and everything a person could want to eat at the start of the day.  Denis fills his plate, returns to his table, and, before he can eat a mouthful of food, he is shot by a man standing outside the hotel, shooting through the window.Commander Jana Matinova is notified that Colonel Trokan,  chief of police and Jana's mentor, wants her to take charge of what should be a low level crime.  But Trokan thinks the murder is an assassination and it took place at the city's premier hotel, the choice of the wealthy and powerful of Slovakia as well as the equally wealthy and powerful of other countries who come to do business in Bratislava.When Jana is convinced that all that can be done at the hotel has been done, she decides to visit Peter Saris, her fiance, at his office.  Peter is a prosecutor and he and Jana have been romantically involved for a year.  They have kept it quiet so they couldn't be accused of collusion on a case but they recently decided to be open about the relationship everyone knows about anyway.  Jana arrives at the Ministry of Justice building to find it surrounded by police and fire investigators.  There has been a bombing.  Peter Saris is dead, killed by a device planted into his office phone.Jana is devastated; her future gone in a second.  Trokan knows that Jana will insist on being involved in the investigation so he assigns her to Europol in The Hague.  Martin Kroslak, a fellow officer, has been assigned as the representative from Slovakia but he has disappeared.  Jana knows she must comply or lose her job and now, without Peter, all she has is her job.  She will do the job required at Europol headquarters, she will try to discover what happened to Martin Kroslak, and she will, most definitely, be doing what she must to find out who killed Peter.On the flight to the Netherlands, an elderly man sitting across the aisle begins a conversation with Jana.  He is a magician, retired now, but still enjoying whatever chance he gets to ply his art.  He tells Jana to call him "professor".  When the plane lands in Amsterdam, Jana asks to see the passenger list; she is not surprised to see that the professor has the same name as the murdered student.  The professor knows Jana is a commander in the police and he is determined to walk a step behind her, determined that he will play a part in discovering why his nephew was murdered.From the moment Jana arrives at Europol, the body count increases.  She is assigned to the same unit Martin Kroslak was in and gradually Jana becomes convinced that he is alive and deliberately avoiding the international police unit at The Hague.  Oddly, the only person Jana can trust is the professor.Magicians depend on smoke and mirrors to accomplish their ends, to confuse, to make people believe something is what it is not.  Most magicians have an apprentice to whom they teach their tricks.  But in Slovakia, the magician needs an accomplice.  Jana finds that the events that led to Peter's death began at some of the highest levels of government in more countries than Slovakia.  Magic is the art of distraction, of presenting a small lie in such a way that no one notices the deception behind the big lie.  "The accomplice aids and abets the lie".  In this story, Jana needs to discover who is the magician and who is the accomplice.This is the third book in the Commander Jana Matinova series.  The stories are becoming tighter.  Jana is always the commander in the Slovakia police.  She has yet to be more than an outline; her personality has not been revealed.  Her life has been marked by the deaths of all the people with whom she was close.  She is a Slovak, learning along with her countrymen what that means in a nation that is no longer a police state.The setting is unusual, the main character is unusual, and the stories are the similar to those in other police procedurals but with a different twist.  Genelin is worth reading.

$REVIEW.: This review, by Dr. Nicholson, has been provided courtesy of Desert Bible Institute ([...]Ready, Set, Grow is a thoughtful, well-structured book about how to not only to help increase the size of your church, but more importantly about how to create interconnectivity among your church leaders. The book has a number of strengths to it: its narrative style, the layout of the book, and the additional resources provided both in and after the book proper.Too many books on leadership read either like and instruction manual on how to assemble your son's new bicycle or like one of those endless, droning sermons that you keep checking your watch to see how much there is left. Scott Wilson largely avoids this problem by presenting information that he found useful in developing his church in a story format rather than a process paper or a moral lesson. One added benefit to this format is that it develops a sense of suspense. As readers get to know the people involved in Wilson's 3-year journey, they want to know how the various trials and confrontations worked out. You find yourself cheering for the person that you connect with and frustrated with the one that just cannot get with the program. Another advantage to the narrative structure is that it made the reading of the text smooth. Rather than the start-and-stop feel that is common to type of book, Wilson is able to maintain coherence through his use of this alternative genre.The structure to this book was also unique. While Wilson does maintain a narrative style, he frequently has recursive chapters where he goes back and looks at how certain events turned out or examines them from a different perspective. While this adds a strong element of clarity to his writing, it also made a few parts a little repetitive. This was not an overwhelming issue, but it could be a mild point of frustration for the reader. The upside to it was that the reader is extraordinarily clear on Wilson's main points. Usually after one of these recursive chapters, he had a short input for one of his team members in which they offered their take on what Wilson had just talked about. After these short interludes, they offered a few reflective questions for readers to think about. These short breaks are refreshing and help refocus the reader on the topic at had while at the same time reviewing the previous couple of chapters.Something this book has, that other less scholarly books often seem to leave out, is references to the books and materials that the team found useful. Wilson actually finishes the book not only with a list of first-rate materials but also a link to a website filled with information that could be used by a team wanting to use the model he purposes. While the book is good and offers a number of strategies and approaches that would be beneficial to any church wanting to improve their leadership, it is this list of resources and plans that will be most  useful to the pastor that plans to move forward with this strategy.Trent Nicholson, Ph.D., D.Min.Desert Bible Institute, PresidentDr. Nicholson reviews academic, Christian living, and fiction books for a variety of publishers in an array of formats. He is never paid for any of his reviews. He writes these strictly as a courtesy to his students at Desert Bible Institute and for any other readers that might find his insights valuable.

$review_text.: I was already pretty firmly ensnared in the Warner &#34;fan girl&#34; corner....even with ALL of his crazy attributes & mood swings that would give any female whiplash.The reason?The guy has more layers than a pillsbury buttermilk biscuit yo'Mafi wrote Warner to perfection here! We were already aware that he possessed the bad boy intensity, the confidence, self awareness & presence enough to fill the entirety of sector 45 alone....And now we get a glimpse behind &#34;the curtain&#34;....a peek into the private man that he is when he thinks no one is watching.And OHHHHHHHHHHHHH, it's SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!Like a lot of ladies, bad boys are too attractive, but if we peel away & see too much emotion or sensitivity, we have a tendency to plant him firmly in the &#34;little b!&iquest;&#8364;# category&#34; because suddenly the spell is ruined. Not so with Warner. Mafi succeeded in writing a character that is simultaneously terrifying (at times) and yet you still just want to give the guy a big hug.In Destroy Me we hear from Warner, Commander & Regent of Sector 45, the dialogue filling in the gaps from Shatter Me, the aftermath of Juliette's escape with Adam, following shooting Warner. We get a view inside his head that not only will blow your mind but awe you as well. We find out a lot more regarding who Warner IS & how he became this way. Also, Anderson, Warner's dip-thong father gets more &#34;screen-time&#34; in Destroy Me than any of the books or novellas in the series.A lot of questions are answered, feels experienced & I'm sure, &#34;Adam-ites&#34; converted. It's THAT GOOD.I can imagine if Juliette were to read this, after escaping Warner w/ Adam she'd be running back to Warner while kicking herself. Lots of character development with Warner, a wee teeny tiny bit w/ Delaieu & some of he entries from Juliette's diary. If you liked Shatter Me, Unravel Me, ANY of the books in the series, you'll LOVE THIS. When I read it, this was only available as an ebook, now you can buy it in paperback form, &#34;Unite Me&#34;, coupled with 2 other stories, Juliette's Diary entries & the yawn-fest that is Fracture Me, an ebook novella from Adams POV. As someone who already owned Destroy Me & Fracture Me on my ebook readers, I still bought Unite Me which features the aforementioned stories, just so I could have a copy to place next to the rest of the trilogy on my bookshelves!In my opinion, one cannot read Mafi's trilogy WITHOUT reading the novellas too, yes, even Fracture Me, as they both add details to the story as a whole & help you understand the characters better. Or in Adams case it adds to the laundry list of reasons why he's a complete D-BAG.Either way, if you like the Shatter Me series, grab Destroy Me & prepare to fall in love with Warner ALL OVER AGAIN, or the 1st time if you are 1 of the unfortunate few who are still Team Adam....5 BIG BEAUTIFUL BRIGHT SHINY TWINKLING STARS!!!!!Another win for Tahereh Mafi!!!

It becomes a mind-relief process...counting, watching, listening and learning.I was impressed with the personal touches, relating to find the transcendence of the 'spirit' via a craft that has been around for centuries. In between the little writings there are projects to motivate the mind and hands.This book was like a friend, opening the comfort in knitting.

$REVIEW.: I didn't realize when I got to review this story that it was a short story. But that being said its not a bad thing that its a short story. I would also say if your not a fan of Erotica's than this is not your story. It's fast paced and hard-core. Right off the bat you can tell both the main character's Jay and Eden both like each other but their both afraid of telling each other that they like one another. They don't want to ruin their friendship by taking it farther. Also Jay's past with his sister holds him back from telling Eden how he truly feels.Eden though is determined to show Jay that she's not all innocent and that she really likes Jay. So devises a plan to show Jay how much she likes him.By the end of the story it definitely left me wanting more and wishing that it was longer. I would definitely recommend this story to people if you like Erotica's and Role-play's.

$review_text.: Book provided by author in exchange for an honest review.This is a quick, entertaining read that features Rachel, a woman who admits that she's overweight but isn't all hung up on her image and is comfortable with herself (thank heavens for that!) and Mitch, the detective she meets after the party she's attending was raided. Sparks fly between the two, but due to misconceptions on Mitch's part he believes that Rachel is nothing more than a prostitute and gives her the choice of going to jail or.....you'll have to read the book to find out :)This was my second time reading a story by Julie Raust and just as before with her story Choosing Chase, Ms. Raust has written easy to believe characters. It's very easy to form a mental picture of Rachel, and while I didn't care for Mitch in the beginning of the story, but once he came back after that first incident, my opinion of him greatly improved. Yeah he's abrasive and might act like a jerk, but he's also fiercely protective of Rachel, so we know he's not a egotistical jackass all the time. And the sex scenes were plenty damn hot as well. My only wish for this story was that it was longer, so we could get learn more about Mitch's background. But an overall enjoyable story.

$REVIEW.: Well, keep on looking because "The Fallback Plan" definitely doesn't have one

Rather than crafting a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end, the author instead chose to offer readers a quick glance into her main character's life during the first several months after she graduated from college
Esther, the novel's main character and narrator, does not know what she wants to do with her life at the beginning of the novel, and very little changes by the time the reader finishes the last page

Though it became clear to me from reading about Esther's interactions with May that Esther should pursue a career in early childhood education, Esther doesn't seem to come to this same realization


Rather, Esther remains as aimless and apathetic at the conclusion of the novel as she was on its first page


Though "The Fallback Plan" is not a bad novel, it definitely leaves much to be desired in terms of plot and character growth.And I must add that I absolutely hated the "Littlest Panda" chapters interspersed throughout the book

After a while, I just started skipping them altogether.

$REVIEW.: Jennifer Smith has written a 30-day devotional for wives that is distinctly truthful, exhorting wives to love God and their husband's at a deeper level. "Wife After God: Drawing Closer to God & Your Husband" is the outpouring of Jennifer's passion for godly marriages, and I loved the challenge of keeping up with her passion! The vision Jennifer has is for wives to experience God intensely and in turn deepen their relationship with their own husband.I took on her 30 day challenge, and while I have not completed it yet (I'm nearly halfway), I can attest first-hand that the devotionals, Scripture reading, journal questions, and daily challenge have directly influenced my recent spiritual growth: drawing me closer to the Lord, and also developing my relationship with my husband. Jennifer presents very easy to follow instructions for doing the study (either for yourself or in a group setting). She makes it so easy to read and meditate on focal Scriptures, and lays out a daily challenge that is concise and applicable to the theme for that day's reading and journal points. I am usually disappointed with devotionals and their light nature, but Jennifer kept Scripture primary and weaved the themes of Biblical truth and principle through every element. I have looked forward to my time reading and journaling each day because of the great challenge she packages as well as the encouragement received in finding wisdom and knowledge.I would highly recommend this devotional to any Christian wife or even to a group of ladies wanting to grow in community!

$review_text.: Recently I have fallen out of love with Middle Grade Fantasy Books. I've lost interest in the obligatory paint-by-numbers format which often involves the typical Coming-of-Age, Ancient Prophecy and The Chosen One storylines. No doubt those are the main attractions to this genre. But there's something very wearisome about picking up a book and knowing exactly how it will turn out because you've read that story a thousand times already.I was a bit apprehensive when I accepted the chance to read this book and would probably have passed on it if not for the unique African setting which is practically never used in a children's fantasy book. Having now read this book from cover-to-cover, I am thankful that I didn't make that mistake.The Enchanted Castle, Book One of the Shioni of Sheba series, is a very magical and spellbinding tale. Every page is bursting with fun and excitement. The story moves quickly, but is richly narrated. I hadn't heard of or previously encountered the legends that inspire this book. But it wasn't hard to figure out that the story had roots in the folktales of the ancient peoples of sub-Saharan Africa. This authenticity lends not only credibility to the story, but helps to give it its richness.I am impressed with the writing style of the author. The prose is very inviting and suitable for children and adults alike. Despite the exotic setting and ancient landscape, the characters feel very familiar. You can relate to the plight of Shioni, the young slave girl who is the central figure in this series. The supporting cast is equally delightful. You can't help but feel for Shioni during her trials or cheer her on as she navigates her very complicated world of royal and military figures as well as fellow slaves who don't miss an opportunity to make her life excruciatingly difficult. I especially liked that this story had a positive message for young people and believe Shioni is a character they can be proud to emulate.This is an amazing book and one of the recent few that I know I'll go back and read again. This book just narrowly missed a 5-star rating due to some editing issues. However, I am an instant fan of this book and will certainly seek out more books in the series. If they are half as good as this one, then I'm in for a treat. I highly recommend this book especially to older children, teachers, and adults who love a good and uplifting fantasy adventure.4.5 Stars for an impressive and magical adventure that features a memorable cast of characters that readers will instantly fall in love with.Disclaimer: I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest, non-reciprocal review.

I really like Michael Bunker's style of writing and who else could make a great story about the amish and sci-fy future stuff? I would recommend this series to others!

$review_text.: Sometimes the biggest battle with losing weight and embracing a healthier lifestyle is in the mind because of the self-talk we use to justify not doing what we know we should.  Things like "I'll start a diet tomorrow" or "I can't afford to eat healthy."  The author calls these detour thoughts; the kind of thinking that gets us off track and enables us to avoid doing what we know we should.  Sometimes the thoughts are judgmental such as "I'm so fat", "I have no willpower", or "Why try? It won't work anyway."The author takes each of the fifty excuses in this book and refutes them while also showing how to replace self-sabotaging thoughts with proactive ones that lead to success.  The book begins with a chapter on mindful thinking which I found very helpful, especially the insights as to why we make excuses and are our own worst critics.  Being aware of what is going on and what choices we are making helps us see the reality instead of resorting to the excuses.  Albers writes, "...you do have the power to choose how you respond to whatever positive or negative thoughts happen to pop into your mind.  It doesn't sound like a grand solution, but being conscious and mindfully aware of your thoughts can take you a long way."The chapters addressing the excuses are short and can be read several at a time or one at a time as a daily focus.  Each entry is followed by an "On Second Thought" section that prompts the reader to take action on something whether it be to create a discipline of reading the ingredients on a package, journaling prompts, suggestions for eliminating mindless eating in front of the t.v., etc.  All are very helpful and practical.I like this book and it is one I will keep on hand to review.  Anyone who struggles with sticking with a diet or fitness plan will benefit from the information.I received a copy of this book for review from the publisher but the opinion of it is my own and was not solicited, nor was a positive review required.

$review_text.: The Earl's Scandalous Wife by Ruth Ann NordinMarriage by Scandal Series Book 4Perry Ambrose, the Earl of Clement has had no luck in finding a wife. And he actually wanted one. He was born with one leg a bit shorter, and he was sure the use of his cane was an embarrassment. So he couldn't believe his luck when a scandal caused him to marry. And everything about his new wife was so wonderful. The things he knew at least.Paula Leighton had marred her past a bit with some bad choices. Now her brother was selling her off to an old drunken geezer. No way would she marry that old man. She had one chance to find someone and cause a scandal. She just didn't think she could find someone who was as perfect as the man she chose, a man she didn't feel she deserved.It's finally Perry's turn for happiness. Through this series we see him as he seriously pursues a wife and deals with his young ward, Christopher Robinson, which was definitely no easy chore. The author brings back all the friends the reader has met in the previous three books; The Earl's Inconvenient Wife, A Most Unsuitable Earl and His Reluctant Lady.**Sexual content within marriage&#8203;

$REVIEW.: As the other reviews pointed out, this book is about mental physical and spiritual health for the musician, or anyone else for that matter. It is a well rounded book. The author is a chiropractor and a worship pastor as well. He brings a different perspective from the medical community and as a musician himself. In other words, he uses this stuff in his day to day life.It starts out with answering the question of why is wellness is important for any musician. As a musician myself, I have had to cancel gigs or suffer through gigs because I was sick. Let me tell you, being healthy and feeling good is a must to stay on top of your game.The chapter on exercise might be boring for some people if you have been exercising for some time. If you don't know anything about exercise as a beginner, it is a helpful guide to the basics.The chapter on nutrition is brief and to the point. There are other books from Vendera Publishing that are more detailed and in depth than this book is if you need more information. Did you know there is a Musician's Diet?True to the chiropractor that he is, the author talks to us about spinal health, posture as it refers to the vocalist. My posture is usually bad unless I am singing classical music. I always need more reminders! He includes how to find a good chiropractor in your area if you have spine or pain issues.Our favorite subject-sleep is in chapter 5. If you ever needed the excuse to sleep in or take that well-deserved nap, here it is! I get reacl cranky and brain foggy if I don't get my 8 hours.How do you protect your voice from the toxic environment? You're going to find some helpful tips here.Most people don't think the mind has anything to do with wellness until they notice someone in their lives with depression, self destructing thoughts and speech, or drowning in negativity. Being around those kind of people suck the life out of you! He talks about routine, positive affirmations, journaling, and television influences. Garbage in equals garbage out.The author, as a worship pastor, takes a chapter to talk about his personal spiritual life and well as finding your own spiritual path. Music that you create or listen to should impact the world for the better. Are you doing that with your music? What is your purpose in life? He covers giving thanks, having faith, and finding God as a source of creativity in your life. If you don't believe in God, he says to just keep reading and have an open mind, but he does not push his beliefs on anyone.One of my favorite parts of the book was the chapter on the dangers of allopathic medicine. Chiropractors are more widely accepted in the medical field now, much more than in years past. It is because the world has been exploring other alternatives to wellness that don't include toxic drugs and surgery. Yes, modern medicine is great for emergencies and saving lives, but it doesn't offer much hope for longterm health except for the dependance of toxic drugs that carry more side effects than the original ailment. Anyway, he gives his insight into the issue.So overall, I would recommend this book to anyone that needs to make positive, major changes in their lives. If you feel you already have the basics down and need more detail in the same subjects, I would also recommend some of Jaime Vendera's books on health as well.

$REVIEW.: This was without a doubt the best of a half dozen &#34;vegan&#34; or plant-based cookbooks I had ordered or perused


Some of the author's dishes have become household regulars here

They include the incredibly tasty and nutritious Hippie Meatloaf, the fabulous tasting and so easy to make Portobello Steaks and the wonderful tasting Fettuccine Alfredo

For those who opt for plant-based meals, there is no longer a reason to proclaim what you do not eat

Instead, many of us  using this cookbook proudly announce the many delightful dishes we do eat
We particularly like that Lindsay Nixon, the author,  adheres strongly to the science behind that shown in the documentary Forks Over Knives and her recipes encourage little or no oil and using parchment paper for baking
She also is a strong advocate for using natural fruits, vegetables and grains


This is the number one cookbook among my many others grabbed in haste.

One good thing, though, is meeting Charlie. He is one character that i liked throughout the story.There are several storylines woven in nicely and characters that add spice to the main plot.Eva's boss and &#34;boyfriend&#34; Victor is a very unlikable person.

I was not disappointed
The author starts you out at a fast pace and the book becomes a page turner
It is hot, sensual, erotic, action packed


The hits just keep on coming and the enemies are all around
the decisions to be made are tough and everything is on the line

The tension builds as Shasta faces crucial life moments as we realizes that she is just a young woman who wanted to survive and eat
There is love in the book

A mother son relationship and many other identifiable elements that draws you in to each and every chapter
Lynise is an author to watch out for
She knows her stuff and her rankings prove it
I recommend this book and give it 5 stars.

$REVIEW.: The biblical story of Esther shines in a new light as "A Reluctant" Queen."Follow along as this story begins with Esther sharing the background of her upbringing as a young female Jew, who has lost both her parents and being raised by her uncle, Mordecai. She loves her uncle very much, so when he says that he has had a dream from God and that she must obey it by competing for the Great King's favor, she feels that it is her duty to obey and trust in him.Becoming his wife, Esther feels the love for him growing, even as she denies her past and upbringing for fear of the pain of possible loss and rejection. Can their love survive the truth of her past? Will she be able to protect her people from a vicious outcome if she reveals her true self? This story of becoming Queen to the woman he truly loves will keep you turning those pages!I truly enjoyed this wonderful love story. Esther is such a strong character that you wanted to follow her and see where it lead. Even when she wasn't sure what to believe, you wanted to see if God would show her the answers and how that would come about.I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good love story containing a strong biblical background!! It is a really enjoyable read!!This book was provided to me by Booksneeze for my honest review.

$review_text.: This was a fun series to read.  The characters were interesting,  and I liked the different take on the Atlantis myth.  The only negative thing I found was that some of it did not seem complete or finished. At the end of book one, Bridget is pregnant with triplets. There is no mention of them again, even in the epilogue. Did Bridget have the triplets, or did she miscarry, as was predicted by her husband, Caderyn?  Cassandra was cured of her cancer, did she ever get pregnant?  Did they find the Olympians secret passage, and stop them from going into the sea after more men?  Just some questions I was left with, that were not addressed in the epilogue.  Otherwise, an entertaining tale.

$review_text.: When I chose to read and review "Starry Knights", I had no preconceived notions of what to expect from a first time author detailing an obscure game in my memory of a football series that no longer exists.  Wow!  Am I glad I dove in and devoured this light, fast-paced read that is both informative and nostalgic for those of us who remember the annual College All-Star Game series that finally ended in 1976.  McCarthy pays homage to the last collection of college all-stars to beat the defending NFL champion in this series that stretched from 1933 to 1976."Starry Knights" is well written and edited and, improbably, one does not have to be a sports fan to appreciate the story and the history.  The history of sporting contests is filled with mismatched teams from the little league level to the professional level.  Sporting dynasties and odds-on favorites would, over time, discourage betting and cheering on sports and games involving underdog teams if there were never unbelievable upsets such as the NY Jets beating the vaunted Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III and the US Hockey team outlasting the powerful Russians in the 1980 Olympic Games.  The College All-Stars made just such an upset against the mighty Green Bay Packers on a hot humid August night at Soldier Field in Chicago.  As someone said many decades ago, despite the odds, the heavy favorites, or the disrespected underdogs, anything can happen on any given night-- "it's why they play the games".McCarthy does a masterful job of presenting the history of the College All-Star game as a prelude to focusing on the 1963 game.  History is revisited as he reviews the writers, charities, coaches, and players who made this college/pro game so important as the professional game matured and transitioned into the behemoth it is today.  Along the way, he also colorfully describes the social and cultural changes occuring in the US during each of the eras that this game flouorished.  He presents interesting back stories in these reminders of the societal changes that accompanied changes in pro football.McCarthy presents a tense, at times, nailbiting recreation of the actual game played between a stable of superior College All-Stars who coalesced around their great coach, Otto Graham and the team often touted at that time as the greatest professional football team in history, the Green Bay Packers led by their Hall of Fame coach, Vince Lombardi.  I remember the game and the series.  I watched the 1963 Rose Bowl Game described in great detail by the author as an introduction to the late-blooming Ron Vanderkelen from Wisconsin who led a breathtaking comeback only to finish on the losing end of a 42-37 score but who distinguished himself well enough to gain a spot on the miracle All-Star team of 1963.Having witnessed and studied the games described in "Starry Knights", I can unequivocally recommend this book to any fan of football, sports in general, or those who love tales of the downtrodden underdog rising up against overwhelming odds to snatch victory from defeat and to prove "that's why they play the games"--to see who will win, despite what the odds makers tell us.

$REVIEW.: I love all things paranormal, and I&#8217;m always on the lookout for the next series to catch my eye. This book starts off with a bang. I was hooked from the moment I began reading, and I experienced my favorite feeling: anger! Angry when I had to put the book down for one reason or another, angry with one of the characters, angry with some twists in the plot. I love a book that makes me feel something- the more real the feelings, the better.I loved the main character, Lilly, and her determination to be so strong in the face of her grief. The male main, Daemon, was so&#8230; likable. And every time I thought I knew what was coming and why, I was wrong. To me that&#8217;s the best part of reading. I get bored when I figure out how it will all end long before reaching the last page.There were a few typos- wrong word usage (for exactly, &#8216;roll&#8217; instead of &#8216;role&#8217;) but that did not detract from my reading experience. I definitely loved this book, and the character I love to hate is the star for the second book. I&#8217;ll definitely be downloading it! 5 stars, and highly recommended to anyone who enjoys paranormal, Celtic lore, ghosts, hauntings, and visions!

$review_text.: Debbie Jackson has written a book suitable for beginners and experienced polymer clay enthusiasts.  The work is different and has a distinct style of its own.  Even if your tastes don't run to ethnic art, these projects are easily adaptable to suit your own style and taste.  The instructions are very clear and the photography is beautifully done.  There are a wide range of projects included and Polymer Clay Jewelry would be a great addition to your library.  The hinged pendant is beautiful and I can't wait to try making one of my own.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed this story however I do have a few things to say.  I felt that the characters were underdeveloped.  I found that while the characters were expressive emotionally  I did not really empathize with them at all and that left me feeling a bit unsatisfied at the end of the story.  I felt that the story has potential but lacks the depth of a truly good story that leaves me wanting more.  Would I buy the sequel? Probably just to see if the characters get any better and to see where the story goes.  Would I recommend this to a friend?  Probably but not as one of my favorites.

$review_text.: The pure extermination camps: Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, and Chelmo existed solely for the purpose killing all Jews - not forced labour, not political prisons, just extermination.  They have a tiny number survivors.  The non-jewish guards/workers said nothing.  The survivors found it very hard to tell their story.  That is why this book is so important.

$REVIEW.: I love all 3 (and a half) books about Lexi but this one is my favorite (right after the first)


It must be because Slash is so much in it :-)  I just love the way he treats Lexi

Lexi rocks it again in this book and..

saves the day in the end.The ending made me think really hard about who would be the best guy for Lexi


I am all Slash but I like Elvis as well
She shared great scenes with both men but the scene in the hospital with Slash...
ooooohhh

I am team Slash all the way but I would understand if the author went with Elvis

I do hope there will be some conclusion to this in the next book


If this goes on too long there will be heartbreak on my part....

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed reading this book. Yes, it had a few problems, both of which were mentioned earlier:She's a law student. Her boss almost rapes her. She goes quietly into the night. WTF?!He and she were dating for over a month. He said he loved her. He gave her a long guilty stare when she walked in on him with the other woman. And 6 years later he doesn't remember her??? It's not like people age that dramatically from 17 to 23, and even not straightening hair shouldn't cause that. That just didn't work for me. Maybe he did a lot of pot or something.However, I still managed to like Jennifer and Jared. And Chris. And Cynthia. And the best friend (whose name totally escapes me right now and I'm too lazy to look it up). On the negative side, both fathers totally sucked.But still, I read it in one afternoon and was completely entertained. For $.99, you can't ask for more than that. Definitely worth the read - it's fiction, it doesn't have to make sense, it just has to make you happy.

$REVIEW.: There are several alluring images and stories in this book along with some poetry. The authors even insert themselves into the stories as guides, which I found quite humorous. The stories capture the imagination with genies and magical movements as well as the initiation of a female shaman or holy woman into her role. I enjoyed the story about the Valley of the Yellow Stones and its lessons about greed. I liked the way both people and animals interacted in the book. Also, the role of one generation with another was well-done. It's a good way to get children involved with the various tasks and scenarios. Highly recommended.

Call it WWII war novel, para normal novel, psyche thriller
The narration is smooth, given that the novel deals with two timelines :1941and 2013

$review_text.: The Visitors: Eight Takes of Strange Encounters by Earl Roske is a collection of short stories, each with an interesting premise. The tales are built around circumstances common to many of us topped off with an unexpected supernatural twist. The stories are not extensively developed which makes this book a good choice if you are standing in line or waiting for someone and are looking for a quick and entertaining read.I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to provide a review and found it to be suitable for light readers and young adults as well. This writer has a rich imagination and, hopefully, will take time in his future works to develop the story lines as well as the characters in more depth.

$REVIEW.: I could not put this down!There are a lot of stories of ultrarunners who were once addicts...Charlie Engel is one of the most famous ones, but I feel like we read so much about people who were addicts (drug, alcohol, whatever) who quit their vice of choice and pick up ultrarunning as their new addiction.But this story - though it pulls up on that theme - is far from trite. Rather, it seems NEW. The way Mishka Shubaly writes it, you become completely engaged, and you completely understand. And the transition, the long runs, everything - it seems really reasonable.I think it's because he's so charming.Mishka Shubaly starts off by telling you his entrance to running - and goes backwards to tell you how far he had come. A complete alcoholic and drug addict, some might have thought he was wasting his life by acting like a complete jerk (at times) or just like someone under the influence and unable to be 100% the human being most of us strive to be. But really, he's charming. You see him mess up again, on drugs and alcohol, but you still like him. You want him to get help.And you're glad when he does.And you're glad when he goes beyond even what you expect of a former addict.And really, you're even happier when he goes beyond what you expect of a normal person.He goes from alcoholic/drug addict to superman ultrarunner.It's beyond impressive. It's fascinating.If only all the alcoholics we knew had this story.Happy endings happen sometimes...

$review_text.: Roni Loren's Still Into You made for a sexy, heart-felt and fun read that was quick and a great little treat while waiting for Melt Into You.Seth and Leila met in college and married after Leila found out that she was pregnant. Seth has spent the last eight years of their marriage trying to prove to his wealthy father-in-law that he is worthy of his daughter, working hard to earn a corporate position at his job and finally be able to afford the life his wife is use to. What Seth didn't realize was that all work and no play have almost cost him the one thing he was working so hard for - his wife and kids. It's only after a night of Leno instead of sex and an awkward moment catching his wife in the shower that Seth realizes just how far he and Leila have drifted apart. Determined to spice things up for them, Seth turns to his brother-in-law and owner of the adult store, Wicked. But when he hears his wife calling into a radio show admitting that she almost cheated Seth knows that he has to take drastic measures if he hopes to save his marriage.Leila doesn't know what to do. She loves her husband deeply but he is never around anymore and lately she has found herself wanting things she knows that she can never share with him. In college Seth was the bad-boy in a band whose passion set her on fire. But somewhere along the way he lost that edge and now, she can barely remember what he looks like with the lights on. When another man shows her an interest that her husband hasn't shown her in years, Leila is tempted and that scares her more than anything.Seth isn't about to let another man take his wife though and so he packs the kids off to his parents and books three days at The Ranch. Three days, no vows and all of Leila's fantasies realized; if she doesn't want to be with him after that he'll walk away but he's not about to give up without a fight. Seth is willing to do whatever it takes to get his wife back, even if that means sharing her with another man. Leila reluctantly agrees but what happens after fantasy becomes reality? Will they be able to face the consequences together?Roni Loren packed a lot of story into a little package with Still Into You. I think that most married couples who have been together through that seven-year-itch are going to be able to instantly relate to this story.When Still Into You begins I found myself sympathizing with Seth. He knew that Leila was it for him, the end and I loved how he was willing to go to any and all lengths to save his marriage with her. But as the story continues and Seth begins to make a few discoveries about himself I found that I was putting myself in Leila's shoes and sympathizing with her more and more. It's never been about the money for Leila; she just wanted the boy she married to return. It was a great look into how two people evolve over their time of marriage. How sometimes, without even meaning too, the relationship can grow stagnant and you begin to take each other for granted. It was a great story of two hearts reconnecting and becoming even stronger than they were before.I really loved this story. Roni Loren pens the perfect tale of marriage, family, the responsibilities and disappoints that follow and finding that needed spark to keep your marriage going. Roni Loren is fast becoming a must-read erotic romance author for me and I can't wait to read Melt Ino You now with Jace. I also hope that we see more of Master Van in the continuing stories as well. This book was set up well to read as a stand-alone.**I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.**

$REVIEW.: Who would of thought an encounter with a butterfly could bring you face to face with your very own hero and your knight in shining armor. Kennedy is faced with the choice of having hunky fireman, Luke, or gorgous Addison. But why choose one when you can have them both, or can she?Kennedy is a feisty American who is trying to find her place in life. She is trying to forget her one night stand in New York and come to terms with her kinky fantasies. She is like any woman trying to find a balance in what she really wants and what is expected of her. Australian Luke is a sweetheart who is trying to resist his urges and being confused by new ones. I love his honesty to himself and that he misses signs just like the rest of us do. And the stunning British rake, Addison doesn't disappoint. I loved seeing him evolve from the fun loving devil may care man into something more. These three are a treat to get to know, and oh so sinful.Review copy provided for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: Amazing attention to detail. Provides useful data on materials, dimensions and techniques applied to many varieties of Medieval swords, even going into estimated carbon content of various early steels. Similar attention to authenticity and detail in describing techniques and styles of swordsmanship. The drawings used are very easy to follow, better than trying to decipher photographs, and clearly demonstrate the movements and techniques detailed in the text.The author is occasionally rabid in his disregard for fantasy and sport enthusiasts, but that is understandable, considering the culturally-ingrained stereotypes he has to overcome before he can even begin to teach.Sadly, few of us will ever be in a position to train in the way the author recommends.  I agree with the author that banging away with sticks is a poor reflection of actual medieval sword techniques; unfortunately, that's as close as most of us can realistically come.An outstanding reference for anyone interested in Medieval swords and the way they were actually used.
$SUMMARY.: A great reference.

$review_text.: What an excellent book this is. For that matter, all of the Air Disaster volumes by Macarthur Job are first-rate. It's hard to imagine cramming any more detail into each chapter than is provided here! And the illustrations are top drawer as well. Some of these drawings are actually quite eerie, giving the reader a look at what the accident must have actually looked like. These sketches, like the text, are very detailed as well. If you are fascinated with plane crashes and &#34;what really happened&#34;, you must purchase this (and all subsequent) volumes.Volume 1 of this series of books includes 18 riveting true-life tales of disaster aboard a wide variety of commercial aircraft -- from the series of BOAC &#34;Comet&#34; crashes in 1954, to a Swissair &#34;Caravelle&#34; in September 1963, to a Capitol Airways DC-8 in November 1970, to a BEA &#34;Trident&#34; in June 1972, to a Turkish McDonnell Douglas DC-10 in March 1974, and lots more.My two favorite chapters from this volume are .............&#62;&#62; Chapter #12 -- The crash of Eastern Airlines Flight 401 in Miami, Florida, on the night of December 29, 1972. That's the famous accident which had a Lockheed L-1011 plunging into the Everglades because a cheap landing-gear light failed to illuminate, causing the crew of the TriStar much grief and, ultimately, caused the aircraft to crash into the pitch-black Everglades near Miami International Airport. This is also the fatal crash that spawned the book and movie, &#34;The Ghost Of Flight 401&#34;.&#62;&#62; Chapter #18 -- Chronicling in fascinatingly-microscopic detail the single worst disaster in commercial aviation history (to date), claiming 583 lives: the March 27, 1977, accident in Tenerife (Canary Islands), when two Boeing 747 Jumbo Jets collided on the ground in heavy fog. The many photos, graphs, and charts (along with the practically minute-by-minute text account) do a nice job of placing the reader RIGHT THERE in Tenerife before, during, and after the accident. A chapter worth multiple re-reads.A &#34;Did You Know?&#34; aviation trivia fact ........................Did You Know .... that the Pan Am Boeing 747 involved in the horrific crash at Tenerife in 1977 was the same identical airplane that had the distinction of being the very first Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet to operate a flight in commercial service? The aircraft, registered as &#34;N736PA&#34;, was the 11th B747 ever built, first taking to the skies on its first test flight on Christmas Eve 1969. Less than one month later, the big jet was placed into revenue service with Pan American Airways, becoming the first 747 to transport paying passengers when it flew from New York to London on January 22, 1970. Seven years later it met its fate when a fellow 747 of KLM collided with her on a foggy runway in the Canary Islands.The later &#34;Air Disaster&#34; editions, like this first one, are literally jam-packed with unbelievably-detailed info on many major airliner crashes. These &#34;Air Disaster&#34; volumes earn a &#34;Highest Recommendation&#34; moniker, in this writer's humble opinion.

The title pretty much sums it up


Leah and Claire are married and want to spice up their sex lives so they embark on a sexual adventure in hopes of improving their relationship with their husbands.The only problem I had with the book is when friends of Michael, Leah's husband, Ethan and Asher randomly show up in the middle of the book when Clair's husband, John, visits Leah in Chicago

These characters and the story line involving them just do not fit in with the rest of the story

$REVIEW.: This is the retelling of one woman's trysts with other men whilst married and not even in an entertaining sort of way.  It's more of a "gee I don't give a dam* and neither should you" sort of way. The author here seems to be trying to convince herself that her choices are valid and in doing so lost me somewhere.  I admit I read 3/4 of this book and just could not carry on no matter how hard I tried.  I think it's shameless to be in a marriage and brag about your infidelity in a book for the purposes of what?  To see your name on the cover?  To earn some cash?  I'm ok with her actions if both parties were in agreement (poor husband of hers...) but...to broadcast it?  WHY??? Again I must ask...why???????????

She was a huge drawback in the previous books.In this one, however, the author has toned down Lady Amanda's elitist snobbery a bit and made her more bearable and human.Unfortunately, the character of Hugo has become somewhat irritating now.  His increased fumbling around and sometimes clueless demeanor reminds me of what was done to the character of Davey Carmichael in the Falconer Files series.  Once endearing, the author's insistence on having Carmichael constantly vomiting and highlighting his childish (and borderline mentally challenged) behavior became tiresome.A book doesn't need constant buffoonery to be amusing.

$review_text.: Dream Child is the third book.This is around Lizzie now having the dreams, as well as her mom, Sara


Lizzie is suppose to be four and she is allowed to follow her mom around the hospital on her rounds.It's a cute cozy mystery, quirky and if you like that thing, you will enjoy it.For me....the kid in the hospital all the time with the mom, the four year old seeing mobsters in dreams and corrupt politicians, the way sometime Sara is strong and confident and then the next time she is talking she is mousy and flaky, it drove me nuts
 My personal opinion.

$REVIEW.: Given the calendar, I was in the mood for a ghost story, and a friend recommended Northern Light by debut author E.J. Russell. I'm so glad I took the recommendation. I don't read a ton of M/M romance, (although I find good M/M just as sweet, sexy and engaging as good traditional M/F romance, it's just sometimes I feel like a peeping Tom-ette, checking out the salacious details of a different lifestyle). But Northern Light didn't take me there. It took me on an emotionally gripping ride involving ex-lovers still battling plenty of chemistry, who land on opposite sides of a suspected art forgery. If all that history and conflict weren't enough, there's also some ghostly interference afoot.Luke and Stefan felt real to me--their regrets, their frustrations. Confronting an ex is never easy...especially not the one you never really got over.  The external plot provided a perfect framework to force these two into each other's lives again. And the ghost story...that just takes the tension to a whole `nother level!Northern Light is a short, intriguing, spine-tingling read. The perfect precursor to Halloween!

$review_text.: Most of us know the myth of Persephone and Hades, but here the author gave some fresh ideas to the tale.  Hades was presented as a strong but sympathetic and desirable character.  His love and longing for Persephone were swoon-worthy, rather than frightening or skeevy.  If you were going to spend time in the Underworld, *this* Hades is the one you'd gladly do it for!On that note, the Underworld was presented in an interesting way was well, and I enjoyed reading about how Hades came to rule it and how that impacted his interactions with other gods.As to Persephone, I loooved her!  I felt that she was presented a strong, fully realized  character in her own right, rather than some weak, whiny victim that needed to be rescued.  She was a true god in this book with powers of her own and intelligence, and this was so refreshing to see.  There were interesting twists in her background and a very surprising explanation for why she cared about humans.The relationship development and action were very good.  The story here really was superb.  I  truly enjoyed this book and will probably re-read it some point.  Persephone and Hades are one of my favorite "couples" in literature, since in my mind, their story is a variant of Beauty and the Beast (which is my favorite theme).With all that said, there were some severe editing issues with this book.  It was riddled with errors, misspellings, wrong words, conflated words, etc, etc.  The errors were all.up.and.through. this book.  It was beyond the need for a professional editor. I felt that the book was have benefited greatly if the author had just gotten one of her good girlfriends to proofread it and make corrections.  However, the story itself outshone these editing problems.  The story was head and shoulders above the editing and was 5+ star worthy in my opinion.  I really hope the author will issue a corrected version and do this work justice.

$review_text.: This was a great read. I started it and couldn't put it down. Mac and Matt both made me laugh out loud. This was a great balance between steamy sex and humor. It made the characters seem more realistic. Even though I could care less about some of the legal jargon sprinkled in because I didn't understand it, I loved this couple. Mac is a strong female character with opinions and feelings and absolutely no filter. That made me like her even more. Even when Matt was being a douche you couldn't help but love him because you knew he was only lashing out because he was protecting himself from being hurt again. I finished this in a few hours. It was a fast paced but great read.

$review_text.: Mary Leo has used the Richard Speck case to frame a fairly cliched fictional story. It is clear from the story's beginning that Carly, a Hollywood talent recruiter (for extras) is harboring some deep guilt over the famous case. She drinks, she broods, and she is definitely carrying a heavy burden. While the book is well-written, I found it hard to clearly connect with any of the characters. There is strength is Leo's use of the real life case to frame the story, and her vignettes about the victims are effective.

$REVIEW.: This series is getting and steamier crazier by the second!4 STARS FOR ZANE & V!Ok, so I&#8217;m all for experimentation between characters, threesomes, mixing it up, etc&#8230; but with lot it just seems pretty much any hole&#8217;s a goal! Lol! They&#8217;re sticking it everywhere and anywhere&#8230; cowboys turning bi-sexual every which way, women regularly acting as the filling in all kinds of delicious mandwiches, everyone shoving everyone up against walls, strange sexual tension between him and him and her and him&#8230; it made my head spin!&#8220;You&#8217;re looking forward to being the cream filling in that little sandwich, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;But I have to admit *blushes* I did kinda love it!&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you thinking about anything else except what it&#8217;s going to feel like to have me buried deep inside of you. I want you visualizing what it&#8217;ll be like to have both of us f***ing you until you can&#8217;t take any more. Understand me?&#8221;Oh, well if you insist!There is one thing I am sorely disappointed about with this book. I think the author missed two tricks for incredibly hot, heavy scenes with 'Zane'. Firstly, the sex club&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty sure we could have had a super steamy scene with Zane and V when they visited Club Destiny.Secondly&#8230; the stripper scene in Vegas. The author writes that Zoey kisses another girl and teases both Kaleb and Gage&#8230; whaaaat? I wanna read that scene, not hear about it second hand!!! So, I had a little internal tantrum about that.However, that is definitely not to say that this book is lacking on the hot and heavy front. Ooooh no! This is just as steamy as 'Kaleb', perhaps a little more so. The M/F/M scenes in this book take it to another level. We get a little M/M action too. *fans self*'There was something to be said about seeing two men together. Especially these two alphas. Big, strong, handsome, intensely masculine men in the throes of passion were titillating.'The plot was a game of two halves for me. The first half of the book I found myself skimming some parts. It really felt like just nothing was happening. But the second half picked up nicely and I felt it began to flow a bit better. More happened, the pace sped up, etc. etc. And I liked the way things played out with V and Zane toward the end of the book, too.'Each minute that passed, the fissures he&#8217;d made in those invisible walls she&#8217;d erected so long ago continues to get bigger while the little cracks in her heart continued to get smaller.'I have to say I&#8217;m getting a little fed up of these I-can&#8217;t-have-a-relationship-with-him heroines. V was very similar to Zoey in that way. Seriously? Ok, so you&#8217;ve got some issues, but he&#8217;s hot, he&#8217;s sweet, he loves you, you love him, he protects you from the baddies, he gives you regular mind-blowing orgasms anyway&#8230; woman the f*** up, lady!&#8220;He loves you, V. I&#8217;ve never seen him love someone that way before.&#8221;As was Kaleb, Zane is a prime hunk of man meat! He&#8217;s the youngest of the seven Walker brothers, but he&#8217;s no less delicious! And again, same as Kaleb, he&#8217;s muscled, controlling, determined, sweet, gorgeous, you get the idea. And where the hell do these guys come from because yet again, we have another scorchin&#8217; hot best friend who likes to get involved in all the three-way lovin&#8217;. Is this a Texan thing?? Or a cowboy thing? Because if it is, just say the word. My bags will be packed and I&#8217;ll be on a flight over quicker than you can say &#8216;two step&#8217;!'For some reason, when Zane was close, her clothes just seemed to fall off.'So yeh, once again, nothing monumental plot wise, nothing heart wrenching, nothing profound, although I did find the angst and plot line to be a little more substantial than in the first book. But overall this is just good, hard-core, panty-combusting, book whore lovin&#8217; smut! If you want to just switch off and curl up with a book that needs very little brain power but that will make you all hot and bothered, these books are great!&#8220;I want to hear you scream. I want your neighbour&#8217;s to know who is f***ing you, V. Scream for me, baby.&#8221;And again, same as the first book, Zane and V&#8217;s story is all wrapped in their own happy ending, yet the epilogue leaves you with a cliffhanger eluding to the plot of the next book. Nicely done, Ms. Edwards!Have you read it?

$review_text.: Other reviewers have drawn attention to Sowell's attack on white liberals' efforts to "enable" the dysfunctional Southern black culture in the U.S. But Sowell's argument also blows apart the alleged moral superiority of all the poor Southern whites who now tend to support the Republican Party and its conservative cultural and political agendas. The Southern states' higher levels of social pathologies like violent assaults (derived in part from Scotch-Irish touchiness about "honor") make the U.S. look more like a Third World country than comparably developed societies in Western Europe. Sociologists will tell you that if we could filter out the Southern component from American culture, our social problems would tend to fall more into line with what you'd expect in a properly civilized country. Even the droogs in Europe tend to behave themselves better than the ones here. The Muslim youths who rioted in France a few months back killed only a handful of people, whereas comparable disorders in the U.S., like L.A.'s Rodney King riots (involving culturally Southern blacks), can rack up scores of murder victims.Sowell's characterization of Southern whites also explains why so many of them have fallen for this nonsense about the "rapture," where they believe that Jesus will beam them into heaven in this generation without having to die first. People in chronically impoverished cultures who don't seem to get anywhere, even when they have opportunities to better themselves, stay that way because they prefer to seek instant gratification instead of saving and investing money and planning for the future. (Needless to say, these people also tend to waste a lot of money on lottery tickets.) The rapture belief fits right into this culture of expecting a big reward (like winning the rapture lottery) without having to cultivate the self-discipline to work and plan for it first, as the Calvinist theologian and free-market economist Gary North complains in his essay, "Left Behind Culturally."

As a romance, it's necessary for the reader to get a sense of the development of the relationship between the main characters. Instead, there are more side plots going on that draw attention away from the main plot. They are interesting, but not necessarily integral. I just didn't see the development in the courtship, and thus, the union in the end was anticlimactic for me.

$review_text.: Beware that this book is based on the Anasazi Foundation, which is owned and run by the LDS church
 Just like North Star and Evergreen (look them up) these organizations use force and cruelty to whittle down a young person (by physical exhaustion and mental abuse) until they are following the mormon doctrine without any thought of individuality

 Basically your teen will come back as a &#34;Stepford Wife.&#34;Sound funny?  It's not


 I'm a 7th generation mormon (ex, thankfully!) that gained my eagle and order of light, served a mission and almost got married in the SLC Temple, until I woke up to my concerns I'd had since childhood, about the Mormon church.Please


 If you value your children, no matter how unruly they are, as a part of you, then don't send them to these camps

 This book is another form of LDS propaganda that makes it look like the Anasazi Indian's were Lamanites - Jews that came to America a little over two thousand years ago


 Since then, science has proven the Book of Mormon wrong - showing that Native American DNA is actually Asian (various locations) in ancestry, not Jewish


 Yet Mormons still fight science and claim that Joseph Smith, a man that married a 14 year old girl named Helen Mar Kimball (look it up) was right and our science - today - is wrong.Do your research well and put a lot of thought into how much scandal these teen programs have been in the last decade - teens have died (again, you can find this online, don't take my word for it)

 You don't need to pray about it, you know deep inside that it's wrong to have your teen programmed by total strangers through a horribly, forceful manner.

As a result, the world of mid-19th-century New Haven, Connecticut literally comes alive through her skillful research and writing.This book is one that I appreciated best in retrospect. It was always historically and intellectually fascinating, but rarely emotionally compelling (except in the last fifty pages, which I read in one fell swoop). Typically, I read a book through to the end in one to three days, but &#8220;The Writing Master&#8221; took me three weeks to finish. As an Amazon Vine reviewer, I always have a stack of books waiting to be read. I kept putting this book down and starting and finishing another book before going back, once again, to pick up &#8220;The Writing Master.&#8221; In fact, I read four other books while I was finishing this one. Despite the many interruptions, I was always pleased to get back to Florey&#8217;s book. It was a intriguing world and it made me happy to rediscover it again each time I picked up the book. It was like taking a trip backwards in time, back into a whole different perspective on life&#8212;a lovely, long-ago landscape with odd anachronistic characters and objects.There is much detail to the plot. In fact, the book suffers&#8212;perhaps&#8212;from too many interlocking plot threads. To the author&#8217;s great credit, she does manage successfully to tie these many odd and separate stories into a cohesive and very satisfying whole by the end. That&#8217;s, no doubt, why the book appeared better in retrospect than it did while I was reading it. This is one of those plots where the end is so worthwhile that it makes the trip getting there seem all the more satisfying on reflection. While reading the book, I was sure that I&#8217;d rate it only three stars; however, once I finished it, I was convinced that four stars was more appropriate.The story tracks a half a year in the lives of two main characters. They each tell their own stories in alternating chapters and voices. First, there is  Charles Cooper, a twenty-eight-year-old penman, in other words, a person who makes his living by writing documents for other people using elaborate, artistic penmanship. To add interest to this theme, the book takes place at the same time that the first typewriters where being introduced into New England. As the book opens, Charles is still grieving the loss of his wife and son in a house fire four years earlier. Charles is a cultured, educated member of a vibrant emerging new middle class.The second main character is Lily Prescott, a beautiful, uninhibited, impulsive and passionate young woman who describes herself as a bird trapped in a gilded cage. She is a woman born to privilege, money, and high-society; however, not far beyond her teenage years, she finds herself completely on her own, having been thrust out into the world by a disapproving family because she had a brief affair with the working-class son of a family servant&#8212;an affair that resulted in the birth of a baby girl.Charles and Lilly come together when the young woman employs Charles to create an ornamental birth certificate for her infant daughter. Lilly is enchanted by the art of calligraphy and imagines that she might be able to learn the art and make a living through it. She reasons that since her family has disowned her, she needs a profession and being a calligrapher appeals to her. She hires Charles to teach her.The plot is complicated by a local murder mystery and many different plot threads, all revolving around the complexity and difficulty of being a woman in this period. These themes include wife abuse, postpartum depression, mental and physical exhaustion, hysteria, and madness.Read the book if you enjoy becoming part of a different historical period. In particular, read the book if you are interested in the early history of New Haven. The author excels at creating an authentic period piece. The plot is a lovely light Victorian romance combined with an ancillary murder mystery that aids the overall plot development more than it provides any kind of suspense or complexity of clues. The prose is effective and skillful. Both the male and the female characterizations ring true and authentic.
$SUMMARY.: Fascinating characters in an authentic historical mid-19th-century New England setting

$REVIEW.: Wise Men SayEmmy is in love with a dead man. According to her sister anyway. Her fiancee has been missing in action for 20 years. Something inside her makes her believe that he is still out there and until they bring her his body, he will stay alive in her heart. Her son now in the military himself, helps her when he can. She couldn't be more proud. She misses him daily and cries often for his return, even after 20 years. She has never given up hope. He was the love of her life and she pushes on and has fun with her niece but waits for his return.Even though this one was short. Talk about a build up. You know who is gonna show and about what is going to happen but I still cried. Miss Burke gets you to feel what and how intense Emmy's love is for him. This is one book I really wish had been longer. Even though I really enjoyed it, Miss Burke could have made this one into a full book. Going through Emmy's life and showing there love through remembering. Showing bits and pieces of his life, what he goes through and what he remembers and thinks about at the worst of times. I would read that book in a heartbeat. I would watch that movie in a heartbeat! So I did really enjoy this book, but I wanted more from this book. I would read this author again in a anytime!complimentary book given for a free review. juliesbookreview.blogspot.com

$review_text.: 57 hours after the birth of their third child, a son, John and Ricky Ryrie are thrown into the grief process.  Surprising is to learn that Ricky (the mother) knew in the 5th month of her pregnancy that this infant would probably not live very long after his birth.  He had a difficulty with his brain and he would not be able to sustain life for very long outside of the womb.  She chose not to share this information with anyone, including her husband, the father of this boy.The book is how this couple who were already having a troubled marriage, and their two children, Biscuit and Paul come to terms not only with the death of this baby but also the secrets kept by their mother.Additionally there is the character Jess, who is John's grown daughter from a former relationship.  She longs to be valued in this family and made to feel special during a period when John and Ricky are already going through so much.If you enjoy books about relationships and family you will enjoy this well-written book.  I heartily recommend it with that perspective in mind.

$review_text.: I have a confession. I like planning for every detail. I always need to know the specifics before doing it. I remember a few times in my life when planning didn't do well for me. God always let me know whether or not I was doing it wrong or it wasn't His plan.Over the last few years, God has been pushing me back onto His path, and not letting me make my own path. I have been in deep valleys and hanging off a few cliffs (of course not literal cliffs). I can see a few years back when I thought I was going to tutor a 3rd grader and made up this curriculum for him and I ended up with a 6th grader that was homeschooled.I was a bit nervous when I tutored him, but God gave me the resources to go on and I ended up doing more than succeeding. Even this year, I had a great plan in my mind. I was going to finish college, get my teacher licensure and teach in public school next year.Appearently, Satan wouldn't let me finish my plan but God had His own plan. I don't know what it is yet, but He will let me know.Just like Katie and Johnny's situation. Because of strayed paths, they both were going to split. God had a better plan for them, but they didn't see it until they stepped back and let God take the lead.Even though God is in the lead, I realize I should let Him lead me, instead of planning for my future life.Here's a little synopsis of the book:Everything changed between them the first time he called her Katie.Katherine Yoder has loved Johnny Mullet since they were children, but he never actively returned her affections. Like so many things in their world, he assumes Katherine will always be there. Once his horse farm is a success, then he will court her in earnest.For several weeks, Katherine has been plagued by severe headaches and dizziness. While resting at home, Johnny unexpectedly visits, but when dizziness strikes, she loses consciousness. She awakens hours later in a hospital bed, unable to remember how she got there.Seeing Katherine injured and vulnerable stirs something in Johnny, and his guilt compels him to spend time with her while she heals. Soon his heart begins to stir with questions: Does she even remember why he'd come to her house that day?As Katherine struggles to recall recent memories of Johnny, a surprise visitor arrives in her already unsteady world--a man named Isaac who claims they had been writing letters to each other, even considering marriage, before her illness.With two men vying for her attention and her memory still elusive, Katherine has never felt so divided. The answer may lie behind a door she never considered opening.

Reading about what the princes have accomplished and how they have flourished and floundered in the years since their mother's death was informative.  I hadn't realized Prince Harry took almost a 2 year gap "year".  The royal girlfriends (and now wife) certainly have a hard path.  I certainly didn't realize their military training was so rigorous and intense.  It truly is their career at this point in their lives.

I was pulled into the story immediately and just couldn't put it down!  Lunabel was a charming main character--strong, stubborn, and unafraid!  Jeremy was perfect...a gentleman, supportive, caring, very protective, old and young alike.  And Jelly.  Now, she was a pleasant surprise in this read!  Everyone needs a friend like her.  The Thornhill sisters were so charming...I know I want more of them.  There is much more to learn of their story, too!  I look forward to the continuing series, no matter how fanciful--talking trees, fairies, magic and music `mesmerization'... and extraordinary characters that bring out the best in Lunabel!  I wouldn't change a thing about this book.  Very well written and trust me, if I love it--a person who isn't really into the fantasy genre--everyone will love it!  Congratulations, Marik Berghs!  I'm anxious for the next adventures in Lunabel's life!  Bring on the next book!

$review_text.: I read this one through in one sitting. There are three in this series and I have the feeling that they need to be read in order not just as independant books. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this was not it. Some author's have an ability to bring the most unlikely of characters together and this no exception to that concept. The character's, here, have enough age and experiencebehind them to bring a lot of baggage with them but both need to try and find something that they either have lost along the way or have been deprived of due to the circumstances they find themselfs in. The writing is tight and the character's are well developed.Mysteries are started here that one hopes will be addressed in subcequint volumnes. It leaves the reader with unanswered questions wishing for more. It is much more than just a m/m love story. It will captivate your attention from the first sentence. It could be one of the most intriguing first lines that you'll run across these days. What a way to start!  Roy Evans  author of 'Yosemite Fire&#34;

$REVIEW.: Having loved the series of LWD I was hoping for good things from the book. I suppose after the lack lustre LWR book I should have know what to expect! This is sadly like the first book, slow paced, not especially descriptive, a touch dry and focusing more on the petty tensions and frustrations than the actual journey. Funnily enough you didn't get a feel for the tension from the TV series, but this book really focuses upon them. Charley has a habit of name dropping all the sponsors and equipment providers, which although I know they have to acknowledge, the body of the text isn't the best place to do so. One redeeming factor is the various colour plate sections which show the journey in quite a good light and the maps are up to a good standard also. It seems like a great adventure and the TV series showed that aspect really well, the book on the other hand is a little dry. Worth it if you're a big fan of the series, other wise you can give it a miss and not worry too much.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

Without any spoilers, let's see what I can do.Jordan lives in the nut-hatch, and has a life-long obsession with Zombies. Sounds like a pretty good recipe so far, right? Oh, it gets even better!Jordan has run countless Zombie drills in preparation for the Zombie Apocalypse, so when the Zombies make their appearance, Jordan is ready to rock and roll.Jordan is constantly being forked by the fickle finger of Fate as the Zombie Apocalypse progresses, but with steadfast determination..... Ummm, okay, let me be honest. It isn't steadfast determination that keeps Jordan going, CRAZINESS is the fuel that fires Jordan's cylinders!As more stress is piled onto the already unstable structure of Jordan's mind, and the truth about the origin of the Zombies is made clear, Jordan begins to lose all semblance of sanity, and we get a deep, dark glimpse of Jordan's Brains!I have never read a Zombie tale like this one. It was a roller-coaster ride of fun, fear, and flat-out lunacy. I recommend this book for any ages between twelve and the coffin.This is NOT your every day tale of shambling corpses.

Char, who was cheated on by her ex with her best friend, is hesitant to trust a man, and Riley fights to prove that he is worth taking a chance on.  Overall an okay read.  There were grammatical errors that had me shaking my head several times, but didn't detract too much from the overall story.  Was a pretty light and easy read.

$REVIEW.: I am an avid reader, have been since learning to read as a young child


I must say this book is among the top 10 books I have ever read


I think it would appeal to a variety of people

Ms

George writes in such a way that I could picture her surroundings, the people she encountered, and most importantly I was drawn into her feelings on her journey to sobriety

I actually had a hard time making myself put the book down
And when I read the last page, I wanted there to be more
I also can relate to many of the issues she had in her life, which made her story that much more compelling to me

If you think this is a book just about "getting clean", please do yourself a favor and read the book..I don't think you will be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: Another Amazing Book from Ker Dukey&#8230;..Also, another book with absolutely excellent ratings and reviews on every book site..So, before I read it, I again had high expectations from the book and well the author...And she does not disappoint!My Soul&#8217;s Keeper is an original, great story with a whirlwind of events, emotions, characters. It has a great flow and that enables Ker&#8217;s creativity to fully develop and give us all these events and various situations our characters get themselves into. When the author decides to insert so many events in only one book, you can imagine that chaos can appear, but not in this one..Everything is just excellent..The characters are consistent to themselves..They are the same in the beginning and the end of the book, which I really liked. I love it, when they stay true to their form...They are really great characters and it&#8217;s clear that Ker put lots of thought in them..They are very well developed and oh well quite adorable, even in a paranormal book&#8230;And I never thought I&#8217;d say this, but ...Death is pretty cool&#8230;.Awesome,in fact&#8230;You have probably figured it out, but I loved the book!! I really did..But there were some few things I didn&#8217;t like..And I didn&#8217;t like them, because they all happened in one book and it seemed to me a little too much. If this book was 2 books, then I would say that everything is 100% perfect..And I can&#8217;t tell you much more, because I&#8217;d give you a huge spoiler and I don&#8217;t want to do that...However, this is an honest review, as always, so I believe I had to write this small comment..Otherwise, My Soul&#8217;s Keeper is an incredible book, full of romance and action, sexiness and love..Most of all, Love&#8230;..Sooo, Ker you receive a Huge 5-Star Review with all my love!

I had to spit out some chicken the other day, realizing it was just some dead muscle. I can hear Pigs screaming when I try to eat pork.

$review_text.: An archeological find in the Ethiopian desert turns into a discovery with global implications in this fast-paced and engaging novel.  What I thought would be a historical conspiracy-theory turned into an apocalyptic prophecy involving time travel.  But it worked.  I thought Niko did a great job weaving the story of ancient Ethiopian Coptics with the future environmental decline of the planet.  What archeologist Sarah Weston finds in a desolate cave leads her to a controversial plot with a science fiction twist.  History and science collide when she realizes the origins of the ancient wall carvings she discovered are a vision of a future catastrophe.  Sounds obscure and slightly far-fetched, right?  The book evolved into an entirely different story that I had initially expected, and I was pleasantly surprised at the turn of events that made this book an original adventure.I received a complimentary copy of this book via Historical Fiction Virtual Book Tours.

$review_text.: It was a cute story of a librarian who had been straight laced in her normal every day life, but wrote a blog where she became the Naughty Librarian that liked spankings
 She writes about her adventures on her blog, although they are all made up because she has never experienced a man to take her in hand
Glennys writes about Carlos, giving her spankings, but she has never confided in him that she is interested

 She falls in love with Carlos and he finds her blog and the two of them play out what she has written


 I liked that Carlos and Glennys were a cute couple
 He seemed to understand her and her needs
 They did meet at a &#8220;club that caters to doms and subs&#8221;, even if it was only a trial tour to see if it was their style
 The story is light with lots of fantasy scenes and plenty of spankings
 Toward the end of the story they become more of a domestic discipline couple

 But the story is light, with lots of spankings, and sex

 I would have liked to see more of their early dates and such, not just the end when they became a quick husband and wife
 It was a cute fast read

$review_text.: Pizzicato, by Rusalka Reh, was first published in German in 2009 (as Pizzicato oder die Entf&uuml;hrung der Wundergeige).  This is AmazonCrossing's first try at the young adult category.  AmazonCrossing seeks out works from around the world and has them translated into English.  Two more Reh works are in the pipeline:  "Das Geheimnis des Wasserritters" and "Mini und die Spioninnen."I have mixed feelings about this story.  In my opinion, and you may not agree with me, if one is going to the trouble of translating a story, I expect one of two things:  a story of such quality that it is universally great; or a story that is perhaps not so good, but that provides deep insight into the culture of origin.  As much as I welcome AmazonCrossing's foray into this genre, I'm not sure Pizzicato hits the mark on either one.Pizzicato is a short story about a boy, Darius, who is a tad slow upstairs and, frankly, a tad dull.  Darius can be deep, but he doesn't have much to show for it.  Even as we root for Darius, I don't think many readers will identify with him.  So we read this with a bit of detachment, a feeling that this is all a bit strange.  Contributing to this is a sense of improbability, not about the magic violin, but about the entire plot setup that sees an orphan transferred to the care of a near stranger for a three-week school assignment based on a verbal agreement.  Does this really happen in Germany?  There must be some paperwork, some official vetting.  Call me ignorant, but I'm not sure where the fiction ends and life in Germany begins.That said, I enjoyed the various relationships in the book as well as Reh's powers of description.  I found the antagonists, a mother-and-son con team to be the most fun:  a controlling mother who calls her son "bunny."  I want a story just about them!  The orphanage, which we see principally at the beginning, is rich with complicated interactions, but we leave that setting too soon.  In all, I find Reh to be a very capable author, but the most intriguing aspects of Pizzicato exist at the borders of an otherwise bland main character.
$review_summary.: I like the author; I have mixed feelings about this story.

$REVIEW.: This is a fantastic book and a vital resource for both students and experienced cognitive-behavioural therapists. The book is fully comprised of comprehensive CBT techniques spanning from simply identifying automatic thoughts to challenging and modifying schemas. The book also offers useful information to guide the reader in selecting which techniques to use and for what issue.The CBT techniques all contain a summary explanation, how the technique should be used, what the therapist should say verbatim when using the technique and remedies for common problems encountered with the technique.The book's best asset is the use of case scenarios for each technique, which contain therapist/client dialogue. These small examples offer excellent ways to deliver the technique to the client verbatim. I think this is a wondeful book and a must-have for anyone engaged in counselling or practising CBT.

$review_text.: What happens when one woman falls for her three bosses? Love!Kellan Kent, Eric Cohen and Tate Baxter are lawyers, best friends and in love with the same woman, Annabelle (Belle) Wright, who just happens to be their secretary


They&#8217;ve loved her for over a year but have awaited the right moment to claim her

But Belle has a secret.Kellen is the strong, alpha dominant of the three men but he&#8217;s also the one with the most to overcome

There were times through the story that I wanted to shake some sense into him, he made me so mad.Tate is the nerd of the group and the one that steals the entire story


I&#8217;m usually one that falls for the strong, commanding, controlled guy but the geek did it for me
I rooted for Tate throughout the entire book.&#8220;I&#8217;m going to do it

I&#8217;m going to offer her my penis.&#8221;Eric&#8217;s head hit the table and he groaned


&#8220;Dude, how do you ever get laid?&#8221;So he wasn&#8217;t smooth
At least he was honest

&#8220;She already has my heart

I would like for her to take my penis, too
Is that so much to ask?&#8221;Eric is the glue that holds them together


He is funny yet serious when he needs to be.Shortly after coming to work for them all three knew that Belle was the one to make their lives complete


Though Kellen fought his feelings tooth and nail


I loved the way Belle fought for what she wanted and didn&#8217;t give up

She was the one to heal their damaged hearts like they were the one to heal hers.I laughed, cried and cussed my way through this book
While I have loved all the Masters of Menage books this is by far my favorite
From the well written plot, to the fascinating characters, to the amazing and steamy sex scenes


I waited long time for this story and Ms
Blake and Ms

Black truly did not disappoint

If you want to sit back with a fun, sassy, sexy story Their Virgin Secretary is the one for you!

$REVIEW.: Journey of Awakening is not the usual romantic fare from Carina Press. Though there is a touch of romance, it is not the main focus of the story. Rather this is a traditional fantasy, a story of a young woman finding her strength and the path she must follow to fulfil her destiny.Sara is an orphan raised by her grandfather for one task, to return the ancient stone she wears around her neck to its rightful owners and to reunite it with its two companion stones. When the three stones are together again, peace will return to the land. The land in question is the mainland across the ocean from the island Sara grew up in. When she thinks she is ready to begin her quest, she sets sail with her grandfather, but only she makes it to the mainland alive.Lost and alone, Sara is lucky to be taken in by a kind woman and when Sara realises that she must move on. Her husband takes her to her next stop, a healer further inland. From there, after practicing her healing arts, she travels again and meets a race of nomads who live on a plain. She falls in love with their handsome and charismatic leader and becomes embroiled in their politics when his son is kidnapped.Over all, the story is one of meeting wonderful people, then leaving or loosing them and having to move on again. There is a deep sadness in the book, the kind of heaviness you often find in traditional fantasies, and the only light to penetrate this darkness is the nobility of Sara's mentors and her own desire to do what is right. Without this enlightened vision of solving problems without falling into obvious, and violent, solutions, the book would have little to set it apart from the many other books in this style.The characters, apart from the red man who stays on the fringes for this book, are extremely well drawn, and the relationships and motivations of the characters very realistic. The elegant prose is also an enjoyable aspect of the book.It is a good story with a well-paced solid plot and the right balance of description, action and character development, but it is the wisdom in Sara and her mentor's approach to life that gives this book not only light, but also life.I received this book free from the publisher in return for an honest review.

 The murder cover-ups are clever, the settings a rich mix of southern California and Arizona, and the narrative fast-paced

$REVIEW.: For long time fans of Amish fiction, its easy to see why Wanda Brunstetter is a New York Times best selling author and considered a "founder" of this genre.  With close to 50 books and over 5 million copies sold, Wanda has definitely captured the hearts of her readers.The Healing is the second book in the Kentucky Brothers series and continues the story of Samuel Fisher who has recently lost his wife.  Left alone to raise his children, Samuel is emotionally numb, overcome with grief and basically going through the motions.  He distances himself from his children and his family around him and seems to be intent on pushing away those that love him and want to help him.  Samuel is so caught up with his own loss, that he doesn't recognize his children are grieving too.Samuel's brother, Titus Fisher, takes in Samuel and his children with the hopes of giving them all a fresh start.  However, Titus's good intentions quickly begin to go awry and the complications of taking in family start to strain Titus's relationship with his fiance'.This book has many characters from the previous book, so I do suggest reading the series in order if you want to have a good understanding of the family history and dynamics.Overall, this is a book about the struggles families face when they experience the tragedy of losing a loved one and how everyone processes grief differently.The third book in this series (The Struggle) is due out fall of 2012.
$SUMMARY.: Another great read for fans of Amish Fiction

$review_text.: Sometime ago a lovely lady contacted us wanting to know if we would be interested in taking a look at the novel she was working on.  After reading the synopsis I was completely sold hook, line and sinker!  It looked absolutely AMAZING and I was dying to get my eyes on it ;-)  Irreparably Broken by K J Bell,  is everything I hoped it would be and so much more.... FABULOUS read!  An angst filled, full of sexy hotness, raw love story.  It was everything I look for in a read.  It pulled me in and I couldn't put it down until I was finished (except when work got in the way, damn day job!!).  I was completely consumed by the story and the characters, it was all I could think about.  I had one helluva book hangover after I finished  because I wasn't ready for it end!  I promise I will never look at a tissue the same way again &lt;3 &lt;3LOVED LOVED LOVED the characters that K J Bell has created!  Victoria (Tori) is very guarded, having been hurt in the past.  She whole heartedly cares for those she loves.  Her heart knows what it wants but her head isn't sure.  Liv is every girl's best friend.  She's caring and funny (she 's absolutely hilarious) and loves her family and friends with all she's got.  Tug is BRILLIANT, I loved him!  Sexy and sweet., he loves Tori wholeheartedly but knows that she thinks of him as a brother, or does she ;-)  I absolutely LOVED the banter between Tug and Tori, it was so realistic and completely hysterical.  I dare you not to fall for this funny, sexy man.  Then there's Brady *swoons* this sexy tormented man amazed me.  I felt as conflicted as Tori when it came to Brady! There is so much to his story that you can't help but fall completely head over heels for him,  he had my heart aching.  Finally there's Harrison.  Loved Harrison's character because he made me so mad, I wanted him to stop interfering in where I wanted the story to go!  My fingers are crossed that K J Bell gives us some more of these brilliant characters as I feel some of their stories still need to be told (hope she feels the same way, hint hint).This riveting angsty love story, took me on one heck of an emotional roller coaster.  The conflict that the characters were going through was so real and raw.  Then there are the OH EM GEEEE moments in the storyline!!!!  So many unexpected twists and turns that had me picking my jaw up off the ground.  Just when I thought that I had all figured out... Nope, not even close.  Looking for something hot to read??  Irreparably Broken is full of sexy steamy passion *fans self*.  The love scenes are hot, sexy and tastefully written.  Might want to check your blood pressure while reading this one, LOL!  What is it about rainy nights ;-) Honestly, for me, Irreparably Broken is the whole package!!  Congrats K J Bell for an absolutely amazing debut, you ROCKED it Girl!NicFlirty and Dirty Book Blog

$REVIEW.: The second novel in the paranormal m/m erotic romance series Ariel Estates is an intriguing hot and steamy read.Lion shifter and Secretary of Ariel Estates, Eli Novak is torn and confused, he&#8217;s always been straight until a strawberry blond human male stumbles onto their land and has him questioning everything he thought he knew about himself.  Lost in the Smokey Mountains, Shayne Matthews sees a light in the distance that he thinks might lead to rescue but instead he ends up in a world he never knew existed.  Fear turns to lust and an adventure that puts him in the middle of a battle for dominance and power.  Forced into a triangle of options, Eli must choose between his best friend, the human who&#8217;s claimed his heart and the pride&#8217;s best interest.This fast paced and smooth flowing plot keeps the reader on their toes with suspense and romance. The author brings the story and the characters to life with vivid imagery that makes the reader feel as if they are part of the story. The strong compelling characters grab the reader&#8217;s attention and doesn&#8217;t let go, ensuring that the reader wants to know more.The forbidden attraction between Eli and Shayne explodes with passion and the blazing hot sex scenes leave the reader scorched.  Relationships between shifters and humans being forbidden adds spice to their rocky relationship keeping the reader engrossed in the outcome.The tension building suspense created by a greedy and revenge seeking shifters adds lots of depth and action to this already entertaining story.  I love the shifters of Ariel Estates and I can&#8217;t wait to about of them.

$REVIEW.: The premise of Kill the Story is superb! I especially enjoyed it because I have spent years working in public relations and have a sort of love/hate relationship with journalists. And, I started out in television, doing what is sometimes referred to by the oxymoron 'broadcast journalism,' so I was once myself filled with the self-importance that masquerades as commitment to the public's right to know.Author John Luciew must have been a journalist at one point in his life, as he totally gets the delusion that takes place on both sides of the microphone.The plot of this captivating little novel is relayed elsewhere, so I will skip the summary. Suffice to say that this is a true page-turner. But more than that, Luciew has created some very believable, and likeable, characters. All are flawed, but all are human and easily identified with. This guy has real talent, which I respect greatly because I think it's difficult to write a novel that is both entertaining and intelligent.The bonus is that this is available in Kindle edition for just $3.99 and, I believe, free if you own a Kindle and download the book to your device. Since I read e-books using Kindle software but do so on a Mac, I had to pay, but that is a small price for big entertainment.Bottom line: If you like detective/crime novels, this is one you won't want to miss.
$SUMMARY.: Must read if you've even been near the media biz

$REVIEW.: This is a wonderful love story between two Amish youth and the journey the take on their way to making their dreams come true.  It's the third in the "Daughters of Promise" series by Beth Wiseman.  While Miriam and Saul's journey is interesting, I was more touched by the perfect love exhibited by Miriam's parents, Aaron and Rebecca towards their only daughter.  To love one's child unconditionally...every parent's desire.  Also interesting in the book is the arrival and stay of the English girl, Shelby.  I hope that Shelby's love story is told in the next novel - if there is a next novel, and, Beth Wiseman, I hope that there will be!  I definitely will recommend this to my friends and hope that our library system purchases it.  We have quite a number of readers who love Wiseman and many of the other authors of Amish families.

$review_text.: This book is a RAPID-FIRE series of substantiated indictments of the former First Lady.  It seemed like every word was annotated or referenced.  There are around 12 "exhibits" (over 150 pages of documents, forms and letters that verify claims in the book ... gov't forms and legal docs are quite long) and another 8 pages of notes in the back to drive home the message. It's easy to read and stay engaged with this book. One has no doubt as to where the author and book stand on the issue of Mrs. Clinton. The tone of each (short) section consistently frowns on the documented, proven, indisputable, yet ostensibly still "questionable" actions of Mrs. Clinton. You end up shaking your head and wondering how someone could get away with so much. That said, the title is correct in saying that this is a (VWRC-style) dossier. The actions in question are documented and/or explained, then part of the time the author goes an extra step to lambaste the former First Lady or sneer in Mrs. Clinton's general direction.  I never said this was Adam Smith...I don't like mean-spirited content, and this book tested me very little.  I find Carpenter's book to be as witty as Coulter columns, but a little less snippy. I didn't find that the "non-fact" opinions that occasionally followed a topic detracted from my experience.  In some cases, I beat her to the punchline in my mind, and thus felt quite involved in the book.  It probably deserves 4-1/2 stars for keeping the reader's attention, but I can't inflate this book at all due to the seriousness of the issues at hand.  Normally, reader-engagement is integral to the quality of a book, but in this review, the focus is roundly on the ideas expressed within, not whether Ms. Carpenter is yet on par with Hemingway.I have found most politicians to sometimes be disingenuous and/or guarded, but anyone who replies to questions in court or before congress with, "I don't know" over 250 times is exceptionally shady.  If you read nothing else into this, let it be, "Mrs. Clinton is exceptionally shady."  Once you know *how shady*, it'll be up to you to decide if she's fit to hold office in the greatest nation the world has ever known.  There is no doubt that Mrs. Clinton was involved in a campaign finance violation for which her fund-raising committee was fined $35K ... BUT ... the committee in question has already spent the money, and now only has a couple thousand dollars. It looks like they'll default on the judgment ... slick, huh?  You'll be surprised at just how slick the Clinton's are according to this book. Everything under the sun is fair game to them, and thus to this author, including:* Hard and Soft money discrepancies in campaign funding* Co-mingling of funds between spouses, one of whom has taken money ($16+ million) from foreign powers* Power-brokering to the elite, foreign and domestic* Pork barrel politics, including "earmarking" $120 million for "first responders" in NY from the money set aside for Hurricane Katrina victims (now who "doesn't care about black people", Mr. Kanye West?)* Abominable national security ideas, including conflicting ones on identification cards and issuance of VISAs.* Illegal immigration will be a thing of the past, b/c there will be no such thing as "illegal" immigration.* National health care will be a boon to the poor, and a burden on the rest of us. Hillary hasn't given up on nationalizing our healthcare system. She only opposed Bush's prescription plan because it wasn't "comprehensive" enough.* [excellent exchange between HC and Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA)] She believes that "less than perfect" fetuses should be treated differently under the law than "perfect, healthy" fetuses. Anyone seen the movie "Gattica"?* She voted against our current Chief Justice Brown citing no reason other than politics.  Can you believe turning away a stellar nominee b/c he wasn't your idea...petty behavior, and beneath the standards of the American people, I say.* She is afraid to speak to the press, and rarely grants "hallway interviews" like so many other Senators, and indeed public figures at large, who know communicating with the press and the public is part of their job.I could go on for ages. This woman is disgraced as a First Lady, a failure as a lawyer, a failure as a healthcare reformer, and a hired gun for NY corporations (like Corning, Inc.) and NY municipalities. Her personal fortune is of more than questionable origin, and she undoubtedly will run for President starting after the mid-terms in November of this year. America is smart enough to read the facts here and elsewhere, and make it's own decision.  If nothing else, just follow the money trail in this book.  Ask yourself if it's good, right, just and fair that she succeed in another "slick" maneuver.  Do you want children who grow up to be "just like her"? Don't just get your news from NPR and the NY Times, read Carpenter's sources. Read the Wall Street Journal. Watch Mrs. Clinton on TV, and ask yourself if she looks like she's being forthright. This is a good place to start looking at details. This is not the "end-all" indictment of Mrs. Clinton, but it lists a lot of heavy hitters. Read it, and I trust you will be stunned at how deep the rabbit hole goes, as I was.

While it does have a lot of interesting ways this family survived the Depression I know there are books out there that are filled with better accounts.

$review_text.: This wolf shape shifter story is very engaging but has a cliff hanger ending.  Rating 4.5.Evie was always a restless child and discovered a great passion for running at an early age. She lived with her widowed mother in Alabama and especially loved her summer and occasional winter visits to her grandparents' farm in the North Woods of New Hampshire. There she would run on dirt roads between cornfields and on trails through the woods. She would dream of running and then one night, as she was nearing her seventeenth birthday, she dreamt of familiar northern paths where she found herself running in wild freedom, faster than ever before, with a steady heartbeat of joy.Evie has shifted to her wolf self without ever knowing of her history. Her mother immediately takes the feverish young woman to her grandfather and the pack. Suddenly Evie is not just the newest wolf, but a white wolf from the legendary leaders of the pack. This brings a response of jealousy from some but mostly joy in a pack that cherishes family and strengths. Evie faces a crash course in learning as she is ignorant of the pack ways, history and dangers. Her new world is complicated by outsiders too. There is a cougar pack that has had an old rivalry with the wolves. They tended to remain off on their own but the news of a new white wolf has brought them in to attack.Evie is struggling to take in the fact that she is a wolf shifter, there are other shifters, and there are human &#8216;rats&#8217; that sneak and spy. She is also trying to assert her reasoning, human will to control the wild wolf instinct that flashes forth causing concern and danger for herself and her friends. But she is young, foolish and quickly gets into trouble. While facing the dangers of control and marauding cats, Evie and her pack also have to remember to maintain a low profile so humans do not suspect strangeness in their midst.This story jumps into a good steady pace and is wonderfully portrayed from the view of the young protagonist who is frightened, confused, a bit angry and yet thrilled at her new world. Evie doesn&#8217;t realize how special she is so she is not arrogant in her unique blood lines but she also is totally a reckless teenager. The character is fittingly developed as are others of the pack - relatives and friends. The reader gets the emotional impact of the teen fitting into a family dynamic, as well as wonderful descriptions of enhanced senses.There is plenty of good action and I was well engrossed in the story when it hit a cliff hanger end! It was an &#8220;Aargh&#8221; moment because I didn&#8217;t want the adventure to end but I really didn&#8217;t want it to end in such a dangerous, unresolved situation! I recommend this story to those who like action and the family dynamic of shifter packs. Just be forewarned that you may want to have the second book handy.

$REVIEW.: The synopsis of this book recommended you read the first in the series to have a background on the characters and better understand the story but I wouldn't say that's true.  I did read the first book but it was awhile ago so of course don't remember what happened.  Not remembering the first story didn't make this one hard to understand at all.That being said this was a fairly enjoyable, quick read.  I do remember I enjoyed the first book more and wasn't that crazy about all the drama in this book.  I do like drama and angst but not women who are constantly crying and Demi's hysterics got old pretty fast.  All the loose ends were tied up pretty neatly so I get the feeling there won't be a third book.

Loved that she was raw, sarcastic, cynical yet open & hopeful. A beautiful mess!I grew to love Evan. He was a haunted soul with an equally tormented past like Maise.Their love story was taboo, student/teacher affair. More moral than legal since Maise was 18. Their story's not typical though. It was intense, obsessive, unpredictable... captivating.Fell in love with Wesley & his mom, too. Maise was lucky she had them.I'm know I'm gushing but I can't help it!

$REVIEW.: Belinda Wilson is happy again to start on a major editorial piece as a freelance writer that could finally pay the bills again, live comfortably, and keep things in a mild perspective. She celebrates this new freelancing gig with Aidan and later meets with her girls at Redemption hot club spot to enjoy the festivities including the intriguing man, Vlad, takes Diana full-attention. Summer is the bad-freaky girl of the group with her tell-it-like-it-is mouthpiece. Diana well-educated and scientific tactics that she lives by but has a freaky-side that unleashes that keeps her girls wondering and guessing. Besides the small-talk, I enjoyed when Summer saw something tasty in the midst, singing Ashford and Simpson classic, Solid as a Rock chorus with her own sensual twist to it.Michelle J. Robinson unlocks a paranormal-mysterious erotic chick-lit that is beautiful, uniquely written that keeps you turning the pages, even though the chit-chatter and going through the motions with Belinda and her dear friends about careers, and men, and the astronomical murdering rate that's taking place in New York. Moreover, the title is best suited for this kind of story--and loving it. Her writing style intertwines a sexual-slave persona to the next plateau with a creepy, eerie feel to it.Be careful to have those lustful encounters and who you're friends are, and listen to those who know when evil is staring you directly in the face. Yet Dante showed more affection and care with Belinda regardless of his devious mission like his mentee Rene. Is there a sequel to this book? I commend Michelle Janine Robinson to write an erotic thriller with a paranormal twist and continue to write more books like this as the erotic scenes are not only tasteful but exploration at its peak. I'm a fan of these types of stories and keep me locked in when another one hits the stands.Dream 4 More Reviews has received "More than Meets the Eye" by the publicist Yona Deshommes from Atria Books/Simon and Schuster for a book review.Dream 4 More Reviews,Adrienna TurnerWooed Me Dream

$review_text.: Elle Michaels has written such a sweet story of love overcoming grief and sadness. Brooke and Tyler were characters that readers can very likely identify with, and having the alternating points of view added a level of interest to the story. I wanted just a little more back story about Brooke and Tyler's friendship and how it evolved into love, but I was thrilled that the main part of the story followed the love between Tyler and Brooke and how it helped them to overcome all of the obstacles that life threw their way. Tyler was such a great guy...pretty much the picture of a perfect boyfriend! At times, I loved this about him, but at other times I almost thought it bordered on making him seem less genuine. I really liked that the author provided closure and that all of the arcs in the story were wrapped up nicely. I loved that everything turned out well for Brooke and Tyler! If you're looking for a perfectly sweet book boyfriend and a happy ending, this book is for you!**I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review**

$review_text.: A man wakes up with amnesia.  From several of his unconscious, knee jerk, responses he dopes out that the man he was, wasn't a very nice character.  But even he is eventually surprised at just how un-good he was in his past life.  Along the way we encounter a lovely scion of a noble family, a squad of leaderless youths in need of training and a host of enemies at every turn.Circumstances and a faded and at times threadbare desire to... if not be a 'good' guy, at least be a half way 'decent' one casts Fox Crow into the mold of Champion and later (depending on how one looks at it) a hero.  For all of that this isn't a fairy tale of good deeds and cotton candy endings.  Gritty and unrelenting the story is a must read.The Deposed King

$REVIEW.: I loved this book!  It's been a while since I've read one that is this memorable, in both writing and storyline.  This was a wonderfully written story of redemption and survival of a strong young heroine.It was easy to connect with the female MC's backstory - one simple choice can change your whole life.  I particularly loved how the author balanced a strong, smart, young woman who tried to do what everyone else wanted her to do.  I think that society underestimates how much pressure is put on young women of this exact age to be perfect and to do what is good for everyone else to the detriment of herself. I understood how she struggled to connect with a new guy who was just persistent enough to capture her without being dominating. The male MC loved with his whole heart even with his own trust issues and that made him easy to love.I've read a lot of so-so books lately.  This book reminded me of what a great book with strong characters, a plot that moves you and a lot of angst can do.  You'll fall in love with this one.

$REVIEW.: Ticket to Tomorrow had me hooked from the moment the "bad" man bumped into the heroine's absent-minded-professor/inventor friend and business partner

I also love the cover, which perfectly resembles a young woman from that era


(I have a weird habit of looking at old photographs in antique shops, so I can assure you it has a definite authentic look.) Plus, my grandmother looked a lot like the cover model when she was young
I'm not kidding


Back to the story...What a great mystery! Just enough intrigue to keep the reader turning the pages, and enough dramatic tension to make the reader wonder when the antagonist is going to strike
The diabolical plan is revealed in snippets, but is never drawn out enough to give it all away...until the climax, of course

That makes it a perfect mystery, in my book
I hate a predictable story
The romance was...delectable
I loved it! How incredibly romantic! I loved how the hero kept wanting to steal kisses from the heroine
And he looked like the long-haired hunk in fringed leather from Dr


Quinn, Medicine Woman

Remember him? Admit it


He was the REAL reason you watched the show
Seriously, though, he was the ultimate hero

The whole story was very well done

In my opinion Ticket To Tomorrow is the perfect example of a historical romantic mystery


I know that isn't a genre, but if it were, Carol Cox would be the leading author


She led me to a different time and place in history and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it

I wish I hadn't waited several months to read it.

$review_text.: Revenge 4 by JJ Knight released early.  The Revenge series has had me hooked from the very first volume.  The plot is complicated, the characters are mysterious and all seem to have some kind of agenda, the &#8220;villain&#8221; or &#8220;bad guy&#8221; seems to be the record company, and all are leaning towards the goal of signing a record deal that could make a street busker an overnight superstar.  In the thick of all this action is a sizzling hot new romance between a nave girl working for the recording company and an intense soon to be rock star.  Their chemistry is through the roof.  Their relationship is an emotional rollercoaster.  Their affair is being manipulated.  One thing is very clear.  Jess, the nave girl, and Dylan, aka Brandon; the soon to be singing sensation, are falling in love.  This relationship may not survive the next play in this intricate game that is unfolding right before our eyes.Revelations are made.  Questions are somewhat answered.  These somewhat answers open up a whole new line of questions.  Some of the characters pasts are revealed, but not completely.Revenge 4 has taken this story into a new direction.  The theories I formed in the first three books have gone to the wind.  New theories are evolving.  Honestly, I think JJ Knight is going take readers to the edge in Revenge 5.  I think the readers are going to fall off the cliff and are going to be caught by a surprise ending.I cannot wait for the final book, Revenge 5. I need to get off this rollercoaster and catch my breath.I highly recommend the Revenge series by JJ Knight.  It is explosive!

$REVIEW.: Two of the great erotica writers who know what they're doing in one place! It was an instant buy for me.Nicole Snow delivers just like she always does. Her story has a hot Russian dom with a really possessive streak and a younger heroine leaving big problems back home. What to say? There's romance, danger and some wild wild sex with all the right tools. Enjoyed it a lot!Kelsey's story is a little more erotic than romantic. But like usual she shows us a shy nanny whose ready to be taken by a hard older man. They both got domination on the mind and YEAH there's more baby making too. The action really heats up when he takes her to bed and its hot and detailed.Great books. Both stories are longer than short erotica and makes it a good value for a buck.

In some of her books she gets a great combination of strong characters, intricate plot, some mystery, and well-done sensuality, and others she misses out completely.  --- this one is a good one.

$review_text.: Whoa, I'm not quite sure what to say about this book. It's definitely like no other that I've ever read."It's your darkness that pulls me in. Your mud vein. But sometimes having a mud vein will kill you."I need to say that I'm mostly a reader who enjoys joyful stories with a touch of angst but once in a while it's also good to have a story and/or ending that throws you off and leaves you saying to yourself "I can't believe it went down like that but bravo to the author for shaking things up".Anyway...love and coke. The consequences for both are expensive: you get a mighty fine high, then you come barreling down.Now let me be honest and say this is by no means a happy-go lucky, pot of gold at the end of the rainbow kind of book but I think that's why I liked it so much (on top of the amazing writing). It was different and every so often it's good to switch things up. I'll admit it was depressing so I can see how it might not be for everyone but the author piqued my interest from the very beginning and kept it till the end.Being stuck on love was a real b*tch to cure. Like cancer, I think. Just when you think you're over it, it comes back.Normally the lack of dialogue will irritate me which then causes me to give a book a low rating but it didn't bother me so much in this book. I think because I was too captivated to care and just wanted to see what was going to happen and how it was going to end whether virtuous or bad (of course I was wishing very hard for a cheerful moment). But I couldn't bring myself to give up on the main character, Senna."You can't fix me," I said, looking at his knees."I don't want to.""I'm mangled," I said. "On the inside and the outside."People might not develop an attachment to Senna because how emotionally unattached she is and how miserable she is but I grew to care about her. I, sort of, started to understand her. The turning point for me was when she realized her heart wasn't so frozen and that she was capable of caring and did care (or maybe it was sooner than that). She cared so much, she made a sacrifice.It's the silent moment when you hear the rushing of water in your eyes.But have no doubt your heart will both fill and shatter for Isaac:"When if I first opened my eyes and saw you standing over me, I felt like I took my first breath in three years."I give Tarryn Fisher a 5 whopping stars for her brilliant writing. This woman has a tremendous gift.

$REVIEW.: I already own the paperback versions of the Complete Sherlock Holmes, but when a free version was available for the Kindle, I couldn't pass it up. My four-star rating is not for the quality of the stories (which are wonderful, as always), but for the quality of the Kindle version. I was disappointed to see that it was missing the illustrations that are crucial to some of the stories (such as maps and stick figures that are clues). Instead of the illustrations, it just said something like [PICTURE] where they were supposed to be. This needs to be remedied.

$REVIEW.: 'Arianna Kelt and the Wizards of Skyhall' is a wonderful surprise - a book with the high action punch of Artemis Fowl and the zesty humor of Terry Pratchett. It has all the amazing attention to detail that made Harry Potter famous, complete with enchanting humor. I was rolling on the floor laughing every time the gnomes, and  Digorence in particular, made an appearance.As a first novel, it is not without its rough spots, but it is a delight to read. I see great things ahead for this young, 12-year-old author. This is without a doubt my favorite novel in years. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I'm breathlessly waiting for the sequel - and so will you when you read it.It should be noted this is a premium Coffee Table Size book that begins with an illustrated "Meet the Characters" section and ends with an "Illustrated Guide" to the world and its denizens. The front and back cover art is gorgeous as well. Kudos to JR King who created the original art in addition to writing the book! Quite an accomplishment for a 12-year old.

$review_text.: It may not be a bad thing that this book covers the CISSP objectives without practical applications (meaning, no real step-by-steps for implementing security within a given operating system or network environment). If you want to study for the CISSP exam and nothing more, this book is absolutely perfect. If you want a real-world guide to security tools and testing, I would recommend The CEH Prep Guide, bu Ronald Krutz instead. However, as a prep tool for the CISSP exam, I liked this book the best (out of three I reviewed). I particularly liked the way each chapter STARTED with unique terms covered in that chapter with their definitions. This made reading the chapters easier as you understood the author's intentions for those terms.

Well, WASN'T much of a mender. This little book gave me so many ideas that I actually don't mind mending as much. Not to say I love it, but honestly, the quality of my repairs is much higher and the fixes look cuter using ideas from this book. I really appreciate it since I taught myself everything I know about hand sewing, and I've gotten a lot of tips from the book.

$review_text.: On Goodreads, I saw the author's book trailer for this book. It showed images so compelling that I requested a free copy of the book directly from the author to read and give my honest opinion in exchange. After reading Chapter 1, I took the unusual step of contacting Author Christoph Fischer and sharing with him my interpretations of my reading.Let me explain: I was reading the book from a cultural standpoint, namely, from the personal perspective of actually having lived in various cities, towns and villages in Bavaria over a ten year period as a young adult. Consequently. I knew my reading was a misinterpretation of the author's intent.In other words, I wasn't reading the author, I was reading my own experience, comparing my life to what I found in the book, taking issue with minor language points, finding several cultural artifacts that were inconsistent with my lived experience of Germany in the 80's and 90's. For instance, I found several parallels with the autobiographical novel, "Herbstmilch" (Autumn Milk), by Anna Wimschneider (1985), and consciously began using that book as a frame of reference to guide me through Chapter 1. (yes, I'm an old guy if I was a young man in 1985) Anyway, Author Christoph Fischer assured me that he had seen the movie, "Herbstmilch" (it came out in 1988) a long time ago but could scarcely remember it.In sum, the author confirmed to me what I already knew: I wasn't reading his book. I was reading something entirely different. It was my personal response to having the opportunity to "return" to Germany through the magic transport medium of this book.Christoph kindly explained to me that the book was inspired by real people in his life, and specified who these people are and the distant relationship he had with them. It was therefore clear to me how the author had been able to write such convincing characters into this book, namely, they are born from his personal observations of real people, and brought to life powerfully in the roles he has assigned to each.I am in complete agreement with the author when he states the book is character driven. The characters drive this book forward, relentlessly. The book is not a cultural exposition, though it has cultural artifacts throughout the book. It is not the Munich Oktoberfest,On the contrary, it is real people, trying desperately to find out who they are, come to grips with the past, do the right things in the present, and somehow find a way to love themselves, with all their imperfections. In my opinion, this is not about redemption, its about loving yourself.Finally, this is an awesome book, very well written, with dynamic characters who continually surprise the reader. The characters are the key in this book. Stay close to them, and they will provide you with an opportunity to get to know yourself, based on how you react to them, and of course, the way they make you feel.One last note: Author Christoph Fischer is authentic. In this book you will find, besides memorable characters, the historical backdrop, a well structured plot, topics that make you reflect long after the reading is done, all of this, yes, but also you will find yourself "seeing", "hearing" and "smelling" the sights, sounds and smells of a bygone era in Germany. Fischer paints pictures in your mind in this book, with such talent and skill, that he is equal to the masters of the writing craft. He is amazing and it is a pleasure to read his author's "canvas"...This is a superbly exquisite book that I feel is a must-read. It is my absolute pleasure to give it my highest possible recommendation, 5 stars, and somehow feel sad that I could not give it more stars...Reviewed by Thomas Jerome BakerAuthor ofStory Tellers: In Pursuit of Happiness

$REVIEW.: I love it when a romance is exactly what it says it is. This is a new author for me, but I was immediately caught by the cover. What luck!Sometimes you want something heavy and full of intensity. Othertimes you want something that just makes you feel good.I grabbed this one based off the blurb saying it was exactly what I wanted today - a light, feel-good read. Now, don't take this to mean there's no drama or conflict. There ARE, it's just that the ending is so cute and sweet that the thing I'll remember about this book is how it made me smile at the end.Book is well written, well edited; didn't notice any weird plot holes or typos as I read. Looking forward to more from Ms Ashe!

$review_text.: I have been anticipating this text ever since I heard it was being worked on.Author Andy Mangeles does an incredible job in telling the story of Mr

Scheimer and Filmation studios

It is so good that one can almost hear Mr


Scheimer's voice as one reads.Filmation was one of the major animation studios of Saturday Morning Television in the sixties, seventies, and eighties
For me, the crown jewel of the series was their animated version of Star Trek, which was visually beautiful, well-written, and kept the Star Trek fires going between the original series and the movies.Other highlights include Fat Albert, the series created by Bill Cosby, based on his youth, which Filmation produced for over ten years on CBS and later in syndication


The birth of He-Man, one of the first weekday syndicated animated series, that set the shift from Saturday morning cartoons to the 65 episode run that we have today.I would recommend this book to tv historians, animation buffs, pop culture students, and many others


It also goes into great detail about the influence of unions, both pro and con during the fifties, sixties, and seventies
 The preface begins with the infamous story of Filmation pulling a "sharpie" to get National Periodical's rights to put out a Superman cartoon in the mid-sixties
Aided by the soon-to-be famous Ted Knight, Mr


Scheimer and his colleagues secured the rights, and while I confess I have heard the tale before, it is something that many tv and animation buffs should hear.From there, the narrative moves into Mr

Scheimer's Russian background, and that in itself could go off into another book, but it's wonderful to hear about where today's Americans comes from.There are incredible anecdotes here
Mr

Scheimer must have an incredible memory or has taken meticulous notes over the years.Things that caught my attention:**The Hardy Boys logo from the animated sixties


It certainly reflects the decade.**Titles of the Fall Network Saturday Morning Specials
Some of these annual productions may be lost, and must be found
Ahh
I remember when the big three networks took pride in what they produced, and tried to promote them
Since these specials featured network stars (in character) promoting cartoons, they would make great extras on certain DVD's.**While the Flash Gordon animated series is out on DVD, the full length animated version is not.**The presentation art of some proposed series is simply beautiful.**Never realized how much He-Man sounded like Reggie (from the sixties and seventies Archie series)

They should be, they're both voiced by John Irwin.**Outstanding stories on the wheeling and dealing of the tv industry, both good and bad
People who want to go into the entertainment business should look at what goes in this book.**While many of the Filmation TV series are out on DVD, there are still quite a few that aren't out yet


I hope they make it out.**Some great stories of Hollywood egos


Read about Uncle Croc's Block to hear about how Charles Nelson Reilly clashed with quite a few people.**It's fascinating how many of today's artists have fond memories of Filmation programs


Alex Ross, Frank Cho, Phil Jimenez have all done artwork on the universes created by Mr


Scheimer's studios.**Mr
Scheimer even remembers the Filmation artwork cells that were advertised by Starlog magazine
In the seventies and eighties, before there was ebay and the internet, this was one of the few ways to hear about and purchase animation art
That's all we had in the day.I have to give Mr


Scheimer credit, he did move heaven and earth to make sure his various series' didn't promote bad messages for children, but I'm not always sure how effective those lessons fit into the main story.Note: There are some adult stories in this book, but Mr.Scheimer gives a bit of warning before telling the tale so keep that in mind if one is telling this to younger audiences

One tale involving Forrest Tucker of Ghostbusters fame is an example of this.Andy held back on this book several times to include late material, and he must be given credit for making sure that this text was the best it could be.Lastly, this tome will keep you busy for many, many hours.JThreecarolyn@nemont.net

$REVIEW.: I received this book from NetGalley in return for an honest review.When Ethan Frost is first introduced in the book, he gives off the image of a laid back, down to earth, caring guy that also, just happens to be the CEO of Frost Industries. The same company Chloe just starts interning at. Their first meeting is a strained one. She doesn't like how he insists that she drink his smoothie instead of making her the one that she wants. She also doesn't think that they share the same views and ideas. Although, first impressions weren't the best, they both can't deny the chemistry sizzling between the two of them.Chloe has a lot of past that hasn't allowed her to move forward and trust someone. It has prevented her from getting close to anyone.Ethan protects what's his.This books pages were filled with a lot, it kept your eyes glued and never had a dull moment. It ended to soon! Such a huge cliffhanger! Now I have to wait till the next book comes out! I hope it's really soon!

$REVIEW.: Author: Lorilee CrakerGenre: Adult/Non-fiction/GeneralSeries: NoneDiscover the money-saving and wealth-building secrets of America's thriftiest people, the Amish.Author, journalist, and descendant of the Amish, Lorilee Craker, was just like the rest of us, feeling the pinch from the financial fallout of 2008. As a freelancer, her income was going the way of the dodo--family dollars seemed like an extinct myth, the bank account some archeological evidence of past prosperity.Then, inspired by a news segment covering her people, the Amish, and how they emerged from the economic crisis unscathed, she realized it was time to get back to her roots and learn a thing or two about their time-tested approach to personal finances. While the middle-class was wringing its hands over the family budget and the wealthy were weeping over their slashed portfolios, the Amish were content as always, spared from the cares of the world and worldliness. They not only had financial health to support their lives, they exuded a wholeness that eludes so many when the financial bottom drops out.In Money Secrets of the Amish, readers go on an "Amish money makeover," learning the choices, secrets, and disciplines that safeguarded the contentment and the coffers of America's favorite plain folk by spending less, saving more, and getting happier doing it.This book is written in a very cute style, with many money-saving tips. That's about all there is to say about it; if y0u're interested in being more economically independent, then I recommend this book. :)Ages: Any3 out of 5 stars

$REVIEW.: OK, SE Smith, pull on your writer's pants and LEARN TO WRITE. You have great stories to tell, but you fail on the technique.I struggled through all your spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors to read a story about some kick ass chicks. And when they were around anyone other than your heroes, they DID kick ass. Then they went all wimpy whenever one of the heroes pulled an 'alpha' male moment. Given that the 3 brothers lied to the heroines often, kept trying to separate and dominate each of them, what kind of idiot would trust them enough to be tied up by them? Bondage sex is a fun fantasy, but that kind of trust needs to be earned IN THE STORY where your reader can see it and go, 'hell yeah, I'd let him do that' instead of 'WTF is she thinking? He is SO gonna screw her over.' Plus, everyone is soooo surprised at 'women warriors' yet one entire species--one they were at war with and are now allied with--has female fighters. HUGE plot hole to go with the over-used and under-explained prophecy tropism to explain why they can't let the humans go back home. Insert eye roll and pained sigh here.Please, please, PLEASE find a good group of beta readers and an editor or two. It might take time, but your sales will go up so it will be worth it. Trust your reader on this and we will try to trust you enough to buy the next book you publish.

$REVIEW.: Wow, Denise was a piece of work. Be careful what you wish for you just might get it, even if the outcome is not what you hoped for. The lengths some people will go to for that almighty dollar even if it means hurting the ones you love is unbelievable. This book centers around four main characters Denise, Nadine, Jeff, and Greg. Denise has a good thing at home, but she wants that almighty dollar more than happiness. I don't want to give out too much information, but this is a very good read.  I rated this a 4 star only because I wanted to know more about Canvas and his sister.  It was nice that Jeff and Nadine named their child after him. I am so hoping that a book is written about Canvas and his sister. This is my first time reading anything by N'Tyse and I must say I was impressed. Great Job and I will be reading the follow up novel to this.

$review_text.: This is one of the more interesting of Lovesey's mysteries in that there are 3 senior detectives in 3 locales who, through circumstances, have to coordinate their investigations.  Two of them, Peter Diamond & Hen Mallin (The Circle), star in other Lovesey novels (mostly Diamond--e.g.The Vault).  They are both strong characters though Diamond has been deeply affected by the loss of his wife (in the priorDiamond Dust).  Part of the charm of this work lies in the interplay between these two talented detectives.  It also includes several supporting characters from other works such as Sergeant Stella Gregson on Mallin's staff & Ingeborg Smith (former newshound) & Keith Hallowell on Diamond's staff.  I find it both interesting and enjoyable that Lovesey includes capable women detectives in this novel as well as some others.  Indeed, Diamond himself is far less irascible (and IMHO more likable) in this novel than in most of his other ones.  Like his very warm performance inDIAMOND SOLITAIRE, Diamond again displays his sensitivity to children.The novel includes two main but related crimes which provide considerable interest and diversity to the book--in addition to the thoughtful characterizations of all of the detectives.  The crimes are both simple and complex in different ways, and the solutions match this paradoxical situation as well.  Overall the book is IMHO clever and enjoyable--one of Lovesey's best of the 16 I've read so far.

$REVIEW.: I felt Evan was going in bloody circles with his feelings while Matt was giving it his all. There were sexual practices but by the end of the book, the main characters don't even have sex(seriously?). This book focused more on the emotional side and was throwing in some physical contact just to keep it interesting. The ending was so disappointing cause it was so brief that they didn't even talk then it picks up right there in the next book. I kinda felt it was almost a cliff hanger cause technically they didn't solve anything and was still working things out at the end. Also I felt it was unnecessary to have POV's from the other characters .  However the writing was well written with no errors. Could of been heaps better!!!!!

$review_text.: Paul Miller's A Praying Life is simply a prayer guide for the majority of the modern church, most of whom do not have a regular time of communion with God

It is not a program, a method or a theological dissertation
Instead, Miller's approach is to aimed square at the heart of the Christ follower who has shied away from prayer because he believes that it is too hard or time consuming

He speaks from the heart of a harried, burdened Christian who also stumbles and teaches the reader that prayer is not simply an appointment to be kept
It is a way of life that can become as natural as breathing.Many in the Christian community keep themselves from prayer because they see the challenges as insurmountable

The literature on prayer is wide and deep, and depending on the books that you select, it is easy to become discouraged and turn away from the practice
Picking up Bounds, you look at your life and wonder how you would find hours per day to pray


Hybels sets out a formula (ACTS) that is perfect for some but constraining for others who attempt to steer the thoughts of their heart into the framework instead of pouring them out to God

Foster gives us 21 types of prayers, all biblical and wonderful but a challenge for the Christian to remember and apply on a daily basis
Each of the authors has enriched my life, but I find it difficult to recommend them to the majority of Christians I come in contact with.Miller takes a different approach to the privilege of prayer
He begins our discipleship in the art of prayer by turning us back to our childhood and encouraging us to speak to our heavenly Father in the same, open, unguarded fashion we once spoke to our earthly fathers

We didn't worry about form and just told him what was on our minds


Why would God be any different? Beginning in this way we learn to crave the time with Him, worrying less about content and simply develop a comfort in the moments spent together


Without this foundation, Christians find it difficult to develop a more mature approach to prayer.Prayer is hard, as is life as a child of God


Our Father says no, He has periods of silence that stretch for months on end and He can call us to obedience in ways that we wrestle against in resentment


It is easy for us to remember the chapters of the Bible in which prayer is immediately answered in a positive way, yet we are quick to forget the dark night in Gethsemane where the Lord cried out for His Father to take the cup from in but received a no in response

By intertwining experiences from his own life, Miller helps us to get over this hurdle that stops many Christians in their attempts to build a life of prayer


He shows that answers may not come, they may be no or that the answer may be several years separated from the supplication


The foundation that he built in the initial pages supports the broken heart of those disappointments and long winters of wait.Whether you posses shelves of books on prayer or are seeking a new start, A Praying Life is an outstanding book to include in your library
You will read it once and be immediately moved to read it again at a slower pace, seeing and considering the parallels between your own life and that of Mr
Miller's
This is prayer guide that should become a part of many church discipleship programs.

$REVIEW.: I'm genuinely surprised to say that A Poison Tree is my favorite book in the Time, Blood and Karma series (so far)
Not because I didn't think it would be good, but because I'd become attached to anti-ish hero David Braddock's life in Thailand


His life in an exotic locale as a private eye with a very sexy and complicated love life


I didn't particularly want to be brought back to his home in England or even to meet his wife - the one whose mysterious death he alludes to so often in the other books


I was wrong
What I found so compelling about this story was that I was introduced to a very different David Braddock
This David isn't as world weary or self-confident
He chafes under the thumb of his father's business empire, he's uncertain of the people around him, and he's happier
For all of its misunderstandings, conundrums and petty betrayals, family life actually suits David Braddock very well, and the loss of that structure is what informs the David of the previous books - Future David


Thailand David
The David that gains independence and a swagger at a horrible price.

I tend to just go with the star system but after reading the Jessica Brodie series I am changing my MO. This series is absolutely worth the money, the time and the read.  Her characters grow throughout the series and while Jessica is young and does some really stupid things, you find yourself as a reader her biggest cheerleader and supporter.  Don't just read this 1st one - go on a buy all three - you will not be able to resist following the story of Jessica and her friends as they grow into adult relationships and trials.

$review_text.: This sequel to the wild and zany Penelope took the zaniness to a whole new level.  This goes beyond normal levels of historic romantic comedy to slapstick funny.  Fair warning, right?  I happen to enjoy this brand of crazy when in the right mood.  It's a fun blend of regency romance, intrigue and a monstrous dose of comedy.  There were times I groaned over the too over the top stuff and other times I was snickering and then snorting.  Through it all, there was still a clear story line of a young girl in love with being in love who thought herself very sensible and had to learn that being sensible wasn't all that it was cracked up to be when it came to love.The story focuses on one of Penelope's younger half-sisters, Celine.  Getting Penelope's story first is best so that the characters and the situation makes sense.  Celine has been invited up to Town to take care of Penelope and her household during the last weeks of her lying in.  Celine has her own reasons for jumping at the opportunity and dragging her younger sister Dorothy and her governess along for the ride.  Celine plans to hunt down her less than dashing in appearance and less than stellar poet lover who has left the area and asked her to come and find him if she loves him.Celine's personal quest gets hijacked when the mischievous and dashing Lord Elmer is dropped in front of her on the Duke's carpet where the Duke's friend plans to leave the insensible man since he has to leave town and can no longer house him.  George, Lord Elmer, has lived an exciting life all in pursuit of his own pleasure and fun.  He now proposes to help Celine find her poet lover if she'll persuade her sister and the duke to let him stay since he's hiding from someone.  Celine isn't impressed with George's talents in stretching the truth, turning every female head, shirking responsibility and getting her into mischief, but more and more he is pushing her poor Philly out of her thoughts and replacing him with thoughts of George.  It's Philly she loves, right?  Between all the chicanery George and her relations kicks up, it takes her some time to arrive at her true wants.This one was so full of silliness that I wasn't sure if I'd find it the delight that Penelope was for me, but then I grew more engaged in the story when George and Celine began working together and something began between them. The story is told third person all from Celine's point of view.  It was neat seeing how Celine's experiences grew her and changed her thinking.  I also enjoyed the pop-in with Penelope and her duke though she was totally nuts because of her pregnancy and the intro to the younger sister Dorothy.As to recommendations...This is not a story or series for everyone.  One has to truly appreciate slap-stick blended with historical romance to enjoy this story.  For those who do, it is a fun reading experience that I heartily recommend.  Warning, you will laugh out loud so reading in public might not be a good idea if you're self-conscious about your laugh.My thanks to the author for providing my copy of the story in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: Okay, since this book reads like a short stream of consciousness, I should probably meet it directly and write a short stream-of-consciousness review."Gigantic Death Worm" by Vince Kramer is part of the New Bizarro Author Series, which means it is his first published book. This book is amateurish, juvenile, racially insensitive, and just downright stupid.At least, that's the first impression one gets. The thing is, as you read it, you become aware that it's written this way on purpose. This is not an amateur author. It's a talented writer pretending to be an amateur.And now my stream of consciousness just gave me A.D.D. and made me go look at Facebook. Okay, that's not working. Slow down a little. What's the book about?Dave is on a ski trip in Arizona with his friend Mike and Mike's girlfriend, Suzanne. Dave has brain parasites, or so he thinks. Turns out these little buggers are more than just parasites. Where did he get them? I'll leave that for you to find out. Trapped on a ski lift, they are attack by bears. Bears that spit wolves. Yes, bears that spit wolves. Some worms grow from the carcass of one these wolves and become the gigantic death worms of the title. This all ties into the Mayan calendar and the end of the world somehow. And then Mexican ninjas appear to help stop the worms. Mexican ninjas led by Ponce de Leon II: The Revenge.I am so not kidding.As I said, this story is written like it was done by an amateur, but Kramer is really a talented writer pretending to write like an amateur. He simply throws everything that he finds awesome, throws it in a blender, hits the puree switch, and actually manages to produce a taste little story shake. It's one of those stories that's just fun to read. There's no high-minded social commentary or metaphor here. It was the author sitting down and saying "Let me write something totally cool and awesome!"While short (a common thing with a lot of Bizarro books), the length feels right. Any longer and it probably would have felt like too much or could have dragged. My main complaint with the book is that it feels a little too diversionary at times. I really wonder what Vince Kramer could write in a longer format and if he toned down a little. But at the same time and at this length, diversionary isn't bad."Gigantic Death Worm" by Vince Kramer earns 4 tequila shots out of 5.

The plot felt like it was every where and no where and the cicle of people and the back and forth bringing in other sex partners was just horrible. I don't want to use strong words like hate- but Unsung just wasn't to my likely and I don't recomend this book to anyone!

$review_text.: BLOG: [...]All Of You is one of the best NA novels that I have read so far
I couldn't wait to get my grabby hands on it
 I mean, after reading the blurb I was sold
Who can resist a hottie, tattoo-artist, sweet hero who happens to be virgin?  Seriously, how many authors have done that before? I devoured the book in matter of hours.For the first time ever, I read a book where the roles are reversed, where the girl is the wild one and likes to hook up a lot with guys, and where the guy is super sweet and kind of innocent (not really), waiting for the right girl

Bennett and Avery are the opposite of each other but when an almost tragic incident brings them together, life plays a little trick on them.Avery wants nothing to do with relationships and commitment, while Bennett wants someone to share his life with; so different yet so perfect for each other
 The story doesn't have that insta-love that is so overdone with other NA novels

 The relationship between the main characters develops throughout the story and you really don't know what is going to happen next


 Bennett is really sweet, protective, honest, hot and handsome
He made me feel all kinds of butterflies in my stomach

 Avery hasn't had an easy life, she has a lot of trust issues and she doesn&#8217;t open up too easy to strangers, but in the end, she found her way throughout the book and came to terms about her future.I think the story was something new


 It gave me a different perspective about what being a &#8220;virgin&#8221; really means


This book has a lot of scenes that can be uncomfortable for readers that are not too open about other options that don&#8217;t include sexual intercourse

I loved every single part of the book! Avery and Bennett had a strong chemistry going on between them.Christina Lee did an excellent job at creating such good characters and an amazing story that readers can relate to
From the scenes to the plot to the characters, this book is one of the best NA books that I have read
I totally recommend it.

$review_text.: Once again Sharon takes us to the land of Lyric. With adventure and high stakes on the horizon, she leads her heroic characters through tough battles--yes life vs. death, but also for their own sanity. And she never lets her characters off easily. I think readers will relate with Jake's mother (Susan, the restorer from book one in this series) as she is held captive by fiendish enemies of her mind. Anyone who has suffered with/battled depression will see him/herself in the story. Readers will root for Susan to overcome the mind bending tactics of the Rhusicans. I appreciated the symbolism of this portrayal. Jake, the other main character in this book, is called to a certain mission, though he's compelled to find and rescue his mother. All doors close in that regard as he is commissioned by The One to fight for the sake of His people. I loved this third book and appreciate how it rounded out the series. Sharon bravely tackled tough issues and wasn't afraid to dig deep, making the final victories that much more sweet. If you haven't read this series, read it. Book after book, you'll thrill to find yourself in the land of Lyric once again.

$review_text.: I was given this book to give my honest opinion. Let me just say that this book was totally awesome. You have everything that makes a great story. Ebony (The MC) is thrown into a world that she only though existed when you die. Might sound a bit morbid but one minute she is throwing a high school party and the next she enters the world of Demons and Angels. Only she doesn't know which one is worst. There is a secret that binds everyone around her with their silence but once the truth unfold you kind of wonder if this will be Ebony's undoing as well. There is a Love square. You have the best friend Luke, the bad boy Cadan, and the protector Nick. Her choice costs her everything, but will it be the fuel she needs to survive the tasks at hand? One still remains by her side through it all. To watch the one you love, love another from afar is torturous. No spoilers here. Just buy the book. It's a fabulous start to the trilogy.

$REVIEW.: We don't have enough books like this. Walker's lucid prose is used to excellent effect in FROZEN SECRETS: ANTARCTICA REVEALED, a mix of geology, physics, paleobiology, engineering and history. Children's science writing has an extreme bias toward biology (I am guilty of this, too). We do a half-decent job with space science and geology (thank you, astronauts and volcanoes!) but where are all the engineering books? Is there any area with such a yawning gap between importance to society and what we have to offer our children on the subject?At least now we have FROZEN SECRETS. Walker does a wonderful job of showing engineers applying their skills in this most forbidding of environments. One of my favorite bits concerns junior high school students constructing an underwater robot for use in Antarctica. This book is intelligent, thorough, well-designed, and engaging. I feel smarter after having read FROZEN SECRETS, and I wish there were more books like it to put into kids' hands.

$REVIEW.: although a great book, somewhat marred by a less than perfect translation (although let's give credit where credit is due, i would not have liked to edit this book) - this book reads somewhat like water.  about two thousand pages of the narrative deals with the journey of Priest, Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand as they travel westward in search of the scriptures of the "Greater Vehicle" - the other three hundred pages deals with the birth of the Monkey King and his rebellion in heaven at the start of the book, and the end where they finally reach the Thunder Monastary on Vulture Peak in the Western Heaven a.k.a. Tibet.pretty much the rest of the book deals with the trials and tribulations that these four monks (only three of which are fully developed characters: poor Friar Sand is left as the fifth wheel most of the time) go through in trying to 'fetch' these scriptures for the enlightenment of all humanity.  the priest is a real ding-dong, he's constantly getting himself into all sorts of trouble, and he never heeds the Monkey King's advice about anything, so the Priest is always falling into the jaws of some new monster on virtually every chapter.  the Pig is no better, as he would sooner run into trouble or create trouble for everyone else for the sake of either his pride or his stomach.  the Monkey King is the real hero of this book, as he is constantly rescuing everyone from some sort of demon or tempting succubus around practically every corner.  and what of Friar Sand? . . . well, he is just kind of there to guide the Priest's horse.this book is definitely worth a read though, i thoroughly enjoyed it, despite its short comings.  the incessant poetry gets kind of annoying though, most of it is relevant to the "plot" so you can't really skip too much of it.  i give it four stars.

$REVIEW.: I've never been much interested in this period in history thanks to boring high school history classes and then Harlequin Escape released this book.  I liked the idea of an Australian historical so I gave it a go - and I loved it!What did I love?  I loved the fact Matilda is a feisty heroine without a title or a position of privileged.  I loved the fact she was a gal who was actively trying to take her fate into her own hands instead of simpering and preening until someone directs her fate for her.  I loved the fact its set in the Aussie bush, a beautiful part of the world the author evokes wonderfully.  I learned quiet a bit without being lectured,all the while enjoying a tale of growing romance which kept the tension at just the right pitch.My only critique is the arc of the story could have been a bit longer.Looking forward to Tea Cooper's next offering.  If its anything like this one I'll be pre-ordering for sure.

$REVIEW.: The subtitle of this book, "The Credit Crisis Of 2008 And What It Means", is completely misleading unless you are satisfied with an answer that things are "changing".  Beyond that, Mr. Soros doesn't have much to say.  But don't take my word for this, just go to pages 158-159 in the Conclusion of his book where he states, as follows; "Near panic conditions prevail in financial markets.  People want to know what lies ahead.  I cannot tell them because I do not know.  What I want to tell them is something different.  I want to explain the human condition."The fact that Mr. Soros has made several billion dollars is probably more likely to disqualify, rather than qualify, him as an expert on the human condition.  He certainly would not be my first choice as a philosophical consultant.  Mr. Soros would be well advised that when he doesn't have something to say about making money, he probably shouldn't say anything at all.IMPORTANT ADDITION TO THIS REVIEW (10-06-08)Although Mr. Soros did not offer any advice on what to do, in light of the current credit crisis, it turns out that he was rather accurate in his assessment that big changes were coming.  If you want to understand what is actually going on in the economy, and learn what you can do to protect your assets, I strongly recommend that you check out a new book (published last month) entitled "Guide To Investing In Gold And Silver" by Michael Maloney.  The title is somewhat misleading because only one chapter is actually devoted to buying gold and silver.  The rest of the book, in a very facinating and easy to understand way, explains our monetary system, the federal reserve system, and the ramifications of having a fiat currency.  (I know this sounds like a tough read, but it's not.)  Once you understand these things, you'll understand what the hell Soros was trying to say and, most importantly, you'll have the knowledge to make YOUR OWN assessment of the economy, and you won't need George Soros or anyone else to tell you what you should do.
$SUMMARY.: Don't look in this book for financial advice.

$review_text.: The three months that I VERY thoroughly studied Roetzel, taught me an immense lot

Both on how to do things; also on how not to plan my future
Such as appearing perfect

But all the knowledge about do's and dont's, how things developed, history of fashion, and his touching anglophilia, held me long occupied
The typography is very neat


The colour images are quite well printed
And Roetzel helped me make decisions: If I choose a taylor in London, it will be Tobias Tailors
Huntsman is more fame and name than attractive product (+ triple price)

My shirts Hilditch and Key and Thomas Pink
And I am desperate for Weejun loafers from Bass! Also 5-10 pairs of shoes from Church's! But I agree with one critique, that unfortunately I'm an unlikely prospect for custom sewn shoes
- Five drawbacks to mention: a) Early in the book the author seems a bit arrogant, how impossible it really is ever to BECOME a gentleman, despite all efforts (!?); b) the male models, alas, are a bit sissy-ish for us northerners; c) advocating a 'cutthroat' for everyday shave, most barbers tell me is mildly obsolete; d) too little space spent on wool textile; e) the breakfastman in the last chapter must be a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Bill Clinton

AMUSING SIDE: How he devaluates the boring Burberry's coat lining pattern as touristy
(I agree.) Also, a hilarious comment on ostrich leather shoes! - CONCLUSION: Men of the world: Get hold of this book, mostly to learn how to go about things, and also a little bit to know which rules to break, if you so wish.

$REVIEW.: The thrust of Plato's argument against the poets can be paraphrased thus: "Yes, the gods may behave badly, but we must never portray them thus."  Such is the point, it seems, of Aaronovitch's shrill, self-satisfied screed

 "Conspiracy Theory" itself is a relatively recent term

 By examining its usage by the author (and others) it appears to mean .

"explanations that upset the persons employing the term 'conspiracy theory.'"  Not very helpful


 It has also become a "sexy" marketing term intended to enrapture a public already excited by the prospect of Meg Ryan portraying Mary Magdalene in "The Da Vinci Code 2."  In short, "Voodoo Histories" - from the false premises on which it's constructed to its execution - is essentialy indistinguishable from other product that tries to ride some public mania to the bank (e.g., Oliver Stone's execrable "JFK")


 A desperate act by a former Red trying to curry favor with the State?  Who knows?

$REVIEW.: I originally received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Even though I dabble in creative writing, I find the books from this series much more interesting and useful for journaling with my 13 year old daughter and as I mentioned in my review for one of the other books, they're great for starter topics for my language exchange blogs and chats, since they force me to think on a deeper level than the usual niceties and current events that we would usually talk about. There's enough to keep you writing for a long time in this one, and having it split into seasonal topics is nice.I'd recommend this one especially for journaling with younger/inexperienced writers, the prompts are solid enough give them something to really dig into to write about, unlike a lot of creative writing prompts that can be kind of vague and confusing for someone just starting out.

$review_text.: I admit it, the title was part of the reason I selected this book to review. The other part was that my wife grew up on a farm so between dating her and family visits I have learned a little about the issue of manure, or so I thought.  Gene Logsdon's book provides a comprehensive look at the issue of manure and the role it can play in addressing issues from food production to environmental impact.  I had known that modern agriculture was as much based on hydrocarbons as it was on sunshine.  Between fertilizer, farm machinery, heating etc.The title may give you the impression that this is a lighthearted look as the issue of manure.  Be warned, while there is gentle humor throughout the book and more than a little irony, the book is first a serious discussion of manure.  The book covers issues ranging from the physical attributes of manure - sheep give the best by the way, all the way to its impact on agriculture profits, environmental concerns and suburban aesthetics.  Covering all of these issues would give you the impression that the book is a dry academic discussion of a relatively mundane issue. Not true.What drew me to the book and kept me reading was Logsdon's prose and style.  The book is written in an easy style, almost as if you are sitting on a bench or at a kitchen table shooting the you know what.  The style draws you forward to learn more as it contains a mixture of personal observation, researched insight and experience.  This combination makes the book interesting, particularly if you are curious to learn something about a subject you have never really thought about in depth.The only issue I had with the book was the need occasionally to fold the book so people could not read the cover, particularly on an airplane where people pointed out that it was rather rude to have foul language on a book cover.  Other than that, this book provides an enlightening view of an issue that we too often flush out of or minds.  Beware that this is a serious discussion, so if you are not interested in learning about the subject, you may want to spend your time elsewhere.

$REVIEW.: This is a fantastic book if you're a football fan and you want to know more details of how the game is played

 I've been interested in football (I love the game) for more than 20 years and was itching to get a better picture of what goes on inside teams

For example, how they prepare for games, what are the responsibilities of the different coaches, etc
This book opens up a whole new level of understanding presented by someone who is clearly an expert and who has the resume to prove it

 It has some great tips on just how to watch the game
I highly recommend this book!

Where would your emotions be?Chloe is a young woman working for a powerful man, Patrick Collins. Chloe is in love or lust with her boss from afar. Patrick is feeling the same for Chloe. These two are dancing around each other leaving the air thick with lustful intentions and words unspoken.

As always with a romantic story, there is a bitter woman who does not want this to happen. Enter into the picture, Baroness Anna. By all accounts she is an uber witch, who gets off on making others miserable and she is determined to have Patrick.As Chloe and Patrick embark into unknown relationships, we meet Ryan. Ryan is a sweetheart that loves Patrick like no other. Ryan sees these two and knows that sparks are flying. Chloe and Patrick continue their relationship all the while having interference from the Baroness. With this interference comes deception and deceit. Will Chloe buckle under the pressure? Is Patrick being honest? Check out Deceived and you will not be disappointed.Review for Literary Jewels4 stars

$review_text.: The first Sewing School focuses on hand sewing.  Many of the reviews for that book included comments from readers wishing for more machine sewing projects to do with kids.  I suspect that may have prompted the authors of Sewing School, Andria Lisle and Amie Plumley, to write this sequel--Sewing School 2.I had a chance to look at an ebook copy of this book (on my computer).  I really like it!  But, before I go any farther describing this book, I want to mention that I WOULD NOT purchase a kindle edition of this book unless you are going to be looking at it on your computer (not on a kindle).  Even then, this is one of those books that will be much, much easier to use in print than electronically.My daughter, Sami, has been asking since last week to learn how to sew on my machine.  She even bought a kids' machine at a garage sale, which didn't work.  Because she wants to so much, I have promised that I would teach her.  I have to admit, though, that I was at a bit of a loss as to where to start and what to make.  This book will make it simple for me.The book starts off which what supplies are needed.  It explains all the different parts of a sewing machine and gives good safety tips.  There are a bunch of simple sewing projects (like bags, organizers, a scarf, decorations, a pillow, and more...) that you can use scrap material around your house to make.  Yay!  I love crafts that we can make with things we already have.I think the authors have done a great job writing a book to teach kids  how to sew with a sewing machine (and guide their parents)!  There is one minor thing that I wish there was more information about in this book.That topic is choosing a sewing machine for a child.  I have been told that children's sewing machines are a waste of money.  But, what is the best basic sewing machine for them to learn on?Books often help pave the way for me.  They make a project seem doable when it seems formidable to me and I'm not sure where to start.  Sewing School 2 is just that kind of book for me and my family!Please note that I received a complimentary ebook copy of this book for review from Storey Books.

$review_text.: ****SLIGHT SPOILERS*****I have only ever written one review but this deserves another because this was phenomenal. Nolan was by far my favorite, which is surprising because usually I get attached to one side of the main couple. This was a fun, light read with just the right amount of angst. It has a HEA which is a big selling point for me. I read it all in one sitting and didn't even stop to check the time. Whoops. Books where the H already has a family and finds the h and introduces her to them, usually lessens the story because I feel like I don't know enough about their family or what it's like, but even though I don't know much about Angie, I didn't even stop to think I needed to. I felt like the story had a very natural flow and I really enjoy that in a book. I recommend this to anyone 17 and older (language and sexual content) because it just captivates you to the point where you can't put it down.

It is obvious that Vince has done exhaustive work over a period of many years to be able to write a book in such detail.  I am amazed how many former SS agents Vince has been able to get in contact with as I am sure most are reticent to discuss the events of 11/22/1963.Survivor's Guilt belongs on the book shelve of anyone with a serious interest  in the JFK assassination as a detailed reference book on the SS agents involved.  Researchers such as Mr. Palamara are to be applauded for the passion with which they approach this seminal event in American history.

I mean really princess character has so many issue that I don't know where to draw the line


Hopping on the bike chasing after killers like she's a patch member and boxing with the hero; who by the way punch her in the face, I think not
This book have many unbelievable scenarios going on that it just makes hard to want to read
Waste of my time and .99c

It look like the author was trying to hard to make it believable and it so did not work for me
And Im not even going to start on our hero character; who is possessive of her, but use her as a punching bag because his brothers are watching

$review_text.: Overall I enjoyed this book but found some of the details and descriptions overkill. The author went on and on and on in certain parts when it really was not necessary. Could have used a bit of editing to cut it down. I also thought that Jake was a bit of a spoiled brat. Yes, he respected her wishes about sex and waited but he was so childish about it at times. By the time a man is thirty and truly in love there should be a certain amount of maturity. You hope! I was glad for the happy ending in the book but felt bogged down with all the descriptions and details. Page after page describing wedding flowers and details. I  kept saying to myself "come on just get to it!" I do confess I skipped a few pages due to the endless descriptions and details. I would like to see this book with less detail and more meat. I was glad to see both of the main characters grow up some during their time apart though. I wanted to smack both of them a few times! The wealth of Jake and his family seemed un-realistic in the story in my opinion. Again, overall I enjoyed this book. I liked the fact that Emily stuck to her convictions and found true love in the end.
$SUMMARY.: too many details but a sweet story overall

$REVIEW.: Sky is the best writer for highland romance time travel. I can't put these books down once I start reading them. You feel like you know the characters and that you are right there with them. You never know what is going to happen next. The adventure and suspense keep you reading and also keep you guessing right up to the last page. All of these books take you through hell and back and by the end of each book you feel exhausted and happy and ready to jump right into the next one. The sexual scenes are hot and well done. Read these books, you will be so glad you did. I just got her newest book, Highland Defiance and the first paragraph hooked me so here I go on another wonderful exciting adventure with braw men, beautiful lassies, adventure, magic, time travel, and romance.

$REVIEW.: To be honest, prior to &#34;the deepest acceptance&#34; i was no fan of Jeff Foster....he was just to neo-advaita

Neo-advaita is helpful at certain levels or points but as a whole teaching it is deeply unbalanced
But what a wonder this book is!!Jeff Foster is deffinitly growing and starting to open up the emotional body for beginning emotional integration.He even had a newsletter where he stated &#34;i am no longer a teacher of non-duality&#34;.At some points he is still very mental (&#34;just notice the open space you are&#34;.....which is not so easy for most people), but most of the time he is incrediblly open and intimate wih his readers.


He explains that seeking englightenment is just an escape mechanism, which i found to be true in my own experience
Jeff Foster beautifully guides the reader deeper and deeper into the emotional realm and becoming authentic by accepting our negative stuff


He goes into great detail to show the reader the immense value of working to be more authentic, accepting and open to ones feelings.Also does he share very interessting stories he had with seekers who came to him for guidance and goes deep into the themes relationships, addiction and spiritual seeking
Even non-dual fundamentalism is addressed several times.If one resonates with the theme of acceptance and really wants to get things going i suggest David Hawkins book &#34;letting go- the pathway of surrender&#34; for more practical applications of the theme &#34;feeling ones emotions to release/integrate them&#34; and for full emotional body clearing (which leads to a very integrated non-dual state and death of the doer) i suggest Michael Browns &#34;the presence process&#34;.much love to allMichael

$REVIEW.: I'm totally loving this series and am totally surprised that it has been as good as fifty shades. Fifty shades is a hard series to be beat. I read a lot,and if a book doesn't grab my attention within the first few chapters it never gets finished.  I would be honored to be able to read ANY of your books before their release dates. And would also like to help spell check for you. One of the things that can really turn me off about any book is misspellings. Any publishing company good enough to publish a good read should be willing and able to spell check for their authors. "Realize, Apologize" are a few examples that were misspelled not once but EVERY TIME they were used through the book.Any writer who can write this good should be able to spell and to me that is something the publisher should be responsible for.  The storyline is absolutely Awesome but please find someone better to proofread your work.  Please let me know if I can help. And again Please, Please let me be one of your "before release date" Readers.THANK YOU JS TAYLOR for such an Awesome Series.~Alznuthouse~

$review_text.: I have to be honest, this was my first necromancer book. AS I first began to read this book, I was a bit concerned I was not going to be able to get into it. However, with each page I turned, I was sucked into the story even more. It is a very unique story, that you just feel the need to have more of. I scored it a 4 because I felt their could have been a little more character development. There were times I felt a bit confused because I did not understand what was going on. I feel some back story on the characters might have helped with that some. With that being said, the story was darkly beautiful and I am awaiting book 2, as I feel a deep need to know what happens next. Perhaps Pierre has me under a spell just from reading the book....or perhaps it is Lizzy that I must find out more about.  I do believe that in his only way Pierre love Lizzy, but I fear, Lizzy will has fallen in love with someone in which she has no idea of what he is capable of. Could this lead to a falling out, or a Gothic love affair that the readers can't put down. I, myself can not wait to find out!

$REVIEW.: I have truly enjoyed four other books by Mr. Lynskey, one of which was a Frank Johnson mystery.  Once again, Mr. Lynskey doesn't disappoint.  Ms. Taliaferro's precocious 15-year old daughter is killed by her prized thoroughbred when she falls and the horse crushes her skull.  At least that is what the Kaiser, Va police believe.  Ms. Taliaferro, a hard-bitten and stubborn woman, refuses to believe it and calls in Frank Johnson to investigate, to the great annoyance of the local police chief.  Johnson is faced with numerous suspects, all the while re-acquainting himself with a former flame.  Like the traditional PI of Hammett and Chandler, Johnson is stabbed, knocked on the head, and shot at.  Believable characters, crisp dialogue, and good plot.  Well done!

$review_text.: This is fairly good military sci fi.  What lets it down is the sort of dialogue that sounds as if someone has combined "Top Gun" with "Star Ship Troopers", where everyone has to make quips all the time.  The romantic elements demonstrate why military establishments frown upon liaisons within units.  It leads to decisions being made that have more to do with feelings than in winning what appears to be a very losable war.  Even with the romantic entanglements, I have to wonder whether military people would make those sorts of decisions in real life.  If it comes down to the mission or the "loved one" and given the importance of the mission, I suspect that many military officers and enlisted men will take the course of ensuring that the mission succeeds.  Of course, in the book, most of the decisions turn out okay anyway, ie the people survive.  I look forward to the odd book that will have the loved one sacrificed so that a mission will succeed.The action scenes are not too badly done, but they do confuse how fighter aircraft have to fight in atmosphere with how they might fight in space.I think that I will get the second book and hope that it improves a little.

$REVIEW.: The Weight Loss Game does a very effective job of giving you information from all sources
Many of the hundreds of weight loss books out there give you plans and some tidbits and such, but Victoria has gone the extra mile, giving you many tips and tricks that you may never have even known about


This will help you reach your goals all that much quicker.Victoria helps you understand the inside and out of labels, diets and everything inbetween, while at the same time not overloading you with too much information and making you feel like you can truly succeed
And with this much valuable information, it will be hard for you not to succeed
The Weight Loss Game deserves to be one of your first choices as you won't need another book on weight loss after reading

Instead you'll be well on your way to your goals.

$review_text.: This novella has some great ideas, from a hellacious setting to a central character rebelling against his demonic father


 The plot threads and character ideas are fantastic, and some of the prose is almost inspired


 However, there is plenty of awkward or simplistic moments which seem artificial or manufactured


 These developments advance the plot and relationships, leading to sudden intimate encounters which have plenty of heat, even if they often seem forced

 Still, the mythology of the world and the intricate characteristics of the two protagonists, a virgin werewolf princess and a demonspawn vampire, have me intrigued enough to want to read the sequel.

Bad writing, silly plots, etc. I still will finish the book.Crazy Love's writing style was choppy and obnoxious, there was not enough intrigue or emotion to justify the read. There were no love scenes at all in the first 60%, so not even a cheap thrill to keep a reader going.I have never held a $2.99 romance to the standards of classic literature. But this story is far to &#34;fluffy&#34; in plot and drama, without anything exciting or complelling to hold my interest.

(think rich girl, fat boy, bad boy etc) WHAT?The synopsis on NetGalley was intriguing enough to have me click on the Read Now button


I started it almost immediately, and finished it in one sitting- not because I couldn&#8217;t get enough but more like to get an answer to the question- why they even here and what the heck are they doing?John Dreamer was a pretty short book- that made no sense while looking at the big picture
You basically get what&#8217;s going on within a few chapters- that these kids are here to overcome their fears and once they do that, they disappear, reappear in the real world- ultra successful, of course!This book was seven types of weird, with a battle, a murder trial, and a casting scene I mean- what was I even reading? And, of course, there was an ever present &#8216;googly eyes&#8217; romance side to it- withan unexpected and abrupt twist.I suppose looking at this- especially the Great White Room is a metaphorical manner would have been more pleasing but it just wasn&#8217;t happening


Believe me, I tried.So, all in all, I won&#8217;t be picking up part two- this was way too random for my liking.

$REVIEW.: There Be Dragons is a fast paced, action adventure twist mixed with elements of suspense and horror. It is packed with war torn carnage that makes the Predator and Jurassic Park movie seem meek.  The storyline makes it difficult, at times, to discern the difference between reality and fiction.  Lieutenant Ethan Jacobs arrives during The Vietnam War and immediately questions his carnal nature while remaining suspect of his future return home.  We get the opportunity to read Lieutenant Jacobs thoughts before he becomes engaged in bloody battle.  The conflict is a brutal campaign that fully tests the resolve of each soldier whether they are confronting men or myth.  I will not spoil the surprise, but you can literally smell the burning embers emitted by one mysterious foe.  You will definitely enjoy this novel if you do not mind experiencing a few nightmares.  I highly recommend it for the imagination factor alone.  A truly thrilling experience!

I have found the content of Jen's Social Media Blog and Facebook page to be so useful, so I was very excited to read this book!With that said, however, I was somewhat disappointed in reading The Courage to Receive.The book touches on the points everyone experiences in loss, disappointment, and struggle. We've all experienced setbacks to one degree or another and can all learn from them. The book is clearly written, easy to read and short enough (too short) that you don't lose attention or can't find the key points.While the strategies she presents for getting out of your bad attitude after failure are spot on. And, the compassion and wisdom with which she presents are great, I didn't feel that I learned anything new or life changing to help me out of a bad situation. Everything that she stated - is already common knowledge.I'd highly recommend that you visit Jen's Social Media Blog for some great content!

$REVIEW.: God, I don't even know where to begin with this book. Just WOW. So far, this has been my favorite read in the last year. While some people will frown upon the cheating aspect of the story, I get it... I really do.How? Because the book was well written, and full of emotion. Mia Asher is a true poet when it comes to writing from the heart. I literally found myself re-reading paragraphs and/or entire pages over again because they were so beautifully written.As I read the book, I put myself into each character's position and thought about their points of view.Cathy needed someone who wouldn't placate her and someone to be there for her the way she needed them to be.Ben could not do that. He was a great character, and although he shared the same losses with Cathy, he truly did not feel the way she did. He thought he was doing right by her, by staying positive about their situation, when really, he needed to just lay down and cry with her. He needed to let her grieve the way she needed to, and she tried on several occasions to get this from him, but he just didn't GET IT. His way to deal with their situation was to try and stay positive.That was exactly the opposite of what Cathy needed. She needed someone to scream with, to cry with, and to grieve with.Enter Arsen.. He helped her through the worst part of her life by letting her be who she needed to be, and he gave her that outlet that she so desperately needed from her husband and didn't get. He was her release from the pain and suffering she'd endured with her losses.I loved all three characters, and in the end, I really do feel that Cathy ended up with the right person. I recommend this book to everyone who asks me for recommendations.
$SUMMARY.: Wonderful book!

$REVIEW.: Used this book with my middle schooler (homeschooled) for language arts this year.  We really enjoyed sitting together and using the 2 page layout that follows each chapter.  Lots of thought provoking questions.  Beware...the &#34;test&#34; at the end of the book is tricky and has lots of little things!  Pay attention as you read :)

$REVIEW.: This story started out with the reader knowing more than the main characters as many stories do.  I found myself thinking things like, "no don't go in the house" or "No!  Not the basement!" but of course the characters always do (there would be no story if they didn't!).  What I didn't expect though was how quickly I would be sucked into the actual telling of the story.  Somewhere between the beginning of the third chapter and the end of the fourth chapter I slipped into reader mode and forgot that I was supposed to be reviewing this work.  To me that is the sign of a wonderful writer.  I read tens of thousands of pages a year so when one comes along that sucks me in I am always impressed!What unfolded, very quickly, was an intriguing story of a haunting.  The action grew in a crescendo from small, somewhat familiar occurences in a beautiful old house, to exciting and definitely scary scenes that revealed the  secrets the victorian residence guarded.  The pace of this story was brilliant and I found that I lost track of time as I raced to try and solve the mystery of the antagonist before the characters in the story.  When everything did unravel, I was definitely surprised by the twist at the end.It was clear that Mrs. Sutton did her research before writing this piece.  Her understanding of technical terms as well as religious rituals and gods and goddesses was impressive.  All in all, she delivered a well thought out story with excellent pacing and an original take on the traditional haunted house story.  I would definitely recommend this story to anyone looking for something a little darker and raw.  I will absolutely read more by this author.

$review_text.: Boy oh Boy, Lonnie sure does have a lot on her plate! She thought she was married to Gideon but low and behold, another woman pops up and claims to be his lawful wife!Will she be able to hold on and wait for Gideon to return? It takes a lot of time for him to get Cassie to be at the judge's chambers at the same time that he is so that the judge can be absolutely sure that they both want the divorce.It takes longer than anyone thought it would, especially Lonnie. She is trying to provide for herself and her son and the new minister might just be the ticket. Or is he?It's a great story about how love can see you thru if you allow it. It's a good story that will warm your heart and hopefully give you some much needed hope in regards to true love. Being in love is hard sometimes but the rewards are there, if you really look for them and cherish them.

It's the kind of ingenuity I would expect from our planet in the face of a catastrophe such as that describe in the books.

$REVIEW.: The author presents some clear proposals for correcting the income inequality problem that America is facing. None of them is radical in the sense that he is advocating a complete change from capitalism to socialism. Rather, he advocates leveling the playing field to get us back to the decades immediately after World War II, when ordinary people had a fair chance to realize &#34;the American dream&#34;.The chances of his proposals being adopted by either the Republicans or the Democrats are slim, because the fat cats in both parties refuse to give up their favored positions. Despite that, the book is well worth reading, because it shows that there are viable non-violent actions that can be taken to right the economic wrongs that presently plague America.

$REVIEW.: What a great way to grow a closer relationship with God!I have been reading Barbie's words over on her blog (My Freshly Brewed Life) for over a year and we share so many things, but the most important one is our love for Jesus!  We also share a desire to speak life, a gift of Intercession and encouragement, and a hope that our readers will come to know that Jesus is personal and intimate... He is real and He's so in love with you!In this 31 day Devotional, she includes daily devotionals that cover such topics as: Do You Trust Me, I Am a Good Father, I Believe in You, Tear Down Those Walls, You are Loved, You Are Not a Failure, and I Delight In You!I love how each of the 31 days is set up!  It doesn't require an hour of quiet time - but gets your straight to what matters most!  Barbie invites you right in to a talk with Jesus! With each Daily Devotional, she includes a conversation with Jesus, a Scripture, and she invites you in to have a conversation with Jesus yourself. She provides space to write down what is stirred up in you (similar to Listening Prayer) and then each entry closes with a prayer.This is available just in time to be a perfect Christmas gift, Stocking stuffer... or really, it's an invitation for ANY time of year! This little gem is now available on Kindle and in Soft Cover.  What a great way to kick off the New Year... a month long standing coffee date with Jesus! What is better than that?

$review_text.: I haven't read many of Dekker's novels but I couldn't resist this one that he labeled an Historical Romance. After all, that's my specialty! Anyway, let me first say that I don't care for vampires. But let me also say how refreshing it was to see that vampires are actually evil in this story. I'm sorry, but I just can't get into the contemporary blood-sucking, pale-faced, creature as the romantic hero. Despite the vampires and the gore, this book kept me up LATE into the night. But that's Dekker's specialty, writing books you can't put down. This one is no exception. As far as the romance goes.. well, I wasn't particularly feeling it. But the spiritual warfare was awesome! And I adored the hero, even if he did seem a bit Emo at times. I have no idea why this book was banned in some stores. The symbolism of the power inherent in a blood sacrifice (a theme that also runs through the Bible) as well as the allegorical reference to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ on the cross was a theme that ran throughout the story. The sacrifice of unconditional love is expressed to the full by the shedding of blood. Anyway, a book well worth reading. But look beyond the vampires to the true meaning.

$REVIEW.: The novel itself has many strengths and few weaknesses.The story flows very smoothly and has a decent plot butit's greatest strength is in the character details.Witch Hunter reflects well on the different perspectivesand views of the main antagonists and protagonists.Motives are explained well and allows the reader to reallyget into the minds of the characters.The author also manages to convey a very real sense of grimdesperation about many of the characters in the novel.This allows for a feel of the warhammer fantasy world thati have expected but not seen realized in other warhammer fiction.The only weakness as i saw it was that the author may have spenttoo long building the mystery and suspense.  I found myselfnodding off during the first half of the novel.  It was wellwritten but tended to get a bit boring during the first half.Once i reached the second half, it was a straight readingsession til the end of the novel.  I felt that certain segmentscould have been shortened, thus the 4 stars and not 5.

Batterson uses the story of David to help describe to the reader how they can start to discover their &#34;divine destiny.&#34; Although I had a good time reading the book, I wasn't blown away by it. I sat down and read it in one sitting, as it is only about 150 pages. If I had not heard so much about Batterson in the past, I probably wouldn't read more by him based on this book alone. I will, however, eventually pick up &#34;In a Pit with a Lion on a Snowy Day&#34; sometime down the road.

Several relatives who were thought to be dead are alive and think that the boy is key to ten million dollars stolen years ago.  Events show that the KGB found the money shortly after the heist and that three of the living thieves got to America and were successful.The father dies of cancer but there is hope!  A Russian researcher has given a locket to the boy who is told to never take it off.  Is it the key to a fortune?

$review_text.: *****5- O'Rourke Never Disappoints -Stars*****~this review may contain minor spoilers~Flashes! That's what I call them
I'm Charley Shepard, the girl who can see things, the seventeen-year-old with an overactive imagination, the freak who can see lights like a thousand photographers crammed inside her head snapping away all at once!I have been waiting a long-a** time for this book/series to come out, now that it's here, I'm happy to say I was not disappointed

Not that I really expected to be, I don't think there is anything that Tim O'Rourke could come out with that I wouldn't love with everything that I have


He once again throws us into a world of unknowns, biting our nails wondering what will happen next

No one does mystery or horror like O'Rourke does, every story is so different from anything else out there and Flashes is just another example of that.If the flashes were really visions of some kind, then what would that make me? A medium? Clairvoyant? Psychic? Or just someone who could see people's deaths? Because that's what I always saw in those flashes-I saw people dying.Charley has had visions, or 'flashes' as she calls them, for as long as she can remember
No one believes her and have always chalked it up to an overactive imagination, though Charley knows better

The only person who has ever had faith in her, who stuck up for her and believed in her, was her best friend Natalie
But with Natalie's sudden and brutal death, Charley is left alone when her flashes return with a vengeance, hitting stronger than ever before and this time she is determined to prove once and for all that she is not crazy and what she sees is real


This is how she meets Police Constable Tom Henson.&#8220;I'm scared because I saw that girl being dragged to her death, but there is another part of me that's happy too.&#8221; she whispered.&#8220;How can you be happy about a young girl losing her life?&#8221;&#8220;It means I'm not losing my mind

It proves I haven't been making this stuff up
The stuff I saw in those flashes wasn't the work of my overactive imagination

They weren't dreams, nightmares or hallucinations


They were real!&#8221;Tom doesn't know what to make of Charley


On the one hand-he doesn't really think she is lying to him about her flashes exactly and she doesn't seem to be crazy

But on the other hand-how can he really believe her? Stuff like that just doesn't happen
However, she does seem to know more than she should about the death of the girl he is currently investigating and he's desperate to find out if she was in fact murdered or if it was just a tragic accident
Charley is determined to get Tom to believe her, but will he? Can they find the answers they are looking for before the killer strikes again, if there is in fact a killer to  be found?And what if she was right and the flashes were true? What if Charley saw some clue-something that would explain what had really happened to Kerry Underwood? What did I do with that information?Since this was only part one of a three part story, we are left with more questions than answers, especially with the ending that left me screaming at my kindle
Tim O'Rourke is damn good at making my heart drop into my stomach and then cutting me off with my mouth laying on the floor
Every time I finish one of his books I'm left climbing the walls wondering when in the hell I'll be able to get my greedy little fingers on his next book

Sadist :pBut that is just one of the many reasons why my 'O'Rourke Obsession' started waaaayy back with Vampire Shift and has steadily grown over the last two years into the all-encompassing addiction that it is today


The fact that he is such an awesome and brilliant (if somewhat evil) author is made that much sweeter with the knowledge that he is a genuinely nice guy as well


He loves his fans with all that he has and shows this on a daily basis

I count myself lucky that I can now call him friend and am so happy with all the success he has earned
Not only does he deserve it, but us readers would be missing out on some truly spectacular work if he had never made the decision to publish that first book
If you haven't had a chance to read any of his work yet, you are being severely deprived


So pick a series, any series, he has several to choose from, and dive into the world of the O'Rourkians


This man is our master and we are his willing followers.Jenn @ Bookworm Betties

$review_text.: Petty, Scott. Little Black Book: Science and God. Kingsford, Australia: Matthias Media, 2011. 978-1-921896-19-4. No price on cover.Promoters identify Science and God as intended for Christian youth between the ages of 14 and 20. Its author, Scott Petty, is a youth minister in Sydney, which seems to support this identification. So, if you're the parent or friend of a 14-20 year old, or if you're a 14-20 year old yourself, the publisher, Matthias Media, hopes you'll purchase this book. Should you?As I see it, the most important thing for Christian youth is to get solidly grounded in a consistently Christian, thoroughly biblical, way of thinking. The typical pattern today is for Christian youth to be well entertained and fed a lot of fluff in high school and college "youth groups," then to fall into either nominal Christianity or non-Christianity thereafter. If they fall into nominal Christianity, they will most likely end up in a church where they will, as in youth, be well entertained and fed a lot of fluff...for life. Thus, the contemporary situation is that large numbers of Christians of all ages have never received, and so need, the same thing Christian youth need: solid grounding in a consistently Christian and thoroughly biblical way of thinking. Books providing such a grounding are therefore of great value and deserve high recommendation from any reviewer.Science and God, alas, is not such a book. If you're looking for concise but consistently biblical booklets, Answers In Genesis (AIG)'s series of Pocket Guides would be a better choice. If Science and God is any indicator, Matthias Media's Little Black Books should only be read if what you're looking for is a concise presentation of contemporary compromise, that believing-unbelieving, Christian-secular, biblical-unbiblical hybrid way of thinking tragically dominant among today's Christians, particularly among Christian academics. This particular manifestation of contemporary compromise comprises the following chapters: "Introduction" (5-7), "Chapter 1: Why you don't need to pick a team [either God and Christianity or Science]" (9-33), "Chapter 2: Big Bang or big God?" (35-45), "Chapter 3: Dramatic design or a risky existence?" (47-63), "Chapter 4: Evolution or evil-ution?" (65-81), "Chapter 5: God and the evidence" (83-91), and "Chapter 6: Q&A;" (93-100).In the Introduction, Petty notes that, though he was no lover of science in high school or after, the anti-Christian work of the New Atheists, whom he calls "the celebrity scientists" ("scientists and authors like Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and others") motivated him to write Science and God. "Truth be told," he writes, "I find it annoying that anyone should argue [in the manner of the New Atheists]...that science should be pitted as an alternative to religion, as an enemy of God, or a substitute for belief. There is plenty of room for both, and both are necessary for balanced human existence. That's what this Little Black Book is all about" (7). Astute readers may perceive in this statement a desire to make the Bible and science address wholly unconnected realms of inquiry, an effort requiring one to creatively reinterpret any scriptural statements relevant to science.In Chapter 1, "in many ways...the most important chapter in the book," Petty tries to show that "Christians can and should pick both God and science" (12). In this chapter, Petty rightly notes that Christians' Bible-based "belief in an ordered universe, governed by a good and rational God, is very fruitful soil for science to grow in" (13), whereas such other systems of thought as ancient polytheism (14) and modern atheism (15) do not entirely fit with scientific work, since their underlying assumptions are in fact contrary to those science requires. Also in this chapter, Petty lists some of the Christian scientists he thinks nicely illustrate the compatibility of Christian faith with science (21-6). Among these scientists are Francis Collins, John Haught, (Sir) John Houghton, and Bill (William D.) Phillips. Notably, these men are all theistic evolutionists (Amazon does not permit URLs in reader reviews, but I found confirming Web articles plentiful). Petty's belief is that "Christians need to be into science and champions of science, even allowing scientific discoveries to challenge the way we understand passages in the Bible" (30-1).From his choice of evolutionists as exemplifying the proper Christian approach, one would assume he considers evolutionary theory one of the "discoveries" in terms of which we should "challenge" existing understandings of Scripture -- that is, in terms of which Scripture should be reinterpreted. However, another statement he makes in the chapter suggests he may not have thoroughly thought through the issues involved. He writes: "Can science tell me anything about the Fall of Rome, or World War II, or your summer holidays?....the answer is 'No'. Can I put the events of 11 September 2001 in a lab to examine them scientifically? No" (28). What Petty seems to say here is that non-repeatable past occurrences cannot be addressed by science, that "scientific discoveries" are limited to the sorts of present-day, repeatable phenomena that can be studied in a laboratory. Petty does realize that evolutionary theory attempts, on the basis of present-day evidence, to describe what probably happened in an unrepeatable and not-directly-observable past, doesn't he? While study of whether evolution of one kind of life into another, or of non-life into life, can occur today might constitute science on the present-day-repeatable-phenomena definition, theoretical reconstructions of what happened in the past to produce the lifeforms we observe today does not. Petty's desire to see the evolutionary story of origins as science does not comport with his own intuition about what forms of investigation science includes.In any case, Petty's way of bringing Scripture and "scientific discoveries" into agreement is something called "layered explanation," a concept he attributes to John Haught (31). The basic idea, which is hardly limited to the thinking of Haught, builds upon the truism that any given phenomenon may be explained or described from various perspectives or on various levels. For instance, a book's origin may be explained in terms of the publisher's initiation of the project (comparable to God's decision to create the universe) or in terms of the printing process that brings the desired book into existence (comparable to evolution, perhaps) (32-3). That phenomena may be described or explained on multiple levels is certainly not controversial; multilevel descriptions and explanations are pervasive in human thought. Petty notes that "How and why we have a universe at all, how it works, and how we work are all questions with layers of explanation," which is no doubt true. It is also likely true, as Petty states, that "Some layers are open to scientific examination" while others "require an answer from outside science -- from God himself" (33). This raises a question: what should faithful Christians do when God has addressed in Scripture layers of explanation that "scientific discoveries" now claim to explain differently?Petty answers this question in chapter 4. After noting some reasons one might legitimately doubt evolutionary theory (65-73), Petty explains why he does not think it would be a problem for "Bible-believing, Jesus-loyal, God-fearing Christians" if it were proven conclusively that "all the species of life that have ever existed and that ever will exist" are correctly explained by evolutionary theory (74-5). Put simply, Petty favors an interpretation of Scripture that sees the Genesis creation account as just a vivid and memorable way of saying that God created everything out of nothing, relating nothing "historical or scientific" beyond that bare fact of theism, so that anything that scientists care to theorize about origins is perfectly okay for Christians to embrace. (This interpretation is more widely known as "literary framework.") The Genesis creation account, in Petty's view, is one layer of explanation -- a pretty thin layer, if you ask me. Since this layer contains no information about what actually happened, beyond the bare reality that God is the one who made it happen, and perhaps some idea of why he made it happen, the job of telling us "what actually happened" in the material world is left entirely to the layer of explanation modern science lays down. Clever and creative people like Meredith Kline have promoted this "make Genesis mean nothing (so far as events in the material world are concerned) so science can claim anything" (my wording) approach, and maybe one can be forgiven for finding it a tempting way to avoid the need to argue about origins at all. But can one really claim to be a "Bible-believer," can one truly honor Scripture as infallible and authoritative revelation, while adopting this approach to its very first words?The way Petty frames the scientific issue shows that he is not conversant with contemporary Young Earth Creationism (YEC). For instance, he describes the creation-evolution debate as one concerning whether evidence of microevolution, "adaptive change within a species," favors belief in macroevolution, "all life has evolved from the first one-celled creature" (66-7). Contemporary YEC, however, increasingly eschews the term "microevolution" as misleading. While YEC advocates accept that "adaptive change" occurs within created kinds, they note that these changes involve loss of information and so do not constitute upward movement as the term "evolution" implies (in popular understanding, at least). One could say that lifeforms become more "fit" for specific environmental niches by losing broader "fitness" for a range of environments. For example, a bacterium has a protein altered and becomes less fit broadly speaking (it now reproduces more slowly, say), but more fit when it comes to surviving in the niche where antibiotics are present (since the action of some antibiotics only affects bacteria with the unaltered protein). (See Georgia Purdom's 07 July 2007 article, "Antibiotic Resistance of Bacteria: An Example of Evolution in Action?," on the AIG Web site, upon which my example is loosely based.) The point YECers increasingly emphasize is that observed adaptive changes within created kinds are not just quantitatively but qualitatively different from the "goo to you" evolution commonly labeled "macroevolution." These changes, they therefore assert, should not be called "evolution" at all, not even "microevolution."Petty's framing of the hermeneutical issue also shows ignorance of YEC. He writes: "Bible-believing [sic] Christians have discussed at least a dozen different ways of reading Genesis 1....And only one of those views, which sees Genesis 1 as an historical, chronological and scientifically viable account of the creation of the world in six 24-hour days, contradicts the scientific evidence that is emerging today. In other words," he continues, "if you read Genesis 1 as something other than a scientific and historical account of the creation of the world, you may not have a clash with the scientific evidence that is presenting itself" (76-7). He additionally characterizes YEC as "the scientific reading of Genesis 1" (77). In addition to making clear that Petty really does consider evolutionary theory among the "scientific discoveries" he believes should guide scriptural interpretation (in spite of his own suggestion earlier in the chapter that one might legitimately doubt "macroevolution"), this characterization of the issue misrepresents YEC. YECers do not hold that Genesis is written in scientific language; they merely recognize that Genesis constitutes a continuous historical narrative, one that extends on into Exodus. (There is no claim that Genesis and Exodus are "historical" in the sense of adhering to conventions of history writing invented more recently; rather, the books are "historical" in the sense of telling a story about things believed to have actually happened.) That one can discern (or perhaps impose) literary structure and styling on such passages as the creation account no more detracts from the "this actually happened" nature of the book than does the styling and structure of modern writers of history or other nonfiction. Given that Genesis recounts what "actually happened," it seems evident that modern claims about what happened in the past can be tested to see if they agree or disagree with what Genesis, and the entire Pentateuch, has to say. Petty's assertion in the closing Q&A; (Chapter 6) that "Genesis 1 is much more concerned with teaching us about God than about answering the particular scientific questions [better, questions about what actually happened] of any generation of people" (94) does nothing to change this; it merely expresses an increasingly popular fallacy I call "the main concern fallacy" (I would be surprised if no one else has identified this fallacy, though I've not yet run across the identification in my reading -- not that I recall, anyway). This fallacy holds that any irksome hermeneutical debate may be quickly dismissed if it does not address what one identifies as "the main concern" of a passage. If "the main concern" of Genesis 1 is "God as creator" then, this fallacy holds, what Genesis 1 has to say about what actually happened in physical reality (how God created) can be ignored. Obviously, this is not a valid way to approach Holy Writ.At one point, Petty suggests that placing ourselves in the "thought-world and culture" of the original recipients of Genesis will make us more open to the interpretation he favors (79). Let's see if that's true. Imagine we are Genesis' original recipients. As original recipients, having the account read to us by Moses or a priest, we are unencumbered by modern science and evolutionary theory. We appreciate craft in sacred stories, since it makes those stories easier for us to remember, but we see such craft as no reason to assume the stories didn't really happen as they're said to have happened. Further, the same Torah that tells us how God created in six days tells us that this creation week, with its concluding day of rest, is the basis for our own divinely-ordained practice of working six days each week then resting on the seventh (Exodus 20:8-11). Further, we recognize that the creation story flows smoothly into historical ("this is what happened") narrative that includes genealogies traceable from Adam to Abraham and thence to ourselves. Within this thought world, would it occur to any of us to interpret the creation account in any of the ways Petty and other modern accommodators do?If we extend our exercise into the thought-world of those who wrote and received the New Testament, we find our Savior saying that our first parents, Adam and Eve, were created in "the beginning of the creation" rather than long after the beginning (Mark 10:6; all Scripture quotations are from the King James Version, which is in the public domain). We also find our leading first-generation thinker, Paul, telling us that not only humans (Romans 5:12, 1 Corinthians 15:21), but "the creature" or "the whole creation" suffers from the "bondage of corruption" resulting from the fall of those first parents into sin (Romans 8:19-22). Though clever and creative moderns may think they see ways to explain these statements in evolution-consistent and old-earth-consistent ways, can one honestly assert that someone immersed in the thought-world and culture of New Testament believers would have understood these passages as indicating anything but that the original creation occurred as described in a straightforwardly-read Genesis 1 and that animal conflict (competition for limited resources, predation) and death (indispensable to evolution) are aspects of the "corruption" originating with the human-death-originating fall of humanity into sin? That God's concept of the ideal and uncorrupted does not include animal conflict and death would also seem evident to us from Isaiah's portrayal of the consummation as free of these things (Isaiah 11:6-10, 65:17-25). As Sarfati cogently argues, "bringing 'science' to bear on hermeneutics," as Petty wants to do, "is bringing a completely foreign context to the passages" (Jonathan Sarfati, Refuting Compromise [Green Forest, AR: Master Books, 2004], 41). Working from within the thought-world and culture of the original recipients of Scripture, would any but one of the alleged "at least a dozen" readings of Genesis 1 strike us as plausible?Let's face it. Arguments alone will never resolve the debate over interpretation of Genesis 1; no one on any side of the issue has said anything genuinely new in quite some time (so far as I've noticed). The question is really one of authority and obedience, of choice and commitment. Given sufficient cleverness and creativity, and a willingness to believe that your ability to imagine something makes it more likely to be true, disobedience can always be rationalized, whether disobedience in behavior or belief. This seems nowhere more true than in deciding whether you will (1) let the scientific implications of scriptural statements guide your understanding of science (that is, of the evidence interpreted by science) or (2) utilize your cleverness and creativity (or that of others) to persuade yourself that Scripture means something other than what it says. Will you choose to believe Scripture in its plain sense, or will you choose to make human cleverness and creativity, your own or that of others, your ultimate authority? If the latter, Petty's book may be for you, or for a 14-20 year old you'd like to influence in that direction. If the former, you'll prefer some other text -- Tim Chaffey and Jason Lisle's Old-Earth Creationism on Trial: The Verdict Is In (Green Forest, AR: Master Books, 2008), perhaps, or some of the AIG Pocket Guides already mentioned."But David," you respond, "why don't you tell us how you really feel? Seriously, though, I understand you disagree with Petty and think buying Science and God is a bad idea. What I don't understand is why you gave the book two stars rather than one. What gives?" Well, as already noted, some Christians want to believe they can be "Bible-believers" while interpreting Scripture in ways no original recipient could possibly have interpreted it (at least, I've yet to see any persuasive arguments that Scripture's original recipients could have understood what they received as teaching anything compatible with evolutionary theory, progressive creationism, or billions-of-years cosmology). For that constituency, this may be a worthwhile purchase. As the back cover blurb rightly states, the book is "a fun read" written in a "snappy style." It is both concise and entertaining, a suitable introduction to the methods of compromise for would-be compromisers age 14-20 and beyond.Additionally, the book does include some content even non-compromisers might find useful. Chapters 2 and 3, for example, include concise summaries of some general theistic arguments, borrowing from such thinkers as Norman Geisler and Richard Swinburne. Sadly, however, these chapters also emphasize Petty's belief that "The Bible can tell us about the cause of...[such things as the cosmic background radiation and cosmic ripples] at a spiritual and philosophical level" only (42; see also 62), not on the "earthly" level of material "this is what happened" reality (cf. John 3:12). This compromised content does not "cancel out" the positive and useful content, but it does raise the question of whether one's reading time might be better spent with other, less compromised, works.In spite of some positive content meriting an upgrade to two stars, and in spite of an entertaining and concise style, in the final analysis I must recommend against purchasing Science and God. It is primarily and pervasively a popularization of a compromised hermeneutic that subtly (not so subtly?) undermines Scripture's authority. As well, it makes no serious effort to grapple with the counterarguments of Young Earth Creationists, displaying at multiple points a basic misunderstanding of their perspective. For Bible-believing readers age 14-20, and for older readers who want something concise and accessible, there are far better books available, a few of which I've mentioned above.[This review has also been posted, with enhanced formatting and added links, to the reviewer's personal Web site.]

$review_text.: Carl is a successful screenwriter who lives in his deceased parents' home in Burbank.  It is the house he grew up in.  One night he awakens to find his long lost high school girlfriend in the backyard waiting for him as she often did when they were younger.  She still believes she's sixteen, though, and that they are still in high school.  When an Internet search reveals that she's been dead for three months, Carl begins to wonder what is going on.  A well written yarn.  Before I realized it, I was halfway through the book.  A fine easy read.

$review_text.: ***I was given a complimentary copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review for Nerd Alert Book Love blog***Rian has to be one of the most bada&& female characters in a book that I've read so far. Rian knew even from a young age that she was different,  an outcast. She spent her young years being bullied because her mom is a hippy, bullied for the way she dresses, bullied for her boyish name. Until she meets the new kid in town, Garrett. Her days become brighter because at the end of the horrible school day, Garrett was always there waiting. Until Garrett's Army dad got transferred to another base and they had to move away. At 13, Rian was heart broken and experienced her first big loss."...Everything that's happened in your life has led you to this point..."At 16, Rian's life suffers more hardship and tragedy when she loses her mother. Rian's life gets completely turned upside down when she has to move and go live with her Aunt. But little does Rian know that it will take another turn when her childhood friend Garrett walks right back into her life."...My raven is for me, not anyone else. It's a symbol of being able to be on my own - actually enjoying being alone..."Just when you think everything is slowly coming together for Rian, she suffers more tragedy in her life. And she is left alone and struggling with how to deal. She does the only thing she really knows how, she spreads her wings and flies."...I've proven to myself that I can do anything. In just a few short moments,  my most important fight erases the one from so long ago. It's such a freeing feeling..."Will Rian finally have a chance to put her life together?  Will she finally find her place in the world and her own happiness?  Or will she just lock away her feelings and get by?  What will happen when after years Garrett walks back into Rian's life again but she finds that sweet country boy is not the man he is today? Will Garrett let Rian back into his life at all or is that door closed for good? Will Rian's world come crashing down again or will she continue to spread her wings and fly?"...This is my life and this raven's no longer content with being alone and flying solo...""...This raven's found her home..."Ashley Suzanne has done it again! She has completely swept me away on an incredible journey full of so many ups and downs, twists and turns, that I sat on the edge of my seat and could NOT stop reading until it was done. I love Rian!  Her strength,  her courage, she moves me. I cried for her while reading even though she didn't.  And Garrett, oh sweet baby Jesus, he has made his way into the top rankings of my list of book boyfriends.  Yes please, I'd like to place an order for my own real life version of Garrett. Oh Ashley Suzanne,  you are brilliant! You completely floored me with the twists in this book and at the end, well NO spoilers, so I will just say absofreakinglutelyamazing! I wish I could give this book more than a Nerd Alert A+++ or 5 stars, they are just not enough! This is a MUST read this summer!

The thought an IED could take your life..or your limb..or multiple limbs is always with you..both in the day and in the darkest moments of sleep.Remember, all these casualties..with horrific wounds are volunteers....all volunteers with the idealistic approach to doing what is right for humanity and for our country.The American people and our government owe these wounded warriors whatever they may require..be is housing, education, mentoring, medical care (perhaps forever)..or anything that makes their life alittle easier.I cannot imagine personally of having lost both limbs..or more.  How I would deal with such a wound...only to ask the question(s) of "why" and "was it worth it".

I think that there is a really interesting character in there and there is potential for a really good book. This book was OK. I do not want to give anything away at all (as I was yelled at once before for doing that). Suffice it to say that it is a very easy read.

$REVIEW.: If you like British comedies, I am guessing you will enjoy this quirky book.  One of the characters is Florence, the leader of a group of ferrets.  And, there is also Lady Chatterley, a cat.  So, if you like books where animals play a role, this too may be a book for you.

$review_text.: Illumine Her is an excellently written and stunning tribute to Samoan culture.  Sieni has a talent for creating vivid imagery and vibrant strong characters.  It was a very interesting reading about a culture that I knew little about and I think I gained about 15 pounds just reading about all the delicious cuisine!  Check out the Pinterest link at the bottom of the post for excellent inspiration while reading.We follow Alana during a period of grief and self discovery to come out the other end a happy fulfilled woman.  It is a sweet clean romance between two honorable characters that leaves you satisfied and smiling.  There is also just a touch of "paranormal" in it to keep fans of that genre on edge wanting to know more about that mysterious Chase.  I'd like to get my hands on that Chase Malek myself!It is a very well prepared and edited novel.  I am very impressed this is a DEBUT!  There are elements that remind me of Nicole Williams' Eden Trillogy, if you are familiar with those books. The only thing that holds me back from a 5 for this book is that there is so much depth into the Samoan lifestyle, that it leave little to expand on the plot.  However, it IS a beautiful book and I enthusiastically look forward to more of Sieni A.M.'s writing!Full review here:[...]

$review_text.: DePalma evaluates the common historical experiences of the cultural and political entities that make up the North American Continent.  He likewise analyzes the similarities and differences between the three large geo-political entities of Canada, Mexico and the United States.Multi-Level RelationshipsDePalma skillfully considers the dynamics involved in the question of the geographical implications of the term "North American" versus the cultural and political ones.  He surveys the history of their societies and their politics, as well as the religious history of each entity and their complex interplay and multi-level relationships through history and currently.DePalma speaks out of an Italian-American background as an American journalist with an academic style.  He has lived in Mexico with his Cuban-American wife.  They also lived in Canada, where DePalma served as the Director of the New York Times' Canadian bureau.  DePalma himself traveled to far reaches and isolated locales in the great Canadian territories to learn about local culture, ethnicity, political views and economic patterns.Common OriginsHis astute observation and facile analytical ability have enabled him to present here an understandable three-dimensional portrait of the broad tapestry of communities in the three geographical North American giants.  With the sweeping changes pressed upon us in recent decades, the three countries often thought of as divided by continent-wide borders are now seen as three descendants of an early mix of invaders and indigenous, with different approaches to the somewhat common problems of their troubled heritage.I especially appreciated DePalma's ability to weave a tight multi-layered view between the events and trends of the past with the confusing rapid-fire of change in our recent era.  His presentation of the history of NAFTA is helpful, his analysis providing insights into the problems and the benefits of this complex agreement between the three great North American neighbors.Different IdentitiesIn regard to that designation as North Americans, DePalma hands us an updated portrait of the struggle for identity involved in this friendly yet antagonistic relationships across the borders north and south of the United States. As DePalma spins out the personal stories of the political and economic movers in the history of Mexico, Canada and the US, this sounds at times like a novel of international intrigue.There is life and fire in the story, readable as a political or economic analysis or simply as a fascinating human drama.  This is a fascinating cultural and economic analysis.  Any reader will learn a great deal of fact as well as perspective from a new comparative point of view, which is both analytical and sympathetic.DePalma writes between the expected lines of standard academic disciplines, with the authoritative flavour of personal relationships and astute academic investigation and analysis.

$review_text.: Wine Cocktails by A.J. Rathbun is excellent.  I was impressed with the many creative cocktails that can add variety to your Reds, Whites, and Roses.  I am new to wine tasting and explorations.  I have yet to make a trip to California to visit one of the many wine vineyards.  I have not even visited the one in Texas.  Now author Rathbun has inspired me to buy all the essential glasses, bar tools, and other ingredients necessary to make some of the delectable looking wine cocktails.  The rich colors and exquisite drink presentations displayed on the pages just jump out at you and make you want to taste it.  They say presentation is everything and the author went all out.  This book broadened my thinking about wine.  My personal trainer would not approve of all the calories from the fruit juices, syrups, sugar, etc.  He recommends drinking wine solo if you are watching your calorie intake and heart healthy advantages of red wine.  So it does not matter if you are a professional or home bartender, there are certainly many cocktails in this book that you will want to try.  Remember if you are counting calories...take it easy, but be daring and enjoy.

$review_text.: This is part of an interconnected series of short stories (the other two areZombie Tales: Primrose Court Apt. 205andZombie Tales: Primrose Court Apt. 502).  They don't have to be read in any particular order, as they tell the events of the day from the perspective of three different people who live in the same apartment building.What is interesting about the stories is that the zombies appear relatively late in all three of them.  This story features a man struggling with an unhappy marriage during the day the zombie apocalypse begins.  The story has a strongPsycho (1960)feeling to it.  I'd have enjoyed it more if it had been less derivitive, but such is life.I am pretty sure I read some earlier stories by this author that are now no longer available on Amazon.  If this is the case, he is developing quickly and I think he shows a lot of promise.  One issue that will need to be addressed is the number of typos in these stories -- it is simply unacceptable.  With some careful editing, I would gladly pay for the author's work.  Truly character-driven zombie fiction is rare.

$REVIEW.: I feel as though he is still in the betrayal  business. I had hopes of a nice biblical historical series, but found it was paranormal and true fantasy. The first book was so-so, but the other two went progressively down in my estimation. I did finish them all, though, but decided it was a waste of my time and his effort. I realize there is quite a market for this sort of stuff, (fairy tales for adults) but definitely not my taste. I would not suggest this book for anyone, unless I knew the person really liked it, and even then I feel it is not well written. This author goes on my no-no list.

$REVIEW.: This was one of the first Scratch programming books available and I purchased the original when it arrived in the U.S. The manual was produced by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, a fact that helps explain the mixed media approach to teaching Scratch. This edition includes support for the 2.0 version of Scratch which is Flash based. The mechanics of 2.0 versus the earlier 1.4 port are mostly the same.I very much like this book and it earnestly tries to make Scratch accessible to kids in an original and creative manner. Most other programming books, including other Scratch books, read like traditional texts. One approach is not necessarily better than another, however, and the comic book method works with some kids and not others. The mixed media format (switching between comics and instructional text) can be confusing for kids (and especially adults) that just want to know how something works.I think this book works best for kids in the 3rd to 5th grades. I've tested it with my kids and have found that in conjunction with a computer running Scratch, they get right to programming with minimal parental intervention. To push through the book, however, I find that a modest amount of parental assistance is called for.I want to also put a plug in for the No Starch Press which publishes this book. They have a great catalog of books for curious kids and kids who like to tinker. No Starch is carving out a niche as a high quality publisher of creative educational books for kids.

$REVIEW.: I'm being a little generous giving this 4 stars

 But, I really do think it's worth your attention

 Nimira catches your attention right from the start

 You can't help but understand her actions
 Parry is interesting as well
 You've never quite understand him (even after his secrets are revealed)
 I had a difficult time grasping the concept of falling in love with a fairy trapped in a machine

 It didn't seem real to me until later

 I also think there are some information gaps


 I think that author could have included a little bit more information on the world the characters  lived in and the events that lead up to the story

 I especially would have liked more information concerning the conflict between the faries and the humans


 I just felt like I didn't get enough background information


 The ending also seemed a little pieced together

 Still, the overall product was fun and I enjoyed it.

$REVIEW.: Just by looking at the cover I knew this book was going to be hot, I love the cover so much; so sexy. The synopsis is just another given that this going to be hot and I was not disappointed.This story about Kayla coming back to her mate that she left five years ago because of her fears, but her need to be with him brings her back. Being five years away from Jack for so long, that she finally realized that she wants and needs her mate completely. Jack first needs her to be sure and not fear him and leaving again, he will need her to show him, her submission and trust that there no going backing after the marking.I love Jack he is a true Alpha wolf. First you need to know I love my wolves and Jack is exactly the reason I love werewolves, so sexy that man is, damn. He is so strong and kind and more importantly the patience and love that he has for his mate that I found so irresistible.Jack and Kayla story was hot to best describe it and that hotness deserves five stars and I hope to hear similar stories like this and maybe make a series about it. So read it find hot how hot this book is and it a great deal for 99 cents, really well written, great story told with hot sex, and great characters; that tie it all together.

$REVIEW.: Over the years when I've had to defend the medium of comics to my less illuminated friends and co-workers I've been able to point to many examples of works that rise above the mire of the usual.  Things like "The Watchmen", "Bone", "Love and Rockets" and others.  I will now add "Deogratias" to this distinguished group.  The book is the product of Belgium writer/artist J.P. Stassen.  The book is told against the backdrop of the brutal ethnic cleansing that took place in Rwanda in the early 90's as the majority Hutu savagely butchered some 800,000 of the minority Tutsi ethnic group as the world looked on and did nothing.Stassen first provides a brief, but very necessary history lesson about the events that led up the genocide and what has happened after.  Stassen now resides in Rwanda with his family.  The book if required reading if only for Stassen's opening monologue and history lesson.  The story itself moves back and forth in time with the lead title character Deogratias.  These shifts in time come with no warning or captions and at first are a little dizzying but you'll soon have it figured out.  Deogratias in present time is a pathetic creature, wearing ratty clothing, and addicted to Urwagwa or banana beer.  He also seems to be quite mad as other villagers ask him if he is "still a dog?"  This will become significant later in the story.  We first seem him interacting with a French tourist who was in the military back during the genocide.  This character is meant as a representative of the French government who if they didn't actually back the horrors that took place, they turned their back as they went on.As we move back in time we learn about the past of Deogratias, a Hutu, and others of his village.  We see him in school as even the teachers spew hate against the Tutsi.  Deogratias is in love with A Tutsi girl named Benina but her mother wants Benina to have nothing to do with him.  The radio broadcasts are filled with hateful tirades against the Tutsi who they refer to as cockroaches.  Deogratias is expected to take up arms with his Hutu brothers but all he can do is think of saving Benina and her family.  Ultimately he will pay for this with his very sanity.Deogratias is a powerful, tragic, horrifying story.  Made all that much more terrible because of the real-life events and even worse by the world's complete lack of action to stop the violence.  Was it because this was black on black racism?  Was it because there were no strategic locations or oil fields as stake?  Whatever the case, This is a story that will haunt the reader for a long time.Reviewed by Tim Janson

$review_text.: This &#34;book&#34; is so poorly written and badly organized that I could not get through it.  Moreover, the information is fairly useless since most of it is common sense. For example, in the introductory chapter on boarding school faculty, Hillman takes up four pages to say that faculty members are people with all the flaws that other people have. Well, I knew that already. There is very little here that the average intelligent parent -- even without any prior experience with boarding schools -- could not figure out without anyone's help.  This book is not worth the price or the time to attempt to read it.

$REVIEW.: This book covers the sad topic of grief. I would have expected to have my tissues handy, yet Hayson Manning delivers quirky humour that creates the most uplifting story.Mason Christian, is grieving and has shut down everything but his drive for work. Billie, after caring for her dying ex husband, needs money to attain her dream of cooking school. Billie takes up a short term contract with Mason, who calls her 'forty-two' as he doesn't expect her to last. Billie doesn't complain, just calls Mason a different name every time she speaks to him. She's funny. She has a great zest for life. And this attitude makes this book such a pleasure to read. Not only does Billie's humour, attitude and sassiness make the book fun, it cuts through Mason's walls.Stanley steals my heart. He's an adorable, pine cone chasing, dog you can't help but love.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I look forward to the next Hayson Manning story.

Declan and Sadie grew up next door to each other, until a tragedy forced Sadie to move away. Years later, she moves back next door to Declan, after a breakup from her fiance. Declan tries to ignore his feelings for Sadie, but finds it impossible.Great ROMANCE, and Yes some naughty words and some sex in this one... so those who don't like those things be warned... But those of us who enjoy a great read like this one, do not pass this one up... it is fantanstic!It is a bit long, so before you start it make time to sit for a long while reading because you will not want to put it down.For those who like a strong kick azz Female character, in this book you have 3 of them.

$review_text.: 25 Essentials: Techniques for Planking offers 25 recipes involving cooking food on planks of wood.  Why?  Because the wood imparts delicious flavors to the food wherever it comes in contact.  This is a little different than using wood chips to cook, which give off much more smoke.The key 'techniques' the book teaches are how to select the right type of wood for planking and the right method of applying heat, of which there are many.  For those without a proper grill to cook with, all recipes have alternative cooking instructions for the oven (and some are strictly meant for the oven).Each recipe is laid out quite neatly with the ingredients (which are kept simple) on the left and instructions on the right.  Most recipes call for ingredients to be blended or simmered to make a sauce or marinade and then it's simple planking from there on out.  The recipes are easy enough for almost anyone and are referenced easily thanks to the spiral binding.The best part of this cookbook is the variety of recipes.  There are half a dozen recipes for cheese!  There are recipes for many types of fish, a few for other seafood, chicken, beef, pork, etc.Overall, 25 Essentials: Techniques for Planking is a thorough and easy to use cookbook.  I learned a lot about planking and have had some success with my first attempts.  While 25 recipes may not seem like a lot, I can see using almost all of them at some point.

$REVIEW.: I read this very quickly because it is a short read, however, it was rather confusing

 One minute they were discussing one thing and then all of a sudden there was switch in topic


 There was also a lot of repeating the same dialog throughout the book


 And where are the proofreaders - doesn't anyone read these books for typos and grammatical errors before they are published?  I lost track of the meaning of sentences several times because of errors in spelling or usage
 I probably will not buy any other books by this author although if she gets the right group helping her, I think the books would be a good read.

Now what, is the next story about a different Seductor or is Jades story continued.  I would think that each book should be a stand alone in and of itself.  OK, now for the good stuff.  This is well written, the characters jump off the page and the sex is hot, hot, hot.  I was held captive from beginning to end and absolutely fell in love with Jade and her target.  This would have been five stars if there had been some background on the Jade character.

I was not sure how a stranger could be such a friend to her and the family in the book, but he knew nothing of her.  I think the only thing they had in common was that they had been involved with AAA and that he had messed up his life.  I enjoyed reading it, I think there would be another book involved with the niece that had ran off with a guy that was much older for her and the fact that he was released from the prison.

$review_text.: From the first line of this book, I knew I was in for something special. It's a rare story that can hook you from the first sentence, but this book did just that. The voice in this story is one of the most relatable, honest, and downright enjoyable of any book I've read in a long time.The characters here are extremely layered. They talk, act, and even think like real people; especially real smalltown people (of which I am guilty of being one, so I guess I should know lol). The love story here is as genuine as everyhting else here; equal parts sweet, complicated, sad, and even tragic. The ideas of what we want, who we are, and even what we deserve are explored in deep, meaningful, and (most importantly) entertaining ways.I could not get enough of this book. The pacing was perfect, working its way up to a fever pitch with ease and never sacrificing the character building moments for the sake of the plot. The first chapter of this book gave me exceptionaly high hopes and I was thrilled to find that the reality of the story exceeded those expectations. Louise Caiola has earned a fan with this, and I cant wait to read what comes next from her!

But when I read about Brashares' first adult foray, it sounded like the right time to give her a shot. THE LAST SUMMER is just lovely. The writing tripped along as pleasantly as waves washing up on Fire Island. Main trio Alice, Paul, and Riley try to navigate their post-adolescent years while holding their difficult relationships intact. The quiet, clean writing fit the way the characters were moving into adulthood. Slowly. Reluctantly. If they must. The way we all do.

$review_text.: The subtitle for this book is "Everything you need to know to write, publish, promote and sell your own book," and it truly does cover everything. From getting your ideas, to writing, to taking your author photo, to securing ISBNs, to filing tax forms, to promoting your book- everything is covered here.I actually gave up on this book 36% in, because it was such heavy going. It's not the kind of book I recommend reading cover-to-cover, it is definitely more of a reference book. I would buy the paperback (because I much prefer hard copy non-fiction to Kindle non-fiction) and keep it on my desk as I wrote, referring to it at each stage throughout the self-publishing process, if I was anything more than a lowly reviewer!The book is very heavily focused on printing your book, and getting it into bookstores. That may have been fine in 2010, when this fifth edition was released, but I think it's a little out-of-date now. All self-published authors that I know personally are e-focused, and have largely given up on getting into bricks-and-mortar bookstores.It's also largely focused on non-fiction works, and is very heavily geared towards North American readers. I found myself asking more questions like "How would that work over here?" than I have with any other book or article on the subject.There is also a crazy amount of self-promotion in this book. The authors each have quite a few other titles to their names, and take every opportunity to hawk them.It's annoying, but a minor detail.Overall, I thought this book was a pretty decent reference book, if you're based in North America. It gets very technical, which I actually like- it's very in-depth on the printing process, for example. It covers every single aspect of the self-publishing process in incredible, accessible detail, but it's irrelevant to anyone outside the United States (perhaps the information applies to Canada, too, I don't know, but the authors do tell Canadian readers to basically do their own research into taxation), and fiction writers will have to search for the parts which are relevant to them.There is a lot of valuable information in this book, but if you are interested in buying it, I would wait until the next edition.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this book and could hardly put it down
It amazes me how three authors can write stories that go together, does one write first, then the second, then the last one or do they get together and plot the characters and certain 'events' that take place? These stories are about three friends and take place during the same time span."A Perfect Secret" is a story about Rose and Luke, lifelong friends and neighbors who are engaged

This is very intriguing since they have both joined the church and Rose thinks she knows Luke better than anyone until she goes for a walk in the woods and sees an Englischer in the dark


At first she's frightened, but when she hears him talk she knows it's Luke, but why is he dressed like an Englischer and why did he steal her blueberry pies she had sitting on the porch railing to cool, she knows he stole them because he has blueberry stains on his shirt

Is he the Robin in the Hood that has been stealing from everyone and what is he up to? Luke knows Rose when he sees her but doesn't realize that she recognizes him

When he kisses her, Rose wishes Luke would kiss her that way


Will they make it to the alter or will this 'strangeness' come between them."A Perfect Match" is the story of Naomi, older than most single Amish women, they are both afraid of love
Naomi tries to play matchmaker for her friend Margaret, as she did for her sister Priscilla
This matchmaking effort doesn't work as well as it did for Priscilla and her now fiance Chester
Margaret gets all tongue tied and klutzy around men, so when Naomi plans a dinner for Margaret and Zeke, Zeke thinks he's invited to have dinner with Naomi so is really disappointed but tries to make the best of the situation
Margaret gets so flustered that she runs out on the dinner without telling Zeke good by


Does Margaret learn to feel comfortable around Zeke, does Zeke fall in love with Margaret and what about Naomi, what happens to the matchmaker?"A Perfect Plan" ties it all together as it tells about everything that can go wrong and does go wrong while one couple is planning their wedding and their future together


Priscilla and Chester begin to second guess themselves about getting married because nothing is going along with the 'perfect plan' that Priscilla has


Chester has to deal with several mishaps to do with the house he's building for them, his brother breaks his wrist while working on the roof, Chester gets accused of stealing $200 from work, and loses his job

Priscilla starts getting hiccups frequently and soon connects them as a hint that something 'bad' is going to happen, all of Chester's troubles plus some of her own
Her little sister cuts up her wedding dress that she's just about finished stitching, she needed clothes, a hammock and blanket for her doll


Rose, one of her attendants is making beet jelly and forgets to use gloves so she has purple hands, she also comes in contact with poison ivy and she's highly allergic to it so she can't stop scratching
The biggest thing is that Chester can't find the marriage license two days before their wedding and is afraid to tell Priscella


Priscilla knows something is wrong but he refuses to tell her what so they start looking at everything that has happened and wonder, are they really supposed to get married
Lot's of things can happen in two days, guess you'll have to read it to find out if they make up, if they find the marriage license and if they get married.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com [...] book review bloggers program

$review_text.: This delightful story about two college students brings to the fore the fallacy of believing that you know what the other person is really thinking.  Neither student, although they have known each other since childhood understands that they are totally wrong in assuming that they know what the other one is thinking and wanting.  The story was easy to read, held a few surprises, and showed a depth of writing and caring about the college student phase of life.  Although the book was part of a series, it stood on it's own.  I had no difficulty in following the characters.  Since the college is a bible college, I was surprised that the Christian references were few and rather in the background and the story of the students was in the foreground.  I liked the emphasis on the idea that God can use you anywhere, it doesn't have to be the same place as where your hero was used.  That's the wonderful thing about the world, different people are needed for different reasons.  Recommended.Thank you to Tyndale House Publishers, Inc for the Kindle copy.

$REVIEW.: David James' novella about the origins of Magda the Witch swept me away from page one and didn't release me from its spell even after I reached the end. Magda is a character that intrigued me in the full novel Light of the Moon: the witch bound by a curse and driven by blood. In The Witch's Curse, you meet Magda as a girl and follow her through her transformation by blood. But more, the story is about fate, love, and sacrifice. The character Samuel - beautiful inside and out - struck a deep chord in me, and I fell for him as he fell for Magda. I won't include spoilers as to what was the ultimate fate of Samuel and Magda, but I will share one of my favorite quotes from this beautifully-written story:"...I understood; there was a price to pay for everything. We loved, we lost. We lived, we died. We smiled, we criedI closed my eyes against the violet of my curse -against hope."David James' writing style is truly unique. He has the ability to transport you to a different time and place, to sink you into his characters and make you experience their deepest emotions. This novella is a must-read if you read Light of the Moon. It's a must-read even if you didn't. It is a beautiful and stirring tale that may make you cry, yet still leave you with a fierce sense of hope at the end.

$REVIEW.: I absolutely loved this book! Ms. Royal has created a wonderful paranormal romance story and filled with fantastic characters, and intriguing plot line and given her readers a captivating read.Both Chance and Olivia had pasts that left them with the feelings and thoughts of being alone forever. Olivia was in a loveless marriage for 34 years, and Chance was blamed for his mother's death, and his father refused to get over that death. But, a chance encounter will leave both of them feeling differently.Chance, leader of his pack for the LIIA (Lycan International Investigation Agency), is after a rogue pack's leader. Thinking he may be hiding on the nature reserve's property, he takes on the role of Forester and often shifts to run the woods searching. Trouble is, he can never quite catch him. Especially after, while in wolf form, laying eyes on Olivia, his primal-mate. Chance and his wolf now have another powerful mission: to protect Olivia from the rogue.Olivia agrees to one final interference from her younger sister. At 55 and widowed after a 34 year loveless marriage, she's given up on dating men. Men are liars and she doesn't want anything to do with them. But, agreeing  to give in to her sister, she finds there's a whole more than just a chance meeting with a stranger set up by her sister! Chance has secrets, and is lying to Olivia, but for some reason she can read his psyche, which is unusual considering she's an animal sensitive. She knows he's hiding something but what? When something attacks her animals, Chance sets out to protect her, and she'll finally learn the truth. Will it change her feelings for him? Or will she take a chance on a forever love?I definitely recommend this book with 5 Books! With suspense of trying to catch rogue leader,steamy hot passion, and some sexy shifting werewolves, this story has it all, including humor. It's a wonderful start to a great new series. I loved the story line, and the complexity of Olivia and Chance's characters. I am so glad that I had the chance (no pun intended!) to review this book. I am a new fan of Ms. Royal's, and will be anxious awaiting the release of book two in this great new series. I'll be going back and reading her previous work as well :).*This review is based on a complimentary copy which was provided for an honest review*

$REVIEW.: Rarely have I enjoyed &#34;horror&#34; comics. With the exception of New Mutants, I really don't think I have ever bothered with a comic book franchise about a couple of kids.Boy was I missing out.I recommend this series (and author) to everyone I meet. From the first panel you are sucked in to their world and in short order you start to give a damn about the whole family (and the other characters). The villains are eminently hate-able, and yet you feel bad for them. The kids have seen pure horror but they keep trying and don't give up. The story is TIGHT, with excellent pacing, crisp dialog, and no off-notes.This is a book by a team (writer and artist) who care about their work and it shows in every single page.

$REVIEW.: Sam Taylor was leaving in town in three days, and she fully intended to seduce retired White Sox player Riley Scott before she did.  She owned a bar he frequented called the Diamond, but she never got any farther than flirting with him for the last two years, and she was tired of it.  Sam was losing everything that had meant anything to her, and before she left the Chicago area, she was going to take one good memory with her to her new life in New York, and that was a night with Riley.Riley had wanted the Diamond ever since being forced to retire from baseball, but was having pangs of conscience about how underhanded he had been to get it.  He went to his friend who was also Sam's financial manager, and asked him not to extend her loan.  He was in essence forcing the only friend he had ever had to give up what meant the most to her.  When she saw him that evening, he was shocked when Sam suggested they hit the sheets before she left town.  He had wanted her for years, and there was no way he could say no, but wondered what the fallout would be when she found out he was the reason for her being ruined.This story had a lot of action and steamy lovin.  Riley and Sam are both intense characters with a lot of baggage to work out individually, but between them also.  How can you forgive a betrayal that hurts that deep?

$review_text.: After finishing The Proposition, which left me hanging in that not-so-good place, I was eager to read its sequel.  I thought I could predict all that would happen in The Proposal, but I was pleasantly surprised!  Yes, Aidan and Emma reach their well-deserved HEA; however, Katie Ashley managed to write a very worthy sequel that is refreshing and fun with unexpected turns that I could have never predicted.One of the things I love about this series is how well the secondary characters are written.  As I mentioned in my review of The Proposition, Aidan and Emma's families and friends truly do make the story extra special.  From the way Aidan's young nephew's innocent curiosity about where babies come from, Casey's nicknames for Aidan, Connor's comical nature, and Granddaddy's secret * gasp * are just a few of the things that kept the story flowing!So, let's talk about Aidan and Emma!  I'm sure Aidan pushed a lot of buttons for many with his actions in The Proposition, mine included, but he sure doesn't waste time realizing his mistakes.  It is Emma that makes annoying mistakes this time around especially when handsome Dr. Alpesh Nadeen enters the picture.  The journey to forgiveness and love isn't without bumps on the road, but eventually Aidan and Emma get there.  Then they can't keep their hands off each other!  Yeah, I saw how excited Aidan (a.k.a. Mr. Super Potent Sperm) was about those...ahem...handcuffs!  These two are pretty insatiable together.As for Pesh, well, he certainly makes up for being really creepy and weird in the beginning.  He turned out to be one character I can't wait to see get his own HEA in The Pairing.Overall, The Proposal will leave you in that warm and happy place.  If you long to have a baby one day, it will leave you feeling hopeful.  If you already have kids, it will evoke feelings and memories of the sounds, smells, joy and excitement of holding a precious newborn! :)

$review_text.: While I read a great deal of SF this story is heavily on the side of spacefaring war and military hardware. This makes it difficult for me to get into and that is why I am not giving it more stars, but a person who wants exactly the above out of a book will doubtless love it and appreciate the details a lot more than I did.A war is raging in space between two cultures on a quasi-religious basis. Like the Conquistadores the mission 'to convert' is more likely to kill and subjugate other races believed to be lesser because of skin colour or other factors. Males and females appear to have equality in the ship we first meet; unfortunately this is reflected in the women of status acting like men of status in bygone days, ordering the ensign boy to their cabin. Senior Lieutenant Nadia Tinor discovers that a rebellious President has been arrested and frozen in a stasis container for many years unknown to most people; now with battle damage and a revolt on board ship, the lady may have to be restored to life.All of this takes some picking out of the pages of descriptions of spacefaring history and politics, unfamiliar names bombarding us and orders being given by people we don't know. The tense shifts between past and present from sentence to sentence within a paragraph; from has to had and will to was or is.  This gives the book the feeling of having been translated from a language which does not like to use the conditional tense.  Combined with many new terms before we get involved in a person's story and little explanation of each term as we go, the feeling of paddling on the surface of the book, rather than diving deeply into it, remained with me.Amusingly there are some familiar terms too such as dragoons, marine fusiliers and troopers. Other terms such as boomer make themselves clear; that one is a PA system on board ship. Italian-derived words such as mezzanine and gelato make an appearance and after all that space dust and electrical wire smoke, who wouldn't want a nice gelato?  Such moments come across as very human.Just as we were having a nice sit down however, discussing cattle breeding and cinemas, the book abruptly went into another political history lecture, from which straight to the index. I missed any real ending.I'm not the best person to comment on the military machine and warfare described in this book, but 'Midshipman's Hope' by Feintuch it's not, nor is it 'Use of Weapons' by Banks.  I got into both of those books no problem and really enjoyed them.  If you also read those but would like to take the details of war in space further, with race and religion thrown in as motivations, this book and the series which follows could well be for you.

$REVIEW.: I read the teaser, and it sounded funny, so I got it. Very disappointed. Did not like the style of switching between characters, it was so disjointed. It was also very short. the idea was good, but once I got into it, I didn't like any of the characters, and the plot was not thought out, the main device the author used was to gross out the audience. Too bad a good author couldn't use the original idea of a ghost looking for it's murdered body.

$review_text.: Based on the title, I thought I'd start this book, realize it was as stupid as it sounded and delete it. I mean, "The Man Who Killed Santa Claus"? Really? And a love story to boot? Impossible!Well, surprise, surprise. Here I sit, having finished the book without once considering abandonment. Additionally, I'm bawling like a baby. Granted, it doesn't take much to get me sniffling, but this is tissue-grabbing, "I don't believe this" crying.The story is strange, but in a good way. Original? I'd say, "Definitely!" I didn't know where it was going. Then I thought I knew and it kept going. I'm not a writer (and don't think I could be), so I appreciate what I imagine is the time and thought required to put together a story with originality and unpredictability.As I was getting toward the end (percentage-wise on my Kindle I could tell), I started to think about the book's "legacy". There was one "ending", but the book wasn't finished. And then another... was this too much? Too over the top? (I'm trying not to be a spoiler). When all is read, I think not. There was a lot, but I think overall it was satisfying and coincidental (in the best sense of the word) rather than contrived. I don't "re-read" books, so I wont be going back to analyze the connections. The ones I noticed were (to me) happy accidents. And I found myself saying, "I see what you did there" to the author.I feel I must also say that although I have read my share of "award winning" literature, I am too far removed from my analytical literature classes to appreciate much of the more pretentious novels. This is definitely NOT one of those and is very accessible. There were a couple typos requiring a back track for the missing or incorrect letter (I think one was something like, "may" instead of "many"), but overall, for me, it was a great read. Thank you!

$REVIEW.: Pop Culture Magick, like pop culture itself, is right on the edge of the known and the unknown, an explosive idea which only the few (at first) may really understand, let alone let bring into their lives.  Most magicians tend to dig the hidden mysteries passed down to us from such epic masters as Crowley and Dion Fortune (just to name a couple), but in so doing ignore the great storehouse of magickal energy available that has been built into various pop culture icons.  This book seeks to explore that storehouse and to give us clues and working advice as to how to do it for ourselves.  And why not?Very readable, friendly, and practical, Pop Culture Magick is a real find.  It explores how magick works, how we can tap into it, and how movies, books, television shows, even advertising can be used to create dynamic entities for magickal exploration and ritual.  After all, hundreds if not thousands if not millions of (unsuspecting) people have freely poured their attention and energy and emotion into fictional characters and universes...why not make our own good use of that rather than just allowing the engines of corporate commercialism use it to sell a few more million hamburgers or shiny new cars?Any metaphor can work if we are emotionally attached to it, or can make ourselves emotionally attached.  And pop culture is all around us, just raring to go and already etched into our psyches.  It is ever evolving, just as magick is ever evolving, though we can use our ancient techniques to tune into it.  It can work, because we believe it can work.Just as any religion can work, even those based off of fiction.  Which is what this book also delves into--the fantasy stories of Storm Constantine and how you can base a spiritual/magickal path off of them.  Shades of Robert Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, anyone?  Certainly, this is right in line with how the Church of All Worlds came into existence.  Which proves the author's point, that what we call fiction or mere entertainments can come to mean more than that if we are willing and able to work with them, if there is enough emotional umph behind them, and our minds are not closed to the range of possibility.This is a book I didn't know I'd been waiting for until I found it.  I can't hardly wait for a sequel!

$REVIEW.: Paranormal romances are not the norm for me, but this one grabbed my interest quickly and kept me interested to the very end.  Finding a supply of the secret ingredient needed for her company's incredibly successful cosmetic product, our heroine, Clare, is drawn to France and to handsome, sexy Laka, (our hero). Laka promises Clare that he will help her get the ingredient she wants, but she needs to help him get into an alternate world where the evil mistress of that world is trying to lure Laka and his "butler" Pablo for her own devious purposes.  Why is her grandmother (whom Clare believed had died two months earlier)in this alternate world, and why will Laka never touch her when she knows he is drawn to her, just as she is drawn to him?  I highly recommend Cursed Kiss as your next paranormal romance read.

$review_text.: My first thought when I finished reading Emotional Geology was masterpiece. Beautifully written and deeply moving, it's the story of a woman with bipolar disorder who is trying to start afresh after a traumatic relationship break-up and the resultant mental breakdown.Rose, a textile artist buys a cottage on Uist, a remote Scottish island, and meets Callum, a poet, teacher and the younger brother of her neighbour Shona. Rose wonders why this handsome, charming forty year old is alone. Though there are hints before hand, the truth only comes out in the final chapters where he reveals his scars both physical and mental in some very powerful writing.The reason for Rose's breakdown is revealed in scenes of past events.  As the story progresses, we discover the full extent of her betrayal by her ex-partner Gavin, and follow her inner journey as she endeavours to cast off his ghost and open herself to the possibility of new love.This is a multilayered work with a brilliant use of poetry and descriptive imagery using the language of textiles eg colour, texture, weight and movement qualities, as described through the eyes of a textile artist. The descriptions of Rose's all black textile response to Callum's poem, Basalt, is exceptional. I saw the piece as if it hung on the wall before me. The description of the gold and white piece was similarly evocative and it's brightness a fitting and highly symbolic balance to the black hanging on the opposite wall.As with all of Linda's work, the characterisation was exemplarary, especially the sensitive and realistic description of Rose in a manic phase. I loved the parallel drawn between the manic and creative state, something reinforced by Rose's creation of a work of art as a way of coping with a major trauma.Gillard uses different points of view, first and third, well to give different degrees of intimacy to different scenes. I loved the rhythm created by the different lengths of scenes separated by gaps of time, especially during the party where the various snippets give the vague disjointed experience of someone who had drunk just a little too much.This is, without a doubt, a 5 star work and one that all lovers of contemporary fiction and romance should read. Also if you like symbolism in stories and lots of layers of meaning to unravel, then you'll love this.

$review_text.: I don't know where to begin. Should I mention that this novel is undoubtedly spectacular? Or should I say, this "debut" novel is remarkably spectacular? I haven't read a book that has affected me on an emotional level in quite a while. Not like this. The Medea Complex will provoke your thoughts, make you question everything you classify as crazy, and even leave you speechless by the end of the story. Because by then you'll be kicking yourself saying, "I should have seen this coming."Let's start with the writing, and I have to take a moment to sign and collect my thoughts. It was just absolutely wonderful. The way Rachel captured the setting, the scenarios, every single emotion, was done in such a flawless way. I couldn't stop reading; word after word pulled me in deeper. I love historical fiction mostly having to do with romance, so I must admit that I was a bit apprehensive about going into this one, especially with the creepy blood-splattered girl on the cover and the premise upon which the story is built. Nevertheless, I'm so glad I went in with an open mind. This is historical like no other, guaranteed to leave you shivering.In regards to the characters and different POVs, it all made sense. I usually get thrown off when there's too much narrators but in this case, it works. I was given the chance to enter the minds of each individual significant to the plot. From start, Anne came off as the innocent wife who went insane. I sympathized with her situation, and at the same time was angry with her. After all, she murdered her child. At least, that's what was presented at start.When Dr. Savage entered the story, he depicted the characteristics of a man trying to cure the madness, like most individuals in his profession. He worked hard to separate his hospital from the stigmas associated with asylums, by using lesser painful methods in addressing ones insanity. There were times I found him compassionate, considerate, a straight up good doctor. And there were times I found him too naive and ignorant to certain things, especially when it came to Anne's interest in books. But I guess you have to understand that in the particular era, society was crazier.As for the other characters, more specifically Anne's husband, Edgar, had I not been able to get into his head I would've deemed him as an unkind husband and possibly blame him for everything that had happened. However, I liked him. He was strongly influenced by the selfishness of his own father to place himself in a situation where the consequences would be deadly. I literally felt the pain during his final scenes and almost envisioned myself in his place. That's how convincing the story was. Then again, its all not too far-fetched from actual events.I don't want to go on any further for I fear I might give away too much. However, I will say this one last thing, Rachel Florence Roberts is a terrific author who has written a story not only dark and intriguing, but focuses on an issue, medical and criminal, still present in today's society. I commend her for writing such a great book and look forward to her next novel.

$REVIEW.: As I read through the book, I found much of his research in depth, and his passion to share this is equal to the work and sacrifice he put into this book
 From the basic foundation of America and Christianity, to the roots placed against the church and politics, David shares his concerns and the destruction of Judeo-Christian principles now being displaced in America today.Through his effort, his desire is through this book to reach out to draw America, and the church, back to the foundations that made her strong, and his heart to see her blessed by God once again

$review_text.: A fantastically well-told story that grabbed me from the first chapter

Gil is just trying to drive home when another car on the highway starts messing with him


 Parts of the story are from the point of view of the bad guy and gives you a glimpse into his head
This did a great job of ratcheting up the suspense and made me want to keep reading


It showed just how crazy he was and still kept you wondering
Definitely creepy
There is a bit of a romance, which was a nice plus, but didn't overpower the thriller aspect of the story
I enjoyed the characters as well
I highly recommend this one.

$REVIEW.: This is the first book in a series about the life and times of Belle Boyd, the "Confederate Cleopatra".  This book is "Historical Fiction" meaning the book follows history and the author adds in details and dialog.  The next book is "Alternate History", meaning the author makes assumptions that cannot be supported by the historical record.Francis Hamit has a good grasp of the manners and attitudes of the people and the era.  This makes his dialog ring true and the activities realistic.  Belle Boyd is not typical of her sex or her times.  History supports the story this book tells.  A simple goggle search will allow you to check on people and places.  Belle Boyd did kill a Union soldier.  She carried messages and spied for the Confederate States of America.  During a battle, she did run through the Union lines to tell Stonewall Jackson the situation he faced, allowing him to act with confidence.  Detained, check, watched Belle continued to work giving quality information.Reading this book teaches us 19th Century spy craft and gives us a look at the Confederate Secret Service.  A strong point is the treatment of Afro-Americans.  They are real people with divided loyalties.  Some support the Confederacy becoming important players in Belle's network.  Other welcome the Union army, provide information and spy for them.  This is not the "normal" view of things but is accurate.Belle slept with a Union Officer, the book covers this in detail.  Their encounters are descriptive, detailed and complete.  I cannot recommend this book for anyone but an adult.  If you find this upsetting, you will not enjoy this book.  This is not the majority of the book but it is an important part of it.I should like this book more than I do.  It is historical, true to the times and the people.  Somehow, the book never "caught fire" for me.  It is an enjoyable and worthwhile read but the story or the characters never captivated me.  Subtract one star if you do not like sex in your historical fiction.  Add one star if you wish the South had won the war.

$review_text.: This book was a disappointment to me. The authors claim that much of the New Testament was originally written in Hebrew and they spend much of the book attempting to prove that axiom. While they did present a "reasonable" case, they did not even come close to proving it. First, they assume way too much. Second, there are no surviving documents to support their claim. Third, there are surviving documents from the early (1st or 2nd centuries) which are in Greek. Fourth, if what the authors claim is true, then it seems certain that someone from the many, many, many saved souls from the distant past, would have spoken up and written about this. Yet, there are not any similar claims from the ancient past. Fifth, the true early Christians would have been extremely careful about transferring and copying words in the same language that the New Testament was originally rendered. They would not have allowed mutated translations to have survived without making a comment about them somewhere in their many, many writings and commentaries. Lastly, a translation is a "carrying over" of words from one language to another, NOT a transfer of thoughts (the way modern so-called translators create new versions). The transfer of thoughts necessarily requires interpretation. Interpretation is steeped in assumption. That is why it is best to transfer words word-for-word, language to language as it was done until the third century AD when certain heretical individuals (Origen, Jerome, etc...) began to make changes to the original manuscripts. Obviously, even the word-for-word translations have problems and that is why Christians need to study Greek and Hebrew. This book would have been very helpful and interesting if the authors had only written about Hebrew idioms that show up in the New Testament. Clearly, the first century folk spoke and wrote Hebrew (as well as Greek and Aramaic) and as a result they often "thought" in Hebrew. When you grow up in a multi-lingual culture, it is natural that one language's idioms might spill over into other languages. As for the word order argument that the authors passionately claim supports their premise, they conveniently forgot to mention that word order is very flexible in Greek, so their argument is invalidated.

 It is utterly straightforward and practical

In a thoughtful way, Jamie and Maren practice what they preach, articulating their message  with graciousness, high integrity and clarity.This is not so much a book of advice as a book of examples, organized in a way that helps us understand where we commonly stumble
 In every chapter, there is a little gem that makes one wonder--"Now why didn't I think of that?"  But that's the magic: they see through the fog of convoluted, sugar-coated, and manipulative communication
 Then they articulate and demonstrate how to to do it better


I have already shared it with friends and each of us has already put the ideas to good use


 It's a lovely piece of work.

$review_text.: This book is a fantastic read for anyone who is an already established small business owner, or anyone who is just starting out. From your hourly rate to offers, price bracketing and using the Internet to advertise, this great book offers lots of really helpful advice.I received a copy of this book for review purposes, but owning a small online business myself, am pleased to say that I have found it very useful. The information is broken down into helpful chapters each covering a specific topic. This breakdown is very helpful and allows you to really understand an area before moving on.The writing is very clear and easy to understand. It is obvious that the author has a lot of experience and his passion for the subject is clearly visible throughout the entire book.This book really gives you an insight into how to make your business successful and the best ways of achieving that. It encourages you to create achievable goals and reveals different marketing channels that you could utilize, for example, social networking sites.I do not usually enjoy this kind of `self help' book offering advice as I usually find them too information heavy and hard to read. However, `21st Century Tactics' shares all the important points and relevant information without babbling on or going off on a tangent.I have found this book to be very helpful and will definitely be continuing to implement some of the tips it talks about in my business. I would definitely recommend this to people who are thinking about starting a small business, as well as those who already own a small business, as I feel it can be beneficial to both groups.It is easily deserving of a 5 star rating.

The author should not be penalized for that; decide for yourself if Kiteley is a good writing coach for you. I have several other books of idea prompts, and I also journal. In the final analysis, if a person can't think of anything to write about, writing may not be the optimum medium of self-expression for him or her.

When I read that it was part of a trilogy, I was worried the author would leave me hanging...he didn't, and I appreciate that.

$REVIEW.: Right from the opening, you can feel the correctness of the outline Tarah offers regarding the emotional pitfalls surrounding our perceived imperfections and the self-aversion that follows.  After giving a brief outline of the process, she goes on to offer a number of Buddhist- centric therapeutic recipes for awareness, tolerance, and accommodation.My complaints are simple - I wanted more insights and examples regarding self-aversion, and I wanted less Buddhism.  Tarah has penetrated deeper than most self-esteem books, taking us close to where the issues arise.  But at the very moment we close in, that's it, no more is offered, and we are left wanting.  I felt that at the very least she should have reinforced the concepts with more complete examples.Drawing on Buddhist foundations, Tarah offers us gentle solutions to our predicaments.  For me, this seemed to dilute the message rather than strengthen it.  For such an important topic, the book need better cohesion and focus.Nevertheless, I this book points us in the right direction and gives us some measure of guidance regarding shame and self-avoidance.  For that I am grateful.

$REVIEW.: This was a fun short story featuring Hannah and Leo. Hannah had been taught that a wife's duty was basically to just tolerate her husband. She had never experienced any personal pleasure from sex and didn't even know it was possible. When Leo offers to teach her a thing or two, she realizes she wants to know everything.This was a quick, easy read told from Hannah's point of view. The story flowed smoothly, the characters were likable, and the sex scenes were sensual. I think the author did a great job with the setting descriptions and the vocabulary of the characters, making them seem real to the time era. I also liked the timeframe of the story. Rather than having everything happen in a few short days, it was drawn out so their relationship was able to develop over time; not an easy thing to do in a novella.Overall, I enjoyed this story and will be looking for more from this author.

$review_text.: No wonder this story won awards


It's essentially the distillation of Resnick's long list of Africa-centric fiction into a tale of Earth, set in the putative starting-place of man, and telling in a series of six vignettes, of the long rise of man in the universe.Not the best views of man, though, but snapshots of malevolence in a path of viciousness, murder and cannibalism, slavery and rebellion, greed and cruelty that sees a future Earth empty (perhaps) of all man's achievements

Even so, the tale is told by a research mission, aliens come to Earth to view the birthplace of mythical Man, who had conquered and plundered the galaxy in the same way he did in the vicinity of the Olduvai Gorge before his extinction.You may not agree with the arc of this tale, or even of the story told by Resnick's entire Out-of-Africa oevre


But it's hard to ignore the stellar purity and power of the way he tells it.

$REVIEW.: A sweet, romantic story that starts making you wonder where things are going, while in the back of your mind you have the inkling of what's going on while poor Cal doesn't


The story moves back and forth from present day to 10+ years in the past, but does it in a way that only boosts the story, which as readers know is very hard to pull off


The shift in time and place is written so perfectly that you feel that you are there with the characters as things are happening.Cancer gets a whole new face in this book, and when you realize just what I mean you find yourself within the shift of the book


Sweet, wholesome then tragedy
You ache with Cal throughout the book, when he is finding his way in his youth and when he's come to realization in his adulthood


Sylvie becomes a permanent fixture, even if only in his memories.This is not just a sweet romantic book
This is a thriller, suspenseful and sexual book mixed in with all the rest


There are times that you will find yourself blushing as you read it
Actually, there is sometimes just way to much description in the sexual trysts
I don't think it was all needed, I don't know if there was a push for the author to provide more of it, but a little less would have sufficed.You will find yourself rooting for Cal and his Lenore but also wondering if there is too much of a good thing going and will it be all taken away

When you think that the end of the story is coming, you will get pulled in a whole new direction and wonder if this is it
Not just for the story but for the happiness of the couple.There are surprises throughout this book


Layers upon layers of stories


What is the truth? Where will the story take you? Will there be a happy ending or will there just be more sadness?I recommend this book to readers from the ages of 18+


At first I would have recommended to those younger, but the sexual descriptions are just too mature for younger readers
This is a book for the hopeless romantic in all of us.

$review_text.: Edenbrooke is the perfect summer romance. This jewel has been setting on my shelf for almost a year and I finally picked it up thanks to my cousin, Charlie, and my friend, Michelle. As soon as I finished it, I had to ask myself "What the hell took me so long?" It was utterly fabulous. I enjoyed every single second of it and it was a more entertaining version of an Austen novel. The plot was great, the characters were fantastic, and the love story was simply swoon worthy.From their very first encounter, it is clear that Philip and Marianne have something special-even if they haven't quite realized it. While their chemistry is instantaneous, their feelings develop more slowly at a natural pace (no insta-love here!). I adored reading their scenes together and I am still a little crushed that I've finished the story--I need more of these two and I may even re-read the novel since I enjoyed it so much.The supporting characters were also very well done. I loved Marianne's complex relationship with her sister (you guys know I'm a sucker for a good sister story), as well as her grandmother and father. The emotional complexity that Donaldson was able to convey in this story was outstanding. There were many scenes that my heart just broke for Marianne and her family.There are so many times when a book revolves around a love story so much that it becomes the plot. Nothing really happens and you're just reading about characters that you've likely come to know and love. Edenbrooke did not have this problem and that is one of the reasons I loved it so much. Even though a large chunk of the book is devoted to Philip and Marianne, there is still a mystery to figure out and a healthy dose of danger on top of the typical intrigue involving inheritances that are typical for novels taking place during this time period.Edenbrooke is a fantastic novel. It has it all: love, mystery, and danger. Those looking for an epic romance with a great plot need look no further. I absolutely adored this novel and cannot wait to read more from Julianne Donaldson in the future.

$REVIEW.: Douglas Wilson's book, 5 Cities that Ruled the World, about how major cities throughout time (Jerusalem, Athens, Rome, London, and New York) shaped global history is a fascinating read. I can't say that I know enough about each city to identify any possible bias regarding their histories, and I'm little surprised at the exclusion of some cities, namely Constantinople, but I think that this is a great book for understanding world history.Each city's story is contained within one chapter. Things that are revealed about each city include its history (origin, major leaders, and wars and other events), its effect on the world stage, and its current state.I found that the chapter on London contained the most "unknown" information. I guess perhaps I just didn't know much about London history, especially the *very* early years (did you know London burned 15 times before the year 1300?!?).My only real complaint with the book has nothing to do with its content, and instead is an issue with the materials. I can't stand what the cover is made of--it's a paperback, made of a textured paper, and I find it weird to touch. Other than that, the book is a great tool for learning more about our world's major cities, and how they shaped the society in which we currently live, even from across the centuries and around the globe.

$REVIEW.: A love story

Arabella &#34;Bella&#34; is in London  to help with her niece's season

 Meriick has decided it is time to settle down and find a wife


 It took Arabella longer to understand the feelings she had for Merrick as being love, but he remained patient while their friendship grew  stronger

 Merrick's explanation of how and why he took care of his illegitimate siblings added a dimension to honesty to their relationship as well as a touch of reality to the plot
I liked that despite her loveless first marriage and other things in her past, her self esteem and confidence grew
 I enjoyed this book.

Your outlook will never be the same as you explore the ministry potential of a dynamic group of "women helping women," and catch their vision to be women committed to Jesus Christ, obediently seeking God's will, and fulfilling their life mission as Christ-followers.My Review:In reading A Place to Belong, Out of Our Comfort Zone and Into God's Adventure, took me back to a time in my life, sometimes even today, where I struggled to "belong." I've never felt "welcomed."Lisa Troyer and the comments from several women in the Circle of Friends Group share their experiences of finding a place to belong.If you have struggled throughout your life of wondering where you fit in, then A Place to Belong is a book that will encourage and uplift you to know that you have always "belonged" if you are in Christ Jesus.This book is a wonderful reference to have in your library.Disclosure of Material Connection- I received A Place to Belong: Out of Our Comfort Zone and Into God's Adventure by Lisa Troyer for free through The B &B; Media Group.

$REVIEW.: This book was probably the most heart wrenching one for me

Maybe a little because I knew the end was coming and also because of how Heven grows up in this book! In the previous she was immature, a little whiny, and a little frustrating at times


In this book she is becoming a strong young woman trying to find her way and dealing with life without Sam, her mom, and the continuous attacks


Then comes Riley! I have to admit that for a time I was team Riley, but I just couldn't stop loving Sam, and neither could Heven! Riley and Heven are both strong characters and sometimes you feel pulled between them and then Sam pops back up and it's a three-way tug-of-war with your emotions


This book was a serious emotional roller coaster for me and I loved every minute of it!

$REVIEW.: It took me about half the book to get into the story. It was almost too light and fluffy, and nothing much was happening. There were also some editing problems. Jack's constant use of "doggies" for the babies got irritating. "Shin" is not a place on a woman's back, and chocolate fudge pecan pie is usually known as German chocolate pie. From what I've seen, a fractured pelvis is not usually set. It is left to heal on its own or requires surgery. There were several puncuation errors and word misuses, like "not" for "now." The point of view changed suddenly in places, and there were all-knowing comments, such as "Before the interview was over he would know." There was one sentence I never did figure out the meaning. It read, "She opened her eyes and before she said the words, he believed her live." Nothing I could guess made sense with the story.Despite these small problems, I ended up liking the book. It won't go down as a favorite, but it entertained enough for a short time. I appreciated the fact there was no sex or heavy profanity, although things were still steamy at times. It delivered a light, simple read, and sometimes that's okay.

$REVIEW.: In the city of King's Port, Stella Lockhart is on the roof of her building about to jump to her death. She wants the pain to disappear, she wants to make it better, she wants to reunite with her mother and brother again. But a strange man sitting on the same ledge stops her by jumping off first, changing her entire world  and everything she thought she knew, forever.Girl Meets Underworld has all the fun stuff I like in my paranormal reads. Vampires, Werewolves and the human girl stuck in the middle of an age-old grudge.To be perfectly honest, if your looking for something different in this genre, then you may be disappointed since this isn't anything I haven't read before in other books. But if your anything like me who just simply likes reading another take on this lore, then you should find this escape quite entertaining.Jess Watkins writes a ruthless and almost unforgiving story about a girl who never knew that Vampires and Werewolves even existed, but  gets thrown into both their dangerous worlds and ends up caring greatly for both.I really enjoyed these characters. They're well developed and don't ever do what I expected.Stella is the kind of protag that is very strong minded. I love the way she reacts. She knows that Vampires and Werewolves aren't suppose to be real, but yet here they are, taking over her entire world. I love that she's curious but cautious. I also love that it's not insta-love and she doesn't automatically fall to their feet. Friendships are established first which was nicely refreshing.The second we meet Conner we can feel that calculating but smooth tone that breaths mysterious, alluring and dangerous. Conner is the type of guy that you can't help but like instantly. He's charming, kind, protective and has a fun playful side that makes me smile.Will is a little harder to understand. He's more of a puzzle. Has a cruel brother, seems to get pushed around a lot but you can tell he cares for Stella. Both guys are great, but I already have my favorite.The only character that I didn't care for was Stella's long lost father. He was controlling and bad tempered in the beginning of the story, but he seemed genuinely glad to have his daughter back in his life. But as the story moves on, his true nature is revealed making him down right awful and even terrifying. I was a little upset with this character-change up, in fact, I had to walk away. Now this isn't a bad thing, in fact, any book that can make me feel that strongly, is always a good thing. It means it made me care.All in all, Girl Meets Underworld is a promising beginning to a new series.  I ended up enjoying what this book had to offer. The writing is well done, the storyline is intriguing, fast paced and suspenseful. I liked the very sweet charming love story and the twist in the end makes me look forward to the next installment.

$REVIEW.: This book changes Christianity. Like Water Bearing Fish--the end of the Age of Pisces into the Age of the Waterbearer, Aquarius--Christianity is more coherent and true. New Testament studies at colleges and seminaries across the globe should lose accreditation if the advances in knowledge mentioned in this book are not discussed and taught on their campuses.The narrative style is challenging. There were a number of typos in the version of the book I read. Some assertions put forth may not persuade and are not advances. Nevertheless, what the author gets right is tectonically important for understanding the Works of Josephus and the New Testament. It is so also for Christian theology, Latter Day Saints theology, and Muslim theology that is tied to Jesus.Objective Hebrew Studies are also enriched here. That point is arguable to the extent that within Hebrew Studies, Queen Helena is thoroughly explored. What Ralph Ellis writes about Queen Helena in this book is monumentally important.At Marble Collegiate Church, former pastor Dr. Arthur Caliandro used to have an annual trialogue sermon: a Jewish minister (rabbi), a Christian minister (himself), and a Muslim  minister (imam). Queen Helena is monumentally important to the Judeo-Christian dialogue, for she had an "only begotten son." The theological discussions between Jew, Christian, and Muslim are at a groundbreaking moment.Part of the 40% completion of the search for the historical Jesus is to be found in a book I only reviewed as being worthy of two stars. How this book earned its two stars can be found by the chapters that earned an A-, A, or A+.

$review_text.: Interesting perspective, but the materials tend to be repetitive and have a "patched-together" feel. The scarcity of records on these servants may be the cause of it, the effect, though, is an ironic one. The "thinly" portrayed lives of the servants almost reinforce the snobbish views of their masters, Virginia Woolf in particular, that their lives are insignificant.Several "slips" also demonstrate how the materials taken from various sources are not well integrated. For example, on p. 270, the author mentions a friend "Morgan Forster". This "Morgan Forster" is no other than E.M. Forster. The passage must be directly taken from Woolf's diary or letters. Morgan is always the way she addresses him but "Morgan Forster" would not mean anything to most readers. Same thing happens on p. 287, the "Tom Eliot" who goes to church is actually T.S. Eliot!  It is inexcusable that the editors did not catch these.

$REVIEW.: Hazlitt probably did not have fun writing this book. After all a chapter by chapter refutation of the General Theory means that one has to actually read the General Theory first...Since only a part of the General Theory has been adapted to modern mainstream thinking, Hazlitt goes through a lot of nonsense that hasn't been relevant for decades. But there are some really juicy parts in this book that make it worth the read. Whether it's the magic of the multiplier, how Say owns Keynes or when it's just so ridiculous it's almost funny.Obviously there's nothing funny here, since to many Keynes is still the ultimate maestro of macro. These people should read this book, because this book documents almost every Keynesian fallacy that there is, and certainly the most relevant ones.

I have read a couple of other Delaney Rhodes novels and this one did not disappoint.  I loved the characters and thought that the plot was a whole new take on the "vampire books".  This book is certainly not meant to be confused with other vampire books because it is not a tween story but rather a story for mature adults.  I loved that the story was written from two perspectives as I think it takes the book to a whole different level.  Go now, and get this book on your Kindle because at $1.99 this book is a bargain!!  :)

$REVIEW.: That was one of the most incredibly emotional literary journeys I have been on yet. And it was worth every second. I adored this book. While I have no experience with cutting, I do respect that it's a real struggle for a lot of people. And as a working mother, I can relate to how hard it is to raise children. How very much it takes out of you. As much as I love my babies, I thank God daily that I have a job to go to that gives me a time and place to be me. Natalie didn't have that.This book dealt with real serious issues: PTSD, trying to be a good mother/wife, depression, grief, loneliness and love. I don't know how she did it, but Andrea Randall did an amazing job with these issues and characters. I will be recommending this book to my mommy friends especially. Great book!!

$review_text.: Carol Van Atta's book, I Kissed a Dog -Werewolves of the West, was one of those books that completely shocked me. I admit that when I saw the title I Kissed A Dog, I was expecting a funny quick read, but I was pleasantly surprised at how great the book was. I absolutely loved the way that Van Atta brings the paranormal aspects of werewolves and vampires into the story and blends it seamlessly with the human world. There are a lot of characters to follow, but they all play their part and are well developed so you never feel as if the author just added a character as filler. I Kissed a Dog has everything a paranormal romance reader wants in a book. You've got vampires, werewolves, murder, jealousy, and enough sexual tension to light the pages on fire. The unexpected twists along the way made for a surprising ending with just enough of a cliffhanger to leave you satisfied, but anxious for the next installment.Carol Van Atta is sure to become a favorite if her future Werewolves of the West are even half as good as I Kissed A Dog!**Reviewed by Rhonda Valverde for VampireRomanceBooks.com**

$REVIEW.: This book was so poorly written I can't get over it.  Not only was the style like that of a teenage girl, there were typos throughout.  From mistakes in plural nouns and possessive nouns on nearly every page, to the wrong word used in many phrases "adrenaline cursing through her veins" instead of coursing.  Really? I have no idea how this was ever published. The mistakes were distracting but maybe that was good because the writing itself was terrible.  It was at adolescent in style and I'm a girl who likes a cheesy mystery romance. This was well beyond cheesy. There was no mystery. And the writing was choppy and made every character seem not only unbelievable but like they lack intelligence.

$REVIEW.: This book by Moody was a very unusual read in its own way. It covered the doctors office in which there are two doctors and three supporting personnel along with spouses of the doctors, former and past. It covers their relationships with each other and what happens in the office as the relationships between the participants change. Though it does not go too far in completing the story it speaks through the voices of the various participants which was interesting. I enjoyed it.J.

$REVIEW.: What do you know about James Garfield? That was the twentieth President of the United States, and that he was the second president to be assassinated
When lists are drawn up, ranking the presidents, Garfield either is unlisted for accomplishing too little, or appears towards the bottom of the list

But, what is there to know about President Garfield? Well, it turns out quite a lot!In this fascinating book, author Candice Millard, tells us all about the man that James Garfield was, about who his assassin was, and about the state of medicine at the time, which probably did more to cause the Garfield's death than the assassin's gun did!It is a very good book
I must admit that I never did know much about Garfield, and I found him to be a very interesting man
It's no wonder that he won the race for the presidency

I also was quite fascinated by the author's view of America in the 1880s, including Alexander Graham Bell and his invention

It really is a surprisingly interesting book, and I highly recommend it.

$REVIEW.: This is a hit or miss book in my opiniondont get me wrong its good.I have read almost all of the books discussed in this book and was well familiar with the books and particular  subjects  that were the topics of the interviews.Some interviews are very insightful some are rather lackluster as well as the questions asked lacked depth, but other times it really shines

why i say its hit or missFor example the if you read the bard d ehrman interview  which I thought was basically a summery of every book the guy wrote with out the added biographical bits  that ehrman's  books are full of 


It was a pretty concise summery 


To be honest if you dont wan to go through all his books  you could skip ehrman's books and just read this interview it sums it up nicely and gets to the major points right away 

like a cliff notes .I also liked the Jacob fiddler interview someone who gets very little attention but has  grasped some of the most profound spiritual messages of gnosticism.The academic stuff bored me to tears

 The pagels interview was ok i guess, left me feeling " i heard all this before "  The weird part that struck me  at the very end  the interview the questioner  compares her to tolken and she replies " i hope i end up like token" than the interview  end's It's was really bizarre

i don't know what that means first of all and what does that have to do with the subject?  not that theres anything wrong with tolken
 it maybe says more about her  than anything i suppose
 some of the questions like that made me feel annoyed 


 but berger pilsen and marven mayer and bruce chilton interviews are really spot on! answers you wont find anywhere else .so in the end its worth the money

$REVIEW.: This is a captivating little book that reveals how 30 Prisoners Of War (POWs) from Viet Nam have coped with life after their horrible privation and suffering while imprisoned in North Viet Nam. A number of well known POWs, like Senator John McCain and Medal of Honor winner Bud Day, are included. Authors Howren and Kiland have skillfully probed the inner man within each of these heroes, revealing to the reader the unique traits these men possessed that helped them survive their ordeals.  These traits more often than not have stayed within their personas and have helped to mold them in their post-POW lives.  Very professional black and white photographs show these men, often with family members, in contemporary settings and the photos reveal their essential humanity better than the written word ever could.  While their POW experiences were horrific, these men come across thirty years later as not only quite normal, they seem to possess very unique insights into the persons they have become.  Each POW's story is presented in two parts; the first is their thirty years later story, followed by a separate section with photos from before or just after their captivity ended and more comprehensive career histories.  This arrangement gives a "before and after" which clearly shows the contrasts in their lives over time. The last portion of the book includes some excellent analysis of the demographics of POWs and insightful discussion of some myths and facts that help put them in proper context. This is a unique and professionally done book, easy to read and sure to hold the interest of anyone who wondered what became of the POWs of Viet Nam.

$review_text.: I downloaded this book a few weeks ago but have just got around to reading it. When I downloaded it, it had positive reviews(now they are mostly negative!). I also must have missed the part where it informs me it is book one of two.I'm glad I only paid 77p because the storyline was awful. I didn't like any of the characters. Natalie the heroine caught her boyfriend being unfaithful so runs away to Miami to stay with her friend (whose a bit of a slapper!). The first day there, Natalie meets Nolan. He likes her and she decides she will use him to get over her ex but when she gets drunk Nolan refuses to have sex with her (as if!).Nolan wants to date Natalie but she doesn't want a relationship so soon. It doesn't take her long to change her mind even after Nolan informing her that he has been unfaithful within his previous relationships. When they do have sex he checks she is on the pill and then they have unprotected sex. Natalie seems to conveniently forget the problems she had with him being unfaithful!The problem with the storyline is its a bit all over the place. We have Natalie reminiscing about her time with her ex then the next minute her panties are damp (was sick of reading that line) because of Nolan. Nolan and Natalie don't converse much. I was 60% in before she even found out what he was studying at college. Characters are introduced left, right and centre.We are supposed to believe that Natalie and Nolan fall in love (him instantly) but I wasn't feeling it. There is very little emotion. Yes there are some hot sex scenes but they are spoilt when Nolan suddenly decides to start calling Natalie 'Bunny'!!Some parts of the storyline were far fetched. Wherever Natalie is, next minute Nolan just strolls up. Then Natalie's ex turns up in Miami and when we find out why he cheated on her, it didn't ring true for me.I suppose the author has potential. I don't think I will bother with the sequel. At the end of the book it tells us it releases in November but the product description of this book has been updated to say it will be released in May. The book doesn't end on a cliffhanger and they are at a HFN point so I can't see where the author is going to take it with a sequel. God knows why authors are choosing to tell their stories in two or three books. I wish they would stop it. This book could have been told in one book and the story could definitely have done with some editing.

$review_text.: This is an excellent book for anyone interested in WWII, especially the ETO.  There are a couple of nice pluses in this book.First, the story is broader than usual.  There are certainly other good histories of the Battle of Britain, but this is the best treatment I have seen of the lead-up to the battle on the British side.  Specifically, the development of RADAR and the Spitfire.The other nice facet of this book is that the author definitely makes his opinion known, keeping the book from being too dry, but at the same time, he is clear in distinguishng between his opinions and the facts.Once I started this book, I just ripped right through it.

The introduction was written by someone who doesn't really seem to understand the suicidal mindset.  There were a couple pretty interesting chapters, such as the golden gate bridge jumpers, but I'm glad I interlibrary loaned the book rather than buying it.  Many of the notes are very old, like 1900-1920.  One intresting quote which I will paraphrase here says that mentally healthy comfortable people don't want to write and that to want to write is a sign of mental problems.  It really says something about me.  I get excited just seeing a fresh notebook.

$review_text.: If you have read The TNT Diet by Dr. Jeff Volek and Adam Campbell and wished there was a female version of that book, then this is it! In fact, the author Cassandra Forsythe works with Dr. Volek, a world-renowned low-carb diet researcher from The University of Connecticut, and has her name appearing on many of the latest low-carb research studies over the past few years. She believes in low-carb nutrition and was asked by Women's Health magazine to write a book about weight loss and fitness. Some have been critical of this book because they claim it focuses too much on low-fat and not enough on low-carb. But I think it does a good job of having people avoid the culprit carbs that pack on the pounds which is most important when you are looking for a diet plan that will actually work. The "secret weapon" behind this program is the glucomannan fiber that you sprinkle on your foods to make you fuller faster, take away your hunger, and to slow down the absorption of the food into your body. Again, critics say this is gimmicky, but it could be just what is needed to help someone struggling with their weight to get their body into shape. Forsythe is an avid weight trainer and provides specific exercises for women to get that "perfect body" they desire.

$REVIEW.: Wedding bells were ringing and soon &#8220;a rectangle and a rhombus fell in love&#8221; and were married.  They were all excited when they learned they were going to have a baby, but were wondering what it would look like.  Perhaps the baby would look like Mother Rhombus and &#8220;have four equal sides.&#8221;  But then again, it just might look like Father Rectangle and would &#8220;have four right angles.&#8221;  They were all excited and could hardly wait until their baby arrived.  It was a big surprise when they got to the hospital and found out that that big surprise was not one, but three babies!  There was something very unusual about one of them though.Rhombus Jr. looked exactly like her mother and Rectangle Jr. looked like his father.  The third baby was, well ... rather different and they didn&#8217;t know quite what to name their third beautiful baby.  She looked like both of her parents with &#8220;four right angles and four equal sides.&#8221;  It was a puzzling situation and they decided to consult the family.  Cousin Triangle thought they could name her Polygon while Cousin Trapezoid thought Parallelogram was as good a name as any.  All kinds of names were suggested including Quadrangle, Quadrilateral, Rectombus, and even Rhombangle.  None of them seemed quite right, but someone had to know what to name that baby!This is a fun tale that will help young students learn about geometric shapes.  The tale of the Shape family will help them learn not only the names, but also what they are comprised of.  For example, when Aunt Hexagon talks about naming the baby, she says that &#8220;She has four angles.  We could name her Quadrangle.&#8221;  Like all the other characters in this book, her body is shaped like the shape she&#8217;s describing.  Some of them have background illustrations showing a visual mathematical representation.  The artwork is simple, thus bringing the shapes to the foreground.  There are four pages of activities in the back of the book. Additional complementary activities can be accessed on the publisher&#8217;s website.Grades K - 3This book courtesy of the publisher.

$REVIEW.: You Are How You Move:  Experiential Chi Gung by Ged Sumner is a practical guide that serves well as a basic introduction to qigong.  It does not go deeply into the history of the practice, nor does it delve too far into the philosophy of qigong overall. What the book lacks in depth, it makes up for in practicality.Full of photographs and suggested exercises, the beginner can easily try qigong without feeling overwhelmed with too much information.  For the most part, I found the descriptions of the exercises easy to follow, well complimented for the most part by the photographs. For one practice I found confusing I was able to find a video on youtube that explained the exercise visually.  The Sea Form exercise was a bit confusing because the description and photograph did not agree but I think the photograph is more accurate because, based on the image one would get of a wave being made with the hands, the photo simply makes more sense.  All in all, there was only one form/exercise I could not find on youtube and/or figure out using the description and photographs.In other words, for once I am not whining about how nice it would be if the author and/or publisher would provide a dvd to help the reader to do the exercises.  Even the meditation practices are short enough to be read, the book set aside, and then the meditation done without referring again to the text.I'm going to hold onto this book for a little while.  I want to play with the exercises a bit, see how the practices can complement what I am already doing with my qigong and Reiki.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll decide to keep it permanently.

$review_text.: Oh My! I enjoyed this setup of the story and intro of the characters.Fire Rising features nonstop action, thrilling suspense, danger, well-drawn characters and DRAGONS!!!!!Sammi has been betrayed by her ex-lover and partner. He was laundering money for the mob and using her pub as the front for his illegal activities. He's no longer in the picture and neither is her pub, literally blown up by the mob. On the run, injured and without a safety net, she seeks her half-sister hoping for a day or two to rest. I could have shaken Sammi. She was so afraid of putting her sister and her family in harm's way that she left them unaware as to what foes she and they were facing. Tristan was incredible. He was protective and powerful but his visions were revealing and confusing. Since this was just the 1st installment, I expect much more from these two soon!The story kept me guessing right up past the end... LOL! There really wasn't an end since this is the 1st part of a serialized book. I had totally forgotten that when I started reading, but I'm hooked now and must read the future installments.This was a VERY Good start and I'm looking forward to reading more!

all submitted for an exhibit to be held sometime in the future
Lots of great illustration, very contemporary - but I wish the subject matter and treatments could have shown more variety
I think everyone invited to participate is a working artist of a certain age group - thus the homogeneity of the project


Nice though.

$REVIEW.: This Gluten-free Bread for Beginners recipe book has some great recipes in it


I have other recipe books due to my son's wheat allergies but these had some unique twists for many different types of bread


Not only are there recipes for your standard sandwich bread and french baguettes, there are also recipes for seeded honey bread and apple parsnip bread, which is amazing with ham and cheese on it while it is still warm
Also, included in this book is a section called &#8220;15 Strategies for Better Bread&#8221; that explains the difference for breads with nut flours or regular wheat flours

This is a great book for a gluten-free amateur baker or a novice baker!

Family feuds, ritual harassment of siblings and steaming hot meatballs are all a part of daily life, but when her grandmother passes to the next world, the contents of her last will and testament tip the family balance way over the edge.Now financially independent for the first time in her life, Marie decides to make every moment count, dumping her unfaithful lover Jessica, buying a house in LA, and deciding to become a successful writer of screenplays.  Not one to suffer mediocrity, Marie spends ages agonizing over the perfect actress for her perfect screenplay, finally deciding on actress Lorn Elaine.

$REVIEW.: (Cross-posted from Adarna SF book blog)Ghosts of Rosewood Asylum is a paranormal suspense/contemporary fantasy novel with a fun and original premise. It's about a reality show that investigates paranormal activity, and the investigators are students from the Catholic Saint Xavier University in Chicago. Zach is a pretty ordinary guy working on his PhD in Psychology... other than the fact that he's worried about network ratings, he's possessed by the spirit of his dead uncle, and the abandoned asylum he's investigating has something in it that's keen on setting him and his team ablaze.The prologue was okay, but it was chapter one that won me over. I was instantly charmed by Zach, and the story moves quickly into the world of supernatural investigations, TV production politics, and the creepy grounds of Rosewood Asylum.I truly enjoyed the TV production aspect to this book-it's interesting how it structures the investigation and the interactions between the characters. There are several scenes where the characters would have the real interaction (greeting each other or relaying information), then they'd have to do it all over again and adjust their dialogue for the camera. It was enlightening and it cracked me up. The rivalry between the two paranormal groups is amusing ("the Demon Hunters looked like a pack of Hells Angels who'd ridden their motorcycles through the entire length of a circus train") and a lot of scheming takes place. Other than having an evil spirit/arsonist on the premises, they also have casting/promotion politics and planted evidence to deal with.An abandoned insane asylum isn't the most original location for a paranormal investigation, but Prosapio brings such a convincing history to the setting that I wouldn't be surprised if it was a real place. The causes of the asylum's haunted fate are tied to real events in Chicago, adding a richness to the world-building.While the characters, setting, and subplots are great, the central paranormal plot is a bit predictable. There were key points that I saw coming from a mile away. A character was introduced early in the book, and I wrote a comment on my Kindle: "It's gonna be revealed eventually that this person is dead all along Sixth Sense-style". Yep-it happened. And I suppose exorcism-style books could only really end in one way, especially if the author is working on a sequel. Maybe I'm just not as attuned with this genre, but I wish that the author would subvert paranormal tropes a bit more.Also, some lines came off a bit weird at first. In a scene where Zach and a psychic consultant exchange movie lines as they greet each other, the narration explains that these lines are significant because the consultant resembles the lead of the film and "it also mocked the stereotype that black people, at least those not practicing Voodoo in New Orleans, weren't psychic and never dabbled in the occult." I was confused by that comment until later on, I realized that consultant was African-American himself, and this is a book where the protagonist is a white Catholic boy possessed by the spirit of his dead uncle. I guess it wasn't immediately clear to me that this was part of the fantasy world-building.The central plot could've had more surprises, but it's still fun novel overall and the other story elements make it a refreshing read. Ghosts of Rosewood Asylum is a well-written book and it's recommended if you're into the paranormal genre. Give the sample a try-I'd be surprised if chapter one didn't suck you in instantly.Note: A free review copy was provided by the author.

Not only in my personal life, but at work as well.  Since I was too embarrassed to admit this to anyone, I decided to check out Amazon for books on this subject that might help me.  The Shyness Cure was exactly what I needed.  The author provides tremendous insight, as well as practical advice and solutions for dealing with, and overcoming shyness.  I found the advice practical and easy to follow, and I also have a better understanding of why I developed shyness in the first place.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with this issue!  5 stars all the way!

$review_text.: I am convinced that there simply cannot be a biography of some one like Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, which would be universally recognized as balanced and objective. The attempt in this book is by Said Aburish, a Christian Lebanese journalist based in London and who holds an American passport. Although the author feels his background qualifies him better than non-Arab writers to write such a book, I well anticipate that some, if not many, readers may see Aburish's backgound alone as enhancing or diminishing his credibility in writing a biography of a controversial personality who has been at the center of a bitterly divisive conflict in the Middle East.And much as the author strives to a journalistic book, full of information which he presents as factual, his tone is hardly non-partisan and one can hardly describe his portrait of Arafat as flattering. From the beginning, Aburish asserts QUOTE without doubt UNQUOTE that Arafat's birthplace, long shrouded in mystery, is Cairo, and that, notwithstanding the time he spent among Palestinians, Arafat still speaks Arabic like an Egyptian, to the point where QUOTE West Bankers did not like his Egyptian accent and ways and found them alien.UNQUOTE The book is full of other anecdotes of Arafat's personal life, including his uneasy relationship with a father whose funeral he did not attend.These journalistic anecdotes belie the character of the book which is fundamentally a political commentary on the Middle East conflict. Aburish gives credit to Arafat for three strategic choices: fostering a Palestinian identity to counter Israel rather than relying on Arag governments to do the bidding for the Palestinians; choosing armed struggle which earned the Palestinians world recogntiion; and, later, pursuing (or attempting to pursue, perhaps) a peaceful settlement with Israel. But Aburish is also categorical in his judgment that Araft is unfit to serve as a modern leader of Palestinians, comparing him to QUOTE an uneducated wily Arab chief UNQUOTE and holding him responsible for dictatorial ways which he says has supressed the Palestinian people and created a corrupt entity in the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Not surprisingly, Aburish volunteers a proposed replacement for Arafat in the triumvarate of three well-known Palestinians who have been know as able negotiators in Washington.With a proper filter to sort fact from opinion and a framework for contextualizing this book, a careful reader can find value in Aburish's otherwise well written biography.

$REVIEW.: 3.75 starsTEMPTING THE COWBOY is the first storyline in Elizabeth Otto's new Paint River Ranch contemporary adult series focusing on the Haywood Brothers and the women they love. This is Cole and Rylan's story-a story of forbidden love and second chances.The storyline follows Rylan as she begins working at the Haywood family ranch as a housekeeper and assistant for the Haywood matriarch who is having some difficulties caring for the household duties, feeding the ranch hands and looking after her granddaughter on a daily basis. Rylan is a strong female presence but one that is scarred down to her very soul. But Rylan has a few secrets and one in particular that will tear at her heart every time she looks at Cole's four year old daughter Birdy.Cole is a single father and works hard keeping the ranch profitable. But Cole made a mistake years before and he has made a promise to himself as well as his brothers that he would never put himself in that position again. But something about Rylan calls to Cole's inner soul and the sparks fly from the moment they met. As difficult as it is to be in the same room with Rylan, it is more difficult to be separated for any length of time.The relationship between Rylan and Cole begins under dubious circumstances when Rylan discovers that the drunken cowboy at the local bar is her new boss and owner at Haywood Ranch. Their subsequent encounters mask a building sexual attraction between each other and one that is not missed by Cole's brother and ailing mother. Both Rylan and Cole must overcome painful pasts that continue to affect their current situations and until one or both is able to forgive and forget, our couple are caught in a never ending loop of heartbreak and failure.The secondary characters are colorful but play only minor roles in this particular instalment. We are introduced to Cole's brother Tucker and there is mention of a brother who is serving in Afghanistan at the time.Elizabeth Otto pulls the reader into a storyline of forbidden love and a second chance at love. Cole is a man who has been burned by his past and Rylan is a woman whose life was sent spiraling out of control by a loss so devastating that she does not know if she will ever recover.Tempting the Cowboy is a wonderful story about struggling to move forward when all you want to do is runaway and hide. Elizabeth Otto has written a sweet storyline of second chances and letting go; loss and recovery; friendship and love. If you like a romantic storyline with a happily ever after, Tempting the Cowboy is the perfect Sunday afternoon read.Copy supplied by the author.

$REVIEW.: Daughter of Mythos starts out with Nora once again being asked to leave a foster home.  Her foster parents never believe that she&#8217;s not destroying things.  I wanted to cry at how alone Nora seemed to be.  All she wanted was a family to call her own.  I would have liked to have gotten a little more background on what happened to her adoptive parents and how she ended up in foster care.  Nora finally starts to feel comfortable in her new foster home with Josie and Kasen, when everything changes.  It all starts to change when a new boy starts at her school, Zane.  All of a sudden, she&#8217;s thrust into a world where everything she thought of as myth isn&#8217;t.  I found this to be a very sudden occurrence with little explanation.  Suddenly she&#8217;s on the run from mythical creatures that want her dead to keep the portals between the worlds from closing.  Nora finds out she&#8217;s the Daughter of Mythos and she can close the portals to keep demons from infiltrating Earth.  I really did enjoy the fast pace this book offered.  It was action packed from the beginning and definitely kept my attention.  I loved how Josie and Kasen took Nora in and seemed to love her from the start.  I didn&#8217;t want to like Zane.  He was very standoffish and had the attitude of being better than Nora.  I was confused by his age because of the long lifespan of portal guards.  I did come to love him by the end of the book.  There were definitely some twists and turns that kept me on my toes.  Overall, I really enjoyed this story and would love to read more of Nora&#8217;s adventures.

$REVIEW.: Chilled is the second book in Kendra Elliot's Bone Secrets series and in my opinion it was even better than the first!Brynn Nealey is a forensic nurse who works with a team to perform dangerus search & rescue missions in the Cascade Mountains. Following the news of a plane crash the team prepares to set out to look for survivors, unfortunately the weather is against them. Alex Kinston is a former US Marsal that lies his way onto the team, he knows exactly who was on that plane and he wants to make sure that one of the passengers does not survive. The journey into the blizzard brings more dangers to light than expected, the team must face their own fears and overcome them if they hope to survive. Finding the crash site turns out to be the easy part, what they find when they get there could change all their lives forever.This book takes place over a few short days in freezing temperatures, more than one team member has secrets and we do not uncover them all in this trip. I hope to see some of the characters in future novels so we can get to know them a little better. Brynn was a likeable heroine, her need to help others stems from an accident in her childhood that saw her lose her best friend. Alex's backstory was the one that kept me reading, his need to find the man that did him wrong and see justice being served has influenced his life and decisions for so long, I found myself willing him to get justice so he could get the closure he needs.The story that followed brought lots of tension and once it got started there was lots of drama. I thorughly enjoyed it and can't wait for Buried!

$review_text.: Robert Venditti spins another awesome tale of the time displaced Visigoth, Aric of Dacia. Containing the story from issues 9-14 (that's 6 issues worth for $11 people, less than 2 dollars per issue cost- BUY THIS BOOK!), volume 3 deals with Aric's continuing fight against the Vine. Starting in the skies of Earth and going all the way to the Vine's home planet, this battle for revenge rages on in ways that surprised me when I read them. The art is great most of the time (especially in the flashback history lesson which tells us the origin of the Manowar armor Shanhara itself!) and just okay in a few spots, but the writing is wonderfully complex and deep. I especially love that the Vine aren't just a race of one dimensional cookie cutter bad guys who are all born generically evil. Different individuals have different mindsets and different motivations.Not to mention the motivations and mindset of the 'hero' of the book. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but where this book leaves off sets the stage for another great story to come where Aric might only be a hero in his own mind. If you're not reading any Valiant comics, this book should be proof enough of why you should start. So much good stuff here still carrying over from the seeds that were sown back in issue #1 of the series. The payoff of this whole story is here, and it is a powerful one and well worth reading and owning. I hope you enjoy this story and all the other great Valiant books as much as I have so far!

$REVIEW.: I haven't been reading the Hero Series in order, so I've only seen Josh Elliott being flirty and outrageous and sort of flighty in Cops; Top Men; Two In Two Out. He IS Josh, so he's all of that here, too. But we also find out that he's intelligent, motivated, athletic, mature and wants a better life for himself than a boring office job looking at his cheating ex-BF all day. He's apparently a natural lifeguard and his mentor (straight) Tanner is impressed enough with his skills to arrange having Josh permanently assigned to his tower. Oh, AND he thinks Josh is kind of adorable, even though he's OF COURSE not interested in him 'that way.'  Josh has other ideas, though, and my only real issue with the story is his instant behavior with Tanner. I can't imagine anyone who seriously wanted to be a full-time lifeguard would rub up against his boss like a cat and make suggestive remarks all the time from the get-go. He's pretty lucky that Tanner is not only tolerant, but not as straight as he thought he was. That aside, it's a fun read. The "Josh." "Tanner." bits are cute and made me giggle every time, and I enjoyed finding out that (at least in one story) Josh has more depth than I have been giving him credit for.A quibble that I've had with all of Hauser's books: The editing is sub-par, especially for an author as successful as she is. Grammar and spelling are uneven. I almost suspect the books are edited by spellcheck - just because a word is an actual word doesn't mean it's the correct word. For example:1. "Yeah." Tanner past him, entering the hut... and 'A long moment past where nothing was said but everything was implied.' (should be 'passed' in both cases; this happens a lot in her books)2. Josh had a terribly feeling... (obviously should be 'terrible')3. "So?" Destiny folded her arms over her chest. "Your gay?" (should be 'you're gay?' this happens a lot, too)The last two examples were within a few pages of each other at the end.
$SUMMARY.: Josh has brains!

$REVIEW.: Occupy Wall Street demonstrations and talk around the water cooler, bar or coffee shop are much about fear now.People are afraid. The problem with fear is it is not actionable. There is nothing you can do with. To harness it requires thought and energy that most people simply do not have since the fear itself saps energy and creativity.It is a mature person who can sit back and formulate a plan for positively harnessing fear. For me, the first step would be to manage the stress that fear causes.I read a good book on fear in companies - Breaking the Fear Barrier - How Fear Destroys Companies from the Inside Out and What To Do About It by Tom Rieger. Not sure I like such a negative title.It talks about the causes and damage that fear cause and what to do about it.According to Rieger fear stems from bureaucracy:Parochialism - The tendency to force others to view the world from only one view.Territorialism - Hoarding and micromanaging. In short, not being a team player.Empire Building - which is self evident.And fear can be overcome by overcoming those 3 factors and:Building Courage Enablers (and making sure there are not courage stoppers)It then goes on to talk about the Leadership Imperative and the Fearless Company.One great point he makes is "since fear is created internally, it can be extinguished internally".I like to have a company that has a high tolerance for failure. I always say "fail often, fail fast, fail cheap". Companies that embrace this as a method for innovation and growth need to have people who are not living in fear.

$REVIEW.: I picked up The Stone Forest because I like romantic suspense and it looked interesting. It took me about two years to finally read it, and that should have been a red flag. I read a lot of books, and it can take me a while to get to a book. I like to finish anything I've started and try to give books the benefit of the doubt. I've read some pretty bad books and managed to finish them (The Wish Club by Stella Cameron is one - I could not believe that anyone would actually publish it with all the plot holes and cliched writing) However, I just could not get into The Stone Forrest. I made it as far as chapter five before I just peeked at the end to see whodunit. It was not at all surprising. The characters were just flat and did nothing to raise  my interest in what happened to them. And the plot bored me. Seriously. I just did not care, and nothing the author did made any difference.Don't bother with this one is my advice.

$review_text.: Claude Thomas's At Hell's Gate is the story of a terribly wounded individual (bad childhood, PTSD, alcohol and drug addictions, intimacy problems) trying to find healing for himself.  His analysis of his own ill-being, to use a phrase favored by Thomas' mentor, Thich Nhat Hanh, is not only a gripping story.  It's also valuable to the rest of us who, like Thomas, are likewise wounded.Thomas' journey to healing is based on Nhat Hanh's "engaged Buddhism" model.  The basic principles of engaged Buddhism are that (1) violence is caused by suffering; (2) suffering is caused by unacknowledged and unhealed interior wounds whose destructive energy manipulates us;  (3) mindfulness to those wounds and the way they enslave us is essential to both personal and social liberation from violence; (4) reality is best described in terms of "interbeing," unbreakable connectedness, so that my actions or lack of actions necessarily affect everything; (5) and therefore my own healing contributes to the healing of the world.Thomas' own breakthrough was attending a weeklong retreat conducted by Nhat Hanh.  Since then, Thomas has been ordained a mendicant monk in the Soto Zen tradition, makes regular walking peace pilgrimages across the U.S. and other parts of the world, and regularly ministers to street people and veterans.This book is well worth reading, especially for someone who has no acquaintance with Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings.  The book is sometimes repetitious, although I can't quite figure out if this is deliberate of unintentional on Thomas' part.  Moreover, one occasionally senses that Thomas' is still so wrestling with his own demons that his focus is more self- than other-directed.Still, these are minor caveats, and Thomas' book stands as an eloquent and insightful testament to the deep human yearning for a return to innocence, to healing, to wholeness.  As a Zen koan asks, "What did your face look like before you were born?"  At the least, it was without wounds.

$REVIEW.: First off I do not normally like futuristic books but I was asked to try something out of my comfort zone.  This book was awesome!This takes place in Earth 2070. Humans and Aliens do not get along. Betsy was charged with a crime that she didn't commit but her father let her be sold as a slave on a totally different planet!Betsy is a very fiesty and used to the ways on Earth. Being sold into slavery and to have to call someone Master and do as told without talking back or taking any kind of action that would be considered bad coming from a slave. So she has a little bit of a problem learning her place.Her Master is Edek. She was bought as a present by his older brother. Edek HATES humans and is not pleased with the gift. He is a KALL Commander and takes that very seriously. He needs his slave to obey him to the letter or actions will be taken.The relationship between Edek and Betsy had me laughing from the beginning. Both trying to get to know each other but not in the normal way at first. But Edek and Betsy both learn just because you are from different planets doesn't mean things can't change and turn for the better.  The sex scenes are so hot. A little spanking all in the right places makes for some very HOT SEX!!This author is very talented and has my attention with her books! Her characters are lovable and have such a way with each other that makes me feel like I know them. I can't wait to read more from this author.
$SUMMARY.: A Very Sexy HOT read!

$review_text.: I first read these stories in the on-line version of Grantville Gazette. I loved them then, and I love them now. Being a dilettante musician and a reader of police procedural mysteries, these stories are just great. The characterization and plot development all proceed at a goodly pace, and there is only a small letdown in the epistolary story of the courtship of Amber Higham by Heinrich Schutz.The only improvement to this collection as far as I am concerned, would be the addition of a discography for those, who like me, are not that familiar with Irish folk music, or for those who are not that familiar with classical music. That would be a great addition to what are fantastic stories of the effect of 20th century music on the 17th century. It also shows the problems involved in creating a modern police force where none has even been heard of before. The mysteries are also mysterious.

although 'a radical approach to spiritual evolution' is possibly not how I would describe it

I only picked it because it was free [I like 'free'] and it sounded like it could be interesting

$review_text.: It had some issues with spelling and grammar. Some of it was so glaring that it jarred me from the story. Clean that up and it's a 5 star book.The story itself is hard at the beginning and the beginning is going to bother a lot of people because it's graphic. But after that it gets into a more typical story. The thing I like about this book is that there is a degree of real human response in here or at least real for my world. I mean in my reality women have the vast potential to be catty and jealous people lashing out at each other. There's not a whole lot of that girl power we're in this together stuff in my life or in this book.I like that this book didn't go right into a love story. That there was some substantial time lapse in there because after what happened to her I think that's a little more realistic response. I'm so over these books where it's like horrible thing happens and weeks later it's madly in love. While their love moved a little fast for me when it happened I really thought it was better plotted out than most books. I also like that she made some choices in there that were not popular and even as a reader were hard to understand.I didn't like the dual point of view in this book. I know it's all the rage but I hate this trend almost as much as I hate the series trend. And this book is also part of a series. Between those two facts I almost took it down another star. I left it at a 4 star review because even though this is part of a series it can be read as a one shot book. You get pretty much most all of a story in here for it to be a satisfying ending. No doubt the next book will carry some of this on more but you're not left feelign like you're missing anything huge. Also I liked that this is an actual book length book. Not one of these $3 20 page chapters that seems to be all the rage too. You get a whole story with fleshed out characters and such. They also aren't having constant sex. So it's not like you're paging through 100's of pages of another redundant sex scene in this book.

$review_text.: I don't know how I feel about the unusual style in which this book was written. At times I wanted to scream. At times I felt that nothing was happening. But overall? It's a 'descent into madness' book that's as fascinating as watching a collision. The main character is planning to do something most of us would find heinous- but she's not doing it for sadistic or uncaring reasons.  As she tries to explain her choices, she reveals herself as a character you won't soon forget. If you have a compulsive need for happy endings, all neatly tied up, then this isn't your book. If you can tolerate some ambiguity and sorrow for the sake of meeting a fascinating character, go for it.

$review_text.: I really needed this book. I didn't realize that all of the books that I have been reading this year so far up until this point haven't been that awesome compared to this book. I seriously am kicking myself in the butt for waiting so long to read it. I should have read it when it came out in January. I really can not believe how Beth Revis could create and write a book so spectacular in Across the Universe and then go back and make a sequel that tops that. Beth Revis is such a spectacular author. She weaves a story with her writing that is so detailed, unexpected and thrilling. I can not explain to you how amazing this book was. It completely skyrocketed and went beyond all of my expectations for it. I mean right from the beginning I was thrust into an awesome adventure and journey of a roller coaster ride that I had no clue which direction it would take me in. I had to of audibly gasped at least a million times throughout this whole book, that is literally how many twists and turns A Million Suns has.Godspeed has many more lies and cover ups then even I was expecting. I thought everything was settled in the first book but I was totally wrong and wasn't expecting anything that happens. A Million Suns blew my mind. I didn't think this book series could get any more better and it has. The mystery and intrigue of the first book grows even more. The story is built on top of one lie after another and you would never expect the direction that this book has ended up in. My mind was literally turned upside down on its head from how awesome this book was. I can't say it enough.I really loved all of the new characters that were introduced and the things that happen to them are astounding. You also get to learn more about other background characters that were introduced earlier. The intrigue and mystery is what really made me dive head first into this sequel. It kept up the pace and didn't disappoint at all.If you haven't read this series it is seriously incredible and needs to be read. So far this is my favorite book of 2012. Every single time I wasn't reading this book I was thinking about it and was wishing that I was reading it. I read this book so fast I wanted to slow myself down so I could make the amazing experience last longer. The mystery is hyped up even more on Godspeed and it leads to chaos throughout the entire ship with Elder's leadership coming into question. Amy has a big choice to make and you will have to read the book to find out what that choice is. The whole ship is like a microcosm of Earth and gets thrown into disorder and has no clue what is in store for them.A Million Suns ends in such an exciting adventurous way which impacts everyone on the ship. I can not wait to see how the journey continues and what happens to everyone on board the ship. I can't wait to see how Amy and Elder's relationship progresses some more and what is in store for the both of them. January 2013 can not come fast enough, I want to read Shades of Earth right now.

We see so much character introducing (seriously I could barely get past the first chapter) and a lot of flashbacks from the past but nothing in the future. They've been apart for ten years. That's a huge gap and people change so much in that amount of time. It seemed like it was too quick too. They just kiss and make up essentially, that's not enough to really establish a relationship.

It is indeed wordy, much longer than it needs to be, and is definitely trading on Evita's name.  Nevertheless, it is worth reading.  It just might have you researching Google to get more of the true story.

Billy " The Kid" Blake is a Hostile Operation Team soldier-and Olivia's former lover.Billy never forgot the woman who walked on him, and he'll do anything he can to keep her safe. But as time runs out and the snow piles up, can Billy and Olivia work together without getting involved again?"Two days before Christmas...She found herself in big trouble..Last year she was wrapped up in Billy's arms..That was the Christmas in a long time where she'd been happy and filled with thought of her future. She pushed away those memories and was thinking of her troubles, BIG troubles.. She need Billy and badly..She had gotten a CD from Alan Cooper, head of development, and she still couldn't figure out he'd sent her such a thing. Unless he hadn't meant to.But it had been in a holey Joe envelope in her inbox, clearly marked for her. "She had wanted Billy the kid to give up his life as HOT and he went on the last mission so she left. What she didnt know was he was prepared to do just that. oh well.. But now she needed his help.. As she drove up his drive she slid off the road in the snow. Billy coming home, notice the car slid off the road by the shiny metal, he was surprised. Long story short, she was surprised when he agreed to help her uncover the mystery of the pkg that was left for her and what it all meant. He called in favors from his HOT teammates and all. Her respect for him grew and she had new found respect for Billy and his HOT job. But is it enough for for the love they have for one another. I loved this new found author and will be reading more of of HOT books and any for that matter. KUDOS!

 The character, Laura Cardinal seems real and you feel for her in Book 3 as she tries to get her professional and romantic life in order


 She's smart and all too human.Ms


Black's storylines are intricate and complex
 Many suspects to follow up, just as you'd imagine would happen in a real case


 A lot of hard work and blind alleys before you strike it lucky and catch the bad guy.I really like this author's compelling stories which have the right amount of tension, highs and lows and finely detailed characters

 A well-told tale with limited swearing & sex and not too graphic violence hits the sweet spot for me
 Will be looking for more of Laura Cardinal.

$REVIEW.: Path of NeedlesPaths Book OneBy Hannah KollefSeventeen year old Kat Finnegan is not your average teenager, she has grown up in a world full of art and culture in New York, goes to a private school, and has a twin brother. If this was not enough to make her interesting her father soon goes missing and she is pulled into a world that she always thought of as a Fairy Tale.This novel is a young adult urban fantasy, whew what a mouthful, and is so much fun to read. Hannah Kollef has taken a classic tale in its original form and weaved a magnificent story in a modern setting. To further capture your attention in this novel and to guarantee you will continue on with the story the twin brother and sister are called "The Truth" and "The Lie" in the fey kingdom and their coming is referred to as the "Lost Prophecy" this is just the beginning of the story! I loved the characters and not only does Hannah Kollef suck you in with the main story she also fills the story full of emotional side stories that certainly keep you entertained as you go along, such as the sense of loss you feel over Kat's father going missing. This is worth the read and I cannot wait for the next book to come out!I was sent a free copy of this novel for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: Written with incredible detail, this spellbinding musical drama at the New York Metropolitan Opera House mimics the operatic masterpieces performed by some of the greatest musicians to ever grace the stage.  As a murder mystery unfolds amongst members of the orchestra, Julia, a young violinist, finds herself in the midst of the investigation.  Determined to find the killer, Julia encounters a unique and colorful cast of characters who shed light into the eccentric life of those in the arts. This delightful story adds rich layers of culture and intrigue to a brilliantly twisted plot that's guaranteed to thrill the lovers of a great mystery.I was provided a copy of the book by BTS eMag for purpose of honest review.

$REVIEW.: Jaymee Ballard grew up with an abusive father and a mother too scared to stand up for her. When she was sixteen, she became pregnant and was forced by her parents to give the baby girl Sarah up for adoption. Now Jaymee is on her own, struggling financially but trying to track down her daughter. She enlists the help of her friend Lana and they start investigating a seemingly illegal adoption ring when Lana is brutally murdered. Four years later another woman with knowledge of the search for Jaymee's daughter is killed in a similar fashion. Lana's husband Nick and Jaymee team up to solve the mystery when they realize the killings are connected.This was a suspenseful read filled with interesting characters that were well developed. I felt sympathy for Jaymee due to all she went through and the cruel way her family treated her. I totally understood her feelings for wanting to find her daughter. The killer's identity was surprising to me. I thought I had it figured out, but I was wrong and shocked to find out who it really was. At first I really didn't care for the cover and wondered what Tin God had to do with the story, but it is eventually explained and makes perfect sense. So the title is very fitting for the story and the character it represents. A little romance, a little mystery, and a few evil characters make for a quick and satisfying read.

$review_text.: For most people, "Daniel" isn't associated with prophecy, but with lions (as in a den of lions).  That familiar Bible story is here, along with the many prophecies--history literally written in advance--that Daniel recorded during the Jewish exile in the city of Babylon.  This is a good book for the serious Bible student, and note that the paragraphs in each chapter have questions, indicating that this isn't relaxing reading material but rather Bible study.  My only qualm is that this book, like many others here on Amazon, doesn't have to be bought from Amazon; it's free to the public from Jehovah's Witnesses.

I had someone leave me too for not real reason, but we found our way back just like Charley and Jake did, but the emotions are just are as raw. Samantha did a wonderful job explaining how each character felt and what they went through in each of their perspectives.  Jake had witnessed a horrible thing that will be with him for life, but he is getting through it, and with Charley's help it will get better in time.  I loved this book, I couldn't put it down!

$review_text.: Wow! My literature professors always said that a novel is praiseworthy if it inspires in the reader strong emotions, and  Neil Ostroff's Drop Out certainly does that


I was, in turn, scared, horrified, revolted, depressed and warmed by this graphically depicted novel of disaster, tragedy, death and rebirth
Drop Out opens with haunting, pictorial scenes from the World Trade Center bombing where our hero barely escapes the horrors of inexpressible gore and death, loses all his friends and family, and is left not only jaded and guilt-ridden but unrecognizably disfigured to resume his lonely life

He subsequently battles  a vividly and realistically portrayed hurricane off the coast of Key West to meet a dying woman, whose innovating love and spirit reminds him that happiness isn't only for the beautiful or carefree, and ultimately cures his irremediable depression

In this alarming novel, I confronted fear, revulsion, depression, loneliness, and mortality right along with the hero.Elly MichaelsAuthor: For Love of a CauseB00DX6IV0E

$review_text.: I have read the Bible through several times over the years. This is my first time to read it through with the Everyday With Jesus Bible. The format of having four different parts of the Bible for each day makes it much more interesting than having one huge selection. The Holman Christian Standard translation makes it much easier to understand the Bible. I am enjoying reading through the Bible each day much more than I have in the past. And more importantly, I am getting a lot more out of the Bible. The Selwyn Hughes commentaries at the end of each day are excellent. I can't recommend this Bible highly enough. I am getting a real blessing out of it and I hope you will too.

$REVIEW.: Marina Kelly is the youngest of Mike and Julia's four children. She, like her siblings, find her father to be to strict. Marina even goes so far as to describe him as a male chauvinist and a control freak. This along with being a cop, runs in her family so she refuses to get involved with anyone in law enforcement.Levi Hawks is fifth generation police, his families blood runs blue. The first time he laid eyes on Marina Kelly something in him stirred, which in and of itself was a near miracle since women haven't caught his attention in over a year when he broke up with his longtime girlfriend. When his coworker Frankie Kelly tells him her sister refuses to look twice at cops, he's determined to change her mind.This is a short story which I was able to finish in one afternoon. It didn't dwell too much on the father/child dynamics of the Kelly family, which was nice, after three other books I got the point that the children were not fans of dear old dad. This book is about a strong and independent young woman and that is always a plus for me. Another plus was the hot sex scene, Ms. Collins added more details this time around than were in her other books. I enjoyed this book and look forward to read Where There's Smoke. I give Marina 4 stars and 2 hands down the pants.

The characters, who are wonderfully depicted, lead such incredibly difficult lives


There is 14 year old Esch Batiste, and her father and three brothers all trying to get by living in a small patch of land in bayou county, called the pit
Her father senses a storm is coming and begins to prepare for it way before the word begins to leak in over the radio that a hurricane is brewing in the Gulf of Mexico...Katrina

This novel is about the twelve days leading up to being hit
There is tenderness, greed, rawness and love all patched together to make a memorable and sad impression that lingers long after you close the book.

$review_text.: The first book in this series, Desperate Love, was captivating from the beginning. Following the vampire brothers Demon and Stefan, Hazen begins at the start of season four and writes an alternative version of the show.In this story, Elena is a new vampire who cannot deny her love for bad boy Damon. She chooses him and they quickly find themselves caught up in a war with vampire hunters, some of whom they can trust, others not so much.Dealing with her choice of brothers, Elena and Damon&#8217;s relationship is tested as a witch&#8217;s curse is revealed and threatens to end everything they have worked so desperately for.Over the trilogy, Hazen spins a web of intrigue, lies, trust, and admiration. The emotions are high and the love scenes are hot. Vampires have never been this good before.What I truly loved about this series is how well Hazen embodied the characters. She was absolutely true to the television show, from the dialogue to the history to the minute idiosyncrasies. Not once did she compromise the characters for the story.Even if you don&#8217;t watch The Vampire Diaries, the Desperate Love Trilogy can still be enjoyed. The story is exceptionally written with the most beautiful descriptions and dialogue you could ask for. Definitely a must read, you will not be sorry.
$review_summary.: Beautifully written.

$review_text.: I'm reading Avik Roy's book (pamphlet) on Medicaid. I have some strong opinions on this topic. In 1965, when Medicare and Medicaid became law, I was a medical student at the Los Angeles County Hospital. My experience has been that the big city hospitals that once served as the safety net for the urban poor, were devastated by the new law. Medicaid (MediCal in California) would not pay for care in the County hospital where resident physicians were often the providers. I knew men who quit their residencies to start MediCal mills.Years later, after I had done a graduate program at Dartmouth, I asked permission of the new MediCal administrator to study the results of an HMO model versus a fee for service model. I had the funding and the academic support. Permission was refused.The author does an excellent job of describing the evolution of Medicaid and the effects on the poor. I have never changed my mind about the benefits of the previous model, using big community teaching hospitals to treat the poor. Medicaid promised them "mainstream private care" which they have never had and will not have under Obamacare. Many primary care docs I knew when I was in practice would treat Medicaid patients and never bill the system because the payment was so poor and it took two years to get paid. They were in practice in a prosperous community. Many inner city docs had no choice but were unable to provide good quality care. Medicaid was never a real choice for the poor.Good account and well worth reading. His last section advocates a free market system for the Medicaid population. I tend to doubt its efficacy and think the basic safety net would be stronger in a system that included teaching hospitals and clinics. There is a reason most poor people are poor. For years after Medicaid began we would get patients coming to the County Hospital clinics for a second opinion, then going back to the private second rate hospital because of the amenities. They trusted us but liked the semi-private room.

$REVIEW.: "A Concise Summary of Nate Silver's The Signal and the Noise...in 30 Minutes" is published by Garamond Press and based on the recent book written by political analyst, Nate Silver. The author has made some amazingly successful sport and political predictions and as a result has had much publicized success.Each chapter is broken into three sections.  There is a detailed overview, chapter summary and finally key points that easily explain each concept presented. Each chapter summary also shows a real life example to better illustrate the concept described.  I found the key points area to be extremely helpful at further illustrating the most important ideas.This summary explains the many areas that predictions are used.  They include elections, financial trends, athletic performance, weather, earthquakes, the economy, medical outbreaks, climate change, terrorism and even playing poker.It explains what the author believes is the best method to use when forecasting.  The Bayesian Method is crucial because it includes the important idea of "uncertainty" in the equation. It further explains key mistakes that forecasters have made and continually make because of their biased ways of thinking.After reading this summary, I have a much better understanding of how most current forecasters may be making incorrect predictions that greatly affect our lives and future generations.  This summary is clear and concise.  It easily conveys the concepts from Nate Silver's book.

I was enchanted by the author's writing style, which made it hard to put down. I was in love with the action, suspense, and excitement throughout this phenomenally written and addicting short story.  I must admit that even though I expected the author would leave me hanging, I was not prepared for where she left us hanging. This is an amazing group of short stories that will entice you to want to read more. I highly recommend reading this set of stories and becoming true blue fans of this author's style of writing.

$review_text.: Translation of Love by Alice Montalvo-Tribue was such a sweet romance. It pulled me from my book funk and I am so glad it did. I smiled a lot while reading it.Girl meets boy, girl doesn't know that said boy is a very famous singer, girl finds out and still wants boy, boy falls in love with girl and girl falls in love with boy. What happens next is fun and sweet. There is some angst, but not so much that your nerves start to fray.Victor and Ellie are a really great book couple. They have such a sweet, hot relationship and I couldn't help but root for them.Ellie was a good MC. I have to admit that there where times in the story where she kind of annoyed me but those moments where very brief and I never stopped liking her. I just didn't always like her behavior, how she would respond to different situations. It is very obvious right from the beginning that she is a damaged individual. That something happened in a previous relationship to make her that way. I really liked that she blossomed in her relationship with Victor and that she chose to work through her issues and not run from him.Victor was an extremely likable male lead. A very famous Latin singer, he was hot and rich but he was also sweet, kind and really wonderful with Ellie. I loved how he was with her. He stayed very patient with her throughout the story.There are some very sexy scenes. When Victor and Ellie finally come together, wow, it is HOT.I can't wait for the next book, Desperation in Love.Definitely get this book, it is a very sweet romance and is not to be missed.

Only this perspective grants immunity from cliche.  In bringing these events to the page, nobody else comes close.The reader will comprehend much of why Las Vegas, where I personally grew up, is such a tough town to break in to, why the locals don't trust newcomers, and the dynamics of the power sturcture.

$review_text.: I really enjoyed the first book in this series, Not Quite Dating. Jessie and Jack were great characters but I have to say, I think I just might have liked Dean and Katie in this one a little bit more.Maybe it was their shared past or the already there sparks going into this one that made them so appealing but either way, the chemistry between the two was hot! I loved that they had that shared past. That we not only got their story today, but their story from a few years ago as well. It added more depth to the story that I think the first book was lacking (not that it was really lacking mind you, but you get the idea).Dean will forever be on my swoon worthy list. His southern charm, Texan accent and just the way he treated Katie. Gah! He was pretty darn amazing. To see him with Savannah just about melted my heart.He is everything a good friend, brother, father and husband should be.Katie. You know, I loved Katie too but for different reasons. I really liked watching her grow throughout this story. The big changes and the subtle ones too. She became so much more than a rich spoiled girl (not that she ever really acted that way). I loved the development in her personal life with her mother and other things along the way that really shaped the person she became but the end of the story.I loved watching Jack and Jessie too. I am so glad we still got glimpses of them and Danny and even Gaylord (there needs to be a book for him!!). Monica was as great as ever and with the latest development in her life with BN I am really hoping the next book is hers because she so deserves a happily ever after too. She is one of my favorite side character, both in this story and in the first.And even though I saw the direction this one was headed, this was a beautiful story about letting go of past mistakes (yours and others), forgiving, and finding the strength to move on and to be happy. To grab a hold of what really matters in life and to never let go.

Sometimes there were direct contradictions a few pages apart (Melanie's story especially). It felt like a big confusing hodgepodge in between sex scenes, which incidentally were actually quite hot! And perhaps is the point. Worth it for the sale price of $.99, but would not pay more.

Each story is stand-alone wonderful, but the build up from one to the next is amazing.  I don't know how Mr. Donovan does it, but I hope he keeps doing it for a long time.  I feel like these characters are long time friends of mine!  (They are that well developed and that complex.)It's sort of like real life, stuff just keeps happening to them.  The story as an episode ends, but as life it always leaves the door open for more.  In this "episode", Book 5, there's missing money, a mysterious murderer, and of course, Lilith the mystical witch, and more!  I hate to give away a plot, but trust me, this is a fun and entertaining who-dun-it and much more, all because the story is woven intricately and the characters come alive and walk right into your life.  Keep it up Mr. Donovan---please!

Yet I say that if you read one book this year other than the Bible, read The Harbinger.Jonathan is not a "smiles" and "next year is going to be better than this year" pastor. He is more likely to wake you up rather than cheer you up. He's a Messianic Rabbi who sounds like an Old Testament prophet. Jonathan tells it like it is (or will be) rather than as we want it to be, and the truth is always better than selling beachfront property to those who need to seek higher ground.I give this book 5 stars.*Molly Noble Bull is a published Christian novelist and the author of The Overcomers: Christian Authors Who Conquered Learning Disabilities, a new book from Westbow Press.

$REVIEW.: Faces in the Fire is definitely bizarre, but it's also an engaging story


 Four characters -- an amnesiac truck driver, an e-mail spammer with cancer, a tattoo artist addicted to drugs and a hit man who can kill with the slightest touch -- all encounter a series of numbers (think TV's Lost) which has a different meaning to each of them

 They also have common visions of a catfish in one form or another


 Even though the characters don't know each other, their paths cross in some form.The twist at the ending was different and I thought really worked with the overall theme of the story


 However, some may not like it due to its reference


 If you enjoy bizarre tales and/or are a fan of Lost, I recommend giving this one a try.

$review_text.: As a major fan of Glynn James, I have devoured most of his books already. I am always looking for another great story, and this one does not disappoint! I think his stories are very original and keep me spellbound every time I read another series that he has written. I read a lot of zombie fiction, some are the same old, cookie cutter types, and some, like the arisen series,just blow you away. Add in the fact that he collaborated with Michael Stephen Fuchs and you have a technically sound story. There are just too many authors that don't do their homework, and it makes the story all the more unrealistic. Read this series, you wont be sorry!

Now on to the good stuff  I must say I usually don't like sequels but hands down Charity Rising is amazing.This book made me laugh, cry, and scream, but it also made me feel really good. There at a few surprises that I didn't see coming but it only made the book better. If your a Charity and Levi fan you will be extremely happy and won't be disappointed. I'm a big fan of werewolf love stories and if you are too you need to read this, but read Charity Moon it's first.  5 star for Charity Rising.

$REVIEW.: I bought the original book more than 20 years ago.  It was a nice example of how she and her coven worked together using the principles of "Positive Magic", which is still my all time favorite book explaining witchcraft.  This new edition adds information and wisdom gained from her lifetime of experience.  It is a treasure trove for witches who are ready to advance to the next level of their own transformational journey.  I highly recommend this book!

$review_text.: I caught a bit of her interview on TV, and got the book on my Kindle. I am so sorry for what happened to this young woman, but there must be people who helped her in positive ways. She is always blaming people. Some people probably deserve her anger, but I find it very hard to believe that almost everyone who she ever came in contact with was so horrible to her. Even the friends who helped her through so much, we hear nothing but anger and criticism towards them. She needs so much therapy to help her move forward with her life. I hope she will receive it. As to reading this book, it is very poorly written, and not very well thought through. One can not help but feel bad for her and the situation she lived through, but I think the book could have been written in a more concise and organized way.

$review_text.: Cooper has escaped from a small town, that helped cover up her late husbands physical abuse. Strung out on steroids that made Richard even meaner than normal. He was able to abuse Cooper as he had his brother a Judge, doctors who looked the other way and highway patrol who would return her when she would run. Richard was suppose to have died in a shot out, but no body had ever been found.I absolutely loved Coopers character. She had been through hell and back. She had only been loved my her Mother, who had passed away at a very young age. She was left to be raised by her step father & and later step mother. Who pretty much used her as an unpaid maid. Then abused by her husband. But she never gave up on a better life and prayed to be loved.Enter sexy neighbor Kylar Landon. He is everything Cooper has ever wanted in a man and been told she was never good enough to have. He is tall, good looking, kind, protective and rich. Ky falls head over heels in love with Cooper when she saves him from a rattlesnake and ends up getting but instead. She is just adorable when he is bringing her home from the E.R. And the meds are letting her mouth run free. Loved it.A romance soon blooms between the two but when Cooper sees a man on her back porch Ky convinces her to come stay with him. Soon strange things start happening to Ky's property. And missed opportunity's to tell each other how they feel lead to heartache and despair.My heart was overwhelmed for Cooper, with everything she went through and still more to come. The girl spent a lot of time at the E.R. / clinic. Four trips not counting all the times her husband had broken bones. To call her a survivor would be insulting.Very excited to be starting the second book in the series ...  My Aliyah - Heart in Chains

I devoured it in just a couple of days and was not disappointed. I love the direction the story is taking and the Norse mythology surrounding the fairies added an interesting depth to Jones' fictional world.Captivate is full of action - from page one - and has fantastic plot twists that kept this reader on the edge of her seat. The introduction of fascinating new characters as well as further development of favorite characters from Need, combine to make Captivate an exciting and well-written addition to this delightful series.

K.A
Mitchell made me feel the cold and remember the horribleness of snow

The setting was very real and interesting

But I couldn't  fully connect with either male lead, and I thought the ending was a bit weak

I think part of my inability to bond with the characters was because this is not a full length novel
I would have enjoyed it much more if it was

 And..


(spoiler alert)..


I totally hate the whole idea of surprise proposals in public, especially when the person who suddenly wants that kind of commitment has been gone for a long time with no meaningful communication for years
But that said, this story did not disappoint me
I really enjoyed it, but just wish it had been longer


I would have paid twice as much for another 50 pages.

$REVIEW.: This was a very difficult and intense read. It is  raw and gritty, with moments of painful beauty.I had a harder time than usual to relate to AMW&#8217;s writing.  Maybe it was the subject, perhaps the pain that emanated from Ellie&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure which was more difficult for me to handle.  Bullying is such a hot button topic in my household.  It was difficult to reconcile my liking Ellie and wanting her to have happiness, love AND hope, that when my feelings toward her changed and I truly started rooting for her it was effortless.To say Ellie was dealt a bad hand would be a gross understatement.  As she says the town was dying and taking her right along.  But there were bright moments- moments with Flynn that she was sure she didn&#8217;t deserve.  So she did what most agree, disaffected youth will do- she pushed it away.  Tormented him.  Destroying her heart and life in the process.Fast forward six years.  Flynn is back.  And all of Ellie&#8217;s friends revert back to high school.  Yet the shine that was there for Ellie and Flynn remains.Let me say that my NEED to knock some sense into Ellie&#8217;s &#8220;friends&#8221; was strong.  So much pain and destruction.Finding the strength to make it more and to put someone else&#8217;s happiness above her own seems impossible.Watching the two of them mature and connect broke my heart.  And laugh out loud.  Ultimately bringing a sense of hope that brought the entire journey together for me.  That connection made allowed the story to become even more real.  Seeing forgiveness.  Happiness. Hope.Flynn wants Ellie&#8217;s happiness.  And for them to be together- he has given her a place in his heart and life.  His innocence and honesty push Ellie to be more, want more.  But more is not in Wellsburg.The end left me needing more- more details, more love, more hope.  Yep I am a greedy one.  But the Epilogue brought it all together for me- even in its vague manner- making me use my imagination and heart to fill in the rest of their story.

$review_text.: Thoughtful, profound and completely riveting - my three-word attempt to sum up The Tunnel, a brilliant shorty story by the amazing Michael K. Rose.  This story pulls you in immediately with its perfectly crafted narrative form, moves you precisely with its language and imagery and tingles you right to the core with its remarkable concept.  Short stories of this calibre are much harder to write than they seem and Rose nails every nuance perfectly.  Rose proves he is an author who is able to find the words you've always been looking for to describe the indescribable;  he somehow articulates ideas that seem hauntingly familiar in a way that will leave you nodding your head in agreement as the goosebumps roll pleasantly down your arm.  You'll fly through this amazing story in no time then want to go right back to the start and read it again.  Yes, it's that good.  Buy this and read it.  You'll see what I mean.

$review_text.: "The Difference a Day Makes" makes all the right difference in the lives of the residents of  Perfect, Indiana

Author Barbara Longley introduced us to her "Love from the Heartland" series with Book One, "Far From Perfect", in which we met Noah Langford and Ceejay Lovejoy

Noah is a combat veteran who lost a leg during a military mission
Ceejay is the woman who had a child by Noah's step-brother who had abandoned her and stolen her money


After working their way through many difficult emotional issues, Noah and Ceejay married and he adopted the daughter she had borne his step-brother


In "The Difference a Day Makes", Noah's younger step-sister, Paige, is fired from her big-city job in a most embarrassing manner, and she seeks refuge with Noah and his family


She doesn't expect to run into Ryan Malloy, who served with Noah and was injured on the same combat mission

When she arrives at Noah's home late at night, she heads for the guest house, not knowing it's being occupied by Ryan

Their first meeting is quite a jolt to them both, with Ryan coming to the door naked and armed

He had been deep into one of his nightmares when she unlocked the door

In fact, Ryan was there by the hand of Fate--Noah had called him one night to offer him a job at his new furniture business
Ryan had just written a suicide note, and was about to pull the trigger when Noah's call literally saved his life


Ryan and Paige are immediately attracted to each other, but they hide it behind verbal jabs and sharp remarks
Eventually, they fall into a heady relationship with the promise of love and happiness just around the edges

Ryan suffers from PTSD, just like Noah, and he also tends to drown his pain in alcohol
Paige suffers from self-esteem issues as the "poor little rich girl" who longs to be wanted and accepted for the intelligent and capable person she really is inside
Ryan blames himself for the death years ago of his fianc&eacute; in a riding accident, and he also carries guilt for the combat mission that went awry, injuring himself and Noah, and taking the lives of their buddies


As Paige works alongside her brother and Ryan, she begins to feel happy and appreciated, but she still clings to her lifelong goal of making it in the corporate world

Can Paige and Ryan work on resolving their own personal issues and make compromises that could lead to happiness neither of them ever imagined? I loved "Far from Perfect", and  I read "The Difference a Day Makes" with equal enjoyment


 I look forward to reading the third book in the series, "A Change of Heart"


If you love funny, touching, contemporary romance which doesn't shy away from very real personal issues, then you will love this series from author Barbara Longley


Recommended.
