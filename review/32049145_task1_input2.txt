$review_text.: We bought this one Black Friday after we waited in line several hours for several TV's in the store. Once we didn't get them we decided to go home and look online. I ran across this and snatched it up quickly. It is AWESOME! We had never heard of this brand before buying it but thought with the specifications of it, we would give it a shot for the price. It's been GREAT 10 months later! It's picture quality is perfect. We don't use the sound on it as ours goes through our surround sound so can't comment on that aspect. But I am seeing this brand all over now and it's a GREAT TV. I would definitely buy this brand and TV again!

$review_text.: I ordered this mouse to be used with my work laptop/tablet

The trackpad on the tablet isn't as responsive as I like, and I spend a lot of time tracking through things


I bought this as an economy mouse to use instead of the trackpad

Product is a great, straightforward optical mouse


I have had no problems, just plug it in via USB and start using it

Cable length is adequate, mouse is responsive on my countertop surfaces and is surprisingly durable (I've bounced it off the tile floor more than a few times).Bottom line is: I wanted a good, cheap mouse without a bunch of bells and whistles I don't need for my work laptop
This is it.

$REVIEW.: I liked this antenna enough to buy another for my RV.Today's digital TV signals are not as robust as old school analog transmissions


Installation and alignment are important regardless of which antenna you buy or how much you spend
This is likely why every antenna listed on Amazon seems to have both good and bad reviews


It's frequently (but not always) users' installations, not the antenna that deserve low ratings.When this $20 antenna has a clear view of the desired transmission towers it provides me with stunning picture quality and rock solid signal strength in a remote Phoenix suburb.I too was disappointed when I first lazily pointed it out of a window from indoors at ground level


After spending less than an hour putting it up on the roof, (on the mast that once held my old analog antenna), I have reliable access to signals from many distant cities as well as all the local ones.It's a directional antenna, so you need to aim it at the broadcast towers

If you are replacing an old antenna you can probably just point this one in the same direction and be very happy


There are also numerous websites that can help you point you antenna
Better yet, take your smartphone up on the roof with you loaded with an app like "TV Antenna Helper." It uses GPS (or your ZIP code) to obtain a list of local TV station antenna locations

It then literally points you in the direction of the desired towers with an on-screen map.Many new TVs have built-in signal strength meters to help you optimize antenna pointing as well

Read the TV manual for details.Since this is an amplified antenna, and the electronics are inside the antenna, you must connect the provided "power inserter" directly between the TV and the antenna, then plug in the provided power supply
The same coax (wire) that carries the TV signals DOWN to your set also carries a DC voltage from the power supply and inserter UP to the amplifier.Signal splitters, attenuation devices, filters and such will usually block the DC, making the amplifier inoperative
So, if you need these, place the power inserter in the cable going up to the antenna with nothing but the cable between the inserter and the antenna


Do any splitting (antenna sharing) at the OUTPUT end of the inserter, not at the antenna end:[ TV ] -- [ Splitters and such ] -- [ Inserter/Power supply ] -- [ antenna ]Some new TVs will send the DC up the coax for you making the inserter and plug-in power supply shipped with the antenna unnecessary
The quick way to find out if yours does is to set things up using the inserter and then remove it from the equation


If the TV still gets all the same stations reliably, it's feeding DC to the antenna amp


Obviously if you use this approach you will probably not be able to share the antenna with multiple TVs.

$review_text.: I have used the Lyra for about 3 months now. This is not an audiophile-quality product, but for my purpose, which is listening to music for about an hour per day while exercizing, it can't be beat.There is a faint audio hiss that sometimes can be heard in background, almost reminiscent of the hiss from a non-Dolby cassette tape. If this was my primary audio component it would be an issue. For exercizing, not a problem at all.I have about 55 songs in the 256k memory with a little room to spare. I also have tried the memory card option and it works fine. The whole thing slips in my pocket, the volume buttons and the forward reverse buttons can be "felt" without having to look, which is good since the display is not backlit. It also has a random Shuffle mode which I like. Also, it has numerous EQ presets-I found "rock" gives the best sound over a wide range of genres, but this is a personal equation.The earplugs fit fine and provide comfort and very good quality sound. Battery life is exceptional. In three months, I have only changed the battery a few times. I use rechargables, but it only takes one "AAA" so battery cost should not be an issue.File management is a breeze. I didn't even bother installing the supplied software. It was all intuitive using Windows Media Player. One nice feature is that mine came preloaded with ten songs, which you can keep or delete, and had a coupon for 100 free downloads.

$review_text.: I put this drive into my new 15" Macbook Pro (early 2011 edition, i7 Sandy Bridge processor) to replace the stock 500GB drive.  The user replacement, which does not void the Apple warranty, took all of about 15 minutes and that was mostly because of having to remove and then replace 10 screws on the back of the Macbook Pro to get access to the drive bay.  Restored from Time Machine, and I was in business.  I had read a lot about these Intel SSD drives, but I was still surprised by how huge the change is in boot times, application loads, etc.  My OSX system boots in 13 seconds.  My Windows 7 VM session running under Parallels boots in about 20 seconds.  Large applications, even Photoshop CS5, open and load in a few seconds.  The computer is wonderfully responsive and it even seems to run a little cooler as well.  Bottom line, I love this drive.  It changes the entire computing experience.  Granted, I have had it in for only a day or so, but thus far I am extremely impressed.

My G6 works great and every time, my GH3 does not work. They are both Panasonic Lumix cameras, but the GH3 does not fire the flashgun. I have check the setting and they all seem to be set correctly.  So if you have a GH3 look for something different.  The reason I ws attracted to this cord was how long it streaches. That was a important to me the longer coiled cord give you much flexibility. For that reason I'm happy with the cord. Just does not work with some models.

There is no lag or stuttering, as many have reported in the reviews, these folks are having other problems, the Roku stick works just fine with no stuttering, lag or delay.Problem for most people is Bandwidth. Basic cable supplies a 1.5Mb or slower connection. That is barely adequate for SD streaming. If you attempt HD steaming at those speeds, guess what? It will stutter and lag...Netflix recommends at least a 5Mb connection FOR EACH stream of HD content.I have a 20Mb connection. (Time Warner Turbo) and rarely see any pixilation or lag.If you have proper bandwidth, this Roku works just fine.

In the end, I brought it to the store and they made it look easy. Its easier to get it to work laying flat then holding the security port up. I should have figured...The actual mechanism seems to work by putting the T shaped bar into the standard security port on the laptop, and then the key rotates the little pins so the bar cannot turn. The other end gets looped around something else. It's easier to lock without the rubber around the end, but then it will chafe the metal around the port. My laptop (Gateway P-6860FX) has some wear around the port from all my amateur attempts to get it working.Now that I have it working, it locks securely, provided I can find something equally secure to lock it to.

The 1/4th adapter comes screwed onto the 1/8th inch jack. They both appear gold plated and my bass guitar sounds wonderful through these. I don't think the adapter would work on any other device, however it is VERY secure and for the price it's an awesome bonus. The sound quality is very good. I can tell the difference between  256 or 320 mp3 to a lossless format easily which and lows mids and highs are all clear and if one is quieter, you are probably just hearing the difference now that you have these on!

$review_text.: This little device is what I was looking for. I did a good bit of research and settled on this unit because it had the least negative reviews. It is $20 after all.Rather than replace my current and great car CD player that does not have Bluetooth...I settled on this wired adapter. There is a cubby just below my CD player that I have never used, so I used a small strip of double-stick foam from Wal-Mart and *stickied* this device in place. I then ran a short headphone wire I had in my desk (you may need to purchase this) and plugged into the AUX on my CD player. I also used the included USB charge wire and plugged it into my cigarette lighter USB charger (double-USB Belkin from Wal-Mart). This way I can charge the adapter AND phone at the same time if needed. I don't get the noise some are experiencing though.The unit will turn it self off after being idle (I'm not sure how long) or out of range of the phone.Each time I get in my truck, I start the music on my phone and set it down. I then press and hold the power button for a few seconds unit it makes an audible ding in the speakers and starts playing music. Done.

But I can say that my personal experience was excellent.I was replacing an ATI Wonder 600 HDTV USB Tuner.  This device was only picking up 1 or 2 channels, but it was enough for me to see how nice Windows Media Center could be so I decided to give this card a try.  Installation was a breeze, and immediately I was able to pick up 90% of the local OTA channels in sharp HD.  I also tested out the QAM tuner, and was pleasantly surprised at the number of channels my cable company was transmitting unencrypted.  It was difficult to figure out what channels were what, but the card does provide cable access to TV w/o the need for a cable box.If you have a modern box running Window 7 and want a Tivo-quality DVR platform, I would highly recommend this product.

Every time I think I've got it figured out, the iPad falls out again.  I finally gave up and purchased a different cover that keeps the iPad safe and secure.

$review_text.: Best ones I've used for sound quality and voice quality on calls.  Only big complaints are the the same as most headphones...once the ear buds come off, its near impossible to get them to stay on again and the filter to protect the innards from wax clogs easily and when cleaning, the mesh just falls off (and there's no replacement).  I travel heavily and these have survived well - still have to treat them carefully because I don't think they're robust enough to just toss around and yank on, but with a little care they seem to do alright.

$REVIEW.: The product has an excellent performance, it does what it has to do and beyond, it looks very sleek and feels sturdy

The led light is just perfect, it automatically turns off after a while, so there is no risk it will get burned, also when charging it will stop automatically once is fully charge


The charging time is relatively longer than expected but not a big deal

I would recommend it to anyone who wants an elegant and very functional product
Even though it looks nice and feels pretty well, my only concern by now is that it is not scratch resistant, it already has one ugly scratch, bad idea to put the charging cable into the travel bag together with it :( to avoid more scratches on it, I use the same travel bag as a surface protector

Also it gets dirty easily from your fingers, it's not fingerprints resistant at all, so it needs cleaning constantly to keep it look shinny.


$SUMMARY.: Not scratch and fingerprints resistant.

$REVIEW.: I could confirm most of the ratings by others: great specs, terrible reality. I was looking for a router with simultaneous 2.4 and 5GHz bands with separate Guest access, so was the choice (with refurb 1GB unit around 100 bucks). But... 5GHz range is close to nothing (feasible only in the same room), might be due to the internal antennas. The share (or the mapped disk) gets unavailable with no reason. But what is worst for me and happened yesterday, I just cannot access one of the directories I've made. Total Commander shows no files within (but does not open that directory), Win XP explorer shows "Folder is Empty" pop-up 0 bytes, 0 Files, 0 Folders (but does not explre nor open directory, with pop-up window message "\\192.168.x.y\Public\Folder\Subfolder is not accessible. You might not have permission to use that network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. The specified server cannot perform the requested operation". I am on a fortunate side it was within one hour of making full backup of this specific subfolder to my local computer, so I do not loose much of the data, but if that wasn't, brrr... YOU CANNOT RELY ON THIS PRODUCT FOR YOUR WORK, IT'S JUST A TOY.

$review_text.: This is the exact same controller that comes with the PS3. It works great. Amazon seemed to be the cheapest around at the time, and probably still is.I did notice I have to be careful when using the control to navigate on Netflix or Vudu when watching a movie. The L2 and R2 buttons are sensitive and can accidentally get pressed when setting the controller down. In Vudu this fast forwards or rewinds chapters.The controller fits well in my hands. After getting accustomed to it and whatever game I am playing, controlling seems quite fluid.I love the wireless aspect. The PS3 will let you know when the battery low and it is time to switch to a charged controller.

$review_text.: I think these put out very clean, clear and wide range sound


 They sound best at low to medium volume


Listening to a symphony I could hear the individual instruments better than on other speakers I have


I've heard more "pleasing" sound, but think these are amazing for such small speakers.There is a bass port in the back of each, I hear the bass better if I keep them away from the wall.2 connection wire pairs are included, about 6 feet long, black&red; so it's easy to keep + and - straight
They look like 22 AWG to me
Adequate for low amperage, but definitely not monster cable.Can connect with bare wire or banana plugs.

The video images is very grainny under low light condition. Unuseable pixelated movie that can't tell the face or any details(color is wash out). You can only get decent video clip under bright day light or min. 2 x 100 watts light bulb lumination.Go for one with night vision or at least 2 Lux DVR if you want decent video clips otherwise if you can live with lousy image when condition get dark using this Stealth!I also find this camera with such poor quality video recording grossly over priced. Many cheaper spy cameras produces far sharper images then this. This is my personal experience and opinion.

$REVIEW.: Garmin has been making the eTrex line for years and you'd think they'd have some of the basics figured out by now.  the joystick control is maddeningly difficult to use, it's almost impossible to click it directly downward to select a menu item once you've highlighted it.  it's hard enough under the best circumstances and even worse when wearing gloves or when the weather is cold, etc.  the basic functionality of the GPS unit is great, but trying to use that terrible joystick control to navigate the menus really ruins the whole experience.

I'm just a hobbyist digital artist and only use it about 1-3 hours a day depending on my mood.I use Wacom Bamboo Capture Pen and Touch Tablet (CTH470) with the Wireless Accessory Kit.

$REVIEW.: Here is the bottom line on this drive:  it comes with PowerDVD8 software... which does not play newer Blu-Ray titles.  Why would anyone want a Blu-Ray player that doesn't play all Blu-Ray titles?  That's what it comes down to.Don't expect any help from Samsung or Cyberlink.In addition, as several users have indicated, there are significant hardware requirements.  Not only do you have to have a Blu-Ray compliant monitor (of course, stands to reason), both your GRAPHICS CARD and your MOTHERBOARD itself must be Blu-Ray compliant (good luck figuring out if your motherboard qualifies. LOL).  In the endgame ask yourself this:  just how important to you is it to play Blu-Ray from your DESKTOP COMPUTER?  Unless you're copying Blu-Rays or using them for data, you will likely be better off going down and buying a $150 Blu-Ray deck and hooking it to your nice 40" television.So, don't buy this drive unless a) you want a potential hassle making your system compliant and b) you feel like going out and spending cash on PowerDVD 10... because the included PowerDVD 8 does not work.For the vast majority of people, this system simply will not operate.

$review_text.: This is the single worst piece of electronics I have ever owned.  It is impossible to keep this thing charged.  Sometimes you plug it in and it will partially charge, sometimes fully charge, sometimes, won't charge at all.If you let it go completely dead, it will not come back to life until you do some random series of things and  then  it will mysteriously come back to life.when it works, it's so overloaded with nonsense that you have to throw half the preinstalled stuff away just to get it down to something simple.I do not have an ipad, so I can't compare.  I just know everyone who has one likes it, and I really don't like this thing, so I have to believe there is some significant  difference.The form factor on this is not good  - more convenient to pack into things, but when you are using a web page , you will be CONSTANTLY expanding and contracting the screen.Volume is terrible.Perhaps as a bedside reader it might work I guess.

But the newest generation iPad has a better resolution and smoothness of text compared to the first and second generation iPads and it's much better than the Kindle DX reading device. The only issue is the screen glaring which is not comfortable if sitting nearby the light source.IMHO it's worth to upgrade from iPad two if you read a lot of text and watch HD videos on netflix. For other uses like occasional browsing, reading emails and gaming: The iPad 2 is a good option for a lower price.

$REVIEW.: It's not a bad little camera, but one big thing I found is it's hard to get a decent steady shot


Most any camcorder your going to need a tripod, and this one is no exception

 The image can become shaky even though the zoom is quite smooth

You can really notice the shakiness when at full zoom


The still pictures left a lot to be desired.It has not only an easy mode but the settings most wanna be pro videographers want as well
Most people will probably just set it on auto and go, which is probably best since playing with some of the settings manually didn't improve the video that much.I think given its size this is probably something that's great for the mom or dad that wants something offers a bit more than a Flip style video camera will give you.

I installed the EVO and the kind people at the Apple Genius Bar assisted me with the partition, putting on the operation system  as well as the data transfer free of charge and with a great attitude.  The difference in performance is very impressive.  For example when I upgraded my Macbook Pro from 4GB of RAM to 8GB of RAM I noticed a significant improvement in performance.  But going tom a conventional Hard Drive to the Solid State Drive is Staggering. I'm glad when it was time for my original Hard-drive to go that the SSD. like the Samsung Evo finally hit a price that the upgrade made sense.Its only been a couple of months but so far I'm thrilled with the upgrade and hopping to get a couple more years  of the or more at of my Macbook Pro.

$REVIEW.: I think there are some unlucky people and some impatient people purchasing this unit.  I sincerely could not believe how low the average score was for it.  I wonder if some of the reviewers are getting their products used / already defective from dodgy sources online.  It's amazing how many people still assume they are getting new product when it could be an auction for something that has been sitting in someone's garage.Anyway, on to the player:First, to respond to some of the complaints:It is annoying to have to hook it up via composite to see anything before you turn on the component output.  However this is sadly not unique to Toshiba.  It is also annoying that no remote region hack seems to have slipped out the back door for this unit.  I'd bet almost anything that one exists.  So for those two faults alone I dock one star.[Edit: I now know this unit can in fact be made region-free.  I would change it to five stars if I could.]Otherwise, I am completely happy.  Picture and sound are great after nudging the brightness one click to better match my already calibrated tv.  This is coming from someone admittedly a little picky.  I was coming from a Yamaha with great pic and sound; I just didn't feel like dropping another 150 on a player when I hope dvd recorders with ATSC tuners will be available soon.  I tried a Philips for one day - returned for sucking, just so you know I'm not easily pleased.It looks good, sounds good, loads fast, runs quiet, doesn't lock up, plays a ton of formats, and can be had for fifty.  What else do you want?BTW a video store near me uses one of these thirteen hours a day.

$review_text.: This is by far one of the best iPod speaker systems available - no bass or treble controls, and you definitely don't need them - Harman Kardon has designed this to play all music with fantastic fidelity - load up your iPod with a bunch of your favorite music (I've got 3900+ songs on my 80GB iPod w/video so far - only 55GB of space left!), set it to shuffle, and you can listen to one terrific song after another - just like programming your own high-quality radio station anywhere you go - you won't be sorry with this purchase, especially at Amazon's sale price...I'm an old audiophile, and I poo-pood MP3 for years - now I'm sold on it for the convenience, and the sound quality from quality equipment is more than acceptable

$review_text.: I purchased these banana plugs for the same reason everybody else does, to make their own speaker cables using convenient banana plug connects.  These are easy to use, have a double screw tie down and the finish collar, screws over the tie down screws to give the connection a finished look.The short review version: I've purchased and used many different connections and overall, for the price, these are the best I've found.  Yes, you can spend more as one can for everything they buy but these hit the middle ground nicely for looks, manufactured quality, price and packaged quantity.Now the longer review version.  The connection is easy to make and once made, is a secure connection so one doesn't have to worry if the connection is bad or not.  With the two screws snugged up, the connection is what I consider to be a "very" tight, permanent, connection.FYI, all of our speaker cables are 12AWG (American Wire Gauge) wire.  Yes one can use smaller gauge wire but I see no reason to use smaller gauge wire to save a few pennies a foot.  Twelve AWG wire fits the interior barrel of this banana plug nicely.I've made several speaker cables with these banana plugs and found them to be easy to work with and they make a positive connection when connected to the back of the receiver.  Overall, these are a well priced product and the buyer gets lots of pairs in each of the packages so they'll have plenty of plugs to connect their 5.1 system with.  If doing a full 7.1 system, one will need four more banana plugs as a 7.1 system need a total of twenty-eight plugs to connect all seven speakers to the receiver and this package has 24 banana plugs.If you like simple, these banana plugs will make you happy and they're much less expensive then going to your local "Shack" for speaker wire supplies.Hope the above helps.
$SUMMARY.: Excellent product at an excellent price.

The SSD drive made my PC boot up in 18 seconds, usable in 18 seconds.... I built a desktop with an i3 and 8 gb of RAM. The SATA 7200 drive seemed fast but WOW this is a huge difference. This drive was a great value, came with a high quality cable that connects both SATA power and data ports to USB and a disc for image copying using a program provided. The image copying program was easy to use and straight forward... within an hour I transferred my OS and data to the drive. I physically swapped them out and booted up the system.

$review_text.: As a freelance photographer I have really put this camera through the ropes.  It offers outstanding features and lets you see "real time" the effect you're having on the exposure as you change the settings.  It has a really convenient quick-view mode, which allows you to quickly flick through pictures without putting the camera on "view" mode.These are the camera's strong points:- Great built in filters- A wealth of top-shelf features- Amazing zoom range, and- Very intuitive traditional controlsBut alas nothing in life is perfect.  Most reviewers here have faulted battery life - trivial compared to these issues:TIFF and RAW - Completely useless.  Don't ever bother with them if you want to shoot multiple shots.  TIFF and RAW files take an outrageous amount of time to save to the compact flash card rendering them useless.  Don't use, unless you have an unchanging subject and all day to shoot it.Auto ISO - It will always pick a ISO setting that is too high and generate an unacceptable amount of noise in your images, especially in low light.  If you notice noisy pictures, just set the ISO manually and counter balance it with your exposure biasing.To sum up, a great camera with only two flaws.  That's the least I've ever experienced with any camera.  Go for it!

 It does have a decent picture given the low price but not good enough quality to call it worth while in any kind of identification of numbers or people

 It will let someone know if a vehicle is missing in the driveway but that is all it is good for and then it needs to be ethernet wired to have any type of reliable wifi connection

 I have found that most of the cameras in this price range are a waste of money other than a toy to play with to learn how ip cameras work.

$REVIEW.: As some others have noticed, this amplifier did not come with a power supply which is annoying to say the least and miss leading at the worst.I was fortunately able to find an adapter I could repurpose from my junk pile. I did have to cut the plug from one adapter and attach it to anotherto make it work. I opened this amplifier up and can say it is poorly made but that is what I would expect from a 21 dollar amplifier. Having saidthat it does work well with the following caveats. Do not use it past the 90% on the volume and do not use the treble or the bass at their maximumas they caused excess distortion at least on my unit. This is based on looking at the output with a with a scope and keeping the input below 2 volt pk-pkor .707 volt RMS. My iTouch would not overdrive the input at full volume. This unit  will drive 8 ohm speakers at a somewhat lower level and it looks likethe output filters a designed for 4 ohms. They should charge a little more and include the wall adapter or at a minimum let you know you need to supplyone.

$REVIEW.: We wanted a new surround system as our old one finally died.  We have a 21x28' family room connected to an open space kitchen and dining with almost no wall on that side so wiring is a pain and the total space is huge.  We originally wanted wireless speakers for the back but after listening to several systems in the $500-700 range we just couldnt beat sound quality from the Bose.  It was simple to install with our 50" plasma, Dish receiver and Bluray player BUT your surround/audio settings on your tv must be set correctly for it to function as it should.  At first I was a little dissapointed that it didnt have all the distinct, clear sounds like the demo, but after checking my tv audio setup realized that we were not setting our HD output correctly and WA-LA, we had the sound of individual glasses clinking, birds singing and things moving from left to right, etc.  The dialogs were also quite clear and distinct.  Its all in comprehensive setup and what comes from your connected equipment.  Now Im loving it and would definitely recommend this to anyone.  Especially if you dont want to deal with wiring rear speakers or pay more for wireless rear speakers.  Thumbs up.

$review_text.: I'm not a Star Wars buff

I got this item simply because I'm an Amazon Vine reviewer and they were among the most interesting items on that particular list
Also, I thought my nine year old daughter might become a Star Wars fan at some point so maybe it would be of interest to her then

Finally, we can always use another pair of good headphones in our household


As headphones, they're great
Very good sound comes through and stays nicely contained within


And the 'phones comes in handy, attractive case

As for the Star Wars goods, I feel like the set is a little light on that

Again, I'm not a Star Wars geek myself, but in looking through what comes with the set and imagining that I'm a SW fan, I think I would be a little disappointed


There's the box it all comes in then a couple little booklets and a Darth Vader poster
So my overall feeling is that if you're thinking of getting this for the Star Wars gear, I can't really recommend it


But if you'd be happy to have a nice pair of headphones that come with just a little Star Wars stuff, go for it.

$review_text.: Logitech has always made, in my opinion, fantastic mice and keyboards
They are not the best in the market, but from an economical point of view, they are a top competitor for the average consumer

This keyboard offers quite a bit for a small price

I have owned this keyboard(and now 2 others) for about a year and a half and have relied on it heavily as a gamer

It gets at least 4 hours of use daily and has performed fantastically since purchase


The software that it can talk to once installed is also very convenient for such things and power level, caps/num lock being on and off, and disabling unused keys.The one and only issue I have had with this keyboard involves its communication with the mini unifying dongle it comes with
If this keyboard is at a certain distance from the receiver, it will hang up or stall in connection, requiring the user to flip the keyboard up or move it slightly for the receiver to pick back up its connection
I have yet to isolate this issue to make sure it is only this connection that is causing issue but have dealt with it since purchase.Though it is wireless, I recommend purchasing a usb male to female cable to extend the receiver up to the desktop instead of plugging it into the front or back of the PC flush with the case

I feel that bring it closer to the keyboard and in a better line of sight to it allows for perfect connections every time without hang ups or disconnections
I have zero issues now that I have the receiver plugs in this way with the usb male to female cable tied down to one of my speakers on the desk


This allows for the best connections while still keeping the receiver far out of sight.

$REVIEW.: All the camera I could ever want.  Amazing ergonomics.  All the customization I need.  Picture quality to salivate for... especially low light capability.  I've owned the previous version of this camera, the Pentax K10d which uses the 10 MP chip made by Sony which is also used in several Nikon cameras like the D80, and high ISO pics (like 800 and above) are a bit noisy in these older cameras which require a bit more work to get rid of the graininess.  The K20d on the other hand is much cleaner at these higher ISO's with a lot of detail.  Most other cameras in this class tend to use a lot of noise reduction at these higher ISO's which makes for a relatively clean picture but these cameras also reduce a lot of sharpness and detail in the process.  The K20d leaves the detail and sharpness and lets me use more advanced noise reduction software to take care of the areas that I think need it (try noiseninja or neat image).Weather sealing - awesome for those who like to hike, sports, or street photography.  I took my camera and a da* Pentax weather sealed lens in to a snowstorm and had no concerns taking pictures... And this kind of build quality that helps keep water and dust out of your camera is something you can feel: the camera is just solid and feels like it laughs at the elements.Image stabilization in the body - EVERY lens you put on this camera will benefit from image stabilization.  I took some pictures in an old church which was not lit well at all, and even without a tripod, I was taking pictures with a 50mm lens at 1/20th of a second and the vast majority of my images were sharp.  My old camera without stabilization required me to have shutter speeds of around 1/80th to get reliably sharp images.  This is a difference of 4 times as much light the camera needs to make an equally exposed picture!  The images at 1/20th are much better exposed and I don't have to turn up the ISO to a point where the image is too grainy like I would have to do on other cameras without stabilization.  This feature is especially important if you take pictures indoors... lower shutter speeds without blinding everybody with flash is so much less intrusive.Custom Focus Adjustment - as much as we expect perfection, lenses often have differences in how they focus.  Being able to adjust the focus forward or backwards on up to 20 lenses is critical if you want razor sharp images.  This is a main reason I upgraded from the K10d... it makes a huge difference!14.6 MP - This much detail is clearly not necessary... unless you need to crop.  I find that if I need a fast lens because of low light (say, if I need an f stop of lower than 2) then I'm usually using a prime lens (fixed focal length = no zoom) and sometimes I can't get as close as I'd like b/c of furniture or maybe the action is happening NOW and I don't have time to move.  With this many megapixels, I can crop a lot and focus on the important part of my picture and still have enough detail to print 8x10's or even 11x14's if I want.Yes, this camera is a few hundred dollars more than an entry level DSLR... but really it should be much, much more expensive than that.  It's an amazing camera that I could easily use for many years.  And my pictures have benefited from it... Getting this quality of a camera for less than a thousand bucks is an amazing value!

My micro usb sd card adapter would not work (spoke with HP technical support this function is not supported in the slate).  My digital camera uses SD cards, so I purchased a micro SD card with the adapter.  After trying this out, I decided that it would not be practical to view my photographs using the micro sd card.  Reason - I would be constantly taking the micro sd card out of the adapter in the camera, then placing the micro sd card in the tablet. Micro sd cards are extremely fragile, in fact the one I bought was damaged the first time I put it in the adapter.

The 1T drive sitting next to it is still kicking along and it got most of the work.  (Data drive for HTPC)  Solid state should last longer.  Next time I'll try a big name.

$review_text.: In my review for the Opteka Flash Sync cordOpteka E-TTL / E-TTL II Off-Camera Flash Sync Cord for Canon EOS Cameras & Speedlite Flashes (Canon OC-E3 Equivalent)which I purchased through Amazon just didn't work after trying to mount and dismount the sync cord.  After spending good money on good equipment and after returning the non-functioning Opteka product to Amazon (they are fantastic on their return policies) I ordered the Canon sync cord and it worked the moment it was installed.  It is mounted on a StroboframeStroboframe Quick Flip 350 Flash Bracket for 35mm Camerasto my Canon 60DCanon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (Body Only)and works well together.The lock on the mount is the surprising thing on the Canon sync cord.  The mount is on the camera hot shoe and it clicks in place by moving a lever.  To unmount this, there is a safety button that must be pressed to release the mounting lever.  This helps to keep the mount in place while doing an active photo shoot.  Comparing both sync units side by side, the Canon cord is much more durable and solid.  I was a little concerned over Opteka's mount to the flash and although I locked my Canon speedlight unit onto the mount, the Opteka felt unsure and I was concerned over breakage.  But since the Opteka never worked for me I didn't have to worry about the flash falling off.For off-camera use the sync cord is a must.  I've read in another review that the cord is too short.  In that case use a transmitter, buy another sync cord to daisy-chain it, or allow the Canon camera to fire the compatible flash unit.  It works very well.So I go back to my original thesis, and that is if you are spending serious money on your equipment, stick with the original thing.  Yes, you will pay more for the accessories but then again it IS designed to work in concert with your camera.  That's why you bought the Canon system in the first place.  It will also save you the hassle of purchasing a knock-off and then buying the genuine item later down the road to replace the one that broke.  Happy sync-ing!

$review_text.: I was looking for a slim, easy way to have storage on my key chain (a slim, rugged USB stick like LaCie would have worked) but also to transfer easily to my phones MicroSD slot.The Elago seemed to fit the bill pretty well. It's the same size as a USB port with a little nub sticking out and the MicroSD slot actually appears to slide into the USB plug (it does not though), making this whole thing amazingly slim.The USB cap cover is a bit of a challenge to take off initially, and big fingers may have a challenge to grip it since it is pretty small. I found an 8GB microSD, plugged it into a Macbook and formatted as FAT32. Worked well and now I have a way to transfer photos from my Android microSD slot to my PC quickly (as most PC's do not have a MicroSD ready - you need to add ANOTHER reader just to read it) and vice versa.I suppose another option to transfer files back and forth would be one of those wireless storage, but then I have to worry about carrying another piece of equipment and charging it when its battery goes dead.This is much handier for me as it fits on a keyring (note: the keyring hole is tiny so only a small coil will work) and is ready for use while I go about my day.Four stars for practical operation. I knocked off one star for the following:* not as slim as the LaCie Iamakey - it's about the thickness of two keys. I actually wouldn't mind if the Elago was the size/shape and thickness of a Iamakey. On the other hand, the LaCie is USB drive only, not an SD reader.* Because of its diminutive size, it can be hard to grasp and plug/unplug in a USB socket. There are a couple of ridges on either side of the plug, and I tied the string loop it comes with into the keyring hole, tugged on it, and the string broke.Some questions remain which everyone should be aware of:* MicroSD cards are available up to 64GB these days. I only tried 8GB and am confident it would work up to 16, maybe 32GB in the Elago.* Formatting the cards between different OS/equipment is another issue which you will have to read up on. The 64GB microSD have a different file format and may not be able to be formatted as FAT32 - instead use NTFS for PC. However, check operation if you are using it between a MAC and an Android phone, like I am. NTFS is not recognized (it is Microsoft's) and formatting a 64GB card in either the MAC or Android may also not make it readable. I had this kind of compatibility/readability/cross-platform operational issue with a 64GB USB drive. You should be ok up to 32GB and FAT32. Just something to be aware of. Another choice to avoid all this, is to use Dropbox and other cloud services for file transfer (so long as you have internet access when you need it).

They didn't immediately come off, but the instructions state for hard-to-remove spots, breath on the lens and wipe again.  This worked like a charm, and I can't even tell there were any spots on the lens afterwards.  Not sure how long these last, but hope it will still be available from here when I need a new one.

$review_text.: I have been using low-cost appliance NAS devices in SOHO environments for seven years.  My first NAS was the HP MV2020 Media Vault that used a Linux O/S and offered 500GB storage with gigabit network connectivity.  My positive experience with the MV2020 compelled me to later upgrade to the HP MV2100 Media Vault which benefited from larger drive capacities and an improved chassis.  Both devices delivered solid performance and are still running today.  This BlackArmor device was my first experience with a Seagate NAS and I'm happy to report that is compares to, and in many cases, exceeds the performance of the HP Media Vaults.#1 System setup was quick and easy.  I had the device out of the box, plugged in, and connected to my network in less than 10 minutes.#2 Transfer speeds are commendable at 16.8 MB/second for downloads and 12.5 MB/second for uploads.  Transfer rates were captured using Intel's NAS Performance Toolkit (which is an excellent free tool for easy testing in a SOHO network - downloadable on Intel's website).  For more information on my test procedures, see below.**  While 16.8 MB/second isn't blazing fast (I've seen gigabit transfer rates top out at 45 MB/second), I can't blame the Seagate BlackArmor - I use a fairly cheapBuffalo Technology AirStation High Power N300 Gigabit Wireless Router & AP WZR-HP-G300NH (Black)router so it may very well be the culprit of lower transfer rates.  Regardless, the Seagate BlackArmor performance was 2x faster than either HP Media Vault.#3 Power consumption was overall very low compared to both HP Media Vaults.  Using the excellentP3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor, consumption was reported at 17 watts while the device was being used.  Thanks to the "BlackArmor Manager Power Save" feature, you can command the drives to spin down when not in use.  Unfortunately, this feature is not enabled by default, so make sure you set this up from the System menu's "Advanced" page.  Power consumption after "spin down" was under 10 watts.  Over a one-month period, the BlackArmor used 8.6 kilowatt hours, which at our local rate and tier, is roughly $4 per month in electricity - not bad for a 24x7 network storage device.My biggest frustration with the BlackArmor NAS is its lack of support for non-APC UPS battery systems.  The BlackArmor has a nice feature that powers down the device when it senses diminishing backup battery reserves - but this only works with APC UPS devices.  I'm a big fan of CyberPower and I have the BlackArmor connected to aCyberPower CP1350AVRLCD Intelligent LCD Green UPS - 1350VA/810W AVR 8-Outlet RJ11/45/Coax(which by the way uses hardly any kwh).Pros:- Large capacity and flexible - 4TB in RAID1 or RAID0- Easy to use administration site and client software- Power save feature that spins down drives when not in use- Excellent documentation via PDF and online- No fan noise- Small footprint (compared to HP Media Vaults)Cons:- No support for non-APC UPS- External power converter (also gets hot)- Spindle noise (clicks, spinning, etc.) from HDDs is noticeable** Speed tests were conducted using Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate, an Intel i7 processor,Western Digital 2 TB Caviar Green SATA II Intellipower 64 MB Cache Bulk/OEM Desktop Hard Drive - WD20EARSprimary partition drive, gigabit Ethernet card, a gigabit router, CAT6 patch cables, and a 140MB m4v file.

$REVIEW.: Bought this along with an HDMI converter for a Wii to connect to a new 46-in Sony LCD TV.  Picture came up with horrible static and video noise.  I presumed it was probably a bad HDMI-for-the-Wii converter, but figured I'd swap the cable first with a known good one before sending back the converter.  Not so; the problem was a bad cable.  A generic $14 HDMI cable that I bought at CVS pharmacy at 10pm produces a perfect digital picture.The cable from Amazon is noticeably thin and cheap.  At $1.69 it wasn't even worth returning.  Expensive digital cables are overkill for typical users and make no practical difference in data transmission.  On the other hand, this cable proves you can go too cheap.

$review_text.: I bought this card along withCreative Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium HD Internal Sound Card with THX SB1270for my new PC

I read so many good reviews about the soundcard

However, after tried so many different musics (CD quality), I found it can only provide slightly better music playback with a mid-level destop speaker system (Logitech Z906, 500W+)

It could perform much better if I used a $1000+ speaker system, but as far as a $400 level destop speak system, I can barely say a difference
With Shure SE535, I did notice a significant improvement over Creative X-Fi Titanium HD
But that is not what I bought Xonar for, I almost never use earphone on a PC


Xonar does not support surround sound indicating it isnt good for movie playback and so it isnt

I only recommend this card to those headphone users.

$REVIEW.: I brought the Verizon version for its hardware
I read the Verizon version will work on other carriers but the same is NOT true of the ATT - so for me its was protecting the resale value.Love the LTE speed.I got the 32 Gb version since the 16 is way to low for me for the books and magazines I read.In a pinch I can use the tethering feature on it if my cable goes out and I dont think verizon cares - as long as I dont suddenly spike on my data usage

 The same cant be said of ATT.The ipad itself is so much easier to handle


 Its sooo much lighter than the regular iPad


after using it I cant get over how heavy the 10 inch one is.I also had a regular sized 32Gb iPad 3 w/ RD


and sold it to get the asus transformer prime


I got it since it had one feature I wanted, the expandable memory


I loved the Prime at first but it was glitchy and got slower over time


 But it was never quite as smooth as polished as iOS
I guess google needs to work on improving their "photocopier".I started using my wife's iPad one day and just kept using it since it was so much smoother and it never froze up like the prime.I decide to get a mini since it had just come out and it was cheaper
I got the 32 Gb LTE version for a little more than the base regular wi-fi only ipad with 16 Gb.The non-retina display is not a big deal for me even though I had a iPad 3 and a iphone 4 (replaced w/ a 5)


The resolution IS better than a non-retina display iPad but not as good as the ipad 4 w/ RD

Bottom line its good enough to watch movies and view pictures or magazines on.The mini with LTE is the perfect size for using as a gps in the car


 Its way bigger than almost all gps provided in any car right now
Plus it doesnt cost +$2K like it does as an option on a car.Its also the perfect size to use to control my TV as a remote for Apple TV, Comcast (although I have the wrong cable box right now), ...Cons: The only down side thats important to me was the lack of expandable memory

But I did find a fix for that
 I use aSeagate GoFlex Satellite Mobile Wireless Storage 500 GB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STBF500101 Black

It lets me stream wirelessly up to 500 Gb of movies, music or whatever to my ipad
 It even works if I dont have a wi-fi signal since it generates its own signal

 And upto 3 devices can watch 3 different movies at the same time

pretty cool.

However, after only about 2 weeks of normal usage the rubber gripper lip which is in the grove that the iPad actually sits in has become unglued.  Without this rubber grip the iPad FALLS backward.  Forget about using it on the plane.  Even just sitting on my desk I've had my iPad fall back on the desk after only 10 minutes of non-distrubed, not use - just sitting in the keyboard.Bottom-line, while this looks nice and appears to work well, it reality, it will work up until just after you have the ability to return it.Logitech can probably easily fix this if they want to.

$review_text.: I just finished doing a comparison of three point and shoot cameras that I own. Sony P100, Sony P150 and the Canon G5. For overal quality I put my vote with the Canon G5. The Sony P100 is an excellent camera and of course the P150 is the next step up. But what I notice with both of my Sony cameras is that they do tend to blur far more frequently than the Canon. I get better video results with the Canon as well. For very smalll cameras the two Sonys are terrific. The Sony serves me well enough for a vest pocket camera on my daily hike. My in the glovebox camera is the Canon G5. And for my professional photography I use 2 of the Canon 10D. In my side-by-side testing I found that I got more blurred shots with P150 than I did with the P100. I don't know why. I had both the Sonys and the Canon G5 set on P, no flash, 400, indoor lighting.  So for a vest pocket camera I would save a few bucks and get a used P100. The 150 just isn't worth the extra $$$ If you aren't going to carry a camera in your pocket I would get the Canon G5. If you want even better pictures then get a Canon Rebel digital. If you want the top of the line get a Canon 10D or the new 20D. Whichever one you get, ENJOY yourself!

 The shop had wanted us to buy the part that included the motor, so it took a bit more effort to replace the antenna since they had to remove the broken plastic track which took additional time
 But, it can be done for a reasonable amount.



$review_summary.: Replacement part worked out well

$REVIEW.: Pros:- Smaller than a mouse pad, really frees-up desk space.- No wires on your desk anymore- Wonderful modern design. Looks like a work of art.- The ability to scroll, zoom, backspace, and rotate quicker than a mouse.- It's all about the futuristic industrial design.Cons:- It needs to be on a hard flat surface in order to left and right click.BUT... this can be overcome by using squeezing the lower right or lower left hand corners.

$REVIEW.: Having used almost exclusively the metal Stroboframe shoes as well as the Manfrotto shoes for many years, this is by far the most secure shoe you will ever own. Not only do you secure with your Nikon SB series speedlights locking pin, but you have the aditional flange on the Frio that once the speedlight slides on there is no way to take it off without depressing the elevated flange on the Frio. Excellent design with 1/4 and 3/8 thread metal mounting flanges so no matter what light stand or even tripod you may be using you WILL get a secure fit. Lightweight, very functional and very secure especially now with strobes being used more and more in the field. Own it!

The cable is only 4 feet long, but it gets it out from under my desk.  Speedtest blows away my old N card.Only issue I had was that the pin orientation on the bluetooth cable is labeled backwards.  I flipped it over and bluetooth worked.

$REVIEW.: For the price it's not bad


But it's not as great, as others have made it out to be.Pros: Gold plated front, good threads, dual grounding points, lifetime warranty and price.Cons: No difference from any other splitter for modem use

Back plate is glued, not soldered and is made of aluminum (which is not gold plated)

The casing of the splitter is also thin, at around 2/3rd of a standard splitter
Plus the retention clips are not gold plated and get stuck open.I have tried 4 kinds of splitters..
Monster, This, Extreme Broadband and Antronix
I would rate Monster #1, Antronix #2, RCA #3 and Extreme Broadband #4.The best thing for me was to get a Tap, with attenuator, splitter and terminator and then even out my 3 lines signal levels

I got all 3 lines with in 1 dBmV

It increased my signal to noise ratio, to that of a direct line to the modem


My thanks goes to the top rated poster, for telling me to level out power levels on all lines.So, the choice is yours.

$REVIEW.: I bought a Nikon S9100 (from Bestbuy) for each of my kids (2) last Christmas.  The freezing problem I see reported appears to be systemic.  One of ours has already been back to Nikon for repair, and now both are doing it again.  Sometimes you turn it on and all you get is a black screen (remove battery).  Other times, the LCD turns on and you can see the view finder but the buttons don't function (remove the battery).  Very frustrating when you're trying to enjoy a vacation to say the least.Myself, I purchased a S8100 and have been pretty satisfied but will likely go back to Cannon for my next point & shoot cameras.

$REVIEW.: I had been using RS U-75R 15-2160 indoors until the digital transition when a few stations went back to VHF which this antenna was not designed for.  As a stop gap measure, I took a pair of rabbit ears that came with one of those old TVs, rubber-band tied them to the boom of the U-75R and extended all the way at an angle around 90 degrees.  Without even connecting the leads, amazingly, I got all available VHF channels.So the rig worked but was a little clunky and that was why I hoped that the ANT751 could be an elegant replacement.  It did comparably well with closer stations but was outmatched on a further VHF-13 station (&lt; 30 miles).  Needless to say, I went  back to my trusty old rig.Moral of the story: do not throw away those telescope rabbit ears, you never know when you may need them.Tip: if you need VHF out of your old UHF hardware, try my rabbit ear trick.
$SUMMARY.: Average, maybe a little more

$REVIEW.: I ordered this based on reviews, size closed and weight. I'm very happy I ordered this. As a matter of fact I'm ordering a second one a soon as I finish this review. One for traveling and one for carrying in the jeep so I'll have it when I need it. It's sturdy enough for a Nikon D40 or D90 with an 18-200 zoom lens and gives you just the right amount of support for the job. Especially when coupled with the VR lens. It's just great. Now like others mentioned ... the strap is crap. The webbing used is too stiff for the buckle to secure. Trash it and pick up a lashing strap at your local REI or backpacking shop. Trim to length (a little longer in my case) and you can use it as a wrist strap ... and the Monopod can be used as a light duty walking stick inbetween shots. It comes in handy for pushing brush out of the way to get that just right spot for the just perfect shot. If you need a monopod ... or just want one. This is the one. So small and light weight you don't mind carrying it along. I even pop it in my messenger bag to use when I need a steady shot with my point and shoot in the factory overseas.Besides it's a Manfrotto and well represents the quality level you'd expect.Update ... see photos ... I picked up the rubber walking tips for Leki treking poles (REI $9/pair) and they fit snuggly on the tip of the monopod. This gives you a more durable tip to use this monopod as a light weight walking staff. WORKS GREAT. I put some silicon sealent in the top of the tip after my first use. This keeps the dirt out. I also keep the lower section with the tip fully retracted. That's the weakest section and works out perfectly height wise for a walking staff. I'm just under 6 foot.

$REVIEW.: Ordered this battery after my Apple battery had mushrooming problems after only 2 years of use.  Being a college student I wanted to save as much cash as possible.  I was somewhat concerned with reviews stating this product did not work/fit/ect but at the price I decided to take a gamble before my old battery damaged my computer.It fit 100% into my macbook, and being curious I booted my computer up without being plugged in, well prepared to battle the computer into recognizing and reading the new battery.  Surprise surprise, it booted up and functioned entirely normally!I guess if one wanted to complain about the colour being a shade off you could?  But being as this is on the bottom of my computer I could really care less.  My computer case fits just fine over it, and it really is a huge saving for my wallet.  I would definitely recommend getting this over the overly pricey Apple battery replacement.

$REVIEW.: I can't vouch for the Iphone capabilities of these phones (I dare not call them by any modern slang, like cans), but others have written about a rather impressive lineup of features that (microphone input to phone, music pause, etc.) that seem to function very well.The look is either gonna completely turn you off (unless you love white accessories--belts, polo shirts, buckskin shoes--or you have a sense of humor about them; sometimes something can be so blatantly uncool that it becomes hip in its defiance of trends
At any rate, that's how I prefer to think of these.It should be a foregone conclusion that these will be more comfortable and produce better sound than those awful earbud "headphones" that do nothing but fall out of one's ear
Perhaps others like earbuds (EWWW, even sounds like earwigs, the bug) because they stay in their ears and they're certainly lightweight


 These are lighter than some of the non-earbud designs; I found them comfortable and stable

 I happen to like the "old school" two lines descending from the phones; it's consistent with the unconventionality of the look.The sound is very good, not as good as a pair of $80 speakers without all the ipod/iphone interfaces that these have
 You also sacrifice some quality versus the closed ear phones, but that may be a personal preference, and, of course, that would add to the weight


I do think these headphones cost a bit too much at full price, if you can, wait until a sale


 Right now, for example, they're selling at a hefty discount
 Overall, a good, original effort with multi-functionality and decent performance.

$REVIEW.: I've been using Nikon DSLRs since 2004

I've never liked their stock eyecups, especially when wearing my glasses


Over the years, I've purchased many different eyecups, some Nikon, some from aftermarket vendors
I've purchased Hoodman Corporation Hoodeye eyecups in the past and have found them to perform the best of all that I've tried


I just purchased a D3s, so naturally I wanted to replace the stock eyepiece with a new Hoodeye.The main reasons that I like the Hoodeyes are that the material is soft and comfortable to press against your face


A unique feature of the Hoodeye cups that I really like, is the rotation feature

It allows you to quickly and easily change the position of the eyecup from right to left or to the side, when the camera is in the portrait orientation


Lastly, the Hoodeye is easy to install.You need to ascertain which type you need, round or square, before you buy

I have both types and both work equally well.The bottom line is that I've been happy with Hoodeye eyecups since the product came out and they are the only ones that I use on my cameras now.

$REVIEW.: I bought this in Sept 08 and had no problems with my laptop
 It was a plug and play and was recognized without issue
 Recently I noticed that some of the lights hadn't been coming on consistently


 I tried plugging it into another laptop and just thought the lights went bad because it appeared that the connection was still working


 But then again the things it was connected to also had wireless capablility too
 So i wasn't sure
 But today I realized that 4 of the 7 usb ports had stopped working

 So I unplugged it and set it aside to look for my receipt and book that came with it

 I then went to the kensington web page and found the customer service phone number and called it

 My call was answered almost immediately by a very pleasant lady
 She took my info and asked me if I had tried plugging it into another computer and I told her I tried two laptops but if she would hang on i could try my desktop


 Of Course, when I plugged it in there IT WORKED!!!  Isn't that always the case
 I asked her if from time to time it needed to be unplugged to clear and plugged back in

 She said she never really heard that before but if it works then all the better
 So, It is a good product


 It has not had a problem connecting anything I have tried to plug into it, and if by chance you ever notice the lights go out on the front, just try unplugging it for 20 minutes and plugging it back in again

 IT WORKED FOR ME

 The thing I like the best about calling customer service was that (unlike many other manufacturers) I actually got through to a live person, who was pleasant, and very interested in helping me resolve my issue
 because of that GREAT support, I would buy another product from this company.

 I actually have the identical thing in white

 I'd really give it 4 1/2 stars if I could because while it does the job perfectly, it does have a few problems.First, imputing all the phone numbers is a pain


 If you could upload phone numbers from a computer, it would be a big plus in setting it up.Second, when the device is connected, the phones it controls no longer have Caller ID function even if they have the capability for it.Finally, we ended up buying new phones:Panasonic Dect 6.0 Expandable Digital Cordless Phone - 3 Handset System (KX-TG6313S)

 We put the device in line before the phone base and plug both into a jack

 This way it will work for the wireless extension phones which come with the base.However, other phones plugged into jacks are not controlled by the device and will still ring unless the ringer is turned off


 The upside to this is that we turn the ringers on when we want to be sure to hear a call from someone whose phone number we don't know - the cell phone of a repairman for instance.Despite the problems, overall we are very satisfied - it has STOPPED the unwanted phone calls!



$SUMMARY.: It really DOES WORK - with a little tweaking.

$review_text.: I considered getting a USB to HDMI connector so I could watch the internet on my 50" plasma tv, but was told that these VGA to HDMI converters were the better way to go for videos.  Plug in play is true, but you have to know how to configure your windows display settings!!  Connect everything and turn on your computer and tv; then go to display settings.  If you have two monitors show up under display property settings, then you are hooked up correctly.  Check "extend my windows desktop."  Now, change the setting to 640x480, 32 bit color, 60 hz, and your computer background should show up on the tv.  If that setting is not listed, then click on advanced, adapter, list all modes, and it will be listed.  Then you can try to "apply" higher quality settings one at a time; if it's a black tv screen, just revert back to that 640x480.  Now that you have the two monitors in "extended mode," open up a window, and then use your mouse to slide it over to your tv screen.  Wah lah!  I found some tekkie websites that describe how to increase your display setting to my native 1920x1080, but I ran out of energy to attempt it.  With a decent amount of RAM and bandwidth, I am able to watch ESPN3 and Hulu and other videos with decent picture quality.

$review_text.: Nowhere in the description does it say that your sound is disabled when you use it!  Not even the external audio jack.  Also, worked fine with my Panasonic projector and a monitor, but what I purchased it for - to use with my HP mini projector, doesn't work.  I wanted to show stuff on the projector using my Transformer rather than bringing a separate laptop.  Found a HDMI video converter works fine with the mini HDMI to HDMI cable.... Still no sound, but I can project now.

$review_text.: First off, when it works it works fine. It does not work with an external hard drive which is quite annoying. If you plug in an external USB3 HDD it disables the remaining ports (like the HDD draws too much power even though the hub has an external power supply). When it works it's fine with keyboards, mice, external audio devices, etc. But since none of these devices require USB3 speeds it's a waste of money.Secondly, whenever I reboot my Mac the hub will not reset. I have to disconnect the cable from the Mac (or the back of the hub) and reconnect before it will connect to anything plugged into it. Again, very annoying. After I get it to connect it seems to work fine but since I power down my Mac every night and then turn it on the next day it's getting quite irritating that I have to disconnect the hub and then reconnect it when the computer boots up. If it would simply reconnect whenever the computer was rebooted I would give it 4 out of 5 stars (deduct one star because it won't work with external USB hard drives).Update (01-05-13) I received a replacement hub (with return shipping label for the old one) but the new one works exactly as the old one did. Thanks to Sunnie at Laptopmate Customer Support for all the help but this device simply does not work properly with my system. I have a Mac Mini (late model) and an external Seagate 3GB drive. If I unplug the drive before I power up my Mac the hub will usually power up fine (well, about 75% of the time). Then plug in the drive and everything works. I suppose if I simply left my computer on 24/7 I'd never notice. I've heard that the hub and Seagate external do not like each other so maybe this is what is the problem. If I had another drive to test this theory out with I would. But for now (for me anyway) the hub just doesn't work with my setup.

$review_text.: I am glad that after lots of research I finally found something that perfectly suits my requirements.I mostly do landscape photography, so I wanted a tripod that would be small and light weight enough that could be carried wherever needed

I hate using heavy and BIG tripod that are a burden on the shoulders.This tripod is made of light weight aluminum, has a hybrid ball and socket head which can accommodate most cameras and camcorders

It also has a bubble level
Folding and extending is quick too
When fully extended, it reached little over 4 feet.The build quality is excellent and the stability is also good.It costs little more than the competitors like Slick, etc, but then...quality comes at a a price!

$review_text.: The product seems adequately constructed, but it won't let me fire both an SB600 on my Nikon D7000, and simultaneously fire an external strobe via the PC sync socket.I do wedding photography, and want to use the SB600 under iTTL control for main fill, while firing an external strobe with no iTTL control into the background. Dance sessions are typically very dark, so I need both lights to open up the room.If an external strobe is plugged into the hot shoe's PC sync socket, it confuses my D7000 and only a very weak blip of light is emittted by the SB600.An odd and nearly useless design...

$REVIEW.: As someone who has a degenerative eye disease, I have begun to rely more and more on my hearing. I am no audiophile by any means,but I have been listening to music through all kinds of devices for at least 10 years, and in the past 2 I have tried out more than just your average $10-25 drugstore 'phones. I have been looking for the best set around $50(I lose my headphones every 6 months to a year, so I wanted quality that won't break the bank), and my contestants included:Klipsch Image S4LG Tone 730 & 700Brainwavz M2Etymotic Research Mc3 (These were a steal auction find for me at $55, they usually go for around $75)Sound Quality: 9 out of 10As far as sound quality goes, the Brainwavz kicked them ALL out the water. Like I said, I'm no producer, but I've never had a pair of headphones that has the range that these babies will give you. I was literally shocked at the clarity of the overall sound even at low volumes and super high volumes, the balanced, smooth treble, and bass I could really feel. Combine all that, and I felt like Sam Smith was serenading me in person(oh boy, you can bet I was a happy lady). I can say that the bass could be more punchy for Dubstep/House/Rock fans, but it probably would' have been at the cost of less crisp highs and mids. I love all genres and styles however, including my floor-rumbling beats, and I can wholeheartedly say I can deal with the bass level. Classical, Jazz, R&B;, Country, and the rest of the more articulate genres sound crystal clear- I can hear notes that you've never heard before in old songs I always listen to! The Etymotics are comparable in sound quality, but the rest don't even come close.Aesthetics/Usability: 10 out of 10Sure, some people don't mind walking around with plastic bulbs, squares or neon-colored ear-hugging style headphones; but I want to look decent while wearing mine, and these are headphones that I -Want- to show off. The Klipsch headphones are comparable, but the Brainwavz M2 headphones have an all metal casing that really outshines the rest; you can tell that whoever made this put a lot of thought into the overall design. The LG Tone is a bluetooth headset and has a futuristic look that is very taste-specific (you either like it or you don't) that isn't very functional for exercise, as it bounces around your neck during high activity. Don't even get me started on the wonky design of the Etymotics. Heck, even the case for the Brainwavz is flashy! In the end, they look like they cost more than I paid for them.Quality/Durability: 8.5 out of 10I have only had these headphones for a week and will update this review as time passes, but they are definitely made of sturdier materials than the Klipsch and LG Tone headphones. The Etymotics are basically bulletprroof, so it didn't win over those, but only time will tell how these hold up. The braided cord is the highest quality I've seen and is truly tangle resistant as long as you coil it firmly around three fingers before storage as the instructions state. I am slightly concerned as one of the black rubber-type covers on the connection between the headphone and the cord slipped off and I had to slide it back on, but it seems to be more of an aesthetic fault than a possible mechanical issue. I don't see these headphones standing up to being coated in sweat, washed in the washing machine, or swung onto a granite counter-top, but as a person who is careful and doesn't sweat a lot this isn't much of an issue for me.Bottom Line: These headphones make losing my eyesight not seem so bad anymore. Try them out.

$REVIEW.: The player does fine with BluRay discs and it provides a useful and fairly efficient connection to NetFlix

So, it met my basic expectations


What was a surprise, however, is the usefulness of other links to Pandora, YouTube, and computers on our home network

 Being able to play music from Pandora on a decent sound system is an unexpected benefit, as is the ability to play good-quality YouTube videos on a larger screen
Perhaps the greatest unexpected benefit is the ability to play HD videos recorded on our camcorder and stored on our computers

 This is a significantly easier and more efficient way to play these files compared to connecting a laptop to the TV, etc.Buyers who are considering the purchase of a WiFi-connected BluRay player should be aware that a wired connection is likely to provide a faster and more reliable connection

In comparing wired and WiFi connections for this player, I experience more buffering delays with video services and generally slower network connections

As a result, I use a wired connection.The only other performance issue I have experienced involves the Nero MediaHome software provided with the player
This creates a media server that provides access to files on computers on your home network
I am able to connect to computers on our network, but the manual contains only minimal instructions for installing and configuring the software
Lacking any guidance, I am reluctant to attempt to optimize it.UPDATE: After users experienced problems, LG had to withdraw an update released in April 2011


This is one case in which the frustrating firmware updating process was beneficial because the update failed repeatedly (which seems typical of all updates I have performed)

As a result, I avoided the hassle of having to revert to an earlier version of the software

Unfortunately, the web site has not been helpful in notifying users of the problemmatic update or the availability of new software that is valid.As other reviewers have noted, LG telephone support is usually helpful, but the web-based support instructions are confusing and disjointed, due in part to broken English

An investment in better quality online material would deflect calls to the support center and reduce the frustration of owners of this LG product.FURTHER UPDATE:  The most recent firmware update went more smoothly than any previous attempt

I'm not sure if LG modified its updating process or if this was simply an unusual instance; regardless, it was completed very quickly and smoothly.

$REVIEW.: I bought this for my mom, therefore I just spent a few hours teaching her to rip cds, and sync music.I have owned three iPods (a nano, a video, and an original one).  This is a more feature-packed device than any of my ipods.  For many, it will be a better choice.Features:Zen beats iPod in the features department.  The screen is better than the one on the new Nano (same resolution, but larger).  The display eye-candy factor is better.  It includes a very good recorder and a strong FM tuner, which are missing completely in the ipod.Accessoies:The zen doesn't even offer a dock.  iPod kills zen in the useful accessories competition.  You can get any imaginable accessory for iPod.  If you want a player to do more than drive your headphones, don't get the zen.Ease of use:Ipod gains an edge here.  Both are easy, but ipod is easier.  Ipod will probably always win this battle because itunes is very good software.  Podcast options in itunes are easier.  Options like picking playlists and videos are easier in itunes.  The itunes store is far superior (although I prefer to buy most music on discs).  I had a couple crashes when initially setting up the zen due to conflicts with WMP trying to access the player at the same time as the Creative update software.  I had to soft reset the device twice while messing around with it.  This kind of thing doesn't happen with iPods because iTunes does it all, and it is designed for iPod.  Zen relies on compatibility with WMP, which is not Creative brand software.  Because I bought this as a gift for an older person (my mom is almost 60), if I made the purchase again I would buy the ipod nano.Form factor / controls:Ipod has a slight edge here too.  The click wheel is a lot easier to use than the 5-way nav + play button + menu button + up button on the zen.  Ipod is slightly more pocketable.  The zen is quite a bit larger, but both are so tiny and pocketable that it hardly makes a difference.Price:Zen is widely available for about 25% less than the iPod.Conclusion:If you want a super-easy to use, super slick device: iPod is the best choice.  If you are less tech savy and computer software drives you nuts, ipod wins again.  If you want a richly featured device and are willing to put up with slightly awkward desktop software, the Zen is the way to go.  If I buy another player, I think this one would win for me because the FM radio and recorder would be very useful, and I am patient with computer hickups.  As a gift for my mom, I wish I had bought her the iPod.

$REVIEW.: At the same time I purchased a Studio 1745 Laptop six months ago, I ordered a Targus bundle which included a plastic two fan cooling pad.  Until just recently I had no complaints with the Targus bundle of products.  Now the fans on the cooling pad make a terrible noise which can only be stopped by lifting the cooling pad and letting it fall on my workspace.  As someone in another review said, rather than an obstruction in the cooling fans, the weight of the laptop became a issue and made the fans produce a grinding noise which even today, I could not resolve.After so many rave reviews, I ordered the XPad Slim Cooling Pad that fits up to 17" laptops and after only an hour, I could hardly wait to write a review on this product.  My laptop stays on my desk, so I didn't rate the durability but all other areas get a five-star rating.  No cords, no noisey fans, an extra USB port, it is a perfect size for my 17" laptop, and it keeps my laptop cool!On top of an excellent product that resolved so many undesirable issues, it was packaged well, and I received the order in what seemed like a flash delivery!

$review_text.: Like many here, I've owned them all.  Our family has several Garmin and Magellan units, as well as Google nav on my android phone. Have also had some good and bad Nav systems built into some cars we've had. Each implementation leaves something to be desired, and most get the job done.  This is my first TomTom.As with all software driven devices, unless something is totally ridiculous, I try to get my head into how the developers laid out their menus, commands, controls, interface, etc.  Personally, over the years, I found myself reaching for the Magellan unit more often than the Garmin, as I liked its software better (which translates to I get less lost!)I travel quite a bit for business, and really depend on the GPS.  I won't discuss all the various customization options here, because frankly, I don't care. I don't over customize anything I have, because it usually makes things harder to diagnose, update, and even use sometimes, so I usually leave all my gadgets pretty close to how they ship, unless there's something that is clearly better than factory settings.My basic impressions of the TomTom 1505M are the following:Package and physical device:  Very nice, compact design.  Extremely lightweight, large clear screen, and a wonderful built in mount.  The On/Off switch is in a somewhat odd place (rear inside corner), but I can get used to it.  Also, I do like the power cord connector being in the rear and embedded, this way it doesn't stick out all the time and risk being broken.Software:  Simple and the fundamentals are right there.  Large simple buttons, and not too many distracting options are presented when you first start it.  Personally, I don't really care for the "easy to use" nomenclature like "go to".  I would prefer something like "enter address", but it doesn't matter once you get used to it.  Lots of software designers are doing these silly arbitrary humanisms that are generally confusing.Maps:  They seem fine to me, and I'm not a connoisseur as many profess themselves to be.  It finds the addresses I need, and generally gets me there.Using it:  First of all, I will not judge the unit on whether it finds a good way to go or not.  Folks that criticize GPS systems because it doesn't go the way they prefer, should get a life.  These things are computers that calculate routes with data.  They have no idea what people's likes or dislikes are.When using these units, the only things I care about are clarity of directions, enough early warning for turns, and fast enough recalculations when I miss a turn.  The TomTom 1050M is ok at clarity of directions, and is not much different than most.  Early warning for turns are ok too, however, it doesn't beep or bong when you're on the turn, so I do find myself missing turns more often than with other GPS systems.  It could be a set up thing, that I haven't found yet though.  As far as recalculations, its slow.  Not annoyingly slow, but slow enough to be aggravating when you're in totally unknown territory.I do find that the unit is pretty good when you first turn it on and initialize a trip.  It generally gets the starting point and direction you're facing right.  This was a frustrating thing about the Magellan, where it would be lost for the first 5 minutes, and I'd make 90 u turns until it got its head together.  The TomTom is good at that.Conclusion:  This unit has quite a bit to like about it.  I haven't tried any updates yet, or done much customization.  It suits me well for getting me around.  The screen is large, the buttons require a bit of pressure to get them to go, which is good in my view.  The integrated mount is great, as is the power supply.  Recalc time is not amazing, and the turn indicator is non existent, but so far, I like the unit.Update 5/17/2011After taking more trips with this unit, I have a few more supplemental observations.  First, its recalculation speed when you miss a turn is very fast. And you'll need it because it often doesn't lead you to the turn as gracefully as it could. I'm not sure if ANY GPS is great at this, especially in congested urban areas like Boston or NY.  But this unit's recalc speed is really really good.I also find that it is inconsistent at first startup.  Sometimes it finds satellites quickly, and sometimes it sits there like a useless piece of silicon lost in the ether of the universe.Update 5/27/2011Have used the TomTom 1505M on numerous trips now.  The recalc speed continues to impress me, and you will continue to need it as I miss most of the turns it tells me to take.  It is either late, or imprecise as to when you are supposed to turn.  Sometimes it will still be a 250Ft away when you are right at the turn, otherwise, it starts telling you to turn when you've passed the turn.I still like the large clear buttons.  I've had a couple of instances lately where it simply would NOT find the satellites, which is irritating..  In 1 instance, I simply put the address in and it all of a sudden knew where it was.  The other time, I had to power cycle it to have it get its act together.  I've had several instances where I had used it in California, then returned to the East Coast, and the thing was simply lost and had no idea where it was.  Yo GPS, find the silly satellites, that's what you're supposed to do!
$SUMMARY.: Nice unit, great interface, simple mount and lightweight

If your into overkill products this is the motherboard for you, easily overclocked my i7 3770K to 4.5 GHz on first attempt while using iGPU on air cooling. Got it, plugged it in and worked like it was supposed to, zero issues with this motherboard after two months.If you want the best Z77 motherboard this one has it all, this is the king of Z77! All memory dimm's work without issue, doesn't even really mater which you use for module #1 and #2, red or black it doesn't matter. BIOS is where this board really shines, not much effort to overclock processor.Pay attention to where the SATA III 6Gbps ports are on board for Intel's controller, I made the mistake of instead using the third part SATA III 6Gbps ports. If using an SSD disable S.M.A.R.T. and make sure SATA is configured for AHCI! Lots of useful software included like the ROG Desktop themes, ROG CPU-Z.

If you don't already own an iPod but is thinking of getting one along with this iFM Radio, consider this:Cost of iPod+FM = $145+$36=$181Cost of Sansa  = $107The Sandisk (or even the Zen or the new Samsung) has many more features (MP3 player, Photo viewer, Video player, Voice recorder, FM Radio and MicroSD memory expansion slot) for much less money. I must admit, the iPod is definitely more sexy and more user friendly.  I just wish Apple wouldn't get too greedy and instead integrate the FM Radio feature in the next release of iPods.

$review_text.: I have to agree with Carl Scharenberg's review!After searching for the "perfect" hub, I found it here. I mounted it under the shelf above my laptop and it looks real good. The only thing I am wondering is why they sent tiny machine screws to use for mounting. I used a couple of countersunk wood screws instead.I plugged in the power supply, and the cool blue light came on. Next I shut down my Dell Latitude D531 laptop and plugged in all of the USB cables that run my CanoScan scanner, Seagate 250 gig external harddrive, wireless mouse, external CD/RW drive, HP laser printer, ThinkPad laptop (it shares my printer), 35-in-1 digital camera card reader, and my USB Powered and Most Efficient Aluminium Cooler Pad. With everything plugged in, I still have one port left empty for future use. You can also piggy-back another hub if you need more ports.I turned on the Dell, and it found all of the "new" peripherials in about 45 seconds. This hub is truly plug & play. It's very well designed, and works flawlessly. You won't find a better one.

$REVIEW.: We purchased this camera to update our existing Canon S2IS just before our first trip to Israel. Overall, this camera was excellent and consistently took great pictures. I shot about 1,300 pictures, some under very challenging conistions. The menus and operation were somewhat similar to our old S2IS so there was very little learning curve.Modes used: I shot most pictures using the "P" mode which allows some manual settings such as ISO, white balance, flash strength, and exposure adjustment. The remainder I shot in manual mode.What I liked: The old S2IS often took a long time to lock focus. This camera focuses very quickly allowing me to get a lot of "just now" shots. The image stabilizer, like the one in the S2IS was phenominal. With still subjects, I could consistently get clean, well focused shots at 1/8 second, and I have a slight hand tremor. Sometimes I could get good shots at slower shutter speeds. This really helped indoors where flashes were not permitted, or the subjects were distant. It also helped a lot at night. Another huge feature is the range of the lens. It goes from slightly telephoto at 28mm to 560 mm (20X zoom). I was able to get shots of things I could hardly see with my naked eye. I was also able to get close ups at great distance. Many of my best shots were at high zoom. With dslr's you often have to change lenses and these shots would have been missed. The manual settings were generally easy to use and really expanded the pictures we could shoot. Generally, I used shutter priority. I really liked the electronic viewfinder. It saves battery power and accurately shows how a shot will be exposed. It also has a diopter adjustment. The flip out and twist tilt screen was also a help with crowd shots. The flash was strong and can be enhanced.  In addition, there is a "hot shoe" for an add on flash. I did not have an add on flash, but I can see how it would be useful in lower light conditions. I discovered there is a "mute" button on the top left that suppresses all noise. This is handy when you can't be obtrusive. To turn sounds back on, you have to go into the menu. Battery life was also very good. I used rechargable nmh batteries that when fully charged would handle the almost 200 shots per day without indicating much use on the battery level indicator. Overall the camera provided well focused and well exposed shots in a variety of conditions, with plenty of adjustments and clever features.What could be better: Occasionally the autofocus would be fooled in low light or with objects intervening between me and the subject. I would revert to the manual focus mode, but it was a little awkward to use. In shutter priority mode, you spin a wheel on the back of the camera to adjust shutter speed. The change in shutter speed did not respond predictably to my thumbing of the wheel. Not a major problem, but I noticed it. In cloudy lighting (much of our trip in December) some shots were a bit overexposed in "P" mode inducing me to use shutter priority. To be fair the shots would often consist of brighter sky, and darker buildings. The camera does have several exposure algorithms to choose, but I stayed with the default. And since this is a point and shoot, and not a dslr, shooting at higher ISO's resulted in somewhat grainy pictures. The highest ISO I used was 800, sometimes at night and sometimes in caves so the "noise" was not all that relevant to the picture quality.I gave the camera 4 stars because it was excellent, but not perfect.Update June 17, 2009: I have happily used this camera for family and school events since my last review and I am very pleased. I also shot an Ultimate Frisbee tournament that my son participated in and was held indoors. With indoor lighting, I was not able to capture very many good shots, even when overiding shutter speed settings and shooting at 800 ISO. I ended up taking most of the pictures using a dSLR from my son's school newspaper.  There was a world of difference in quality.  The better sensor of the dSLR was able to handle the lower light with no problem.  I am still very pleased with the SX10IS, its fine overall picture quality, and many features, but recognize the limitations of its point and shoot sensor.

$review_text.: The Dolbe True-HD decoding looks nice, although it's already built-in for PS3, so the capability is redundant if you use it for BluRay.The number of HD capable inputs look thin. Even though there are 2 HDMI in and 3 components in, the 2 HDMI and 2 of the components are duplicates for the same inputs, so it really only has 3 HD capable inputs.With a HD cable or Sat box, XBox 360, PS3, it's already maxed out. If you want to add something like an Apple TV, or another HD cable or Sat box or DVR, or even if you want to hook up a Wii through component to take advantage of 16:9 wide screen, you don't have enough inputs. This is lacking compared to the Sony STR-DG910 which can handle up to 4 HD inputs at the same time.

$REVIEW.: The SanDisk Memory Vault is pricey at nearly $50 for 8 GB but the flash drive is supposed to retain these photos and their quality for 100 years while the usual lifespan on a flash drive is supposed to be 10 years
 As other reviewers have pointed out, very few of us will able to check if the photos do last 100 years since the technology will likely have changed by then.On the other hand, SanDisk offers a limited warranty that the Memory Vault will be able to retain the photos for 100 years
 SanDisk has tested the Memory Vault through "temperature cycling" to simulate how the photos and flash drive would behave over time.While it's hard to tell whether the Memory Vault will live up to the 100 year promise, it might be worth using for those photos that you are particularly fond of

 I've chosen my favorites and  moved them to the Memory Vault in the hope that they'll retain their quality
It's another level of protection.

$REVIEW.: Everything worked great as soon as connected. I had been looking for a way to send IR signals between rooms over extra coax runs that were already in place.  Wireless wasn't reliable and trying to use other wiring was too complicated.  I now have two IR receivers controlling the TV cable box in a third room over this separate, "retired" RG59 coax (all my video runs over RG6).  Just be sure to use DC passing splitters with this system.  I was amazed at how easy this was, and am very happy with the performance. I may be expanding soon...A MONTH LATER: I had a failure, which I reported to Amazon. Tom called as the seller's rep and spent two hours helping me troubleshoot. It appears that the injector went bad (replaced immediately), but during the evaluation, I apparently caused a short or shock that killed the "bug" which glues to the cable box.  Not checking the bug cost me a lot of extra time.  These parts may be quite sensitive, so I recommend disconnecting the injector's power plug before changing any connections.  Tom also said to use the correct size splitter, as any open DC-passing ports on the splitter can cause signal interfetence.  I'm as happy as ever, but will treat this kit as very delicate if I have to make any changes.  The end result is exactly what I wanted, and the seller is clearly committed to customer satisfaction.

$REVIEW.: It is a good cheap case.  However, my biggest grip is that the buckle is under the flap.  This creates two issues that makes me wish I bought something else:  1) since the buckle is inside and under the flap, the flap will stick out a bit when I am carrying it by the handle.  The buckle is carrying the weight of the bag. and 2) if the bag becomes thicker (e.g. putting in your rolled up laptop cord/power brick)the flap will stick out too.  If it is just the laptop and just papers then it is fine.  But when you start to add a little weight or a little thickness, it just looks weird.For the money, it works and the quality is good.  I'd say it is good for papers, thin books and folders, etc.  It works overall to store my laptop.  But if I want something to look a bit professional, I'd look for something else.Edit:The inner lining of the front outer pocket ripped from the bottom.  I can see the foam underneath it.  While this was just the internal of the pouch, the bag is still usable.  But I decided to purchase another bag for my laptop and will only be using this for books and papers.

$REVIEW.: First, want to say that AMAZON customer service is amazing!  After a hour on the phone with Verizon Broadband making sure that my USB modem & software was working correctly (which it was), tried to contact Asus to find out if there was some other reason I couldn't connect to the internet. Called Asus twice, between 7:15 am and again at 7:30.  Sat on hold for over 25 minutes the last time.  Went to ASUS website-also no luck with this problem.  Finally called Amazon.  The rep called Asus for me (and stayed on the line).  The Asus person was essentially useless.  She would ask me a question, I'd answer, and she would ask the EXACT question again.  Finally she mumbled something about maybe it isn't compatible and HUNG UP ON ME & AMAZON!  At that point, Amazon agreed to let me return the unit...I think they were as frustrated as I was at that point.So, I only kept the unit long enough to charge the battery and fight with the internet connection problem..but here are my impressions.This is not a netbook that you can throw in your purse...it's fairly heavy with the battery installed. A trade-off for the long battery life.I was excited about the white color option, as Apple hardware is so gorgeous in white.  Not so much the Asus. It's fairly drab looking, which surprised me.  If it had worked well, would have kept it, obviously, but have to say its appearance was disappointing. Should have made the frame surrounding the screen white too, I think.The keyboard was comfortable.  If you don't need Broadband connectivity, or care about the weight, you'll be happy with the Asus...but buy the BLUE one instead...

Not only have these brough sanity back to me from removing the construction noise, but the background office noises are gone as well.These things are very comfortable to wear all day, and I am able to keep my music a lower level than I normally would for my office.I would highly recommend these to anyone.

$REVIEW.: I wouldn't wait to get this till you need to replace your speakers if you have an old car (2000 or older)
your speakers probably have small magnets with stiff paper cones and thin surrounds


saugy cone = saugy sound


This speaker has a good sized magnet, plastic cone, and dense foam surround


It will keep up with any stock 6X9 speaker in a 2013 vehicle.

$REVIEW.: I recently got a Paperwhite Kindle (PW) and then got this case for it.  I wanted something light and non obtrusive.  I have a Kindle KB and have several cases for it including the Amazon with built in light.This case is the best of the group in terms of functionality and use. It fits the Paperwhite well with no interference.  My first impression when I received it was how light it was - also does not add much to the overall dimensions,The cover is quite protective, and the sides of the PW are protected by the surrounding mounting yet open at the bottom if you need to either plug in the charging cord or use the switch.  The magnetic latch that acts to keep it closed is a bonus, both in it's simplicity and it also turns on/off the PW.  Nice to grab it, read, and then just close the cover.  I have noticed that it does stay on some times (peaking in the side opening in the dark) but not always.  Always turns it on.  (you do have to swipe it to get past the splash screen).  The top cover folds back easily and does not need a strap to keep it there - another plus.For traveling, I do put it into a CaseCrown small pouch - this also accommodates the charging cord, business cards, pen, and some paper for notes in it's separate pocket.Very happy with the purchase.  Recommended!

$review_text.: Shipping was good, ordered Sat morning, received Wed by mail.At first the plug wouldn't attach to the tablet, the magnets felt too weak


Then I saw that the magnets weren't in line with each other, like the plug was twisted in two dimensions


I really didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it and waiting on a replacement so I gave it a gentle twist to put the magnets in line with each other, and it worked!The plug now connects properly and charging seems a bit faster than with the micro-USB plug.Remember that this is only a charging cord, it doesn't include the actual charger, and the cable is only 4 ft long
For $20 it should include the charger and the cable should be 1 or 2 feet longer, but this is the first (and so far only) such cable available

If you want to wait for more choices in the market the price will drop, and maybe the selection will improve.

The older version was so slow and I had to be lucky to get a good shot even though the zoom was good. This one is SO MUCH better! I can go fast shot to shot or continuous without losing my subject ( surfer ) on the wave so I can shoot more. Not great in low light, but I LOVE that it has a &#34;eyeball viewfinder&#34; which is a huge plus in bright light!Also the battery lasts a long time!

$review_text.: This is the perfect little tool for that hard drive recovery you need to do, and it has other functions as well.What you get:-USB to IDE interface. It even has plugs for both regular and laptop (3.5 or 2.5) drives.-Power cables, with adapters to suit any drive.-SATA plugs, so you can even rescue CD or DVD drives as well as hard disks.How easy is it to use? I was recovering a laptop hard drive. I just slapped on the USB adapter, plugged it in to a free USB slot on my computer (running Vista), and it worked. No muss, no fuss. Your experience might not be quite so smooth- you might actually have to plug in one or two more things if you drive needs power- but you get the idea. Ridiculously simple and straightforward for any drive.If what you want is a quick way to recover a hard drive, or a universal kit you can keep on hand to quickly set up any hard drive or CD/DVD drive you might encounter, you've found the perfect product. Simple to use, with sturdy construction, and it's reasonably priced. The cables even have decent reach, so hookup is always simple.A lot of people complain that this package is a mess of wires. This product clearly is what it is- a rescue / recovery package for drives. The hardware is built tough so you could leave it plugged in permanently if you wanted, but if you want a permanent installation, get a real IDE cable and get your drive plugged in right. This is a perfect little "field kit" for rescuing drives, no more no less.

$review_text.: Sound quality is awesome on the 730 and are very comfortable to wear at the gym/office. The #1 reason I bought the LG HBS-730 is the long battery life (10 hrs music, 15 hrs talk, and 15 DAYS standby). A competitor (Plantronix) has one with shorter battery life but auto-hibernation if it didn't sense your mobile device. Wish the 730 had auto-hibernate but oh well...Been reading reviews complaining the 730 does not have a long range compared to 700. I just bought the 730 to use with my Samsung Galaxy 4 phone and I can go about 50 ft before the audio starts cutting out. So yes, I suppose if you have an older phone that doesn't support Bluetooth 3.0 then your distance may not be as good with the 730. The 700 uses older Bluetooth technology which explains why the sound poor sound quality. Newer phones should work great with the 730. LG should post a disclaimer on the box so people know what to expect.Couple improvements would make this a 5 star review.1. Auto-shutoff if no Bluetooth signal established. The external power button can easily be bumped into the on position and drain the battery so be careful. Even better option is auto-shutoff if the ear buds are docked back into the holders.2. The shiny black plastic housing is a little to slick and slippery for my taste. A matted or rubber feel would of been better.

Pics & description on those 2 said "Auto Sleep Timer" and showed a "Sleep" button---but when I did receive them, both did not even mention the sleep function or have the button per the pic!This one (the Phillips) did meet my needs to turn off my Bedroom TV so that I could drift off to sleep, and allowing for either the TV sleep function if built in, or a universal timed power off when pointed toward the TV for 1-99 mins.The "Input" & "Menu" functions worked just as my OEM, and so was a full replacement for the TV.  Havnt used for other devices since dont need (use an RF Sat remote for DTV Recvr/DVR located in my living room).

$REVIEW.: Logitech Harmony Ultimate One IR Remote with Customizable Touch Screen Control (915-000224)Logitech finally came up with a replacement for the supremely popular Harmony One remote. It is called the Ultimate One and it is essentially the Ultimate without the RF kit. It is exactly that because in the software there is an upgrade offer to sell you the RF puck and cables to transform this to the Ultimate. It adds the missing features like controlling devices in a cabinet and setting up smart devices, like an iPhone, to act as remotes. It&#8217;s a good way to start out slow and add features if you need them. The upgrade is one hundred dollars, the same difference between the Ultimate and Ultimate One so it&#8217;s a reasonable way to expand it.The hand feel of the remote is good. It isn&#8217;t too heavy and it&#8217;s smaller than the remotes that preceded it. The touch screen is larger than earlier models and there are fewer hard keys than before too. I do miss some easy to use keys over the touch screen but I&#8217;m getting used to the overall use. The screen visual quality is good but because of the layout Favorite icons are smaller than before and they suffer in terms of resolution. Overall the screen is easy to see and the hard buttons are all backlit for easy seeing in the dark. The lights all go dim by a user settable timer. The afore mentioned icons can be used to set up 50 favorite channels for ONE provider. This is the biggest shortcoming for the current line-up of Harmony remotes. Previously you were able to set up multiple carriers, such as Time Warner Cable and Over The Air and have sets of icons for each one. That ended with the new software and new remotes. Tech support says they are considering a change but as of this writing, it&#8217;s as it is. There have been numerous updates and feature enhancements for the Ultimate remote and the U1 takes advantage of them. Among the updates was the addition of a sleep timer in the remote so you can shut off the activity you are watching while falling asleep. They also added the ability to add custom backgrounds, in addition to the included set. A good source for custom icons and soon, backgrounds is iconharmony dot com.  Using these custom graphics really helps to personalize your remote.My one main nit to pick with the hardware is the choice to seal in the battery. On previous remotes Logitech had issues with the battery pack expanding and they wound up replacing many remotes. I don&#8217;t think the solution to use a custom sealed in battery is a good choice. When the battery dies you will have to mail in the remote to them or a service center. Not a great solution in my opinion.You program the remote with a website app at myharmony dot com. On the forum they recently announced a new software offline solution is being rolled out. This was how it used to be and many are happy it is coming back. This is a very good but not perfect and certainly not an &#8220;Ultimate&#8221; remote. I do like it and have grown used to it, including using its brother The Ultimate, and I do like it. If I was designing it I&#8217;d have used a much higher resolution screen and used standard rechargeable, replaceable batteries. So I&#8217;m deducting one star but still recommend it for its usability with the vast amount of systems.

FYI, this is rather large and bulky and when you mount the base with its included double-sided tape it is on you scope permanently! Luckily, you can purchase additional bases to allow you to use on more than one scope. You can also purchase one and two inch riser bases to allow it to fit on your scope without taking your other finder scope off. One warning--take the Telrad off your scope before viewing the Sun or you will burn the reticule! This finder is worth the cost.

$REVIEW.: With this 1GB drive you never need burn a CD-Rom again.  Why bother? This holds 50% more than a standard CD, and it doesn't require you to have a CD burner or a blank CD lying around.I've found that this drive really hits the right balance of size and cost.  It is big enough to do most jobs, and it is small enough that if you had to replace it, it would not be a big deal.  I often use it to move Powerpoint presentations from one computer to another, or to transfer music or video.Haven't used one before? You pull off the cap and plug the drive directly into your computer's USB port. (You don't need any software or drivers to preload - just plug it in to any computer.) When it is plugged in the computer automatically recognizes it as a new drive right on your desktop. I.e. Go to your "My Computer" section and it now shows up as a new drive.  You then treat it like you would any other drive -you can just drag and drop files to it.One final note: the place where a line attaches is on the drive body itself, and not the cap.  This is good because if you attach it to something it won't slide out of the cap leaving you with an empty cap tied to your neck (or keychain) with no drive...And finally, I think this is a great present for non-techies.  My parents have finally become converts and they use this all the time.

$review_text.: This is a decent radio and not too expensive at the $19.99 price point.AM performance is good and that's a basic feature that you need for a radio to take on a camping trip, for example. FM is good too, but it's not stereo. Shortwave is also pretty good even though there are images and whistles like any low end single-conversion model.I found the controls solid and the radio well made and fit. The tuning dial is easy to read, but no dial light. The side-mounted off-on switch is unlikely to activate by accident. Unlike many small radios, this one doesn't fall over easily. It runs on two AA batteries with good battery life.There's really not much in the way of complexity and most folks should be able to operate the radio without looking at the manual.If you want to take up shortwave listening as a hobby, a beginner might do better with a radio having a digital tuning readout, something like aTECSUN PL-380 DSP FM stereo.

I had a little snag with some AUX cables that were very tight fitting, causing me to believe they were plugged in when they were not.

$review_text.: This product gives you an Apple TV sort of iPad mirroring for Android devices.  I purchased this to mirror my Kindle Fire HDX (which has a very high definition screen) and after a bit of fiddling (I had to load the latest update to get the HDX to mirror) had it working. For those who don't know, this essentially provides the sort of display mirroring on a TV that you get with Apple TV and the iPad, but without the content limitations. It works flawlessly, and I have been using this more than my Roku3 to watch movies, YouTube, etc. The X-ray feature on Amazon Videos is nice (essentially access to IMDB database while watching a movie) works well, and is actually quite useful.

$REVIEW.: There's really not too much that goes into making a nice carrying case. Unfortunately a lot of companies find ways to mess it up. Lowepro manages to create a nice, affordable carrying case for your GPS.The carabiner is a really nice touch. It fits nicely on my belt for GPS on the go. You obviously don't need to use the carabiner all the time but it's nice to have.The case is soft yet still manages to protect the contents. My only complaint is that the battery pouch is pretty small. You're probably not going to spend a lot of time trying to find a GPS case but Lowepro offers a great product at a great price.

Try not to use the trace they provide for markings
Measure twice and do it with a level

I agree that the instructions are ikea style (all with pictures)


May be because Samsung sells all over the world and was saving paper to print the instructions in multiple languages (just my hunch).The product's design was well thought through and comes with all the extensions needed


Use bolt screws instead of the ones provided and you will be good
I wish they had one for TV's higher than 65 inches.

This drive looks great and is solidly built.This is the fifth WD drive I've gotten and I've never had any problems with any of them. (One of them is even a refurbished drive I bought directly from WD and it works great, too.) I love these plug-and-play drives that are powered via the hookup rather than an external plug. They're very easy to remove and store in your laptop bag.The all-metal design no doubt costs more to manufacture than the plastic casing that comes with the Windows-based model, but still. I'd give this five stars if the price were a little closer to the PC-model price.

The buttons are well spaced out and the shortcut buttons for music/video are useful. Another thing that I like about the buttons is that they aren't raised extremely high like some keyboards I've used in the past, which really helps prevent typos. Only negative point for me would have to be that it's wired, but for the price I really can't complain. Good Buy!This is a Social Writeup

$review_text.: Was looking for a case for my Motorola HD Vehicle Navigation Dock for Motorola DROID RAZR HD/RAZR MAXX HD. This case Does fit inside the dock. I'm very happy I don't have to take the case off to put it in the dock.It is not quite as grippy as the Kevlar(looking) back of the stock case due to the hard plastic cover, but the sides have just enough texture to help hold.It adds girth to the phone, but not nearly what I expected. I was thinking of something huge, and when I put the case on, I was pleasantly surprised.HD and USB ports are not protected, but I didn't want them to be so It would fit my dock correctly.Hard plastic shell wraps around all 4 corners, but nothing on the top or bottom. Not an issue.Buttons line up fine, I've even tried to twist the cover to get them to not line up, and the buttons still work correctly.This case also keeps the look and feel of the razr hd. I really liked the squared off shape of the HD, and this case kept that look.Extra: screen protector is a cheapie added in to the box. I'll keep it on until its scratched and replace with a ZAGG MOTDRORAZRHDS invisibleSHIELD.Overall exactly what I was looking for.

$REVIEW.: These Kodak batteries, I originally bought for a cordless phone that was mis-advertised as having replaceable AAA recharageable batteries, couldn't use them at the time of purchase, but found a use for them later.They make great batteries for those small LED flashlights that requires 3 AAA batteries & mice that requires 2. Charge lasts a long time, they've only been ran dead once, that was when I left the flashlight upside down & turned on. Found it 2 weeks later.However, the batteries recharged right up in 8-9 hours & still holds a long charge.At the price (less than a 4 pack of &#34;premium brand&#34; extra life batteries), I can't complain at all. However keep in mind that Kodak has officially gone out of business, so if they're still for sale, research when they were last manufactured. The package on mine states 2009 (just checked), so I consider myself lucky they're 5 years old & still going, especially after a total drain.Cat

$review_text.: I purchased this for my Dell Latitude 10 which it was supposed to be designed for. The tablet fits inside the slot however that's about it. The cover blocks both the left and right side of the tablets screen, so you cannot swipe either side, which is basically how you get around the Windows menus. Also not that I was going to use it much, if you have the Latitude 10 that has a flash, the camera hole blocks it, although there is an opening for the camera. The speaker openings could be better as well, it's partially blocked. Most of the other slots are open but the HDMI slot is covered. Poetic should have had an actual tablet to fit it with and test it with, apparently this was not the case, no pun intended.

Therefore, we wanted a keyed lock since these would be checked in & out by employees (regular travelers have nicer combo locks). Given our parameters, this works pretty well. It's a great theft deterrent (it's a sturdy lock). The metal/plastic piece going into the laptop slot wiggles around in the kengsington slot, but I think it's actually sturdier than it seems. These are easy to operate and come with a pouch. It will definitely work against a casual thief.

$review_text.: ***6/5/08 Changing the rating of this camera to THREE stars. CCD began to fail about 3 months ago...blacking out the LCD for a short time, then snapping back on...then total failure. Looked online, found a huge thread of Powershot A610 users that had the same issue. Canon has replaced some for free, but more often it's generally it's a major effort to receive satisfaction (a free repair). Sending mine in tomorrow, will update on their resolution.Bought this to replace an older 3mp Canon that my wife loved, but the battery  (and subsequent replacements) were awful.  They'd last perhaps 10-20 pictures and then start flashing "low-battery".So I started hunting down a camera that used AA-type and settled on the A610.Great camera and features. We rarely print bigger then 5x7, so the 5mp was perfect. If you want the higher resolution A620, they're identical cameras with the 7mp chip.With fully loaded batteries, we get hundreds of shots and only recharge perhaps one every 3-4 weeks...and my wife is taking pics of the kids constantly.

$review_text.: This is with out a doubt the best laptop that can be had at this price range. If not because it sports the latest Ivy-Bridge, amazing unibody design, USB 3.0, Thunderbolt, and many other cool features, then simply for the damn trackpad. I'm serious, go into an electronics store, and try out the trackpads on other ultrabooks and you will be immediately struck with the feeling of amazement on how such a simple part of a computer can make or break an immersive experience. And Mountain Lion takes full advantage of this wonderful trackpad. Sure, OSX does take a bit to learn when switching from a Windows OS, but in the end it honestly is more efficient at doing the things you love doing (surfing, writing e-mails, watching videos etc.)Overall this is a superb laptop. It may seem expensive at first, but Macs last so long, and they are built with such attention-to-detail that it makes the couple extra hundred bucks worth it. And yes, Macs used to be overpriced, but with this Macbook Air, that "Apple Tax" is dwindling ever more rapidly. You won't be disappointed!

$REVIEW.: I got this free with a promotion.  It's nice looking and will fit nicely in my camera bag.  It was free because I bought a 4 GB SanDisk Ultra II CompactFlash card rated at 15 MB/s.  I did some testing and found that it maxed out at 4.5 MB/s, regardless of which flash card I used.Using a SanDisk CompactFlast to USB adaptor, the CD card I bought clocked in at 14 MB/s and an older card rated at 30 MB/s clocked in at 17 MB/s.  So it appears that this adaptor is slow, but not USB-1 speed by any means.Because I need a fast card in my camera but can wait for pictures to transfer to my PC, this is not that big a deal.  Especially since it was free.On the road, I'll use it with my netbook.  At home, I'll use the SanDisk unit.

$review_text.: This backpack is more of a day hike/biking pack first and then a camera pack second. Hence, it caters to a specific audience-those with DSLRs and a short lens (say 24-70 zoom) and possibly a flash who want a pack that can carry other things-like spare shirts, socks, food, water, etc. If you have a zoom lens, you will have to stick it in the top with the other items but you might need to buy padding separately if you fill it with other items as there are no more padded compartment dividers from the top.The narrow frame of this pack make it especially suitable for biking and hiking, but I would venture to note that it is water repellent but not water proof, hence one might want to think twice about taking this white water rafting or kayaking on the rapids.Overall the construction is good, although when fully loaded the straps have inadequate padding for long term comfort. Zippers open smoothly- no issues.

$review_text.: The sound through these GR07 IEM earbuds just gets better and better the more you use them
After the initial burn in time of about 200 hours, you'll find the depth of sound you can hear in each song is incredible
I find that even after the initial burn in time, music will still sound better after you've had a few initial songs play through them each time you use them again
The highs are amazing and the clarity is like crystal

Not heavy on the bass by any means, but after some burning it, they definitely do have enough
Voices sound clear and you can literally detect every layer of sound in a song

Rather than everything blending together into one sound, you can actually detect the different volumes of each of the different instruments and voices
The sound is much more like listing to music in person, or on a high quality set of speakers, rather than that of typical earbuds.Their design is unique, so take some time to make sure you have them in the correct ear and also that you adjust the posts that hold the ear tips, as they can move forward and back to best align with your ear

Without realizing the posts adjust, it may look as though the left ear and right ear bud should be in the opposite ears
Also these have an over-the-ear design, so the cables should wrap over your ear, not hang down like most people are use to
There are a ton of tips in all different sizes that come with this set


I find that using the smallest one works best for me, since I have very small ears


Once you have set the posts to the right angle for best fit and also found the correct tip for your ear sizes, you will find these offer stellar sound and amazing noise isolation

I can be in the same room with my two kids playing video games right beside me, while they are yelling and hollering and when I have music on, I can't hear a single thing from them

Nothing at all
I've never had earbuds with such effective noise isolation before, it's amazing.The cable is slim, but thicker than most, which is a good thing since it will be less susceptible to breakage
It feels quality in design and I have no issues with tangling
The earbuds come with two forms of storage, the first being a small round case for the earphones themselves


It zips around and is a about the size of the palm of my hand (small hands)
The second form of storage is a small pouch which is for holding all the tips

The whole set arrives in a plastic case with a black velvet setting.I'm completely blown away by the sound from these


Once you take a little time to get these all set perfectly for your ears (the tips, adjusting positioning, etc) and you've let them burn in for a good amount of time, you'll find they play music unlike any others

Just amazing!I was provided a sample of these for reviewing purposes.

$review_text.: The product itself looks solid and I have no complaints about the look and feel of it. However, I found two problems that's stopping me from giving it a 5-star.1. I tried to install two 3.5" drives, the slot on the left hand side (from the picture) won't detect the drive. I tried rotating the drives and found that it's the problem of the left slot. However, It works fine for my 2.5" so I'm keeping the docking station.2. The data transfer rate stays consistent at 45MB/s for my Samsung 7200RPM drive under Windows copy. I can easily achieve 90MB/s from other cases so I doubt there's a problem with my USB3 drivers or settings.It didn't meet my expectation overall but I'm too lazy to return it,== Update ==The seller sent me a replacement unit and this one works perfectly. I have no problem installing two 3.5" with the replacement unit.

$REVIEW.: I bought this gps recently, I've had a few weeks to play with it and overall I find it a pretty good device with a decent price point.Mine came from amazon with the 2008 maps, after registering/updating the firmware (firmware is separately/freely updatable via the garmin webupdater) I was able to download and install the 2009 map set (about 2 gig download). It installed with no issues, tho it did take some time. I recommend doing it over night. You have a limited time to finish the download, and of course future/other map sets cost additional money.The built in maps and POI's seem to be fairly accurate, as does the navigation routes. I settled on the 'emergency' vehicle which seems to give the best balance of speed vs shortest distance.Lack of being able to add more than 1 additional waypoint is a disappointment, albeit I knew this before buying.The mp3 player is very simplistic and has an apparently un-documented limit of ~1000 tracks. It also can be finicky about large embedded album art or malformed/corrupted tags causing the device to simply shut off.The bluetooth connected to my older motorola phone (v551) with no problems, but I am disappointed that the gps does not have the profiles for using bluetooth headsets directly with gps (ie for mp3 playback etc). The range seems quite good, as I've left the unit on in my drive way and had my cell ring in the house while it was still connected via bluetooth so I had to manually disco to make/receive calls while not in the car.There is a headphone out plug, so you can use any normal wired headphones and the sound quality seems fairly decent. No external volume control can make it annoying if mp3 volume or external noise varies alot.I bought a 8 gig memory card and it works fine (aside from problematic mp3's as noted above).Battery life seems to be around 6ish hours with backlight on, but you can configure it to turn it off after some time.It is small enough to fit in your front/back pockets, although I would be very cautious about sitting on it as it seems somewhat fragile.I really wish that it had a lanyard loop so that I could attach a carry strap to it like most phones/mp3 players. The case itself, being smooth plastic, may lend itself to being easily dropped.The included accessories were a small wall brick charger, a usb connector/charger, a car charger cord, a vaccuum suction mount and a dash mount sticky pad (although I wouldn't really recommend using the sticky pad).This is my first gps, so I don't really have anything to compare it to. I find it relatively easy to use, although I wish it had a qwerty option and the antenna did not shut off the gps function when closed (it goes into simulator mode).I use the garmin lock, which either requires entering a 4 digit pin or being at your 'home' location (you have to be able to get the sats locked on tho).There is an annoying press "OK" to continue warning/disclaimer, but I am going assume that most/all units have that 'safety feature' nowadays.Overall, so far, a good device and I would recommend it to most people.
$SUMMARY.: Pretty nice unit at a decent price point

$review_text.: This little guy is wonderful. Got it for our 2 week trip to Texas since I didn't want to pay for wifi at the hotels.(I made back the $40 monthly fee in just 4 nights on the road) Used my PC as well as my itouch all along the 1500 mile trip from California to Texas and then back again. Since it utilizes the Sprint phone lines you can get coverage anywhere you can get Sprint phone service. Which is just about everywhere. Virgin Mobile is still the only service that does not make you sign a contract,it's all month to month or week to week. Whichever you prefer. It's $40 a month unlimited service or $10 for 10 days limited. Start up and connection was a breeze, but if you run into any problems the Virgin Mobile people are just a phone call away. They are really great. After using it almost constantly for 2 weeks I started having a little problem with it(couldn't get it to stay on) when I called they said since I was still within the first month of service they would just replace it. It actually has a one year guarantee, but the first month is "no questions ask" kinda thing. I've had the replacement for 2 months and absolutely no problems. I used a generic car charger a lot on the trip and that may not have been the best thing for the little guy. I have since gotten a car charger specifically for the MIFI and it works perfectly. Bought an extra battery so I now have almost 9 hours of charge time. My son in Texas doesn't have home wifi, so I gave him a mifi 2200 for Christmas he loves it and keeps it going all the time. No problems at all with his. It's so small just slips into a pocket or purse then when one battery starts going out I just switch it with the other charged one. Like most reviewers it is a little tricky turning it off. It takes one or two tries, but I have found if you have all the devices that you had connected to it turned off before you try to turn off the mifi it will usually turn off the first time.

$REVIEW.: I also bought my P2770FH at Costco

 It was $300

 I had sold myself on the P2770H based on some reviews and mostly the fact that a geek friend had picked one for himself

 Costco dropped the P2770H from their website so I rushed to the store to see if I could still grab one

 They had the P2770H on display, but they were selling the newer P2770FH for the same price, the P2770H models were gone


 I figured it was a good deal for the same price.It's been a headache, I'm not happy, and this panel may go back
 I'm running off of my new Dell Precision with 64 bit Windows 7 and and ATI graphics card that has Display Port output


 My first connection was with a male DP to male HDMI cable and it made the panel look terrible
 Loading the Samsung driver didn't help

 Text was particularly bad, in spreadsheets and webpages

 Calibrating didn't help


 The brightness and colors change a lot when viewed at only modest angles, like when viewing the panel from standing.More geek help at work and I was told that my video card probably couldn't support HDMI and I should connect to the DVI input (it has one of each)
 I used a DP to DVI connector that came with the card and the DVI cable that came with the monitor and now text on documents looks good
 Not great, but good - and that's after using the clear text routine
 The panel is still really bad off angle

 Direct viewing is good, but this is a big disappointment


 Maybe my video card isn't completely compatible, I'm still hoping for a breakthrough setting this monitor up so I can really enjoy it.I decided to drop the bucks for an outstanding 27" and so far, this isn't it.Update:More advice from co workers today
 The opinion shared with me today is that the video card that came with my new Dell (256 MB ATI FireMV 2260) is probably just a middle-of-the-road card that can't keep up with the Samsung panel

 I'm advised, and I plan to: hook a blu-ray player up to the hdmi input and see what the panel can really do


 Now I have to buy a blu-ray player, but no harm there


 If the panel looks the way I think it should on blu-ray I'll probably upgrade my video card to something better with native hdmi output and give the Samsung the chance it deserves
 This coworker has professional experience working with graphics and has been right so far.I went to Frye's today to compare monitors
 The signal they were feeding the monitors was poor and not one of the panels looked good

 Nonetheless, none of the various panels on display were as bad as my P2770H is for off-angle viewing as it's currently set up.More to come, but I am also checking out the LG M2762D and the ViewSonic VX2739WM.Update 2:I hooked up a Blu-ray player to the hdmi on this monitor and watched a couple of minutes of Iron Man 2
 At about 1:45 into the movie there is a scene where the only light in the room is a bare bulb hanging on a wall of a room


 The walls have deep texture and the scene is done in low light


 This scene really brings out the problem in this monitor


 Moving my point of view outside of about 90 degrees on vertical or 120 degrees or so horizontal the picture gets darker
 Veiwing from below seems to be less forgiving than viewing from above
As I move my viewpoint around the level of brightness and visible detail on the texture of the wall changes enormously

 Not acceptable.This was the final test

 The monitor is no better with an optimum Blu-ray hookup to the hdmi than it is off the video card


 I like to be able to work both standing and sitting at my desk and the problem is bad enough that the image has suffered from the flop by the time I'm at a standing view angle

 I don't know if I bought a lemon or if this is a characteristic of the model

 I'm going to try the viewsonic.

$review_text.: My stock Asus comes with some 3rd rate wifi card.  It has trouble seeing my wifi-N channel, only the 802.11 b/g one.  Transfer rate is not that great either.  So I swapped it with the this one.  Just install the drive and it worked like a charm.  Strong reception and reliable connection.UPDATE:However, on my new ENVY 17t-2000 model laptop, it came with the same model of wireless module.  I have been experiencing constant crash/freezes.  It happens when I tried to download file from the net and transferring file between my laptop and my NAS.  I tried updating the BIOS, drivers, re-install drivers to no avail.  When I disabled the wireless module and go hard wire, everything is good.  Now, my laptop won't even start.  Says "Wireless module not Support....The system has detected a wireless module installed in the system that is not supported.  System halted.  Please remove device and restart....WLAN module id (0702)"  I am going through HP support right now.  Will update once more information is learned.UPDATE II:Got my Envy17 back from HP for repair.  They repaired/replaced the logic board.  Seems like the issue is not with the wifi card itself.  I have confirmed this prior to sending it to HP by inserting several other wifi cards and they all show the same error message.  As such, I have updated my rating to 5.

$REVIEW.: Make sure to understand what kind of signal you receive before purchasing this antenna. I live in an area with both UHF and VHF digital TV signals. This antenna is great at picking up UHF channels, but it does not pickup VHF well. This antenna has the most gain on the UHF band.I wish the gain specifications were listed for this antenna in the description. I've tried both the high performance and extreme performance model, the only difference is the extreme performance comes with an amplifier. In my case, even with an amplifier I was not able to pickup the VHF channels in my area.I had to get a larger antenna with better VHF gain. Due to the nature of VHF signals and their larger wavelengths, a larger antenna is needed. UHF wavelengths are much shorter so a small antenna works great for them.
$review_summary.: Good for UHF (Channels 14+), not good for VHF (Channels 7 to 13)

$REVIEW.: I am currently on my second pair of these Headphones and I just ordered two new pairs because mine are finally starting to fall apart after almost two years. While I do agree that these aren't fancy they are awesome for working out and running. I tried many different pairs of in-ear buds and over the ear headphones and most of them led to complete misery when I was running. I spent most of my run dealing with one side or the other popping out of my ears. Maybe I am just anatomically deformed but I have never had a problem with these.My only issue with these headphones are that you do have to be very careful if you choose to fold them up. I haven't broken as many pairs as some but it did happen with the first pair I purchased. At the end of the day though these things are so cheaply priced I would rather buy an extra pair. If you run frequently these can't be beat!

If I had seen its dimensions, I never would have ordered this product... but that would have been my loss. There was no setup or learning curve.

$REVIEW.: My first Antec case and I'm impressed.  The quality is excellent and I really appreciate the fit and finish.  I can route all my cables smartly due to the existing rubber grommet holes on the back plate.  There are also numerous zip-tie cutouts for me to tie everything down neatly.  This makes the interior look neat and orderly.  Installing HDDs and SSDs in the drive bays was very simple.  My CD Rom fit perfectly.  The case is large.  Very large.  Probably should be classified as a full tower.  This means the inside is enormous.  But you should be aware that the case itself is huge.I like the look of the case.  It's simple on the outside with a "titanium" front door (made of plastic).  I opted for this color choice - there is also a black version which has, as you can guess, a black front door.  The sides of the case come apart easily with thumb screws and a slight tilt towards the user (that is, you don't "slide" the sides back, you "pull" them towards you as you are facing the side of the case).  The interior is painted in black and looks nice.  The sides and front door have a mat or padding on them, obviously for sound dampening.The case came with three fans - two on the top towards the back and one on the rear.  They were all plugged into a mini fan controller (accessible from the outside of the case, on the back).  I had to get a MOLEX extension to power the fan controller since my power supply did not have a MOLEX power plug long enough.  Did I mention this case is big?The fans, on the low setting, are silent.  As in, I could not tell they were running just by listening.  On "high" I could hear a slight WOOSH sound, nothing that I would even pay attention to once I was using the computer.  The front of the case has spots for two 120mm fans.  They are covered by the front door and a removable filter.  I bought a Cooler Master PWM fan and it fit perfectly.  The case comes with enough screws to attach at least two if not three more fans to the case.  You could also add two 120mm fans to the back of the hard drive rack, which would position them somewhere in the middle of the case between the front fans and the back.  I didn't do this, but it's a neat feature I've never seen before.  I presume if you have a huge video card this option might not be feasible.My Cooler Master 212 EVO CPU cooler fits in the case without any problem.  Of course I checked this out before purchasing it, but if you are a 212 EVO owner, you will be happy to know it fits just fine.My Antec power supply mounted to the bottom of the case without problems.  I have the air intake for the power supple facing "down" because the case has an opening on the bottom under the power supply, and a removable and cleanable filter there as well.Power and reset buttons are on the top.  I have no opinion on this - they work as expected.  Just be aware if you are someone who puts things on the top of the case, you might cover the power/reset buttons, or hit them by mistake.USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports are on the top front and are not hidden by the front door.  I like that, as I can plug in a device without opening the door.When running, the case is silent.  You might hear some whispers from the air moving though the fans, but otherwise, the case is quiet.  Very quiet.  My GTX550 TI, even with it's ridiculous fan, is quiet(er) in this case.  I plan on buying another cooling solution for this card at some point in the future.  When the fan on this card gets going, the sound is audible despite the case's best efforts to quell the noise.  When the fan is not ramping it's speed up, you cannot hear it.  All the other fans in the case including the CPU fan are inaudible.I don't pay too much attention to the CPU or GPU temperature - as long as they're not overheating, then I'm not worried about them.  The case does a great job at keeping the air flowing without sounding like a wind tunnel or jet.  Again, I cannot hear the fans, and my CPU and GPU are never hot or overheating.  I'm sure you can find temperature benchmarks regarding the components in this case.  I can tell you from experience that my components are cool and heat is not a problem in this case.Overall I would say this is the best case I've ever bought.  The quality is great and the fit and finish is some of the best I've ever encountered.  In my opinion, it was very much worht the price I paid for it.  The case is big, and it's also quite heavy.  I'd say it weights about 30 lb with all my stuff in it.  You would have to work hard to knock it over.  It's a big case that IMHO looks cool, not flashy, and works exactly as intended.  It's quiet and keeps my components cool without sounding like a turbine.Prior to this case, I usually spent as little as possible on cases.  After buying this Antec, and seeing the quality and value, I would recommend it to anyone who wants a quiet quality case.The only con I can I have is that it's heavy, so if you plan on lugging it around, you might look for a smaller, lighter case, a MiniITX or MicroATX case.  It also doesn't make me coffee in the am.

$REVIEW.: I used this with my tecsun pl-606


Indoors it did nothing

Outdoors, I hung it from my 2nd story balcony


It brought in over three times as many stations than using the whip antenna

For stations I could get in without it, the signal was cleaner and stronger

It worked better when plugged in than when clipped on (even though when clipped it still showed an improvement)
It is very easy to reel in when done.

$SUMMARY.: 3x as many stations outdoors!

$REVIEW.: This is my first heart rate monitor so I can't really compare to others but I have been pleasantly surprised at how easy this is to use and how comfortable it is. Based on other reviews I expected the chest strap to be uncomfortable and the buttons to be difficult to push. The Mode button on the "watch" was difficult to push the first time or two but is not difficult at all now. I can easily push the buttons while in an aerobics class or on my bike with no difficulty. The chest strap is very comfortable and fits snugly (it is adjustable), if I weren't checking the monitor I would forget I have it on. I have found it to be very accurate for the pulse rate and, although the directions say to wet the electrodes before applying them to the skin, it seems to work well even if that is not done. Another nice feature is that the numbers are large enough to be visible to those of us who need readers to see small print. Additionally, I am a small woman and some of the monitor watches are like wearing a laptop on my wrist. This one is about the size (or smaller) of one of those oversize fashion watches that are popular.Although I have used other Garmin products and been happy with them I was skeptical about how well I would like this and how accurate it would be but I could not be more thrilled.  I am going to order the footpod to go with it!

$review_text.: I am old enough to remember how large and heavy &#34;portable&#34; recording gear was in the past. We used to carry it around with shoulder straps that weighed heavily on us, or in heavy equipment cases. The Tascam DR-60D offers just about every feature that could be had in pro portable gear and then some in a small, light package.I like the form factor very much. It isn't a &#34;handheld&#34; portable, although it can rest in palm of the hand if desired. It is large enough to be workable and small enough to be portable. I just wish that the controls weren't so tiny. However, if they were made larger than the size of the DR-60D would obviously increase proportionally.The DR-60D is equipped either for use with a DSLR to handle the audio chores, or as a standalone portable recorder (the way that I am using it.)  The top of the unit is a detachable DLSR attachment that allows it to be mounted on a tripod with a DSLR. When I removed the DSLR attachment I needed to find a place for it where it would be available should I ever decide to use the DR-60D with my DSLR. Using captive screws into the DSLR camera base would have been a nice touch. In that manner when the DSLR attachment bracket was removed the screws would stay with the bracket and not have to be stored in a safe place or screwed back to the recorder top.I very much like that the unit takes standard AA batteries and supports SD cards. Tascam avoided using special rechargeable batteries and those tiny micro SD cards. This makes obtaining cards or batteries in the field quite easy.If you&#8217;ve ever used a Tascam DR (Digital Recorder) the menu structure of the DR-60D will be immediately familiar to you. The menu options, although different in places, are much as are found on the other Tascam digital recorders. That made for a very short learning curve for me as I have owned Tascam portable recorders previously.There is a Dual mono mode (selectable from the Record Menu) that is a lifesaver. I have a number of reel-to-reel tapes that were recorded in 1/2 track mono. Normally, I&#8217;d have to use a Y-connector or dodge one channel over to the other using my audio processing software to get the mono audio distributed over both the left and right channels. The DR-60 takes care of this in recording using the Dual mode and even indicates this with a &#8220;DUAL&#8221; LED on the front panel. Very well done!(There is also a Dual Stereo mode should you be so inclined.)As for battery life, the DR-06D does eat batteries. Using Alkaline AA batteries gave me for approximately 2 hours of recording time.  I would have liked to see the batteries last longer.All-in-all I really like the DR-60D (as you can probably tell.) It will have a permanent place in my production studio.

$REVIEW.: If you are looking for a great looking dock solution for your MacBook Pro this is the product for you.  The BookArc may has well have been made by Apple because it works so well with the MacBook Pro that you'd think it came with the laptop.  The only thing holding it back from a 5 star rating is that you have to power the laptop on while open and then close the lid before docking.  And that's more the laptops fault.

$review_text.: UPDATE: After my initial review (in-tact below for reference), Anker reached out to me (on their own!) to offer to replace my unit free of charge and at no cost to me (including free shipping). The replacement unit addressed the port sizing issues described below and I've had no issues with any USB devices not fitting into any of the hub's ports. Great customer service and the replacement product works as advertised.  I'd certainly recommend this product (and more importantly, this company) to anyone.  It also goes to show the importance of honestly reviewing products you purchase online.  You might be pleasantly surprised by the experience.ORIGINAL REVIEW (3/5 stars): I picked this up because my new laptop only has 2 USB ports and I was consuming both of them between my mouse's receiver and my required GbE dongle... this does what it purports and turns 1 port into 4, but I have issues with some USB devices even fitting into the ports (my mouse's receiver was one. I've had 2 or 3 USB thumb drives that were difficult to insert).  After fiddling a bit, I was able to get the thumb drives inserted, but the mouse receiver is still a no-go.  I've since replaced the mouse with a true bluetooth mouse that requires no receiver and picked up a USB 3.0 dual-head graphics adapter that includes a GbE port as well so the need to use this regularly no longer exists. In a pinch I can use it to connect a couple of devices when I need to but it's not the best experience I've had and I could only recommend it to someone who's knowledgeable enough to know what should be able to connect so they are willing to force the adapters into the ports.  Definitely not "mom proof."

$REVIEW.: My husband is from the UK and had brought all of his UK DVDs with him when he moved 3 years ago. We had previously bought another unit that was too complicated to figure out (and never did actually play the UK DVDs), so we took it back. A few months ago we decided to try again and ordered this one. It works great for the price and hopefully it will last a little bit longer than another poster's "one year." Plus, you can plug a USB "memory stick" in and view pictures on the TV if you want. We do not use it much since the majority of our DVDs work on our other DVD for the US zone. Very happy campers!

This new unit features new features, like the backlight and more memory, than the previous DT100 model. It should hopefully last as long as the last one. The only concern is the switch to Digital TV in February, I imagine we will lose the TV reception. That is too bad, as my wife uses it to listen to Letterman and the late shows with a pillow speaker. I dropped a star (4 out of 5) due to Sangean not addressing this issue which is scheduled in just three months.

$review_text.: This Memory card is Speedy and Reliable. I use it in my Canon Eos Rebel T3i aka Canon 600D. My first memory card for my Camera was a Lexar 32GB class 10 card, it is a bit faulty though but still saves my files. (Won't go into details, i still use it as a backup.)So I bought this Transcend card as my main memory card and I love it. It is speedy and writes very quickly. I MANUALLY compose my pictures and I ONLY shoot in RAW file mode. Which means 1 picture file is anywhere between 18-26MB give or take.Compared to shooting in Large Jpeg where 1 picture file is around 4-8MB. There were times I was shooting at high speeds continuously where the cameras buffer got filled up writing to the memory card due to the amount of shots I took and the file size per shot.(Camera screen normally goes black and no more pictures can be taken till the process has finished) I would have to wait on the camera till the files were saved but there aren't any problems. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid performing Memory card. Good speed, reliable, good GB size for the money.Find me on Flickr~Go to Flickr~Then type in a "/" then "photos" then "/" and last type in "suipeter"And that should take you there.

$REVIEW.: I gave this lens five stars on the basis that it' a very good budget lense. It provides good sharpness and a lot of benefits for this price range. A pro could use it if he doesn't brag about it. If you've got the bucks buy the Canon lenses. If not, this is a good package. There's something called a throwaway lens. It does the job, doesn't cost too much and if for some reason it disappears through theft, etc., it doesn't break the bank.I bought this as a temporary replacement of a Canon lens, i.e. the 70-300mm DO. Ihad a confidence problem with that lens whciih lost sharpness without any good reason. I got the Sigma lens the day before leaving. I did some quick tests and it look okay. So I took it. Real time use proved it could fill a hole in my kit. The first day's images from the lens were checked on the laptop I travel with. They looked good. There are instances where the contrast is a bit week. I've dialed that up in the camera settings and it at least looks good in Canon DPP.The build quality isn't as obviously good on the surface as Canon. It's more utilitarian in appearance. But form does follow function for the most part.The front section of the lens rotates while focusing. if you use filters where orientation matters, you'll have do a workaround or do it in photoshop.Switching to macro mode and back out of it is somewhat clumsy.  Offsetting that is that there is a Macro which I find very useful..

$REVIEW.: This is about the 6th AUX extension cable I've purchased. All of them before didn't snap in fully, or were loose. Those that did work developed strains where you had to hold the cord at a certain angle to work. This cord snaps nicely in to my Galaxy S4 and a FM transmitter. The connections are high quality and I expected it to last!

$REVIEW.: These capacitive styli are as sturdy and well made as the Big Box brands, but you'll get 3 styli instead of the one and save a good 15-20 bucks in the process!  They work great for quality screens, but unfortunately cheaper less responsive touchscreens will struggle a bit to sense swipes and clicks here.  Not much you can do there, but hey.If you're willing to wait a bit to own a stylus for your iPad/iPhone 4S or whatever, I'd go with these as a purchase.  If you 'need it now', maybe it's better to just go to the store and spend the 25 bucks for a name brand version of these styli, but a deal's a deal.  Enjoy.
$SUMMARY.: Just as good as the name brands without the markup!

$review_text.: In spite of the needlessly snotty comment by another reviewer, I agree with K. Patten, the listing is a bit deceptive, although I don't know if this is intentional, or merely sloppiness.And while it is true that the pricing is a bit of a clue, I saw low quality dummy cameras for a buck a piece a while back in one of the electronics surplus catalogs, so it isn't completely out of the question.When you think about it, it is a small, lightweight piece of plastic, and a blinking led (the blink circuitry is on the led's die).  There are kid's toys out there that come packed in a piece of plastic with a blinking led as an attention getter - and that's the part you throw away!  I see no reason a low grade "least cost" unit couldn't go for this price, although I agree it would normally be sold for a little more.  In any case, there are better looking units for sale here than this one, although they do cost slightly more.Note to J. Serdynski:  If you read so well, why did you misspell K. Patten's last name? (twice!)  And why are you so angry at the world that you savaged this person twice, once in your review, and again in a comment under their review? Just wondering, and hoping you can get past the whole anger thing.

$REVIEW.: I will begin by stating what this product is not:  a gaming graphics card.  For those of you looking for a gaming card, you would get far more bang for your buck from the NVidia GeForce line, which offers more memory, higher clock speeds, and more CUDA cores for the same money.  This card is a workstation product targeted to users of graphics-intensive technical applications, including CAD, GIS, and various photo and video-editing applications.  For these uses, this product far outperforms comparably-priced gaming video cards, and offers much better render quality and stability.I installed this card in a Dell PowerEdge Xeon box, which I converted from an entry-level server into a workstation.  Installation was very painless, with WHQL-certified drivers for Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and Server 2008 and 2012 readily available from NVidia, in 32 or 64-bit packages, as ready-to-use executables.  A word of caution to BSD and linux users, NVidia is notoriously cranky about third-party operating system support, so I would advise you to either research drivers in advance or go with an ATI/AMD product.My workload comprises largely GIS work, utilizing ESRI ArcGIS and Quantum GIS.  The render performance of both applications improved markedly when I went from my old GeForce 500 series card to this.  GIS datasets in Arc and QGIS of the gigabyte-class (containing on the order of 100,000 features) typically load in under 10 seconds, as opposed to taking up to a minute with more basic video cards.  While I cannot comment on the performance of comparably-priced GeForce cards, this product has made rending large GIS datasets far more palatable than the entry-level GeForce.  Also, through a simple modification of the "supported cards" text file in Adobe CS6 video applications (Premiere Pro and After Effects), this card also supports the Adobe GPU-accelerated Mercury render engine, which very much improves render performance.  Combining this card with 8 GB of DDR3 and a 3.1 GHz Xeon E3-1220, I am now able to render 1080p30 H.264 videos in 95% or greater of real-time.  Render performance of other vector software, such as Adobe Illustrator and AutoCAD, also improved markedly with this card.  I can work on 100 Mb plus CAD files in Civil3D with negligible lag in rendering.  I cannot comment on performance in Blender, 3dfs, or other 3-d rendering applications, as I have not used any.Thus, for users seeking a solid mid-range workstation card, I very much recommend this product.  For users seeking a better gaming experience, something likePNY NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 2GB GDDR5 2DVI Mini HDMI PCI-Express Video Card VCGGTX650XPBwould serve much better.

 Installation went really well, the instructions were perfectly clear and I was up and running in about 10 minutes or so
 Only glitch I had was that I powered off the router to make room for additional plugs,and I soon realized that the Magic Jack was not functioning

I powered it off and back on and everything is as "good as it gets"


At the end of the day I was glad I purchased and I am now able to talk to my family who live in different states with good clarity


Also I realize that I should be able to save 11 months of of billing from my old phone carrier.

$review_text.: This camera case comfortably holds my Canon Power Shot SD 1100 IS Digital Elph point and shoot camera and a spare SD card.  But, it will not also hold a cable, extra battery or battery charger.  The sides of the case are stiff and the interior is smooth, so this case offers some protection for the camera and the LCD screen.  There is a detachable lanyard which can be used for securing the case around the user's neck or wrist.The zippered compartment has two pulls and opens on the two long sides and one short side.  An interior pocket without a zipper will hold a SD card.  There are also two elastic ribbons that keep the case from fully opening, a feature that should help prevent the camera from accidentally falling out when the case is unzipped.This case is small enough to fit in a medium sized pocket (it fits in the front pockets of my jeans) or just about any type of bag.  However, it is not suitable as the only case for a long trip since it will only accommodate the camera and a spare SD card.  This case, therefore, might be the perfect container for your camera for a day trip or short outing and might also avoid the need to lug a larger camera bag around.
$SUMMARY.: Good for a Short Outing

$review_text.: It's mostly vague everywhere, but this mouse requires you to have the usb-dongle connected at all times!  It's not a hybrid system like the Razer Mamba/Orochi that supports wired functionality, so this mouse becomes a heavy paper-weight if you lose or forget the dongle somewhere.Also, it's TWO usb slots this device can take up instead of the ONE to zero most wireless take, especially for notebook use.The analog left/right is a bit strange to me compared to the more natural trackball movement the Mighty Mouse offers -- the only good thing about that mouse.  Probably a patent issue here.I moved up from a MX500, really like the MX1000, so it's not that big of a jump in terms of Logitech functionality except for the size, it's a bit heavy, and the wireless capability.

$REVIEW.: I bought this initially to sync my Samsung Infuse android phone to my iMac for picture transfer, doc folder sync, etc.  It works great.  It also works with a WD portable hard drive that travels along with my laptop although the drive noise produced a harmonic buzz in my desk, which I can live with.  Just goofing around with a USB-to-Apple adapter that I'd bought for my wife's iPhone 3GS, I found that it worked with no problems.  It even worked with an older TomTom GPS unit (GO 720) when I needed to update the firmware - with a micro-to-mini USB adapter.  All in all, I'm pleased with the stand.If I had a couple of things to suggest to the manufacturer, it would be that the base needs to be wider to keep things from falling over, since all of my devices have the USB plug on the end and they stand up pretty tall - even taller with some of the adapters I had to use.  Personal devices in general are getting larger, too, so if this thing is to stand the test of time, it needs to be wider.

$review_text.: I purchased this antenna to receive both UHF and VHF signals from my local stations.  100% of the TV towers I'm wanting are located in the same spot 20.1 miles away.  I live in Gilbert, AZ and the towers are on South Mountain for those familiar.  I attached the antenna to my house between my first and second floor, outside, pointing towards the towers.  While I cannot see the towers with my eyes, there is not much in the way (no huge tree or house right there).  I then ran 100' of RG6 cable to my main cable box on the other side of the house to distribute the signal to the TVs inside.  I did not use a pre-amp or signal booster at all, and the signal does pass through a 4-way signal splitter.I was able to receive all my local channels with very good signal quality using my HTPC and an HDHomeRun DUAL receiver.  This includes both UHF and VHF stations.  I even receive some of the other not quite local stations or low-power stations as well, but I don't watch them, so I comment too much on their signal quality.  I get around 80% signal consistently, which equates to NO pixalation or audio drops.  The signal is consistent, which is excellent as before I'd have to constantly move my bunny ears around to try and get the best signal that day.In the future I might need an 8-way signal splitter and if I do, I'll either add a pre-amp to the setup or boost the signal at the splitter itself.The build quality is quite good.  It comes pretty much assembled, and you'll need to snap some of the elements into place (rotate until they lock).  It's aluminum, so it's lightweight.  It's medium sized for antennas, large enough you can't just hide it, but it was small enough my wife didn't notice it at first (I installed it while she was away).  It seems very durable, I didn't notice anything of concern, but I've had it up only a couple months now.

$REVIEW.: After seeing a number of professionals in the HDSLR and pro video world rave about this monopod, I decided to give it a try


 The product arrived in a huge box about three times the size of the monopod, so I was nervous that it might be larger than I expected


 However, the monopod itself at it's smallest size comes up to just below my waist (i'm 6'1")


 When I picked it up, I could feel the weight and build quality, and it feels like a professional, solid device.Using the monopod is really quite simple
 There are three feet that fold out that give the monopod some stabilization to allow you to pull in easily and tilt with the entire pole instead of just the fluid head
 These feet are large enough that you could leave the monopod standing straight up with a camera on it and it will work essentially like a tripod
 To be sure, I would not leave it in such a position in any amount of wind or if I cared dearly about my camera or lenses


 The ball joint at the bas allows for those moves and tilts and is a bit sticky at first, so you need to keep the device moving as you start a shot to avoid a pop in the video, but I imagine over time this problem might resolve itself.The release plate is a standard Manfrotto plate, so if you have other Manfrotto heads you will be able to leave the plate on the camera body to swap between products effortlessly

 The foot adjusts in height quite easily with the standard locking clip


 The pole itself is a nice, hefty metal, and even the smallest portion of it feels strong
 Although the device is expensive, for the money it could definitely take a good beating and seems to be able to hold quite a deal of weight on top of it.The handle is okay for pans and tilts, but i have been resting it against my shoulder so that there is a fourth point of contact with the camera (right hand on the grip, left hand on the lens, bas on the monopod) to help better stabilize the shot.I would recommend this product to anyone who shoots events, as you get get a wide range of stabilized shots that bridge the gap between a tripod and a steadicam or shoulder rig
 I have also used it in narrative work and it has allowed me to get tripod-like shots in spaces where I would never have ben able to fit a tripod


 I use a DSLR and some decent glass, so if the plate is not slid forward or back enough, the whole rig becomes front heavy
 The only issue I have had with the plate, is that with the Canon 24-105mm, I need to slide the plate back so far that i loose access to the zoom ring.If you only want to purchase one stabilization device for your camera, I would recommend this hands down over a tripod


 This product is so versatile because it allows you to get great stable shots wide, close up, and in tight spaces with the ability to set up and take down much faster than one would with a tripod


Although it does not do everything a shoulder rig or tripod can and are meant to do, it performs well enough for use in many situations.

$review_text.: As with most 5850s, this thing spits out plenty of pixels and consumes very little power, particularly at idle. Unfortunately, you have to put up with ATI drivers to get it. (As of right now, Catalyst 10.7 causes the video subsytem to crash under Win7 x64 for many people, recommend using 10.5 until this gets fixed.)Overall, I'm willing to put up with ATI's driver problems because the performance to power consumption ratio is really amazing on this card (at least according to the usual review sites), and I can run Star Trek Online at near max settings even though I'm using a 1920x1080 monitor. (Side note: never enable Dynamic Lighting in STO if you use an ATI card.)My main beef is with the physical card itself. One day, Diamond will make a card that fits in the slot and screws in without a lot of grunting, bending, sweating, and swearing. I should've learned my lesson from my previous Diamond cards. Well, you know what they say: fool me once, shame on you; fool me... can't get fooled again!Dear Diamond, I will buy your engineers a ruler. I'll give it to them for free.

After all they want you to buy another longer length of cable instead of splicing what you have.

$REVIEW.: 07/19/12 UpdateThe RAM caused hard crashes (requiring an on/off to restart).  Ran Memory (Memory Test) and the RAM failed.  Returning today and purchasing the Patriot RAM.  Now that I've seen the MBP running on 16GB it is painful to go back to 4GB.********I just received 16MB of RAM for my MacBookPro (8,2 model).  The computer reads all 16GB of RAM and is now screaming fast.  Outlook 2011 jumps open, Word, Firefox, etc. all snap open.  It is a pleasure to open these apps.  Highly recommend the RAM upgrade.  Amazon's price was the lowest I found on the web and Komputerbay's product has worked flawlessly (mac recognizes everything etc.).  I just ran MS Updater and the updates were seconds long as opposed to minutes with the standard 4GB of RAM.  Such a dramatic improvement.The installation process is easy 9-10 screws and the memory is very accessible.  I should have made this upgrade a year ago.

$review_text.: Having never setup a wireless connection I was not sure how this would go. I could not have been easier. First I opened the package. Second I read the instructions. Third connected the cable modem to the Airport Express. Fourth plugged the Express into an outlet. Fifth I enabled the Airport program on my MAC. Sixth I unplugged the power to my cable modem, waited 30 seconds and plugged it back in. Seventh I checked for a green light on the Airport Express and began surfing the internet. All this took less then 10 minutes, most of which was reading the instructions and waiting for the cable modem to reboot.Next I tried the WiFi connection with my iPhone and bingo all works fine. I have a hardwired printer and will likely keep that setup. As for the iTune connection, I may try that at sometime in the future but I connect my iPhone directly to my music system so I likely will not use that feature anytime soon. However, it's nice to know that option is there for the future.All in all I could not be happier. The WiFi speed is about the same as my former direct connection to the cable modem, maybe slightly faster.I am using a MAC and am not sure it the Windows setup is as easy.
$SUMMARY.: Easier then pouring a glass of water.

$review_text.: I have had the 32&#34; set for 3 weeks now and so far am happy with it.  It suits my general viewing purpose very well. Primarily have it hooked up on an antenna to receive local channels in HD or standard broadcast. The smart function allow me to also view streamed programs if I choose.The picture quality was good out of the box.  The screen is very clear, bright and capable for all lighting conditions. HD programs were crisp and clear in 720P. However, after adjusting the picture setting in the menu to my preferences the picture quality is now very good to excellent.  I definitely recommend turning off all the automatic picture enhancement features then, adjusting the settings back to your own personal taste. There are a couple of older reviews that can help with that chore. Its worth the effort.The built in WiFi works well for using Netflix or Amazon prime programs.  Set up was fairly easy on the WiFi. I am also impressed with the built-in audio. The speakers are louder and better than the older 32&#34; LCD this one replaced. The remote is very basic and has small buttons which could be a problem for some people. The remote buttons also do not illuminate.So far the only thing I was not impressed with was the flimsy, light weight, stand.  It also does not much of a footprint compared to the older 32&#34; TV stands it replaced (also a Vizio). So stability could be a concern with the stand that comes with the set. But the stand is not a big concern for me since I wall mounted this TV, just like the older one before it, to a very secure bracket.The one thing I have not done with this set is watched DVD's or BR disks with it. So I cannot speak of the dynamic range. I highly recommend this set for general purposes viewing.  It would be very good in a bedroom, small den/office, workshop or maybe for a student or person who need a good first TV set.
$SUMMARY.: Very good basic smart TV at a great price.

$REVIEW.: Was going to replace wall-mounted speakers for our deck.  Decided to give this a try instead.  What a great product!  When we want music on the deck, we just grab this.  Sure the SRS/WOW manipulates the sound, but who cares?; it's not very quiet outside anyway.  Sit it close to a wall; that really enhances low frequencies (bass).  Thought I'd miss having stereo, but I don't (you can get stereo by using two of these).  We don't plug it in, we use batteries.  Just replaced the first set after about 5 weeks of 2-3 hours use daily.  Mood light's a little silly, but it is cool (we seldom use it).  Don't look any further, this' the one.

$REVIEW.: I am a computer junkie.  Big time Apple fan boy.  Writing this review wearing an Apple shirt.I own 3+ laptops at any given time.  My workhorse is the Macbook Pro.  Have an Alienware m14x for gaming. Why did I buy this laptop?  For my girlfriend, of course. My girlfriend rarely uses a laptop.  She lives on my ipad most of the days.  But once in a while she wants to do some word processing and web browsing that need a little keyboard.  I bought her the Samsung series 3 a year ago and she hated it.  Everything is super slow.  She is horrified by my big powerhouse laptops.I got this laptop for her and it is just perfect.  The best part?  The good touchscreen.  It's sharp, responsive, you can pinch to zoom, just like the iPad.  She does not care about the processor, ram, or anything besides a pretty screen and slick light weight laptop.I have to admit I enjoyed using it when she has it laying around.  Remind me so much of my old macbook air, except with a nifty touch screen.  I have to say I am very impressed by my first Asus purchase.

$REVIEW.: A fresh, new M515 purchased from a local store.It comes with "unifying" adapter and installed Setpoint software and added K360 wireless keyboard with ease.The mouse is a bit heavy to handle due to 2 AA batteries used.The "unifying" adapter is a great plus if you have compatible Logi wireless input products.The sensor is covered. Unfortunately, it gets scratched very easily even it uses laser, the scratch may affect the performance, so I put a "soft" screen protector on it. After screen protector applied, the operation is smoother on any surface (even on my thigh).The mouse has a major problem which I taken away one star: it lags sometimes even I just scroll page. I think it may be caused by the "hand check" function and my hands has higher resistance and it caused some lagging problem.The scroll wheel doesn't have "click" which I preferred more, and sometimes it has "bounce" effect, but it's not big deal.If it's not cheaper than M510, I may get it instead because the sensor surface can be easily scratched.

$REVIEW.: This player has a lot going for it. It's inexpensive, versatile, runs on a single AAA battery, with plenty of volume.  The big problem is with the absence of instructions.  It took me about a week to figure out how to operate it.  There are so many functions, and button combinations, that only patient customers need apply.  However, if you persevere, and master the controls, you will be amazed at what this unit can do.

$REVIEW.: Ok.  3 days with the new case.  Fit is excellent.  This will add weight, width, length to the slim Nexus. I like the extra to hold on to.  The hinged stand is great for landscape and portrait views.  The part that hinges open for typing? mode is not for me.  It is loose (won't stay shut) and not something I wiill use. When I received the case I compared the screen clarity with and without the screen protector.  With the screen protector the text is definately less crisp.  I removed the screen protector. It will actually come off without cutting (leaves some adhesive behind)I won't be using my nexus 7 in harsh environments so the SP is not needed.  I would keep it on if used at the beach for example.  Excellent buy.

$review_text.: The mount is sturdy and easy to install. However, the design is flawed.First, I don't see why the bracket alone comes in 6 separate pieces one has to screw back together. Second, the fit on the 2 vertical braces is very bad. The vertical braces are too wide to fit properly in the indentations of the horizontal pieces. Even with rotating, I could not make them flush. Second, they use tiny short screws that further complicate assembly. I'm quite handy with tools but just assembling the bracket took 15 minutes!

$review_text.: Well! I am having 3 GPS units : Navigon 7100, Garmin c550 and Pharos Drive 150.Here are my thoughts:Signal Aquisition->c550 aquires signals almost at the startup.[Note: New Garmin units are slow in picking up signals]->Navigon takes 30 sec to 1 minutes->Pharos takes almost 90 secondsBattery LIFE->c550 has almost 3 hrs->Navigon has 1 and half hrs->Pharos has 1 and half hrsNote: Newer Garmin units are suffering from low battery life tooDisplayNavigon 7100 has extreemely sleek display than both Garmin c550 and Pharos 150. However, the c550 screen is more bright because of good color contrast they have chosen[but looks like cartoonish]. Pharos has the worst display among the 3.Mountingc550 has dead easy mounting. Navigon 7100's mounting is cool but not easy to port if you are in continuous traveling. Pharos Mounting is DEAD HELLRoutingAlmost all 3 units gave me solid routing with no exception to some weird routes. In Tucson(AZ) and Pheonix(AZ), I had used only Navigon 7100. Because of a huge highway construction going in that place, it lead me to a dead end[The Exit was closed in the night 8PM to 6AM for construction] in my very first trip [from Airport to Hampton Inn]. However, when it got traffice updates, it avoided those ramps in subsequent trips during my stay.In LongView (TX), I used all the three units[I decided to purchase GPS after I returned from Arizona due to my DEAD END experience]. I purchased c550[$160] and Pharos 150[$87]. Here is my observation:1.Short Distance Travelling[Intracity]:c550 and Pharos gave better routes than Navigon 71002.Long Distance[Intercity]: Navigon 7100 gave excellent routes. c550 lead me to dead end for 4 times.Prompt for TURN:1.Navigon 7100 prompt for turn around 1 Miles before the turn and if two turns are close-by it announces both. Next time, it announces around .2 miles than when you are 500 feet from the turn. Then, it says TURN [Right/Left] when u reached the TURN. The Next turn [or Next 2 TURNS if they are close] are shown on LEFT SIDE of the screen continuously.2.Pharos starts prompting for next TURN aroun 1 mile before it but announces that your are approching the turn many times than both Navigon 7100 and Garmin c550. I like the way it shows the NEXT turn [using a BLINKING TURN INDICATOR THAT TAKES BIGGER PORTION OF UR SCREEN TO CATCH UR ATTENTION WITHOUT DISTRACTING THE ROUTE VISIBILITY].3.SteetPilot c550 announces the least number of times and if 2 turns are in closes proximity, it informs you about them simultaneously but never prompt again for the other turn once you pass ur first turn. There are no indications what so ever on the Main Screen to indicate the next turn direction. [It's in written TEXT along with Street Name on TOP of Screen]Address Entering:1.Pharos and Garmin has almost the same way of Address Entering. They Show once Item Per Screen with Most of the Screen covered with Buttons that makes buttons larger and easy to press2.Navigon has single cumulated screen for entering all parts of Address. The Left Half of the portion shows the address parts and the Right Half of Screen has Buttons. This makes buttons smaller. THIS IS THE MAIN Complaint people are criticizing about Navigon[Navigon rectified it in their coming line of Products: Navigon 2100S, 7200T a 2200T] that will debut perhaps in first week of October or last week of SeptemberScreen Tap Response:c550 and Pharos are marginally better in screen response than Navigon but this issue is almost negligible most of the timesScreen Display [Distinct Features]1.Navigon has more display options that other 2 units. It also shows POI that come of either end of Roads during navigation[and this list is customizeable and you can select what types of POI u want to see on Map]. The display is the smoothest display I had seen so far and is the best among all available units so far in the market,2.c550 has more bright and color contrast screen that looks more cartoonish but still pleasant to eyes to look at. I like way ETA and Speed are shown on screen than other 2 units.3.Pharos has one excellent feature. Once you TAP the screen, it gives a popup gives you option directly on Map to [Route to this Location, Add to Favourites this Location].Multi-Destination Routing:1.Pharos and Navigon has multi-destination rounting but c550 doesn'tLive Traffic:1.Pharos doesn't support traffice updates at all2.c550 has MSN for subscription[$60/year] and it has been critically below standard[MSN Service]3.Navigon has life time traffice updates for free and I did get advantage of it in Tucson(AZ)Photo Viewer:only c550 has photo viewer among the 3Music Playeronly c550 has music player among the 3HACKABLE:1.Both Pharos and Navigon are hackable and use Win CE 5.0 are their core2.Garmin is not HackableMap Updates:1.So far no map updates on Pharos [but they say it will be available free of charge in first quarter of next yrs]2.Navigon has NavigonFresh that provides 12 Map Updates in 3 year for aroud$603.Garmin provides one map update per year for $60[Now, they have announced to provide quarterly map updates like Navigon from next year but charge for each one]Who is Impacting whom ?1.Garmin has stolen following features from Navigon for its 2x5T,7x5T units: [Also TOM TOM did this other than traffic update]->Reality View->Free Traffic Updates[But will show adds on your Device rather than charging u for Traffic Updates]->Lane Assistance->Quarterly Map Updates->Multiple Destination Routing that they only comeup with in their 7XX line of products2.Navigon has taken following from TOM TOM and GARMIN for its 2000S, 2200T and 7200T units expecting to debut next month->Direct Help [TOM TOM]->Where Am I [Garmin]3.Pharos has not yet announced any new units to dateWho is Doing new Innovations ?1.Currently Pharos is silent2.Garmin has used its energy to meet the features Navigon introduced with its first line of products last year and one new thing [3D Building View impacting from Navigon's Paranoma 3D introduced in Navigon 8110 in Europe]3.Navigon has introduced following new features in their upcoming line of product:->Lane Assistance Pro->Reality view Pro->3D Land Marks->Flat Panel ScreenBLUETOOTHc550 and Navigon has Bluetooth but Pharos doesn'tEXPANSION SLOT->Navigon comes with 2 GB SD card.

Navigon is perhaps the only GPS unit that challenged Garmin the most. Garmin has been providing few features to more BUCKS before Navigon. But now, not only their prices are down but also they has to provide more features within reasonable price. I know those who Love Garmin will like its interface more. I agreed as I mentioned above. Navigon has perhaps listened to these users and have improved thier interface for upcoming product line. But those who still choose Garmin should atleast say thanks for Navigon that gave too much features in less bucks that GARMIN finally forced to not only cut down its prices but also provide more features for less BUCKS. Every one is benefiting from this GPS WAR in one way or other

$review_text.: 1.  This is not a one size fits all DVD, simply because of the cost.  However, if you want a DVD for archival purposes (ex backing up photos etc...) then this is the only choice you should think of.  Now, I haven't lived for a hundred years, but I'm fairly confident that this product will deliver on it's promise of stability over the years.  I've used other standard DVDs, even the "silver" DVDs and after several years, when I would go back to open up a photo, several of the images would be corrupted or the disc would be readable by one drive but not by another.  Thankfully, I've never had such issues with the MAM-A gold discs.2.  Thus if you want the best for archival purposes, this is a definite no brainer.

$review_text.: Same thing occurred to me - I have a Dell 8400 running XPPro SP2 and an external USB Maxtor HDD - I was using all six USB ports that came with the Dell machine, however when I added the Belkin F5U237 Hub everything worked okay until I rebooted it - than Nothing but grief!!!!! I exchanged the Hub in hopes it was a defective as I really liked the two top plug in ports - same thing occured with the replacement -  after some experimenting I removed all the USB connections from my machine (i.e. MS Ofc keyboard, Maxtor external USB HDD, Video Camera, Laser PRN, Inteli-Mouse, Linksys USB Wireless Adapter) and just plugged the F5U237 Belkin Hub into the Dell Machine - guess what?  it worked as advertised - however I now have 5 USB ports I can't use - so the only thing I gained is the convinience of top loading ports for my two 1GB Scan Crusers  -

$review_text.: I recently sold my house and included my Bose Acoustimass 10 speaker system with the media room.  I researched for many days and even considered buying another Bose set.  After looking at CNET reviews (Bose was not listed in the top 10), I decided to buy the Pro Cinema 800 set.  But instead of the 8" subwoofer I bought the 10" subwoofer.  I bought all the speakers seperately (no cost savings buying the package) including my 10" Definitive subwoofer.  The satellites are a lot bigger than the Bose satellites and this helps them reproduce a fuller spectrum of sound.  The sound coming from the Pro 800 are more rich and full.  On the top is a passive radiator that works in tandem with the woofer to help radiate lower frequencies (these speakers are acoustically suspended).  The stand on the bottom is removable and there is an included plug to cover the mounting hole if you are mounting them on wall mounts (each speaker weighs about 4 pounds). The back has binding post connectors with banana conntor receptacle (female).  These speakers definitely out perform my old Bose Acoustimass 10 speaker set and cost about the same. For the money, you can't go wrong with this set.Pros:- High gloss finish- Quality construction- Passive radiator- Rich crisp sound- Included standCons:- Would be nice in documentation to add recommend cross over frequency with sub woofer
$SUMMARY.: Better Than Bose

$REVIEW.: The drive does what you expect: hold lots of files in a tiny form-factor. Not particularly fast, but not slow either. Good, stable thumb drive. Works fine with my car stereo head unit and my DVD player, as well as any laptops/desktops I've tried. The drive does run a bit hot, but that doesn't seem to impair it's function, so no stars removed for that.UPDATE: The drive was left in my pocket and washed/dried, not once, but twice. Once I realized what I'd done, I expected the drive to be toast. Instead, it hasn't missed a beat. Working just as it did the day I got it. Impressive.
$review_summary.: Tiny, with no problems so far - UPDATE: Tough little drive, too

$review_text.: We purchased this to replace a 13 year old JVC cathode ray tube TV with an external digital tuner for digital on-the-air signals and a satellite box attached.  We first tried aPanasonic TC-L39EM60 39-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED HDTVbut it had a less sensitive tuner and some other major problems I describe more in my review of that item.  We next tried this Samsung TV.  Not only did it set up quite easily, but it found nearly twice as many on-the-air stations as the old JVC TV with its external digital tuner did.  Moreover, it has a sharp, brilliant picture that adjusts itself for lighting conditions in the room.  Extremely delighted with this purchase.

$REVIEW.: Case Logic is one of those brands that seem to stick out from others, and for good reason. They build high quality, well thought out products that are both functional and stylish, and then sell them at affordable prices. It's like having your cake and eating it too, and in today's marketplace thats saturated with cheap junk, the Case Logic products are diamonds among the rubble. In this instance, I'm speaking of the Case Logic DCB-303 Vertical Flash Camcorder Case. What an exceptional product this small affordable case is! The case is made of durable, heavy materials, is well padded, zippers that glide open and closed effortlessly, but don't creep open on their own like some cheap ones do, and has both a carrying handle, and a shoulder strap. But the carry options don't stop there, because in addition to that, there is also a belt-loop sewn on the back, which is wide and feels lightly padded, meaning no damage to your belts, and no sagging either. There is a pocket in the main compartment, as well as two side pockets to carry extras in such as spare batteries, microfiber lens cloth, even a mini-notebook. The features and quality are reason enough to love the Case Logic DCB-303, but that's not where it ends. Not only is the case highly functional, but it is very stylish too, with red accents on black fabric, and different textured fabric panels on the main flap. Even the zipper pull tabls are stylish with red accents on black, and a little Case Logic logo molded into each pull to give it some texture for extra grip. This is an excellent product that is likely to see steady use for many years to come.
$SUMMARY.: Small Case, Big Quality

$review_text.: I have just set up our new 321 GS Series II DVD. I concur, the cable jacks want to fall out - but I just bought a better set from Radio Shack and cured that problem. The manual was also confusing - and clearly gives incorrect information regarding set up for best possible video results (leading to a whacked out video with green skies, etc. until I figured out the problem). Two major gripes - the "system" button on the remote is recessed deep into the face of the remote making it difficult to access (maybe they do this on purpose?). And some DVDs, which work just fine in other players, will stop at some point during the program and you get this bogus "can not read disc" error message. The trouble shooting portion of the manual (which is somewhat skimpy) suggests the disc is dirty (not, it is brand new) or defective (again, not, since the movie plays just fine in other players). Don't waste time going to their online customer support and sending them an email -When everything is working correctly, it's an awesome system.

It constantly loses it's connection (no other devices have problems) and the lack of Dual Band Wireless-N is crippling. Even when it does connect it drops the resolution. The navigation is HORRIBLE.

If you are comparing this to the Apple TV I think a major consideration should be that Apple is all about iTunes and paid content providers. On the the hand that means higher quality content but on the other that means fewer choices.  Roku is about harnessing the freedom of the content on the web to play on your TV.

$review_text.: I replaced multiple components in the bedroom with the BDV-E570.  Just a few weeks later, I purchased the BDV-HZ970W and replaced even more components in the living room.  Technology advances have made Home Theater Systems in a Box to be viable solutions as compared to days when I had to purches 4 or 5 components to have this type of performance.  The wireless connectivity and access to various services like Netflix and Pandora make it even better. My only negative is the system is single task and it would be nice to be able to have input from one featur e while accessing another.  For example, play music on Pandora while browsing your Netflix queue.I recommend this item if you want to reduce the number of componets that 5+ year old technology required.

$review_text.: This battery normally costs upwards of over $200 if you get it from Acer or other websites or stores!! Who in their right mind would want to pay THAT for one?!!!I got it from right here today, from Amazon.com!!I was looking to replace the old one because it will no longer hold a charge, and the instant that I try to use the other pc on battery power, it dies and the comput abruptly shuts down!!! That was so annying & aggravating!!!And since I own both the Acer laptop models 4720Z & 4730Z, the battery is interchangable with BOTH pc's! Was originjally going to put this one into the Acer 4720Z, buit instead, I put in in THIS one, the 4720Z and rotated the battery that was in THIS one over to the 4720Z!! Since it is STIL 100% operable and is showing no sign of being drained too fast, like the old battery was.Now BOTH laptop pc's have fully operable batteries!! Even at a fraction of what it normally costs!! Smart buy!!~Daquan13.

There's even separate holders for your cell phone and glasses on the straps which is nice because I have both.The zippers are made very well and are extremely smooth so I feel that they will last a long, along with the straps
There'd even extra compartments for things like water bottles and other things, which would be great if your a new parent.I also feel that if I were to drop/throw this backpack down a steep hill or cliff that the backpack would just laugh at the attempt while it protected everything on the inside

You absolutely must use a custom white balance setting if you use these little lights.  But more importantly I found them to be very, very brite.  So much so, that you really need a dimmer - something which they unfortunately lack.So, if what you need is just a bunch of light and you don't care about quality, then you can get these.

$REVIEW.: I bought one of these chromeboxs for my Dad and a chromebook for my mom.  The main reason I set them up with chrome OS was for more secure online financial transactions.  There is just way to much malware out there for windows for me to feel real comfortable using it for online banking and investing.  The malware problem is especially bad for people like my parents who aren't real sophisticated with keeping windows secure.These are very simple completely hassle free computer solutions.  You basically don't have to have any computer knowledge to use a chrome device, these devices just work.  If you like using google services for documents, email, automatic offsite backup then these devices can be very productive.  If you don't like using google for these services you are kind of just left with a web browsing machine.  One issue people will have is that the only way to print is through cloud printing, so you either need a cloud capable printer or print through a cloud printing enabled windows computer.  Anyways my mom really likes her chromebook and has been using her windows desktop less and less and I like that she doesn't need "tech support" anymore, my dad hasn't used his very much yet.PS - power users are definitely not going to be happy with chrome OS as their only computer setup but it works well as a complimentary device.

$REVIEW.: This camera has inspired me to learn about photography.  It is small and compact and easy to carry around but it has so many features that I just don't know what they all do.  I love taking pictures and I do some scrapbooking.  A good camera has become more important to me since having children and taking up the hobby.  I have discovered some cool things along the way by accident.  (You can change black and white photos to have different shades of black...some have a purple or a blue tint).  So I won't claim to understand everything this camera can do, but it makes a darn nice point and shoot too if you use the default settings.  My husband made the comment 'You'd have to try to take bad pictures with this camera!".  We took pictures at all angles and in all light settings.  We took pictures while we were spinning in a circle or while the kids were skateboarding or riding their bikes past us.  Nearly all the action pictures came out in decent to excellent quality.  The only pictures I have been disappointed in have been those in poor light.  In the house with the flash on, the pictures come out nice unless the subject is extra dark.  We took a picture of our brown dog in the corner of the living room laying on the carpet.  The corner was pretty dark but the carpet is a medium beige.  Even with the flash those pictures came out a little blurry.  When the dog moved out of the corner into a little more light, the pictures were perfect although we still needed the flash.  Does anyone know a way to use this camera and get better pictures inside the house?  There very well could be features to help with this that are above my skill level.  We were disappointed that you can't zoom in further with this camera, yet in our everyday picture taking we haven't been displeased.  Also you have NEVER seen better pictures taken outside.  The quality is amazing.  Using my dog again for an example, you can see each line of his fur and all the different colors that make that fur stands out brilliantly.  The camera is basic and some other reviews have complained about that.  It IS basic, but its so compact and easy to go wherever you go.  That didn't bother us at all.  I wouldn't give this less than a five star rating because even my complaints very well could be because I dont' have the photography know how to correct them.

$review_text.: The one negative reviewer here mentions that replacing the battery voids your warranty


This is amusing
What your warranty will get you on your Kindle is the opportunity to send the old Kindle back and paying money, at least $69 to replace your Kindle with a different Kindle device


So your warranty costs you at least $69 to replace your device


Assuming you purchased a cover for your device you probably spent $25 - $40  for your cover

With your new "warranty" device, you will want to purchase a new cover, right?  So you are in over $100


 This replacement battery cost you about $35 including shipping

Assuming you can use a screwdriver and can do elementary school math, what do you think your warranty is worth, and what is the better deal?The new concept of electronics, customer service, the expansion of the Philippines' call center economy, and "return your device with money in order to keep it working" is a travesty in our culture

 The 21st century model is "Get the inconvenient customer out of the way and let us connect directly to their bank accounts."Replace your battery! It isn't rocket science.

In fact, it does stuff with the TV that the TV's original remote couldn't do like instantly go to a specific video input without having to scroll through all of them. The battery life is great too as it rarely needs recharging. I highly recommend this remote.

$review_text.: OK, so this tiny clip on camera is bundled with all sorts of MSN toys for a pc. Great. But before we hooked it up to my wife's laptop, I plugged it into our Apple laptop and get this: NO stupid loading of extra apps or software: plugged in, went right to iChat and it worked flawlessly!for $99, this is a true sweetheart of a small and strong camera. My daughter immediately confiscated it for her Mac laptop and I waved goodbye... to her girlfriend on the other end.With iChat, a true no-brainer. Newer MacBooks may have a camera, but for all of the rest of us, The microsoft LifeCam works with Skype, iChat and looks like all of the other chat programs. This is a review a few hours into opening the box, so excuse the lack of PC review, but for an Applehead, by far the best camera we've played with: exceptional clarity and again, simple.So highly recommended, I can't tell ya!

$REVIEW.: When this keyboard was announced, I immediately ordered one because of the easy-switch feature which is ingenious! I use the keyboard together with my Retina MacBook Pro (with external display) and Mac Mini (used as a home theatre PC), and switching between the 2 computers literally could not be easier. The backlight is very useful as well since I use it in a dim room at night. The keys are the same chiclet-style ones found on the MacBooks, they don't feel mushy and have a decent travel length. For some weird reason, there is a Play/Pause (F10) key but no FWD/BACK keys which I do sorely miss when I'm using iTunes.The only negative is that the battery life seems to be overrated. I use the keyboard about 2-3 hours per day (mostly with backlight on), and I have to charge it about once a month. Fortunately the keyboard charges via USB so when it's low on power, I just plug it into my USB hub and keep using it without skipping a beat.
$SUMMARY.: Best keyboard I've ever used

$REVIEW.: To get 8GB of this RAM under $100 is a true bargain. No problems with installation or getting machine to post. System recognized right away. From a hardware perspective, check out the size specifications - the heatsink on top was larger than I had anticipated. I had plenty of room, but if you're extremely tight on space, this DIMM is almost twice the height of a normal stick due to the heatsink.Overall, very satisfied. Would buy again.

$REVIEW.: I plugged in three 120mm fans that only draw 0.35 amps each.  The fans sat there twitching, but didn't blow.  I unplugged one and finally they spun, though not at full speed.  The adapter could only power one fan at full speed.  These aren't cheap crappy fans, they are in fact fans made by the same company as this adapter.  There is no reason this device should not work based on its advertised stats, but it doesn't.  I'm returning it and purchasing one from a different manufacturer.

$review_text.: I've owned one of these for a little over a year and the gps works only occasionally.  I had hope to be able to use it for vehicle navigation and geocaching, but never got around to using for geocaching because I did not trust it's reliability.  This is not an acceptable device to rely on for gps and that is why I bought it.  The fact that it is also an external battery was a big bonus and the device worked pretty good for a short while, but I noticed the gps signal would just drop out in the most random locations, well out in the open with no trees or any structures around to block the signal.  I got fed up with it's unreliability after it failed to perform in a city that I wasn't familiar with.  I suspect the fact that the car windshield mount causes the whole unit, including the ipod, to get hot, hotter than I like my electronics to get, possibly shortens the lifespan of the circuitry.  Anyway, I think this was a great idea, but suspect that Dual didn't spec very good components for this device.  As a side note, I have an iPhone 4 that I now use as my iPod and have the same navigation app installed on it and it works just fine, great even, picking up a signal inside my house. Perhaps an unfair comparison, considering the gps in the iPhone is hardwired in, but my advice is if you want an iPod touch with gps, buy a used iPhone instead of an iPod touch and this cradle.  I would like to say it is entirely possible that if you buy this cradle that it could give you years of service, maybe I just got a bad unit, but I just can't recommend it having tried it.  I really wanted this product to succeed.  So sad...

$REVIEW.: This is my first USB3 enclosure, i chose this one out of price ($20 seems fair), Alluminum case (top n bottom are plastic), and read a lot of issues with other enclosures with USB3 cable, specially with the weird mini usb3 (this one uses standard usb3).  Here are my thoughts,Build Quality and AppearanceWasn't expecting much, and really simple aluminum case with top and bottom of plastic, it includes a cheap cloth bag (not using it, bought aCase Logic Compact Portable Hard Drive Case (Black)perfect match), comes with a screw driver to install the hdd.  The aluminum is thick seems like it would stand some weight on it, the plastic seems cheap, but not that bad.  The screws are small but with the screwdriver (included) took less than 5min to have the hdd running.  Overall pleased for $20 i wasn't looking for anything fancy.  Cable is really thick, but has standard USB plug in both sides, not like the new mini usb3, so it seems durable (only time will tell).PerformanceThe enclosure is really good, im getting transfer rates up to 100MB/s on a Nec USB3 port (check the top photos).  I do not get always that speed, depends a lot on the source, even the file matters a lot, some files i get as low as 60MB/s, on average i get 80mg/s (again depends on a lot of things), but way much faster than USB2,.  The case do get warm (not hot), just slightly, but i feel its good as the the heat isnt kept inside the case where it might lower the life your hdd.  Btw the hdd im using isHitachi Travelstar 2.5-Inch 750 GB 5400RPM SATA II 8 MB Cache Internal Hard Drive 0J11563, when it was on my usb2 enclosures it vibrated some and had to use 2 usb2 ports to power it up, but this enclosure only 1 cable and doesn't seem to vibrate much, i cant hear the drive.Recommended for anyone looking for an enclosure for 2.5 laptop hard drive, im even considering buying a couple more to move all my drives to this.One last remark, the amazon pic isn't fully accurate, i though i was going to receive a grey enclosure with silver letters / grey trim and got a gray aluminum enclosure with black line (not grey) and red letters (not silver), the shape n size is the same.  This personally doesn't matter to me, but for some might.

$REVIEW.: I did a ton of research on portable speakers for traveling. I wanted something that could rely on disposable batteries if necessary, because I didn't want to haul around a charger with me, in some cases.Sound quality was also an issue.My impressions of this system:1. First impression out of the box it struck me as cheaply built and flimsy.2. Sound quality is pretty good, I'd say on par with the stock Apple ear buds that come with the Nano. For $114 I'd expect better, though. My friend just bought me a $5 dollar traveling speaker in a zipped up case from Radio Shack that sounds nearly just as good and is pretty damn cool.3. The remote is great and is about the size of a thin pack of gum.4. The carrying case is thin and pretty flimsy,  but it'll keep the system clean, at least.5. Overall, this is a pretty cool product, but I think it's way overpriced. In retrospect I would've liked to have paid about $50 or $60 for it. (The older generation inmotion sells for around there, and sounds just as good, in my opinion.)

$review_text.: I don't run nearly as much as I used to but this has been a great incentive to hit the pavement once more.  A lot of my motivation to run further and faster comes from wanting to out-perform myself, to find my personal best - and in order to do that, you need to be able to measure where you started and how far you have come.In the past, I've used free services like mapmyrun in order to plot out my outdoor runs in advance, determine the exact distance and time myself to figure out my average pace and set a time to beat the next time I ran that same path.  This watch is nice in that you can get much of this information without all of the planning and the software helps you keep track of your progress.One of my concerns about this sports watch was its size as I have extremely tiny wrists that are too small for standard watches.  This watch has rungs that go nearly all the way round, so although it's somewhat wide, it will fit even the smallest arm.One downside is that the GPS doesn't always work and I don't know what the conditions are that affect it.  In order to continue tracking your pace, you need that Nike+ shoe insert of which I have no interest in purchasing at this time.  It's not perfect but it's pretty darned good and I still like it.

$REVIEW.: I've bought two of these in the past month, one for me and one for my wife.  The first one was bad and was replaced under warranty.  The warranty unit works fine.  I've had no real issues with either unit and am happy with the purchases.  I did plug my unit into a FlexSmart X3 and got no usable audio, just thumping and distorted noise.  I've not tried it again to see if it works correctly this time, so I can't say for sure if the issue is with the Sansa or the X3.  Generally, though, I've been happy with the Sansas I bought.
$review_summary.: Amazing little player

$review_text.: Cons:I have owned many HP laptops in my day. It just ends up happening. I do not like that they put in a bunch of HP software that I never use and perpetually gets in my way. Also, the first unit I purchased had some weird glitch where every 65 second the DVD drive would pop open. However, now that I have a working one I like it so much I felt the need to review it. Also, this computer is trying really hard to be an Apple product. It's silver shell and black back lit keyboard echo that of a Macbook. However, it is light and feels like a cheaper version of the apple product. Finally, there is a movement to change the design of the arrow keys so that left and right buttons are full sized but up and down buttons are half sized. I use these buttons all the time and the half sized buttons are annoying.So enough of the negatives. What are the things that make this a four star product?1. It is a cheaper product. It costs over 50% less than an apple product. I love the price. And I think for what is paid the laptop offers a lot.2. Backlit keyboard. It is a perk I have been waiting for. they seems to usually be reserved for ultrabooks. It is nice to see the price point drop on this feature.3. I am not much of a computer "guts" kind of guy. I just want the computer to do what I want it to. I do not need to know all the inside stuff. I do know that the audio quality is good and I am able to run my PC games well on it without issue. I have heard reviews saying the screen is cheap but I have no complaints. It is higher quality than the laptop it replaced and for that i am grateful. I do not think the average user will feel cheated when it comes to the display quality.Overall, I just like it. It works well and I feel comfortable using it.

$REVIEW.: I got the Nuvi 880 for my new vehicle

 I decided that off-the-shelf solution was cheaper than factory installed
 In my previous car (a Mazda3) I was using the factory installed navigation system.I got the Nuvi 880 primarily for the voice recognition feature.I find though that my Mazda navigation was smarter and more user-friendly than the Nuvi 880, even though it didn't have voice recognition.VR works well

 You need to turn down the radio though so that it can understand you

 There is a small library of words that it understands


 But for me, VR is well worth it because the unit is placed well forward of the dash, out of reach for me


 One gripe though is that when you ask to spell the location or category, it gives you a keyboard to type, and you can't 'say' the letters

 That is really annoying for a unit that's supposed to be accessible via the voice commands.The MSN feature is ok


 You can get weather info, movie times, and traffic updates
 Though I don't think I will be continuing after the free subscription period expires.One thing to note is that there is an annoying 'clicking' sound after you pair the unit with a bluetooth phone


 Don't know how to get rid of it.Another thing I don't like about the 880 is that it's not as smart as my previous nav system
 For example, I recently entered a request to go to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor in Jackson, NJ from Rockland County (NY)


 The google route takes you down the Garden State Parkyway, to I95, then to I195


 Highway all the way, for a total trip time of 92.1 mi - about 1 hour 41 mins

 The 880 decided to make the route: GSP to RT9 thru Freehold NJ then to Monmouth Rd

 The trip distance is definitely shorter 80.0 mi, but it was a much longer trip time with all the stop lights I had to go through
 When I realized the error, there was no way to get back to the highway


 I wish there was a way to program the route like my old nav system (eg., stay on highways, etc).

$REVIEW.: I've had many of these radios from different manufacturers over the years & this set is the best deal. The range on any of these units is never as good as advertised, but we know that when we buy them, don't we?I favor Motorola over others due to portability, durability, and (this sounds trivial) the "clip" that locks it to your gear.  The clip system allows a "quick disconnect" of the unit while leaving the clip itself in place on your fishing vest (in my case)while charging the radio.  The battery life (3 AAA) on this particular unit is just ok & is shorter than the AA models I've used, especially the longer distance models.I like the USB charging port that can allow charging from any USB port, whether on a computer or using my in-car USB charger for my cell phone.  Definitely get this particular package which comes with both the desk charger and the rechargeable battery packs.

$review_text.: It fits my MacBook Air 13&#34; perfectly, and I mean, PERFECTLY.  It is the exact same width as the screen, and looks as if it was designed specifically for the MacBook Air.  The cord is just long enough for the USB plug on either side, without being too long.  Cord storage built into the speaker.  Travelling case is a nice extra touch.Sound: yes, it sounds amazing, considering its compact design, and being only USB powered.  Equivalent to a pair of good computer speakers.  Mid and bass output is more than expected for its size.  Though while bass is omnidirectional, treble is not.  You can't escape the physics of design for pointing the speakers to the side.  And this is why I took away one star, even though I really want to give it a 5.  The sound is not as 360 degrees as it claims..Sometimes I like to watch movies on my laptop in bed.  Sound on action scenes are great, but when it comes to dialogue, I find that speeches can be muddy/muffled.  Sometimes I have to turn the volume up because I have a hard time hearing dialogue scenes, and turn it back down for action scenes.  If I cup an ear shape with my hands and direct the sound forward, treble opens up, and I can hear the dialogue better without turning the volume up.I'm also being really picky with this review.  This is the best-designed laptop speakers on the market.  I purchased this a while ago at $30, and it's now selling for almost $80 - in which the supply and demand of this price increase is a testament of how good this product is.

$REVIEW.: I have bought this for my macbook pro 2.4 quad. I recently purchased an adapter for hooking my mac to a 32 inch NEC monitor. I hook up the monitor then close my laptop to work from the NEC exclusively. The first day I did this my Mac got so hot that it was freezing up and you couldn't even move the mouse. After purchasing this I have not had that problem. It still gets a little hot because of closing the Macbook but it hasn't froze up since getting this fan. The fan is very sturdy and well built and runs super quiet. It does a great job of keeping my mac cool under normal circumstances but when I close the macbook to use with the NEC it does enough to keep it from overheating but I am looking into possibly another small fan to point at the one area that is very hot. I am very satisfied with this product and will purchase more from Thermaltake in the future. I highly recommend this product for normal use and gaming for sure!

$review_text.: I got this clock radio/iPhone dock as a Christmas present and overall, I give it a &#34;meh&#34; rating.First the good - the sound is pretty great for such a small package


 I'm able to pick up both FM & AM radio without issue at all

 The sound is crisp and loud enough to fill the bedroom
 The bass response is also pretty decent - with the option of adding Sony's &#34;Megabass&#34; for a little more oomph

 Also, it charges my iPhone 5S without issue


 For that, I like it.Now for the bad - there is VERY little customization when it comes to the alarm
 You can wake up to the standard buzzer, the radio, or the iPhone
 I'm the type of person who likes to wake up to a different song each day
 On my old Philips iPhone dock, I was able to create a playlist specifically for the dock, and the songs would shuffle with each day
 It was a great feature.With this dock, you MUST have the music app going in order to wake to the iPhone

 Otherwise, it just defaults to the buzzer
 Quite the unpleasant surprise if you forget to get the app going before you dock your phone

 It's an annoyance, for sure
 I always have to make sure the app is launched before I go to bed

 The second major annoyance is that you have to set the app to whatever song you want to wake up to

 You can't just select a playlist - you have to have a song queued up
 This may seem like something minor to a lot of people, but it's 2014


 There is no reason I shouldn't be able to wake up to a shuffled playlist.One option is to download Sony's app for your phone
 It is a completely non-intuitive app and, just like with the music app, you have to have it running in the background in order for your dock to take advantage of its features

 (If you're looking for it in the app store - search for &#34;D-Sappli&#34; - I know, it's just as intuitive as the app itself...)  This app does add some features, but unlike with the regular music app, you can't just have it running in the background
 The app has to be launched and front and center in order to use it
 This means your iPhone screen will be on in the middle of the night - you can't put the phone to sleep while using this app.All in all, if you're looking for an extremely BASIC iPhone clock radio/dock, this is not an awful option

 I would argue that it's a little overpriced for what it offers, though


 For the same functionality, you can get something at half the price from a competing company

 If you're looking for the latest and greatest - with the most current features, look elsewhere...

$review_text.: I mounted an Epson EX71 to my basement ceiling with this product. Here are the Pros and Cons I found:Pros:** Reasonably priced** Flexible mounting arms** Easy to assemble / install... two-piece design.Cons:** The adjustment for aiming works poorly.** The mounting arms are not sturdy so your projector may move.** The mounting hardware is extensive, but way over-sized.To fasten into my ceiling trusses, I used a much smaller set of bolts and washers. The large lag bolts are way too big for 2&#34; trussing and are complete over-kill. I still can't get the aiming mechanism to work reliably; the tightening bolt just spins inside the housing. Ending up spacer-ing the mount to tilt. Then took the mount apart to tweak it into position.I would recommend shopping around. I initially purchased this unit because the Epson EX71 has very odd mounting points and the mounting arms on this unit were flexible enough to attach to the EX71. It isn't that this product is really poor quality. It's just not well thought out and could use extra strength.

$REVIEW.: My Panasonic Lumix GX1 (M4/3) is small and slippery so I figured a strap around my hand was a good idea in case I got butterfingered. The AH-N1000 leather strap strikes a middle ground between cheap nylon string straps and expensive yuppie straps like Tap & Dye. The leather is soft, well finished, attractive and not bulky. And it's long enough to hook on my wrist or twist around my hand. I don't recommend regularly dangling/swinging your camera from this strap: the metal camera strap lug may wear through the lightweight leather after repeated stress or rough use. Use it as a safely leash. If you plan to swing and tangle your camera, consider a beefy military grade strap like theBlack Rapid Wrist Strap with FastenR FR-3.Installation was harder than I imagined and I struggled with it for a good 5 minutes. Why? The AH-N1000 is a single buckle design and, after looping through camera lug, you thread the strap through the buckle a second time to secure it. I had to bust out the tweezers for the second pull through!All in all a fine lightweight leather strap: complements my black GX1, not too light or too bulky and just right for twisting around my hand. And what a deal for only $10!

$REVIEW.: I've never been big on Bluetooth headsets.  Each time I get one, I never use it.  The last one I had is stored away somewhere and probably wouldn't hold a charge by now if I did try to use it.  Ever since getting this one, I've found that I hate holding the phone to my ear and grab my headset when I'm going to make or receive a call.  I'm not about to wear the thing constantly, as I don't use the phone that often, but this is comfortable enough that I find after calls, I end up leaving it on for awhile, barely noticing I still have it on.  About my only complaint about the device is that the small flexible plastic piece that goes around your ear, twists and bends so easily, it can sometimes be difficult to slip it on with one hand, but I'm getting better at it.

$review_text.: I travel often to Europe, and in the past have always had hard time finding a proper power converter to help me use my electronic devices over there


However, I've finally figured out two things: 1


All those cheap power converters that you come across really don't work

A true power converter would be too bulky and too heavy to carry around, especially on a plane
2
Most of the modern electronic devices don't need power/voltage conversion
They work perfectly well with both the US and European voltages

So what you really need is a plug adapter.This Satechi adapter seems to work reasonably well
It can adapt to the plugs and devices from the US, UK, Europe, and Australia
In that respect it's pretty universal
It also has a USB charger plug, which is an additional bonus since we are increasingly reliant on all of our small USB-charging devices.The adapter is very well designed and built

It seems sturdy enough to withstand repeated handling and vicissitudes of international travel


It is fairly compact, and its cubic shape makes it very easy to store.The most distinguishing feature of this adapter is, of course, the fact that it houses a fully functioning WiFi router
The router enables you to connect to an Ethernet cable and convert the wired Internet connection to a wireless one
This is particularly convenient when you are traveling and don't have an access to a readily available wireless networking

The router is easy to setup and use, even for people with limited networking skills

It is still a very powerful and highly customizable router, and it offers a wide variety of networking functionality
It can, for instance, be used to setup a private ad-hoc intranet, which may come in handy when privacy concerns are important for a small working group

I also wish that it enabled a networked storage access, something that could in principle be easy to setup with the available USB port
This feature would probably of use to power users, but could also be utilized as a family media server.Overall, this is a very thoughtfully designed voltage adapter/travel router that could really be of use to frequent international travelers.

$REVIEW.: Using this system was an easy way to add speakers to another room without undertaking a major science project to fish wires through walls (been there, done that). The quality of the sound won't be mistaken for your Bose or home theater system, however, for my situation it is more than adequate. I simply wanted the same music to be playing in various rooms at the same time - mostly background music when entertaining in the living room or working in the kitchen. Initially, I added some Bose cube speakers that I picked up on eBay to this system to get the best sound possible. However, I tried swapping them out for some Samsung speakers from an older home theater surround sound system I had boxed up in my attic. There was no noticeable difference in sound quality. The moral of that story is to just use whatever speakers you have lying around or can pick up cheaply.Another note to consider - I contacted the manufacturer directly to see if more than one of these could be used simultaneously with a stereo system. I was told that 2 of these units can be used at the same time without a degradation in sound quality. In fact, since the system uses just one frequency to transmit a signal to the receiver, you really only require one transmitter installed at the stereo along with a separate receiver for each room where you want to install a pair of speakers.With that in mind and because I couldn't order just the receiver portion from Amazon, I ordered just a second receiver from the manufacturer. Although a seemingly logical solution, it turned out to be a disaster! For just half of a complete system, they charged more than the entire system that was available via Amazon. In addition, it came without the necessary AC power adapter. That would cost an additional $50+! In frustration, I returned those things to the manufacturer and simply purchased a second (complete) system from Amazon. I just didn't need the second transmitter so that went into my 'magical spare electronic parts' box that we all have in somewhere in our homes.

$review_text.: My Mac Mini is upstairs, my router is downstairs. I was getting signal strength of a paltry 11 and then it started going down even more, I didn't even get one bar on Airport. I was so frustrated.I bought this product with the regular antenna and immediately got 65-75. I believe the problem is that the Mac Mini has an omnidirectional antenna and we have loads of internet connections in our neighborhood. I think this was interfering with my connection. The antenna that comes on this product is *directional* and when you get it pointed right (trial and error worked for me), you don't get nearly as much interference.In addition to this, I finally gave up and moved my router downstairs about 12 feet, which put it roughly 4 feet from the middle beam of the house (it had been on an exterior wall). This bumped up my wifi signal to 100 using the bearextender.The product is a 5 minute installation, and well worth the money. I opted for their longer USB cable on the antenna so that I could position it closer to the router. And their customer support is really excellent. I definitely recommend this product.Tip: If you're using a Mac Mini, you may be happier with the original antenna, because the regular antenna is directional, which can help to block out interfering signals. The upgraded antenna is omnidirectional, which might let in more interference.

$REVIEW.: Needed a microphone shock-mount for my new Panasonic GH 3 camera to hold an Audio-Technica ATR6550 shotgun mic


Saw this one on Amazon -- reviews were positive -- so I bought it
 Note: Amazon listed others at a lesser cost, but I'm a believer in "you get what you pay for." This is one sturdy unit!It fastens easily on the hot-shoe of the camera, insulating the microphone from sounds created when hands move about on the camera body

Or it easily mounts to an auxiliary side-bracket, which distances it from the camera even further (in the event your are concerned about motor noise from zoom lenses).The heavy-duty rubber bands -- which are criss-crossed on the front and rear of the holder -- seem sturdy

It took somewhat of an initial effort to push the ATR6550 through the opening, but after doing so the bands held the microphone firmly in place.I hope to get many hours of use from this microphone holder

(May order another one for my Canon D60.)

The Kinivo, although not as "loud" has lasted, the iHome mini speaker just quit making noise

It is on and I can connect another speaker through it and get that speaker to work
I guess now there are 18 "1 star ratings" with the same problem

Either it is too loud and rattles the connection loose or it is just poor QC at the factory

If you do buy this buy another as a back-up as they are too inexpensive to fix.

$review_text.: The first time you pick these speakers up, you can feel the solid construction.  So many desktop speakers are flimsy and provide very noisy and muffled sound with at best marginal quality.  The designers of these speakers aimed at building a high end sound in a fairly small package, namely one that can fit near a computer in either your home or work office.  But, since these speakers are bluetooth capable, you can put them just about any place where you can plug them into an outlet.  This is a decided advantage over the more traditional amp plus speaker combination.Make sure that you check the size of the speakers to determine if they fit into where you want your music.  They are slightly bigger than conventional desktop speakers, but not nearly as big as the once popular Bose &#34;small&#34; speakers.  As an owner of 2 different pairs of Bose speakers, the sound quality is comparable but in a much lower volume and footprint.  I've tested the speakers with several different types of music: alternate/Indy rock (i.e. Mumford and Sons), classic rock, and finally classical.  Typically, classical is the most demanding because of the range of frequency content in the music.  In this case, the music was fabulous, but I will warn you that with speakers of this quality, the format of the music starts become the limiting factor.  Because most streamed music content is compressed to save space, there is loss that occurs and generally hits the higher frequencies.  You may still experience this problem if you choose to stream music and not drive the music using the line in option of the speaker.Overall, the designers (and manufacturers) of these speakers did a very nice job.  They avoided sources of noise and distortion (probably using good design practice combined with decent internal parts and components).  I won't really comment on price because at this price, it really is up to the purchaser to determine how much they want to push the quality of their listening experiencing.  These definitely are decided improvement over the &#34;less than 100 dollars&#34; type speakers because they produce a higher quality sound at a greater amplification.  In my book, this is important and I'm most delighted that it came with Bluetooth so I could play my music remotely from my tablet.  I should also comment that the setup was super easy with the bluetooth working flawlessly.  Some problems can occur but they're mainly related to the quality of the sending source, so if you're trying to send music from something like a low end phone, I'm not sure how well it will work.  The controls are on top of the speaker for easy access, but they also include a small remote with all the cables that you'll need.  Definitely a sign of legitimate run at a high end speaker.
$SUMMARY.: Great for the music listener who wants greater quality from a fairly small speaker pair!

$review_text.: These cameras are a good value

 I use them along with an app on my iPhone 4s that I bought for $5
 I can monitor my home wherever I have cell phone signal
 I can remotely pan and tilt the cameras, and I can see fine whether it's dark or light at home.The sound coming from the cameras back to my iPhone app is tinny, but that's what you'd expect
 It's nice to be able to hear along with seeing what's happening.It was a bit of a pain in the butt configuring the cameras to work through my wireless router, but once I figured it out, it's great


 Since I only had one jack remaining open on the router, it was nice that these cameras operate wirelessly
 The video feed is faster and more responsive when you wire it, of course, since wi-fi isn't as fast as Ethernet.

$REVIEW.: The case is fairly pretty, but...1.) You have to put the drives into the bays backwards from what I'm used to for them to fit.  I.e. the plugs must face the back of the case.  Not a big deal, but its confusing)2.) The side panel wiring harness (under the motherboard) doesn't have enough space. There are full-size power connectors that must be hooked up for fans/front panel, but channels aren't deep enough for a standard power supply cable without it rubbing. Would be very easy to rip a wire closing the case up.  Inspected my wiring when I had problems, but I didn't see any evidence that I had.3.) Plastic tool-free latches break very easily on the expansion card hold downs. On the bright side, they give you extras.But, the real problem:System would randomly turn itself off. Not sure why.  Pulled all the same parts out (power supply, motherboard, cpu, ram, optical drive, hard drive, video) and put them in the case I had been upgrading from, and everything worked fine again. My wiring was pretty clean - didn't see anything that would have obstructed the fans.  Anyway, wasted too much time to spend much more troubleshooting this thing.

$REVIEW.: This is one of those products that you will either love or hate.  If you like your iphone 5 in an armored case or don't mind bulk and weight then this might be perfect for you.  If you like your iphone being as close to naked as possible this will not be for you.  I am kind of in-between, I am willing to put up with bulk if it serves a purpose and is not too much of a take away from the phones size, weight and looks.Let me start off by saying the Duracell Powermat works and it works well!But!The first thing that really bugs me is that Gap at the bottom of the case and the fact that it's just left open!  On day one two people at work asked me what happened to my phone did I drop it and break off the bottom.  That's what happens when you have a copper clad connector out in the open, it looks like a part of the phones internal circuit.  Is it Duracell's attempt to put a Duracell battery look on the Iphone?  Maybe but it just does not work for me.  Also it makes my phone 5/16" longer and just leaves a gaping hole on front panel.  What Duracell should have done is use a black plastic cover to fill in that gap and hide the copper colored plastic connector.The second issue I have is Weight. The naked Iphone 5 weighs in at 4.04 Oz and the Duracell cover pack brings up that weight to 7.55 Oz.  Now I know a battery pack has got to weigh a lot but it's almost double the weight and that's just adding in a battery that's about the same capacity as the one that built into the phone already.  I can live with the weight but it would have been nicer if they could have trimmed it down a bit.The third issue is the USB plug and cover.The Duracell unit has a copper colored cover over the usb charging port that just frustrates the heck out of me.  Every time I open it with my finger nail the cover comes up, my nail slides off and the spring latch closes back.  I found I had to open it ever so carefully and position my fingers in a way that a second finger catches and holds the door as soon as it opens.As I stated before it adds 5/16" more to the phone length and it also adds about 4/16" in extra thickness. it basically doubles the thickness of the phone,  that's ok, its something I would expect with a battery pack and inductive charge coil combo.Inductive charging:  Well it work fine with my Duracell charging pad, and that makes the USB plug cover a little bit less of a pain but if you don't have an inductive charging pad be aware that the little door takes a few tries to get it open.Protection:  As a protective case it basically just a slider case.  About the best protection it will offer is that I imagine that in almost all drop cases your phone will land on the Back because the weight of the extra battery should guarantee that.  As for the durability of the case, it feels pretty kind of Ehhhhh.  It's ok but it has very little grip to it and the back battery is held on by three little L-clips, it's almost certain to be flying off if the phone drops, but as I said before the extra weight pretty much guarantees a drop that lands on the back, so better the battery gets damaged than your phone.Overall I gave it three stars because it works, it does what it says it does and a press of a button on the pack does double the life of your Iphone 5's battery so yes it's a good product, but it could have been so much better if Duracell had just covered the front hole and made a simpler USB charging port, I keep wondering why they ever bothered to cover the usb port, maybe to keep out the stray magnetic fields from the inductive charging?  Anyway if your looking for a battery pack and inductive charging combo this is probably the best you can get from the limited choices available.

$REVIEW.: Advertised as a Front Seat Organizer for creating a close-at-hand mobile office, I thought this was the perfect bag for me since I'm "on the road" about 1x/mo.Made out of nylon with a polyurethane lining, the bag/tote has a rigid bottom (wire-lined) that folds down to give the bag stability and has 2 inner full-size pockets, one of which is padded & designed for a laptop (I use a 10" netbook)

 There is also a divided outer pocket (not full-size) that is meant to accommodate pens, small pads, a phone, an mp3 player & a navigation device.The product packaging indicates that the front seat organizer dimensions are 11.2" x 23.4" x 8.9"; however, my organizer measures out at 11" x 14.5"x 7.25" (as pictured)

 To get the 23.4" dimension, you'd have to stretch out the top of the bag, which is not practical.Since I normally carry files, I would have like to see an option for a wire rod upon which to place hanging folders (the interior will accommodate legal size hanging files, but since the sides are not rigid, the metal hangers on the files tend fall off the sides


 Note that if you have enough files, this is just a minor irritation since the files will support themselves because of the bulk


 My comparison is a rigid plastic file box that I have used for 4 years -Oxford 41742 Portafilet Letter Size Hanging File Box, 13-7/8w x 11-1/8d x 10-7/8h, Black.Overall, this is a very nice bag/tote, and should hold up to the wear & tear that comes with taking bags in & out of a car
 The packaging indicates "25 Years Quality Guarantee", but I'm not quite sure if this means the product is guaranteed for 25 years.5 Stars for Aesthetics & Craftsmanship

 3 Stars because of not having the option of rigid sides to fit hanging files.Made in China.

This is that value SSD that will make the difference.I popped the guy out of the box and was happy to feel it's quality casing. I saw the pictures, and it was a dull grey looking block of cheap looking plastic- but once it was in my hands, I was actually amazed- good quality! It rivals the Corsair SSD I bought last year, and this is cheap!I bought the smallest size possible as this is purely a boot drive. It hosts a few applications and things, but no large stuff. That's all on my WD 3tb hard drives...If I was building anything other than a gaming PC, I would buy this SSD. This is a great buy and seems to work well- I can't say much for performance against the rest of the market- but what I will say is it will give you faster speeds than any mechanical drive will, for a great value price compared to the rest of the SSD market. I am happy with my purchase!

$review_text.: Originally purchased this backpack for less than forty dollars


I feel it is well worth it at that price

But by the time I&#8217;m writing this review its selling for over one-hundred somehow


If you're eyeballing this in the hundred dollar range please look somewhere else as its nowhere near that quality.I purchased this because my old Samsonite backpack that had survived 2 years of high school and 5 years of college was finally to beaten up and needed to be put to rest before starting my masters classes


I bought this right before a trip to Florida, and for the money I spent it has held up well to travel with/ daily abuse from books/laptop.I have a 15&#34; laptop so I don&#8217;t have much to say about it not fitting 17&#34; however I could see that my 15&#34; is pushing it
As the other reviewer pointed out TSA will still make you pull the laptop out every time (even in less strict non-major airports I&#8217;ve had to)
So if you&#8217;re interested in that please look else ware (though I don't know of one where they wouldn't make you remove it).The straps are A LOT less padded than my old Samsonite and they seem like they will break well before the rest of the backpack.I am not one to carry a lot of small items so the pockets suit my needs more than enough however as the other reviewers have stated there aren't a lot of small pockets.TL;DR - If it&#8217;s on sale for 67% off it&#8217;s a good buy and a worthwhile backpack

$review_text.: My local cable company decided to start charging a monthly rental on their cable modem
Installation was just plug in and call

You need to call your cable company and give them the modem MAC address for them to activate it on their network
This modem will pay for its self in a year.

$review_text.: I had an iRock! Model 400 for a long time, and it worked GREAT
 It worked for the 30 feet as advertised, and then some, and reception was stable.My father wanted one, and I found that suddenly I couldnt find the iRock! in stores near me anymore, so I bought this Belkin

 It didnt work as well


 In fact, it barely worked at all


 If you move the unit 4 feet from the radio--any radio, the signal becomes pathetic.My iRock! finally crapped out, so I bought a Belkin, model up from this one
 I threw it in the trash moments ago, after I brought in the house to run some tests


 Using the signal strength meter on my Pioneer TX-9800 tuner, I was only able to get a signal strength of ONE out of 5, WITH THE UNIT PLACED DIRECTLY OVER THE TUNING CAPACITOR
 As in 2 inches away.It did marginally better when I hooked it up to a 9V battery instead of the 3V it normally runs on
 I thought about hooking two deep cycle batteries up in series and throwing 24V at it to see if it either worked well or fried like bacon, but figured that walking around with two car batteries kind of ruins the portability factor.My father's unit doesnt work at all any more.This thing stinks


 Get a better one, and avoid the Belkins, they are junk.

$review_text.: so far so good.  about an hour of use, my rating may change. a few tips. I wanted to buy this camera through amazon because I really like how they ship, BUT they do not take pay pal (they should) so I decided to go with one call via eBay for 999.00, no state sales tax. I am from NY and the taxes  here are outrageous. I sold my canon 5dmark ii to get this camera, I also have a t3i.I love the speed of this camera shooting jpeg with a fast sd card , that's right you should  have a fast card (80 mb's will do) for this camera especially shooing RAW (lab tests later) video tracking was decent with my 28-105mm canon lens. tracking will vary do to lens speed and shooting conditions. being a videographer for many years DSLR'S  have a way to go to match pro-Sumer video cameras.this camera feels good in my small hand and the weight is just right. I  am not a big fan of touch screen operation because the screen gets smudged in a hurry, being anal retentive/ a clean freak this gets annoying to me but I will make the best of it.* always put a screen shield on this camera ASAP you'll be glad you did.the 3 main reasons I sold my 5D mark ii was it didn't have a swivel screen , I love the swivel screen, its a must for video shooting. the on camera flash. I have an external speed light/flash I just really never find myself using it. I feel I have most shooting situations covered with the on camera flash although it has its drawbacks. camera 7 FPS is awesome + 20 MP is pretty cool.one problem I did encounter is the battery charger. I put the dead battery that came with the camera on the charger and left it to charge thinking nothing of it.4 hours later I see the battery still blinking rapidly ....ooops I guess I should read the directions. the directions state if the red blinking light flashes rapidly its not charging . its not charging ? I have never heard of this.why is there a communication problem between a new battery and the battery charger?...following the directions I separated the battery from the charger and put it back on....still blinking rapidly.....repeated this action again and finally the battery started to charge. NOT COOL.I have 2 after market batteries that would no charge on this charger .Bummer I then ordered an aftermarket charger for 5 $ no big deal. keep in mind that this battery charger is the same battery charger that comes with the 5dmark ii 7D and a few other models. I should be able to charge after market batteries on this charger.sample picture from my sigma 170-500mm on auto where beautiful.l this camera raised the level of usefulness on this sometimes tricky to use lens. The in camera aberration and ISO reduction really works. I will update after I put this camera through a more rugged workout .

bottom line on this set is the outstanding picture

Even my hidef cable service blows me away and on Blu-ray it's a killer

I know I paid top dollar for a new model but using coupon code WS920X5750 at exponj saved me $272.64 ! If you have been setting on the fence check out the UN46C7000 and you'll be off that fence as fast as I was.Cons: Price, internet tv, too many bells and whistles

Setup was a snap - got it hooked to the TV, on our wireless and linked to our Netflix and Amazon accounts in no time.  Great picture quality and a nice clean interface.  Installed Plex media server on our PC so we could stream videos from the hard drive there, that works exceptionally well (automatically loads movie posters and metadata for the movies and TV shows).  Will be picking up a second one soon to use in the living room instead of the PS3 for streaming.

I'd say $20 is exactly the right price for this case.THE GOOD:* It protects the front and rear of the iPad well.* Easy to clip on* The iPad wakes up when the case is opened, and sleeps when the case is closed.THE BAD:* It feels cheap. Certainly the hinge feels flimsy, and I am expecting it to tear sometime soon.* Why is there a Verbatim logo on this case? It's not a Verbatim iPad.THE UGLY:* The clamshell back adds significant weight to a device that is designed to be ultra-light.* As a stand, this is useless. It's stiff, and likes to unfold. The choice of a three-panel back means there's no flexibility in the angles available.SUMMARYA cheap case that will protect your iPad Mini, but it feels flimsy and weighs a lot.

It has different map view options and the display is clear.  Touch screen is nice and the menus are easy to browse thru.  lots of POI. I found starbucks in different towns and it displays phone # too.  great storage space, 5 gigs allocated to music and video.  SD card is detected easily and lets you increase the memory.  its a little heavy and thick too, but so are some of the TOMTOM and GARMIN devices.  overall and a great value for what I paid.  I read on CNET that people had problems with this device and I did some more reading about it. JVC has a firmware update that fixes most of the problems. however, I havent had any problems so I havent updated my firmware.

Going from a high DPI mouse to this one, you will notice a difference, but it's plenty good enough for anything other than professional gaming (I'm still kicking butt in Quake Live with it..). Form is great. Size is great. Clicks feel good. Wheel feels good. Like others mentioned, it is significantly lighter than most normal-sized mice, but you get used to it quickly and it's actually kind of nice. Takes much less effort to move it around, which makes for less fatigue over long periods. Definitely recommend. It's GREAT for everything except applications that require very high DPI (such as pro gaming or pro photoshop).

$review_text.: This review is for the Samsung UN26EH4000 LED TelevisionSAMSUNG UN26EH4000----------------------- BLACKS: Excellent blacks, night sky in background looks good.- PICTURE:  This is 720p (not 1080p), some say it doesn't matter at this size, others say 1080p helps at this size.  I'm trying to find a setting giving me better texture and color accuracy.  Note that if you are after a bright look and can't raise "brightness" more without ruining the look you are after, consider raising Contrast up and choosing Dynamic for picture mode.- VIEWING ANGLE:  While there are color issues as you move further off-center the picture doesn't fall apart and become unviewable, you can still see the picture, which isn't always the case with smaller TVs.- NO HEADPHONE JACK: No headphone jack (where you plug headphone in and the sound only comes out through headphones).  The line out doesn't take headphone line jack.  Can't imagine why a smaller TV like this wouldn't come with a headphone jack.- SOUND:  Compared to many others I've tested at stores the built-in audio is okay, however if quality sound is important expect to get an external speaker set of some kind (sound bar, ZVOX 220, Bose Solo, etc).- IN:  Has 2 HDMI, 1 Component (Y/G/B/R/W), 1 RF Cable/Antennae- CONTROLS:  Once you learn to operate the single joystick button under the TV you're fine, some folks might take some time getting used to the lack of explicit buttons.  For example holding the button in gets rid of the control overlay on the screen.  Of course there is always the remote that comes with it.

$REVIEW.: I am someone who does not believe in combo devices. For instance, I generally believe if you buy a printer that scans, you have a device that neither prints nor scans well. This is definitely a combo device. If you are torn between a laptop and a tablet, there are definitely some advantages to this device.- It is fast for tablet.- The touch screen is responsive.- The screen is of good quality.- You can use some PC programs, such as the included Microsoft Office, and even play the PC version of Minecraft.- It is lightweight and portable.What to consider if you are in the market for a laptop:- The screen size is only 10&#34;. While this might be great for a road warrior, I find using a laptop with a screen this small somewhat awkward. You could also argue that a smaller screen uses less battery life and is better for travel.- For the price, you could have a laptop with a larger screen, a DVD drive, a larger hard drive, faster processor, and more RAM. In other words, you have chosen to sacrifice speed for portability.- The keyboard is surprisingly good, if slightly stiff, for a sub-standard sized keyboard.- The trackpad is terribly stiff, even after many hours of use. I only use it in laptop mode if I have a mouse plugged into it.What to consider if you are in the market for a tablet:- This looks less slick than other tablets of this size in this price range.- You are using a full version of Windows 8.x. At this time, the Windows app store is frustratingly small. If you plan to use this as a tablet, please take a look at the apps available for Windows. Hopefully the market place will grow by leaps and bounds, but right now there isn't much there. Obviously you will not be able to utilize apps available from Google Play.Overall, I am delighted with the speed of this device, especially considering the hardware it is sporting. I have not had any issues with speed. The Windows 8 learning curve is definitely high at first, but that is not the fault of this device and will be a problem with any full Windows bases touch screen device you purchase.The packaging is lovely and reminds me of higher end products. The inclusion of a USB drive is a nice touch. The lousy mouse is terrible enough to be warrant 4 stars instead of 5.

$REVIEW.: I had an Ipaq 3150 before this unit.  That unit was a replacement for my Palm IIIXE.  Each time I have changed my Handheld, it has been a step up.  Now, going to the 3650 has been a giant step forward.The color screen is great.  It is well lit, easy to read.  The programs that come with the unit halp me keep myself organized at home or on the road.  I already used Microsoft Outlook to organize everything while at my desk.  The Activesync software that comes with the Ipaq automatically found all my appointment, calendars, and contacts and put them into my Ipaq for me.Sure, it only has 32mb of storage.  But I have hundreds of contacts, 40-60 eamails per day, and I subscribe to Avantgo for offline web broiwsing and I never get near the maximum.If I want to store some music files, I just add a 64mb Compact Flash card and I have plenty of space.  That 64mb card can store about 2 and a half albums when compressed into WMA format.  I use my Ipaq on planes as a music player similar to an MP3 player (Can't call it an MP3 player if I use WMA files, can I?)  All I do is hook up my headphones, turn on the media player (Included with PocketPC software), and put the player in my breast pocket.The only thing I would like to see is longer battery life.  I regularly travel and after 8-10 hours of continuous use, I have to recharge it.One accessory I would recommend....I picked up a USB Sync cable that also recharges the battery from your USB port.  It's great when on the road...one cable both charges and syncs up the Ipaq...

$REVIEW.: The technology in these projectors gets better all the time - I've compared four projectors I've received over the last two years for review and this is leagues ahead of the other 3 (2 of which were Epson)


For home or office use, this is one of the best devices on the market in terms of brightness, clarity and ease of set up.For home usage, I tested a movie using the projector against a painted light wall and the result was extraordinary, with extremely crisp lines, dark blacks and bright whites even without a pre-made screen


The fan is noisier than previous models but once movie audio is playing, it's not really noticeable
For office usage, there are a variety of ports on the back to connect to practically any type of device

For a basic PC-to-projector setup as used in so many offices, it's great for PowerPoints and video and against a pull-down screen the contrast is even better
It's very light and portable so easy to move between personal and office use (I took it my niece's house to play video games - guess what she wants for Christmas now).Overall, I continue to be impressed with these Epson projectors which seem to get better with each iteration

As TVs get bigger and projectors get more sophisticated, it becomes tricky to choose between them in some cases
Still, at this price and with this feature set, this is a great unit that will suit most needs.


$SUMMARY.: Very sharp, easy to set up and works equally well for presentations or movies

Comparable ones are in the $35 price range and this one costs half as much. If you go to the store, the only ones in this price range are the single power strip with 5-6 outlets that are difficult to use if you have multiple AC adapters.

$REVIEW.: My 5.1 home theater system wasn't compatible with my new VIZIO 42&#34; flat screen T.V
so I needed something else to improve it's anemic sound, especially when watching music channels
 I obsessively looked at all the sound bar options out there and settled on this one due to a mixture of price and reviews

 So far, I can say I'm pleased, but it didn't blow me away.It sits unobtrusively in front of my T.V

 It doesn't block the IR function of the T.V
 It was easy to attach to the T.V
using the included cable

 It cannot be programmed into your T.V.s remote

 The remote has seperate volumes for bass and overall volume
 This actually works nice as DW isn't crazy about alot of bass during movies.This definitely improves the sound and makes watching Palladia a pleasure


 It is not the same as the 5.1 system I had, but it is an improvement
 It's good.

 I bought it for my son and we used it on a recent trip and it took great pictures

 I had my Canon Rebel on the trip also but rarely took it out of the case, as this one was so convenient to use
 I didn't want to take my Canon to the beach so this one went with us and we didn't worry about it getting sand or water on it

 My son tested the underwater capabilities and the pictures were good and there were no leaks


 Overall, it's a good camera for the options and the price.

$review_text.: I have purchased Anker products before and been pleased. However, this product does not meet my needs.I have a MacBook Air and use the Apple USB Superdrive and a G-Tech 1TB G-Drive. Neither one of these devices would work through the Anker Hub. I returned it since it would not work for me. Most of the reviews are very good but for me I could not use it.Revision...... Anker customer service contacted me concerning the problems I was experiencing. After discussions with the rep I'm convinced my expectations were not right for this product. Per Anker the Apple drive will not work through a hub and the Q-Drive requires a powered hub. He said it might work sometime but not be consistent.Anker sent me a powered hub. (Anker AH111 USB 3.0 4-Port Hub with 12V 2A Power Adapter and 3ft USB 3.0 Cable [VIA VL812 Chipset]. It is working really well with my Q-Drive.

$review_text.: Bought these after reading so many positive reviews. They're not perfect, but they sound REALLY good for being so inexpensive. They were $30 when I ordered them, they sound nearly as good as some $100 speakers I've tried.I can hear some hissing and distortion in the upper ranges. Sometimes softer acoustic tracks get muddied. The subwoofer distorts on bass heavy tracks when you turn the volume up. Tweaking with the equalizer in iTunes helped relieve some of this. I tested it with bass heavy techno, pop, and some acoustic tracks. They all sound decent, acoustic is probably the weakest and pop is probably the strongest. (Spoiler alert: I'm not an audiophile and don't actually know what I'm talking about.)The speakers themselves are very lightweight. This scared me at first, but they sound good so lightweight is a plus. I like the design, but that's just my opinion. There's a fine black mesh in front of the speaker cone (you can't see it in the picture) that protects it from getting damaged. I like this. The woofer is not huge, nor is it very heavy. It has a nice shiny wood finish and looks like a standard subwoofer.TL/DR: Great speakers if you're a po' student like me and need to listen to music at a moderate volume while you do work.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this Blu-ray player (my first...) as a factory refurbished unit for about half the retail price, which I think is a fair price for this player.  Out of the box it looked new, and plugged into myOnkyo TX-NR727 7.2-Channel Network Audio/Video Receiver (Black)it was immediately recognized, allowing for set-up after throwing two AA batteries in the remote.I like that there are easy to navigate buttons for basic operation of the unit on the top right of the player, not just on the remote.  I also like that the unit itself is a small one; about 2/3rds the size of my old Samsung upconverting DVD player.I connected my player via HDMI cord, through the AV receiver. On screen set-up was intuitive, and easy to use.  I did run into a snag when my wired internet connection through myBolse 300Mbps Wireless-N mini Router / AP / Repeater (802.11 b/g/n) Wireless Amplifier, Including LAN Connection, WPS buttonwhich I use to extend the range of my wireless network in my home, wouldn't provide a proper gateway address for the Blu-ray player.  I then plugged in my ethernet cord connection into myWD My Net Wi-Fi Range Extender - universal dual-band wireless network range extenderand the connection was established.NOTE:  With no-Wifi in this unit, you'll need to provide a wired Internet connection to this player if you want to use the Internet based services like Amazon Instant Video, Netflix and Hulu.The primary reason for this purchase was its Blu-ray disc playing capabilities, and that it has Amazon Instant Video streaming.  So many of the current Blu-ray players and streaming devices don't have it.  I've depended upon Roku to get the job done, but when my older Roku died, I didn't necessarily want to hook-up a new one right next to my AppleTV to get just the Amazon Instant streamed to my TV.  Since I've been dragging my feet about buying a Blu-ray player, when I saw this one had Amazon Instant streaming - I was sold.NOTE: You'll need to pair your Blu-ray player with premium services like Netflix (designated button on the included remote for this service), Hulu and Amazon Instant prior to gaining access.  It's pretty easy, but you'll need to go online to type in the code that the player gives you for pairing, which is done via the Internet - thus you need to have your wired Internet connection established prior to attempting this set-up.This Blu-ray player set-up detects your system and lets you know what to expect in terms of video quality.  My older plasma HDTV will only provide 1080i output, thus the Blu-ray can only provide that, and not 1080p.  If your TV can only provide 720P, that is what the Blu-ray can provide you.  In other words, ANY Blu-ray player's output will be limited by the source it's hooked up to and you shouldn't expect 1080p quality viewing on a TV or monitor that isn't capable of this resolution.This player is a tad slower to than I expected it to be, but the picture quality and sound via the HDMI connection is great! I really enjoy watching Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Instant Prime content on it too.  Lots of channels that I didn't expect to find were on it (just like with aRoku 2 Streaming Player (Black) (Roku 2720R )you have options to stream...).  My husband (who is Russian) was delighted to find a Russian channel on it, which was a fun discovery.Connecting and setting up this player was very easy.  I did it without looking at the directions.  Playback is excellent, but a tad slower than I expected.  Since I have no Blu-ray player to compare it to, I had no pre-conceived expectations.  I managed to sync my Amazon account for streaming video, which is what I'd hoped to do.  Blu-ray movies look and sound excellent, and overall, I'm very pleased.This is a now 'older' player and it doesn't play all regions of DVDs, nor does it have Wifi.  Despite this, I'm pleased with my purchase and I would recommend it to others who have a wired Internet connection nearby, and who want to have access to Amazon Instant Video to stream to their TV.

$review_text.: I've tried a bunch of bluetooth headsets and this one is the best one I've found so far. They are good for biking, rollerskating, erging (rowing on a stationary rower) and walking all over the place to do errands.Since the bulk of the headset rests around your neck, the earbuds are really light, which helps them stay in your ear. I did end up putting my own silicone tips on them because the ones that come with didn't fit me quite right, but I usually have this problem with most silicone earbud tips.When I first got these, I never really used them to talk to people, in fact I wasn't even pairing them with my phone. Then one time I did have them paired to my phone and I heard a noise and pressed a button and what's this? I'm having a conversation with someone on my phone! I was riding my bike in traffic at the time, had no idea what I was doing and yet was able to answer the phone, have a conversation and then hang up afterwards, so I'd say the controls are pretty intuitive. I've used some other headsets where buttons do a lot of different things, since there just aren't that many buttons, but these let you answer the call on your left, pause your music with the right, raising and lowering volume is on one side, going forward and back on tracks is on the other. I really find it easier to navigate than the styles that try to be smaller and more compact.They do move around sometimes. Especially when riding my bike, they will EVENTUALLY start twisting to the side so by the time I've finished a ride and removed my sling bag, sometimes they are completely out of place and maybe hanging off my back on one side. Meanwhile, of course the earbuds will have fallen out. When they do come out, though, there is never a yanking out from the ears as I've experienced with other headsets with earbuds. The earbuds also come out of their magnetic holders sometimes, but overall they stay put pretty well.I will often be wearing these when I get wherever I'm going walking or biking and I don't find people staring at them strangely or even seeming to notice them much, which I think it a plus.The sound is decent quality and there is some noise cancelling going on. I sometimes wear just one ear at a time, especially if I'm in traffic or I just want to hear what's going on around me. I do find that weird head movements (especially biking or maybe rooting around in my bag while on the train) can sometimes cause buttons to be pushed, like all of a sudden I guess I've pushed the pause button with my chin or turned the volume up/down when twisting around.I sometimes lose the connection for a moment or off and on depending on where the phone is in relation to the headset. On my bike, I've had pretty good luck with it when the phone is in a pannier on the back of the bike, but sometimes when it's in a bag on my back, I lose the signal. It seems to help when I put my iPhone 4s into the outside pocket of my bag, upside down. Lately, I've done even better by getting a little bag that fastens to the front of the top tube of my bike frame (up by the fork.)Cycling JFLY Roswheel Frame BagIt's meant to hold a phone and not only does it maintain my bluetooth connection but I can actually look at my phone to do things like find out what time it is.The customer support from LG is not very good. I was having trouble pairing my headset with my phone at one point (it just wasn't working) and the LG support site had a list of all these different electronic items so you could find yours and get an automatic service/return request and this headset wasn't on the list so it required actually being on hold and talking to a human and asked some silly questions before being given instructions for sending in the headset (with me paying for shipping.) Then I didn't hear anything from them for a while, then one day my headset showed back up with a note that seemed to be saying I forgot to put my proof of purchase in with the headset so they didn't work on it BUT I tried it again and it seemed to be working so...whatever, I don't know. It's out of warranty now as I write this anyway, so not something I have to worry about any more! At least it's working, but if it wasn't, unless something better has come along in the meantime, I'd probably buy another of this same style because of it's multiple activity uses, general ease of use and fairly long battery life.Oh, I should also mention that I have sweated on it quite a bit and that hasn't seemed to affect it at all.
$SUMMARY.: Good for biking and other physical activities

$REVIEW.: The FRiEQ 4ft Auxiliary is the highest quality aux cable I have. This is a heavy duty audio cable is to be plugged into a radio or home theater to play your audio on you 3.5mm headphone jack device like an iPhone 5. This cable works with most of my cases because it is raised a little from the thick part to the actual 3.5mm headphone plug. This is my everyday home theater aux cable now. The cable is professionally jacketed in a rope like material. The cable is also designed not tangle. The cable also has nice pattern on it that looks great. This cable is currently at an excellent price that is very affordable. This cable also has a double shield to protect against any kind of interference. This is my favorite aux cable and it looks good when I use it.I highly recommend this cable.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.

$review_text.: Although I never used the U3 application that comes with the Cruzer Titanium, it died anyway.  It has become completely unreadable by any computer for no apparent reason.  In reading reviews on this and other websites, this seems to be a recurring problem with the Cruzers although most attribute it to the U3 software utility.  While the casing does make it extremely rugged and the slide/LED design is both convenient and visible, it means nothing if the drive itself is unstable and can't keep your data secure.  While I can't recommend it, if you must buy this product, back up your data regularly or don't trust it with anything you can't afford to lose.

Here are the things I don't like:1- The battery life is poor.2- The online software is buggy3- The directions are frequently wrong...when looking for the Interstate, it has guided us into vacant lots, people's driveways, etc.4- Signal accuracy- I need the unit most when I'm in the city. The TomTom can't distinguish the roads in the city (e.g. they are too close together and the unit thinks you are on Third street when you are on 4th street).5- Documentation is very poor.6- Bootup can take 4 minutes.

$review_text.: I've got two machines using a i7-2600k on a Sabertooth p67 motherboard - this fan works perfectly. The down-facing fan design is ideal for motherboard cooling, the fans can be easily removed or re-arranged. The unit is ULTRA quiet and is cooling our overclocked chips down to 27C when idle / 50C when full load at 3.5mhz / 70C when full load at 4.6mhz (ambient room of ~24c)Noctua Thermal Grease is one of the best on the market and this unit comes with a big syringe full of it - enough to remount this thing a dozen times at least.** Make sure to install the optional fan brace / bracket that comes with the unit.  Install the bracket BEFORE mounting onto the CPU.  There was a slight vibration on both machines after installing using the dual fan configuration pointing downward, but once we installed the extra brace the vibration went away.Super Quiet, No Vibrations, Incredible Packaging, Build Quality, Great Instructions, Great Cooling.
$SUMMARY.: Awesome Product - SILENT - GREAT Cooling

It seems to have helped the computer tremendously since we installed it (everyday this first week). I will amend this review or add another if we encounter any problems. So far this is a great cheap way to help an older computer. The memory bank (B) installed in about 2 minutes with no effort.

$REVIEW.: I purchased this DVD player about a month ago. I only use the HDMI input and I have a yamaha vx465 receiver that allows the transfer of audio streams through HDMI. Here are my thoughts about this unit:+ EXCELLENT upconversion. I played various DVDs and the image is really outstanding, especially given the price of the unit. I have a 32inches XBR9 bravia by Sony, and the picture is really crisp. I've actually seen bluray transfers looking worse than an upconverted DVD on this player.+ incredibly easy to make region free. Codes are available everywhere on internet, or in some of the reviews previously posted. It plays region 2 DVDs flawlessly.+ DivX ready. Does not read MKV files.+ Small. Its form factor is easy to plug everywhere.+ the menus and options, despite a cheap price tag, are actually very complete.- Well, I guess it goes with the low price, but the build quality leaves a lot to be desired. The unit looks cheap and the dvd loading drawer looks really fragile. You want to load it with caution and close it with the button, not by pushing it back with your fingers. This is a bit dissapointing. 4 years ago, I had gotten a DVD642 by philips too, and although it was in the same price range, the build quality was much better.- The remote is too simplistic. I wish it had more optionsOverall, a great product, especially for people playing imported DVDs. 2 thumbs up for the upconversion quality. I have seen more expensive players doing a worst job. You won't get the same result as a $500 Denon DVD player, but if you're on a budget, this is a great little player with fantastic 1080p output. (HDMI cable mandatory!!)

$REVIEW.: This is a great little case, especially for the price. It holds my mini snugly and securely, yet it completely disappears when using it. My last mini case had the four corner straps that covered a small section of each corner of the screen. This case is not intrusive at all on the screen.Even though I hardly ever use it in this manner, the case does allow you to stand the ipad up at two different angles if you need to...great for use in the kitchen if your making a recipe, or if you're watching a movie. I also love that the case puts the ipad to sleep whenever you close it. My last one did not and those two minutes it takes for the screen go black can add up and start to drain your battery.Overall, I definitely recommend this case! It's a great price, it's simple to put on and remove, and it doesn't obstruct any part of the screen whatsoever. Very happy with this purchase.

$REVIEW.: This thing is perfect! Well built, even has two bubble levels on it so you know your camera is in perfect position
The handles are easy to adjust for the camera base as well

Also, since its an amazon branded tripod (Amazon Basics) I'm sure their customer support is better should you have a problem with it


Price is great too! Perfect for beginners and more experienced photographers alike
I also really like that the tripod folds up into a nice compact size and that it has a handle near the top, perfect for getting extra stability for shooting video or something like that


I use it to hold my camera steady while I make video blogs (vlogs) and it works great.

$review_text.: First the pros and cons.Pro:Easy to setup.Handy monitor.Good default motion sensor levelsSturdy CamerasGood recording system, with overwrites, sorted by date/time.Reasonably good resolutionReasonably good night visionExcellent rolling record for moving subjectsCons:LOW range. Comes stock with 1-2db antennas, most good systems have 6-9db antennas.No way to upgrade antenna on base.No wifi capabilitiesPoor monitor controls unless you use remote.Requires moving AVI files to PC, then converting to MP4 to render them usable.No internet/IP capabilities whatsoever.No battery backup in DVRNo way to add a second monitor, or expand the systemOverly sensitive 'light' aspect detection to motion (tree shadows, etc)Buggy Quad mode, sometimes switches between cameras for no reasonNOT WATERPROOF! IP01/IP00 rated cameras, don't expect them to last if exposed to the elements!NO granular controls of anything really, such as motion sensitivity, light ranges, etc.NO push capabilities (sending texts/alerts to devices etc)Ultimately this was easy to install, and the SECOND NIGHT it picked up a prowler around our property. I figured we had losers prowling around here, and it was good enough to give to the cops to issue an APB for the guy. For that, it works. But it soon became apparent this system was too limiting for me for the cost. Without ANY capability to monitor from remote, or even in my bed, I felt naked. Without any capability to expand it to extra monitors, or access recordings from the internet I felt pretty blind! Then came issues with false motion detection with no way to adjust it other than some scotch tape over the sensor.. Then came the 'lower' resolution in some cases which made it HARD to identify someone/something. Although these cameras are nice, they simply aren't up to commercial standards - good homeowner stuff, that's it! The last straw was range.. 20 feet away through a couple of walls this thing totally failed to pick up a signal.. Given it's not WIFI and relies on an old 2.4Ghz cordless phone standard, it's NOT going to get range, and you WILL NOT be able to boost that signal!I uninstalled it all and returned it.I elected to go with a Trivision 336W HD camera. Offering high definition resolution, strong 6db antennas, and WiFi. Local+Remote access. Cameras are long range, and super resolution - license plates and faces at 45 feet! Ip66+ rated camera, which is full immersion in water, rock/sand/dirt proof. They are sealed, but to last.Then I added Blue Iris software on an older PC in the home to act as a server. Blue Iris allows 'extreme' customization of all aspects of a camera system. I can 'mask' areas where I don't care, and 'hotspot' areas to be extra diligent about.. I can tweak everything. Further, using this method I can access all cameras anywhere on the planet, from any device on the planet. I can CONTROL them from remote. Blue Iris allows me to 'push' notifications, such as a doorbell to my devices/phones/tablets if someone comes to the door. Remarkable!Monitors? Easy.. I purchased some CHEAP $40 Tablets from Amazon here, with some cheap mounting brackets. One on each floor provides a full control panel, monitoring, and emergency trigger for every floor of the home - all wireless!  A check 7 inch Tablet is the perfect solution in my view. Install Blue Iris Mobile on each tablet, slide them into the brackets in say your bedroom, and by your computer, and you have a full home monitoring system.The system I have in place is 1000x better. BUT it is NOT for people that cannot 'set' things up, or 'tweak'.. Be warned.. If you want a fire and forget 'reasonable' system - then THE DEFENDER is the best one on the market IMO. If you want more, then I recommend the route I ended up going!
$SUMMARY.: OK home system, as long as you can live with the limitations.

Unfortunately, the sound bar did not work with my Vizio TV (I tried ever single possible input with the red/white/yellow cords and nothing), but I have found that the Bluetooth feature works great.  So I've been able to modify my usage for the product by listening to my iPod and iPad with it.  I have a small apartment, so the sound travels well and looks nice.  If the product was able to work with the television, it would be five stars, but if you use the Bluetooth feature, the purchase looks a lot better.  The more modern soundbars have HDMI slots, which is much easier to install.  All around, a solid product.

$review_text.: Let's face it: you aren't going to become a famous photographer, director, or videographer using some digital recording device and this tripod. But if you have aFlip MinoHD Video Camera - Black, 8 GB, 2 Hours (3rd Generation) NEWEST MODEL, small handheld digital camera, or similar device, this tripod will definitely come in handy and will probably help improve your videos and photos. It sets up easy, adjusts quickly, and holds everything still. The magnetic feet assure consistent, secure positioning when used on a metal surface, and they are strong enough that if your device is pretty light, you can actually use this on a vertical magnetic surface (though you do have to be careful about this). I didn't have any problem making adjustments or getting the sort of position I wanted, except for perfectly level positions, which require patience and time to get all the legs, joints, and camera mount all synched to the point of perfect level-ness. And after praising the magnetic feet, I have to say that those feet are also my only other complaint, in that they are so strong, they tend to grab hold of things I wish they wouldn't, like paper clips, scissors, and the metal ruler I keep on my desk. (Not to mention you have to be careful about where you place this thing when using it around your computer.) This tripod is small enough, too, that you may just leave your camera on it all the time, because even if you are traveling, if you have a pocket big enough to hold a Flip, you probably have a pocket big enough to hold the Flip and this tripod. This tripod is nothing fancy or impressive, but it is a very useful, portable, and solidly performing addition to the average amateur digital photographer/videographer's tool kit.

$REVIEW.: I am generally impressed with this card. I am going to write a simple review since I hadn't compared it to other cards. I have 8gb ram and quad core processor(don't remember which one) I run games at 19xx by 1080 and most new games with few exceptions run at very high frame rates of 60fps or higher on highest settings. Some games need medium settings like Crysis still.The negatives for me are the thickness of the card and loud fan. The card is inserted into a slot and one more slot is taken for the fan. I really needed something else to put I to there. Also when games run on high settings the video card is pretty loud. But I don't mind since it's underneath the table.

$REVIEW.: This player is finally what I expected a new BD player to be.  I first purchased a Sony BDP-S570 but it turned out to be VERY disappointing.  I finally decided to try this LG BD-590 and now I really wish I had just purchased this one to start off with.  One of the biggest features for me is playing .avi files.  I used to have a home theater PC in the living room and got very used to being able to play .avi video files.  Now that I have moved I don't have my old home theater anymore and was really wanting my new BD player to serve as a compact replacement for my old home theater pc.  The Sony was so disapointing but this LG player finally does this.  It handles DNLA well which the Sony didn't, and for the best possible speeds I can just move the file out to the player on disc or USB thumb drive and play the file directly from the players own internal hard drive.  On top of this netflix plays much smoother and provides a lot more options in netflix then the sony player did.  Now I have videos, pics, and music all on the BG-590 internal had drive ready to go on a whim just like with my old home theater pc.If you just want to play Blue ray discs just about any player should work fine.  If you really want all the new bells a whistles though don't waste your time with other players like I did, this is the one to get.

$REVIEW.: I have always captured video with my Canon VIXIA HF-100, and I worked with cards of class 6 and even 4 and used the best FXP mode (17 Mb/s).  When I received this card, allegedly of class 10 (BUT IT HAD NO #10 ON THE CARD), and put it into the camcorder, I received a message: "Cannot record in FXP mode with this card".  I have never seen such a message before.  The card did record in a slower mode.  Therefore, I returned it and bought another card (Class 6) directly from Amazon. This card works perfectly.  The seller cooperated but sent me a return label with insufficient postage, so I needed to add the postage. Then the seller argued with me that the postage was suffucient but eventually reimbursed me.
$SUMMARY.: Does not record video at the FXP mode

It didn't charge completely,windows would constantly show alerts suggesting to replace the battery

I admitthat i was adamant of buying a battery because, honestly, you never know how are going to work.well, after some quick research i found Anker's Battery


I order it, received well packed and in time and after using it for a couple days now i can say that it gave my laptop a 2nd life


It works wonderfully and lasts like 4-5 hours without charging.I'd recommend this product to anyonw.

$REVIEW.: This is a basic case for an iPod Nano 6th Gen that offers very basic protection to the sides and has a slightly raised bezel to protect the screen from flat drops.  It fits perfectly and is easy to snap on.  It is thin plastic and will not hold up to major damage.  It is really only to protect the sides for every day minor bumps and scrapes.  There is no protection to the back because of the clip, but the clip still works fine.  If you are looking for a very inexpensive Nano case that offers some basic protection, this one is worth consideration.  If you need major damage protection, look elsewhere.I paired it with the following inexpensive screen protector that worked well:eforCity Clear Screen Protector for iPod nano 6G , 3 Pack)

$REVIEW.: The "Crucial 1GB 184-Pin PC2700" memory module has brought new life to my mother's aging Dell Dimension 2400. With a scant 256mb of RAM, it was taking forever to boot up and run applications. Being on a budget, she didn't want to buy a new computer for the few things she needs a computer for (games, web surfing, email, and the odd Word doc now and then) so she asked me to take a look.The cheapest place to start was a memory upgrade so I went to the Crucial web page and ran the auto detect application that told me what memory module we needed.Installation was easy and fast. The computer recognized the new memory on boot up and the improvement was just remarkable! It was running like a new PC!Highly Recommended!

$REVIEW.: The screen of the ASUS is pretty sad
It shows fingerprints like crazy


OK, at this price perhaps you can't get oleophobic coatings like on an iPad but it certainly gets annoying

So, I tried these screen protectors (only the matte so far)

It was pretty easy to put on

I also put on a Poetic Graphgrip case which overlaps the screen and the edges of this protector very neatly.Tips: Start by cleaning the screen very well, make sure there is no dust on the glass
Some people like to work in a less dusty environment like a bathroom


Next, place a loop of stickytape around your index finger (sticky side out)
Apply the protector from one edge and smooth your way slowly along the screen to remove all bubbles
Inevitably you will see some bubbles with a tiny speck of dust inside..


but stay calm, lift the protector gently and  dab those off with the sticky tape
You may have to do this many times depending on how dusty your environment is..

Be patient.The result is excellent
I'm seeing much less fingerprint marks but the screen is ever so slightly blurred by the matte effect


A reasonable compromise to me.

$REVIEW.: If you're looking for a simple, inexpensive way to boost the volume on a smartphone or mp3 player, this is it. I bought one of these to listen to music in my bedroom. I didn't want a set of large obtrusive speakers in there and I was unhappy with the quality of the built-in speakers on my smartphone. This speaker was a perfect solution for me. It's quite small (it can fit in the palm of my hand), so I just keep it on my nightstand next to my phone. The sound quality and volume is actually pretty impressive considering how small it is. It sounds great and can get pretty loud if you want it to. There are no volume controls on the speaker itself, so you'll have to rely on the volume control on the device you're using it with...that wasn't really an issue for me though. The battery lasts quite a while and its easy enough to charge since it just uses a USB cable. The only thing I wish is that it could charge the battery and play music at the same time. Occasionally I forget to charge it, and then I don't have it ready when I need it. Overall I've been very pleased with it though...so much so that I bought another one and gave it to my mom. She enjoys cooking quite a bit and uses the speaker regularly to listen to music while she's in the kitchen. She says she has absolutely no trouble hearing it even over all of the other noises of the kitchen (exhaust vents, running water, etc.). It's definitely a great buy.

$REVIEW.: I bought the JBL On Stage over a year ago for $110 (the current price should be lower) in order to have portable sound when travelling. Some pre-2006 units had a defective chip, but this one worked flawlessly out of the box. Never had a problem with it.  The sound is very good for the compact size -- surprisingly good bass response -- but still keep in mind that this is a portable speaker set, not a high-fidelity home stereo component. Surprisingly loud volume for such a small unit -- plenty to fill a hotel room. By now, adapters for all the iPods should be included -- for my unit, JBL mailed me free one for my 4G 30GB (request via their website).  The separate AC power supply is rather heavy and bulky (to supply enough power to drive loud volume), but still portable. I do not see the justification for buying the newer, more-costly On Stage II model unless you're desperate for a remote control.PLUS:- good sound quality- small size, portable- easy to use, logical controls and functions- good ergonomics and styling- charges iPodMINUS:- HEAVY AC power supply (included). A 6 watt unit takes a lot of power to pump out so much volume, so it draws a lot of juice (no batteries, folks.)NET: I like and highly recommend this unit. Shop around, pricing varies quite a bit.
$SUMMARY.: Great sound at a decent price

$REVIEW.: Having spent several hours looking up various laptop locks, reading and even viewing reviews, and considering the pros and cons listed, I decided on purchasing this one. I wanted laptop thief deterance for 5 to 10 minute absences, with the assurance I can get it on and back off (when I want to leave), without attracting too much attention.It offered keys; usually a superior system.  Too many combinations reported as sloppy or jamming: users who set a combination then can't get them to work.  And these keys were reported as unique, not the kind that some reported as allowing a master to open them. I didn't like the reviews where some locks were so easy to pick. (they even had videos.) Plus, having 2 keys offered security in that if I couldn't find one, I'd know where I put the other one.  A drop of oil or WD40 in the lock right off solves keys reported to stick or wont' turn.The nub you initially set on the computer is nice and tight, allowing a snap of the lock on and off. It feels tight and secure.  Plus this product seems a newer generation of design. I think they solved some of the prior problems.The 6 foot cable is adequate. It will halt a santch & grab, while you pop up to the counter or restroom. People who criticized about wire cutters, or hours without oversight are being unreasonable.  Once the nub is on the laptop, the whole system (sans keys) is one piece and coils up/fits into a pack or carry case. it goes on and off fast and easy.Price was slightly higher than the middle, but, you get what you pay for, it's been worth it so far.  My laptop has always been there when I hustle back in either the library or coffee shop.Addendum: More than a year later, I'm still satisfied.

This thing is incredible, reading the owners' manual and scrolling through the menus, wow.  Good news is the battery is the same design as my Olympus Stylus 1200.  I WILL buy a micro 32GB memory card, extra batteries and external charger on Amazon for this camera.  What I think is SLICK about this camera, (This makes five. similar, that I have/had: two Panasonic, one Olympus, gave my old Cannon to my son)it has a button on top for not only a photo shot but also a video recording, that is AWESOME!

But there is one problem I later experienced: Whenever my laptop wakes up from sleep mode, it does not recognize the adapter anymore, but the other two monitors wake up (hooked to VGA and HDMI respectively) together with the laptop. I need to unplug/plug the USB cable to wake it up. There might be a solution somewhere, but I don't have time or appetite to do the research. So I returned it. So... 2 stars.Updated on 8/21/2012After I put up my review here, I got an email form Pluggable tech support guy, eager to help me out. But I had already shipped the adapter back.

$REVIEW.: There are 3 laptops and 1 desktop in my home and we have a Seagate Freeagent 2TB external hard drive that my household uses to store various individual files in separate individual folders for individual back-ups. The one I have is the mini, not the type with the 1TB storage, so basically, this will just function as a server to access your external hard drive wirelessly and to stream data. Before we had the Verbatim MediaShare, back-ups were done manually: get the hard drive, place it where it is needed and back-up. Now with the MediaShare, the external hard drive stays in place and can now be accessed wirelessly, thanks to this little device's ability to be connected to the router. Now everyone can access their own individual personal files to back-up or extract data. We now also have the ability to share whatever we want between our PC's. You can also connect flash drives to the MediaShare and access it from anywhere thru Verbatim's myverbatim.com.From the box, the MediaShare mini is small and can be placed unobtrusively in a little corner just beside where you place your router, so space here will never be an issue. Installation can be a little intimidating at first. There is a cd where you can run the software and follow instructions step by step.  It also came with a Verbatim's Tuff n' Tiny ultra small 2GB USB drive that contains additional information on how to use this server for devices other than a PC. There is also a sticker underneath the box where an email address is located to contact someone for help if you are having any difficulties. I have so far not used it and has successfully integrated the device to my home network.On installation, I agree with one reviewer here that, if I may quote him, involves a "white hot ball of frustration" unquote. Installation will involve a few steps to go through and this includes you register the device with Verbatim. On set-up, you must create a name for your MediaShare as well as creating a user-name and password.. To avoid set-up frustrations, it is highly recommended to watch the included DVD set-up guide to "familiarize" yourself with the necessary steps for set-up. I failed to do this thinking it would be a breeze to set it up. Once everything is set up, you are good to go and this device will be ready to use. Now, my household has the ability to do their individual back-ups wirelessly and separately without the hassle of getting physically near the external hard drive to connect it to you pc. My household can also share files that is contained in a "general" folder where everyone can have access to. This is in addition to having each and everyone's personal and private files confined to just their own. This is a worthy device to any home network and I highly recommend having one if you have a home network with several pc's in your household.
$SUMMARY.: This is exactly what I needed for our home network with several pc's

$REVIEW.: I have several tripods but when I discovered my first monopod, I was so happy. I really hate carrying a big clunky tripod and now only do it when shooting video. When I need the extra stability, I use a monopod and I've tried several different kinds.Other than an expensive one that has little feet and, can in a pinch, do double duty, this monopod is my favorite. Some things I really liked (only one little flaw--not really a flaw, but I bought a &#34;mini ball camera mount&#34; so I could put a release plate on the base of my camera and leave a rotating &#34;head&#34; on the monopod so it can pan or tilt. But if you want to keep it fixed in place, you don't need anything--just screw it into the bottom of the camera* It is so lightweight. I have a bit of a wrist problem, but this is effortless to carry, to set  up and to use. It comes with a wrist strap, too, which means you can leave the case at home if you want, but...* I like the case. It doesn't mention or show it on the product page so I thought it was a really nice surprise. It's lightweight nylon, black like the monopod, zips up the full length and has a short strap so you can carry it over your shoulder vertically, quiver-style.* It's a great price* I like the construction. Very nice, generous, spongy grip on the top. The bottom has a little spike so you can stabiiize better if you're outdoors. However, when you're inside or don't need the spike for support, the rubber base just easily screws down over it, given a more secure footing on a carpet or floor without making a hole in it.* It's a great price. I've spent so much for monopods that were really too heavy (or, like gorilla pods, that were too light). This is so good with my camera (and takes weight up to 6.5 lbs.)* It's easy to use. You just flip back the tab and slide down one...two...or three sections. Unextended it's about 20&#34; and you can use the legs individually or in combination (they will also lock in place without being fully extended) so there's a lot of flexibility in how high you can take your camera. At maximum it goes to 5' 7&#34;, quite tall for most situations.If you're not sure if you really want to use a monopod, this is so inexpensive to try out. It's also so unobtrusive that I just have been leaving it in the car, just in case. Definitely recommended.

$review_text.: I have to start this review by saying that the vendor (Beach Camera) was outstanding!!!!  I can't believe how quickly the item traveled across the country!  And with free shipping, this is cheap insurance for my camera since I often use it in and around water.As for the wrist strap itself - it looks to be well made and I like the visibility it has in the water
I think it will do the job, but, one caution - I have small hands and wrists and this strap cannot adjust small enough to prevent it from easily slipping off my wrist

 I got creative and have a modified fix, but if I were using it while snorkeling or in white water, I would still attach a safety cord to it

Also, the little clippy thing that is supposed to allow you to release the camera from the wrist strap easily, is very stiff; I haven't been able to get it to release yet

 I'm guessing I will eventually find a way to release it and will be able to soften it up a bit.All that said, I would definitely buy from Beach Camera again, and, even given the short-comings of the product, would likely, all things considered, choose this product over other similar products.

Hence two stars instead of one.  But the Panasonic plays MP3s!Have not been able to get much radio reception out of this thing.

I do have to say I am not displeased in any way. The sound quality on this mp3 player is superb, it beats my computers speakers and now I can't stand to listen to my computer and have to have the mp3 player instead. The size of the device is also fantastic, it was a lot smaller then I though it would be and therefore it is very convinent when you are walking, traveling, or performing activities. The design of the device is quite simple and neat and fits it just right, and the color is gorgeous.(I bought the purple one). I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a simple, affordable, nice looking & convinent mp3 player.

$review_text.: I have this power supply powering an Asus P9x79 motherboard with a 3930K CPU, a single Gigabyte NVIDIA GTX 670 OC graphics card, 32 GB Kingston RAM, four fans including a Coolermaster TPC 812 heatsink, 2 SSD's(Crucial and Force 3 GT) and 2 optical drives in a stock, non overclocked system in a Corsair 550D case.  The PSU just "loafs" with this system, and its own fan NEVER comes on, even during 3D work in Photoshop.  The only way that I know that its fan is actually "working" is direct observation when turning off the computer where the final slight pulse starts the fan for a second.  Since the PSU never heats up sufficiently to kick its fan into operation, I can have no comment on how loud that might be, operating at low RPM's or at full tilt....suffice it to say, that, bottom line, in my system, the PSU is absolutely silent, for whatever that might be worth!!  As a Gold unit, it's efficiency (effective power: heat generated) is very high, so no wonder the fan is not called upon.The fully modular aspect, packaging, and outlets provided have been discussed in several reviews, so no need to repeat here.  Spatially, the unit fits comfortably into a mid sized case, and is not obviously oversized such as is the situation with 1000W and up.A few small points do need emphasis:1) the nylon-sleeved cord harnesses, while attractive,  are quite stiff.  This makes maneuvering them to their attachment sites a little tricky, but not a major detraction.  Working them back and forth helps loosen them up a bit.  Where it is potentially important is in getting the ATX 8 pin power connector attached to, and, especially released from the motherboard without going through the nuisance of removing a large heatsink which may partially obstruct access to that header, as it does in my case.  What I suggest is to buy an inexpensive 6 inch extension 8 pin connector which is flexible and much easier to deal with in a tight space.  You can then lead the extension through a passway to the rear compartment, and make the connection with the Corsair cable there easily where space is unobstructed.2) the SATA power connectors are VERY tight.  For people not familiar with these hookups, and rightfully told not to "force anything", just be sure you have the guide lined up correctly and push with gusto. Because of the considerable force needed, particularly when you detach the connector, be sure to pull exactly in the horizontal plane of the connection on the drive so that you don't risk breaking off the plastic post which will make the hardware henceforth unconnectible.3)  As mentioned in one review, the clips on the Corsair's cables' connectors sometimes don't "click" into place, and also the thumb release tabs can be rather stiff, making release a bit difficult.  That's another reason why I suggest the extension for the 8 pin ATX connection.As has been mentioned, these power supplies are made by Seasonics, and while there must be a few proprietary changes between what would seem to be identical units except for color, those differences must be slim to none by a manufacturer which is pre-eminent in PSU manufacture, coupled with a destination company that also markets only the highest quality goods.BOTTOM LINE:  Highly recommended.  It should supply adequate power and then some for all but perhaps the most demanding, sustained applications in overclocked systems with multiple graphics cards.
$SUMMARY.: Outstanding.

I like that when I adjust the aspect to fill the screen it displays that way on all the channels.  And that the DVD player and Roku can have different settings that remain. If I had one small negative it is that I liked one HDMI port on the right side like my 26", but I saw that ppl didn't like the cable sticking out of the side of the tv so they put them both on the back. Is ok...actually looks neater that way.I like the "Tools" quick adjust button on the remote - if I do want to change the pic, sound, etc easily without accessing the whole menu.  And I set it up to just show my favs so I can scan quickly thru them.  All the settings are easy to use and easy to see on the set.I had purchased the 26" and was happy with that one... so got this bigger one.

$review_text.: Doesn't charge my iPhone 3G..

but it will broadcast it to my radio


 It really doesn't broadcast very well, however
 The volume is really soft, so I turn the volume up and then almost blow my speakers when I go back to the radio
 Sound quality is borderline at best.I switched to one of those audiotapes with a wire - looks dorky, and doesn't charge the iPhone, but it sounds quite good


 Next week I'm going to try hooking up an Exonic FM transmitter in the back of my car - it supposedly has more power, and I think if you get the transmitter (or it's antennae) back near the car's antennae it should work better


 Up in the front, the car radio and antennae cable are heavily shielded to prevent interference from the car engine, so I guess I can't hold it against the little iTrip.My wife has a Sirius FM transmitter which works much better, but it has an antennae cable winding all the way back to the rear window...

$REVIEW.: This is a fine radio, but certainly not at all worth the extra money compared to the Sony SRF-37v in my opinion, unless you require a very small speaker and not simply earphone listening capabilities.PROS:1) It has generally quite good reception on all bands, but no NOAA weatherband reception is available. This latter deficiency is now being corrected by the new Sangean DT-400W (available in June 2008) with both weatherband reception as well as official NOAA weather alert detection capability for slightly more money than the DT-200VX. Both Sangean units have a monaural/stereo switch (bandwidth control) for FM listening improvement, but there is no RF (radio frequency) DX gain switch on the 200-VX as there is on the Sony SRF-37V, but see Con below.2) It has a very big easy to read display with a battery level indicator, a lock display indicator, a 90 minute shutoff capability and on-screen indicator for late night listening, etc. It also has a backlit display, but see Con below.3) There is a very nice arrangement (called My Favorites) for as many as 19 presets for any band in any order with simple retrieval of all presets, but only in order from the first one to the 19th one in a logical progression (it won't go backwards to find the previous preset for example).4) Its deep bass boost is a very nice feature.5) Automatic scanning capability and seeking capability, but see Con below.CONS:1) Backlight cannot be turned off even in daytime and even in bright sunshine conditions. It is apparently an LED with very low power drain, but it seems very illogical to me that it can't be overridden when it isn't needed at all. Apparently, it is actually only on while tuning the radio (I don't own this unit any longer, so I can't readily check this explicitly) and then it shuts itself off after a time, but to not be able to disable it entirely when not needed seems absolutely counterintuitive  to me.2) It is certainly well built with a fully attached battery compartment door (requiring two AA batteries), but it is not as rugged as the Sony SRF-37V (only requiring 1 AAA battery). Several reviews have discussed its demise after it was inadvertently dropped.3) During automatic scanning/seeking, the audio is muted so you can't hear any stations as they are detected. Only the strongest stations are picked up during the scanning/seeking process. Of course during manual scanning the individual stations are easily heard so that you can pick the station you want to listen to.4) When changing from the DT-200V to the DT-200VX, Sangean chose to put the speaker controls on the same slide switch along with the Stereo/Mono (bandwidth) changing capability. In my opinion the arrangement was better on the DT-200V with a simple and direct push button Stereo/Mono switch on the front of the radio and not on the side with one other commonly used function.5) The supplied earbuds are very uncomfortable and could also be quite dangerous given the volume output that this unit is capable of with 2 AA batteries.
$review_summary.: Fine radio, but not worth the extra money compared to the Sony SRF-37V

$review_text.: I used to provide support to about 150 desktop computers, many with multiple users, so I know just how disgusting keyboards can become after a while (hint: never, ever, assume a black keyboard is clean). I've use a lot of wipes over time from several manufactures. The 3M Disinfecting Desk and Office Wipes, 25-Count Canister (CL564) provides a perfectly good disinfecting wipe. I agree with some other reviewers that the wipe dispenser design problem remains unsolved.The wipes did a good job on my keyboard and were also good for cleaning my glass desktop (which is frosted on the bottom, so if there was any residue from the wipe, it was not visible). The Material Safety Data Sheet on the 3M site (web search CL564 MSDS and click on the Documents tab) did not raise any unusual safely concerns. I did not find the citrus scent to  be objectionable or overwhelming.I have to admit that 3M made and then discontinued my all-time favorite wipe: Scotch-Brite Disinfecting Scrubby Wipes. The Scotch-Brite Disinfecting Scrubby Wipes had tiny plastic spots embedded on one side which gave them a minuscule amount of abrasive ability that was great in the kitchen and bathroom. They were also  excellent for removing gunk from keyboards. I would happily pay a premium for those wipes, but I'm  not sure that the 3M Disinfecting Desk and Office Wipes are worth the cost-per-cloth over the numerous alternatives available.

$review_text.: At a fraction of the price, there's no way I'd choose the Nikon release cable over this one.  It plugs in perfectly, and a half-way button press gives me focus, with a full press releasing the shutter, just like the button on my D600.  The cable is a decent length, but I do wish it was a foot or so longer.  If the choice is available to me, I always go with this over the infrared remote.  There is one flaw, however. If you push the button forward while it's down, the remote will hold the shutter open.  That's a great feature, but it's so easy to do on accident that I would keep the shutter open and not feel like I did anything differently.  This would only ruin a picture if you were in bulb mode, but it threw me off the first couple of times it happened.  It would be nice if there was a bit more resistance with that shutter hold.  Still, I recommend this completely.  It does everything a cable release needs to, and at a much lower cost than the OEM remote.

$review_text.: The Tokina 11-16mm Lens is an amazing piece of equipment, sharp even at wide open aperture and can even get a true 15mm on a Full-frame Canon EOS DSLR Body. I like this lens alot, which is why I wanted to buy another one to replace the one I recently broke.They are very rare lens to get New these days since the Japan Tsunami disaster and I needed one for a shoot this weekend. I looked on Amazon and I liked the fact that this purchase was going to be fulfilled by Amazon, even though there had been some mixed reviews recently on the seller: 17th Street Photo.I decided to take the chance cause I used to purchase film cameras and equipment from them a decade ago. Boy things can definitely change in a decade.Amazon did ship the item very quickly, I got it in 1 business day, however when I opened the Amazon packaging the Lens box looked dented and dinged... not from recent shipping but it looked like it was an aged box. On opening the lens box, the cardboard protection look like if someone stuck a big fat finger into it and busted it.The lens did appear to be in pristine condition, but there was no 3 year warranty card or instruction manual which I know comes with the lens. The warranty card is very important, since Tokina doesn't have online warranty registration so you need to keep the card safe somewhere. I didn't want to take the chance on not having the warranty card and the fact that the lens box looked old and tampered with, I opted to return the item, which Amazon was very efficient in doing.When something is sold as a New item, everything about it should be new... not just the item. I will not be buying anything from 17th Street Photo ever again. How can they justify selling an expensive ($100 more than most reputable camera stores) new lens and not have the warranty card with it.After I returned the lens, I ended up buying a Brand New Tokina 11-16mm lens from Kenmore Camera through eBay, and it came from Seattle to Miami in 2 days. The lens box was perfectly new as well as the lens, and it had the warranty and manual. It was also $135 cheaper than 17th Street Photo!

$REVIEW.: Having graduated from a Garmin nuvi 3750 4.3" screen to the Garmin nuvi 2555LT 5.0" screen may seem like a letdown considering that the 3750 is one of Garmin's flagship models.  However, I have been thoroughly pleased with the 2555LT for many reasons.I had a problem acquiring a signal when I set up previous Garmins for the first time.  The 2555LT finds the signal in just a few seconds.  Configuring a route also is very quick with this model.Although the display is not as crisp as the 4.3", the 5.0" screen on the 2555LT is quite readable even in bright sunlight.  I have tried both TomTom & Magellan and they are both weak in their displays showing too much glare in sunlight.Garmin has introduced many software changes making it easier for users to navigate.  One example is the inclusion of a STOP graphic that enables you to stop your current route without having to go to a separate sub-menu.  The 2012 software shows your saved destinations and tells you how many miles & minutes it takes to arrive there.The best benefit of the 2555LT is the price.  My first GPS units were close to $300.  Now with the 2555LT you get a 5.0" screen, traffic, junction view, eco-route and all the new features under $190.if you are considering a GPS, the Garmin nuvi 2555LT is simply a no-brainer!
$review_summary.: Great Value GPS!

$review_text.: These earbuds really do sound great - as others have mentioned, the base is good and the highs are nice and crisp - I'm not a connoisseur of earbuds but these are definitely the best quality earbuds I have tried.  The sound is definitely rich and full.  The cord is shorter compared to some other earbuds, but I really like that - it seems like so many have a ridiculously long cords which just makes them tangle easier. the cord on these is shorter and slightly thicker than cheaper earbuds I've had which I really like.  They come in a nice zipper case with makes it easy to store them when not in use. These are definitely high quality earbuds that should last a long time.

$review_text.: Everything you've read is true. Beautiful sharpness and clarity, great bokeh, superb low-light capabilities.NOT the lens for group shots in smaller rooms on 1.6 crop. Otherwise, BEAUTIFUL for portraits.Virtually silent and almost instant AF.I love the control over DOF by choosing the aperture you want. Easily isolate your subject in foreground, mid-distance or background for impressive effects. Or open it wide to 1.8 and isolate just one EYE in a portrait, if you prefer. Stop it down and add whole new dimensions for landscapes.For even more control, I'm a big fan of back button focusing on my 40D. (Visit the forum of your DSLR brand and &lt;SEARCH> "back button focus" to customize and learn to use this invaluable feature.) Separates focus from metering (often combined in half-pressing the shutter) to give ABSOLUTE control over focus point without risk of AF shift -- except when you want it, as in continuous focus. Virtually eliminates out-of-focus (OOF) rejects.Always-on MF on this lens is also convenient for tweaking AF, though I rarely use it.Not a true macro lens, but captures GREAT closeups and can be used with extension tubes, as others note.I like this focal length A LOT on a 1.6 crop. It's effectively 135mm, so you can stand well back from subjects and not intimidate them at all. (Though the lens hood makes it look formidable.) Terrific reach for candid street shooting, indoor sports, club and stage performances.Sharpness and quality, especially in RAW, as magnified for post-processing in Photoshop, is stunning.Always with me in my walkaround bag and usually on camera. My first thought in ANY situation is, "Can I use the 85?"By far my favorite lens.Great price with Amazon, as always, and really fast shipping.

$REVIEW.: PROS:1. Pleasant feel: durable, soft materials2. Hard case: easy to hold and very protective of the Kindle.3. Very soft lining with slight extra padding over the screen area really protects the screen well when closed.4. Perfect fit for the Kindle, not too bulky to fit in my handbag.5. Overall, nice looking designCONS:1. Lacks built-in support for the Kindle on the right hand side, making it too easy for the Kindle to slip out of it when turned upside down (has only two supports and these only on the left hand side). This can be overcome fairly simply by slipping the included strap over the top right-hand corner (and/or adding velcro as some people have suggested). But I look forward to seeing new cases with this issue taken care of.So overall a very nicely designed case, in my opinion the best one available for the Kindle thus far. It provides great protection and enables easy handling of the Kindle, and it looks and feels stylish and up to the standards of the cool and stylish Kindle.I look forward to Amazon's next design for a Kindle cover, and just hope they do not sacrifice all the beautiful aspects of the cover while improving the function.

$review_text.: For those unfamiliar, ASUS routers (at least the recent ones) are based on Tomato firmware, with some modifications. The result is powerful for the advanced users, but easy to set up in the basic interface. I can't speak for the DD-WRT implementation on this router, as I can find no real reason to change from the stock Tomato-based firmware.I only have one complaint about this router: it seems to require a full reboot for almost any settings change. It only takes about a minute for a full reboot of the router, but it still warrants mentioning.I have this router set up using a Verizon USB760 modem (from what I've seen, the best compatability is any USB modem that supports an NDIS connection. I set mine in NDIS mode, then connected it to the router, works perfectly. I have tried without NDIS mode, and it never seems to work.) I got this router primarily because it is supposed to handle USB modems better than the N56U (my other router). It IS definitely better. The first thing I noticed is that once you set it up for a USB modem, it disables the WAN port (the N56U keeps complaining that the WAN port is disconnected).Performance is as I have come to expect from ASUS routers: fantastic. This is only single-band N, but the performance is quite good. The NAT and QOS capabilities are some of the awesome features that ASUS includes. I used to be a stalwart NetGear router guy, until I tried the N56U. This router does not disappoint.If you use a USB modem (make sure it supports NDIS), this is the router to get. It won't break the bank (3G USB routers are crazy expensive), performs well, and has all the features you could want.
$SUMMARY.: Another well-built router, this one best for USB 3G modems

$REVIEW.: This is my second Golla bag.  My first is still in great shape, even after a fair amount of use and abuse, but it was too small for my new laptop.  I looked at a lot of options and didn't like any as much as the Golla bags.  These are well made, well designed, comfortable, and they provide excellent protection for the laptop, including on the bottom, where too many bags don't provide any protective padding at all.  They're roomy enough to carry other papers and supplies, and with nicely made pockets that easily hold chargers, wireless mouse, portable surge protector, and the like. I haven't tried it yet, but I'm pretty sure I could even fit a smaller sized projector in the bag, as well.  I'm not a fan of the color orange, but I like the cheeriness of this model.  It's fun without being extreme...and it's not boring black!  My only disappointment with this bag compared to the first I bought is that the pen holders were only one little strip of cloth rather than fully stitched pockets, which do a better job of keeping pens in place.  I'll have no hesitation in buying a third Golla bag, though if I do, it will be just for a little variety because they're so well made I don't expect the first two to wear out any time soon.

The stand is a nice addition. It works well on the stand or flat on it's bottom. It has a nice Cyberlink software bundle included. It works just fine as a plug & play device however.

$REVIEW.: I was looking for an iPod alternative, and based on cnet reviews I chose the Clix Rhapsody.  At first it was great.  I used it on the train while commuting and listened to audible books while running.  I also liked Rhapsody to Go, since it helped me discover artists with similar styles to ones I already knew I liked.Unfortunately, it was the Rhapsody feature that stopped working.  I'd get warning messages saying I needed to connect to Rhapsody to renew the tracks on my device.  Problem was, the Rhapsody channels didn't appear when I connected.  After 2+ hours with Rhapsody support, we concluded the device needed to be reformatted.  I did that and it worked again ... for a week.  Then the channels disappeared again.  Since this seemed to clearly be a device issue, I contacted iRiver support.  They kept replying back with the same set of standard responses, leading me to believe they are either an artificial intelligence engine (with a low IQ) or that they don't understand English.  After about 8 iterations of email followed by useless answer, I gave up.  The Clix went into the trash.Guess I'll try a Zune next.  At least they now have audible support.

$REVIEW.: I am mostly a Windows pc person. I had a time configuring this hardware since I have little experience with MAC hardware. I found it created TWO networks, which did not work, as I had to switch to the second network to do wireless backups, and could not connect to the web. Basically, I had to reset the drive with the button on the back and start all over again. This permitted me to join my already established network and do wireless backups at home. It took me severe hours to figure this out, but by trial and error I finally got it working. Directions, you say?? There were no directions, since this is a used item and I had to use my pc for help on he web while trying to connect it. The web was not much help, but the blurb I read about resetting it got me to thinking and that solved my problems. Once I got it going, it worked fine. I like it. Lesson learned.

$review_text.: This product has been out for a number of years and several issues apparently have been fixed, e.g. you can have multiple activations, the driver on CD is the same version as the one found at x-rite's website, and the customer phone support was friendly. What has not been fixed unfortunately is the software creating unusable profiles.According to the support technician you are supposed to set your monitor to factory defaults and then just run the ColorMunki software. Unfortunately my monitor is very warm in its default setting and the profile created by ColorMunki resulted in having strong purple shadows. So I started over with a more neutral color temperature, had ColorMunki take an ambient measurement and set a manual target luminance. That results in a profile with excessive contrast and crushed blacks. After a couple more attempts I finally ended up with a profile that was almost as good as the one I had manually created using a combination of HCFR, ColorEyes, and a Spyder2.Moving on to printer profiling I wanted to calibrate a Dell color laser printer. The ColorMunki created a profile which softproofed way lighter than the actual print. There's an option to refine the ColorMunki printer profile for a specific image. Sometimes that option works, other times it just aborts with a generic error message. Either way, the refined profile did not change anything. The generic profile that's provided by the printer manufacturer was a much better match than the custom one created for this printer-paper combination by ColorMunki.After 3 days of fiddling with the settings I gave up and returned the item. Overall it's a great product idea but unfortunately it does not work.

$REVIEW.: Gigabyte has yet to let me down. They always seem to put out rock solid, stable motherboards. I dare say I might like them even more than ASUS on a few points. For AMD Trinity or the newer Richland APU's you can't go wrong with this board. The only thing I haven't figured out is the RAM speeds. I put DDR3-1600 in the slots, but the BIOS only sees it as DDR3-1333 speeds. These boards were used in client builds, so they wouldn't really care, but AMD's memory controller scales performance up when you use higher clock memory. Other than that, a solid, well laid out board. Another bonus from Gigabyte, is they favor the A85X chip, and the lower A75. ASUS only does the low end, useless A55 or A85X. They should just cut out the A55 all together. Personally, I think there is no reason to have the A75 chipset either, since the price difference to upgrade to the A85X is merely 10 dollars I have noticed.

$REVIEW.: Updated Review, 10/21/2012: Today, I contacted their support team on a final attempt to make this device work... Reason? The sound went out!!! I disconnected the HDMI cable from the Co-Star, connected it on the old Roku and everything was working! Sound, NETFLIX, and picture is great! So, their support team are really making it hard to send the product back. My mistake was that I did not purchase it from Amazon- I pre-ordered the damn thing directly from the company. After all the "troubleshooting" (which I already did on my own) the device was still not working and they are going to send me a replacement.Let's see what happens after I get the replacement and if the device works as it was advertised and promised, then I will change the stars and will recommend it everyone... but right now, hold off the purchase until the company fixes all the issues. It is a very promising little gadget and sure is cheaper than it's competitors- but it ain't worth the frustration._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________I own 2 other devices for streaming videos- xbox and roku. I have never had any issues with setting them up and using them. This device, however fancy as it may look and sound, is really not ready to be marketed just yet. Vizio sent this device out so the people who bought them are ones discovering the bugs and the malfunctions and calling their helpdesk support to report it -which in turn benefits the company because they dont have to spend money on real-live testing the product- they write a program to "update" the firmware and  "fixes" one bug after another. Well, we can opt to send the product back and get our money but customer has to pay 10% re-stocking fee and has to pay shipping costs. They will send a replacement for the device thou- after you give them your credit card. And it takes 2 weeks before you get the replacement, pack the old one and ship it back to them.Vizio turned their customers as beta-testers and tied them all with the "fine print" so customers has no choice but to concede. Still asking why Vizio is cheaper than it's competitors? Well, they can afford to be! Nobody reads the fine print anymore.

$review_text.: What a name for a motherboard! EVGA 132-BL-E758-A1-X58 SLI x 3 Motherboard....!!! WOW, you'd think that EVGA would have picked something trendy, or KUHL, like "E758 Rocketboard", or "BL-132 Blast Off Board"..oh I dunno, I am failing miserably just like EVGA did, so I'll stop there. No harm in trying to get a handle on it though, right?Well, the review of this thing is long, long overdue, so I'm going to have a go at it, wish me luck in getting all my thoughts about this great intermediate X58 board, and I only write that because it IS an intermediate board to the Classified series of EVGA boards. By itself, the 132-BL E758 board stands on its own merits, and has a lot of good people who have built it up over the past year since its release, but people are always wanting to compare it to Classified...that will NOT be the case here, tonight, I promise you that.I started out with this motherboard and the Core i7 920 series CPU, my 1st i7 920 build this year, and the motherboard never disappointed me at all. I naturally gravitated to a Classified for my main PC as the year progressed, but I have always kept this board in the box, safely stored in my garage cabinet for later use, and lo and behold I finally had so many "spare parts" sitting around that I built a 2nd Core i7-based CPU with the 132-BL E758 board and it has had my attention for the past couple of weeks as I trained it for duty here in my studio as an auxilary PC. I don't have a lot of uses for it presently, but as time goes on I'll devote more time and energy to using it. It's a really nice build-up that is running @ 4210Mhz 24/7 now, a very substantial number, one that certainly is making a lot of Folding@Home WUnits get into my tally at Stanford.edu!When I started out with the Core i7 920 series, it was with a C0/C1 CPU, tendered from back in March, 2009, where its life began at the Costa Rica Intel factory. Thus, I didn't have an easily over-clockable i7 920 D0-series CPU to work with initially, and suffice to say I had my work cut out for me to get the C0/C1 clocked up to 3.8Ghz, and run stable, and cool with a (*then*) Cooler Master V8 CPU Cooler in the house, a most daunting task. I *was* running 12GB of Dominator C8G 1600Mhz CL-8-8-8-24-74 SDRAM in the beginning though, so that posed some unique issues for me also. Read BIG HEADACHE! That RAM was just all junk, the long and the short of it, and was later RMA'd to Corsair, who replaced it all for some very, very nice RAM that was shipped direct to me from their Taiwan, CN factory, a very nifty trick they pulled off, and I was finally a happy camper with some Corsair RAM that was worthy of the name "Dominator", not "Suckinator"!But this is a review of the 132-Bl board, not my build with it, so let me start out by writing some of its strengths and attributes of note. First, with the right CPU in tow these boards are capable of achieving an overclocking that is right up there with the best of the X58 boards, Classified included. One of the key ingredients to a successful launch and maintenance is the board's BIOS, and I found that the BIOS from May, 2009 worked best for me, YMMV, and you may want to go with the latest and greatest BIOS for the 132-BL boards, but I felt, and still feel that that is the best BIOS for my purposes. Conversely, you may just want to use the current BIOS at EVGA since there won't be anything else available unless you have kept an ever-larger-growing library of the various BIOS enhancements from EVGA, and Lord only knows that the wizards at EVGA are constantly churning out a new BIOS!On that subject, let me write a few words...if the hose ain't broke, would you change it out for a new one? Probably not, right? Well, I feel just like that about BIOS for these boards...if your board is working great, why should/would you change BIOS? Right! So now you get my drift, and I'll leave that alone and let that be a personal decision between your conscience, reason, and outlook on such things...you know where I stand on it, that's all she wrote for my purposes.The 132-BL SLi x 3 motherboard can handle RAID 0, 1, and 5 as I recall on the internal bus, but suffice to say that I never used it. I very simply in the beginning went for the non-RAID SATA IDE/ATA application on the ICH10R bus, and used the JMicron (red SATA tabs on the board) for a 2TB RAID system, which never really did much for me in terms of storage. Later on I went for an Areca 1680IX-8 SAS RAID Controller and ran ALL my HD's off the Areca controller bus, didn't even use the internal bus, so I am a bad source for information on how to use the Intel RAID bus with this board...won't even go there.I did use the 12GB of RAM on board from the get-go, and that was a handful for me but not because running that much RAM is hard to do...it was a handful because the RAM was defective, and I didn't know it! How about that? NOT a good thing...to say the least. The boards have an interesting quirk with respect to over-volting the VDIMM though, which you may want to jot down for future use, and that is this: When you are adjusting VDIMM in BIOS, the board do NOT have the increments 1.63V or 1.64V in BIOS, they go from 1.625V all the way to 1.65V, nothing in-between there! So if you are wanting to run 1.63V or 1.64V on the VDIMM adjustment, you cannot do it! Crazy! But true...so buyer beware there.Further, when you run the SDRAM @ 1.65V VDIMM (many believe this one of the keys to successful overclocking with the boards and most SDRAM of the 1600Mhz+ DDR3 variety), it over-volts the SDRAM to 1.69V in BIOS, and that can be too much voltage for some RAM. Me? I preferred running my SDRAM @ 1.625V VDIMM, which resulted in a setting of 1.65V in BIOS if you set the SDRAM. then jumped back into the BIOS and went to the "System Health" Report in BIOS, and BAM! You can get the accurate actual voltage for these boards then, and then alone, unless you are using a DMM (Digital Mutli-Meter) on the test points on the board UNDER LOAD, to get an accurate reading of actual voltage being applied by the board to the components. So that is an interesting little quirk of these boards that you might want to note for the future, and if you are using RAM at higher voltages those ideas will apply.What else is interesting and unique to these boards of note. Oh yes, you might want to read this if you are concerned about the VREG assembly of the boards. These tend to run HOT! Yes, it's a proven weakness, weak point of the assembly process mostly, but the VREG heat sink, which is the heat sink assembly which faces YOU when you look down at the CPU area of the boards, opposite the SDRAM area...yes, THAT heat sink and assembly. Well, if it does run HOT in your board consider this, because I had to do it to mine:If your VREG is consistently running at higher than 75-80-degrees Celsius UNDER LOAD you may want to remove the bolts that hold it to the motherboard, remove it, and R&R; the TIM material (which is a set of paper insulating thermal pads OEM from EVGA) therein, and replace it with some good, high-test TIM material, which is NOT CONDUCTIVE, ie don't use Artic Silver 5 there!! Use something like MX-1-2, OCZ Freeze, any of the good non-metallic TIM materials, and replace those pads, and to the best of your ability clean up that area, see if you can get the heat sink and the VREG assembly to to seal reasonably well, (which can sometimes be impossible, or at least seem impossible, because they are so far "off center" and not in alignment), reinstall the heat sink and the VREG assembly, and BAM! You will if you do a nice job of it that is, probably change those temps to be sub-50-degree Celsius ON LOAD, and certainly sub-60-degree Celsius ON LOAD, merely by straightening out the VREG assembly and the TIM material therein! So that is another little tidbit about this board, a caveat if you will, that CAN be important. If your board runs cool on the VREG this will not apply to your board, but most of them do run hot!An easy fix to the VREG issues in addition to doing the TIM Shuffle? Put a small 40mm fan on the VREG assembly, have it taped down there with some double-sided 3M Tape is the usual way that people do this, and just put a little current of air across the heat sink there and that is another way to cool it down, even with the above treatment, for super low temps at the VREG.Here's another caveat, and I am asked this question all the time: Will a Megahalems CPU Cooler FIT with this board? With twin 25mm or 38mm fans? Answer: YES, a resounding YES it will fit! The fit is tight on the North Bridge Heat Sink and assembly, but with a little coaxing you are Golden! No issues there, ok? You CAN use the Megahalems CPU Cooler with this board, no sweat, no hill for a climber!Those are my simple tips for this board thus far, and I'll come back and answer any other questions if people have them for me-- so don't be shy if you have a question about the board and it's not any of the above questions, just ask here and I'll be notified and do my best to answer any other trick or interesting questions with regard to the 132-BL E758 boards. They are a good board, every board series has its quirks, this is not unique with respect to motherboards...they ALL have something weird that is unique to each one, THIS IS NO DIFFERENT! It doesn't mean they are bad boards, it just means what it is!EVGA has made a beautiful package here, they can run 12GB of RAM no sweat, they can run with the best of the CPU overclockers no sweat, and I have personally gone as high as 4528Mhz with my board, just for fun, ON AIR, no problem really, just wouldn't want to be doing it, going there 24/7. A good number on AIR is about the 4200Mhz area, which is do-able, easily with the right adjustments and CPU in the house, always you need a nice CPU to do such things, but it is possible to overclock these waaaay up there into the stratosphere!Have fun, and happy overclocking with the 132-BL-E758-X58 A1 SLI x 3 (WHEW!) Motherboards!Wavey Davey - Dec 1, 2009

$REVIEW.: I picked this combo up last night because I am in school and wanted to type on something other than laptop keys. I was able to go to the website and install the drivers for Windows 7 (not included on the disk yet) and immediately had a working keyboard and mouse. I place the adapter no more than a few feet from my computer, so I cannot attest for the range and quite frankly have no use for a keyboard and mouse across the house. The only thing I am not digging is the fact that I have to buy batteries to use this device, but other than this it's serving my purposes and I am glad I invested. It works just fine, in my opinion, but again I am only no more than 2 feet away from the adapter.

They're stiff, and for one or two keys here and there, it's negligible, but it's distracting and uncomfortable when trying to type more than a few words.  It's too bad.I've been careful to take care of my wrists because I always feel like I'm on the edge of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and using this keyboard makes them uncomfortable.  Why take that risk?  It's not worth it.  Back to the laptop keyboard for me.

$REVIEW.: This was my first real turntable, before this one I had a crappy sony turntable and a ok numark portable turntable (which worked pretty good) but I wanted a turntable with a adjustable tracking force and anti skate because my other turntables skipped around. So I bought this turntable in 2009 at a local record store. I honestly loved it but over time I got pretty tired of the humming sound when turned on. Another thing is that the anti skate isn't great on it. I did the test where you put a blank record on and adjusted the a.s. til it wouldn't move and I had to place it all the way at the 6 setting. I've read that this is somewhat common with this turntable. So you may want to check the anti skate when you first get this in to make sure everything is working right.

$REVIEW.: Adding to the review: I called Adams Electronics and complained about the "no trouble found" diagnosis when the HDMI was clearly not working. They agreed to take another look, and assigned to a more experienced technician (Steve). Steve reproduced the problem, which was intermittent, and replaced the HDMI board. It wasn't cheap - over $200, but they did give me credit for the initial $80, and paid for shipping the second time. The unit has been working uneventfully for three months now. I think the HDMI board died due to heat. It's the horizontal one sitting right at the top. There was always plenty of clearance above the vent, but it does get hot anyway. I now make sure that the whole area gets better ventilation. While disappointed in this design weakness, I'm happy to get the unit working again without spending a lot more on a new receiver.------------------------------------------------I bought this unit in 2007, and it worked well for four years. That's why it gets the second star.Then I started having problems with the HDMI inputs, and I put up with it for a year before shipping the box to Adam's Electronics in Huntingdon Beach, the authorized West Coast dealer.At the time I shipped the unit out, HDMI input 1 was completely non-functional, and Input 2 would pass video but no audio. Input 3 was OK.My setup includes a Sony BRD, A new (2012) Apple TV, an Oppo DVD, and a Dish 622 DVR. I tried swapping different units to the multiple inputs, and I tried two different TV at the output, with the same results.Adams charges $80 minimum to take the box in. After a couple of days they called me to say that there was no problem found, and that all the units worked with their test setup.After I received the box back I found that the symptoms were now different: all 3 inputs now pass video but no audio.Needless to say I'm ticked off: at Onkyo for having built this junk in the first place, and at Adams for not properly reproducing the problem - sounds like their test setup is very basic, it's just a cable box and a DVD player. When you service consumer electronics you better have a variety of things available to test against, because HDMI can be quite quirky.Now I have to choose between throwing more money at the problem, or call it quits and buy a replacement (non-Onkyo).

$review_text.: *Edit 01/10/11*Thanks to Amazon's Excellent Customer Service, I have exchanged the TV without problem. I will update my review once the new TV arrives. If the buzzing is gone, it should be a great one.I bought this TV based on an excellent personal review from a friend of mine and also the reviews here on Amazon. I read the negative reviews about the buzzing noise, but most said that it wasn't a problem once you had the volume up so I decided to order anyway.The picture is excellent. Games look incredible compared to LCD. Xbox 360 and Blu Ray are both far superior on this TV compared to the LG LED LCD that I purchased last week. It's so sad that I have to return the TV because of the horrible buzzing noise it produces. I can't for the life of me figure out how so many of you are able to ignore this problem. I mean, it's not just a noise, it's a high pitched squeal that rattles your brains. I've read that many people lose the ability to hear higher frequencies of sound with age and I can only imagine this is why some people can ignore this TV's flaw. It is a very high frequency pitch. Sitting 6 feet away, I can here it clearly. It only gets worse with Game or Vivid setting. I really wanted to try and get around this, because this TV is truly a beautiful picture, but after 3 days, it's too much for me to bear. I feel relieved every time I turn off the set. Perhaps Panasonic can market it as a way to get people to watch less TV.One other thing of note, I called Panasonic's support to ask for some help with the buzzing issue. They informed me at that time that the 42" TV only qualifies for "Walk in" warranty, meaning that you have to physically bring the 50lb TV to a local repair center. This may be difficult if you're like me and don't own a car. Just a heads up.edit: I just found this youtube video that explains the buzzing problem. [...]. It's caused by a loose screw on the circuit board. I just got mine, so I'll just ship for a replacement but it might help those of you out of warranty.

$REVIEW.: I had spent my first day with the HS20EXR and was generally very pleased with the functionality and performance.  Make no mistake, this is not a DSLR, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  This camera packs some capabilities and features that I would dream to have in one of my DSLRs.  Although it's not a large camera, for those who've used the HS10, you'll already know that the build feels solid and the handling is somewhat like a smaller DSLR.  The menu system is fairly easy to navigate and more common functions, like exposure, focus, and flash modes are easily accessible via dedicated controls.  Be prepared to spend an hour or so getting familiar with the controls and menus - it may be intimidating if you're brand new to this type camera, but most experienced photographers will pick it up quickly.A couple of early concerns materialized.  First, I experience the temperature warning display that has been noted in some early reviews.  However, I didn't see any degradation in performance even with the warning lit.  Upon calling Fujifilm, they quickly sent a replacement and I'm happy to say the problem didn't reoccur to that extent, but later I experienced temp warnings in warmer and more continuous use conditions.  Another minor irritant while shooting was that the display froze for a moment while focus was obtained.  If shooting a moving object, this could mean the difference in getting or not getting the shot.  After some further testing, I discovered that this problem seemed related to the "Multi" focus mode.  I did not experience the same degree of delay in Center, Area, or Tracking modes.The flexibility in shooting is remarkable, given the standard PSAM controls, plus some really interesting advanced features, there's few still shooting situations the camera will not handle.  Those extras I found very appealing are the EXR High-ISO/Low Noise (SN mode), the Pro Low-Light modes.  In SN priority mode, I was able to shoot at higher sensitivities up to ISO 1600 with very low noise and even ISO 3200 was very usable.  I'm sure I'll get flack for this, but I have to admit some shooting modes outperformed my D300.  I believe this has more to do with the HS20's high ISO performance than general lens clarity or image detail, in which most DSLRs excel. The Pro Low-Light mode is another trick-up-the-sleeve that combines 4 exposures taken in rapid succession into one very low noise image even in very dim light.Not surprisingly, the HS20 autofocus did seek a little in low light, but not much more than my DSLRs in the same setting.  The zoom lens was impressive for such a small package and both wide and full zoom shots were crisp.  There are many more modes and options, but none of these bells and whistles would mean much if the end results didn't deliver.  Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised at the sharpness of the full sized 16MP images - I really expected to see a lot of artifacts from noise reduction and other in-camera processing.  On the contrary, my "pixel peeping" revealed clean edges and very good fine detail.  Pictures of my cat actually show individual fine hairs instead of the painterly effect of some compact cameras.  It seems like Fuji took lessons from predecessors and managed to squeeze more image quality out of their tiny sensor than many of us expected.One of the cool benefits of the CMOS sensor is speed.  Once I figured out the continuous shooting modes, I was tickled at being able to fire off 8 fps in full resolution.  I also played with the 11 fps mode which works with at 8MP and felt like I was shooting an old movie camera instead of a point and shoot digital.One issue of concern to me was the processing speed or write speed of the files to the card.  This was a common complaint for the HS10.  What I found was that the write speed is improved, but don't expect DSLR performance.  A JPEG Fine image would write to card in under 1 second to my SanDisk Extreme Pro, and a RAW file averaged 4 seconds.  Now before you say "WHAT?", let me explain that that is the write time itself, HOWEVER, due to the internal cache, the camera is ready for the next shot in less time than the write time.  I found that generally it was ready almost instantly shooting JPEG and with RAW, there might be a second or two delay for an individual image.  In burst mode, the camera was able to cache all images in the burst without pausing, although after capturing the images, the write time again took 4-6 seconds depending on the image sizes.  So not a perfect situation, but definitely an improvement over the noted problems of the HS10.The video was very easy to use and looks acceptable for simple scenes at wide to normal viewing angles.  At full zoom, images were shaky and focus was slow.  Plan on using a tripod for long zooms, and careful zooms and panning.  With the manual zoom barrel, which is really geared toward still photography, zooms can be awkward during video recording, without the smoothness of the typical motorized zoom.  The video issues were not a big deal to me since the features that attracted me to the camera were for still images.One area that is still a minor irritant is the electronic viewfinder.  It is still pretty low resolution and is difficult see small details in your scene.  Given a bright outdoor scene, it does allow composition without fighting the glare on the LCD, but it seems like they could have could have packed a little more resolution in there to make it more useable.  That problem is offset somewhat by the articulating LCD screen.  It allows you to view from odd angles and with a little extra manipulation you can usually get a clear image even outdoors.Another minor nit pick is the inclusion of alkaline batteries with the kit.  Not only do alkalines not last very long with this camera, they actually heat up during use possibly contributing to some of the temperature issues.  I quickly replaced them with NiMH Eneloops and surprisingly, the camera's operation actually sped up noticably.  If you buy this camera, invest in some good rechargeable NiMH batteries - you'll be much happier.The software accompanying the camera is not impressive, but it does what it needs to.  It comes with picture management software Finepix Studio so you can view and organize your images.  It also includes a RAW file converter (Silkypix) which allows you to adjust and save captured RAW images as TIF or JPEG images.  Adobe Camera Raw didn't initially recognize the HS20's RAW format, but is now supported so if you are used to the Adobe workflow, you'll be happier with Adobe Camera Raw.On day one, I took a liking to this camera and gave it a starting rating of four stars.  As I got more familiar with the HS20, I've posted sample images and video and links to these can be found in the attached comments.  Although I've identified some issues that could be improved, this camera actually exceeds my expectations for a point and shoot.  I can capture images that rival an entry-level DSLR, and not have to carry around 20 pounds of equipment (camera body, wide and telephoto lenses, tripod, etc.).  The HS20EXR more than meets my desire for a relatively small travel or hiking camera that still has good reach and image quality.  If I could, I'd give a rating of about 4.6 stars.  I don't love everything about the camera, but as a whole, it's fun to use and a great photo-taking machine for the price.Pros: Shooting speed, low light performance, image quality, flexible shooting controls, massive sharp zoom rangeCons:  Slow autofocus/instability during video, low quality EVF, display lag on shutter releaseUPDATE - April 19th, 2011:  Firmware update to address the temp warning.  Everything else is working fine.UPDATE - April 29th, 2011:  Adobe Camera Raw now supports EXR RAW files.  Great news!

$review_text.: When I bought my new Surface Tablet, I was appalled at how poorly the &#34;touch cover&#34; feels when trying to type even a short message
 The key feedback is the worst ever experienced
 I touch type so responsive keys are important to me

 When I bought my Surface, it was mandatory to get the touch cover as it was part of the package; now after three months, one can buy the same tablet without a keyboard, freeing one up to buy the keyboard of choice


 So, I'm stuck with a $100 cover for my Surface which has hunt-and-peck typing capability; I still haven't figured out how to right click the mouse pad on the darn thing!  Anyway, what I suggest is that anyone who buys a Surface...don't bother with either of the covers unless you don't mind spending $50 more than the most expensive matching cover for an iPad
 Buy this little jewel instead
 The Bluetooth immediately  couples with the Surface and the typing feel is great

 Logitech just makes good Bluetooth keyboards period

$REVIEW.: There are many different niches for headphones-- audiophile, noise-canceling, portable, exercise, casual listening, etc.  I am not entirely sure what Sennheiser was trying to do here.The physical design itself is pretty close to the Bose OE2 model.  The pads are cheaper, and they don't fold down the way the Bose OE2 does, but the weight and feel are similar.  At a little over 1/3 the price of the Bose OE2, though, it should be no surprise that the sound quality isn't even close, and even the bass doesn't live up to Sennheiser's advertisement.  Overall, I found the sound of the 229's to be slightly tinny, and lacking in depth compared to the OE2's.  Interestingly, the Sennheiser 448's that I bought for around $80 have sound quality comparable to the Bose OE2 (for about half the price!).  Those 448's have far better sound than the 229's, which aren't dramatically cheaper than my 448's were when I bought them.  Unfortunately, though, it looks like Sennheiser may have jacked up the price of the 448's since then.  The 229's are smaller, and lighter, so the tradeoff is sound quality for comfort and a price break.  OK, fair enough.  Some people care more about comfort.  However, the price of these phones clearly reflects the fact that the sound quality is lower than from the better-known Sennheiser models.So, what purpose do these serve?  These are definitely not for audiophiles.  The sound quality is better than the ear buds that come for free with your iPod, but Sennheiser makes no pretense to call these high-end cans.  They aren't noise-canceling phones.  The ear pads swivel, but they don't fold, which makes them only slightly portable.  I wouldn't do a serious workout with these-- for that you need the things that clip around your ears.  They are comfortable, and I suppose that if you are listening to compressed audio files as background music, they are a decent pick at a far lower price than the higher quality stuff that Sennheiser generally sells.  If you want a comfortable pair of budget headphones, these will do, but don't expect miracles for $60.

 The signal strength / range is good and I can get a reliable connection from anywhere in my house


 The advertised 300 Mbps is only possible between two wireless devices and not from a wire to a wireless device due to the 10/100 Mbps Ethernet connection

 This is typically not an issue because the 300 Mbps is a theoretical limit that is hard to reach in practice and 100 Mbps is fast enough for most uses, including streaming HD video.Final Thoughts:Great buy for a low cost router.-Sammy_K

$REVIEW.: Pros:1) Price (under $28 when bought but today under $27).2) Noise is acceptable (I also got CM922's 3 big fans + eVGA 9800GT fan).Cons:1) Too much work for upgrade, OK if you build new but installation required you to take the whole system apart.2) Size. It's not extra big, but taller than OCZ OCZTVEND Vendetta that I owned (BTW I got it on-sale $7.50! after rebate). Bearly made it with MSI 890GXM-G65 microATX MB - the FAN is VERY close to the RAM. That's another reason I prefer ATX MB.Stock heat sink: 26C idle, 52C while runnng Prime95 (AMD Phenom x 4 955 BE stock 3.2 GHz). If no OC I think stick with stock HS should be OK!CM Hyper 212+: 24 - 26C idle (room temp maybe higher today), 44C whle running Prime95 (OC to 3.6 GHZ)The result is acceptable base on the fact all cores are 100% loaded. I'm looking for 37 - 38C so got bit disappointed.IMO many after market CPU coolers are overpriced. I got the CPU (955BE) for about $100 (MSI MB combo deal) so not willing to spend $50 - 60 just for the cooler. Same theory there is no way to spend $200K - 250K to remodel a $400K house.I'm a long time AMD CPU user. Although this is my first time to use AMD stock heatsink, I can tell just by see to justify the quality (and that's why I never used stock heatsink before this).The 955BE's stock heatsink is defintely better than any previous version of other models but AMD should do better. BE version CPU desreve more, why AMD expect people buy their Black Edition CPU but discourage them to overclock is still a joke to me. (Discourage = warranty get void and bundle with so-so stock heat sink) Luckily Subaru didn't void my warranty after I took my WRX over 130 mph.AMD product's price/performance is better than Intel, I just hope their marketing people is smarter.

I do a lot of travel and i needed a small footprint but large capacity external HD and this is the one I have been waiting for
 Previously I had been used a LaCie 250GB which was larger in size and also need to have an external power supply


 the LaCie drive external power supply is not only bulky but a pain in trying to connect to the drive and carry around
 Further the whole drive broke down after a few months


 It was hard to find an external drive which is small in footprint, large in capacity, and DO NOT require an external power supply


 Finally thanks to Western Digital, they now have it


 I am happy with everyhing thus far

 The only con i can find are - the rubber cover for the mini USB connection could be a bit early to break off and also a bit fragile


 Also the black shing surface shines but could scratches easily


 It is best to have a case to go along with it
 I am now trying a "amentities bag" I got from Northwest Business Class and I put the socks they gave you inside, and then the drive and the USB cord


 Seems to protect the drive very well


 Overall excellent product for the 1 month i have been using it, thus far.

I especially like being able to have four separate cases or one or more of them connected together in a pair.  Nice to be able to have the two different colors. The present way I have mine set up is to have the 2 orange cases connected together filled with 8 NiMH AA batteries and the green cases connected together filled with 12 NiMH AAA batteries.  At a later time as I become used to this system I may connect a green case to an orange case and put the fully charged batteries in the green case with the discharged batteries in the orange case.  I like the choices. Sure beats loose batteries rolling around in a bag or in a drawer!At present I am giving the low self discharge NiMN batteries a try after having giving up on NiMH batteries because of their here to fore high self discharge rate. We use a ton of AAA and AA batteries around here.  Should these new type of NiMH batteries prove to be more practical then the ones I previously dealt with,  I will buy more of them along with more BATUCA battery cases.P.S. I experienced no difficulty installing both the AAA and the AA batteries with the positive terminal up or with the negative terminal up.  They went in both ways with no problems getting them in or out as well as closing and snapping the lid firmly shut.

$review_text.: I was looking for a compact umbrella bracket speedlight mount. I currently used a combination of a larger bracket with screw on shoes/remotes that would mount the flash. They worked, but were bulky, made of plastic and sometimes the shoe would come loose. These brackets are not the best made, there is slop in the cut threads and screws for the most part which can cause the screws to bind at times.However, they are small, appear to be made of aluminum, hold their position securely, and include a fixed cold shoe which is perfect.I had one major defect that affected all 5 brackets I purchased. The thumb screw that secures the bracket to a light stand would not firmly tighten down. The plastic knob would spin on the metal threads as if the threads were not fixed inside the knob. I am awaiting a response to see if the manufacturer will send me replacement working thumb screws.UPDATE: The seller/manufacturer was quick to reply to my concern and ship me out an additional bracket for parts. This did not address the concern that all 5 knobs wouldn't tighten, but as I was able to crudely fix the knobs, this was a fair compensation for my time. I am satisfied.

I did try out the phone and my girlfriend said it sounded like she was on speaker phone, but all in all I have no need to make calls in the shower so this wasn't any set back.The one caveat is that the rubber seal that closes off the charging port doesn't fit in the port properly. The seal is too small and will slip out unless placed in the port just right, which then leaves this part open to water damage. This does leave me concerned about the life of this speaker, but a month in and it's still doing well. When SoundBot finds a way to correct this they will have a perfect product.

Smoothing it down with the edge of a credit card doesn't help. Picking it up to realign makes for more air bubbles. Maybe if I massage it... It seems to adhere alright for the time being mit bubbles. What a pain. I expect one of these days to find the screen shield loose in my pocket from the edge being picked up. What a pain. Not good.

Goes on clear, really can't tell that there on the device.The only con is there is a sticker that is hard to remove, and once removed, it leaves a sticky residue on the screen, which is almost impossible to get rid of.

$review_text.: I am now a firm believer in SSDs. I didn't see what was so great about them till I installed this one in my personal rig.I did a fresh Win 7 load. This was the fastest OS install I have ever seen, and i have seen several of them, due to that being part of my job.The deal I got on this drive was great, $60 for a freaky fast OS. Almost all my old utilities and programs are installed on it and it still runs great.I've used up about 75% of the 120 GB though. But that was to be expected.Sadly, installing my games and putting my data on my old 2TB is still slower, but it is an older HDD, so that it to be expected also.I highly recommend this product.I love it only taking 22 sec from power press to being able to use all functionality of my computer. Down from about 2 minutes 30 seconds from my old HDD,

$review_text.: I used this case for a couple of months with my m-atx build I had. For the most part, the features this case comes with is fantastic. A lot of room inside, great cooling capabilities, and yet can fit in small places. The problem with the case though is the quality of it. The metal is extremely flimsy and easy to bend. You don't even have to try.Also the side panel 200m fan mount can only mount NZXT 200m fan only. If you want to use any other 200m fan you have to attach it with zip ties.

Windows 7 x64 recognized it and installed drivers without me ever having to put in the driver cd that came with it.With my Dell Latitude e6500, it's completely flush with the side, doesn't stick out at all.Pulling videos off my SanDisk Extreme III 8gb card, the windows copy progress window shows (and shifts) from 29MB/sec to 34MB/sec.  The card says it's 30MB/sec, so that makes sense and it's nice the card reader gives me the fastest throughput possible.Using my Express Card slot gives me a certain geeky satisfaction too.UPDATE-I'm now using the express reader with a SanDisk Extreme 16gb, 60MB/s and the reader is keeping up perfectly.  I get 60MB/sec transfer rates.  Now to get the 90MB/sec one...

$REVIEW.: The most notable attribute mentionable is the sheer force behind this device. Unlike the Pocket PC operating system (OS), this little Zaurus is running an embedded distribution of the Linux OS. Need I say more? The possibilities are endless. Sharp hosts a great Internet site that's for application distribution and support. It's at myzaurus.com. Here you can get applications, updates and documents. You can download the console for running terminal commands.There were a few quirks that I experienced with loading application packages. There is an auto-reboot after you finish installing a package or a group of packages on the device. I could not get the Zaurus to recognize more packages after the first reboot. Without looking into it more, I loaded as many packages as I could at once, and then let it do the auto-reboot.If you have a problem with the system that a software restart does not fix, you can reset the system to factory defaults quite easily, and restore from backups. The procedures are clearly documented in the manuals that accompany the device.The sync worked as well as I could expect. I did not try the Intellisync software on my desktop because the instruction manual stated that only one of the two sync software choices can be installed on your PC system at one time.Personally, I love using this PDA. Everything you need is built-in. The fact that you have support for both SD memory and CF memory cards opens so many doors for expansion. The onboard mini QWERTY keyboard is outstanding. There is a software keyboard and text recognition application that comes with it as well. Just the games that came loaded on the unit displays its superior graphics capabilities.I tested my IPAQ with the Pocket PC 2k2 OS, and the Zaurus on my friends wife, who knows nothing about computers, to see which she thought was more intuitive to use for basic word editing, solitaire, etc. She was lost on the Zaurus. She didn't like the text recognizer on the Zaurus, but found the Pocket PC text recognizing software much easier to use. The text recognition software on the Zaurus is not as forgiving as the Pocket PC version, or you have to train it to your handwriting style. Overall she did much better using the Pocket PC.Generally, I would rate the Zaurus as being more geared towards the advanced computer user, or someone that is good at reading manuals and taking the time to learn. If you want a good "no-brainer" PDA then I would recommend a Palm or Pocket PC.

$REVIEW.: So here is the delima,Though this IS the cheapest 4k television on the market today, why should it matter seeing that there is virtually little to no 4k content.  None of my current streaming devices support it and to buy another streaming device that would support it will cost hundreds of dollars.So why do i like this tv then, well for starters i got it at an unbelievable price, (didn't even spend $500 on it & i got 2 years free financing), 2nd i plan on using this today as a tv but eventually this will be a main desktop monitor for my pc rig.I already tested this as a pc monitor and as long as your not dealing with color specific content, (photo/video editing) this is a VERY cheap high resolution LARGE screen monitor.  I can put 4 x 1080p videos on 1 desktop!.In my opinion if your looking for a true 4k tv, you should be spending a little more to get a better quality set.  Yeah both tv's will have the same lines of resolution however its the engine inside the box that pushes the color/quality that are a great deal different.  If your looking for a tv, well even at the cheap price i bought this, i could have bought many different quality brand 40&#34; 1080p tv's (samsung, LG, Sony) that would have yielded a much higher quality picture at the more widely accepted format of 1080p.I would seriously only consider this tv if you wanted to use it as a desktop monitor & you didn't have to worry about color representation.  Dont think by me talking about color that this tv doesn't look good.  it does look &#34;good&#34; however those that are in the area of &#34;photography&#34; or truly understand &#34;color gamuts&#34; when I pair this 39&#34; 4k monitor against my Asus ProArt 24&#34; monitor, i can instantly see a difference in the color and my 24&#34; is on the money.  (though i did calibrate the Seiki and it helped it a little but still not as good as the Asus).  Also though i'm not a gamer, with my basic understanding in what makes a good gaming monitor, you would have to dumb down the resolution to 1080p to gain the higher frequency rates (this is not a 4k & 120Hz monitor, it goes down to 30Hz).  So if that is the case, its better to spend the money on a monitor that is built towards gamers.update; i even paired this Seiki against a cheapo 40&#34; tv that i bought for my sister and when it come to hooking up my Fios & Xbox 360, the quality was pretty much the same and the Cheapo tv (sold on amazon, B00AEP8TG8) is half the cost of this Seiki tv.

Everyone who comes over and sees it in action has gone back an purchased one for themselves - its that good :) Even the wife love it - and actually plays around with it!! nuff said.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Have been playing with it for 3 weeks now ..


the sheer joy of rediscovering your music - can't be put to words ...Detailed review on my blog - [...]Excerpts from my review -...The sheer brilliance of the design is that the remote has a screen!!!...It is like having an Ipod/Music-player in your hand with1


Infinite capacity - as much as you want to have on your computer2
Wireless music transmission and remote - completely WiFi so no pointing at anything!3

Instantaneous Lyrics browser - yep there is this plugin which finds the lyrics for the song playing and also scrolls automatically with the song!!4


Wireless RSS reader5
Internet Radio player6


Podcast player7


Expandable - I can add as many receivers as I want ..

and they all can synchronize to play the same music OR - hold your breath - play their own streams ..

so I could be listening to Led Zeppelin in the living room and D could be listening to The Beatles in the bedroom!8
Fully customizable software and firmware - yep the Squeezecenter (the server software) is open-source - so boatloads of plugins and goodies updated daily - it's a programmers dream (makes me want to start programming!!) and god bless all those programming souls out there that write so many cool plugins for everyone to use .Get this - they are writing new firmware features and plugins for the Controller as we speak - essentially enabling more cool features on your hardware - how do you beat that!!! The sheer excitement that every software release is going to make your hardware more cool just cannot be explained ..

Now that's definitely a first!! Yaaaaaaaaaaay! Shame on you Apple - look and learn - your stupid firmware update pretty much made my Ipod Classic a no-video device - pfffffffffffft!! (ya ya - before you Apple lovers scream like little girls I know that I can buy an Apple docking station to output video to my TV ..

I have one question ..
WHY? how dare they tie me down to one stupid hardware when there are so many better ones out there :P ..

$review_text.: I am having a love/hate relationship with this Belkin Quilted Cover for the iPad mini.  On the positive side, it is very attractive.  The quilted vinyl is very feminine looking, and the black color is understated and elegant.  The stitching is all done very well, and it looks more like a nice planner than an iPad case.  Each corner of the iPad mini is held in by a hard plastic piece, which I think would protect that vulnerable area in the event of a drop.  The case doubles as a stand if you want to sit it up on a table, or use it as a stand in your lap.Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives for me.  The case is heavy.  According to my digital kitchen scale, the iPad mini itself weighs 10.76 ounces.  This Belkin case weighs 7.94 ounces.  So by adding the case, the weight of the iPad mini almost doubles.  The case is also very bulky.  I did not measure, but I would estimate that it almost quadruples the thickness of the svelte iPad mini.  The surprising thing to me is that the case does not work with the magnetic on/off feature of the iPad mini.  Even the least expensive cases I have seen have this feature.  That is my primary reason for only rating this product at 3 stars.If you mostly use your iPad mini at home, then I would recommend this case.  However, my main reason for purchasing an iPad mini was to carry in my purse.  I already have a full sized iPad to use inside my home, and I do not care if that one is a bit heavy.  While this Belkin case is very attractive, the bulk and weight that it adds defeats my reason for buying a small and light device to carry on a daily basis.  I still have the case on, but will probably revert soon to using theMoKo Ultra Slim Lightweight Smartshell Stand Case for Apple iPad Mini 7.9-Inch Tablet, BLACK (with Smart Cover Auto Wake/Sleep)that I purchased here on Amazon.  That particular case offers minimal protection, but it is very thin and light, which meets my personal requirements for an iPad mini case.

Honestly, knowing what I know now about it, I would pay more for it. It is incredible for a small compact subwoofer. The bass gets low but is tight and not boomy at all. It is easy to set it just right for a small to midsize room. I would buy it again in a heartbeat and I would not hesitate to recommend it to a friend.

The radio works ok, but I wouldn't buy it again

The weather radio does work, I'm about 7 miles from the transmitter and live on a hilltop, but it takes a good minute to finally tune in the proper frequency for my local weather

And then it has low volume, with a fully charged radio battery
It would be ok in an extended emergency I guess.

$REVIEW.: 4 stars for a great device; 1 less star because it was hard to set up


 I purchased this by itself because I already had a Wii U and a balance board
 Had to call Nintendo, where the guy I talked to was looking it up in manuals and not familiar with it at all

Finally figured it out
 Nintendo should have appropriate documentation in the package with how to set it up in different situations.Working great, syncs easily to my Wii U - others have had problems, but really all you do is point it at the infrared section at the top of the Wii U Console and hold the button until the TV screen tells you it is synced.


$review_summary.: Once I got it set up it was fine.

$review_text.: Purchased one about 2 months ago. My wife, who did 99% of her work on the internet, always had problems with her Windows Vista laptop; you know, updates, java updates, adobe updates, anti virus updates, etc.  Programs installing toolbars without permission, changing default programs. Really was annoying for her and for me having to always fixing problems. At least twice a week. I always thought that a computer for the average person should be like and appliance; &#34;turn it on and it just works&#34;.After the initial setup which took about 15 minutes she logging into her gmail account. Almost instantly all her information was there. Email, Contacts, Calendar, Pictures and all her saved favorites or bookmarks. Then I set her up with Google Cloud Print which works great. Almost two months and she hasn't asked for help once.This is a function of it being a Chromebook and probably would be the same on any Chromebook. But I've bought many Acer products and have always been happy.  I'm very happy with this Acer C720. Its very light and has a long battery life. Instant on and shut down and a great price.

$review_text.: I just got this unit as a Christmas gift for myself, and I must say that I love it.  I mainly chose Sirius for Stern and Radio Margaritaville, and so far I have not been disappointed with any of the programming.As for the unit itself.  It mounts in a snap.  I was able to install the antena on my SUV and effectively route the cable to the front of the vehicle.  The suction cup mount works well, although it has fallen off a couple of times when I unclick the unit from the mounting bracket.  Not a big deal, and it may be caused by me not fully installing it properly.  The unit does get very hot, which is a slight concern of mine, but I have read reviews where they say to turn the brightness down and it helps a bit.  The buttons seem a little cheap to me, which is also another slight concern of mine, since I change channels a lot, and I'm worried about durability.Overall, it's a great unit.  Sound quality is what I expected, not bad, but not CD quality, but tons better than what I got out of my iTrip transmitter (that thing sucked) for my iPod.  I highly recommend this for anyone thinking about satellite radio.

$REVIEW.: The camera is a great size for carrying everywhere

No, it's not something a National Geographic photographer would rely on full time, but it comes in very handy when dimensions and weight are important


Photos come out fine in the auto mode, although its functions can be easily customized for a variety of lighting situations


I particularly like the fact that it has a viewfinder since I'm most used to shooting that way

I also like that the display at the back can be turned off when using just the viewfinder

Don't know yet how much of a battery pirate it is; it takes 2 alkaline AA which are easy to install

Unfortunately, though, there is no battery level display, so keep a spare set close by


Supposedly, though, an on-screen icon or message indicates when barrereis are nearly depleted


Overall, the A1400 is pretty user-friendly


I probably will purchase a waterproof case for when I take it kayaking
One major complaint: Included instructions are woefully incomplete
I had to go to Canon's website to find a comprehensive manual, which I downloaded -- took a lot of time, ;ink and 123 sheets of paper
Bummer!!! At purchase I also was led to believe a USB cable was included
It was not

Amazon, however, sold me one and did not charge for shipping it


Owners also need to purchase a memory card

I got a Transcend 16GB SDHC Flash care and am pleased with it so far

I also bought a Case Logic DBC-302 soft case for added protection when the camera is not in use


It fits the A1400 perfectly, and there's also a pocket for extra batteries

I definitely would recommend this camera to others.

$REVIEW.: I was very disappointed with this product's performance in real life conditions.  The product performed well as far as delivering a signal that my antennae could pick up and play in the desired radio station.  However, I was not able to find a static/noise free station in my area.My recommendation before purchasing this product is to figure out whether you can tune in to a static/noise free station in your area.  Keep in mind that whatever noise or static you pick up will be superimposed on the signal coming from the this Monster Cable when you play your iPOD.

I bought this to see if I could go from my sub 1 bar interior coverage in my cube


I put the antenna on the top of the cube, moved things around until the light went from red to green, and have had drop free calls all day

It works

When I put my iPhone into diagnostic mode, its moving my signal from -105 to about -80, which seems to correlate with three bars

Well, now I dont have to worry about that. This little contraption is VERY neat...it softens and fills in the spaces that the regular built in flash cant always get. It also softens skin quite a bit.I even have put my speedlight on, and still had this, and am like wow, this is pretty neat. sometimes you dont have a wall to bounce off of, or a ceiling is vaulted. this little contraption is neat, bc i can have it straight on people, but with the diffuser on it, it takes away from the harshness and i dont have to worry about the flash being overly bright. Overall, this is a VERY NEAT contraption for a SUPER SMALL PRICE. Itll be nice to have at wedding gigs.

I have used many different brands in different quantities of rechargeable batteries, with various mAh ratings and found that Lenmar performs. It outlasts many major brands that claims a higher mAh rating without spending $$$ on the name. Do yourself a favor, if you purchase batteries use them right away and if they don't last long (within reason), return them. I've wasted a lot of $$$, hopefully I can save you some.

$review_text.: Have had this for a few days now so thought I would put my two cents in. I am an IT Specialist with 30 years experience (17 in networking) so I know what I am doing :)After some grief during setup on my wireless network the radio is now working well. I was having major issues with the music cutting in and out, or network not found messages after I connected the Grace radio to my network. My Apple Airport Extreme (newest Gen.) is in the same room as the radio. After doing many different things to try to resolve the issues (i.e. moving the radio, moving my wireless router) I eventually found the reason for the network issue. It seems my bluetooth dongle and/or bluetooth headphones on my home desktop PC (in the same room as the Grace radio) were giving this radio fits and was responsible for the wireless issues. As soon as I unplugged the usb bluetooth dongle and turned off the bluetooth headphones the wireless connection became rock solid and has been solid since. So, for any of you having intermittent connection issues you may want to look there as it seems the radio does not like bluetooth dongles close to the radio and causes interference on the radio's wifi signal.As many others have stated  the interface is pretty archaic but I do not mind the &#34;old school&#34; look and feel of this unit. Using a remote,or even better using the iPhone/Android App solves any of these problems and and makes it easy to store your favorites. The LCD display mostly sucks because it is a very low resolution lcd display. The characters look a little fuzzy and it would be nice if they were oing to use a small old school display like this that at least they used one with better resolution. At least they display the bit rate of the stations on the lcd display so you can see at a glance the quality of music you will receive from each station.I find the sound to be good but not great (from internal speakers). Bass/Treble controls do help but the best way to enjoy the sound on these is to hook up external speakers using the speaker terminals or line out in back. I hooked up some nice efficient speakers to the speaker terminals and the sound is extremely good this way. The nice 16 watt class D amp in these is fully utilized using external speakers and I am verry happy with the sound now. Can turn the radio up almost all the way with no perceivable distortion and it definitely cranks with external speakers. having separate speakers also open up the stereo sound stage so this helps quite a bit.All in all this Internet radio is very good. Just dont expect perfection for $150 bucks and you will be happy.

If you think you can or will get support from Creative, you'd be wrong. There is no number to call. Your "support" is done via e-mail, with no one to talk to. I have had no luck with Sound Blaster products at all. The drivers for Vista are problematic and unless you are computer technically proficient (by that I mean an expert because I am fairly proficient)you will be on your own. The product worked well under XP but there have been nothing but problems with the Vista. I don't have Windows 7 yet so I don't know if the driver problems are corrected. The sound and functionality were great for a while, but I don't like paying this much for a sound card that only lasted about a year and a half.

$review_text.: UPDATE: my keyboard died after 1 year, and trying to get the manufacturer to honor their warranty was like ripping teeth. Definitely would not buy again. now onto my original review...I got a new laptop recently (see my Toshiba Qosmio review) and have it hooked up to my 50" plasma TV. I matched that setup with a Gyration Air Music Remote with Compact Keyboard and the experience of a Home Theater PC is nothing short of revolutionary. Why everyone isn't doing this already, I'll never know -- it's taken both my computer and TV experience to a whole new level of entertainment. The only real problem though, was my wireless keyboard. The Gyration Air Remote is still a "must have" that I couldn't live without, but the keyboard was problematic and often skipped letters as I typed. It also became clear that I'd prefer a full size keyboard that was backlit so it would be easier to use in dim lighting.Enter the Eclipse Wireless Litetouch Keyboard!I've had my eye on the Litetouch for the past month, eagerly waiting its release date. I since learned it was all the rage at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, which only got me even more excited. Visually, the Litetouch was exactly what I was looking for and I was hoping it lived up to the hype. The verdict?? It DOES!Full Size KeyboardUnlike the Gyration keyboard, the Litetouch has a traditional keypad layout, full size keys, and their function is both tactile and responsive. This doesn't feel like a cheapo clackety-clack keyboard. It's a well constructed quality product. The keys aren't exactly silent, but they don't make a lot of noise either. And best of all, I'm typing this review on it now, and the wireless signal is flawless; no skipped letters, delays or errors. Just smooth, responsive and accurate typing.Customizable Touch Screen Number PadA great twist to this keyboard is the number pad on the right is actually a touch screen panel. It can be changed to 3 different screens and even has programmable keys that can be set to open your favorite web pages, launch music players, or even open programs on your computer. Just switch between the 3 screens to select the touch pad you want and off you go; a cool feature that increases the versatility of this keyboard tenfold. However, it would've been a nice touch if the keys could take custom images or text to give a totally custom experience. But as it is, it's pretty great none the less.Backlit Keys!!My Qosmio has them, and I tell ya, there's no going back. Backlit keys may sound like no big deal to those who have never had it, but trust me, it's the best. The backlighting on this Litetouch dims automatically to conserve power. I haven't timed it, but I'd say it stays lit a good couple minutes before it dims. Then it stays dim a while longer before going totally dark. But just touch any key, and it lights up right away and is ready to type with no lag time. The touch pad also has a manual dim button as well as volume control.RechargeableThe touch pad also displays the battery level, and the keyboard seems to hold a charge a good while. I'm going on 48 hours and the battery is still at full capacity; so good on that.Built-In Trackball & Left/Right Mouse ButtonsI truly don't see this replacing my Gyration Air Remote, but it's cool to have a trackball and mouse buttons right under the touch pad. The trackball is responsive and smooth, and I do make use of it from time to time, but once you get used to the Gyration Air Mouse, there's just no going back. But I am glad the trackball is there because sometimes it's more convenient. I just wish the trackball itself also doubled as the left mouse button, similar to the trackball on a cell phone. It's much more intuitive to roll away with the trackball and then just click it. The left mouse button could then be programmed for something else. Maybe they'll incorporate this into the next generation Litetouch.Custom User ProfilesSave custom profiles for your programmable buttons. I originally thought you had to load the custom profiles manually after each boot, but I've since found the solution: right click the Eclipse Wireless Litetouch Keyboard icon in the tray on the lower right, then right click your Saved profile, then click Load at Startup. Whew! Glad it works as it should, even if the info was hard to find. It should be automatic that once you create a saved profile, it automatically loads at startup without any extra steps.Bottom Line -- this Eclipse keyboard is exactly what's been missing from my HTPC setup. It looks sleek and feels like a top quality product. I have every expectation that it will last a good while. The price isn't cheap, but not exorbitant either. This is the best wireless keyboard I've come across. Go for it; you won't be disappointed!

$REVIEW.: I never buy a product without reviews however this camera was reviewed on another website at 4 stars
I came here as the price was [...]better.First let me say I am a complete noob at CCTV and I simply got this out of more curiosity than security hence the lowest price camera I could find.Let me say this little camera is worth its weight in gold

Of course it could be due to the fact that I wasn't expecting much "you get what you pay for" not so with this little gem
It's a great picture!It's certainly works best during the day but the night vision isn't worthless
The day picture is clear and though the colors are a bit off green looks more like baby blue, you can certain see what's going on

It also gets a great angle view as I have mine set up in  the hallway and can see half of my kitchen and all of my living room, front door and entrance to my office


All in all about 16 x 20 area.The night vision is grainy at best but eh "you get what you pay for" in this category lol
You can still make out images but just imagine it with snow.I have bought 2 and I will certainly grab two more as my DVR card holds up to four
Of course this isn't a Vegas eye in the sky but I believe you will be pleased

I will update a few pictures once I get them all up and running.Happy Buying

$review_text.: The problem with the Toshiba XD-E500 (KU) is not that it plays DVDs badly, it is that almost everything else about it ruins my experience.The "good stuff":I was excited when I opened the box and held this very thin, handsome DVD player. It has nice buttons on the front of the case..they did not have a loud "circuit-board-bubble" click like very cheap units do.The DVD laser access is quick. The "Next scene" and "Next chapter" access is quick and nimble. It has multiple fast forward speeds and seems to "stop on a dime" in that respect. And the picture quality seems fine.Now for the "bad stuff":1. There is only ONE audio output jack (L/R) on the back. This means I can only hook up the the audio to my television set, but not be able to send another signal to my stereo receiver. My old entry-level Sony DVD player, which this unit replaced since my Sony broke after 6 years faithful service, has 2 audio outputs.2. There is no chapter detail on the LED readout on the front of the unit. It only displays the current chapter. This is not enough information. For comparison, my old entry level Sony had Chapter + Time Into, or optionally Chapter + Time Remaining. To Toshiba's credit, the information is viewable from the "Display" button on the remote control, which I'll get to in a minute. However, the Display button displays a screen readout that is difficult to read. Here is the actual display text for a movie I have in the unit right now:"Time 00:06:49/02:11:42". As you might agree, it is not formatted well. I should be able to "glance" at the screen, and immediately know the time position, but the XD-E500 makes me parse out the spaceless information.3. The Eject disc takes way too long. It takes about 3 times longer than my entry level Sony DVD player to eject a disk because the XD-E500 "thinks" for a while.4. The remote control is mediocre and cheap. The buttons are almost all the same size in one contiguous grid, requiring much too much visual inspection to find the right button (think dark room while watching a movie), whereas my entry level Sony DVD player has "sections" of buttons of different sizes.5. The remote control has no volume control. If you think you won't mind being forced to keep in proximity two remotes -- one for your TV, and one for your DVD player -- at all times including when you move around your living room, think again. When a loud DVD scene comes on the screen, or a quiet scene which you want to adjust, you have to grab your TV remote control and adjust the volume. I suppose the remote control would work better under the conditions of starting a movie by hitting the play button, and never touching the remote control until the movie ends, but I would not need a remote control then. I constantly make granular adjustments and the mediocre remote control of the XD-E500 doesn't come close to offering me the ability to do that.6. There is no "menu exit" button on the remote control. Say you press the Display button for the reasons I noted above. You take the time to interpret the crammed on-screen information, you have to press the Display button again to exit out of it. Remember that the Display button feels like every of the other 11 buttons crammed together in the contiguous grid of buttons at the bottom of the remote control. They should have put an "Exit" button on one of the corners of one of the contiguous grids at least. I had hope for a second though. There is a "Clear" button on the upper left of the contiguous grid, and I pressed that but a screen display warning came up: "Invalid operation".If you are OK with starting a movie and never interfacing with the DVD player until the end of it, the XD-E500 is probably a very good buy. If you have needs like I do, and perhaps have a DVD player which accommodates you in ways the Toshiba does not, you may want to seek a better solution. My final DVD player conclusion is, if I had to sum it up in a few words, that I did not realize what I had until it was gone.
$SUMMARY.: Poor usability + OK picture = Lousy DVD player

$REVIEW.: I must be out of touch with current price trends but I can't believe these were selling for $20!  I just tried out a set today and they sounded like they were worth half that.  I'm no audiophile and usually have my computer hooked up to an old boom box for sound but these speakers fell below my already low expectations.  The sound was weak and wasn't even as good as my small boom box.  On top of this, these speakers tip over WAY too easily.  For 20 bucks and an AC adapter for extra power, I expected a little more.
$SUMMARY.: I expected more for $20.

$review_text.: Had to pick up a controller so I could use my 430 off camera.  Decided to spring for a 580 over a ST-E2 and give myself some additional light options.  I was very happy with the 430 until I used the 580.  Amazing how much more flexibility it gives for diffusing light, and the scroll wheel over the 430 buttons are worth the price alone.  That said, I'm having a blast setting up my little 430 all over the place to splash additional light.  I have yet to position it (indoors) where it doesn't pick up the signal from the 580.  A happy amateur with some fancy pro equipment.Edit:  It's been about 6 months since I purchased the 580exII.  I now own a 580exII, a 430exII, a Yongnuo 460ii, and a Yongnuo 560.  The 580 is far superior to all in terms of ease of use and quality of construction.  However, it also costs significantly more than all the rest so you have to decide if it's worth it to you.  I found that I rarely ever use eTTL (all manual shooting with radio triggers), and some of the other features of the 580 like stroboscopic are neat but I don't use them often.  If I need on-camera flash for some reason I'll grab on of the Canons, but for off-camera work I usually don't care much which flash I grab, they all do more or less the same thing.

$review_text.: I have had mine for 6 years and it developed a problem with skipping on CDs.  I contacted Bose to see if anything could be done and even though it is long out of warranty, they are having me ship it back to them to be fixed for a total of about $70!!!  When it comes back to me (in no more than 3 weeks) it will basically be brand new and have a NEW WARRANTY!  Other than Amazon, I don't know of another company that stands by its products this well and really cares about its customers.  I'm so impressed that I had to share this with other "Amazonians."  It may seem expensive, but you don't need other speakers and the sound is great.  It took several years for anything to go wrong at all.Also, do yourself a favor and invest in the upgraded remote...it is fabulous.  Don't hesitate to buy a Bose product at all!

It's a decent enough setup and most users would probably be perfectly happy running with the standard configuration.I prefer to customize my setup a bit though, give my network my own name, set my own security key, etc. I spent about a 1/2 hour getting everything setup and looking into each and ever option on the router, however I had the basics done within five minutes or so.Speed throughput seems very good so far - I haven't done any major tests at any great distance yet, but have had no problems whatsoever. I have an 8Mbps cable connection and a speedtest on my iPad showed I was getting nearly 6Mbps via wireless to my iPad.This was a replacement for a Linksys "G" router and I like the fact that the antennas are internal on this Belkin unit, it's just a cleaner look and I don't have to worry about which way the antennas are pointing, etc.

$review_text.: The Grundig FR200 (available in a rainbow of colors) is touted as THE emergency radio, primarily due to it's hand-crank power system.  Never need batteries, always ready to play when you most need it. Put it in your emergency kit, and you'll be informed and entertained no matter what happens.  (You DO have an emergency kit, right?).  Also has a built-in flashlight, so you can read the labels on those stored cans of chili.The problem with the FR200 is twofold - one is the reception on all bands is just barely adequate.  The primary problem is the dial resolution. Trying to figure out what frequency you are tuned to (especially on shortwave and AM mediumwave) is difficult.  Sensitivity to weak stations and selectivity (separating closely-spaced stations) is mediocre.Then there is that hand-cranked dyanmo.  You crank it and it charges a little internal battery.  Two or three minutes of cranking that teeny little handle gives you about 30-40 minutes of playtime.  It does work as advertised, but the cranking handle doesn't have the strongest feel to it, and a little too-hardy cranking will break it off.  And there you are, in the middle of World War III or a volcano eruption, with no way to crank.  And no way to know what's going on.To be sure, the FR-200 is fun to play with, and as it's very lightweight, could serve as a camping radio/flashlight. Again, so long as you don't overdo the cranking.But for true emergency use, it's not the best option.  Batteries are relatively cheap, and last for years in storage.  (I'm still using batteries I stored for Y2K with no problem.) Go down to Costco or Sam's Club and get a brick of AA batteries. Put them in your kit and make a note to yourself to swap them out every five years or so. (You do have that emergency kit, don't you?)Then get an AM/FM radio with TV sound and weather band. Forget about shortwave - in a disaster like an earthquake or hurricane, Radio Havana isn't going to help you - you want local stations and TV sound. The Sony ICF-36 fits the bill perfectly.  Sangean also makes a good model, the DT-210V.Although the hand-crank-never-needs batteries sounds good, a better-performing radio and some stored batteries will save your bacon better than a broken crank handle.I did ask you if you had an emergency kit, right?

$REVIEW.: I want to start off by saying that I considered the Twelve South Version of this stand, but based on others review I was not considered that stand was sturdy enough to invest in.This stand however is a different story! It holds the Macbook in on both sides, and has rubber cushions inside to hold the Macbook firm and tight in the stand!  (Unlike the Twelve South version which is just basically a holster to slide the Mac in)The Rubber cushions on this stand are changeable, and you can change them for different models of the Macbook. I believe it comes with cushions for other Macbook Pro's Macbook Air's and Macbooks with Retina Displays.This stand is also constructed of heavy aluminum, much like the finish on the Macbook Pro is. This makes the stand very heavy, and thus, it does not slide around or wobbles on the desk when the Macbook is in it.  This also compliments the finish of the Macbook and it makes your desk look so sleek!Speaking of sleek, this Stand basically has no footprints! It has about a 4 inch by 4 inch base, and that is about it. It fits right along side my Dell 20 inch display! My Macbook looks very nice next to it ;)Perhaps a hidden feature in this stand, is the holes in the part inside that holds the Macbook down? I noticed air easily slips out and in through these holes, and thus cools the Macbook better, than if it was just on a desk.  Usually when just sitting on my desk, the Macbook is pretty hot.I wish I had purchased this product much earlier, I am very satisfied with this. If I could rate this 100 stars, I would!If you use your Macbook in Clamshell mode like I do, you should buy this. You will NOT be disappointed.

(This won't fit the recently-released newer version)We've bought other screen protectors, but after a few weeks these cheaper, no-name products would always start peeling in the corners.  We've always justified that it was cheaper to replace them than to buy a considerably higher priced one.  We've been pennywise and a pound foolish.  This product is VERY durable and the kicker is, is that it stays firm.We also got the frame to go along with it.This "Greatshield" is not your typical screen protector: it's better, a whole lot better (and, we're talking about 2.5x- 3x thicker.)A good investment for the 2011 Kindle Fire.

I had a pair of KOSS headphones from 40 years ago that engulfed your whole head&#8212;those were amazing for blocking noise. Unfortunately, the KOSS headphones pinched and hurt such that you could only wear them about an hour. Since blocking noise isn't really a selling point of these headphones, I won't lower the stars.

$review_text.: First time blu-ray player buyer. I have been watching my blu-rays on my PS3 for the last 4 years. The PS3 plays blu-rays well but the BDT210 is a significant step up for me. The one thing about this player that impresses me the most is its speed. This player is very fast. It smokes my PS3 and other players I have tried. There is really nothing about this player that I do not like. The setup was a breeze and the menus are very intuitive. After I setup the wireless (that was very easy) I updated the firmware which was also a breeze. The user interface is great.The picture is amazing. Up-converted DVDs look surprisingly good as well. 3D works very well. The support for mkv files is very nice as well. mkv videos look fantastic and the player handles different audio formats in these files very well.I love the touch free sensor. It is so nice in a dark room. The remote is also very well thought out.I'm very happy with my purchase!

$REVIEW.: This is a decent backup drive to save your data on.  The WD Anywhere Backup software lets you set up what files and folders you want backed up on a regular basis.  You can also use it with Windows One Care.  There should be a code in the directions where you can register WD Anywhere Backup for free.Windows users will want to convert the FAT drive to NTFS.  This may take a while, but it is necessary in order to save anything over 4 gig.The initial backup takes a while, it is a bit slow.  I also had one instance with the WD Anywhere Backup software where it lost my backup plan.  My files where still on the MyBook, but the plan was no longer recognized for real time backup and I had to make a new backup plan.Overall it's a good deal.  Lots of space for the price and it is very quiet.  You can add additional items on this drive to free up space on your computer.

$review_text.: First, beware that there is another version of this in the Amazon store that is exactly the same as this one. The difference is it says it's for the Macbook Air in the title and is $4 more! This case was not designed for the Macbook Air 11.6", rather any 11.6" netbook. It's upsetting that someone would take the same product, add "Macbook Air" to the title, and then raise the price. Amazon should take note of this sleazy tactic and remove this product: http://www.amazon.com/rooCASE-Netbook-Carrying-MacBook-11-6-inch/dp/B004BX0JQ2/The problem is that there aren't very many cases made for the new 11.6" Macbook Air.Thankfully it fits the Macbook Air 11.6" (late 2010 release) perfectly. Plus an iPad. Plus a few accessories such as a power cord.It is a very small case, made quite well. It has a front pocket that closes magnetically, for holding a mobile phone. I think it's silly and will never use it.There's a larger front pocket to hold quite a few things, and the pocket includes two pen slots and a pouch for holding something like an iPhone (it's about that size). There are no other pockets on the back or sides. It does include a fairly nice shoulder strap as well.PROS- Fits a Macbook Air 11.6" perfectly, with sufficient padding- Will also hold an iPad or something of similar size- The front pocket is just large enough to hold a power cableCONS- The orange accent color for the stitching and rubber feet is horrible and for me is every reason to look for another bag, and thus the 4/5 star review.- Front pocket for a MP3 player/phone is a waste (for me anyway)

$REVIEW.: Overall this is a nice little case.The packaging was minimal and recyclable and did not require power tools to open.The devices easily snap into the cases but still feel secure and unlikely to be inadvertently removed.While this color is officially called sorbet, it is much closer to a traditional pink.  Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but when I think of &#8220;sorbet&#8221; I think of orange Sherbert. Well, anyway, this case is pink.The overall appearance is subtle and does not scream tech.  When closed the device could easily be perceived to be a small note pad.The stand function is easy to use and works great.The case certainly provides adequate protection for the occasional toss on to the table or accidental placement of something on top of the kindle.  I wouldn&#8217;t go tossing my Kindle off the Empire State building &#8211; it isn&#8217;t THAT secure.My only complaint is that if you intend to use your kindle primarily for gaming, especially for kids the flap cover can become a bother.  It can sort of be folded back on itself, but the cover doesn&#8217;t fold back to a flat position so  is still a handful while playing games with gyroscopic functions.

$review_text.: It feels very tight and you have to be very attentive when attaching the lens, and is fidgety about attaching to the body without unlocking the lens, but it does work


The lock ring seems to rotate backwards, but that's because you're not turning it on the body, but on the lens, so it just 'feels' odd.The main problem is that even after feeling so tight when attaching, there's a pronounced click/wobble once it's all locked on - obviously only noticeable with longer or heavier glass, but it's still there


 It isn't enough to cause light leaks or affect images, but it is bothersome, and makes me nervously check it repeatedly when in use (think OCD)


 I'd also hate to warp a mounting face with a cheap adapter and cause myself a repair bill of 10 times the cost, so I'm ultra cautious

 I feed my family with my gear, so I may be a little overly sensitive.That said, it breathes new life into lenses I would otherwise just leave abandoned in a dark bag, so it was well worth the investment
 I've never been able to part with old glass; I'd likely keep it even if I couldn't use it - this just adds an option


YMMV

$review_text.: I got this product to add an SSD to our 13&#34; MacBook, Mid 2010 (MacBook7,1) and it fit perfectly. Obviously adding an SSD drastically improved the speed of our machine, and I'm intrigued by the new fusion drive technology. I decided to get this and a cheaper SSD mainly because I didn't want to spend the extra money on a bigger SSD. The only real issue is the difficulty installing it. If you follow a guide like those at iFixit, you shouldn't have too much trouble, although I had a hard time putting the screws back in place (and by hard time I mean some of them didn't quite make it...).ProsWorks as it should. Huge speed increase with the SSD.ConsWhile not technically difficult to install, it does require taking out and putting back in some EXTREMELY small screws.Other ThoughtsI put the SSD in the main HDD slot as recommended by some of the other reviewers. I noticed that when I booted to the drive in this enclosure so I could install the OS on the SSD, I had a few system crashes and needed to restart. Since using it as storage only though, I haven't had any problems.

$REVIEW.: This Linksys router is quite easy to set up. It seems that most "set-up" software is junk designed to load a bunch of things you don't really need and slow down your cpu at start up. The Linksys utility does a quick job configuring all the computers on your network along with security for your wireless needs. There's no subsequent typing of passwords, and a 1 minute download is all you need to get the set up utility that automatically sync's with the router. Cool.

$review_text.: This is an awesome digital antenna. Fist note, this is NOT for VHF signals (it was not designed for them and is optimized for the UHF HD frequency range). Now, if you are getting it for the digital spectrum, it's pretty incredible. You should verify what over the air signals are being sent in your area before purchasing this or any other antenna. You can go directly to the manufactures' site and they have links that can give you an idea of what is available in your area and whether this antenna would fit your purpose.It's not too big (there are smaller versions, as this is their largest). Our OTA digital channels come in crisp and clear. Between this (for the local standard channels) and streaming, we have 'cut the cable'. It's been wonderful.

$review_text.: I got a shopworn 8GB version with 1 GB RAM for $375 or about $125 off normal retail.Pros:*Boots in 10 to 15 seconds, or about 1 1/2 minutes quicker than XP*No bloatware from the factory.  You get applications  with no nag ads for AOL or some credit card you didn't ask for.*Except for touchpad, well built*Recognizes printers, cameras, etc and will even download drivers if necessary, all w/o your interference.  Try that with XP (has the driver "find" system ever worked on XP?)*About 2 pounds*2 year warranty*Uses a cell phone style charger instead of the heavy brick*Voice commands easy to turn on.  My IBM Thinkpad doesn't offer that.  Talk and activate programs.*Better speakers than 99% of the laptops, which isn't saying much.  Won't outplay your Pioneer stereo, but it will sound better than most MP3 players out there*Finds network signals I didn't know exist*Disturbingly quiet.  After years of listening to grinding hard drives and fans, it's somewhat disconcerting to hear nothing (and I do mean nothing!).*Don't let Linux scare you, it's a generic version of Windows and the included O/S is designed for the techologically limited.Cons:*2 1/2 hour battery?  Ever hear of lithium?*Runs hot, typical Celeron.  Doesn't bog down, though*Touchpad is useless, fortunately mine came with a mouse*If the webcam works, it's hiding*Keypad takes time to get used to.  Helps to have paperclip thin fingers.  Get a wireless keyboard unless you enjoy cramping.*Nice that it comes with a neoprene carrying bag, but they forget an area for the charger.  Relatively worthless*Downloading new applications can be a bear if you don't understand Linux.  Fortunately, I do.Overall?  You really can't lose.  My guess is the HDDs will get larger as time goes on and MS is offering Windows XP as an option in 2008.  As long as Vista doesn't creep in there, it's a good deal for those on the go!

$review_text.: I have tried and looked for wide angle cameras on Amazon and this is the best camera for the money, hands down! The other cameras that I have tried just didn't have the wide angle even though they stated they were. In my situation I have used the cameras that were bundled with my DVR but I was disappointed with the overall view, for instance I wanted to get the view of the front and rear yards.Most bundled cameras can only cover 1/4 to 1/2 of 25 foot wide yard, meaning that I would need at least two of these regular cameras to cover these areas. I was impressed that with this camera I was able to see the entire yard with only one camera, I haven't even tried adjusting the zoom and focus because the factory settings worked great. With the help of the Metal Halide yard light this camera displays in full color even at night. The one that I installed for the front yard has a great picture too, it covers the entire 25 foot yard and sidewalk/street area. It too is in color but less so because the only lights in front are the street lights. With my other cameras when it got dark outside I basically lost the picture because of the low lighting, the night vision on these cameras give a great picture, I even get a good picture before the street lights kick in.The only two cons was the mounting system and the different models that I received.I ordered one camera on 9/11/12 and it was fulfilled by CCTVONE and I received the model listed on this page (EV-CDM368IRV), the 2nd one I ordered on 11/25/12 was fulfilled by Evertech-USA and I received Model # EV-CDM368IR V.7. The main difference is that the EV-CDM368IR V.7 has the the on screen display (OSD) so that you can make many adjustments to the camera such as back lighting, and picture adjustments (Brightness, Contrast, etc.) which works great. So if you want this feature then choose Evertech as the seller when order and hopefully you will get the EV-CDM368IR V.7 model. this model is also easier to mount because after you install the base to the wall it has a large outer ring that screws onto the base which is much easier. With the other camera model the outer ring is attached to the base with 3 small allen screws which can be a pain when you are trying to hold the camera and tighten the screws.Overall this is a great camera and I highly recommend it

I purchased it specifically for the combination of price and length; other cables that I found locally were much more expensive and much longer.  The cable is very thick and stiff, but I found tht by putting it in the sun for a while the cable softened just enough to allow me to work it into the shape I needed to fit the space.

$REVIEW.: It's generally assumed that this hard drive trades access speed for energy efficiency. If so, I've found that it's not noticeably slower than any other hard drive, as used in my home desktop PC.Two minor complaints about the hard drive -- too minor to detract from the rating:1) The included mounting screws were quite short. Perhaps the case I'm using is non-standard, in that there's some empty space to allow for thick rubber gaskets between the drive and the case frame, but I had a difficult time mounting the drive, and I'll have to get longer screws to mount it more securely.2) The box says that the drive is compatible with Windows and Mac OS X. It doesn't mention that it's compatible with Linux. Of course, it would be compatible with any modern operating system. Perhaps the compatibility refers only to the installation software, which isn't really necessary anyway, since any modern operating system will have the utilities to handle setting up a hard drive.
$SUMMARY.: It works well for me

$REVIEW.: This is a nice little laptop sleeve. I can put my old HP laptop in it. Unfortunately, I can't put my other laptop in it, but that was expected, because it was meant for very thin laptops. So now I just use it for my old laptop.I just wish it was big enough to put my AC adapter into it somewhere. If it was able to carry an AC adapter, it would be great. Then I could take it anywhere, but the way it is right now, I wouldn't want to use it for travel. I would rather use my laptop bookbag for travel. Right now, I'm just using it as a protective device at home, which allows me to lay my computer anywhere.  If that was just the intention of the sleeve, than it works great. I also wish there was more to it, like a pocket for a pen or a jump drive.

$review_text.: Like most others have written in their reviews, bass is definitely lacking.  That was obvious from the first moment I listened to them.  I'm by no means an audiophile and I don't like booming bass, but I know when something is missing. I listen to anything from classical to Hank Williams Jr (and all in between), even audio books, depending on my mood. If I listen to classical, mostly high strings like violins, the phones are pretty decent.  But if there is cello or bass to be mixed in, you are quite likely to miss it.  It just doesn't come through.The overall construction seems quite good but here is where (for me), RHA missed the boat.  If you are going to sit at a keyboard and pound away all day with the earphones plugged in, these phones should do you well.  I use my ear buds mostly when I take our dog for her 2 mile daily walk.  There seems to be zero chance of the earphones staying in my ears.  They keep falling out at even a moderate pace.  Mind you, I'm in my 60's so I am not breaking any speed limits when I walk.  I tried all three sets of silicon inserts and none will stay in either of my ears.  I refuse to duct tape them in &lt;grin>.  Perhaps RHA has a product similar to EARBUDi clips (sold elsewhere on Amazon)? So, essentially, I have a set of earphones that I can only use at home or at work when I'm at the computer, which is not what I wanted them for. That makes them not very usable nor valuable to me and why I rate them only 3 stars. Think how you will use them before you purchase them. Other reviewers have also mentioned the buds will not stay in their ears.If you plan on going running or jogging with these, don't.  They won't stay in unless you can find a product to connect to them that will hook around your ears..  If you're a computer junkie, you'll be fine although truthfully, I think some of the lesser priced headphones will probably give you audio that is just as acceptable and may even stay in your ears.

$REVIEW.: I thought the hot key idea would be awesome but I guess it goes with a few quirks. First of all. it only has 2 hot key settings. Either you use the scroll lock key (double tap) or the ctrl keys (also double tap) Which, if you use windows double tapping Ctrl causes it to select multiple items that you click on and also open everything in a new windows/tab. (I tried turning this off in the control panel and everywhere but nothing worked.) So I recommend sticking with scroll lock. Also, I have a backlit keyboard. and since this device is powered by usb. You would think when the computer shuts off, so does USB power to the ports. Wrong. well at least in my case. It seems that one of my computers. continuously supplies power even when powered off. No big deal though. Lastly sometimes the switch will get stuck on one computer. This is mainly caused when the computer its currently doing some intense processing or is being held up by a program not responding. Then again this happens very rarely and has never happened to me while running Windows. Other than the above, Its a great little switch for running two machines with only one keyboard and mouse. BE WARNED. Wireless Mice and Keyboards (Especially combos) will not function correctly if at all. This switch is designed for Wired USB Keyboards and mice.Pros:Hotkeys to control switchingLED lights identifying current connectionMultiple connection options (Mouse/keyboard, Sound, and VGA)Long cablesSmall size (set it and forget it.)Compatible with just about any operating environment (Including linux)Cons:Can be a little quirky with linux sometimesDoesn't work well with wireless keyboards and miceAlways on.
